00:00:00,104 --> 00:00:07,292
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:08,887 --> 00:00:10,627
(Episode 12)

3
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:19,197
No. Why should I have to hide?

4
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:23,406
Seeing how you were about to hide,

5
00:00:23,406 --> 00:00:25,176
I guess you do know
that you did something wrong.

6
00:00:25,707 --> 00:00:28,047
What? Wrong?

7
00:00:28,246 --> 00:00:29,606
What did I do wrong?

8
00:00:30,047 --> 00:00:31,777
Who do you think you're talking to?

9
00:00:33,277 --> 00:00:34,586
Look at the way you're talking.

10
00:00:36,987 --> 00:00:39,016
Gosh,
I shouldn't even bother with you.

11
00:00:39,917 --> 00:00:42,557
What? Who are you to say that to me?

12
00:00:42,657 --> 00:00:44,457
You sent your mother-in-law
to threaten me...

13
00:00:44,457 --> 00:00:46,157
and even took money from me.

14
00:00:46,996 --> 00:00:49,366
Money? What money?

15
00:00:50,466 --> 00:00:52,296
How dare you try to act innocent?

16
00:00:52,296 --> 00:00:54,067
You sent your mother-in-law,
threatened me,

17
00:00:54,067 --> 00:00:55,436
and ripped off the principal
and interest.

18
00:00:55,436 --> 00:00:56,667
It was 50,000 dollars in total.

19
00:00:56,667 --> 00:00:58,277
I even received a memorandum for it.

20
00:00:58,277 --> 00:01:00,606
How dare you act like
you don't know anything about it?

21
00:01:01,076 --> 00:01:02,207
Did you say 50,000 dollars?

22
00:01:03,006 --> 00:01:04,246
My mother-in-law?

23
00:01:04,246 --> 00:01:06,146
Let me be clear with you.

24
00:01:06,146 --> 00:01:08,987
You may have hustled me once,
but I won't let that happen again.

25
00:01:09,046 --> 00:01:11,216
If you do anything despicable...

26
00:01:11,216 --> 00:01:13,357
like outing me
for not paying back your money...

27
00:01:13,357 --> 00:01:15,827
just to squeeze more money
out of me,

28
00:01:15,827 --> 00:01:19,157
I'll report you to the police
on charges of blackmailing.

29
00:01:19,157 --> 00:01:20,696
Remember that.

30
00:01:21,926 --> 00:01:23,267
What a lousy day.

31
00:01:24,196 --> 00:01:25,297
What the...

32
00:01:26,767 --> 00:01:27,967
I can't believe it.

33
00:01:31,976 --> 00:01:35,607
That's all the more reason
why we should get the money back.

34
00:01:35,707 --> 00:01:38,247
Hey, it was 30,000 dollars
15 years ago.

35
00:01:38,247 --> 00:01:39,877
It was a huge amount
of money back then.

36
00:01:41,517 --> 00:01:42,646
No way.

37
00:01:43,586 --> 00:01:44,657
Could she have...

38
00:01:46,616 --> 00:01:47,717
Mother.

39
00:01:47,957 --> 00:01:49,056
Goodness me.

40
00:01:49,786 --> 00:01:51,756
What is the matter with you?

41
00:01:51,756 --> 00:01:52,926
What the...

42
00:01:53,256 --> 00:01:55,666
How dare you glare
at your mother-in-law?

43
00:01:55,967 --> 00:01:57,097
Mother,

44
00:01:58,036 --> 00:01:59,937
did you receive
50,000 dollars from her?

45
00:02:00,136 --> 00:02:01,136
What?

46
00:02:01,136 --> 00:02:03,767
Is it true that you received
50,000 dollars from Do Ra's mom?

47
00:02:06,407 --> 00:02:09,176
Sun Young, my gosh.

48
00:02:09,176 --> 00:02:13,146
How on earth did you find out?

49
00:02:13,146 --> 00:02:14,176
Did...

50
00:02:14,817 --> 00:02:17,717
Did Hyun Chul tell you?

51
00:02:17,717 --> 00:02:18,756
What?

52
00:02:20,286 --> 00:02:23,627
Does Hyun Chul know about it too?

53
00:02:24,696 --> 00:02:28,497
Did you and Hyun Chul
receive the money together?

54
00:02:29,296 --> 00:02:30,927
Gosh.

55
00:02:30,927 --> 00:02:33,296
Please tell me, Mother.

56
00:02:33,296 --> 00:02:34,937
Is it true?

57
00:02:35,337 --> 00:02:38,036
How could you do this?

58
00:02:38,036 --> 00:02:40,506
Mom, what...

59
00:02:41,476 --> 00:02:44,546
Honey, what's going on?

60
00:02:45,516 --> 00:02:46,777
Honey, did you...

61
00:02:47,546 --> 00:02:49,946
Did you really receive
that money from her?

62
00:02:51,356 --> 00:02:53,057
What money?

63
00:02:53,886 --> 00:02:57,356
Hyun Chul, what do we do?

64
00:02:57,356 --> 00:03:00,397
Sun Young found out...

65
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:01,627
about the 50,000 dollars.

66
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:04,097
Honey.

67
00:03:04,497 --> 00:03:07,736
Honey, how could you?

68
00:03:08,736 --> 00:03:10,106
How could you take that money?

69
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,177
How could you when you know
what that money means to me?

70
00:03:12,877 --> 00:03:16,206
Honey, I'm sorry.
I did the unthinkable.

71
00:03:16,206 --> 00:03:17,606
Where's the money?

72
00:03:18,217 --> 00:03:19,946
Bring it to me immediately.

73
00:03:19,946 --> 00:03:21,747
We don't have the money anymore.

74
00:03:21,747 --> 00:03:24,247
We were conned out of it.

75
00:03:24,247 --> 00:03:26,657
Hyun Chul's friend
took off with the money.

76
00:03:27,786 --> 00:03:28,856
What?

77
00:03:29,886 --> 00:03:30,927
Honey.

78
00:03:31,326 --> 00:03:34,696
I invested the money
into the business I once mentioned,

79
00:03:34,696 --> 00:03:35,726
but...

80
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:38,196
How...

81
00:03:39,597 --> 00:03:41,407
How could you of all people...

82
00:03:42,907 --> 00:03:45,437
And with the money
that was my father's...

83
00:03:46,536 --> 00:03:48,076
How could you do this to me?

84
00:03:49,046 --> 00:03:52,976
Have you lost your mind? Have you?

85
00:03:53,747 --> 00:03:56,046
Don't you remember
how my father passed away?

86
00:03:57,087 --> 00:03:59,286
My father died
because of that woman,

87
00:03:59,286 --> 00:04:02,786
and my heart
is still covered in bruises.

88
00:04:03,886 --> 00:04:05,856
How could you do this to me?

89
00:04:05,856 --> 00:04:07,597
How could you?

90
00:04:07,597 --> 00:04:09,927
- How could you?
- Sun Young, please.

91
00:04:09,927 --> 00:04:11,766
- How could you do this to me?
- Sun Young.

92
00:04:11,766 --> 00:04:14,236
Sun Young, that's enough.

93
00:04:14,236 --> 00:04:17,567
He thought about killing himself...

94
00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:19,076
after he lost that money.

95
00:04:19,736 --> 00:04:22,677
I stopped him
from jumping off an overpass.

96
00:04:22,677 --> 00:04:25,547
So please...
Sun Young, that's enough.

97
00:04:25,877 --> 00:04:26,977
Please.

98
00:04:30,817 --> 00:04:32,586
Look. It's Assistant Director Ko.

99
00:04:32,586 --> 00:04:34,256
Bong Soo, you're here early.

100
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:35,787
Where have you been?

101
00:04:35,787 --> 00:04:37,386
Someone came to see me.

102
00:04:37,386 --> 00:04:38,526
I see.

103
00:04:39,326 --> 00:04:41,196
Director Hong. Bong Soo.

104
00:04:41,196 --> 00:04:44,326
Park Do Ra, hey there.

105
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:46,067
The heroine
of "Straightforward Romance."

106
00:04:46,067 --> 00:04:48,067
The Queen of Romance,
Actress Park Do Ra is here.

107
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:50,706
Director Hong,
you're embarrassing me.

108
00:04:57,247 --> 00:04:59,877
The elevator is here.
Queen Do Ra, after you.

109
00:05:02,047 --> 00:05:04,346
Let's go. Come on.

110
00:05:04,547 --> 00:05:05,787
Here we go.

111
00:05:05,787 --> 00:05:07,256
I'm off to enjoy
something delicious.

112
00:05:07,256 --> 00:05:08,586
- Just a second.
- Yes, something delicious.

113
00:05:08,586 --> 00:05:09,586
Wait up!

114
00:05:09,857 --> 00:05:11,557
- Goodness.
- Good work, guys. Get in.

115
00:05:11,557 --> 00:05:13,896
- You all did a great job.
- Good job, guys.

116
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:17,826
Mr. Jang couldn't stop talking...

117
00:05:17,826 --> 00:05:20,567
about how huge of a hit
the first episode was.

118
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:22,307
- I know.
- Gosh.

119
00:05:22,307 --> 00:05:23,836
The food here is to die for.

120
00:05:23,836 --> 00:05:25,607
- I mean it.
- You can't eat here often.

121
00:05:25,607 --> 00:05:26,737
It's reserved for special occasions.

122
00:05:26,737 --> 00:05:27,836
Starting this evening.

123
00:05:27,836 --> 00:05:29,477
The food here is incredible.

124
00:05:29,877 --> 00:05:30,977
I'm starving.

125
00:05:30,977 --> 00:05:32,247
That's why you should
have your fill here.

126
00:05:32,247 --> 00:05:34,346
This isn't a place
you get to eat at often.

127
00:05:36,187 --> 00:05:37,187
Tell me about it.

128
00:05:37,187 --> 00:05:38,557
- The food is to die for.
- Really?

129
00:05:39,487 --> 00:05:40,586
Let's enjoy it.

130
00:05:40,586 --> 00:05:43,927
- I'm going to have everything.
- Everything is good.

131
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:46,797
For the huge success
of "Straightforward Romance!"

132
00:05:46,797 --> 00:05:48,627
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

133
00:05:48,627 --> 00:05:49,966
(We will always move forward.)

134
00:05:49,966 --> 00:05:51,266
(Great work,
Team "Straightforward Romance.")

135
00:05:54,737 --> 00:05:55,867
All right.

136
00:05:56,367 --> 00:05:59,037
After our series premiered,

137
00:05:59,037 --> 00:06:00,477
it was talked about on portal sites.

138
00:06:00,477 --> 00:06:02,247
And we saw an incredible rating.

139
00:06:02,247 --> 00:06:05,917
The show truly is
the talk of the town,

140
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:08,487
and I owe it to all of you.

141
00:06:09,047 --> 00:06:12,516
The executive director
granted me this credit card today.

142
00:06:12,656 --> 00:06:14,516
Enjoy all that you want.

143
00:06:14,516 --> 00:06:18,256
Let the show reach
a rating of 30 percent!

144
00:06:18,256 --> 00:06:21,497
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

145
00:06:27,437 --> 00:06:29,107
(Park Do Ra and Cha Bong Soo.
Is there love in the air?)

146
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:41,987
Drink up.

147
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:46,617
- Do Ra.
- Yes?

148
00:06:46,987 --> 00:06:49,127
While filming this series,
you changed my perception of you.

149
00:06:49,727 --> 00:06:52,826
Do Ra, you truly are
the Queen of Ratings.

150
00:06:53,627 --> 00:06:55,567
This is my first time
being on a show...

151
00:06:55,567 --> 00:06:56,896
with such a high rating.

152
00:06:57,427 --> 00:06:58,537
Do Ra,

153
00:06:58,537 --> 00:07:01,737
there was a bit of trouble
when we first started filming,

154
00:07:02,336 --> 00:07:05,677
but I had a blast working with you.

155
00:07:05,677 --> 00:07:06,977
We had good chemistry as well.

156
00:07:08,237 --> 00:07:10,107
I had fun working with you too.

157
00:07:10,646 --> 00:07:12,117
- Really?
- Yes.

158
00:07:12,117 --> 00:07:14,617
I hope I get to work with you again.

159
00:07:15,946 --> 00:07:16,987
What about you?

160
00:07:18,047 --> 00:07:20,516
What about you? Tell me.

161
00:07:20,516 --> 00:07:23,326
- Come on. Tell me.
- Fine.

162
00:07:23,326 --> 00:07:25,127
We'll work together again
if the opportunity allows it.

163
00:07:25,127 --> 00:07:26,456
Really? You heard that, didn't you?

164
00:07:26,456 --> 00:07:27,896
Of course.
You should work together again.

165
00:07:28,256 --> 00:07:29,427
- Mr. Gong is here.
- Gosh.

166
00:07:29,427 --> 00:07:30,966
What? Mr. Gong, you're here.

167
00:07:31,937 --> 00:07:33,797
Mr. Gong, you came.

168
00:07:33,797 --> 00:07:35,336
- Right.
- Please come this way.

169
00:07:38,037 --> 00:07:39,307
Please sit here.

170
00:07:41,646 --> 00:07:44,547
You guys did a great job.

171
00:07:44,807 --> 00:07:47,317
- Cheers.
- Allow me to pour you a glass.

172
00:07:48,016 --> 00:07:49,086
Mr. Gong,

173
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,346
thank you so much.

174
00:07:52,317 --> 00:07:54,417
Thanks to your unlimited support,

175
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,287
Do Ra and I...

176
00:07:57,256 --> 00:07:59,256
were able to play our characters
without any added stress.

177
00:07:59,297 --> 00:08:02,367
We were able to love
with all our hearts.

178
00:08:02,966 --> 00:08:04,067
Wait. Where's Do Ra?

179
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,297
- Do Ra, isn't that right?
- Sure.

180
00:08:21,446 --> 00:08:23,386
Oh, my goodness.

181
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:25,456
Slow down, Mr. Gong.

182
00:08:27,357 --> 00:08:28,956
- Mr. Cha.
- Yes?

183
00:08:30,086 --> 00:08:31,487
I have something to say in private.

184
00:08:32,156 --> 00:08:33,326
Can I have a word?

185
00:08:34,497 --> 00:08:35,567
In private?

186
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:38,567
I'd be honored.

187
00:08:42,137 --> 00:08:43,206
In private.

188
00:08:51,876 --> 00:08:54,047
Mr. Gong,
you don't have to do this, really.

189
00:08:59,817 --> 00:09:02,086
Why are you doing this to me?

190
00:09:02,086 --> 00:09:04,057
You arrogant punk. How dare you?

191
00:09:04,887 --> 00:09:06,726
Who are you to go after my woman?

192
00:09:07,027 --> 00:09:08,427
I'll kill you today.

193
00:09:09,826 --> 00:09:11,366
Darn you.

194
00:09:11,366 --> 00:09:14,037
She's mine.
Who do you think you are?

195
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,336
You punk.

196
00:09:16,137 --> 00:09:17,137
Come here.

197
00:09:18,807 --> 00:09:20,076
Come at me.

198
00:09:20,076 --> 00:09:22,507
- What's going on?
- Stop it. Stop!

199
00:09:22,746 --> 00:09:24,007
- Get him off.
- Let go of me.

200
00:09:24,007 --> 00:09:25,746
- Let go.
- Don't, Bong Soo.

201
00:09:25,746 --> 00:09:26,946
Let's fight this out!

202
00:09:26,946 --> 00:09:28,787
Stop it. Talk it out instead.

203
00:09:28,817 --> 00:09:30,446
That guy's out of his mind.

204
00:09:30,446 --> 00:09:32,557
He lured me here
saying he wanted to talk,

205
00:09:32,557 --> 00:09:34,017
then he punched me!

206
00:09:34,017 --> 00:09:35,956
So what if you're a CEO?

207
00:09:35,956 --> 00:09:37,086
Why did you punch me?

208
00:09:37,086 --> 00:09:39,027
Don't you hit on Park Do Ra again.

209
00:09:39,297 --> 00:09:41,397
If you do,
things will get way worse than this.

210
00:09:41,427 --> 00:09:43,366
I'll bury you alive!

211
00:09:43,927 --> 00:09:45,537
What? Park Do Ra?

212
00:09:45,866 --> 00:09:47,897
What are you on about?
Are you crazy?

213
00:09:47,897 --> 00:09:50,706
I'm dating Bi Bi.
She's my girlfriend.

214
00:09:50,706 --> 00:09:51,777
Shut your mouth!

215
00:09:51,836 --> 00:09:54,736
You said you got to
love Do Ra all you wanted!

216
00:09:54,736 --> 00:09:56,446
That CEO really is out of his mind.

217
00:09:56,446 --> 00:09:58,106
I was talking about the drama.

218
00:09:58,206 --> 00:10:00,917
I meant I got to act my heart out
like I loved her.

219
00:10:01,246 --> 00:10:03,687
Forget it. Get Do Ra!

220
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,187
Get her to explain!

221
00:10:05,887 --> 00:10:07,257
What's going on?

222
00:10:07,517 --> 00:10:09,887
Why did you say my name?
What did I do?

223
00:10:10,187 --> 00:10:11,226
Ms. Park.

224
00:10:11,557 --> 00:10:13,696
Did you reject me
for the likes of him?

225
00:10:14,126 --> 00:10:15,427
For someone like him?

226
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:17,726
- What?
- Park Do Ra.

227
00:10:17,726 --> 00:10:19,696
You be honest. Do you like me?

228
00:10:19,736 --> 00:10:21,096
I don't like you.

229
00:10:21,096 --> 00:10:22,736
I reconciled with Bi Bi.

230
00:10:23,037 --> 00:10:24,866
Did you tell him you liked me?

231
00:10:24,866 --> 00:10:26,277
What are you on about?

232
00:10:26,277 --> 00:10:28,106
Bong Soo and I are just colleagues.

233
00:10:28,907 --> 00:10:30,846
Mr. Gong. What's all this about?

234
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:33,716
Do Ra.

235
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:36,417
Are you and that Cha Gong Soo...

236
00:10:37,787 --> 00:10:39,017
really not dating?

237
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,126
Go home, Mr. Gong.

238
00:10:42,126 --> 00:10:43,956
- You should leave.
- Do Ra.

239
00:10:43,956 --> 00:10:45,326
- Let me explain.
- Come on.

240
00:10:45,326 --> 00:10:47,757
- It's not what...
- "The likes of me?"

241
00:10:47,757 --> 00:10:49,927
How great do you think you are?
You're just rich!

242
00:10:49,927 --> 00:10:51,067
Stop it.

243
00:10:51,696 --> 00:10:54,567
Pil Seung. Why did I get punched?

244
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,736
- That punk.
- What's wrong with Mr. Gong?

245
00:11:07,817 --> 00:11:09,716
- Goodness.
- Jin Gu. Mr. Gong left?

246
00:11:09,946 --> 00:11:11,017
What did he say?

247
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:13,287
He said
there was a misunderstanding.

248
00:11:13,456 --> 00:11:15,387
He just left
as if he were embarrassed.

249
00:11:15,956 --> 00:11:17,687
Even if he were angry,

250
00:11:17,687 --> 00:11:19,226
how could a CEO...

251
00:11:19,226 --> 00:11:21,696
act so rashly at the wrap party?

252
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:24,767
I didn't think
he'd be so arrogant and rude.

253
00:11:24,996 --> 00:11:26,096
Neither did I.

254
00:11:26,297 --> 00:11:28,037
I found him odd...

255
00:11:28,037 --> 00:11:30,606
when he sent flowers
and a food truck to the set.

256
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:35,807
Do you think there was something
between Do Ra and Mr. Gong?

257
00:11:36,576 --> 00:11:37,706
There wasn't.

258
00:11:37,807 --> 00:11:39,517
What? There wasn't.

259
00:11:40,716 --> 00:11:41,986
What I mean is...

260
00:11:43,147 --> 00:11:45,317
Ms. Park said no, so there wasn't.

261
00:11:46,757 --> 00:11:49,856
No one in her right mind
would date a guy like that.

262
00:11:50,726 --> 00:11:53,157
He ruined a great evening.

263
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:54,826
Why did he have to come anyway?

264
00:11:55,226 --> 00:11:56,567
What a mess.

265
00:11:57,366 --> 00:11:58,397
Darn it.

266
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:02,307
Park Do Ra and him.

267
00:12:02,836 --> 00:12:05,976
It must've been serious
if he'd start a fight for her.

268
00:12:06,236 --> 00:12:07,277
I know, right?

269
00:12:08,007 --> 00:12:09,777
Chimneys smoke for a reason.

270
00:12:09,846 --> 00:12:12,116
It means someone lit a fire.

271
00:12:12,876 --> 00:12:13,917
I guess.

272
00:12:14,346 --> 00:12:16,787
Do Ra is always the problem.

273
00:12:16,787 --> 00:12:19,417
First,
she made Bong Soo and Bi Bi fight,

274
00:12:19,557 --> 00:12:21,216
and now it's Bong Soo and Mr. Gong.

275
00:12:22,126 --> 00:12:23,826
Who does she think she is?

276
00:12:24,287 --> 00:12:26,257
She caused such a mess.

277
00:12:26,696 --> 00:12:27,696
Let's go.

278
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:12,076
It's all right. It's fine.

279
00:13:14,937 --> 00:13:15,976
Pil Seung.

280
00:13:16,976 --> 00:13:19,716
I really am not seeing Mr. Gong.

281
00:13:20,846 --> 00:13:22,317
Nothing happened between us.

282
00:13:23,787 --> 00:13:26,917
You don't think of me
the way the others do, do you?

283
00:13:31,257 --> 00:13:33,996
Why would you say that?
Think of you in what way?

284
00:13:34,297 --> 00:13:35,466
Don't say that.

285
00:13:36,527 --> 00:13:39,496
I think people got me all wrong.

286
00:13:40,797 --> 00:13:43,907
That Mr. Gong wouldn't have
acted like that for no reason.

287
00:13:45,037 --> 00:13:47,407
That he did so
because we had something.

288
00:13:47,736 --> 00:13:50,106
What he did had nothing to do with you.

289
00:13:50,576 --> 00:13:53,116
He acted out
because he had the wrong idea.

290
00:13:53,277 --> 00:13:54,476
They all saw that.

291
00:13:55,746 --> 00:13:58,246
They won't get
the wrong idea about you.

292
00:14:00,086 --> 00:14:01,216
Do you think so?

293
00:14:02,027 --> 00:14:03,057
Yes.

294
00:14:04,027 --> 00:14:05,427
You denied it, and that's that.

295
00:14:08,726 --> 00:14:12,366
The truth will come out in time.

296
00:14:12,996 --> 00:14:14,767
Don't mind people...

297
00:14:15,336 --> 00:14:17,767
who don't know
the whole story or just gossip.

298
00:14:18,736 --> 00:14:22,106
Forget about
what happened today, okay?

299
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:27,677
Okay.

300
00:14:30,417 --> 00:14:32,216
You're such a good girl, Do Ra.

301
00:14:33,917 --> 00:14:36,326
What shall we do tomorrow?

302
00:14:36,726 --> 00:14:38,027
You said you're free.

303
00:14:38,456 --> 00:14:40,297
What do you want to do?
Name anything.

304
00:14:40,927 --> 00:14:43,126
I'm okay with anything
as long as you're with me.

305
00:14:44,126 --> 00:14:45,567
Visit a nice restaurant,

306
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:48,067
watch a movie, or go on a drive.

307
00:14:48,336 --> 00:14:49,767
I'm up for anything.

308
00:15:07,057 --> 00:15:10,027
What psycho drives like that
so early in the morning?

309
00:15:14,596 --> 00:15:16,226
Isn't that Mr. Gong?

310
00:15:17,027 --> 00:15:19,267
Why is he glaring at me?

311
00:15:25,137 --> 00:15:26,376
Mr. Gong.

312
00:15:26,706 --> 00:15:29,976
What are you doing here
this morning?

313
00:15:31,576 --> 00:15:32,716
Ms. Baek.

314
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:36,517
Do Ra's not interested in me at all.

315
00:15:36,817 --> 00:15:38,287
She doesn't like me.

316
00:15:38,746 --> 00:15:41,616
Why did you gaslight me as if...

317
00:15:41,856 --> 00:15:44,427
she liked me
and was interested in me?

318
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:46,797
I fell for your lies.

319
00:15:46,797 --> 00:15:48,866
Do you know what I did in public?

320
00:15:49,966 --> 00:15:51,466
Do Ra wasn't interested,

321
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:54,037
but I threw myself at her,
and now everyone thinks...

322
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:55,236
I'm a stupid loser.

323
00:15:56,466 --> 00:15:59,437
Are you blaming me for that?

324
00:15:59,907 --> 00:16:02,277
You said you liked Do Ra.

325
00:16:02,277 --> 00:16:05,517
You have no idea
how much pressure I put on her.

326
00:16:05,517 --> 00:16:07,147
I helped you as best I could,

327
00:16:07,147 --> 00:16:09,486
but you failed to captivate her.

328
00:16:09,486 --> 00:16:11,287
What more do you want from me?

329
00:16:11,486 --> 00:16:12,486
Goodness.

330
00:16:13,216 --> 00:16:15,356
I've given up.

331
00:16:15,356 --> 00:16:18,657
I don't know what happens.
It's all up to you now.

332
00:16:20,557 --> 00:16:22,027
You made me look bad...

333
00:16:22,767 --> 00:16:24,067
and you don't care?

334
00:16:28,037 --> 00:16:29,106
Ms. Baek.

335
00:16:29,866 --> 00:16:31,407
Do you still think nothing of me?

336
00:16:32,606 --> 00:16:33,736
Am I a nobody?

337
00:16:34,437 --> 00:16:37,677
Mr. Gong. Why would you say that?

338
00:16:37,677 --> 00:16:39,677
If you hadn't
gas-lit me into thinking...

339
00:16:39,677 --> 00:16:41,777
Do Ra would fall for me,

340
00:16:42,787 --> 00:16:44,387
I wouldn't have come this far.

341
00:16:45,446 --> 00:16:48,956
You said Do Ra liked me
and thought I was cool.

342
00:16:49,387 --> 00:16:50,956
That's why I went after her.

343
00:16:52,257 --> 00:16:53,356
I'm saying...

344
00:16:54,456 --> 00:16:57,927
you toyed with me
and made me look pathetic.

345
00:16:59,366 --> 00:17:00,767
It's time to pay the price.

346
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:04,206
Mr. Gong.

347
00:17:04,907 --> 00:17:07,736
Who gas-lit you and toyed with you?

348
00:17:08,037 --> 00:17:09,706
That's nonsense.

349
00:17:09,706 --> 00:17:13,017
I did that to you?
Does that make sense?

350
00:17:13,777 --> 00:17:15,017
Let's not drag this on.

351
00:17:15,817 --> 00:17:17,717
I'll give you just one month.

352
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:20,856
You have one month
to change Do Ra's mind...

353
00:17:20,856 --> 00:17:22,186
and have her come to me.

354
00:17:23,487 --> 00:17:25,487
If you don't,

355
00:17:26,396 --> 00:17:30,497
I'll make sure your daughter
is done for good as a celebrity.

356
00:17:33,467 --> 00:17:34,997
Mr. Gong.

357
00:17:34,997 --> 00:17:37,866
What? Do you think I can't do it?

358
00:17:39,336 --> 00:17:40,676
I made it very clear.

359
00:17:43,576 --> 00:17:44,606
Ms. Baek.

360
00:17:45,977 --> 00:17:47,076
You have one month.

361
00:17:56,856 --> 00:18:00,396
He must be really angry.

362
00:18:02,767 --> 00:18:04,567
Oh, dear. What should I do?

363
00:18:09,767 --> 00:18:11,166
You should try this too.

364
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:13,737
This product is a best-seller
at our store right now.

365
00:18:17,606 --> 00:18:18,606
Oh, my.

366
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,217
Gosh, this is so nice.

367
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:25,247
By the way, is it okay for me
to try this out like this?

368
00:18:25,616 --> 00:18:26,686
Of course.

369
00:18:26,686 --> 00:18:29,826
This store is mine.
My son opened it up for me.

370
00:18:29,826 --> 00:18:31,326
So don't worry about a thing
and go ahead.

371
00:18:31,326 --> 00:18:33,596
My goodness. Thank you, Ae Kyo.

372
00:18:33,596 --> 00:18:35,866
I got to meet you after a long time,
eat good food,

373
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:37,227
and even take care of my skin.

374
00:18:37,896 --> 00:18:40,197
I'm enjoying such luxuries,
thanks to you.

375
00:18:40,197 --> 00:18:41,567
Luxuries? As if.

376
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:43,666
Of course,
I can do this much for a friend.

377
00:18:45,267 --> 00:18:46,307
Oh, right.

378
00:18:47,136 --> 00:18:49,576
Back when Soo Yeon was
studying abroad in the US,

379
00:18:49,576 --> 00:18:51,047
you were too, weren't you?

380
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:52,146
Yes, I was.

381
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:55,517
Then, you must've met with Soo Yeon
in the US often too.

382
00:18:55,686 --> 00:18:56,947
Gosh. Hey.

383
00:18:56,947 --> 00:18:59,517
The US is a huge country.
How could we meet often?

384
00:19:00,616 --> 00:19:02,356
I ran into her once...

385
00:19:02,356 --> 00:19:03,826
when I was visiting Boston.

386
00:19:04,586 --> 00:19:05,797
Just once?

387
00:19:06,096 --> 00:19:08,297
Yes.
I saw her at a Korean restaurant.

388
00:19:08,497 --> 00:19:10,326
Soo Yeon was there
with her boyfriend.

389
00:19:10,326 --> 00:19:11,626
Oh, right.

390
00:19:11,626 --> 00:19:13,896
Soo Yeon had a boyfriend
when she was studying abroad, right?

391
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:16,037
What was that boyfriend's name?

392
00:19:16,636 --> 00:19:19,176
It was Kang something.
What was it again?

393
00:19:19,807 --> 00:19:22,076
Gosh, why is it so hard
to remember things as I get older?

394
00:19:22,376 --> 00:19:25,947
His last name wasn't Kang.
It was Kim. Kim Sung Soo.

395
00:19:26,076 --> 00:19:28,277
Oh, right. It was Kim Sung Soo.

396
00:19:28,747 --> 00:19:31,287
Oh, my.
You still have a great memory.

397
00:19:31,287 --> 00:19:32,987
It's not my memory that's great.

398
00:19:32,987 --> 00:19:34,886
My brother's name is Kim Sung Soo.

399
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:37,156
I remember it
because it's the same as my brother's.

400
00:19:38,487 --> 00:19:41,527
Soo Yeon's boyfriend was so tall...

401
00:19:41,926 --> 00:19:43,666
and very handsome.

402
00:19:43,997 --> 00:19:46,037
They made such a great pair.

403
00:19:49,737 --> 00:19:50,836
Jae Kyung.

404
00:19:51,136 --> 00:19:53,106
This is a gift to celebrate
our reunion after a long time.

405
00:19:53,106 --> 00:19:54,676
You should take care of your skin
with this from now on.

406
00:19:54,676 --> 00:19:56,507
Oh, my. Even a gift?

407
00:19:57,076 --> 00:19:58,906
Gosh, thank you so much.

408
00:19:59,676 --> 00:20:00,846
Auntie.

409
00:20:04,517 --> 00:20:06,686
Soo Yeon did have a boyfriend
a while ago.

410
00:20:07,757 --> 00:20:08,817
That's right, isn't it?

411
00:20:09,656 --> 00:20:11,287
She did have a boyfriend, right?

412
00:20:11,287 --> 00:20:13,997
Yes. I think they were very close.

413
00:20:14,027 --> 00:20:17,096
Oh, my goodness.
Madam Cho was right.

414
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:20,297
She wasn't just speaking nonsense.

415
00:20:21,997 --> 00:20:23,807
Then, where is that man now?

416
00:20:24,067 --> 00:20:25,707
I don't know that much yet.

417
00:20:25,707 --> 00:20:27,136
But I did find out his name.

418
00:20:27,307 --> 00:20:30,676
The man who dated Soo Yeon
is Kim Sung Soo.

419
00:20:31,076 --> 00:20:32,777
His name is Kim Sung Soo?

420
00:20:33,777 --> 00:20:34,876
Gosh.

421
00:20:35,146 --> 00:20:37,947
You've done a huge thing.

422
00:20:38,217 --> 00:20:41,416
Auntie, I told you to just trust me.

423
00:20:49,967 --> 00:20:52,326
Mother,
you were with Auntie as well.

424
00:20:52,326 --> 00:20:54,297
I only brought one cup of tea.

425
00:20:54,297 --> 00:20:56,267
Shall I bring another?

426
00:20:56,267 --> 00:20:58,507
What? No, I don't need any.

427
00:20:59,836 --> 00:21:01,606
We have something to discuss,

428
00:21:01,606 --> 00:21:03,477
so you can put down the tea here
and leave.

429
00:21:03,807 --> 00:21:04,807
Yes, Auntie.

430
00:21:15,356 --> 00:21:16,487
That feels offensive.

431
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,297
Were they talking about me?

432
00:21:19,297 --> 00:21:21,027
They stopped talking
right as I entered.

433
00:21:21,926 --> 00:21:23,826
What on earth are they plotting?

434
00:21:25,596 --> 00:21:27,596
Right, let's not pay them
any attention.

435
00:21:27,596 --> 00:21:28,997
Let them do whatever they want.

436
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:37,702
Make a heart.

437
00:21:48,783 --> 00:21:51,652
It looks good. Look at you.

438
00:21:51,952 --> 00:21:54,622
- Gosh.
- What? It's Park Do Ra.

439
00:21:54,622 --> 00:21:55,823
I'm not Park Do Ra.

440
00:21:55,823 --> 00:21:56,823
Wait.

441
00:21:57,263 --> 00:21:58,993
But you are Park Do Ra.
I caught you!

442
00:21:59,962 --> 00:22:02,162
Kid. What do you think you're doing?

443
00:22:02,162 --> 00:22:05,632
So, why lie when she is Park Do Ra?
It's annoying.

444
00:22:05,632 --> 00:22:07,472
You shouldn't lie.

445
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,132
Are you two dating?

446
00:22:10,343 --> 00:22:12,243
No way. Are you two a couple?

447
00:22:12,672 --> 00:22:14,372
Hey, no way. Then, did we just...

448
00:22:14,372 --> 00:22:16,172
witness Park Do Ra on a date
in real life?

449
00:22:16,172 --> 00:22:17,182
- Hey, take a photo.
- Kid.

450
00:22:17,182 --> 00:22:18,843
No, you can't take a photo.

451
00:22:18,843 --> 00:22:20,682
I'm her manager.

452
00:22:20,682 --> 00:22:22,982
Since Ms. Park is spending
some personal time,

453
00:22:22,982 --> 00:22:24,083
please be considerate.

454
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:25,583
Kids, please help us out.

455
00:22:26,622 --> 00:22:28,093
I'm sorry I lied.

456
00:22:30,323 --> 00:22:32,962
Have a good time.
Gosh, your uniforms are so pretty.

457
00:22:44,743 --> 00:22:45,803
Drink this.

458
00:22:51,313 --> 00:22:52,513
Sorry, Pil Seung.

459
00:22:54,253 --> 00:22:56,952
You can't even walk down the street
comfortably because of me.

460
00:22:57,553 --> 00:22:59,422
We can't even eat at
popular restaurants.

461
00:23:00,593 --> 00:23:02,593
If you were dating a regular girl,

462
00:23:02,593 --> 00:23:04,593
you wouldn't have to go through
such bothersome situations.

463
00:23:05,763 --> 00:23:08,863
Because of me,
today's date was ruined too.

464
00:23:09,533 --> 00:23:10,702
It wasn't ruined.

465
00:23:11,162 --> 00:23:13,033
We haven't even gotten started
on today's date.

466
00:23:15,702 --> 00:23:17,172
I'm fine with everything.

467
00:23:17,543 --> 00:23:19,803
Just talking to you in the car
is fun for me.

468
00:23:20,372 --> 00:23:22,872
And I like sitting on the grass
and eating a sandwich too.

469
00:23:24,013 --> 00:23:25,083
But...

470
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,682
if you don't like this,

471
00:23:29,753 --> 00:23:31,182
we can go public
with our relationship.

472
00:23:31,882 --> 00:23:33,452
You can do whatever you want.

473
00:23:33,452 --> 00:23:34,892
I'm fine with everything.

474
00:23:37,122 --> 00:23:38,323
What's this?

475
00:23:39,662 --> 00:23:42,392
Hearing you say that is so moving.

476
00:23:42,932 --> 00:23:44,503
You were even moved by that?

477
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:48,333
Things are
already so bothersome now.

478
00:23:49,132 --> 00:23:50,372
If we go public
with our relationship,

479
00:23:50,372 --> 00:23:52,402
you'll have to go through
so much more trouble.

480
00:23:53,343 --> 00:23:54,843
I don't want you to suffer.

481
00:23:56,013 --> 00:23:58,113
Gosh, this time, I'm moved.

482
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:02,053
That must be why
other celebrities...

483
00:24:02,053 --> 00:24:03,882
only go out and about at night...

484
00:24:03,882 --> 00:24:06,482
and only have dates
in their cars or at home.

485
00:24:06,793 --> 00:24:08,722
Because everyone recognizes them
wherever they go.

486
00:24:10,863 --> 00:24:12,722
Still, we can't be like that.

487
00:24:14,093 --> 00:24:15,162
Do Ra.

488
00:24:15,593 --> 00:24:17,333
We can come up with
a new kind of date.

489
00:24:18,103 --> 00:24:19,232
According to our own style.

490
00:24:20,632 --> 00:24:21,833
According to our own style?

491
00:24:32,343 --> 00:24:33,482
Where are we going?

492
00:24:35,013 --> 00:24:36,452
Where are we going?

493
00:24:36,922 --> 00:24:38,422
(Oriental Roast Chicken)

494
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,823
(Mushroom, Apple)

495
00:25:25,402 --> 00:25:27,372
Goodness.

496
00:25:27,573 --> 00:25:31,003
You two are
a great looking married couple.

497
00:25:31,672 --> 00:25:32,773
Thank you.

498
00:25:34,313 --> 00:25:37,912
Which town are you two from?

499
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:40,853
We're from the town over there.

500
00:25:40,853 --> 00:25:41,853
What about you, Grandma?

501
00:25:41,853 --> 00:25:44,152
I'm from the town over here.

502
00:25:45,023 --> 00:25:48,823
Gosh, I'm so hungry after smelling
that anchovy broth from the noodles.

503
00:25:49,353 --> 00:25:50,422
What about you, honey?

504
00:25:51,763 --> 00:25:53,563
I'm hungry too.

505
00:25:54,063 --> 00:25:57,063
Grandma, make us two bowls
of steaming noodles,

506
00:25:57,063 --> 00:25:58,662
and give us a nice serving
of sundae too.

507
00:25:58,662 --> 00:26:01,033
All right. Sit tight.

508
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:03,372
What was that?

509
00:26:04,902 --> 00:26:06,642
Drink your water. It's hot.

510
00:26:07,412 --> 00:26:08,442
All right.

511
00:26:11,313 --> 00:26:13,283
Thank you for the food.

512
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:28,363
By the way,
how many kids do you have?

513
00:26:30,303 --> 00:26:31,702
We have three boys.

514
00:26:31,803 --> 00:26:32,962
Goodness.

515
00:26:32,962 --> 00:26:36,003
You young folks have three sons?

516
00:26:36,402 --> 00:26:39,003
You're such patriots.

517
00:26:39,003 --> 00:26:42,513
The government should give
awards to people like you.

518
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:46,382
Why? Do you want me to feed you?

519
00:26:46,882 --> 00:26:47,882
Here.

520
00:26:49,382 --> 00:26:50,523
Open up.

521
00:26:51,283 --> 00:26:55,093
Your husband is feeding you.
Go ahead and eat it.

522
00:26:55,993 --> 00:26:57,093
Okay.

523
00:27:01,493 --> 00:27:04,033
Hey. Come on.

524
00:27:04,033 --> 00:27:07,273
- This one. Come on.
- What?

525
00:27:07,273 --> 00:27:08,773
Right? That.

526
00:27:08,773 --> 00:27:09,932
Right.

527
00:27:10,902 --> 00:27:12,003
Got it.

528
00:27:13,142 --> 00:27:15,043
You open up as well, honey.

529
00:27:15,412 --> 00:27:16,743
Here.

530
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:22,152
Look at how much in love you are.

531
00:27:22,382 --> 00:27:24,323
No wonder you have three children.

532
00:27:27,952 --> 00:27:29,553
So when will we welcome a daughter?

533
00:27:29,593 --> 00:27:30,622
What?

534
00:27:31,222 --> 00:27:32,563
Pil Seung!

535
00:27:35,132 --> 00:27:37,563
Maybe you should be the actor.

536
00:27:37,563 --> 00:27:38,833
How are you this good at it?

537
00:27:39,103 --> 00:27:41,503
Do you know what I first did
after becoming a director?

538
00:27:41,503 --> 00:27:42,972
- What is it?
- I died.

539
00:27:43,073 --> 00:27:44,103
What?

540
00:27:44,303 --> 00:27:45,942
I got to work on a period drama,

541
00:27:45,942 --> 00:27:47,172
and one of the extras...

542
00:27:47,172 --> 00:27:48,372
couldn't play his role
due to a stomachache.

543
00:27:48,372 --> 00:27:50,882
I took his place
and died after taking an arrow.

544
00:27:50,942 --> 00:27:52,513
It only took me one take.

545
00:27:52,513 --> 00:27:53,853
Really?

546
00:27:53,982 --> 00:27:57,253
People kept telling me
to debut as an actor.

547
00:27:57,382 --> 00:27:58,853
If I had done that,

548
00:27:59,283 --> 00:28:01,192
I would've become
the nation's sweetheart.

549
00:28:02,093 --> 00:28:04,493
Did my simple compliment
take you all the way there?

550
00:28:04,793 --> 00:28:06,692
You're impossible.

551
00:28:06,922 --> 00:28:08,732
Do Ra, it's true!

552
00:28:24,813 --> 00:28:26,013
Sun Young.

553
00:28:26,982 --> 00:28:28,152
I have...

554
00:28:29,152 --> 00:28:31,382
no regrets at all.

555
00:28:32,283 --> 00:28:34,392
I don't resent anyone.

556
00:28:35,692 --> 00:28:36,922
So...

557
00:28:37,523 --> 00:28:40,063
don't blame that woman.

558
00:28:40,993 --> 00:28:42,132
And...

559
00:28:43,132 --> 00:28:45,863
don't let her pay you back.

560
00:28:59,243 --> 00:29:03,882
(My friend Soo Yeon)

561
00:29:07,053 --> 00:29:08,122
Sun Young?

562
00:29:12,162 --> 00:29:14,192
What is it? What's wrong?

563
00:29:18,662 --> 00:29:19,732
Soo Yeon...

564
00:29:26,702 --> 00:29:28,172
Sun Young, I'm glad you came to me.

565
00:29:29,843 --> 00:29:31,412
I'll give you the 50,000 dollars.

566
00:29:32,412 --> 00:29:34,513
Give it back to her this second.

567
00:29:37,722 --> 00:29:39,122
I didn't want...

568
00:29:40,553 --> 00:29:43,652
to inconvenience you
with something like this and I'm sorry.

569
00:29:44,093 --> 00:29:46,593
Why would you say that
when we're more than just friends?

570
00:29:49,232 --> 00:29:51,632
I wired you the money.
Check your account.

571
00:29:59,573 --> 00:30:00,712
Thanks.

572
00:30:02,243 --> 00:30:05,182
I promise to pay back the money.

573
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:07,753
Sure.

574
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,982
Take your time
and do so when you can.

575
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:16,593
I wanted to come up
with the money myself,

576
00:30:18,523 --> 00:30:21,132
but I can't take out
any more bank loans.

577
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,462
You see,

578
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:27,902
Pil Seung's dad...

579
00:30:28,972 --> 00:30:30,402
took out a loan
of 300,000 dollars...

580
00:30:30,402 --> 00:30:32,543
to start a business that flopped,

581
00:30:34,513 --> 00:30:36,912
and Pil Seung
has been paying it back.

582
00:30:37,912 --> 00:30:40,513
What? Pil Seung's been doing that?

583
00:30:42,652 --> 00:30:43,922
Yes, that's why...

584
00:30:45,053 --> 00:30:46,982
I couldn't tell him about this.

585
00:30:48,793 --> 00:30:50,763
I was worried...

586
00:30:51,323 --> 00:30:53,993
that he would try
to take out a loan from someone.

587
00:31:00,132 --> 00:31:01,773
I'm glad you came to me.

588
00:31:04,472 --> 00:31:06,702
Pil Seung only just started
to build his career,

589
00:31:06,702 --> 00:31:09,513
and he shouldn't be carrying
a burden this heavy.

590
00:31:12,243 --> 00:31:13,853
You did the right thing
by coming to me.

591
00:31:14,982 --> 00:31:18,853
If anything like this happens again,
let me be the first one you come to.

592
00:31:19,422 --> 00:31:20,482
Got it?

593
00:31:24,422 --> 00:31:25,892
Your words alone...

594
00:31:28,662 --> 00:31:30,162
are a huge comfort.

595
00:32:25,482 --> 00:32:27,952
Pil Seung just started
to build a career,

596
00:32:30,023 --> 00:32:33,392
but he has been paying back
a loan of 300,000 dollars.

597
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:38,033
My poor Pil Seung.

598
00:32:41,103 --> 00:32:43,872
Do Ra has been offered
a pile of ad campaigns,

599
00:32:43,872 --> 00:32:45,972
so which one
should she accept first?

600
00:32:46,642 --> 00:32:48,412
Once she takes on all of these,

601
00:32:48,412 --> 00:32:50,273
I won't have to worry about my debt.

602
00:32:50,783 --> 00:32:52,382
Finally, I'll be able
to sleep peacefully.

603
00:32:53,283 --> 00:32:54,353
Come in.

604
00:32:56,813 --> 00:32:59,422
Ms. Baek, Kim Sun Young
is here to see you.

605
00:32:59,952 --> 00:33:01,622
Kim Sun Young? Who's that?

606
00:33:05,593 --> 00:33:06,622
That would be me.

607
00:33:07,662 --> 00:33:08,692
You may leave us.

608
00:33:09,162 --> 00:33:11,232
- We don't need any tea.
- Sure, Ms. Baek.

609
00:33:13,662 --> 00:33:15,033
What brings you by?

610
00:33:19,402 --> 00:33:21,412
I came by
to give back the 50,000 dollars.

611
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:25,313
There's no reason for us
to accept this money.

612
00:33:26,182 --> 00:33:27,952
My father gave it to you,

613
00:33:28,313 --> 00:33:29,753
so have at it.

614
00:33:30,013 --> 00:33:32,952
Look here. What are you scheming
by bringing back the money?

615
00:33:34,452 --> 00:33:36,553
Didn't you once beg
for me to give it back?

616
00:33:37,593 --> 00:33:39,063
Isn't it enough?

617
00:33:39,323 --> 00:33:43,063
That old bat first mentioned
a total of 100,000 dollars.

618
00:33:43,462 --> 00:33:45,063
Are you telling me to pay up?

619
00:33:45,063 --> 00:33:47,472
Seriously. In your dreams.

620
00:33:47,472 --> 00:33:49,202
Threatening to go public
with my debt...

621
00:33:52,872 --> 00:33:54,412
Let me ask you one thing.

622
00:33:55,642 --> 00:33:58,743
Aren't you at all guilty
about what you did to my father?

623
00:33:59,013 --> 00:34:00,083
Unbelievable.

624
00:34:00,182 --> 00:34:02,553
Why should I feel guilty
regarding your father?

625
00:34:02,553 --> 00:34:05,722
You've got to be kidding me.

626
00:34:07,823 --> 00:34:10,222
My father's feelings for you
were genuine.

627
00:34:11,122 --> 00:34:13,122
While not knowing
what kind of trash you are,

628
00:34:14,293 --> 00:34:15,993
he told me to forgive you...

629
00:34:17,292 --> 00:34:18,803
as he was dying...

630
00:34:19,902 --> 00:34:21,803
and said I shouldn't let you
pay me back.

631
00:34:23,132 --> 00:34:24,873
And you call yourself a human being?

632
00:34:25,902 --> 00:34:27,712
How can you live with yourself?

633
00:34:28,613 --> 00:34:32,082
How could you not feel guilty
regarding my father?

634
00:34:32,082 --> 00:34:33,482
Tell me, then.

635
00:34:35,252 --> 00:34:36,953
Why should I feel guilty?

636
00:34:36,953 --> 00:34:39,652
That smelly old man
went crazy over a younger woman.

637
00:34:39,652 --> 00:34:42,292
He gave me money to win me over,
so why should I feel guilty?

638
00:34:42,553 --> 00:34:44,692
An old man who didn't know his place
gave money to a younger woman...

639
00:34:44,692 --> 00:34:46,663
to get in her pants,

640
00:34:46,663 --> 00:34:48,332
so why should I feel guilty?

641
00:34:48,632 --> 00:34:49,993
You witch!

642
00:34:50,493 --> 00:34:52,303
You're a monster!

643
00:34:53,033 --> 00:34:54,102
How dare you say that...

644
00:34:54,102 --> 00:34:56,132
after taking advantage
of someone's feelings?

645
00:34:56,902 --> 00:34:58,303
How can you live with yourself?

646
00:34:58,602 --> 00:35:01,442
My father died because of you.

647
00:35:01,442 --> 00:35:03,013
Bring back my father!

648
00:35:03,013 --> 00:35:04,783
Bring back my father, you witch!

649
00:35:04,783 --> 00:35:06,743
- My dad...
- Get her off me.

650
00:35:09,712 --> 00:35:10,982
Drag her out of here.

651
00:35:11,053 --> 00:35:13,223
I'd rather call the cops on you,

652
00:35:13,382 --> 00:35:15,593
but I won't for Do Ra's sake.

653
00:35:15,593 --> 00:35:17,292
Don't just stand there
and get rid of her!

654
00:35:17,422 --> 00:35:18,623
Let go!

655
00:35:19,462 --> 00:35:21,093
I'll walk out myself.

656
00:35:23,962 --> 00:35:26,002
Baek Mi Ja, you listen to me.

657
00:35:27,363 --> 00:35:29,373
You may not want to admit to it,

658
00:35:29,873 --> 00:35:32,073
but you know what you did wrong.

659
00:35:33,002 --> 00:35:34,413
And karma...

660
00:35:35,013 --> 00:35:37,513
will have you pay for it in spades.

661
00:35:38,212 --> 00:35:39,413
Remember that.

662
00:35:44,152 --> 00:35:45,283
How dare she...

663
00:35:45,882 --> 00:35:48,453
How dare she curse me
with such words?

664
00:35:48,453 --> 00:35:50,292
(CEO Baek Mi Ja)

665
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:38,143
- Mom.
- Yes?

666
00:36:38,143 --> 00:36:39,573
I enjoyed my breakfast.

667
00:36:40,672 --> 00:36:42,913
As if toast and coffee
counts as breakfast.

668
00:36:43,812 --> 00:36:45,382
Hurry off to work already.

669
00:36:45,643 --> 00:36:46,643
Sure.

670
00:36:48,413 --> 00:36:51,082
Mom, are you free this afternoon?

671
00:36:52,323 --> 00:36:54,993
This afternoon? Why? What for?

672
00:36:56,252 --> 00:36:59,223
Why else? It's been a while
since we went on a date.

673
00:37:02,493 --> 00:37:04,832
You're busy enough
without having to fuss over me.

674
00:37:05,703 --> 00:37:07,263
Maybe some other time.

675
00:37:07,672 --> 00:37:09,473
But I appreciate you
looking out for me.

676
00:37:10,703 --> 00:37:12,873
I was busy filming
"Straightforward Romance"...

677
00:37:12,873 --> 00:37:14,373
and couldn't look after you.

678
00:37:14,573 --> 00:37:17,042
Also, it's been a while
since we went on a date.

679
00:37:17,373 --> 00:37:19,683
You're right. It's been a while.

680
00:37:20,013 --> 00:37:21,582
So meet me for lunch today.

681
00:37:23,013 --> 00:37:24,882
But don't tell Dad or Grandma.

682
00:37:25,783 --> 00:37:26,783
Sure.

683
00:37:26,783 --> 00:37:29,352
I should meet up with my son
since he's offering.

684
00:37:29,852 --> 00:37:31,062
I'm off to work.

685
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:33,163
You're heading out?

686
00:37:37,192 --> 00:37:38,363
I'm heading out!

687
00:37:38,363 --> 00:37:40,163
Sure. Have a good day at work.

688
00:37:40,433 --> 00:37:42,303
Watch out for cars and women.

689
00:37:44,243 --> 00:37:45,873
Hyun Chul.

690
00:37:45,873 --> 00:37:47,973
Doesn't it seem like Sun Young
is in a better mood?

691
00:37:47,973 --> 00:37:50,613
She sounds less angry
and is frowning less.

692
00:37:50,772 --> 00:37:52,013
Come on.

693
00:37:52,442 --> 00:37:54,752
She's only that nice to Pil Seung.

694
00:37:55,013 --> 00:37:57,582
She's still avoiding
and ignoring me.

695
00:37:58,283 --> 00:37:59,783
- Still?
- Yes.

696
00:38:00,623 --> 00:38:02,652
I've been walking
on eggshells around her...

697
00:38:03,123 --> 00:38:05,823
to the point
where I slept crouched by the door.

698
00:38:06,462 --> 00:38:08,232
You slept by the door?

699
00:38:09,993 --> 00:38:11,602
This is upsetting.

700
00:38:11,832 --> 00:38:13,832
Mom, still...

701
00:38:13,832 --> 00:38:17,502
I honestly thought she might
throw pillows at me or something...

702
00:38:17,502 --> 00:38:19,172
telling me to leave the house.

703
00:38:19,373 --> 00:38:23,013
It's a relief
that she lets me sleep by the door.

704
00:38:23,013 --> 00:38:25,243
A relief, my foot.

705
00:38:26,582 --> 00:38:28,582
I understand the situation we're in,

706
00:38:28,582 --> 00:38:30,553
but you're not a sock
that has lost its pair.

707
00:38:31,422 --> 00:38:34,053
She can be too cruel at times.

708
00:38:36,692 --> 00:38:40,623
Until when must we
walk on eggshells around her?

709
00:38:41,033 --> 00:38:43,763
Mom, how can you even say that?

710
00:38:43,763 --> 00:38:45,863
Just like Hyun Chul said,
be glad she didn't kick you out.

711
00:38:46,732 --> 00:38:49,703
For the time being,
watch what you say.

712
00:38:50,132 --> 00:38:53,402
You and Hyun Chul don't have
the right to say anything.

713
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:57,172
That brat... Unbelievable.

714
00:39:04,752 --> 00:39:07,953
Hey, honey. I'm off to work...

715
00:39:07,953 --> 00:39:09,893
and I just told my mom.

716
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:11,462
Have breakfast before you go.

717
00:39:11,763 --> 00:39:14,292
No, it's okay.
As if I have the right to eat.

718
00:39:14,663 --> 00:39:16,292
I'll get going.

719
00:39:16,993 --> 00:39:19,433
Who will have to pick up the pieces
if you exhaust yourself...

720
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,573
while working on an empty stomach?

721
00:39:22,772 --> 00:39:23,973
I packed you some lunch,

722
00:39:23,973 --> 00:39:25,743
so eat your breakfast
and take it with you.

723
00:39:27,542 --> 00:39:30,243
All right. I'll do just that.

724
00:39:46,518 --> 00:39:47,918
He's not coming by today.

725
00:39:50,173 --> 00:39:51,274
Of course.

726
00:39:51,774 --> 00:39:54,113
Why would he be here
when I almost bit his head off?

727
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:09,363
Well, I...

728
00:40:11,064 --> 00:40:13,204
One cappuccino, please.

729
00:40:15,533 --> 00:40:16,673
Don't.

730
00:40:17,704 --> 00:40:19,173
It'll be on me today.

731
00:40:19,744 --> 00:40:21,343
You're buying me coffee?

732
00:40:23,814 --> 00:40:25,914
I inconvenienced you the other day,

733
00:40:27,244 --> 00:40:28,684
so I should make up for that.

734
00:40:29,954 --> 00:40:32,684
Right. If you say so.

735
00:40:46,564 --> 00:40:47,564
Thanks.

736
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:53,073
Thanks for the other day.

737
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,573
There's no need to thank me.

738
00:40:54,573 --> 00:40:57,573
You're not a stranger,
so of course I should help.

739
00:40:59,044 --> 00:41:01,314
Thanks for the coffee.
I'll enjoy it.

740
00:41:06,883 --> 00:41:08,894
I appreciate
what you did for me that day,

741
00:41:11,024 --> 00:41:13,394
and I no longer resent you.

742
00:41:14,894 --> 00:41:16,664
But if I'm being honest,

743
00:41:17,763 --> 00:41:21,434
I don't want to run into you
even if it is by chance.

744
00:41:23,903 --> 00:41:25,604
We don't share a pleasant history.

745
00:41:29,843 --> 00:41:31,474
So I ask you respectfully...

746
00:41:32,414 --> 00:41:34,213
not to come here again.

747
00:41:40,423 --> 00:41:41,624
What...

748
00:41:42,394 --> 00:41:45,724
Sure thing. I can see that
you're doing well,

749
00:41:45,863 --> 00:41:47,463
so I'll leave
after having my coffee.

750
00:42:26,934 --> 00:42:28,463
Over here!

751
00:42:29,403 --> 00:42:31,673
Gosh, I'm sorry. No!

752
00:42:36,843 --> 00:42:38,613
I had a blast today.

753
00:42:40,483 --> 00:42:43,783
It's sad to know that you're already
heading back to the US.

754
00:42:43,854 --> 00:42:45,013
Won't we get to hang out again?

755
00:42:45,013 --> 00:42:47,823
I'll call you
the next time I'm in Korea.

756
00:42:47,823 --> 00:42:49,053
We'll hang out again, Ms. Ma Ri.

757
00:42:49,053 --> 00:42:50,894
You should mean that. Promise me.

758
00:42:51,724 --> 00:42:52,724
I promise.

759
00:42:53,064 --> 00:42:56,033
And hang out with me
when I hit you up while in the US.

760
00:42:56,394 --> 00:42:57,794
Of course.

761
00:42:58,233 --> 00:42:59,834
Also, this is for you.

762
00:42:59,834 --> 00:43:02,334
You seemed to like dolls,
so I got this for you.

763
00:43:03,774 --> 00:43:06,004
This is my absolute favorite!

764
00:43:06,274 --> 00:43:08,774
I see we have the same taste.

765
00:43:09,113 --> 00:43:11,474
I'm sure we can be good friends.

766
00:43:13,814 --> 00:43:16,553
Also, stop calling me Ms. Ma Ri.

767
00:43:17,584 --> 00:43:19,423
In the US, we get to be friends
regardless of our age.

768
00:43:21,624 --> 00:43:23,794
Let's be friends starting today.

769
00:43:24,394 --> 00:43:25,394
What do you say?

770
00:43:26,394 --> 00:43:27,593
Sure. I'd love that.

771
00:43:41,173 --> 00:43:44,443
Ma Ri, my gosh. What is all this?

772
00:43:44,443 --> 00:43:46,184
- Did you buy it?
- No.

773
00:43:46,184 --> 00:43:47,843
Park Do Jun gave it to me
as a parting gift...

774
00:43:47,843 --> 00:43:49,513
since he's going back to the US.

775
00:43:49,513 --> 00:43:51,053
Isn't it adorable?

776
00:43:51,783 --> 00:43:54,954
Also, Do Jun and I
agreed to be friends.

777
00:43:55,754 --> 00:43:57,294
Ma Ri, you must be thrilled...

778
00:43:57,294 --> 00:44:00,124
to have gotten a pretty gift
and to have gained a friend.

779
00:44:00,124 --> 00:44:03,664
Yes. Mom, Do Jun is the sweetest.

780
00:44:03,934 --> 00:44:06,533
He doesn't see me differently...

781
00:44:06,934 --> 00:44:08,334
and treats me as a friend.

782
00:44:10,533 --> 00:44:13,274
What is it?
Would you like to go home and rest?

783
00:44:13,744 --> 00:44:17,244
Got it. Then...

784
00:44:17,244 --> 00:44:18,244
Right here.

785
00:44:18,244 --> 00:44:20,613
- Good night.
- Good night, my friend.

786
00:44:20,744 --> 00:44:22,454
Do Ra, I'm at the airport.

787
00:44:22,454 --> 00:44:23,754
My plane leaves in two hours.

788
00:44:23,754 --> 00:44:25,053
Oh, no.

789
00:44:25,053 --> 00:44:27,354
I was too busy to hang out with you.

790
00:44:27,954 --> 00:44:29,593
I'll see you
during summer break, then.

791
00:44:29,593 --> 00:44:30,593
Sure thing.

792
00:44:30,593 --> 00:44:32,564
Don't work
at the expense of your health...

793
00:44:32,564 --> 00:44:33,863
and stop worrying about me.

794
00:44:34,224 --> 00:44:35,323
Go, Do Ra.

795
00:44:38,463 --> 00:44:41,204
The food here is delicious.
It melts in my mouth.

796
00:44:43,474 --> 00:44:46,173
But isn't the food
a bit too expensive?

797
00:44:46,774 --> 00:44:47,774
Mom,

798
00:44:48,244 --> 00:44:51,213
don't worry about the money
and enjoy what I'm treating you to.

799
00:44:51,974 --> 00:44:54,783
Sure thing.
Since you're treating me to this,

800
00:44:54,783 --> 00:44:56,954
I'm going to have my fill
and enjoy it.

801
00:45:00,983 --> 00:45:02,124
Mom,

802
00:45:02,994 --> 00:45:04,394
something's going on at home, right?

803
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:06,593
What?

804
00:45:08,463 --> 00:45:10,093
Gosh, no. Don't be ridiculous.

805
00:45:10,894 --> 00:45:13,633
Things are icy cold at the house
when I get home after work...

806
00:45:13,903 --> 00:45:15,573
and no one is telling me a thing.

807
00:45:16,073 --> 00:45:17,733
I'm not that dense, you know.

808
00:45:19,573 --> 00:45:21,104
Mom, is it Dad?

809
00:45:21,874 --> 00:45:23,713
Did something happen with Dad?

810
00:45:25,544 --> 00:45:27,613
I already said nothing was going on.

811
00:45:28,044 --> 00:45:31,613
We're not telling you anything
because nothing's going on.

812
00:45:34,124 --> 00:45:35,354
Then, I'm glad.

813
00:45:36,754 --> 00:45:37,923
But Mom,

814
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:40,763
if anything happens,

815
00:45:40,763 --> 00:45:44,193
tell me about it rather than
trying to solve it yourself.

816
00:45:45,064 --> 00:45:47,064
I'm the only son in the family,

817
00:45:47,064 --> 00:45:48,564
so I should be the first to know.

818
00:45:51,073 --> 00:45:52,173
All right.

819
00:45:53,673 --> 00:45:56,044
I get it, so eat up.

820
00:45:57,943 --> 00:45:59,943
The food here is incredible.

821
00:46:00,184 --> 00:46:02,213
It must taste even better
because I'm enjoying it with you.

822
00:46:02,283 --> 00:46:04,383
I guess you're right about that.

823
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:07,483
- Don't give it all to me.
- Okay.

824
00:46:08,354 --> 00:46:11,494
What rotten luck.
What is she doing here?

825
00:46:11,494 --> 00:46:12,963
It's the room further inside.

826
00:46:13,093 --> 00:46:14,863
- Let's go, Ms. Baek.
- Okay.

827
00:46:15,794 --> 00:46:18,033
Mom, this is non-alcoholic.

828
00:46:18,794 --> 00:46:21,533
Is it really? Shall I drink, then?

829
00:46:21,664 --> 00:46:22,834
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

830
00:46:22,834 --> 00:46:25,803
He called her "Mom."
Is he Dae Chung?

831
00:46:25,803 --> 00:46:26,843
Gosh.

832
00:46:27,104 --> 00:46:29,374
- I'd never recognize him.
- It's delicious.

833
00:46:29,374 --> 00:46:30,374
- Is it good?
- Yes.

834
00:46:30,644 --> 00:46:31,943
I'll order you more, then.

835
00:46:42,153 --> 00:46:43,224
Who's this?

836
00:46:47,423 --> 00:46:48,664
Hello?

837
00:46:48,963 --> 00:46:51,564
You're Soo Yeon, right?

838
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:54,533
It's Kang Eun Ju.

839
00:46:54,533 --> 00:46:56,173
Hey, Eun Ju.

840
00:46:56,633 --> 00:46:58,673
How long has it been?

841
00:46:59,044 --> 00:47:00,744
It has been years, hasn't it?

842
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:03,544
Yes, it has.

843
00:47:03,914 --> 00:47:06,443
How did time pass by so fast?

844
00:47:07,044 --> 00:47:08,843
How are you doing?

845
00:47:09,283 --> 00:47:11,213
I'm doing okay.

846
00:47:11,553 --> 00:47:13,653
What about you? Are you well?

847
00:47:14,323 --> 00:47:15,994
Yes, I am.

848
00:47:16,224 --> 00:47:20,193
You know, Soo Yeon,
something has been bothering me,

849
00:47:20,193 --> 00:47:21,664
so I decided to call.

850
00:47:22,193 --> 00:47:24,494
What do you mean?

851
00:47:24,494 --> 00:47:26,233
What's bothering you?

852
00:47:30,874 --> 00:47:32,443
What?

853
00:47:33,573 --> 00:47:34,644
Ae Kyo?

854
00:47:36,244 --> 00:47:39,713
Why does Auntie want to find...

855
00:47:39,713 --> 00:47:42,343
Soo Yeon's
old boyfriend Kim Sung Soo?

856
00:47:43,383 --> 00:47:45,754
It has to be about Soo Yeon.

857
00:47:45,954 --> 00:47:48,254
Auntie's like that
because there's an even more...

858
00:47:48,254 --> 00:47:49,423
shocking secret.

859
00:47:49,994 --> 00:47:51,794
What could it be?

860
00:47:52,624 --> 00:47:55,934
What is it? I'm dead curious.

861
00:47:56,664 --> 00:47:58,593
- Hong Ae Kyo!
- My goodness.

862
00:47:59,403 --> 00:48:03,474
Can't you act with more class?

863
00:48:03,533 --> 00:48:05,403
And how dare you call...

864
00:48:05,403 --> 00:48:07,403
your mother-in-law by her full name?

865
00:48:08,704 --> 00:48:10,274
You called Eun Ju...

866
00:48:10,443 --> 00:48:11,713
and met Jae Kyung, didn't you?

867
00:48:12,644 --> 00:48:13,744
What's going on?

868
00:48:14,283 --> 00:48:16,914
Why did you go around
digging into my past?

869
00:48:17,814 --> 00:48:20,524
I studied abroad over 30 years ago.

870
00:48:20,524 --> 00:48:22,923
Who I dated and what I did then.

871
00:48:23,153 --> 00:48:25,354
Why are you so curious about that?

872
00:48:25,354 --> 00:48:26,693
Well...

873
00:48:26,693 --> 00:48:29,434
I was just... I mean...

874
00:48:30,233 --> 00:48:31,733
As your mother-in-law,

875
00:48:32,093 --> 00:48:35,504
though you're my friend,
you're also my daughter-in-law,

876
00:48:36,504 --> 00:48:39,403
and I wanted to know how things were
when you were abroad.

877
00:48:40,504 --> 00:48:42,374
Do you think
that's a decent explanation?

878
00:48:42,843 --> 00:48:46,713
We're family
and we live under the same roof.

879
00:48:47,013 --> 00:48:48,644
How could you do this in secret?

880
00:48:49,584 --> 00:48:51,954
What's your intention?

881
00:48:52,113 --> 00:48:53,883
What are you up to?

882
00:48:53,883 --> 00:48:55,584
I'm not up to anything.

883
00:48:55,653 --> 00:48:57,354
I don't have an intention.

884
00:48:57,354 --> 00:48:59,963
I really don't, not one bit.

885
00:49:00,064 --> 00:49:03,033
I just missed our old friends,

886
00:49:03,033 --> 00:49:05,763
so I made some calls
and met to chat with them.

887
00:49:05,763 --> 00:49:08,533
We talked about stuff
and you came up,

888
00:49:08,533 --> 00:49:09,903
and that's it.

889
00:49:11,204 --> 00:49:12,233
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

890
00:49:13,403 --> 00:49:14,443
Hey.

891
00:49:15,704 --> 00:49:16,814
What's going on?

892
00:49:18,374 --> 00:49:19,414
What's happening?

893
00:49:19,914 --> 00:49:21,744
Well...

894
00:49:26,553 --> 00:49:28,323
What was that about?

895
00:49:30,724 --> 00:49:31,823
What is it?

896
00:49:33,963 --> 00:49:35,794
It's nothing.

897
00:49:36,763 --> 00:49:39,633
She met with some old friends
and talked nonsense,

898
00:49:39,733 --> 00:49:40,803
so I gave her a warning.

899
00:49:41,504 --> 00:49:42,633
Ae Kyo...

900
00:49:44,434 --> 00:49:48,173
I mean, Mother always had a problem
when it came to figuring out...

901
00:49:48,474 --> 00:49:50,144
what not to say to people.

902
00:49:50,443 --> 00:49:51,713
Try to understand.

903
00:49:53,383 --> 00:49:55,613
I'll go and get some water.

904
00:50:04,224 --> 00:50:06,593
Why would she dig into my past?

905
00:50:08,193 --> 00:50:09,633
Does she know something?

906
00:50:12,334 --> 00:50:13,334
No.

907
00:50:14,533 --> 00:50:15,763
It can't be that.

908
00:50:17,033 --> 00:50:19,604
No one knows about Pil Seung.

909
00:50:21,644 --> 00:50:23,113
Only my dead mom.

910
00:50:25,374 --> 00:50:28,244
No. It won't be that.

911
00:50:31,983 --> 00:50:33,024
What?

912
00:50:33,754 --> 00:50:35,283
She found out...

913
00:50:35,524 --> 00:50:38,254
you asked your old friends
about her past?

914
00:50:38,823 --> 00:50:39,863
Yes.

915
00:50:41,564 --> 00:50:43,434
You should be more careful now.

916
00:50:44,394 --> 00:50:47,903
She'll hide her secrets even more.

917
00:50:48,633 --> 00:50:49,934
I smell something fishy.

918
00:50:50,403 --> 00:50:52,704
Chairman Gong
asked what it was about,

919
00:50:52,843 --> 00:50:54,943
but she said it was nothing at all,

920
00:50:54,943 --> 00:50:56,213
and left with him.

921
00:50:56,213 --> 00:50:57,974
That means she's hiding something.

922
00:50:58,314 --> 00:51:00,113
Poor Jin Taek.

923
00:51:00,783 --> 00:51:03,814
He'll believe anything
his wife says,

924
00:51:03,814 --> 00:51:06,283
not knowing
she's a vixen with extra tails.

925
00:51:07,283 --> 00:51:09,653
Auntie, you might as well tell me...

926
00:51:10,053 --> 00:51:13,593
why you wanted me
to look into Soo Yeon's past.

927
00:51:14,394 --> 00:51:16,233
Why are you looking for...

928
00:51:16,233 --> 00:51:18,733
her old boyfriend Kim Sung Soo?

929
00:51:19,633 --> 00:51:20,863
It's not the time.

930
00:51:21,763 --> 00:51:24,303
I'll tell you first when it is.

931
00:51:40,283 --> 00:51:41,883
I'm home.

932
00:51:42,184 --> 00:51:43,254
Hi, Mom.

933
00:51:44,153 --> 00:51:47,994
Did you have a good day,
Ms. Park the actress?

934
00:51:48,363 --> 00:51:51,363
Who sent these, Mom? They're lovely.

935
00:51:51,794 --> 00:51:54,004
Mr. Gong sent them.

936
00:51:54,004 --> 00:51:56,803
With a bottle
of the nicest champagne.

937
00:51:57,073 --> 00:52:00,443
Mom.
You can't accept things from him.

938
00:52:00,644 --> 00:52:01,774
Send them back.

939
00:52:02,044 --> 00:52:05,644
And don't even accept
a grain of rice from now on.

940
00:52:05,644 --> 00:52:08,713
Do Ra, take a look at this.

941
00:52:09,653 --> 00:52:12,454
He apologized for acting rashly...

942
00:52:12,553 --> 00:52:14,883
at the drama's wrap party.

943
00:52:14,883 --> 00:52:16,454
He wrote you a card.

944
00:52:16,854 --> 00:52:18,624
And look at this too.

945
00:52:19,463 --> 00:52:21,593
See this?

946
00:52:22,224 --> 00:52:25,093
Cha Bong Soo posted this
on his social media.

947
00:52:25,263 --> 00:52:27,564
It looks like the two made up.

948
00:52:27,564 --> 00:52:30,903
They took a photo with their hands
on each other's shoulders.

949
00:52:31,504 --> 00:52:32,673
So what?

950
00:52:33,144 --> 00:52:35,544
It's only right to apologize
if you made a mistake.

951
00:52:36,443 --> 00:52:39,783
Do Ra. Nice guys like him
are hard to find.

952
00:52:39,783 --> 00:52:41,013
The heir to a massive company...

953
00:52:41,013 --> 00:52:43,084
bowed and apologized to an actor.

954
00:52:43,084 --> 00:52:44,653
That shows character.

955
00:52:44,653 --> 00:52:46,823
It takes lots of courage.

956
00:52:46,823 --> 00:52:48,923
I saw Mr. Gong in a different light.

957
00:52:48,923 --> 00:52:51,754
Think about him with an open mind.

958
00:52:51,754 --> 00:52:54,564
Don't rush it. Take your time.

959
00:52:54,564 --> 00:52:57,894
Mom. Don't mention Mr. Gong again.

960
00:52:57,934 --> 00:52:59,193
I really hate him.

961
00:52:59,863 --> 00:53:03,334
Why do you actually hate him?

962
00:53:03,903 --> 00:53:06,673
Such a perfect man
only appears on TV.

963
00:53:07,044 --> 00:53:09,414
Why would you hate such a great guy?

964
00:53:09,613 --> 00:53:11,213
What's wrong with you?

965
00:53:11,213 --> 00:53:12,843
How is he a great guy?

966
00:53:13,314 --> 00:53:15,213
You seem to like
everything about him...

967
00:53:15,213 --> 00:53:16,954
because he's a rich heir,

968
00:53:16,954 --> 00:53:18,283
but not me.

969
00:53:18,513 --> 00:53:20,653
Does he think
he's a king or a deity?

970
00:53:21,024 --> 00:53:22,684
He's arrogant and self-centered.

971
00:53:23,354 --> 00:53:25,423
That's because he's special.

972
00:53:25,423 --> 00:53:27,024
How is that a problem?

973
00:53:27,093 --> 00:53:30,233
Give him a chance.
Have an open mind.

974
00:53:30,263 --> 00:53:33,903
He shows you so much attention.
How pure and sweet is that?

975
00:53:34,204 --> 00:53:38,033
Mom. Don't mention him ever again.

976
00:53:38,774 --> 00:53:39,843
Please don't.

977
00:53:44,343 --> 00:53:47,213
She dislikes him so much.
What am I to do?

978
00:53:48,343 --> 00:53:50,584
You have one month
to change Do Ra's mind...

979
00:53:53,084 --> 00:53:55,124
If you don't,

980
00:53:55,954 --> 00:53:59,994
I'll make sure your daughter
is done for good as a celebrity.

981
00:54:02,263 --> 00:54:03,394
He wouldn't.

982
00:54:03,994 --> 00:54:06,263
Mr. Gong's not that evil.

983
00:54:17,544 --> 00:54:19,113
Where are you, Pil Seung?

984
00:54:22,084 --> 00:54:24,213
I just got home.

985
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:29,724
Me too.

986
00:54:30,053 --> 00:54:32,754
I had a photoshoot, interview,
and I shot a commercial today.

987
00:54:33,164 --> 00:54:34,624
I had a long, tiring day...

988
00:54:34,624 --> 00:54:36,894
just so I could
free up tomorrow to see you.

989
00:54:37,394 --> 00:54:39,093
Praise me, please.

990
00:54:42,204 --> 00:54:44,403
Good job, Ms. Park.

991
00:54:44,673 --> 00:54:45,874
I praise you.

992
00:54:45,934 --> 00:54:47,144
Pat on the head.

993
00:54:50,374 --> 00:54:52,544
I love it when you praise me.

994
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:54,814
What shall we do tomorrow?

995
00:55:02,524 --> 00:55:03,823
Shall we see the stars?

996
00:55:04,423 --> 00:55:06,024
I know where to go
to see lots of them.

997
00:55:07,564 --> 00:55:10,133
See the stars? I love it.

998
00:55:14,763 --> 00:55:15,863
Hang on.

999
00:55:27,684 --> 00:55:29,044
- Hi.
- Pil Seung.

1000
00:55:29,244 --> 00:55:31,553
How do you know where to go
to see lots of stars?

1001
00:55:31,783 --> 00:55:32,923
Who else did you take?

1002
00:55:34,954 --> 00:55:35,954
It's a secret.

1003
00:55:36,224 --> 00:55:38,093
What? It's a secret?

1004
00:55:38,524 --> 00:55:40,224
Why is it a secret?

1005
00:55:40,524 --> 00:55:41,664
Tell me right now.

1006
00:55:41,763 --> 00:55:44,133
I can't sleep if you won't tell me
who else you went with.

1007
00:55:44,934 --> 00:55:46,604
I was there to check out
a filming location.

1008
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:49,334
I see.

1009
00:55:50,434 --> 00:55:51,704
It was a filming location.

1010
00:55:53,104 --> 00:55:54,573
Were you being jealous?

1011
00:55:54,843 --> 00:55:56,213
That I went with someone else?

1012
00:55:56,244 --> 00:55:58,513
No, but...

1013
00:55:58,974 --> 00:56:00,914
I was curious.

1014
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:03,013
Bye.

1015
00:56:06,323 --> 00:56:07,954
Gosh, I'm so embarrassed!

1016
00:56:09,593 --> 00:56:11,653
Gosh, why is Park Do Ra so cute?

1017
00:56:30,443 --> 00:56:31,474
We're here.

1018
00:56:34,483 --> 00:56:36,584
Hey, Jae Dong.

1019
00:56:36,584 --> 00:56:38,283
Let me out here, and you can leave.

1020
00:56:38,553 --> 00:56:40,854
What? Who are you meeting?

1021
00:56:41,524 --> 00:56:43,524
How can I leave you here
in such a remote place?

1022
00:56:43,894 --> 00:56:46,423
Hey, this place isn't remote.

1023
00:56:46,724 --> 00:56:49,794
It's fine. My friend will be here
to pick me up. You can leave.

1024
00:56:49,794 --> 00:56:51,133
Which friend?

1025
00:56:51,334 --> 00:56:54,204
Hey. Do I have to tell you
every little detail?

1026
00:56:55,004 --> 00:56:57,903
Well, Jae Dong.
You worked so hard until now,

1027
00:56:57,903 --> 00:56:59,604
so you should go
and get a few days of rest, okay?

1028
00:57:00,744 --> 00:57:02,403
Okay, then. I'm really leaving.

1029
00:57:02,403 --> 00:57:04,843
- I told you to leave. Bye.
- Bye.

1030
00:57:16,323 --> 00:57:17,323
Here.

1031
00:57:17,653 --> 00:57:19,124
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1032
00:57:29,633 --> 00:57:32,274
Gosh, what did I just see?

1033
00:57:32,834 --> 00:57:34,244
Why did she get into...

1034
00:57:34,244 --> 00:57:35,604
the curly-haired
assistant director's clunker?

1035
00:57:37,274 --> 00:57:38,914
Why did she lie to me
about meeting a friend...

1036
00:57:38,914 --> 00:57:40,544
and meet up with him in secret?

1037
00:57:41,013 --> 00:57:42,113
What's up with those two?

1038
00:57:44,653 --> 00:57:46,883
Do Ra.
You can take off your mask here.

1039
00:57:46,923 --> 00:57:48,823
Our site is at the very end,
so no one will come by.

1040
00:57:49,283 --> 00:57:51,193
- Really?
- Yes.

1041
00:57:58,133 --> 00:58:01,004
Gosh, it's so refreshing.
I can finally breathe now.

1042
00:58:01,934 --> 00:58:05,204
But we're the farthest away from
the bathrooms and the sink.

1043
00:58:05,204 --> 00:58:07,144
So, it will be a little inconvenient
to go back and forth.

1044
00:58:07,144 --> 00:58:08,173
That's okay, right?

1045
00:58:08,173 --> 00:58:09,673
Of course it's okay.

1046
00:58:09,673 --> 00:58:11,213
Who cares
if it's a bit inconvenient?

1047
00:58:11,213 --> 00:58:14,184
We get to be here,
just the two of us, and be free.

1048
00:58:14,644 --> 00:58:15,983
Today's location is good.

1049
00:58:16,184 --> 00:58:18,454
I commend you. Five stars.

1050
00:58:18,854 --> 00:58:20,024
Pat, pat.

1051
00:58:20,024 --> 00:58:21,124
Thanks.

1052
00:58:26,564 --> 00:58:29,894
But this location feels
a little sneaky.

1053
00:58:30,633 --> 00:58:32,894
It's too far in the corner,
and I don't see anyone.

1054
00:58:34,033 --> 00:58:36,204
Was this place really a location
you scouted for a drama?

1055
00:58:38,334 --> 00:58:39,403
Actually, it wasn't.

1056
00:58:39,874 --> 00:58:42,343
It wasn't?
Then who did you come with?

1057
00:58:42,673 --> 00:58:44,013
Tell me the truth.

1058
00:58:44,943 --> 00:58:46,213
With a young...

1059
00:58:46,213 --> 00:58:47,644
Woman? For real?

1060
00:58:47,644 --> 00:58:49,854
Which woman did you come with?
Why did you come here?

1061
00:58:50,254 --> 00:58:51,684
I'm kidding. It's a joke.

1062
00:58:51,684 --> 00:58:53,724
I can't even joke around with you.

1063
00:58:53,724 --> 00:58:55,983
We came here to shoot
for the last drama.

1064
00:58:56,854 --> 00:58:59,693
Seriously,
why do you keep teasing me?

1065
00:58:59,693 --> 00:59:01,224
Try teasing me one more time.

1066
00:59:01,724 --> 00:59:02,724
All right.

1067
00:59:02,724 --> 00:59:03,733
What?

1068
00:59:03,733 --> 00:59:05,963
My Do Ra got in the clunker
of an assistant director...

1069
00:59:05,963 --> 00:59:08,704
and went somewhere,
just the two of them? Why?

1070
00:59:08,704 --> 00:59:10,803
I think the two of them are dating.

1071
00:59:10,803 --> 00:59:12,004
Are you crazy?

1072
00:59:12,374 --> 00:59:13,843
Unless my Do Ra has gone mad,

1073
00:59:13,843 --> 00:59:16,374
why would she date a small fry
like an assistant director?

1074
00:59:18,173 --> 00:59:21,914
Well, I think I saw...
No, I did see the wrong thing.

1075
00:59:23,084 --> 00:59:24,914
What's that
assistant director's name?

1076
00:59:25,283 --> 00:59:27,053
He's
Assistant Director Ko Pil Seung.

1077
00:59:27,454 --> 00:59:29,254
Ko Pil Seung?

1078
00:59:30,823 --> 00:59:31,923
Anyway, I got it.

1079
00:59:32,653 --> 00:59:34,064
You keep your mouth shut.

1080
00:59:34,923 --> 00:59:37,494
You know you can't speak about
this nonsense anywhere, right?

1081
00:59:37,693 --> 00:59:38,693
Yes, ma'am.

1082
00:59:39,693 --> 00:59:42,733
Hang on. Hey.
Take this as pocket money.

1083
00:59:43,104 --> 00:59:45,533
- No, I... Thank you.
- Go on.

1084
00:59:45,533 --> 00:59:46,744
- All right.
- Thank you.

1085
00:59:53,684 --> 00:59:57,254
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message...

1086
00:59:57,254 --> 00:59:59,153
Why, this little brat.

1087
00:59:59,153 --> 01:00:01,754
She even has her phone off.
What is she doing and where?

1088
01:00:03,653 --> 01:00:04,653
No way.

1089
01:00:05,693 --> 01:00:07,423
Of course not.

1090
01:00:07,423 --> 01:00:09,934
Unless my Do Ra has gone mad.

1091
01:00:19,434 --> 01:00:22,343
Do Ra. We're in the mountains,
so the night air is chilly.

1092
01:00:23,474 --> 01:00:24,513
Thanks.

1093
01:00:25,343 --> 01:00:26,843
We should share the blanket.

1094
01:00:27,113 --> 01:00:28,184
Okay.

1095
01:00:37,294 --> 01:00:38,323
Pil Seung.

1096
01:00:38,724 --> 01:00:41,564
There are so many stars here,
just like you said.

1097
01:00:42,164 --> 01:00:44,394
It's been so long since I've seen
so many stars like this.

1098
01:00:47,934 --> 01:00:51,504
Right at this moment,
I feel so happy.

1099
01:00:53,504 --> 01:00:54,644
What more do I need?

1100
01:00:55,173 --> 01:00:57,544
I have you right by my side,

1101
01:00:57,544 --> 01:00:59,644
and the sky is full
of shining jewels.

1102
01:01:06,254 --> 01:01:07,854
- One second.
- What?

1103
01:01:19,334 --> 01:01:21,533
What's that? Isn't that a guitar?

1104
01:01:23,104 --> 01:01:24,774
This is the highlight of camping.

1105
01:01:26,874 --> 01:01:28,673
Do you know
how to play the guitar too?

1106
01:01:28,673 --> 01:01:29,744
When did you learn to play?

1107
01:01:30,073 --> 01:01:31,443
I was in a band in college.

1108
01:01:32,713 --> 01:01:35,584
Are you going to play
little kids' songs or something?

1109
01:01:44,423 --> 01:01:46,624
What? You're good.

1110
01:01:48,024 --> 01:01:50,363
<i>What is there</i>

1111
01:01:50,863 --> 01:01:54,963
<i>That I can do</i>

1112
01:01:55,104 --> 01:01:57,274
<i>For you?</i>

1113
01:01:58,934 --> 01:02:01,144
<i>I think about that</i>

1114
01:02:03,343 --> 01:02:07,343
<i>Just sitting quietly</i>
<i>And listening to you talk</i>

1115
01:02:07,343 --> 01:02:11,314
<i>Walking down the street</i>
<i>As I keep pace with you</i>

1116
01:02:11,314 --> 01:02:14,153
<i>Singing a friendly song</i>

1117
01:02:14,153 --> 01:02:18,124
<i>For you</i>

1118
01:02:20,664 --> 01:02:21,664
What?

1119
01:02:25,963 --> 01:02:27,633
Do Ra, come inside.

1120
01:02:28,504 --> 01:02:30,604
What? Like this?

1121
01:02:35,644 --> 01:02:38,274
<i>Which jerk</i>

1122
01:02:38,613 --> 01:02:43,814
<i>Made my Do Ra angry?</i>

1123
01:02:44,483 --> 01:02:46,184
<i>Just say the word</i>

1124
01:02:46,184 --> 01:02:48,684
<i>I will scold him</i>

1125
01:02:49,053 --> 01:02:52,994
<i>Very harshly</i>

1126
01:02:52,994 --> 01:02:55,593
<i>If things get hard</i>

1127
01:02:55,794 --> 01:03:00,863
<i>You can always lean on me</i>

1128
01:03:01,363 --> 01:03:05,633
<i>I'm stronger than you think</i>

1129
01:03:05,633 --> 01:03:09,504
<i>Both my heart and body</i>

1130
01:03:10,774 --> 01:03:12,874
- Right foot, left foot.
- Left foot.

1131
01:03:12,874 --> 01:03:15,044
- Right foot, left foot.
- Left foot.

1132
01:03:35,204 --> 01:03:37,334
Pil Seung.
Thank you so much for today.

1133
01:03:38,004 --> 01:03:40,544
I feel like I had a therapeutic day
for the first time in a while...

1134
01:03:41,303 --> 01:03:43,573
and like I cleared out my head.

1135
01:03:45,573 --> 01:03:47,584
Hey, you should hurry up
and head inside.

1136
01:03:47,584 --> 01:03:49,013
What if someone sees us?

1137
01:03:50,053 --> 01:03:52,713
I think I'm becoming a kind person
after I started dating you.

1138
01:03:53,084 --> 01:03:55,084
Pil Seung,
let's go see the stars again.

1139
01:03:55,323 --> 01:03:56,653
So that I can become even kinder.

1140
01:03:59,323 --> 01:04:00,323
Park Do Ra.

1141
01:04:01,794 --> 01:04:03,193
You've always been kind.

1142
01:04:13,374 --> 01:04:16,073
What is that brat doing
in front of the house?

1143
01:04:16,774 --> 01:04:18,544
That assistant director...

1144
01:04:19,244 --> 01:04:20,283
Oh, my.

1145
01:04:21,144 --> 01:04:22,414
Isn't that guy...

1146
01:04:27,153 --> 01:04:29,323
Ko Dae Chung?

1147
01:04:30,823 --> 01:04:35,564
Hey!

1148
01:04:37,494 --> 01:04:38,494
Mom.

1149
01:04:40,104 --> 01:04:42,863
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1150
01:05:15,004 --> 01:05:17,633
It's a secret
you must take to the grave.

1151
01:05:17,633 --> 01:05:19,104
Everyone!

1152
01:05:19,104 --> 01:05:22,343
Where on earth do you think
she hid that child?

1153
01:05:22,343 --> 01:05:25,073
Even if you die and come back to life,
you can't date Pil Seung.

1154
01:05:25,144 --> 01:05:27,184
What do you mean by that?

1155
01:05:27,414 --> 01:05:29,443
Mom, I was wrong.

1156
01:05:29,443 --> 01:05:31,983
I'm sorry for hurting your feelings.

1157
01:05:32,783 --> 01:05:34,724
Why didn't you tell me?

1158
01:05:35,423 --> 01:05:36,423
Why...

1159
01:05:36,954 --> 01:05:39,124
Why did you suffer on your own?

1160
01:05:39,354 --> 01:05:41,394
I was so happy
while I was dating you.

1161
01:05:41,763 --> 01:05:43,394
But I think this is the end for us.

1162
01:05:43,763 --> 01:05:46,233
Let's break up now.

1163
01:05:47,133 --> 01:05:48,733
