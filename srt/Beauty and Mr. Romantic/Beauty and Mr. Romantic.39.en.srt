(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:10,927
(Episode 39)

3
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:12,118
Ji Young!

4
00:00:14,737 --> 00:00:15,958
Ji Young!

5
00:00:18,207 --> 00:00:19,558
Ji Young!

6
00:00:23,348 --> 00:00:24,527
Ji Young!

7
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:27,727
Ji Young!

8
00:00:30,248 --> 00:00:31,407
Ji Young!

9
00:00:31,858 --> 00:00:33,707
It wasn't you but me.

10
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:38,608
I was the one who betrayed you.

11
00:00:40,858 --> 00:00:42,578
All I did was inflict pain.

12
00:00:43,827 --> 00:00:45,587
All I did was hurt you.

13
00:00:50,437 --> 00:00:52,378
So why are you still...

14
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:54,758
choosing to be
by my side like a fool?

15
00:01:00,517 --> 00:01:03,837
You should've erased a witch
like me from your memories.

16
00:01:07,087 --> 00:01:08,407
You should've erased me.

17
00:01:13,528 --> 00:01:14,917
I'm sorry, Pil Seung...

18
00:01:18,138 --> 00:01:19,988
I'm sorry, Pil Seung.

19
00:01:28,148 --> 00:01:31,357
What on earth is going on?

20
00:01:31,448 --> 00:01:34,317
How could she have run off
in the middle of her scenes?

21
00:01:34,317 --> 00:01:36,517
This is upsetting.

22
00:01:36,517 --> 00:01:38,618
How could this happen
on the first day of filming?

23
00:01:38,618 --> 00:01:41,903
He shouldn't have cast
a girl like that in the first place.

24
00:01:41,927 --> 00:01:43,908
What a nuisance.

25
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,058
Mom, can't you see how everyone...

26
00:01:46,058 --> 00:01:48,178
is worried and frantically
looking for her? Be quiet.

27
00:01:48,498 --> 00:01:50,327
- What?
- It's getting dark,

28
00:01:50,327 --> 00:01:51,368
and it's also raining.

29
00:01:51,368 --> 00:01:52,567
How are they supposed...

30
00:01:52,567 --> 00:01:55,308
to find someone who ran off
without her phone in this weather?

31
00:01:55,308 --> 00:01:57,387
- This is bad.
- Goodness.

32
00:01:57,508 --> 00:01:58,688
Ms. Baek!

33
00:01:59,278 --> 00:02:01,258
My gosh.

34
00:02:01,748 --> 00:02:03,677
What happened to my Ji Young?

35
00:02:03,677 --> 00:02:04,997
Where's Ji Young?

36
00:02:05,217 --> 00:02:06,667
Weren't you able to find her?

37
00:02:07,248 --> 00:02:08,347
Not yet.

38
00:02:08,347 --> 00:02:10,997
You weren't able to find her?

39
00:02:11,288 --> 00:02:13,317
Then how could you
leave her out there...

40
00:02:13,317 --> 00:02:15,327
and only return by yourselves?

41
00:02:15,327 --> 00:02:17,527
- My gosh.
- I ran through the woods...

42
00:02:17,527 --> 00:02:19,908
in dress shoes
and sprained my ankle.

43
00:02:20,758 --> 00:02:22,818
The police have been notified,

44
00:02:23,267 --> 00:02:25,098
and they'll do a sweep of the woods.

45
00:02:25,098 --> 00:02:27,718
You should all head back
before it gets dark.

46
00:02:27,767 --> 00:02:29,438
No, I can't go!

47
00:02:29,438 --> 00:02:31,938
I won't leave!

48
00:02:31,938 --> 00:02:34,408
I won't leave
until my Ji Young is found.

49
00:02:34,408 --> 00:02:35,647
I won't go!

50
00:02:35,647 --> 00:02:38,318
- Ma'am.
- Ma'am, please.

51
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:41,598
Ji Young, my gosh!

52
00:02:41,688 --> 00:02:44,068
- Ji Young!
- Goodness.

53
00:02:45,918 --> 00:02:49,388
<i>Until the day the East Sea runs dry</i>

54
00:02:49,388 --> 00:02:53,128
<i>- And Mount Baekdu is worn away</i>
- Gosh. Must you make it worse?

55
00:02:53,128 --> 00:02:54,634
I can't believe you.

56
00:02:54,658 --> 00:02:55,867
Ji Young.

57
00:02:55,867 --> 00:02:57,348
- Ji Young!
- Are you all right?

58
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:01,318
- Ji Young!
- I found her!

59
00:03:01,468 --> 00:03:02,688
Over here, Director.

60
00:03:03,207 --> 00:03:04,357
Where?

61
00:03:05,177 --> 00:03:06,487
Director Ko, over here.

62
00:03:08,547 --> 00:03:09,697
She's here.

63
00:03:10,777 --> 00:03:12,227
- Ji Young.
- Hello?

64
00:03:12,848 --> 00:03:14,528
- You must get here quick.
- Ji Young.

65
00:03:15,948 --> 00:03:17,998
Ji Young, open your eyes.

66
00:03:18,218 --> 00:03:19,368
Ji Young!

67
00:03:20,587 --> 00:03:21,737
Ji Young?

68
00:03:28,698 --> 00:03:30,177
Pil Seung...

69
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:40,827
Ji Young?

70
00:03:41,478 --> 00:03:42,697
Ji Young?

71
00:03:43,608 --> 00:03:44,758
Ji Young?

72
00:03:48,848 --> 00:03:51,237
Goodness me, Ji Young.

73
00:03:51,617 --> 00:03:53,617
What is wrong with her?

74
00:03:53,617 --> 00:03:55,477
Why isn't she waking up?

75
00:03:55,728 --> 00:03:57,158
Ms. Lee, don't worry too much.

76
00:03:57,158 --> 00:03:58,957
She's only sleeping.

77
00:03:58,957 --> 00:04:00,403
Is that so?

78
00:04:00,427 --> 00:04:02,248
The doctor just said...

79
00:04:02,327 --> 00:04:04,267
that she was stressed out,

80
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:05,698
but she'll be fine.

81
00:04:05,698 --> 00:04:07,337
Right, I see.

82
00:04:07,337 --> 00:04:10,517
Director Ko, shouldn't you
have left by now?

83
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:12,758
Why are you still here?

84
00:04:13,638 --> 00:04:16,128
The female lead in my drama series
passed out on set.

85
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:19,968
I have a responsibility to see
that she regains consciousness.

86
00:04:20,348 --> 00:04:21,498
Why is that?

87
00:04:21,888 --> 00:04:22,888
Are you worried
you'll go over budget...

88
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,097
if you have to postpone filming
for a few days?

89
00:04:24,718 --> 00:04:26,608
I'll make up for all that.

90
00:04:30,828 --> 00:04:32,548
Don't my words
carry any weight with you?

91
00:04:33,697 --> 00:04:36,678
How dare you disrespect me
by ignoring me?

92
00:04:37,127 --> 00:04:38,937
Why are you
at each other's throats...

93
00:04:38,937 --> 00:04:41,818
when someone is lying sick
trying to recover?

94
00:04:42,067 --> 00:04:43,668
I'll call when she wakes up.

95
00:04:43,668 --> 00:04:47,527
Director Ko, Mr. Gong,
you both should leave.

96
00:04:47,778 --> 00:04:49,723
Jae Dong, you as well.

97
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,778
She'll be startled
and embarrassed to wake up...

98
00:04:52,778 --> 00:04:55,097
to a bunch of people around her bed.

99
00:04:55,317 --> 00:04:56,767
Director Ko, please leave.

100
00:04:57,817 --> 00:05:00,694
Sure thing. Please give me a call.

101
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:01,907
I will.

102
00:05:06,398 --> 00:05:08,077
We should go.

103
00:05:13,797 --> 00:05:15,558
Who are you
to still be standing there?

104
00:05:15,768 --> 00:05:17,017
Get going as well.

105
00:05:17,307 --> 00:05:19,838
Ms. Lee, I'm Ji Young's boyfriend.

106
00:05:19,838 --> 00:05:21,177
This is where I should be.

107
00:05:21,177 --> 00:05:23,408
You left her behind in the woods...

108
00:05:23,408 --> 00:05:25,418
just to save your own skin,

109
00:05:25,418 --> 00:05:26,848
but you call yourself her boyfriend?

110
00:05:26,848 --> 00:05:28,288
Boyfriend, my foot.

111
00:05:28,288 --> 00:05:29,947
I already explained myself.

112
00:05:29,947 --> 00:05:32,887
I happened to be wearing
pointy dress shoes today.

113
00:05:32,887 --> 00:05:34,458
Trying to find Ji Young
in the woods...

114
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,658
led to my feet being scraped
from all the chafing.

115
00:05:36,658 --> 00:05:37,958
They hurt.

116
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:42,077
You little weasel.
You're all talk, aren't you?

117
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:45,737
I hate your guts, so get lost.

118
00:05:45,737 --> 00:05:47,038
Get lost now.

119
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:48,858
Mr. Gong, gosh.

120
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:51,517
Head home, and I'll call you.

121
00:05:51,677 --> 00:05:53,228
Fine.

122
00:05:53,538 --> 00:05:55,798
Please let me know
when she wakes up.

123
00:05:56,947 --> 00:05:58,767
Ms. Lee, I'll get going.

124
00:05:59,677 --> 00:06:00,827
Darn.

125
00:06:04,218 --> 00:06:05,368
Goodness, Ji Young.

126
00:06:05,817 --> 00:06:09,577
Please wake up. I'm upset as it is.

127
00:06:09,757 --> 00:06:12,248
Please wake up.

128
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,347
Gosh.

129
00:06:19,538 --> 00:06:23,168
Ji Young, have you come to?

130
00:06:23,168 --> 00:06:25,527
Do you know who I am?

131
00:06:27,937 --> 00:06:29,097
Hey.

132
00:06:30,677 --> 00:06:31,677
Goodness.

133
00:06:31,677 --> 00:06:32,817
Grandma.

134
00:06:32,817 --> 00:06:35,267
That's right, Ji Young.

135
00:06:35,547 --> 00:06:39,637
Ji Young, it's Mom.

136
00:06:49,197 --> 00:06:51,867
Why are you this selfish
when we might all starve to death?

137
00:06:51,867 --> 00:06:53,437
Let's all dive into the Han River
and die, then.

138
00:06:53,437 --> 00:06:54,697
- Come on.
- Mom...

139
00:06:54,697 --> 00:06:56,838
- Let's all die.
- Mom, no.

140
00:06:56,838 --> 00:06:58,708
Mr. Gong will take care of it.

141
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,928
Mr. Gong will take down
all the articles...

142
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:03,078
and pay back all our debts.

143
00:07:03,078 --> 00:07:04,708
So Do Ra...

144
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,718
- Give me back my money!
- Ma'am.

145
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,247
A nude photo shoot
isn't a bad thing.

146
00:07:09,247 --> 00:07:10,767
It's art.

147
00:07:13,487 --> 00:07:15,878
What's wrong?

148
00:07:16,627 --> 00:07:18,804
Ji Young. What's wrong?

149
00:07:18,828 --> 00:07:20,048
Ji Young, what's wrong?

150
00:07:20,528 --> 00:07:22,074
- What's wrong?
- Doctor.

151
00:07:22,098 --> 00:07:24,618
Get the doctor.
What's wrong, Ji Young?

152
00:07:24,697 --> 00:07:26,538
I'll go get the doctor.

153
00:07:26,538 --> 00:07:28,418
What's wrong with her?

154
00:07:29,507 --> 00:07:31,087
What is it, Ji Young?

155
00:07:31,168 --> 00:07:33,254
- Doctor!
- What's the matter?

156
00:07:33,278 --> 00:07:35,798
- Grandma.
- Okay.

157
00:07:36,047 --> 00:07:38,454
Ji Young, if it's too much on you,

158
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:40,368
you don't have to act.

159
00:07:40,718 --> 00:07:43,897
Let's live by the sea,
harvest Manila clams,

160
00:07:43,947 --> 00:07:45,288
and sell kalguksu for a living.

161
00:07:45,288 --> 00:07:46,757
- Okay, Ji Young?
- Grandma.

162
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,163
It's okay.

163
00:07:48,187 --> 00:07:50,337
- Ji Young.
- Ji Young.

164
00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:53,248
Do Sik.

165
00:07:54,997 --> 00:07:56,147
Do Jun.

166
00:07:57,197 --> 00:07:59,787
Do Jun.

167
00:07:59,838 --> 00:08:01,338
Do Jun.

168
00:08:01,338 --> 00:08:03,768
- What's wrong with my sister?
- Do Sik.

169
00:08:03,768 --> 00:08:05,377
- Yes, I'm right here.
- Do Sik.

170
00:08:05,377 --> 00:08:07,558
Do Sik.

171
00:08:08,177 --> 00:08:09,327
Do Sik.

172
00:08:18,887 --> 00:08:20,037
Pil Seung.

173
00:08:22,927 --> 00:08:24,178
That spot.

174
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:27,577
It was near the vacation home.

175
00:08:29,528 --> 00:08:32,147
Something happened
to Ji Young there.

176
00:08:34,437 --> 00:08:36,657
Did memories of that time
come back to her?

177
00:08:39,307 --> 00:08:40,988
Is that why she freaked out today?

178
00:08:42,407 --> 00:08:45,868
Hello. How is Kim Ji Young doing?

179
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:47,897
Is she still asleep?

180
00:08:48,318 --> 00:08:50,238
Kim Ji Young...

181
00:08:50,318 --> 00:08:51,934
She woke up.

182
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,958
She was showing signs of anxiety,

183
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,708
so we gave her a sedative.
She's asleep now.

184
00:08:56,558 --> 00:08:58,037
Oh, okay.

185
00:08:58,828 --> 00:09:00,008
Will she be okay?

186
00:09:00,098 --> 00:09:02,298
Yes. She's much calmer now,

187
00:09:02,298 --> 00:09:04,677
and the doctor said
she had no other issues.

188
00:09:05,997 --> 00:09:07,448
Okay. Thank you.

189
00:09:14,478 --> 00:09:16,247
Are you here out of concern?

190
00:09:16,247 --> 00:09:18,777
- For your sister?
- I hope she wakes up.

191
00:09:18,777 --> 00:09:21,067
Yes. I hope so too.

192
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,487
Hey, Ji Young. Are you okay?

193
00:09:28,487 --> 00:09:30,708
What? Ji Young.

194
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:42,317
Yes.

195
00:09:44,308 --> 00:09:45,687
I'm fine.

196
00:09:46,007 --> 00:09:48,088
You can all go home and rest.

197
00:09:48,948 --> 00:09:51,647
We can't leave you
when you're not well.

198
00:09:51,647 --> 00:09:53,728
I said I'm fine. Go home.

199
00:09:55,747 --> 00:09:57,188
I want to be alone.

200
00:09:57,188 --> 00:10:00,188
I'll stay with her alone, then.

201
00:10:00,188 --> 00:10:02,733
I can't leave her here on her own.

202
00:10:02,757 --> 00:10:06,407
Grandma, you can stay.
Go home, Ms. Baek.

203
00:10:07,897 --> 00:10:11,218
Do Sik, Do Jun. Take her home.

204
00:10:11,938 --> 00:10:14,438
Are you sure we can go?

205
00:10:14,438 --> 00:10:16,517
Yes. I'm really okay.

206
00:10:17,808 --> 00:10:21,157
Grandma can't manage without me,
so I'll let her stay.

207
00:10:25,007 --> 00:10:28,067
Do Sik, Do Jun.
Go and get some rest.

208
00:10:28,348 --> 00:10:30,848
Okay, then. Let's go home.

209
00:10:30,848 --> 00:10:34,034
Ji Young can't rest
if the room's crowded.

210
00:10:34,058 --> 00:10:36,103
Let's go home. We can go.

211
00:10:36,127 --> 00:10:38,008
Rest up, Ji Young. We're off.

212
00:10:38,058 --> 00:10:40,047
Call right away
if something's wrong.

213
00:10:40,728 --> 00:10:43,547
I will. Don't worry.

214
00:10:44,428 --> 00:10:46,187
- Go ahead.
- Bye.

215
00:10:46,468 --> 00:10:48,448
Bye. Let's go. Get some rest.

216
00:10:52,178 --> 00:10:53,527
Goodness.

217
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,228
Oh, my gosh.

218
00:11:04,787 --> 00:11:07,167
- Grandma.
- Yes?

219
00:11:07,358 --> 00:11:09,537
What is it?

220
00:11:10,088 --> 00:11:11,838
Do you have something to say?

221
00:11:12,698 --> 00:11:17,448
If you do, you can tell me anything.

222
00:11:18,397 --> 00:11:23,218
Are you sure
you're not sick or hurt?

223
00:11:25,507 --> 00:11:26,687
I'm not.

224
00:11:27,507 --> 00:11:28,958
I'm fine.

225
00:11:31,178 --> 00:11:32,667
I'm just fine.

226
00:11:32,877 --> 00:11:36,688
Then why did you freak out
like that?

227
00:11:36,688 --> 00:11:37,993
You poor thing.

228
00:11:38,017 --> 00:11:39,208
I guess...

229
00:11:40,987 --> 00:11:43,078
I got a bit too much
into my character.

230
00:11:43,688 --> 00:11:45,177
No.

231
00:11:45,858 --> 00:11:47,978
It didn't look like that.

232
00:11:48,698 --> 00:11:52,647
You had so many surgeries
after I found you,

233
00:11:52,897 --> 00:11:55,458
and you suffered
from the side effects.

234
00:11:55,838 --> 00:11:59,027
Did you have one of those
painful side effects?

235
00:11:59,308 --> 00:12:05,157
Why have they been bothering you
for this long?

236
00:12:07,478 --> 00:12:09,167
- Grandma.
- Yes.

237
00:12:13,088 --> 00:12:15,008
I'm okay, Grandma.

238
00:12:16,588 --> 00:12:18,238
I'm really okay.

239
00:12:20,828 --> 00:12:22,118
I'm...

240
00:12:23,928 --> 00:12:27,317
I'm just fine if I have you.

241
00:12:28,068 --> 00:12:29,317
Oh, gosh...

242
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:34,057
Thank you, Grandma.

243
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:37,308
- Grandma.
- Yes.

244
00:12:37,308 --> 00:12:39,324
Thank you, Grandma.

245
00:12:39,348 --> 00:12:41,517
Yes, I thank you too.

246
00:12:41,517 --> 00:12:45,907
I'm grateful you stayed alive
and came back to me.

247
00:12:46,757 --> 00:12:48,637
Thanks, Grandma.

248
00:12:48,858 --> 00:12:51,037
My dear baby.

249
00:13:00,367 --> 00:13:01,647
Grandma.

250
00:13:07,438 --> 00:13:08,657
You know,

251
00:13:12,678 --> 00:13:16,537
I remembered what Mom did to me.

252
00:13:25,657 --> 00:13:28,248
But I don't want to believe
those memories.

253
00:13:34,137 --> 00:13:36,317
I'm too scared to bring them up...

254
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:44,297
in case they're all real.

255
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:50,238
How could Mom do that to me?

256
00:13:53,858 --> 00:13:57,177
She shouldn't have
if she were my real mom.

257
00:14:06,298 --> 00:14:08,088
She shouldn't.

258
00:14:19,478 --> 00:14:20,667
Grandma.

259
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:54,048
I put up the room for rent
because you said...

260
00:14:54,048 --> 00:14:57,267
you'd go to the Philippines,
but I should take it back.

261
00:14:58,048 --> 00:15:01,108
I apologize.
I was going to leave on business,

262
00:15:02,328 --> 00:15:03,978
but I found my son.

263
00:15:04,527 --> 00:15:06,748
- What? Your son?
- My gosh.

264
00:15:07,098 --> 00:15:08,378
You had a son?

265
00:15:08,558 --> 00:15:12,047
What son?
You said you were childless.

266
00:15:12,468 --> 00:15:14,088
I had no idea,

267
00:15:14,237 --> 00:15:16,917
but my first love
who I dated back then...

268
00:15:17,007 --> 00:15:18,887
had and raised my son.

269
00:15:19,407 --> 00:15:21,027
I just found out.

270
00:15:21,407 --> 00:15:25,924
That son of yours
must be a grown-up by now.

271
00:15:25,948 --> 00:15:27,647
Yes. He works at a large company.

272
00:15:27,647 --> 00:15:30,763
My gosh. I'm so pleased for you.

273
00:15:30,787 --> 00:15:34,167
This is a story
worthy of being a drama plot.

274
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:35,804
That's great.

275
00:15:35,828 --> 00:15:39,108
So, about the woman. Is she single?

276
00:15:39,728 --> 00:15:40,878
Yes.

277
00:15:41,127 --> 00:15:44,777
You should get back with her
if you have a son.

278
00:15:45,298 --> 00:15:47,317
We can't do that right now.

279
00:15:47,798 --> 00:15:49,557
I plan to move in with her soon.

280
00:15:50,068 --> 00:15:53,057
That's just great, Sang Gu.

281
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:56,383
You should introduce her
to us one day.

282
00:15:56,407 --> 00:15:58,647
Bring her to our restaurant.

283
00:15:58,647 --> 00:16:00,368
- Sure, I'll do that.
- Yes.

284
00:16:04,348 --> 00:16:06,108
Ji Young.

285
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:09,058
Why are you suddenly packing?
Where are you going?

286
00:16:09,058 --> 00:16:11,238
And what do you mean
you found a place to live?

287
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:13,934
I've been telling you...

288
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:16,478
that living here with you
was just too uncomfortable.

289
00:16:18,127 --> 00:16:21,017
How many rooms
does your new place have?

290
00:16:21,698 --> 00:16:25,458
I found a decent place
to live with Grandma.

291
00:16:26,938 --> 00:16:28,678
That makes no sense, Ji Young.

292
00:16:28,678 --> 00:16:31,507
We can't part like this
when we've found each other again.

293
00:16:31,507 --> 00:16:32,924
We'll move with you, then.

294
00:16:32,948 --> 00:16:35,524
You're not coming anywhere with us,
you witch.

295
00:16:35,548 --> 00:16:37,397
- Why you...
- That darn old hag.

296
00:16:37,548 --> 00:16:39,294
You keep still, Grandma.

297
00:16:39,318 --> 00:16:40,468
Okay.

298
00:16:42,287 --> 00:16:43,437
Ms. Baek.

299
00:16:44,088 --> 00:16:45,307
I tried as hard as I could,

300
00:16:45,798 --> 00:16:48,098
but to be honest,
you don't feel like my mom.

301
00:16:48,098 --> 00:16:49,248
It's just too awkward.

302
00:16:49,798 --> 00:16:52,988
Let's talk again
when my memories return.

303
00:16:53,698 --> 00:16:54,948
Kim Ji Young.

304
00:16:55,298 --> 00:16:56,938
You and I are mother and daughter.

305
00:16:56,938 --> 00:16:58,767
You saw the DNA test result.

306
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,687
You are my daughter.

307
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:05,328
You're not on good terms
with my grandma.

308
00:17:06,218 --> 00:17:08,598
And my new drama is starting.

309
00:17:09,417 --> 00:17:12,138
I can't focus
on my script reading here.

310
00:17:12,758 --> 00:17:14,908
I can't even rest at ease
after work.

311
00:17:16,157 --> 00:17:19,328
For those reasons,
until I regain all my memories,

312
00:17:19,328 --> 00:17:22,107
I want to live as Kim Ji Young
and not as your daughter Park Do Ra.

313
00:17:22,867 --> 00:17:25,738
So I'm moving out
before I get too busy.

314
00:17:25,738 --> 00:17:27,148
That is it.

315
00:17:29,867 --> 00:17:32,038
- Let's go, Grandma.
- All right. Let's go.

316
00:17:32,038 --> 00:17:34,977
Wait. This isn't right.
You can't leave like this, Ji Young.

317
00:17:34,977 --> 00:17:36,647
If you want to go,
you will have to take me with you.

318
00:17:36,647 --> 00:17:39,147
And I can't live without you.

319
00:17:39,147 --> 00:17:41,818
You darn witch.
Stop trying to leach off her.

320
00:17:41,818 --> 00:17:43,417
- My goodness.
- Gosh, let go of my arms!

321
00:17:43,417 --> 00:17:45,117
- Let go of me.
- Mom, please. Just let her go.

322
00:17:45,117 --> 00:17:47,588
- Get off me, will you? Hey!
- Hurry and go.

323
00:17:47,588 --> 00:17:48,917
- Geum Dong.
- Yes.

324
00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:51,157
I'll call you.

325
00:17:51,157 --> 00:17:53,498
You have to break up with her, okay?

326
00:17:53,498 --> 00:17:54,897
- Okay. Go.
- That darn old lady.

327
00:17:54,897 --> 00:17:56,197
- Gosh.
- Hey, get off me.

328
00:17:56,197 --> 00:17:57,298
Hey, Ji Young!

329
00:17:57,298 --> 00:17:59,768
Let go of me, you fool!

330
00:17:59,768 --> 00:18:02,738
Hey. How could you
let Ji Young go like that?

331
00:18:02,738 --> 00:18:03,867
You didn't even try to stop her.

332
00:18:03,867 --> 00:18:05,458
I can't believe this.

333
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:08,477
Ji Young.

334
00:18:08,477 --> 00:18:10,827
Ji Young.

335
00:18:12,207 --> 00:18:13,398
Do Sik.

336
00:18:14,248 --> 00:18:16,767
Please understand
that I want to move out.

337
00:18:17,488 --> 00:18:19,438
And tell Ms. Baek about it for me.

338
00:18:20,187 --> 00:18:22,067
I'm sorry.

339
00:18:22,457 --> 00:18:23,638
Mom...

340
00:18:23,988 --> 00:18:25,238
Mom!

341
00:18:25,627 --> 00:18:27,307
My gosh.

342
00:18:27,457 --> 00:18:28,607
Ji Young.

343
00:18:28,727 --> 00:18:31,517
Do Ra. Ji Young, wait. Hey.

344
00:18:31,697 --> 00:18:33,738
We need to talk, Ji Young.

345
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:36,143
Don't go. Wait, Ji Young.

346
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:37,967
- Ji Young!
- Gosh.

347
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:39,183
My goodness.

348
00:18:39,207 --> 00:18:41,428
Mom, just let her go. Let's go in.

349
00:18:41,637 --> 00:18:43,907
Hey, she just abandoned us,

350
00:18:43,907 --> 00:18:45,797
and you are just letting it happen?

351
00:18:47,147 --> 00:18:48,917
I can't believe
she's doing this to me.

352
00:18:48,917 --> 00:18:50,748
I mean, I'm her mom.

353
00:18:50,748 --> 00:18:52,617
But how could she
leave just like that...

354
00:18:52,617 --> 00:18:54,657
with that senile old lady
who's not even related to her?

355
00:18:54,657 --> 00:18:57,657
She didn't get her memories back,
so she's uncomfortable around us.

356
00:18:57,657 --> 00:18:59,248
Can't you be understanding?

357
00:18:59,498 --> 00:19:02,178
It is actually uncomfortable to live
all together in this tiny place.

358
00:19:03,598 --> 00:19:05,748
Hey, Do Sik.

359
00:19:05,967 --> 00:19:09,508
How do you think she got the money
to find a place to live?

360
00:19:09,508 --> 00:19:11,937
I think she's been stashing
some money away without telling us.

361
00:19:11,937 --> 00:19:14,488
She doesn't seem like our Do Ra.

362
00:19:14,977 --> 00:19:18,127
How could she abandon us
to save her own skin?

363
00:19:18,348 --> 00:19:19,717
Is she really our Do Ra?

364
00:19:19,717 --> 00:19:22,447
And when do you think
she will regain her memories?

365
00:19:22,447 --> 00:19:23,917
It's better for her
to live without her memories.

366
00:19:23,917 --> 00:19:25,788
if she regains them,
it will only give her hard times.

367
00:19:25,788 --> 00:19:26,887
If she remembers,

368
00:19:26,887 --> 00:19:29,058
she won't even want
to see you ever again.

369
00:19:29,058 --> 00:19:30,127
What did you say?

370
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,088
You brat. Why does she not want
to see me when she's my daughter?

371
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:34,908
That's just immoral, you fool.

372
00:19:35,558 --> 00:19:36,877
My goodness.

373
00:19:40,467 --> 00:19:41,697
Come in, Grandma.

374
00:19:41,697 --> 00:19:43,488
Okay. My gosh.

375
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:45,787
Oh, dear.

376
00:19:46,238 --> 00:19:48,428
Gosh, Ji Young.

377
00:19:48,977 --> 00:19:52,767
This place is so nice and clean.

378
00:19:53,147 --> 00:19:56,438
We should've moved in here sooner.

379
00:19:56,717 --> 00:19:59,468
I'm so happy that we moved.

380
00:20:00,588 --> 00:20:01,738
Grandma.

381
00:20:02,627 --> 00:20:03,777
I'm sorry.

382
00:20:04,588 --> 00:20:06,908
You've been through a lot
because of me.

383
00:20:07,858 --> 00:20:11,328
I'll be sure to work hard
and pay the deposit back.

384
00:20:11,328 --> 00:20:12,547
Come on.

385
00:20:13,998 --> 00:20:15,418
Thank you, Grandma.

386
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:20,527
I will never forget
what you've done for me.

387
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:24,057
I mean,

388
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,398
I'll remember it forever.

389
00:20:26,778 --> 00:20:29,067
My gosh.

390
00:20:30,988 --> 00:20:32,168
You silly thing.

391
00:20:32,818 --> 00:20:35,067
What are you talking about?

392
00:20:35,858 --> 00:20:37,727
My money is your money.

393
00:20:37,727 --> 00:20:39,777
Don't say such a thing.

394
00:20:41,457 --> 00:20:42,648
You know what?

395
00:20:43,732 --> 00:20:46,653
If I see you happy and content,

396
00:20:47,238 --> 00:20:50,517
there’s nothing more
I could ask for in this world.

397
00:20:59,108 --> 00:21:01,848
<i>Until the day the East Sea runs dry</i>

398
00:21:01,848 --> 00:21:04,387
<i>And Mount Baekdu</i>

399
00:21:04,387 --> 00:21:08,767
<i>Is worn away</i>

400
00:21:09,187 --> 00:21:13,828
<i>May the deities protect our nation</i>

401
00:21:13,828 --> 00:21:17,377
<i>Hurray to Korea</i>

402
00:21:17,927 --> 00:21:20,498
- Grandma.
<i>- Roses of Sharon</i>

403
00:21:20,498 --> 00:21:22,347
Please stay healthy.

404
00:21:24,407 --> 00:21:27,258
You are all I have.

405
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,809
How could you do that as a man?

406
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,309
What do you mean?

407
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:43,009
I said I had feelings for you.

408
00:21:43,129 --> 00:21:45,770
Then why didn't you
say something in return,

409
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,680
like whether or not you liked me?

410
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:53,489
Why are you still thinking?

411
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:57,160
Just tell me if you like me or not.

412
00:21:58,409 --> 00:21:59,799
Do you not like me?

413
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,029
It's not that I don't like you.

414
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:07,156
What? That means you like me too.

415
00:22:07,156 --> 00:22:09,293
Why can't you just say that?

416
00:22:13,954 --> 00:22:15,134
Is it...

417
00:22:17,224 --> 00:22:18,853
because I'm dumb...

418
00:22:18,853 --> 00:22:21,074
No. I swear it's nothing like that.

419
00:22:23,424 --> 00:22:25,384
It's because
I'm not good enough for you.

420
00:22:28,434 --> 00:22:29,964
What does that mean?

421
00:22:29,964 --> 00:22:33,309
There's no one as handsome
and charming as you.

422
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:35,223
What makes you say that?

423
00:22:35,674 --> 00:22:37,394
My family is broke,

424
00:22:38,113 --> 00:22:40,193
so I couldn't even finish my school.

425
00:22:42,184 --> 00:22:43,744
I like you too,

426
00:22:43,744 --> 00:22:46,533
but I'm not financially stable
enough to support you.

427
00:22:47,754 --> 00:22:49,674
Why would you support me?

428
00:22:49,924 --> 00:22:52,674
We should just love
and care for each other.

429
00:22:55,063 --> 00:22:57,513
When you love someone,
you want to support the person.

430
00:22:59,863 --> 00:23:01,013
My gosh.

431
00:23:01,404 --> 00:23:02,704
Do Jun, you just sounded...

432
00:23:02,704 --> 00:23:05,504
even cooler than a prince
in fairy tales.

433
00:23:05,504 --> 00:23:08,154
I mean, even a prince wouldn't say
such a sweet thing.

434
00:23:10,303 --> 00:23:11,554
But Do Jun,

435
00:23:12,014 --> 00:23:13,444
I have a rich family.

436
00:23:13,444 --> 00:23:14,984
So you don't have to worry about it.

437
00:23:14,984 --> 00:23:17,763
I'll ask my mom
to double your salary.

438
00:23:18,214 --> 00:23:19,703
No, don't do that.

439
00:23:19,984 --> 00:23:21,773
That wouldn't be
what I earned on my own.

440
00:23:23,623 --> 00:23:25,404
I want to be a big support for you,

441
00:23:26,524 --> 00:23:28,443
but I'm not capable of it yet.

442
00:23:30,164 --> 00:23:31,374
Don't you think...

443
00:23:31,893 --> 00:23:35,683
it's fine
as long as we like each other?

444
00:23:38,533 --> 00:23:40,983
I like you.

445
00:23:42,444 --> 00:23:43,723
I really do, Do Jun.

446
00:23:46,444 --> 00:23:49,834
So just go out with me.

447
00:24:23,984 --> 00:24:25,164
Hey, Ji Young.

448
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,104
What?

449
00:24:31,123 --> 00:24:32,304
Come in.

450
00:24:33,194 --> 00:24:36,043
Ji Young, are you sure
this is my room?

451
00:24:36,494 --> 00:24:39,384
Yes. What do you think?
Do you like it?

452
00:24:40,234 --> 00:24:42,614
Totally. I love it.

453
00:24:43,803 --> 00:24:45,953
I'm glad you like it.

454
00:24:46,504 --> 00:24:49,223
I set up your room first
as soon as I moved in here.

455
00:24:50,004 --> 00:24:52,763
So, Do Jun, you should come often.

456
00:24:53,073 --> 00:24:54,394
I will.

457
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:59,634
Ji Young, it's a good thing
you moved out.

458
00:25:00,754 --> 00:25:04,304
Actually, I wanted to get a room
where we could stay together.

459
00:25:09,893 --> 00:25:11,074
Do Jun.

460
00:25:12,563 --> 00:25:14,043
Is your hand all right?

461
00:25:15,204 --> 00:25:16,753
It hurt a lot, didn't it?

462
00:25:17,033 --> 00:25:19,554
It's okay. It got better quickly.

463
00:25:22,474 --> 00:25:23,723
You know what?

464
00:25:25,944 --> 00:25:28,564
I didn't mind anything else,

465
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:32,703
but I felt really bad for you.

466
00:25:34,714 --> 00:25:37,804
You couldn't even finish
your school.

467
00:25:39,924 --> 00:25:42,243
I'm so sorry, Do Jun.

468
00:25:47,863 --> 00:25:49,114
Ji Young.

469
00:25:50,164 --> 00:25:51,753
Do you remember everything?

470
00:25:52,974 --> 00:25:54,324
You're Do Ra, right?

471
00:25:54,633 --> 00:25:56,594
You got your memories back,
didn't you?

472
00:25:58,274 --> 00:25:59,463
Do Jun...

473
00:26:00,043 --> 00:26:03,463
Do Ra, you remember now, don't you?

474
00:26:06,254 --> 00:26:07,463
I do.

475
00:26:09,323 --> 00:26:11,533
I remember everything.

476
00:26:11,893 --> 00:26:13,074
Do Ra!

477
00:26:14,593 --> 00:26:17,144
I missed you so much.

478
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:21,713
It broke my heart
when you didn't recognize me.

479
00:26:22,533 --> 00:26:26,253
Why did you die
leaving me all alone?

480
00:26:26,303 --> 00:26:27,983
I'm sorry.

481
00:26:28,174 --> 00:26:31,554
I'm so sorry, Do Jun.

482
00:26:32,744 --> 00:26:36,064
No, don't be. Thank you, Do Ra.

483
00:26:36,214 --> 00:26:38,783
Thank you for being alive.

484
00:26:38,783 --> 00:26:41,364
Everything will be all right now.

485
00:26:47,053 --> 00:26:50,344
Do Jun, listen to me carefully.

486
00:26:52,133 --> 00:26:56,213
No one else can know
that I remember who I was.

487
00:26:56,303 --> 00:26:58,453
Not even Mom or Do Sik.

488
00:26:59,934 --> 00:27:03,193
I'm going to continue living
as Kim Ji Young.

489
00:27:04,303 --> 00:27:06,124
Do Ra, what are you saying?

490
00:27:07,514 --> 00:27:09,164
People in this world...

491
00:27:09,444 --> 00:27:11,963
won't understand
why I chose to live as Ji Young.

492
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:15,574
Once I prove that I didn't
have a secret sponsor,

493
00:27:16,484 --> 00:27:18,404
I'll reveal who I am.

494
00:27:19,524 --> 00:27:23,374
Do Ra, what happened to you
before you died?

495
00:27:23,694 --> 00:27:25,814
You can tell me everything.

496
00:27:26,863 --> 00:27:28,013
Later.

497
00:27:29,704 --> 00:27:33,953
After I sort everything out,
I'll tell you everything.

498
00:27:35,103 --> 00:27:36,624
But I can't until then.

499
00:27:37,603 --> 00:27:39,463
Do you get what I'm saying?

500
00:27:41,414 --> 00:27:42,634
I get it.

501
00:27:44,543 --> 00:27:46,164
Geum Dong!

502
00:27:46,484 --> 00:27:49,074
Goodness, Geum Dong is here.

503
00:27:55,363 --> 00:27:57,443
There you go.

504
00:27:58,764 --> 00:28:01,183
- Dig in.
- Sure.

505
00:28:02,164 --> 00:28:04,283
My grandma's kalguksu is the best.

506
00:28:05,004 --> 00:28:06,904
Do Jun, dig in.

507
00:28:06,904 --> 00:28:08,124
Sure.

508
00:28:12,573 --> 00:28:13,763
How is it?

509
00:28:16,813 --> 00:28:17,984
It's really good.

510
00:28:17,984 --> 00:28:20,233
- Grandma, it's delicious.
- Really?

511
00:28:20,283 --> 00:28:21,660
Mom, we should open a diner.

512
00:28:21,684 --> 00:28:23,924
The broth is to die for.
It's the best.

513
00:28:23,924 --> 00:28:25,029
- Is it?
- Yes.

514
00:28:25,053 --> 00:28:29,323
Geum Dong, you should break up
with that old bat...

515
00:28:29,323 --> 00:28:30,793
and come live with us.

516
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:33,563
I'll make kalguksu for you
all the time.

517
00:28:33,563 --> 00:28:35,253
Sure thing.

518
00:28:37,103 --> 00:28:40,103
Ji Young, how did you manage
to rent a place like this?

519
00:28:40,103 --> 00:28:41,483
I doubt you had the money.

520
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:45,424
I got it for her
with the money I had.

521
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,890
I didn't want to live
with that wicked woman.

522
00:28:48,914 --> 00:28:50,193
You, Grandma?

523
00:28:50,283 --> 00:28:52,134
Who are you calling Grandma?

524
00:28:52,414 --> 00:28:56,960
Living with that old bat
must've done a number on his head.

525
00:28:56,984 --> 00:28:58,203
Unbelievable.

526
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,293
All right.
I'll be careful from now on.

527
00:29:01,293 --> 00:29:03,374
- Let's eat.
- Sure.

528
00:29:10,734 --> 00:29:12,279
Mr. Lee, it's me.

529
00:29:12,303 --> 00:29:13,873
I'm in need of some money.

530
00:29:13,873 --> 00:29:15,073
When will I get the payment...

531
00:29:15,073 --> 00:29:17,523
from the ad campaign
Ji Young recently booked?

532
00:29:17,573 --> 00:29:20,043
The money will be wired
to Ji Young's account.

533
00:29:20,043 --> 00:29:22,460
She'll be managing her own money
from here on out.

534
00:29:22,484 --> 00:29:25,263
What are you saying? Says who?

535
00:29:25,813 --> 00:29:27,533
Didn't you and Ji Young
agree on this?

536
00:29:28,984 --> 00:29:30,174
Jae Dong, hold on.

537
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:33,524
You seem to be mistaken,

538
00:29:33,524 --> 00:29:36,713
but Ji Young's payments
should be wired to me.

539
00:29:36,823 --> 00:29:39,093
You should discuss this
with Ji Young,

540
00:29:39,093 --> 00:29:41,563
but I have to do what she says.

541
00:29:41,563 --> 00:29:43,309
What about my cut?

542
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:45,283
That should be calculated
after she's done filming the drama series.

543
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:46,723
We need money to cover her costs.

544
00:29:47,434 --> 00:29:50,049
Ms. Baek, you know
that's always the priority.

545
00:29:50,073 --> 00:29:51,444
I'm busy and should hang up.

546
00:29:51,444 --> 00:29:52,723
Jae Dong, wait.

547
00:29:54,843 --> 00:29:57,533
What has gotten into Ji Young?

548
00:29:57,643 --> 00:30:00,904
Why would she manage her income
when I'm here for her as her mom?

549
00:30:02,024 --> 00:30:03,203
She's out of her mind.

550
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:15,384
Pil Seung...

551
00:30:18,704 --> 00:30:20,183
She called me by my name.

552
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:24,394
Does Ji Young...

553
00:30:26,244 --> 00:30:27,993
remember everything?

554
00:30:40,024 --> 00:30:42,003
Ji Young, it's me.

555
00:30:43,123 --> 00:30:46,183
I'm outside where you live.
Could we meet?

556
00:30:46,833 --> 00:30:48,043
I have something to say.

557
00:30:51,734 --> 00:30:52,953
What?

558
00:30:53,734 --> 00:30:55,084
You moved?

559
00:31:17,293 --> 00:31:19,443
How come you moved out so suddenly?

560
00:31:20,264 --> 00:31:21,513
Well...

561
00:31:22,103 --> 00:31:25,114
My grandmother wasn't comfortable
at the old unit.

562
00:31:25,234 --> 00:31:28,424
It wasn't ideal for me either,
so we moved out.

563
00:31:29,543 --> 00:31:30,953
I see.

564
00:31:32,873 --> 00:31:35,834
Ji Young, how are you feeling?
Are you all right?

565
00:31:37,244 --> 00:31:39,904
Yes, I'm all right.

566
00:31:43,123 --> 00:31:45,033
I ruined filming, didn't I?

567
00:31:45,823 --> 00:31:47,243
I'm so sorry.

568
00:31:47,353 --> 00:31:49,273
It won't happen again though.

569
00:31:49,764 --> 00:31:51,144
Again, I apologize.

570
00:31:52,734 --> 00:31:54,943
It wasn't on purpose,
so don't be concerned.

571
00:31:56,133 --> 00:31:57,384
Ji Young,

572
00:31:58,303 --> 00:31:59,523
you remembered something...

573
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:03,554
at the vacation home, didn't you?

574
00:32:04,573 --> 00:32:07,564
You were once at a place
not far from where we filmed.

575
00:32:07,714 --> 00:32:09,293
I picked you up,

576
00:32:09,744 --> 00:32:10,984
and it seemed like something bad
had happened...

577
00:32:10,984 --> 00:32:12,404
seeing how you cried your eyes out.

578
00:32:13,313 --> 00:32:14,963
If you remember anything, tell me.

579
00:32:16,283 --> 00:32:18,374
What happened to you
at the vacation home?

580
00:32:22,694 --> 00:32:25,814
No, it's nothing like that.

581
00:32:30,434 --> 00:32:31,953
You didn't remember anything?

582
00:32:32,474 --> 00:32:34,523
I thought
you passed out in the woods...

583
00:32:35,103 --> 00:32:38,394
because you were overwhelmed
with past memories.

584
00:32:40,043 --> 00:32:41,324
Well...

585
00:32:43,984 --> 00:32:45,533
I'm a rookie actress,

586
00:32:46,654 --> 00:32:48,514
and this was my first time...

587
00:32:48,514 --> 00:32:52,174
filming a scene as the lead,
which probably made me nervous.

588
00:32:52,793 --> 00:32:54,273
Many people were watching,

589
00:32:55,694 --> 00:32:57,644
and the jitters got the best of me.

590
00:33:00,664 --> 00:33:02,983
I should've sent people away
after the ritual.

591
00:33:03,734 --> 00:33:05,674
Too many people
were watching us film,

592
00:33:05,674 --> 00:33:07,483
and I should've been
more considerate of you.

593
00:33:08,033 --> 00:33:09,579
That was my mistake, and I'm sorry.

594
00:33:09,603 --> 00:33:11,124
I'll book another place
for us to film.

595
00:33:14,474 --> 00:33:16,634
From that day
until this very moment,

596
00:33:18,714 --> 00:33:20,733
I've regretted
hundreds of times every day...

597
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:25,973
that I refused
to hold your hand that day.

598
00:33:27,893 --> 00:33:29,374
I've lived with regrets.

599
00:33:30,323 --> 00:33:31,543
I'm sorry.

600
00:33:31,994 --> 00:33:33,243
I really am.

601
00:33:36,434 --> 00:33:37,584
Ji Young.

602
00:33:38,363 --> 00:33:39,783
Are you all right? What's wrong?

603
00:33:42,004 --> 00:33:43,253
Gosh.

604
00:33:44,073 --> 00:33:45,453
It's nothing.

605
00:33:47,674 --> 00:33:49,834
I feel like I disappointed you.

606
00:33:53,754 --> 00:33:55,904
Get home safely, then.

607
00:34:23,444 --> 00:34:24,634
Pil Seung.

608
00:34:25,884 --> 00:34:28,034
I'm the one who was cruel to you.

609
00:34:29,424 --> 00:34:31,904
I am the one
who always stabbed you in the back.

610
00:34:34,424 --> 00:34:36,674
So why don't you resent me?

611
00:34:38,324 --> 00:34:40,543
I'm the one who wronged you,

612
00:34:41,263 --> 00:34:44,054
so why are you constantly
apologizing to me?

613
00:34:45,404 --> 00:34:46,554
Why?

614
00:35:27,013 --> 00:35:28,324
You brat!

615
00:35:30,543 --> 00:35:34,134
Why are you packing Ji Young's
and that granny's clothes?

616
00:35:35,284 --> 00:35:37,174
Gosh, Mom. Weren't you asleep?

617
00:35:37,924 --> 00:35:39,769
You know where Ji Young lives,
don't you?

618
00:35:39,793 --> 00:35:42,614
You were off to see her.
Where does she live?

619
00:35:43,263 --> 00:35:44,670
Mom, that's...

620
00:35:44,694 --> 00:35:47,043
Tell me where she moved to!

621
00:35:47,663 --> 00:35:50,163
Ji Young, look at me!

622
00:35:50,163 --> 00:35:52,184
She told me not to tell you.

623
00:35:52,274 --> 00:35:53,483
Kim Ji Young!

624
00:35:55,174 --> 00:35:56,324
My gosh.

625
00:35:56,473 --> 00:35:59,774
Ji Young, were you
at the bathhouse with her...

626
00:35:59,774 --> 00:36:00,973
after leaving me out to dry?

627
00:36:00,973 --> 00:36:02,519
You were even humming
on your way back.

628
00:36:02,543 --> 00:36:05,804
You wicked witch. How are you here?

629
00:36:07,284 --> 00:36:08,503
Do Sik.

630
00:36:08,714 --> 00:36:11,733
Ji Young, I'm really sorry,
but I had no choice.

631
00:36:12,853 --> 00:36:14,003
My gosh.

632
00:36:14,123 --> 00:36:17,543
There are three bedrooms
and two bathrooms.

633
00:36:18,723 --> 00:36:20,433
And that room over there...

634
00:36:20,433 --> 00:36:23,333
has a bed and a desk.

635
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:26,983
It is rude to look into
other people's rooms like that.

636
00:36:27,234 --> 00:36:29,623
That's Do Jun's room.

637
00:36:30,643 --> 00:36:33,023
What? Do Jun's room?

638
00:36:33,344 --> 00:36:35,523
Did you set up a room
for Do Jun as well?

639
00:36:35,884 --> 00:36:37,243
Why didn’t you ask us
to move in as well...

640
00:36:37,243 --> 00:36:39,813
when there are three bedrooms
and a living room?

641
00:36:39,813 --> 00:36:41,254
How could you do this to me?

642
00:36:41,254 --> 00:36:42,824
Let me tell you about this place.

643
00:36:42,824 --> 00:36:46,199
This unit is one I got
with my own money.

644
00:36:46,223 --> 00:36:49,223
I rented this place to live
with my granddaughter,

645
00:36:49,223 --> 00:36:51,943
so why should I live
with you as well?

646
00:36:53,234 --> 00:36:56,114
Ms. Baek, we should talk.

647
00:36:57,004 --> 00:36:59,324
Do Sik, can you
look after my grandmother?

648
00:36:59,873 --> 00:37:03,074
Grandma, watch TV with Do Sik.

649
00:37:03,074 --> 00:37:05,824
- Sure thing.
- Come on.

650
00:37:11,013 --> 00:37:15,034
Ji Young, how can you
leave your own mom out to dry...

651
00:37:15,353 --> 00:37:17,773
and live with a woman
who isn't even family?

652
00:37:18,654 --> 00:37:20,493
My grandma is my family.

653
00:37:20,493 --> 00:37:21,773
She's my grandmother.

654
00:37:23,393 --> 00:37:25,393
Ji Young, I know
you don't remember this,

655
00:37:25,393 --> 00:37:26,734
but when you were Do Ra,

656
00:37:26,734 --> 00:37:28,833
you always put me first.

657
00:37:28,833 --> 00:37:31,184
I'm all that mattered to you.

658
00:37:31,534 --> 00:37:35,054
Ji Young, you'll regret this
once you regain your memories.

659
00:37:35,574 --> 00:37:37,643
That's why
you should live with all of us.

660
00:37:37,643 --> 00:37:40,574
It'll help us grow closer
and help you regain your memories.

661
00:37:40,574 --> 00:37:42,893
No, I don't want that.

662
00:37:43,284 --> 00:37:45,733
What? Why not?

663
00:37:46,284 --> 00:37:48,503
My grandmother isn't fond of you,

664
00:37:48,884 --> 00:37:50,324
and I find you uncomfortable...

665
00:37:50,324 --> 00:37:53,404
because I don't remember
who you are to me.

666
00:37:54,024 --> 00:37:55,273
So,

667
00:37:55,493 --> 00:37:58,273
it seems better
to live apart for now.

668
00:37:59,833 --> 00:38:00,964
Know that and leave.

669
00:38:00,964 --> 00:38:02,634
Ji Young, wait.

670
00:38:02,634 --> 00:38:06,123
Then at least tell Jae Dong
to have the payments made to you...

671
00:38:06,674 --> 00:38:09,654
be wired into my account again.

672
00:38:10,243 --> 00:38:12,074
I should manage your money.

673
00:38:12,074 --> 00:38:14,963
You'll be too busy
to do it yourself.

674
00:38:15,313 --> 00:38:16,563
Why?

675
00:38:16,743 --> 00:38:18,693
Why should you manage
the money I earn, lady?

676
00:38:19,654 --> 00:38:22,924
I'm your mother,
not some random lady!

677
00:38:22,924 --> 00:38:24,534
I'm an adult...

678
00:38:25,353 --> 00:38:27,704
and should manage the money I earn,

679
00:38:28,453 --> 00:38:29,614
so what's your problem?

680
00:38:30,194 --> 00:38:33,083
You! You evil stepmom.

681
00:38:33,464 --> 00:38:34,663
How dare you?

682
00:38:34,663 --> 00:38:38,083
Who are you to manage
the money my Ji Young earns?

683
00:38:38,333 --> 00:38:40,973
It's not like you and Ji Young...

684
00:38:40,973 --> 00:38:43,253
are related by blood.

685
00:38:43,543 --> 00:38:46,313
Get out of my house this instant!

686
00:38:46,313 --> 00:38:49,583
Stay out of this, Granny.
Who are you to butt in?

687
00:38:49,583 --> 00:38:51,183
What? Why you...

688
00:38:51,183 --> 00:38:52,614
- Leave!
- My gosh.

689
00:38:52,614 --> 00:38:55,284
- Get lost!
- Mom, please don't.

690
00:38:55,284 --> 00:38:57,534
- Mom, stop it.
- What's the matter with you?

691
00:38:57,683 --> 00:38:58,953
- Ji Young.
- Mom, you're leaving!

692
00:38:58,953 --> 00:39:00,594
How could you do this to me?

693
00:39:00,594 --> 00:39:02,324
- Ji Young, you can't...
- Mom, come on.

694
00:39:02,324 --> 00:39:03,563
- Get lost!
- Ji Young!

695
00:39:03,563 --> 00:39:05,123
- Get out.
- Let go of me.

696
00:39:05,123 --> 00:39:07,163
- Get lost.
- Let go!

697
00:39:07,163 --> 00:39:09,413
Let go! You brat!

698
00:39:12,973 --> 00:39:15,103
Let go of me.

699
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:17,074
Ji Young is out of her mind.

700
00:39:17,074 --> 00:39:18,844
How could she do this
to her own mom?

701
00:39:18,844 --> 00:39:20,574
I don't care
if she doesn't remember.

702
00:39:20,574 --> 00:39:21,614
She's treating us
like we're strangers.

703
00:39:21,614 --> 00:39:23,793
Mom, cut it out!

704
00:39:24,743 --> 00:39:27,063
Let Ji Young do
what she wants this time.

705
00:39:29,123 --> 00:39:31,284
We appeared out of nowhere
claiming to be her family,

706
00:39:31,284 --> 00:39:32,793
but she had to pay my settlement
due to an assault charge...

707
00:39:32,793 --> 00:39:34,393
and then cover your debt
with the loan sharks.

708
00:39:34,393 --> 00:39:36,269
Even I would want
to leave us behind.

709
00:39:36,293 --> 00:39:38,824
I completely understand
why she's doing this.

710
00:39:38,824 --> 00:39:40,864
But still,

711
00:39:40,864 --> 00:39:42,063
how can she live with a stranger...

712
00:39:42,063 --> 00:39:43,833
and leave her own mom hanging?

713
00:39:43,833 --> 00:39:45,353
Does this make sense to you?

714
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:48,079
On top of that,

715
00:39:48,103 --> 00:39:51,074
she wants to manage her own money.

716
00:39:51,074 --> 00:39:52,444
How will we make ends meet now?

717
00:39:52,444 --> 00:39:54,264
When are we ever
going to buy a house?

718
00:39:54,543 --> 00:39:58,284
Do Sik, talk to Ji Young
and convince her...

719
00:39:58,284 --> 00:40:01,163
to let me manage her money again.

720
00:40:02,154 --> 00:40:03,333
Mom, please.

721
00:40:04,754 --> 00:40:06,993
I'll earn what I can
and buy us a house,

722
00:40:06,993 --> 00:40:08,123
so let's go.

723
00:40:08,123 --> 00:40:10,273
Stop bothering Ji Young and go!

724
00:40:10,364 --> 00:40:11,864
- When will you do that?
- Come on.

725
00:40:11,864 --> 00:40:13,063
When will you be able
to buy a house?

726
00:40:13,063 --> 00:40:15,294
- I'll take care of it.
- You brat!

(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

728
00:40:27,169 --> 00:40:29,339
("Seoul Lady")

729
00:40:40,419 --> 00:40:41,560
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

730
00:40:45,629 --> 00:40:49,300
Ji Young, may I come in?

731
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:54,105
Grandma,
you're back to your old self.

732
00:40:54,129 --> 00:40:55,869
Yes, I am.

733
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,469
That's why I'm in a bit of a hurry.

734
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:02,509
You're in a hurry?
What does that mean?

735
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,009
Here. Take it.

736
00:41:05,479 --> 00:41:08,320
This is yours,
so spend it when you want to.

737
00:41:08,649 --> 00:41:12,096
What's this, and why is it mine?

738
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:15,490
Whenever I was lucid,

739
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:19,329
I gathered the money from selling
the house, restaurant, and land...

740
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:21,500
into this account.

741
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,860
What...

742
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,529
Why on earth
would you give that to me?

743
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,800
Who else should I give it to?

744
00:41:29,799 --> 00:41:31,199
Grandma...

745
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:33,509
I wanted you...

746
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:36,739
to have this for a while now.

747
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,609
But I haven't been
able to stay lucid...

748
00:41:39,609 --> 00:41:41,049
for long periods of time,

749
00:41:41,049 --> 00:41:43,220
so I completely forgot about it.

750
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:46,650
That's why it took me a while
to get this to you.

751
00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:51,259
You should be glad though.

752
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:55,459
It's a miracle
I didn't throw this in the garbage.

753
00:41:55,459 --> 00:41:56,900
Right?

754
00:41:57,330 --> 00:42:01,329
So take it, okay?

755
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,710
From here on out,

756
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:10,210
I'll only be losing my mind
more frequently.

757
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,479
When that day comes,

758
00:42:13,479 --> 00:42:17,480
I might throw this in the garbage
or do worse.

759
00:42:17,779 --> 00:42:19,219
Don't you agree?

760
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:21,520
Grandma...

761
00:42:22,359 --> 00:42:25,529
Gosh, why are you crying?

762
00:42:25,529 --> 00:42:27,659
Unbelievable.

763
00:42:27,859 --> 00:42:31,500
My sweet puppy.

764
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,000
Don't cry.

765
00:42:34,669 --> 00:42:36,000
Gosh.

766
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:40,940
Anyway, I wanted to talk...

767
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,610
about that Gong person.

768
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:48,419
From what I gather,

769
00:42:48,419 --> 00:42:52,219
you've been dating him
because you owe him money.

770
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,259
Ji Young, don't do that.

771
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,659
Pay him back that money first.

772
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:02,105
Got it?

773
00:43:02,129 --> 00:43:05,329
Dating someone
you don't have feelings for?

774
00:43:05,529 --> 00:43:09,400
Nothing brings down your spirit
more than that.

775
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:14,440
Goodness me.

776
00:43:15,939 --> 00:43:17,839
Thank you, Grandma.

777
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:21,849
My gosh. My poor baby.

778
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:25,449
What? Ji Young moved out?

779
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,320
She'll only be living
with that grandma from now on.

780
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:31,160
I get it.

781
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,130
It wasn't ideal for all of you
to live in this tiny unit.

782
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:35,959
I was wondering
why she was living with you...

783
00:43:35,959 --> 00:43:37,730
when you two weren't family.

784
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:40,899
By the way,
how could she move...

785
00:43:40,899 --> 00:43:43,000
without even telling her boyfriend?

786
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,639
She hasn't been taking my calls
and has been ignoring my texts.

787
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,480
Ms. Baek.

788
00:43:48,779 --> 00:43:50,610
Where's her new place?

789
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:56,880
Hey.

790
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:59,290
Speak of the devil.

791
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:02,159
What is it? Did she text you?

792
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:05,529
Mr. Gong, text me
your bank account number.

793
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:09,259
What? My bank account number?

794
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,130
Why does she suddenly want
my bank account number?

795
00:44:13,569 --> 00:44:17,270
Is Ji Young asking
for your bank account number?

796
00:44:23,279 --> 00:44:24,840
Why?

797
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,909
To pay back
the remaining 300,000 dollars.

798
00:44:31,049 --> 00:44:33,020
She wants to pay back
the 300,000 dollars.

799
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:37,290
Why is she paying back
the money I gave you?

800
00:44:38,859 --> 00:44:40,230
What was that?

801
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,170
We should meet.
We'll talk face to face.

802
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:48,500
Where should we meet?

803
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,009
Mr. Gong, where...

804
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,025
What a rude jerk.

805
00:44:58,049 --> 00:44:59,679
He left without even saying goodbye.

806
00:45:00,979 --> 00:45:02,880
What was all that about?

807
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,880
Ji Young has 300,000 dollars?

808
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:09,619
Where did she get that much money?

809
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:18,599
Hey, Jae Dong.

810
00:45:18,729 --> 00:45:22,240
Did Ji Young get
the rest of her pay already?

811
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,846
What do you mean?
We just started shooting.

812
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:26,716
She'll get the other 50 percent
much later.

813
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:28,286
Yes, right?

814
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:31,079
Did she get paid
for signing a commercial deal?

815
00:45:31,109 --> 00:45:32,950
Not yet. Why do you ask?

816
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:35,779
No, it's nothing at all. Bye.

817
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,949
Did she win the lottery, then?

818
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,065
Why would she return 300,000 dollars
that he didn't even ask for?

819
00:45:43,089 --> 00:45:45,590
She must've lost her mind.

820
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:48,130
She ditched her mom
and then went and did that.

821
00:45:49,399 --> 00:45:51,869
She's out of her mind.

822
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,369
I just don't get it.

823
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:01,909
Ji Young, why do you want
to return that money?

824
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:05,650
Yes, I did invest because of you,

825
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:09,920
but I gave the money to Ms. Baek,
to be exact.

826
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,826
I told you last time
that that matter was for me...

827
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:15,860
to hash out with her.

828
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:19,730
So Mr. Gong,
give me your account details.

829
00:46:23,229 --> 00:46:24,529
Ji Young.

830
00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:29,840
You and I shouldn't talk
about money or investments.

831
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:32,909
Let's just talk about us.

832
00:46:33,009 --> 00:46:36,639
Aren't there many fun things
to talk about?

833
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:41,820
- Mr. Gong.
- The truth is,

834
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:43,550
on the day of your first shoot,

835
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,866
I prepared something for you
that was...

836
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:49,020
way more extravagant than this.

837
00:46:49,459 --> 00:46:53,090
I had to cancel everything
because you passed out.

838
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:57,329
However, despite that...

839
00:47:00,029 --> 00:47:01,670
Ta-da.

840
00:47:01,899 --> 00:47:04,369
I still have this.

841
00:47:05,109 --> 00:47:08,109
- What's that?
- To celebrate your first lead role,

842
00:47:08,109 --> 00:47:10,380
I got this to show how I felt.

843
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,980
Let our love be forever.

844
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:21,190
They say that people never change.

845
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:24,559
Then and even now,

846
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:28,200
he's still trying to win me over
by flashing his money.

847
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,730
- I'll help you put it on.
- No, Mr. Gong.

848
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,500
This is too much for me.

849
00:47:33,529 --> 00:47:35,699
I didn't come here to accept a gift.

850
00:47:37,799 --> 00:47:40,746
Ji Young. You won't accept my gift,

851
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:44,179
and you want to return the money
I invested in Ms. Baek?

852
00:47:45,109 --> 00:47:46,849
What am I to you?

853
00:47:47,609 --> 00:47:49,179
Aren't I your boyfriend?

854
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:52,250
Ji Young. Other women...

855
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:54,795
would do anything
to get something like this.

856
00:47:54,819 --> 00:47:57,219
They can't get enough of such gifts.

857
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:07,645
Tae Hee.

858
00:48:07,669 --> 00:48:09,040
Gong Jin Dan.

859
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,139
How can you do this
when we set a date for our wedding?

860
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,610
I hate myself for giving you...

861
00:48:16,879 --> 00:48:18,509
the benefit of the doubt.

862
00:48:18,879 --> 00:48:20,179
Tae Hee!

863
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,190
Tae Hee!

864
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:46,710
Tae Hee.

865
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:49,710
You got everything wrong.
Hear me out.

866
00:48:52,509 --> 00:48:54,409
What? I got it wrong?

867
00:48:54,979 --> 00:48:57,179
I misheard
"let our love be forever?"

868
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,020
- Tae Hee.
- Gong Jin Dan.

869
00:49:01,089 --> 00:49:03,759
Our engagement
and business deal is over.

870
00:49:03,959 --> 00:49:07,960
So don't be so crass
and cling to me.

871
00:49:10,899 --> 00:49:12,270
Tae Hee!

872
00:49:23,879 --> 00:49:27,449
I mean,
she had to hear that of all things?

873
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:31,250
Darn it. What should I do now?

874
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,949
Oh, shoot.

875
00:49:34,419 --> 00:49:36,959
What on earth is happening?

876
00:49:36,959 --> 00:49:39,290
- What's wrong, Auntie?
- Oh, dear.

877
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:42,335
- What's going on?
- I'm home.

878
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:45,529
Hey, you. Gong Jin Dan.

879
00:49:46,299 --> 00:49:49,800
Did Tae Hee really catch you
with another woman?

880
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,470
So she broke it off with you?

881
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:54,286
What did you just say?

882
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:55,855
She broke it off?

883
00:49:55,879 --> 00:49:57,409
My gosh. Jin Dan.

884
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:00,380
Mom. Auntie.

885
00:50:00,649 --> 00:50:02,850
It's not like that.

886
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:04,826
How is it not like that?

887
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:08,196
Her family called me
and officially ended the engagement.

888
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:11,759
Oh, no. Is that true, Jin Dan?

889
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:14,960
- Who ended the engagement?
- Goodness.

890
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:18,005
Do you mean the Illyu Foods family?

891
00:50:18,029 --> 00:50:19,676
Yes.

892
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:22,540
Jin Dan went
and did something stupid...

893
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:25,369
and gave some other woman
a diamond something.

894
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:29,056
Tae Hee saw it with her own eyes.

895
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:31,139
What?

896
00:50:31,279 --> 00:50:34,625
I'm too ashamed
to show myself in public now.

897
00:50:34,649 --> 00:50:36,656
I warned you, you fool.

898
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:39,050
To break up with them properly
when you date someone.

899
00:50:39,189 --> 00:50:42,489
I told you not to see multiple women
and do what was right.

900
00:50:42,589 --> 00:50:44,320
And you're still messed up?

901
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:48,659
Jin Taek. Auntie.

902
00:50:48,729 --> 00:50:51,976
I wasn't dating the woman
Tae Hee saw me with.

903
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,029
She was a VIP client
of Angel Investment,

904
00:50:55,029 --> 00:50:56,315
so I gave her a gift.

905
00:50:56,339 --> 00:50:58,370
To maintain a good relationship.

906
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:01,139
Keep your mouth shut!

907
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:02,656
Would Tae Hee call off
her own wedding...

908
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:05,849
because she couldn't tell
the difference?

909
00:51:06,479 --> 00:51:09,295
Chairman Gong. He's too far gone.

910
00:51:09,319 --> 00:51:13,719
I don't think
he'll ever amount to anything.

911
00:51:13,819 --> 00:51:17,119
Auntie. How could you
say something like that?

912
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,189
Didn't I tell you...

913
00:51:18,189 --> 00:51:21,636
the overseas property market
was going downhill?

914
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:23,136
How are you going to correct this?

915
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:25,329
How will you make up
for this huge loss?

916
00:51:26,029 --> 00:51:28,540
Honey. Relax and talk it out calmly.

917
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:31,900
What are you talking about?

918
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:35,480
Did Jin Dan lose more money
on a business deal?

919
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:39,480
Auntie. I said I'd adopt Jin Dan.

920
00:51:39,609 --> 00:51:41,509
I take it back right now.

921
00:51:41,509 --> 00:51:45,696
Chairman Gong, you can't
change your mind just like that.

922
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,735
He couldn't even keep a promise
he made with two families.

923
00:51:48,759 --> 00:51:50,220
He even caused a huge loss
to the company...

924
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:51,906
because he couldn't run it.

925
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:54,966
I can't rely on or trust
this incompetent fool.

926
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:57,129
How could I leave him in charge
of our household and group?

927
00:51:57,129 --> 00:51:58,600
Oh, goodness.

928
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,670
I must've been out of my mind
for a while.

929
00:52:01,799 --> 00:52:05,710
Yes, Chairman Gong.
You made the right call. Do that.

930
00:52:06,339 --> 00:52:07,809
You pathetic fool.

931
00:52:07,939 --> 00:52:09,415
You mindless punk.

932
00:52:09,439 --> 00:52:10,739
My gosh.

933
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:15,220
Auntie. How could you
go against him too?

934
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:16,779
That's not fair.

935
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:20,250
You couldn't even make use of
the opportunity you were spoon-fed.

936
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:24,020
I'm sick and tired of your son now.

937
00:52:24,589 --> 00:52:25,960
Goodness.

938
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:38,346
What is this about now?

939
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:40,045
Ji Young.

940
00:52:40,069 --> 00:52:42,639
Did you tell Mr. Gong
you'd return his 300,000 dollars?

941
00:52:42,979 --> 00:52:44,840
Where did you get the money?

942
00:52:46,479 --> 00:52:48,179
From my grandma.

943
00:52:49,649 --> 00:52:51,079
Your grandma?

944
00:52:52,350 --> 00:52:53,650
Ji Young.

945
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:56,460
If you had that much money,

946
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,589
you should've given it to me,

947
00:52:58,589 --> 00:53:00,406
so I could pay Mr. Gong back
or get a bigger place.

948
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:04,300
How could you do this on your own
without a word to me?

949
00:53:04,359 --> 00:53:05,869
What do you mean?

950
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:09,199
Why should I give you
that much money?

951
00:53:09,939 --> 00:53:13,415
Ji Young.
That's what you always did.

952
00:53:13,439 --> 00:53:17,286
You gave me, your mom,
every cent you made.

953
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:21,025
You should've given me
any money you had.

954
00:53:21,049 --> 00:53:24,579
Did you think
I'd do something with it?

955
00:53:26,419 --> 00:53:27,750
That's why...

956
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:31,119
That's why we lost everything.

957
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,489
That's why I died.

958
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:37,059
For trusting you.

959
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,570
Ms. Baek.

960
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,346
Because of
your 500,000-dollar private loan,

961
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:49,579
I dated Mr. Gong

962
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,125
To pay it back,

963
00:53:53,149 --> 00:53:55,125
I bowed and groveled
to get paid in advance,

964
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:57,349
and I asked everyone
I knew for help.

965
00:53:58,279 --> 00:54:00,889
So why do you
keep asking me for money?

966
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,860
Did you leave me your savings?

967
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,090
Why should I give you money?

968
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:12,369
Ji Young! How can you do this
to your own mom?

969
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:15,500
I live in a one-room shack,
and you live in a fancy apartment.

970
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,946
Don't you feel sorry for me?

971
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:19,570
How could you?

972
00:54:19,939 --> 00:54:22,479
How could you of all people do this?

973
00:54:22,479 --> 00:54:23,779
After...

974
00:54:24,509 --> 00:54:26,979
After all I did to look after you
after your dad died,

975
00:54:26,979 --> 00:54:29,579
you can't do this to me. You can't.

976
00:54:29,649 --> 00:54:32,020
- Ji Young, you...
- You evil witch.

977
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,520
Oh, my gosh.

978
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:37,235
How are you my Ji Young's mom?

979
00:54:37,259 --> 00:54:40,165
You are her stepmom.

980
00:54:40,189 --> 00:54:42,406
You do nothing but torment her.

981
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:44,560
- Get out of here. Leave right now.
- Oh, my gosh!

982
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:47,669
- Get out. Leave!
- Oh, gosh. Save me!

983
00:54:47,669 --> 00:54:51,599
- How dare you come here?
- What got into you? Stop!

984
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:53,309
Darn her.

985
00:54:54,569 --> 00:54:55,880
Oh, my goodness.

986
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:01,550
What's with Ji Young?

987
00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:03,679
What happened to my daughter?

988
00:55:04,479 --> 00:55:06,449
When she was Do Ra,

989
00:55:06,549 --> 00:55:08,660
she was such a devoted daughter.

990
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:10,690
What's gotten into her?

991
00:55:11,589 --> 00:55:15,290
When will Ji Young
regain her memories?

992
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:17,230
What's wrong with her?

993
00:55:18,259 --> 00:55:21,730
My gosh. Oh, dear.

994
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:30,279
Many people play golf at parks
like that these days.

995
00:55:30,279 --> 00:55:34,349
So I'm thinking of having
a promotional event at the store.

996
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:38,520
I like the proposal.

997
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:40,619
You should go ahead with it.

998
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:43,389
Okay. I will, Chairman Gong.

999
00:55:46,959 --> 00:55:48,590
My gosh.

1001
00:55:52,169 --> 00:55:54,219
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Enjoy.

1002
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:56,150
Please wrap this up.

1003
00:55:56,799 --> 00:56:00,259
We have gifts
for those who buy our new products.

1004
00:56:01,439 --> 00:56:02,659
My gosh.

1005
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:05,330
I like the outfit she's wearing.

1006
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:07,400
It's pretty, isn't it?

1007
00:56:07,709 --> 00:56:09,699
This is our new product.

1008
00:56:10,149 --> 00:56:12,699
I think it will look great
on you too.

1010
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:19,409
You're here.

1011
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:21,189
How is the event going?

1012
00:56:21,189 --> 00:56:23,029
It's going really well.

1013
00:56:23,029 --> 00:56:24,509
The customers like it.

1014
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:27,299
You did well.

1015
00:56:27,299 --> 00:56:28,989
Why don't we go out for dinner
before going home?

1016
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,290
Sounds great.

1017
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,549
You looked great today.

1018
00:56:39,549 --> 00:56:41,759

What do you want to eat?

1021
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:47,640
Why don't we go and watch
a musical after dinner?

1022
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:49,710
I'd love that.

1023

near the theater.

1024

What musical do you want to watch?

1026
00:56:58,259 --> 00:57:01,379
I'm okay with anything
as long as you are there.

1027
00:57:24,189 --> 00:57:26,879
Chairman Gong,
are you feeling better?

1028
00:57:28,529 --> 00:57:29,810
Soo Yeon.

1029
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:33,049
Where is my wife?

1030
00:57:34,129 --> 00:57:35,480
She's next to you.

1031

She's about to wake up now.

1032
00:57:45,609 --> 00:57:46,799
Honey.

1033
00:57:48,919 --> 00:57:50,170
Are you all right?

1034
00:57:52,419 --> 00:57:53,699
Yes.

1035
00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:55,569
What about you?

1036
00:57:57,089 --> 00:57:58,469
I'm fine.

1037
00:58:02,229 --> 00:58:03,480
Doctor.

1038
00:58:04,459 --> 00:58:05,879
Are you sure...

1039
00:58:06,529 --> 00:58:08,279
my wife is okay?

1040
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:11,500
Yes. We ran some tests,

1041
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:13,989
and fortunately,
we didn't find anything wrong.

1042
00:58:14,810 --> 00:58:16,790
It's a relief
that it wasn't a serious accident.

1043
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:20,726
Please get some rest
while being on an IV.

1044
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:22,230
Then you'll be able to go home.

1045
00:58:23,279 --> 00:58:24,500
All right then.

1046
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:32,580
Honey.

1047
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:34,480
It was a miracle...

1048
00:58:35,029 --> 00:58:36,810
we weren't seriously hurt.

1049
00:58:57,549 --> 00:59:00,520
Honey, what's wrong?
Are you all right?

1050
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:01,870
Is everything okay?

1051
00:59:01,919 --> 00:59:03,440
Do you need to see a doctor again?

1052
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:05,469
No.

1053
00:59:06,229 --> 00:59:07,710
That's not it.

1054
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,879
To be honest,
at the moment of the accident,

1055
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:15,650
all I could think of was our Ma Ri.

1056
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:21,890
If something bad happened
to you and me,

1057
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,799
what would happen to Ma Ri?

1058
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:30,620
Honey, nothing bad happened to us.

1059
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:32,299
Why would you think that?

1060
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:34,569
No.

1061
00:59:35,189 --> 00:59:37,670
We never know
what will happen in life.

1062
00:59:38,890 --> 00:59:40,339
And we're not getting any younger.

1063
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:43,779
We were lucky today,

1064
00:59:46,029 --> 00:59:47,350
but...

1065
00:59:47,399 --> 00:59:50,319
what if we get into
a big accident or something?

1066
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:55,020
What would happen
to Ma Ri and our family?

1067
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:58,989
I felt like
the world was coming to an end.

1068
00:59:59,779 --> 01:00:01,209
You don't have to worry
about something that didn't happen.

1069
01:00:01,209 --> 01:00:03,029
We can prepare for the future.

1070
01:00:03,919 --> 01:00:05,469
How would we be prepared?

1071
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:09,210
There's no one who can protect
our company and Ma Ri.

1072
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:15,060
Then we should start...

1073
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:17,480
looking for someone nice
for Ma Ri again.

1074
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,480
No.

1075
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:22,850
Like Auntie said,

1076
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:27,190
we can't just trust anyone.

1077
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:30,029
And we did try to find someone.

1078
01:00:30,339 --> 01:00:31,890
It wasn't as easy as we thought.

1079
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:37,770
Honey.

1080
01:00:39,390 --> 01:00:40,699
Actually,

1081
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:43,940
the moment the accident happened,

1082
01:00:46,229 --> 01:00:47,679
do you know who came to my mind?

1083
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:50,779
Who?

1084
01:00:51,959 --> 01:00:54,520
It wasn't even Auntie or Jin Dan.

1085
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:59,319
Pil Seung came to my mind.

1086
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:04,129
The person
who will be by Ma Ri's side.

1087
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:07,429
Pil Seung is the only person.

1088
01:01:08,609 --> 01:01:09,870
Honey.

1089
01:01:10,979 --> 01:01:12,969
What are you talking about?

1090
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:16,839
Pil Seung is Ma Ri's brother.

1091
01:01:18,589 --> 01:01:20,009
And he's your son.

1092
01:01:22,399 --> 01:01:24,580
Your son is my son too.

1093
01:01:29,399 --> 01:01:30,620
Honey...

1094
01:01:38,509 --> 01:01:39,699
Ji Young.

1095
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:44,170
What does this all mean?

1096
01:01:46,049 --> 01:01:47,270
I brought the necklace...

1097
01:01:48,390 --> 01:01:51,339
because you were in a rush
and left it behind that day.

1098
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:53,609
And this envelope...

1099
01:01:55,930 --> 01:01:57,109
is 300,000 dollars.

1100
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:58,650
So what?

1101
01:01:59,899 --> 01:02:02,020
Are you giving me this money
to end things with me?

1102
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:03,850
Mr. Gong.

1103
01:02:04,839 --> 01:02:06,390
This is the right thing to do.

1104
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:09,609
You can't be doing this to me
while seeing someone else.

1105
01:02:09,609 --> 01:02:11,290
It's just ridiculous.

1106
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:14,960
I decided to date you
because I thought you broke up with her.

1107
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:18,569
This is it...

1108
01:02:24,759 --> 01:02:26,109
for us.

1109
01:02:30,430 --> 01:02:31,650
Hey, Kim Ji Young.

1110
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:33,549
Ji Young.

1111
01:02:34,299 --> 01:02:35,750
Why are you doing this to me?

1112
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,520
I ended things with her.

1113
01:02:39,169 --> 01:02:41,890
I lost everything I had
because of you.

1114
01:02:42,609 --> 01:02:44,180
The engagement was called off
that day.

1115
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:45,779
So things were crazy at my house.

1116
01:02:45,779 --> 01:02:46,960
Anyway,

1117
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:49,699
my final choice is you.

1118
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:54,600
What Tae Hee and I had between us
was a marriage of convenience.

1119
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:57,839
You were always the one
whom I had feelings for.

1120
01:02:59,089 --> 01:03:00,235
I'm serious.

1121
01:03:00,259 --> 01:03:02,440
You are lying through your teeth.

1122
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:06,219
I should get going then.

1123
01:03:17,479 --> 01:03:18,629
What?

1124
01:03:18,939 --> 01:03:21,060
I'm lying through my teeth?

1125
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:26,900
By the way,

1126
01:03:28,850 --> 01:03:31,170
without the accent,

1127
01:03:32,290 --> 01:03:33,839
she looks like a different person.

1128
01:03:34,290 --> 01:03:35,480
She sounds sophisticated.

1129
01:03:38,330 --> 01:03:39,980
Is she the Kim Ji Young I know?

1130
01:03:48,339 --> 01:03:50,458
(Cashier's Check)

1131
01:03:54,109 --> 01:03:55,779
She just found...

1132
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:58,679
the right time to break up with me.

1133
01:04:01,850 --> 01:04:03,259
By the way,

1134
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:05,860
how did Ji Young...

1135
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:08,730
come up with such a big sum of money
all of a sudden?

1136
01:04:14,788 --> 01:04:16,119
Was it...

1137
01:04:19,716 --> 01:04:21,197
No way.

1138
01:04:27,716 --> 01:04:29,087
Hey, Ko Pil Seung.

1139
01:04:29,926 --> 01:04:32,487
You didn't become the CEO to spend
your money on things like this.

1140
01:04:32,727 --> 01:04:34,556
You should talk to me in words
I can understand.

1141
01:04:34,756 --> 01:04:35,926
Be more specific.

1142
01:04:35,926 --> 01:04:37,596
This money, 300,000 dollars.

1143
01:04:40,466 --> 01:04:42,567
So are you going to play dumb?

1144
01:04:43,537 --> 01:04:46,206
You gave the money
to Ji Young, right?

1145
01:04:46,836 --> 01:04:49,777
You told her to break up with me
with this money!

1146
01:04:50,446 --> 01:04:52,246
Did you think I wouldn't know?

1147
01:04:59,247 --> 01:05:00,786
What did you just say?

1148
01:05:01,486 --> 01:05:03,726
Are you saying
Ms. Kim has been dating you...

1149
01:05:05,457 --> 01:05:07,627
because she owed you money?

1150
01:05:08,924 --> 01:05:11,831
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1151
01:05:44,057 --> 01:05:46,351
Gosh, what's happening?

1152
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:48,351
The chairman of APP Group...

1153
01:05:48,375 --> 01:05:51,375
hopes for an amicable relationship
as if we were one big family.

1154
01:05:51,375 --> 01:05:54,121
You were at Sun Young's house?

1155
01:05:54,145 --> 01:05:55,815
Why did you go there
without telling me?

1156
01:05:55,815 --> 01:05:58,791
Mr. Gong paid off the money
Ms. Baek owed to some loan sharks?

1157
01:05:58,815 --> 01:06:01,902
For lending that wicked witch...

1158
01:06:01,926 --> 01:06:03,802
the money she needed,

1159
01:06:03,826 --> 01:06:06,766
he requested a relationship
with Ji Young.

1160
01:06:06,766 --> 01:06:08,466
I will never regain my memories...

1161
01:06:08,466 --> 01:06:10,736
or will I ever go back to you,

1162
01:06:10,736 --> 01:06:12,096
so don't wait for me anymore.

1163
01:06:12,096 --> 01:06:13,742
I don't care if you don't love me...

1164
01:06:13,766 --> 01:06:15,235
because I love you a lot.

1165
01:06:15,306 --> 01:06:16,851
That's why I want to protect you.

1166
01:06:17,547 --> 01:06:18,927
