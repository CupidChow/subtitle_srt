(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:09,198 --> 00:00:10,349
Look at this photo.

3
00:00:10,428 --> 00:00:11,439
(Episode 37)

4
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:14,389
Doesn't he look just like my father
in his youth?

5
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:16,719
So I found it very strange.

6
00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:19,258
What are you talking about?

7
00:00:19,878 --> 00:00:21,029
Ae Kyo.

8
00:00:21,608 --> 00:00:23,958
Do you remember the breakup trip
we went on for the last time?

9
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:25,898
So I was wondering...

10
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:28,999
(Special Interview with CEO Gong
of Angel Investment Corp.)

11
00:00:30,919 --> 00:00:32,339
Isn't he my son?

12
00:00:33,618 --> 00:00:36,539
Sang Gu, what are you talking about?

13
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:38,109
Mom.

14
00:00:40,429 --> 00:00:42,678
Jin Dan.

15
00:00:43,069 --> 00:00:44,418
What are you doing here?

16
00:00:45,668 --> 00:00:47,388
What brings you here?

17
00:00:50,268 --> 00:00:52,288
Who's that man?

18
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:55,055
Why were you two sitting together
being an eyesore?

19
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,555
What?

20
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,749
My mom... I mean, he's the son
of your grandmother's friend.

21
00:00:59,749 --> 00:01:01,889
He wanted me to take out
an insurance policy,

22
00:01:01,889 --> 00:01:03,238
so I was listening to the terms.

23
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,789
Why was he sitting
right next to you though?

24
00:01:05,789 --> 00:01:06,939
It made me recoil.

25
00:01:12,728 --> 00:01:15,449
He looks like a womanizer as well.

26
00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:18,649
Take one out for him
and tell him to stay away.

27
00:01:19,069 --> 00:01:21,769
Just his looks disgust me. Got it?

28
00:01:21,769 --> 00:01:23,319
Right. Sure thing.

29
00:01:23,739 --> 00:01:26,078
You shouldn't keep
your people waiting.

30
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:27,128
Sure.

31
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:28,628
Get going.

32
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:39,569
Sang Gu.

33
00:01:39,858 --> 00:01:42,078
What did you mean by that just now?

34
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:45,198
What about my Jin Dan?
Do you think he's your son?

35
00:01:45,198 --> 00:01:46,679
As if that makes sense.

36
00:01:46,728 --> 00:01:48,968
I was only raising a question.

37
00:01:48,968 --> 00:01:50,778
That's just absurd.

38
00:01:51,368 --> 00:01:53,018
It makes no sense at all.

39
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:55,489
What if my Jin Dan had heard you?

40
00:01:56,868 --> 00:01:58,059
Sorry about that.

41
00:01:58,638 --> 00:02:00,578
If he had been my son,

42
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,679
you would've told me so.

43
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:04,798
Of course.
As if you need to say that.

44
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:06,569
Gosh, you startled me.

45
00:02:07,778 --> 00:02:08,839
Ae Kyo.

46
00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:11,959
Your son grew up
to be a fine young man.

47
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:13,768
I'm impressed.

48
00:02:14,418 --> 00:02:17,228
Even I must admit
that he's a fine young man.

49
00:02:17,228 --> 00:02:18,958
That must be because he's your son.

50
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:21,179
He's an impressive young man
in my eyes.

51
00:02:22,228 --> 00:02:23,579
Thanks.

52
00:02:24,499 --> 00:02:25,649
Right.

53
00:02:26,138 --> 00:02:28,708
I'm glad he isn't my son though.

54
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:30,168
He's better off having...

55
00:02:30,168 --> 00:02:32,429
the late Chairman Gong
for a father anyway.

56
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,379
Sang Gu, why are we
still on the subject?

57
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:37,078
You're upsetting me.

58
00:02:37,078 --> 00:02:39,628
Got it. Sorry about that.

59
00:03:01,198 --> 00:03:03,459
Do you remember the breakup trip
we went on for the last time?

60
00:03:04,168 --> 00:03:05,359
So I was wondering...

61
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:10,929
Isn't he my son?

62
00:03:13,948 --> 00:03:16,769
Why would Sang Gu say that
and put doubt in my head?

63
00:03:18,018 --> 00:03:21,609
Jin Dan takes after the chairman.
How dare he?

64
00:03:33,298 --> 00:03:35,758
Why do they not seem alike anymore?

65
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:39,059
He's wrong.

66
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:42,359
Jin Dan is the late chairman's son.

67
00:03:50,888 --> 00:03:52,008
Goodness.

68
00:03:52,888 --> 00:03:54,038
Oh, no.

69
00:03:55,728 --> 00:03:57,038
That can't be.

70
00:03:57,728 --> 00:03:58,908
No way.

71
00:04:01,668 --> 00:04:04,049
Gosh, could it be...

72
00:04:29,328 --> 00:04:33,078
What if the test shows
that he's Sang Gu's son?

73
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:38,818
It's better off not knowing,
so I shouldn't test his DNA at all.

74
00:04:40,968 --> 00:04:44,159
Wait. I should know
he isn't Sang Gu's son for sure.

75
00:04:44,309 --> 00:04:45,989
I can't have the doubt
looming over my head.

76
00:04:55,888 --> 00:04:57,268
Sang Gu, it's me.

77
00:04:57,518 --> 00:04:59,539
Can we get together today?

78
00:04:59,619 --> 00:05:01,039
Let's have brunch.

79
00:05:07,859 --> 00:05:08,905
Wait.

80
00:05:08,929 --> 00:05:10,279
Why are you all out here?

81
00:05:10,598 --> 00:05:13,098
Mr. Ko, it's your first day as CEO,

82
00:05:13,098 --> 00:05:15,388
so we should see you off.

83
00:05:15,968 --> 00:05:17,359
Don't be like that, Grandma.

84
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,439
CEO Ko, don't you forget
about writer Ko Myung Dong.

85
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:23,408
I'll write an amazing drama,
even if I break my wrist doing it,

86
00:05:23,408 --> 00:05:24,869
and bring it to you.

87
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:27,225
- Will you please sign me on?
- Goodness.

88
00:05:27,249 --> 00:05:29,198
Don't do that, Auntie.
It makes me cringe.

89
00:05:29,619 --> 00:05:32,008
CEO Ko, have a great day.

90
00:05:32,218 --> 00:05:34,958
- Good luck, Mr. CEO.
- Good luck.

91
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,328
I should leave. I can't stand this.
It's too embarrassing.

92
00:05:37,328 --> 00:05:38,409
See you.

93
00:05:38,528 --> 00:05:41,248
- Bye, Mr. Director.
- Bye, Mr. CEO.

94
00:05:42,098 --> 00:05:44,504
He's a CEO now, Mother.

95
00:05:44,528 --> 00:05:45,748
Get used to it.

96
00:05:52,078 --> 00:05:53,258
Good morning.

97
00:05:54,309 --> 00:05:55,659
Hello. Morning.

98
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:00,529
Goodness.

99
00:06:01,218 --> 00:06:03,268
He thinks he's all that
because he's the CEO now?

100
00:06:04,049 --> 00:06:05,669
I can't stand the sight.

101
00:06:06,619 --> 00:06:08,508
What should I do about him?

102
00:06:09,429 --> 00:06:11,909
I keep stomping on him,
but he keeps getting back up.

103
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:14,779
He's not a weed,
so why is he so tenacious?

104
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:18,419
Fine. Enjoy it all you want.

105
00:06:19,138 --> 00:06:20,549
It won't last.

106
00:06:21,468 --> 00:06:25,029
Once my brother adopts me
and I inherit APP Group,

107
00:06:25,609 --> 00:06:28,698
you'll be the first person
I get rid of.

108
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,299
Welcome, Mr. CEO.

109
00:06:34,148 --> 00:06:35,938
Do take good care of us, sir.

110
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,469
Mr. Ko.

111
00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:42,508
Stop it, everyone.
Treat me like you used to.

112
00:06:43,588 --> 00:06:44,739
I hope we do well together.

113
00:06:45,158 --> 00:06:47,049
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

114
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:50,748
Shall we get back to our jobs?

115
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:52,489
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

116
00:07:02,848 --> 00:07:05,128
(CEO Ko Pil Seung)

117
00:07:11,658 --> 00:07:13,609
Do Jun bought this.
Eat all you want.

118
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,909
- There's a lot left.
- Thank you.

119
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:17,629
- It's nice and sweet.
- Well done, Do Jun.

120
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:20,299
- Ji Young!
- Someone's at the door.

121
00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:21,748
- Who is it?
- Can you let me in?

122
00:07:22,429 --> 00:07:25,318
- Who's making the noise?
- Hi, Do Jun.

123
00:07:26,538 --> 00:07:28,985
- Right now...
- Why are you here, Jae Dong?

124
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:30,715
Ji Young made it big.

125
00:07:30,739 --> 00:07:32,179
- What do you mean?
- Big how?

126
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:34,208
Sit down
and take your time to explain.

127
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,799
Eat this first. You must be thirsty.

128
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,898
- Now talk.
- In the drama industry,

129
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:41,328
rather than Na Bi who was the lead,

130
00:07:42,018 --> 00:07:44,049
people are focusing on Ji Young.

131
00:07:44,049 --> 00:07:45,338
In other words,

132
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,809
Ji Young is a rising star.

133
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:52,578
Hey. Do you think
she can shoot some commercials?

134
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:55,045
I'm sure she will in the future.

135
00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:58,444
When in the future?
How long must we wait?

136
00:07:58,468 --> 00:08:00,919
But that's not the real issue.

137
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:02,258
There's bigger news.

138
00:08:03,369 --> 00:08:05,509
I'm sticking my head out so far
waiting for the news...

139
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:07,958
that my neck might snap.

140
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:10,398
We can't let your neck snap.

141
00:08:11,549 --> 00:08:13,029
Scriptwriter Kim Oh Kyeong...

142
00:08:13,648 --> 00:08:16,998
is planning a mystery melodrama
with a budget of tens of millions.

143
00:08:17,448 --> 00:08:19,969
She wants Ji Young to play the lead.

144
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:21,938
- My gosh.
- What?

145
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:25,905
No, that's crazy.

146
00:08:25,929 --> 00:08:29,229
I can't play the lead in a drama
with a budget of tens of millions.

147
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:31,169
It's the truth, Ji Young.

148
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:34,299
Hey. Are you sure about that?

149
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:36,069
Where did you hear that from?

150
00:08:36,069 --> 00:08:37,109
My source is accurate.

151
00:08:37,109 --> 00:08:39,958
I heard it from someone
who works at GOGO Entertainment.

152
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:44,259
I have a spy of sorts working there.

153
00:08:44,979 --> 00:08:47,598
- What?
- Who's that?

154
00:08:49,989 --> 00:08:51,708
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

155
00:08:54,688 --> 00:08:57,108
Silence. Please be quiet.

156
00:08:58,798 --> 00:09:01,078
Hello, Mr. Yoon.

157
00:09:02,568 --> 00:09:03,618
Right now?

158
00:09:03,729 --> 00:09:06,848
I'll come right in with Ji Young.
Okay. Thank you. Bye.

159
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:13,638
Ji Young. We must go
to GOGO Entertainment right now.

160
00:09:13,638 --> 00:09:15,209
- Why?
- The writer and director...

161
00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:16,648
want to see you.

162
00:09:16,648 --> 00:09:18,418
- What?
- My gosh.

163
00:09:18,418 --> 00:09:19,728
I don't believe it.

164
00:09:20,449 --> 00:09:23,749
Hey. Your clothes.
Change into something pretty.

165
00:09:23,749 --> 00:09:26,269
- And do your makeup. Get ready.
- What do we do?

166
00:09:26,489 --> 00:09:28,888
We don't have time to waste.
Where are her clothes?

167
00:09:28,888 --> 00:09:30,539
- Get changed.
- Not this outfit.

168
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:34,409
Am I really the lead?

169
00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:38,348
Ever since I got the idea
for this drama,

170
00:09:38,538 --> 00:09:41,318
I'd decided to cast you as the lead.

171
00:09:41,438 --> 00:09:44,419
So I really need you to say yes.

172
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:45,988
Will you?

173
00:09:46,278 --> 00:09:50,048
I'd appear in any of your works
a million times...

174
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,669
even as a passerby.

175
00:09:54,048 --> 00:09:55,139
But...

176
00:09:55,388 --> 00:09:58,269
But the lead
of such a huge project...

177
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:01,238
I don't have much experience,

178
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:06,208
and I'm afraid I might ruin
your work and reputation.

179
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:09,679
You'll do just fine, Ji Young.

180
00:10:09,928 --> 00:10:12,549
I want you in it
because I know you can manage.

181
00:10:13,398 --> 00:10:17,958
I see a sophisticated lady
from the city in you.

182
00:10:18,908 --> 00:10:21,559
You have a modern look
and class that words can't describe.

183
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:23,949
I think you lived in a city...

184
00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:26,029
and had a flashy career
in your past life.

185
00:10:26,178 --> 00:10:27,929
See if you can bring that out.

186
00:10:29,849 --> 00:10:31,539
Who? Me?

187
00:10:33,318 --> 00:10:34,708
Yes.

188
00:10:34,818 --> 00:10:38,779
Don't worry about anything
and focus on preparing for the role.

189
00:10:39,499 --> 00:10:43,078
Both Director Ko and I
believe in you.

190
00:10:45,028 --> 00:10:46,519
Thank you.

191
00:10:46,869 --> 00:10:49,759
I promise to prepare as best I can.

192
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:50,958
Thank you.

193
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:55,499
From now on,
you can't speak in a dialect.

194
00:10:55,849 --> 00:10:58,568
The drama title is "Seoul Lady."

195
00:10:58,849 --> 00:11:00,299
Do you get what I mean?

196
00:11:00,749 --> 00:11:02,438
Yes, of course I do.

197
00:11:02,619 --> 00:11:03,698
Oh, dear.

198
00:11:05,558 --> 00:11:06,669
I'll fix it.

199
00:11:07,518 --> 00:11:11,279
From... From now on,
I'll speak like a Seoulite.

200
00:11:12,058 --> 00:11:14,608
And I'll do what I can do...

201
00:11:14,829 --> 00:11:17,218
to become a Seoul lady somehow.

202
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:20,588
After we sign the contract today,

203
00:11:20,798 --> 00:11:23,318
will you give Ji Young a makeover?

204
00:11:23,408 --> 00:11:24,858
Get her some contacts.

205
00:11:24,938 --> 00:11:28,698
Sure. I'll turn her into
a sophisticated lady from Seoul.

206
00:11:30,509 --> 00:11:32,698
- Shall we sign the papers?
- Yes.

207
00:11:35,418 --> 00:11:36,468
Here.

208
00:11:37,418 --> 00:11:39,309
Sign on the line here.

209
00:11:39,359 --> 00:11:40,438
That's it.

210
00:12:04,648 --> 00:12:05,968
What's this?

211
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,219
How could this be?

212
00:12:08,219 --> 00:12:09,838
(A and B are
biological father and son.)

213
00:12:11,288 --> 00:12:14,208
Jin Dan is really Sang Gu's son?

214
00:12:17,388 --> 00:12:18,539
What do I do now?

215
00:12:19,158 --> 00:12:20,478
What should I do about this?

216
00:12:28,739 --> 00:12:31,588
I don't have to do anything.
No one knows.

217
00:12:32,938 --> 00:12:34,529
I just have to keep quiet.

218
00:12:35,349 --> 00:12:37,529
And why is Jin Dan Sang Gu's son?

219
00:12:37,648 --> 00:12:40,799
Jin Dan's father
is the late Chairman Gong Dae Gil.

220
00:12:56,898 --> 00:12:57,948
Come in.

221
00:13:06,178 --> 00:13:08,799
Ji Young. You're still here?

222
00:13:10,349 --> 00:13:11,458
Well...

223
00:13:13,048 --> 00:13:16,338
I wanted to ask you something.

224
00:13:18,188 --> 00:13:19,238
Take a seat.

225
00:13:30,028 --> 00:13:31,318
You can talk freely.

226
00:13:36,168 --> 00:13:39,138
I'm so honored to be cast...

227
00:13:39,138 --> 00:13:42,129
as the lead of such a huge project,

228
00:13:43,178 --> 00:13:46,029
but I'm afraid
because I'm not sure I can manage.

229
00:13:47,518 --> 00:13:50,098
And to be honest,
I still can't believe it.

230
00:13:51,648 --> 00:13:52,838
You should now.

231
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:56,309
We signed the papers
cementing your part of the deal.

232
00:13:59,398 --> 00:14:00,578
Did you...

233
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:04,078
go out on a limb...

234
00:14:04,499 --> 00:14:08,188
and take a huge risk
to cast me as the lead?

235
00:14:09,469 --> 00:14:10,559
I didn't.

236
00:14:10,739 --> 00:14:12,559
Ms. Kim explained earlier...

237
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:16,529
that she had you in mind
from the early stages.

238
00:14:17,349 --> 00:14:19,598
I agreed with her
because I believed...

239
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:21,499
you'd do fine.

240
00:14:25,249 --> 00:14:26,309
I see.

241
00:14:28,658 --> 00:14:29,738
Ji Young.

242
00:14:31,129 --> 00:14:32,478
Don't worry too much.

243
00:14:34,099 --> 00:14:35,749
You don't remember,

244
00:14:36,428 --> 00:14:39,348
but when you were Do Ra,
you were a massive star.

245
00:14:40,538 --> 00:14:42,118
Your talent showed,

246
00:14:42,908 --> 00:14:44,519
and your acting instincts
were revived.

247
00:14:45,739 --> 00:14:47,188
So trust in yourself...

248
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:49,299
and do your best.

249
00:14:50,908 --> 00:14:53,368
I hope you'll grow into
a great actress,

250
00:14:54,979 --> 00:14:56,098
and I'm rooting for you.

251
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:03,809
Thank you.

252
00:15:06,229 --> 00:15:07,909
I'll give it my all.

253
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,249
Goodbye, then.

254
00:15:21,808 --> 00:15:23,059
And...

255
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:30,098
congratulations on becoming the CEO.

256
00:15:56,278 --> 00:15:59,129
Director Ko,
you're still holding on, right?

257
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:02,999
Are you not?

258
00:16:06,188 --> 00:16:07,568
Since you're doing this,

259
00:16:08,589 --> 00:16:09,708
I hope you get the role.

260
00:16:10,028 --> 00:16:11,179
Ji Young.

261
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,549
Break a leg.

262
00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:16,478
I hope you'll grow into
a great actress,

263
00:16:18,028 --> 00:16:19,088
and I'm rooting for you.

264
00:16:25,979 --> 00:16:27,728
Why did you do that...

265
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:33,868
when Director Ko is
such a nice person?

266
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:40,438
And I like him too.

267
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:50,919
What am I supposed to do now?

268
00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:56,858
What should I do?

269
00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:03,059
I shouldn't be like this.

270
00:17:06,749 --> 00:17:09,299
Seriously, this isn't just right.

271
00:17:16,358 --> 00:17:22,618
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

272
00:17:33,239 --> 00:17:35,559
The more I think about it,
the more ridiculous it seems.

273
00:17:37,009 --> 00:17:39,368
I've never been slapped
in the face...

274
00:17:40,778 --> 00:17:42,568
while trying to kiss a girl.

275
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,769
And she didn't even call me
after that.

276
00:17:49,128 --> 00:17:53,378
How on earth is Ms. Baek
managing her artist as a CEO?

277
00:17:54,328 --> 00:17:56,068
Isn't she supposed to do her job...

278
00:17:56,068 --> 00:17:58,019
after getting 500,000 dollars
from me?

279
00:18:10,108 --> 00:18:12,868
Ms. Baek, it's me. Yes.

280
00:18:13,449 --> 00:18:15,128
I have something to discuss
with you.

281
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:26,949
All right.

282
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:34,588
What are you doing here, Mr. Gong?

283
00:18:34,899 --> 00:18:37,368
You weren't returning my calls,
so I had no other choice...

284
00:18:37,368 --> 00:18:38,519
but to show up.

285
00:18:38,979 --> 00:18:40,338
I'm sorry.

286
00:18:40,338 --> 00:18:43,799
I had something important to do,
so I turned my phone off.

287
00:18:44,209 --> 00:18:46,199
It's all right. I understand.

288
00:18:47,818 --> 00:18:50,398
By the way, Ji Young, I think...

289
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:53,408
we need more chances
to get to know each other.

290
00:18:53,459 --> 00:18:55,469
I bet you agree with me.

291
00:18:56,259 --> 00:18:57,309
What?

292
00:18:57,358 --> 00:18:58,788
So I was thinking...

293
00:18:58,788 --> 00:19:01,159
maybe we should go to Jeju Island...

294
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:02,669
for about three days this weekend.

295
00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:05,128
We can eat delicious food,
go for a drive,

296
00:19:05,128 --> 00:19:06,489
and go surfing.

297
00:19:06,899 --> 00:19:08,014
Jeju Island?

298
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:09,038
Yes.

299
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:10,768
I asked Ms. Baek,

300
00:19:10,768 --> 00:19:12,939
and she said
you were free this week.

301
00:19:12,939 --> 00:19:14,989
So I told her about my plans.

302
00:19:16,078 --> 00:19:17,199
Well...

303
00:19:17,709 --> 00:19:19,969
But I need to take care
of my grandmother.

304
00:19:20,149 --> 00:19:22,588
Your grandmother? Ms. Baek said...

305
00:19:22,588 --> 00:19:25,348
she would take good care of her,
so don't worry.

306
00:19:25,348 --> 00:19:29,009
I knew you would be like this,
so I asked Ms. Baek a favor.

307
00:19:32,399 --> 00:19:34,549
I'll think about it.

308
00:19:34,598 --> 00:19:37,368
Come on.
What's there to think about?

309
00:19:37,368 --> 00:19:40,289
You can just think
that we're going there to relax.

310
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:42,469
I'll get everything ready,

311
00:19:42,469 --> 00:19:45,989
so all you need to do
is come with me. Okay?

312
00:20:08,358 --> 00:20:09,899
How dare you bring...

313
00:20:09,899 --> 00:20:12,104
someone else's child
into our family?

314
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:14,499
You have to be visited
with punishment.

315
00:20:14,499 --> 00:20:17,409
I have to torture you to death,
and it won't still be enough!

316
00:20:17,409 --> 00:20:20,189
You wicked wench. You scumbag!

317
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:28,668
What was that?

318
00:20:30,219 --> 00:20:31,338
Was I dreaming?

319
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:36,108
What do I do now?

320
00:20:37,229 --> 00:20:38,439
Once they find out...

321
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:41,848
Jin Dan isn't Chairman Gong's son,

322
00:20:42,999 --> 00:20:44,519
it will be all over for us.

323
00:20:46,838 --> 00:20:47,918
No.

324
00:20:48,598 --> 00:20:50,858
No one has to know.

325
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:03,671
Ms. Kim Ji Young.

326
00:21:03,671 --> 00:21:05,521
What did you urgently need
to tell me?

327
00:21:06,102 --> 00:21:08,622
Did you find any problems
in your contract?

328
00:21:08,941 --> 00:21:11,662
No, it's not like that.

329
00:21:13,142 --> 00:21:15,791
What is it then? Just tell me.

330
00:21:18,112 --> 00:21:20,031
I've got a big favor to ask.

331
00:21:20,681 --> 00:21:22,832
So I'm not sure
if it's okay to say this.

332
00:21:23,421 --> 00:21:24,991
You can tell me anything.

333
00:21:24,991 --> 00:21:27,322
You're the lead role in our drama.

334
00:21:27,322 --> 00:21:29,912
We should get you whatever you need.

335
00:21:33,401 --> 00:21:34,951
I was wondering...

336
00:21:37,201 --> 00:21:39,731
if it was possible for me to get...

337
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:42,592
some of the down payment in advance.

338
00:21:44,741 --> 00:21:46,092
The down payment?

339
00:21:46,941 --> 00:21:49,842
That's not really something
I can answer.

340
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:52,332
I'll talk to the CEO
and get back to you.

341
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:55,971
I'm so sorry that I'm asking this
right after signing the contract.

342
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:59,372
It's no problem.
I'll ask the CEO and get back to you.

343
00:22:00,491 --> 00:22:01,761
Thank you.

344
00:22:01,761 --> 00:22:03,792
- Thank you.
- No problem.

345
00:22:03,792 --> 00:22:05,442
- Please go home safely.
- Okay.

346
00:22:10,332 --> 00:22:12,051
What was
Ms. Kim Ji Young doing here?

347
00:22:12,701 --> 00:22:15,322
Actually, I was going to come
to your office.

348
00:22:16,171 --> 00:22:17,362
Ms. Kim asked...

349
00:22:18,042 --> 00:22:20,531
if she could get
some of her down payment in advance.

350
00:22:21,282 --> 00:22:22,481
The contract states...

351
00:22:22,481 --> 00:22:25,261
that she gets 50 percent of her pay
after the first shoot.

352
00:22:25,382 --> 00:22:26,602
What do you want me to do?

353
00:22:27,382 --> 00:22:29,282
It was hard for her to bring it up.

354
00:22:29,282 --> 00:22:31,072
I think
she probably has her reasons.

355
00:22:31,522 --> 00:22:32,741
Pay her right away.

356
00:22:33,292 --> 00:22:35,372
Yes, Mr. Ko. I will.

357
00:22:53,382 --> 00:22:54,692
Yes, Mr. Yoon.

358
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:56,461
Ms. Kim.

359
00:22:56,711 --> 00:22:59,511
I just wired 50 percent of your pay
to CEO Lee Jae Dong's account.

360
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:00,672
Really?

361
00:23:01,852 --> 00:23:04,872
Thank you so much.

362
00:23:11,661 --> 00:23:13,877
Yes, CEO Jae Dong.

363
00:23:13,901 --> 00:23:16,431
GOGO Entertainment just sent us
50 percent of your pay.

364
00:23:16,431 --> 00:23:18,652
They said you asked for it.
Is that true?

365
00:23:19,032 --> 00:23:20,551
Yes, that's true.

366
00:23:20,772 --> 00:23:22,701
Then I'll send the money
to Ms. Baek's account...

367
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,511
with the commission fee
for Popcorn Entertainment deducted.

368
00:23:24,511 --> 00:23:27,291
Okay. Thank you so much.

369
00:23:39,991 --> 00:23:41,142
What is...

370
00:23:43,761 --> 00:23:44,811
What?

371
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:47,811
Hey. Jae Dong.

372
00:23:48,401 --> 00:23:50,521
What is this money for?

373
00:23:51,532 --> 00:23:52,652
What?

374
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:55,721
They paid 50 percent
of her down payment already?

375
00:23:56,671 --> 00:23:57,721
Okay.

376
00:23:58,272 --> 00:23:59,862
What is going on?

377
00:23:59,941 --> 00:24:02,092
Okay. I get it. Bye.

378
00:24:02,481 --> 00:24:03,981
What is happening?

379
00:24:03,981 --> 00:24:06,662
Ms. Baek, I'm home.

380
00:24:06,951 --> 00:24:08,731
Hey, Ji Young. Come here.

381
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:12,292
Did Jae Dong tell you...

382
00:24:12,292 --> 00:24:14,912
that you got 50 percent of your pay?

383
00:24:15,022 --> 00:24:17,792
Since GOGO Entertainment is
a subsidiary of a big conglomerate,

384
00:24:17,792 --> 00:24:19,032
it has the financial resources
for its artists.

385
00:24:19,032 --> 00:24:20,632
They sent half the payment...

386
00:24:20,632 --> 00:24:22,362
even though
you haven't started filming.

387
00:24:22,362 --> 00:24:23,922
I can't believe it.

388
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:27,122
But I heard you requested this.

389
00:24:27,872 --> 00:24:28,951
That's right.

390
00:24:29,741 --> 00:24:33,422
Can you pay Mr. Gong back
200,000 dollars for now?

391
00:24:33,782 --> 00:24:36,692
While doing so,
tell him I'll pay him the rest soon.

392
00:24:37,911 --> 00:24:38,961
What?

393
00:24:39,082 --> 00:24:41,632
Why would you pay him back?

394
00:24:43,451 --> 00:24:44,602
Ms. Baek.

395
00:24:46,022 --> 00:24:48,442
To be honest, I feel suffocated.

396
00:24:49,691 --> 00:24:50,892
I was told...

397
00:24:50,892 --> 00:24:53,008
that Mr. Gong used to be
my fiancé...

398
00:24:53,032 --> 00:24:57,082
and that he was the man
who saved our family once.

399
00:24:58,132 --> 00:25:01,491
That's why I tried my best
to make it work with him.

400
00:25:02,441 --> 00:25:05,692
However, no matter how hard I try,
I can't get myself to like him,

401
00:25:06,312 --> 00:25:07,692
and I feel suffocated.

402
00:25:08,511 --> 00:25:10,261
Hold on a second.

403
00:25:10,911 --> 00:25:14,031
Are you saying you won't date him?

404
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:18,271
It's not that,
but I'd like to take things slow.

405
00:25:19,491 --> 00:25:21,362
Mr. Gong and I...

406
00:25:21,362 --> 00:25:23,942
might have gotten engaged
because we liked each other,

407
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:26,311
but I don't remember any of that.

408
00:25:26,761 --> 00:25:28,481
So I'll pay him back for now...

409
00:25:28,532 --> 00:25:30,632
and decide
whether or not to date him...

410
00:25:30,632 --> 00:25:32,348
when I regain my memories.

411
00:25:32,372 --> 00:25:35,692
Hey. What kind of nonsense is that?

412
00:25:36,372 --> 00:25:38,791
Mr. Gong doesn't know
that you're Do Ra.

413
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:41,711
He gave me that money
as an investment...

414
00:25:41,711 --> 00:25:43,362
out of the pure love he has for you.

415
00:25:43,812 --> 00:25:46,132
How could you reject him
after we received that money?

416
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:49,522
Unbelievable.
That is ungrateful and selfish.

417
00:25:49,522 --> 00:25:52,402
How could you do this to the man...

418
00:25:52,691 --> 00:25:54,541
who saved our entire family?

419
00:25:54,991 --> 00:25:58,311
You can tell how much
Mr. Gong cares for you...

420
00:25:58,362 --> 00:25:59,931
by the fact that he gave me
500,000 dollars...

421
00:25:59,931 --> 00:26:01,511
just so that we can provide you
with everything.

422
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,882
Not everyone is that generous.

423
00:26:03,931 --> 00:26:05,622
Is 500,000 dollars chump change?

424
00:26:05,701 --> 00:26:07,922
But still, he sent it my way
without asking any questions.

425
00:26:07,971 --> 00:26:11,261
I get that.
I know we should be grateful.

426
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:15,162
But no matter how much I try,
I can't bring myself to love him.

427
00:26:15,911 --> 00:26:18,961
Besides, we need
to pay him back the money someday.

428
00:26:19,082 --> 00:26:20,731
That's why I'm paying him back.

429
00:26:20,882 --> 00:26:22,471
Only then...

430
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:25,491
will I be able to be with him
without any strings attached.

431
00:26:25,491 --> 00:26:26,872
That's why.

432
00:26:26,921 --> 00:26:29,568
Fine! I get it.

433
00:26:29,592 --> 00:26:31,092
What is all this?

434
00:26:31,092 --> 00:26:34,231
- Why you... You witch!
- My gosh.

435
00:26:34,231 --> 00:26:35,701
You wicked witch.

436
00:26:35,701 --> 00:26:37,302
- Ms. Lee, what's wrong?
- How dare you?

437
00:26:37,302 --> 00:26:39,772
Ji Young isn't
a human bargaining chip.

438
00:26:39,772 --> 00:26:42,447
How dare you sell her out for money?

439
00:26:42,471 --> 00:26:44,711
- Why you...
- Grandma, no.

440
00:26:44,711 --> 00:26:46,612
- You're wrong.
- Are you kidding me?

441
00:26:46,612 --> 00:26:48,481
Let go of me!

442
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,332
- It's not like that.
- You!

443
00:26:54,721 --> 00:26:55,951
Is it a special occasion today?

444
00:26:55,951 --> 00:26:57,971
It's not like you to suggest
that we meet first.

445
00:27:02,862 --> 00:27:05,642
I'm grateful for all
that you have done for me,

446
00:27:06,132 --> 00:27:07,582
so I wanted to treat you
to a meal...

447
00:27:08,201 --> 00:27:10,281
and tell you something.

448
00:27:10,731 --> 00:27:11,951
As in what?

449
00:27:13,072 --> 00:27:16,521
And what do you mean
by showing your gratitude?

450
00:27:19,342 --> 00:27:21,592
I know that you invested money
with Ms. Baek...

451
00:27:22,112 --> 00:27:25,932
all because you have
the greatest faith in my career.

452
00:27:27,151 --> 00:27:29,432
Right. Oh, that.

453
00:27:30,792 --> 00:27:33,172
That's why I wanted to make it work
with you,

454
00:27:33,691 --> 00:27:36,271
but I'm afraid I'll need some time.

455
00:27:37,261 --> 00:27:40,652
I'm starring in a new project,
so I want to focus solely on work.

456
00:27:41,961 --> 00:27:43,931
That being said, I can't go...

457
00:27:43,931 --> 00:27:45,951
to Jeju Island with you
this time around.

458
00:27:52,911 --> 00:27:54,031
What was that?

459
00:27:57,011 --> 00:27:58,231
I'm sorry.

460
00:28:04,451 --> 00:28:05,541
Ms. Kim.

461
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:10,072
Why do you think I invested
that money with Ms. Baek?

462
00:28:11,562 --> 00:28:14,251
You have a promising future
as an actress,

463
00:28:14,832 --> 00:28:17,011
and Ms. Baek is an expert
in this field.

464
00:28:17,132 --> 00:28:19,521
I invested in you
because I like you.

465
00:28:20,001 --> 00:28:21,521
Because I wanted us to work.

466
00:28:23,042 --> 00:28:25,162
Money follows the heart.

467
00:28:25,842 --> 00:28:27,312
There are people
who speak of love...

468
00:28:27,312 --> 00:28:28,632
but don't do anything about it.

469
00:28:29,011 --> 00:28:31,301
That's not love, but a lie.

470
00:28:32,352 --> 00:28:34,181
However, because I love you,

471
00:28:34,181 --> 00:28:35,552
I invested 500,000 dollars
with Ms. Baek...

472
00:28:35,552 --> 00:28:36,971
so that she could support you.

473
00:28:37,552 --> 00:28:41,011
But look at you walking all over
my innocent love.

474
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:50,311
I mean...

475
00:28:52,471 --> 00:28:54,822
I didn't want to say this
at the risk of sounding cheap,

476
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:58,422
but 500,000 dollars isn't a joke.

477
00:28:59,511 --> 00:29:01,162
That's a huge amount of money.

478
00:29:01,842 --> 00:29:05,031
I contemplate for days and weeks
to make an investment of that size.

479
00:29:05,511 --> 00:29:09,072
I felt burdened by the large amount,

480
00:29:10,721 --> 00:29:12,592
which is why I told Ms. Baek...

481
00:29:12,592 --> 00:29:15,041
to give back
200,000 dollars for now.

482
00:29:18,461 --> 00:29:19,912
What are you talking about?

483
00:29:20,701 --> 00:29:21,912
What 200,000 dollars?

484
00:29:24,072 --> 00:29:27,991
Ms. Baek would've wired you
200,000 dollars.

485
00:29:28,741 --> 00:29:30,147
Didn't you receive the money?

486
00:29:30,171 --> 00:29:31,392
What money?

487
00:29:31,572 --> 00:29:33,932
I haven't gotten a penny from her.

488
00:29:34,612 --> 00:29:35,662
What?

489
00:29:40,552 --> 00:29:41,672
Ms. Baek!

490
00:29:42,382 --> 00:29:45,642
- Ms. Baek!
- Hey. What is it?

491
00:29:45,822 --> 00:29:49,211
Ms. Baek, why didn't you wire
200,000 dollars to Mr. Gong?

492
00:29:49,522 --> 00:29:52,382
I thought that you
had already sent him the money.

493
00:29:52,961 --> 00:29:56,511
Oh, that? Well, I've been busy.

494
00:29:57,401 --> 00:30:00,171
Still. Why would we pay him back...

495
00:30:00,171 --> 00:30:02,092
when he made an investment?

496
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:03,922
Ms. Baek,

497
00:30:04,842 --> 00:30:06,991
what on earth are you saying?

498
00:30:07,612 --> 00:30:09,282
Ji Young, please.

499
00:30:09,282 --> 00:30:11,561
Let's get a better place to live
with that money.

500
00:30:11,782 --> 00:30:13,782
I've been looking
for a new place for us.

501
00:30:13,782 --> 00:30:16,627
We can't keep on living like this.
Just look at our situation.

502
00:30:16,651 --> 00:30:17,852
We're cramped up
in this tiny unit...

503
00:30:17,852 --> 00:30:19,528
when we have a dementia patient
to care for.

504
00:30:19,552 --> 00:30:22,771
We can't live like this forever
cramped up in this space.

505
00:30:22,961 --> 00:30:25,981
No. Give me that money.

506
00:30:26,332 --> 00:30:29,082
I'll pay him back,
so give me the money.

507
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:32,372
I still don't get
why you want to pay him back...

508
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,451
when he's not asking you
for the money.

509
00:30:35,342 --> 00:30:36,477
Unbelievable.

510
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,961
Also, let me be honest.

511
00:30:39,241 --> 00:30:41,241
Why can't you date him
even though you don't like him?

512
00:30:41,241 --> 00:30:42,862
What's so suffocating about it?

513
00:30:42,911 --> 00:30:45,201
It's not like Mr. Gong
is harassing you.

514
00:30:45,782 --> 00:30:46,911
I can't give you the money.

515
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:48,801
I'm finding a new place
for us to live.

516
00:30:50,651 --> 00:30:51,771
Ms. Baek.

517
00:30:54,661 --> 00:30:57,882
Ms. Baek, are you really my mother?

518
00:31:01,431 --> 00:31:02,551
What?

519
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:06,082
You wouldn't say that
if you were my mom.

520
00:31:07,302 --> 00:31:09,201
I've been constantly telling you...

521
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,622
that being with Mr. Gong
is suffocating.

522
00:31:12,511 --> 00:31:15,932
It's not like I said
that I wouldn't date him.

523
00:31:16,011 --> 00:31:18,561
All I want is to take things slow.

524
00:31:20,082 --> 00:31:21,481
It's like
he bought this relationship,

525
00:31:21,481 --> 00:31:22,932
which makes me uncomfortable.

526
00:31:23,892 --> 00:31:25,201
That's why...

527
00:31:25,892 --> 00:31:29,342
I requested for an advance payment
even though it wasn't easy to ask.

528
00:31:30,122 --> 00:31:34,231
I wouldn't have made
such a request...

529
00:31:34,231 --> 00:31:36,481
if it hadn't been
eating me up inside.

530
00:31:37,632 --> 00:31:38,781
If...

531
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:42,352
If it weren't for that money,
I wouldn't be dating him.

532
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,561
I...

533
00:31:45,272 --> 00:31:48,531
I was told that you were my mom,

534
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:52,832
and I didn't want you to die
to loan sharks.

535
00:31:53,552 --> 00:31:57,892
They were going to hurt
Do Sik and Do Jun,

536
00:31:57,892 --> 00:32:01,711
so I did as you said
and dated Mr. Gong.

537
00:32:02,991 --> 00:32:05,637
But it has been suffocating,

538
00:32:05,661 --> 00:32:07,477
which is why
I wanted to pay him back,

539
00:32:07,501 --> 00:32:10,682
but why aren't you letting me?

540
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:14,922
Give me the money.

541
00:32:15,042 --> 00:32:18,221
- I mean...
- Give me the money.

542
00:32:18,342 --> 00:32:19,422
What was that?

543
00:32:20,441 --> 00:32:22,031
Did this witch...

544
00:32:22,282 --> 00:32:26,132
really sell you out
in exchange for money?

545
00:32:26,552 --> 00:32:27,731
My gosh!

546
00:32:27,852 --> 00:32:32,491
- You evil witch!
- My gosh.

547
00:32:32,491 --> 00:32:34,041
- Mom, please.
- You!

548
00:32:34,362 --> 00:32:36,491
- How dare you?
- Grandma, please!

549
00:32:36,491 --> 00:32:39,092
How could you?

550
00:32:39,092 --> 00:32:40,642
- Let go!
- Are you kidding me?

551
00:32:40,701 --> 00:32:42,682
- You!
- Stop that.

552
00:32:43,332 --> 00:32:45,481
Goodness me.

553
00:32:46,072 --> 00:32:47,251
My gosh.

554
00:32:47,901 --> 00:32:49,122
Gosh.

555
00:32:49,642 --> 00:32:50,721
Ji Young.

556
00:32:51,671 --> 00:32:55,031
Are you being forced to date him
because he gave us money?

557
00:33:01,681 --> 00:33:04,322
Mom, I don't care
how desperate we are.

558
00:33:04,322 --> 00:33:06,902
How could you force her
to date a man in exchange for money?

559
00:33:07,761 --> 00:33:09,172
And why won't you pay him back?

560
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:12,082
You had her dance at a nightclub
to bail me out once.

561
00:33:13,431 --> 00:33:15,311
Mom, you promised
not to do this again.

562
00:33:15,802 --> 00:33:20,551
Mom, why are you
treating her this way?

563
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:26,362
- My gosh!
- Do Jun!

564
00:33:28,142 --> 00:33:31,461
How could you do this
to Ji Young again?

565
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:35,332
Do Jun...

566
00:33:37,421 --> 00:33:40,651
How could a mother do this
to her own daughter?

567
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:43,397
- Do Jun, calm down!
- Do Jun...

568
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:44,931
- Do Jun, please.
- Do Jun, don't.

569
00:33:44,931 --> 00:33:46,637
Have you forgotten
why she died in the first place?

570
00:33:46,661 --> 00:33:49,451
How could you do this to her
knowing that?

571
00:33:50,032 --> 00:33:52,422
Don't you feel bad for her?

572
00:33:53,302 --> 00:33:55,751
How could you do this
when you're her mother?

573
00:33:55,802 --> 00:33:59,322
Do Jun, you have it all wrong!

574
00:33:59,741 --> 00:34:01,932
The loan sharks threatened
to kill you...

575
00:34:02,681 --> 00:34:06,561
if I didn't pay back my debt.
Do Jun, please.

576
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:11,001
Do Jun, no!

577
00:34:12,751 --> 00:34:16,541
Do Jun, no...

578
00:34:17,392 --> 00:34:18,541
My gosh.

579
00:34:20,631 --> 00:34:23,512
Do Jun, please.

580
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:28,391
Do Jun...

581
00:34:30,672 --> 00:34:33,291
(Pharmacy)

582
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:44,601
Ji Young, why didn't you tell us?

583
00:34:45,451 --> 00:34:47,972
You made us feel guilty
by keeping us in the dark.

584
00:34:48,761 --> 00:34:50,981
You might not remember it,
but we're still a family.

585
00:34:51,062 --> 00:34:53,261
We would've been able
to come up with a solution,

586
00:34:53,261 --> 00:34:54,981
so why did you handle it
all by yourself?

587
00:34:57,301 --> 00:34:59,052
When you weren't around,

588
00:34:59,872 --> 00:35:02,351
loan sharks barged into our unit...

589
00:35:02,502 --> 00:35:04,922
and told Ms. Baek
to pay back her debt.

590
00:35:05,511 --> 00:35:07,931
They made her sign over the rights
to her body.

591
00:35:10,212 --> 00:35:12,501
It's the money she owed...

592
00:35:12,982 --> 00:35:14,501
from back in the day.

593
00:35:16,122 --> 00:35:18,051
If we didn't pay them back,

594
00:35:18,051 --> 00:35:21,211
they were going to hunt you two down
and hurt you.

595
00:35:21,991 --> 00:35:25,541
Ms. Baek went to Mr. Gong
and begged him for the money.

596
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:30,512
He gave her 500,000 dollars
but requested...

597
00:35:31,031 --> 00:35:32,952
that I date him in return.

598
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:36,351
I said...

599
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:38,592
I'd go along with it.

600
00:35:39,411 --> 00:35:42,262
You still should've told us.

601
00:35:42,911 --> 00:35:45,561
The money was too much
for us to come up with.

602
00:35:46,281 --> 00:35:48,221
Knowing about it...

603
00:35:48,221 --> 00:35:50,672
would only upset and worry you.

604
00:35:53,221 --> 00:35:55,041
Besides, I was told...

605
00:35:55,892 --> 00:35:58,131
that I got engaged
to Mr. Gong out of love...

606
00:35:58,131 --> 00:35:59,481
when I was Do Ra.

607
00:35:59,792 --> 00:36:01,751
That's why I decided to try
and date him.

608
00:36:04,031 --> 00:36:06,981
However, I couldn't
bring myself to like him,

609
00:36:07,701 --> 00:36:09,552
and it has been a nightmare.

610
00:36:11,142 --> 00:36:13,841
So I asked the production house
for an advance...

611
00:36:13,841 --> 00:36:15,642
on the payment
from the new project...

612
00:36:15,642 --> 00:36:17,862
and tried to give at least
200,000 dollars back.

613
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:20,202
I was going to try
and date him again...

614
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:23,601
once I regained my memories.

615
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,572
But Ms. Baek never paid him back.

616
00:36:29,692 --> 00:36:31,641
Unbelievable!

617
00:36:32,161 --> 00:36:33,481
Don't.

618
00:36:34,031 --> 00:36:36,981
I don't get her at all.

619
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:41,052
There's a reason
you once took your own life.

620
00:36:42,142 --> 00:36:44,121
We were lucky enough
to get you back, but...

621
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:49,492
Ji Young, there's
not much more to say.

622
00:36:50,142 --> 00:36:51,731
Move out of that house.

623
00:36:52,051 --> 00:36:53,362
Live with me instead.

624
00:36:54,622 --> 00:36:56,871
Do Jun, I'm just as furious.

625
00:36:57,652 --> 00:36:59,771
But we're also to blame
for being in the dark.

626
00:37:00,321 --> 00:37:02,491
Mom had to give up her rights
to her body.

627
00:37:02,491 --> 00:37:04,392
I would've done the same
if I had been in Ji Young's shoes.

628
00:37:04,392 --> 00:37:06,882
I would've forced myself
to date that person too.

629
00:37:08,732 --> 00:37:10,581
I'll earn the money
and pay him back somehow.

630
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:14,592
But Do Jun,

631
00:37:15,372 --> 00:37:17,052
she's still our mother.

632
00:37:17,942 --> 00:37:19,422
Don't be too harsh on her.

633
00:37:19,911 --> 00:37:22,061
This must be
eating her up inside as well.

634
00:37:26,051 --> 00:37:27,262
Do Jun.

635
00:37:28,122 --> 00:37:29,271
Do Jun!

636
00:37:34,152 --> 00:37:36,672
Do Jun, wait.

637
00:37:37,392 --> 00:37:38,911
Do Jun, don't do this.

638
00:37:39,631 --> 00:37:40,631
Do Jun.

639
00:37:40,631 --> 00:37:43,112
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

640
00:37:43,201 --> 00:37:46,581
What are you apologizing for?
I'm the one who should apologize.

641
00:37:50,341 --> 00:37:51,391
Do Jun...

642
00:37:55,542 --> 00:37:58,302
Ji Young, I'm sorry.

643
00:37:58,911 --> 00:38:00,461
I'm so sorry.

644
00:38:02,821 --> 00:38:04,572
Don't say that.

645
00:38:05,821 --> 00:38:07,811
I'm the one who's sorry.

646
00:38:08,991 --> 00:38:11,581
So don't you apologize for anything.

647
00:38:22,741 --> 00:38:23,822
Ji Young.

648
00:38:24,571 --> 00:38:26,322
Before you died,

649
00:38:27,212 --> 00:38:30,561
I didn't know about your situation
because I had been studying abroad.

650
00:38:31,611 --> 00:38:34,771
And I feel guilty
for not being able to help you.

651
00:38:35,451 --> 00:38:37,601
I hate myself for not being able...

652
00:38:38,721 --> 00:38:40,672
to protect you.

653
00:38:41,721 --> 00:38:44,242
But you came back to us alive.

654
00:38:45,431 --> 00:38:48,012
And I apologize
for not protecting you again.

655
00:38:52,071 --> 00:38:53,282
Gosh, no.

656
00:38:54,301 --> 00:38:57,121
Why would you protect me
when I'm the big sister?

657
00:38:58,312 --> 00:38:59,461
Do Jun.

658
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:02,192
Think only about yourself.

659
00:39:04,451 --> 00:39:06,752
I may not remember anything,

660
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,802
but we were able to meet again.

661
00:39:09,982 --> 00:39:12,871
So don't worry about me anymore.

662
00:39:13,522 --> 00:39:14,612
Okay?

663
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:21,782
Do Jun.

664
00:39:24,102 --> 00:39:25,652
You won't have to wait long.

665
00:39:26,801 --> 00:39:29,542
I'll earn tons of money...

666
00:39:29,542 --> 00:39:32,391
and help you study abroad again.

667
00:39:33,411 --> 00:39:34,461
Ji Young,

668
00:39:34,911 --> 00:39:37,092
stop saying things like that.

669
00:39:40,781 --> 00:39:42,032
Do Jun.

670
00:39:43,082 --> 00:39:45,001
Do Jun, thanks!

671
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,612
Do Jun!

672
00:39:50,491 --> 00:39:53,942
I'm happy to have you in my life!

673
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:06,404
What now?

674
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,523
Do Jun and Do Sik
are aware of everything now.

675
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:11,693
Never have I...

676
00:40:11,844 --> 00:40:15,434
Never have I seen
such an evil being before.

677
00:40:15,743 --> 00:40:18,804
You evil stepmom!

678
00:40:19,614 --> 00:40:21,903
You can't treat her this way
because she isn't your daughter.

679
00:40:21,984 --> 00:40:23,723
Give me the money.

680
00:40:23,723 --> 00:40:27,003
Give me Ji Young's money!

681
00:40:27,154 --> 00:40:29,993
Give me the money.

682
00:40:29,993 --> 00:40:31,563
Stop that.

683
00:40:31,563 --> 00:40:32,964
Geum Dong, my gosh.

684
00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:36,034
Geum Dong,
how could you have married...

685
00:40:36,034 --> 00:40:38,734
a witch this evil?

686
00:40:38,734 --> 00:40:41,074
It's not like you are blind.

687
00:40:41,074 --> 00:40:43,304
How could you have married
this witch...

688
00:40:43,304 --> 00:40:45,473
when you have functioning eyes?

689
00:40:45,473 --> 00:40:49,543
This witch won't give up the money
she took from Ji Young.

690
00:40:49,543 --> 00:40:51,514
Pulling out her hair
won't even do the trick.

691
00:40:51,514 --> 00:40:54,304
What are we going to do about her?

692
00:41:01,094 --> 00:41:02,914
Mom, give me Ji Young's money.

693
00:41:07,563 --> 00:41:09,213
Who are you to ask for that?

694
00:41:09,764 --> 00:41:11,414
I don't have it.

695
00:41:11,764 --> 00:41:13,054
Where is it, then?

696
00:41:13,873 --> 00:41:16,054
Don't lie to me and give it up.

697
00:41:16,904 --> 00:41:19,023
I said I didn't have it!

698
00:41:22,643 --> 00:41:23,894
Give me your passcode.

699
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:25,614
Give me my phone!

700
00:41:25,614 --> 00:41:26,913
- Tell him.
- Give it here.

701
00:41:26,913 --> 00:41:29,934
- Tell him. If you don't...
- Tell me your passcode!

702
00:41:29,984 --> 00:41:32,824
Tell him or I'll crack your skull.

703
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:36,764
Are you kidding me?

704
00:41:36,764 --> 00:41:40,684
Why are you all
treating me this way?

705
00:41:42,364 --> 00:41:44,784
My gosh.

706
00:41:46,703 --> 00:41:49,103
Unbelievable...

707
00:41:49,103 --> 00:41:51,023
(Deposit: 200,000 dollars sent
from Baek Mi Ja)

708
00:41:54,214 --> 00:41:58,164
Ms. Baek would've wired you
200,000 dollars.

709
00:41:58,884 --> 00:42:00,264
Didn't you receive the money?

710
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,403
What are you playing at?

711
00:42:11,723 --> 00:42:14,713
Ms. Baek, why did you
wire me this money?

712
00:42:15,293 --> 00:42:17,113
You used me when you needed money.

713
00:42:17,203 --> 00:42:19,684
Are you kicking me to the curb
now that you don't need me?

714
00:42:19,873 --> 00:42:23,523
Gosh, of course not. That's not it.

715
00:42:24,243 --> 00:42:26,693
Ji Young found out
that I received...

716
00:42:26,743 --> 00:42:29,413
investment money from you.

717
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:31,543
Because of that,
she felt burdened...

718
00:42:31,543 --> 00:42:34,463
every time you two went on dates.

719
00:42:34,654 --> 00:42:38,623
You know how pure
and innocent she is.

720
00:42:38,623 --> 00:42:41,403
So knowing that the relationship
was based on money...

721
00:42:41,754 --> 00:42:44,493
made her incredibly uncomfortable.

722
00:42:44,493 --> 00:42:46,893
It was as if the relationship
was bought,

723
00:42:46,893 --> 00:42:49,414
and she felt like
she had an obligation.

724
00:42:50,103 --> 00:42:52,454
That's why I paid some of it back.

725
00:42:53,634 --> 00:42:55,373
She had to pay some of it back...

726
00:42:55,373 --> 00:42:58,593
in order to date you
with no strings attached.

727
00:42:59,344 --> 00:43:00,373
Is that so?

728
00:43:00,373 --> 00:43:02,394
Yes, of course!

729
00:43:03,114 --> 00:43:04,714
Anyway, that happened.

730
00:43:04,714 --> 00:43:06,304
By the way, Mr. Gong,

731
00:43:06,453 --> 00:43:08,534
please take it slow.

732
00:43:08,784 --> 00:43:11,534
I'm sure you get what I mean.

733
00:43:11,683 --> 00:43:14,704
Absolutely. I hear you.

734
00:43:15,594 --> 00:43:19,043
Sure thing. Got it.

735
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,554
Was that why she acted like that?

736
00:43:29,004 --> 00:43:30,954
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

737
00:43:31,074 --> 00:43:32,293
Yes.

738
00:43:33,473 --> 00:43:35,664
She would be reluctant if she knew...

739
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:38,064
money was involved.

740
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:41,334
Gosh. Ji Young...

741
00:43:42,154 --> 00:43:44,304
really is different from other women.

742
00:43:47,523 --> 00:43:49,043
Is that why I fell for her?

743
00:44:03,804 --> 00:44:06,463
Hey. Are you okay?

744
00:44:17,723 --> 00:44:18,874
- Gosh.
- Hello.

745
00:44:19,254 --> 00:44:21,974
Chairman Gong. What happened?

746
00:44:22,523 --> 00:44:25,073
What did you do to your arm?

747
00:44:25,123 --> 00:44:26,244
It's no big deal.

748
00:44:26,634 --> 00:44:28,684
I played tennis with Chairman Kim.

749
00:44:29,663 --> 00:44:32,184
I hadn't played in a while,
and I fell.

750
00:44:32,634 --> 00:44:36,253
You're too old to play tennis.
You should be more careful.

751
00:44:36,603 --> 00:44:37,954
How bad is it?

752
00:44:38,174 --> 00:44:41,023
I landed on my arm
and got a hairline fracture.

753
00:44:41,773 --> 00:44:43,994
I need to keep the cast on
just for a few days.

754
00:44:44,444 --> 00:44:47,034
You shouldn't play
such a rough sport at your age.

755
00:44:48,313 --> 00:44:50,133
Play some light golf.

756
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:53,173
Don't act like you're in your teens.

757
00:44:56,063 --> 00:44:58,343
Did you have to go and hurt
your right arm?

758
00:45:02,094 --> 00:45:03,253
- Sir.
- Thanks.

759
00:45:12,614 --> 00:45:13,849
- Ms. Yeoju.
- Yes.

760
00:45:13,873 --> 00:45:15,693
Do we still have
some strawberry oat cake?

761
00:45:16,014 --> 00:45:18,313
Yes, in the fridge.
I'll get it for you.

762
00:45:18,313 --> 00:45:20,104
No, I'll get it. You can go.

763
00:45:20,514 --> 00:45:21,564
Okay.

764
00:45:39,734 --> 00:45:40,784
Ms. Yeoju.

765
00:45:41,304 --> 00:45:42,394
Yes?

766
00:45:42,904 --> 00:45:44,304
Can you take this to Ma Ri?

767
00:45:44,304 --> 00:45:45,894
Yes, of course.

768
00:46:04,464 --> 00:46:05,514
Leave it.

769
00:46:06,893 --> 00:46:08,383
Don't mind me. Go to Ma Ri.

770
00:46:11,103 --> 00:46:13,523
Eat. You like dried croaker
aged in barley.

771
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:15,414
Let me.

772
00:47:27,074 --> 00:47:28,394
Why did you do it?

773
00:47:33,614 --> 00:47:36,534
If you'd told me the truth
from the start,

774
00:47:37,424 --> 00:47:39,173
I'd have forgiven you.

775
00:47:41,353 --> 00:47:42,914
Pil Seung, your son.

776
00:47:45,364 --> 00:47:47,483
I could've accepted him as mine.

777
00:47:49,764 --> 00:47:51,414
Out of love for you.

778
00:47:53,603 --> 00:47:56,054
I could accept anything about you.

779
00:48:00,973 --> 00:48:02,534
Why did you lie to me?

780
00:48:05,614 --> 00:48:07,304
Why did you deceive me?

781
00:48:10,023 --> 00:48:11,104
Leave.

782
00:48:13,054 --> 00:48:14,704
I don't want to see you anymore.

783
00:48:45,353 --> 00:48:47,924
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

784
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:49,163
Hello. Did you call for a driver?

785
00:48:49,163 --> 00:48:50,474
- Yes.
- We did.

786
00:48:52,194 --> 00:48:54,284
- Watch out.
- Watch your head.

787
00:48:54,993 --> 00:48:56,134
- See you.
- Bye.

788
00:48:56,134 --> 00:48:58,284
- Take care.
- Bye. Drive safely, please.

789
00:49:00,174 --> 00:49:02,023
- I'll set off, then.
- Okay.

790
00:50:03,563 --> 00:50:04,663
Sang Gu.

791
00:50:04,663 --> 00:50:06,224
What's up, Ae Kyo?

792
00:50:06,373 --> 00:50:08,023
Why did you want to see me
this early?

793
00:50:08,873 --> 00:50:12,193
I want to ask a favor of you.

794
00:50:12,714 --> 00:50:14,323
Ask a favor of me? What is it?

795
00:50:15,273 --> 00:50:18,313
Sang Gu. Can you go
to the Philippines for a while?

796
00:50:18,313 --> 00:50:19,363
For 3 or 4 months.

797
00:50:19,953 --> 00:50:21,403
Why would you say that?

798
00:50:21,813 --> 00:50:23,633
I got back less than a month ago.

799
00:50:23,824 --> 00:50:25,974
We just reunited,
and you want us to part again?

800
00:50:26,194 --> 00:50:28,543
I know we just met again,

801
00:50:28,953 --> 00:50:30,543
but I have my reasons.

802
00:50:30,964 --> 00:50:32,514
What are they?

803
00:50:34,094 --> 00:50:36,753
You know Jin Dan's older brother,
don't you?

804
00:50:37,004 --> 00:50:39,383
APP Group's Chairman Gong.

805
00:50:39,904 --> 00:50:41,304
He only has a daughter,

806
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:43,994
and she was hurt in an accident.

807
00:50:44,603 --> 00:50:46,593
In other words,

808
00:50:46,714 --> 00:50:48,724
Jin Dan is the only rightful heir
to the company.

809
00:50:50,243 --> 00:50:52,494
But because I was
the late chairman's mistress,

810
00:50:52,583 --> 00:50:55,834
even when Jin Dan did well,
he was looked down upon,

811
00:50:55,884 --> 00:50:57,534
and no one acknowledged him.

812
00:50:57,884 --> 00:50:59,874
Is he really looked down on?

813
00:50:59,924 --> 00:51:01,003
Yes.

814
00:51:01,254 --> 00:51:03,573
The family decided that Jin Dan...

815
00:51:04,393 --> 00:51:06,414
should be adopted by his brother.

816
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:09,043
I want to give him a stronger claim
as a successor.

817
00:51:10,264 --> 00:51:13,724
So can you stay
in the Philippines for a while?

818
00:51:14,534 --> 00:51:16,019
It's an important time...

819
00:51:16,043 --> 00:51:19,023
for Jin Dan regarding the adoption.

820
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:21,749
I'm afraid someone might see us...

821
00:51:21,773 --> 00:51:24,233
and cause a fuss
that becomes a problem.

822
00:51:24,683 --> 00:51:25,784
I'm not saying...

823
00:51:25,784 --> 00:51:27,564
we should get back together
right away.

824
00:51:27,683 --> 00:51:29,623
Can't we meet briefly for tea
every now and then?

825
00:51:29,623 --> 00:51:30,974
Of course we can't.

826
00:51:31,853 --> 00:51:34,744
What if I'm caught
seeing my old flame?

827
00:51:35,023 --> 00:51:38,414
People will talk, it will spread,
and it will become an obstacle.

828
00:51:40,134 --> 00:51:42,784
I'll call you
when everything's taken care of.

829
00:51:43,163 --> 00:51:46,054
Let's start over then.
Please, Sang Gu?

830
00:51:47,833 --> 00:51:48,883
Do you mean that?

831
00:51:49,344 --> 00:51:50,823
Yes, I do.

832
00:51:51,273 --> 00:51:53,193
Once Jin Dan secures his place,

833
00:51:53,743 --> 00:51:55,894
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

834
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:59,190
I'm sure Jin Dan
will accept that then.

835
00:51:59,214 --> 00:52:00,863
What would I have to fear?

836
00:52:02,413 --> 00:52:03,503
Okay.

837
00:52:04,523 --> 00:52:07,393
I don't want to be an obstacle
to something so important.

838
00:52:07,393 --> 00:52:08,443
I got it.

839
00:52:08,924 --> 00:52:10,244
Thank you, Sang Gu.

840
00:52:11,264 --> 00:52:12,343
Oh, right.

841
00:52:15,734 --> 00:52:17,684
Spend this while you're abroad.

842
00:52:18,333 --> 00:52:21,873
I also bought you
some clothes and shoes.

843
00:52:21,873 --> 00:52:22,923
Take them with you.

844
00:52:25,973 --> 00:52:27,093
Okay.

845
00:52:27,743 --> 00:52:30,064
I'll take it since you want me to.

846
00:52:30,913 --> 00:52:32,593
Oh, and Sang Gu.

847
00:52:33,384 --> 00:52:35,133
Don't go around...

848
00:52:35,254 --> 00:52:38,503
telling anyone
that Jin Dan looks like your father.

849
00:52:38,953 --> 00:52:40,503
It's weird.

850
00:52:40,623 --> 00:52:42,573
What if someone were to get ideas?

851
00:52:43,094 --> 00:52:45,374
Is it weird? I guess it could be.

852
00:52:46,194 --> 00:52:47,914
I got it. I won't say that.

853
00:52:49,163 --> 00:52:50,514
Yes, Sang Gu.

854
00:52:51,264 --> 00:52:54,383
You can't stay here. You must leave.

855
00:52:55,473 --> 00:52:58,593
(Chairman Gong Jin Taek)

856
00:53:00,114 --> 00:53:01,593
Yes, come in.

857
00:53:10,884 --> 00:53:12,503
What are you doing here?

858
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:19,713
You're not able to eat out.

859
00:53:20,433 --> 00:53:23,764
I brought some finger food,
so your stomach won't feel funny.

860
00:53:23,764 --> 00:53:25,014
Try some later.

861
00:53:26,433 --> 00:53:28,724
Wait. Stop right there.

862
00:53:34,674 --> 00:53:36,963
When I think
about what you did to me,

863
00:53:37,913 --> 00:53:39,903
I'm supposed to hate and loathe you.

864
00:53:41,353 --> 00:53:43,133
And I should never...

865
00:53:44,023 --> 00:53:45,773
want to see you again.

866
00:53:48,853 --> 00:53:50,613
But I took you in again...

867
00:53:51,623 --> 00:53:53,314
and let you take care of Ma Ri.

868
00:53:54,163 --> 00:53:56,314
Now that I'm receiving your help,

869
00:53:57,534 --> 00:54:00,724
you think I'm like a fool, right?

870
00:54:01,603 --> 00:54:03,854
No, that's not true.

871
00:54:05,944 --> 00:54:09,793
I'm just thankful
that you let me stay with Ma Ri.

872
00:54:10,743 --> 00:54:14,490
And I can't thank you enough
for letting me...

873
00:54:14,514 --> 00:54:17,133
do something for you...

874
00:54:18,223 --> 00:54:19,744
as a gesture of apology.

875
00:54:21,123 --> 00:54:23,073
So you can always tell me...

876
00:54:23,964 --> 00:54:27,613
if I make you uncomfortable
or give you a hard time.

877
00:54:28,893 --> 00:54:32,584
Ma Ri is good enough
to go for a walk with Mr. Park now.

878
00:54:34,674 --> 00:54:36,023
So I can move out.

879
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:39,724
No, just stay.

880
00:54:45,844 --> 00:54:47,604
You can't just move out like this.

881
00:54:51,924 --> 00:54:53,003
I...

882
00:54:54,123 --> 00:54:55,874
told Lawyer Kang...

883
00:54:57,464 --> 00:54:59,014
to cancel the divorce suit.

884
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:06,184
Part of me still hates you...

885
00:55:06,603 --> 00:55:08,224
and can't stand the sight of you.

886
00:55:10,243 --> 00:55:11,394
But...

887
00:55:12,844 --> 00:55:13,894
I don't think...

888
00:55:15,243 --> 00:55:17,164
I can live without you.

889
00:55:19,313 --> 00:55:21,604
I hate that I'm being like this,

890
00:55:22,853 --> 00:55:24,534
but I just can't help it.

891
00:55:26,154 --> 00:55:27,244
So...

892
00:55:28,254 --> 00:55:30,974
just stay with me and let me hate you
for the rest of my life.

893
00:55:31,123 --> 00:55:32,213
Okay?

894
00:55:44,873 --> 00:55:46,574
(Tima Hair)

895
00:55:46,574 --> 00:55:48,844
Ji Young, it's a good thing
that you changed your hairstyle.

896
00:55:48,844 --> 00:55:50,114
You look like a real actress now.

897
00:55:50,114 --> 00:55:51,743
Gosh, Ji Young.

898
00:55:51,743 --> 00:55:54,963
You do look like a Seoul lady
with your new hairstyle.

899
00:55:55,214 --> 00:55:56,334
Do you really mean it?

900
00:55:58,384 --> 00:56:00,903
But this doesn't look like me.

901
00:56:03,163 --> 00:56:06,914
But do you think the director
and writer will like this?

902
00:56:06,993 --> 00:56:10,079
Of course.
You look amazing, seriously.

903
00:56:10,103 --> 00:56:11,514
You're the best.

904
00:56:19,773 --> 00:56:20,944
Oh, right.

905
00:56:20,944 --> 00:56:23,434
You go on ahead.
I left something in the car.

906
00:56:23,784 --> 00:56:25,034
- Okay.
- See you.

907
00:56:40,933 --> 00:56:42,843
Hello, Director Ko.

908
00:56:46,103 --> 00:56:47,684
Ji Young,
you've changed your hairstyle.

909
00:56:48,103 --> 00:56:49,134
And you're not wearing your glasses.

910
00:56:49,134 --> 00:56:50,454
Right.

911
00:56:50,773 --> 00:56:53,293
Ms. Kim told me to change my style.

912
00:56:55,813 --> 00:56:57,293
I hope she will like it.

913
00:56:58,583 --> 00:57:01,363
Do I look like the character
from "Seoul Lady?"

914
00:57:02,284 --> 00:57:04,073
I'm sure Ms. Kim will like it.

915
00:57:10,023 --> 00:57:11,113
Ji Young?

916
00:57:12,964 --> 00:57:14,194
- My goodness.
- Hello.

917
00:57:14,194 --> 00:57:16,703
- You did change your style.
- Yes.

918
00:57:16,703 --> 00:57:19,784
You are perfect for the character.
I love it.

919
00:57:20,333 --> 00:57:21,883
You look great
without the glasses on.

920
00:57:23,103 --> 00:57:25,203
Ji Young and Kang Bin.

921
00:57:25,203 --> 00:57:28,463
I can tell you two have
good chemistry going on.

922
00:57:28,543 --> 00:57:30,889
I feel like we're coming up
with good stories already.

923
00:57:30,913 --> 00:57:32,034
Right, Director Ko?

924
00:57:32,813 --> 00:57:35,104
You do have good chemistry,
so I look forward to it.

925
00:57:35,714 --> 00:57:37,583
It's a story
about a North Korean spy...

926
00:57:37,583 --> 00:57:38,804
disguised as a fashion designer.

927
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:41,453
So there will be many action scenes
for you, Ji Young.

928
00:57:41,453 --> 00:57:44,113
We need you to train hard
at the action school before the shoot.

929
00:57:44,964 --> 00:57:46,983
Okay. I will.

930
00:57:53,234 --> 00:57:55,383
(Goban Restaurant)

931
00:58:02,514 --> 00:58:04,133
What is this on your shirt?

932
00:58:08,683 --> 00:58:11,003
I can't believe I fell for that jerk.

933
00:58:11,723 --> 00:58:15,403
Hey, Ko Myung Dong.
You have such a bad taste in men.

934
00:58:17,723 --> 00:58:19,644
By the way, what's with Do Sik?

935
00:58:20,094 --> 00:58:22,134
After getting caught in the act,

936
00:58:22,134 --> 00:58:24,084
he hasn't even called me.

937
00:58:26,433 --> 00:58:29,224
Fine. I'll just get over it.

938
00:58:30,504 --> 00:58:31,854
Darn it.

939
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:34,963
Grandma.

940
00:58:36,273 --> 00:58:39,444
Ma Ri. You're here.

941
00:58:39,444 --> 00:58:41,764
My dear Ma Ri.

942
00:58:42,813 --> 00:58:44,034
Have you been well?

943
00:58:44,123 --> 00:58:45,173
Yes.

944
00:58:50,393 --> 00:58:54,213
Look at you. You seem to like meat.

945
00:58:54,493 --> 00:58:56,084
All right. Have some more.

946
00:58:56,163 --> 00:58:58,814
Take your time and eat a lot.

947
00:58:59,464 --> 00:59:02,284
You should eat meat
when you feel low on energy.

948
00:59:03,034 --> 00:59:06,293
Okay, Grandma.
This is really delicious.

949
00:59:07,214 --> 00:59:09,543
Your parents didn't divorce,

950
00:59:09,543 --> 00:59:11,444
and you got better.

951
00:59:11,444 --> 00:59:13,834
So I can finally sleep
with my feet stretched out.

952
00:59:14,054 --> 00:59:17,503
Okay. Grandma,
this is all thanks to Pil Seung.

953
00:59:17,623 --> 00:59:18,673
What?

954
00:59:19,083 --> 00:59:20,744
Thanks to Pil Seung?

955
00:59:20,893 --> 00:59:24,543
Yes. I got better
thanks to Pil Seung.

956
00:59:25,324 --> 00:59:27,943
I started eating and going
for a walk because of him.

957
00:59:27,993 --> 00:59:30,454
That's how I got better.

958
00:59:31,663 --> 00:59:33,933
Grandma, thank you...

959
00:59:33,933 --> 00:59:37,394
for letting him come to see me
when I was ill.

960
00:59:38,344 --> 00:59:41,423
It's not that I let him go,

961
00:59:42,174 --> 00:59:43,494
but I'm glad anyway.

962
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:46,164
Is your mom all right?

963
00:59:46,554 --> 00:59:49,764
Yes. She is okay now.
Everything is good.

964
00:59:50,123 --> 00:59:51,123
Oh, dear.

965
00:59:51,123 --> 00:59:54,204
I'm really glad to hear that.

966
00:59:54,493 --> 00:59:57,599
Staying married is a lot better
than getting divorced.

967
00:59:57,623 --> 01:00:00,883
Right. So I'm feeling really happy.

968
01:00:01,333 --> 01:00:02,514
To be honest,

969
01:00:02,833 --> 01:00:06,364
I was afraid
my mom and dad would get divorced.

970
01:00:06,364 --> 01:00:08,473
My gosh. I understand.

971
01:00:08,473 --> 01:00:12,574
I'm sure they won't get divorced
because of you, Ma Ri.

972
01:00:12,574 --> 01:00:13,949
Don't worry.

973
01:00:13,973 --> 01:00:17,264
Ma Ri, take your time and eat a lot.

974
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:19,564
And refresh yourself.

975
01:00:20,214 --> 01:00:21,304
I will.

976
01:00:31,223 --> 01:00:32,273
No.

977
01:00:34,393 --> 01:00:37,153
Ae Kyo does need to be cautious.

978
01:00:38,634 --> 01:00:39,684
But...

979
01:00:40,074 --> 01:00:41,753
why do I have to leave the country?

980
01:00:42,504 --> 01:00:45,554
I like this place.
It's my friend's house.

981
01:00:47,043 --> 01:00:48,264
Oh, and Sang Gu.

982
01:00:49,114 --> 01:00:50,944
Don't go around...

983
01:00:50,944 --> 01:00:54,164
telling anyone
that Jin Dan looks like your father.

984
01:00:54,754 --> 01:00:56,304
It's weird.

985
01:00:56,453 --> 01:00:58,334
What if someone were to get ideas?

986
01:01:00,393 --> 01:01:01,903
Why did she say such a thing?

987
01:01:02,654 --> 01:01:04,414
It's really strange.

988
01:01:06,264 --> 01:01:07,343
Is that...

989
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:11,184
why Ae Kyo wants me
to go to the Philippines?

990
01:01:22,174 --> 01:01:23,224
Yes.

991
01:01:33,453 --> 01:01:34,573
Mr. Ko.

992
01:01:35,393 --> 01:01:37,874
Thank you for what you did for me
the other day.

993
01:01:39,523 --> 01:01:41,644
I know it was a lot to ask,

994
01:01:42,364 --> 01:01:44,253
but you offered me an advance.

995
01:01:44,833 --> 01:01:47,954
It was the money
you were going to receive anyway.

996
01:01:48,404 --> 01:01:49,584
It's no big deal.

997
01:01:50,944 --> 01:01:54,264
I will work really hard
on this project of "Seoul Lady."

998
01:01:55,074 --> 01:01:57,183
I'll make sure to practice
the North Korean accent...

999
01:01:57,183 --> 01:01:59,633
and train hard at the action school.

1000
01:02:00,614 --> 01:02:01,664
Okay.

1001
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:04,123
If there's anything else you need,

1002
01:02:04,123 --> 01:02:05,673
you can always tell me.

1003
01:02:06,054 --> 01:02:07,104
Okay.

1004
01:02:08,493 --> 01:02:09,773
Thank you.

1005
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:14,443
Wait, Ji Young.

1006
01:02:27,413 --> 01:02:28,564
This is for you.

1007
01:02:33,853 --> 01:02:35,503
What is this?

1008
01:02:36,254 --> 01:02:38,834
I bought it for you
when I went to Paris.

1009
01:02:39,453 --> 01:02:40,673
But I had no chance to give it
to you.

1010
01:02:41,293 --> 01:02:43,273
I bought this for you anyway,

1011
01:02:43,464 --> 01:02:45,014
so I don't want to give it
to someone else.

1012
01:02:45,924 --> 01:02:48,314
Don't feel pressured
and just take it.

1013
01:02:54,034 --> 01:02:55,584
Okay. Thank you.

1014
01:02:59,174 --> 01:03:00,863
I should get going then.

1015
01:03:36,913 --> 01:03:39,733
(Go Action School)

1016
01:03:46,123 --> 01:03:48,744
Ji Young, you already did it once,
so just keep at it.

1017
01:03:49,054 --> 01:03:50,113
Sure.

1018
01:03:57,534 --> 01:03:59,864
Gosh, Mr. Ko. You're here.

1019
01:03:59,864 --> 01:04:01,074
I see you're working hard.

1020
01:04:01,074 --> 01:04:02,323
Well, it's not a hassle.

1021
01:04:02,373 --> 01:04:03,923
Thank you for these.

1022
01:04:04,944 --> 01:04:06,844
She's practicing the scene...

1023
01:04:06,844 --> 01:04:08,743
where she jumps
while making her escape.

1024
01:04:08,743 --> 01:04:10,093
- I see.
- Right.

1025
01:04:10,514 --> 01:04:11,990
- You should stay and watch.
- Sure.

1026
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:13,664
Hey, that's not how you do it.

1027
01:04:20,393 --> 01:04:21,443
Give that to me.

1028
01:04:32,364 --> 01:04:33,414
Ji Young!

1029
01:04:37,404 --> 01:04:41,064
Don't leave me by myself
even if it's to go to the restroom.

1030
01:04:45,813 --> 01:04:46,863
Ji Young.

1031
01:04:47,813 --> 01:04:48,903
Ji Young?

1032
01:04:52,484 --> 01:04:54,673
Ji Young, are you all right?

(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1034
01:05:41,811 --> 01:05:44,681
What? Why would you say
such nonsense?

1035
01:05:44,681 --> 01:05:46,081
I said you were wrong.

1036
01:05:46,081 --> 01:05:48,652
I should go see
CEO Gong myself, then.

1038
01:05:49,782 --> 01:05:51,282
is at the APP building, am I correct?

1039
01:05:51,282 --> 01:05:53,031
If it's all right with you,

1040
01:05:53,121 --> 01:05:55,028
I'd like us to eat
at a place familiar to us...

1041
01:05:55,052 --> 01:05:57,621
so that I can tell you
about how you were as Do Ra.

1042
01:05:57,621 --> 01:06:00,132
Kim Ji Young, are you dating us
at the same time?

1043
01:06:00,132 --> 01:06:01,481
What do you think you're doing?

1044
01:06:01,561 --> 01:06:02,762
Why are you dating a man like him?

1045
01:06:02,762 --> 01:06:04,781
When will you finally stop
dating someone like him?

1046
01:06:05,831 --> 01:06:07,381
You regained another memory,
didn't you?

1047
01:06:07,672 --> 01:06:09,022
What did you remember?

1048
01:06:09,132 --> 01:06:10,452
On the day I died,

1049
01:06:10,742 --> 01:06:12,622
I went to see you.
