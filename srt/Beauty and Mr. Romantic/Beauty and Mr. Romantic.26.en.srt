(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,720
Hey.

00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,720
(GOGO Entertainment
Foundation Ceremony)

4
00:00:17,504 --> 00:00:19,234
You impertinent punk.

5
00:00:19,975 --> 00:00:21,275
What did you just say to me?

6
00:00:21,545 --> 00:00:23,775
Human trash?

7
00:00:28,684 --> 00:00:29,744
Hey.

8
00:00:30,814 --> 00:00:31,915
Who are you throwing punches at?

9
00:00:41,163 --> 00:00:43,534
How are you not human trash
when you went...

10
00:00:43,534 --> 00:00:45,594
after another woman
while engaged to someone else?

11
00:00:46,134 --> 00:00:47,564
No decent man would do that.

12
00:00:48,873 --> 00:00:51,204
Whether I date
more than one woman...

13
00:00:51,644 --> 00:00:53,003
is none of your business.

14
00:00:53,513 --> 00:00:55,104
I showed interest in Ji Young first.

15
00:00:56,744 --> 00:00:58,874
You're the one
who took my girl from me!

16
00:01:06,924 --> 00:01:08,424
Darn it.

17
00:01:11,934 --> 00:01:14,033
How dare you take what's mine?

18
00:01:14,033 --> 00:01:15,623
Kim Ji Young is mine!

19
00:01:21,703 --> 00:01:22,933
Pil Seung!

20
00:01:23,373 --> 00:01:25,190
Don't hit my brother.

21
00:01:25,214 --> 00:01:26,274
Darn you.

22
00:01:26,274 --> 00:01:28,244
- Pil Seung!
- Don't hit my brother.

23
00:01:28,244 --> 00:01:30,403
Pil Seung's my brother!

24
00:01:32,854 --> 00:01:34,313
Stop hitting him.

25
00:01:35,324 --> 00:01:37,284
Don't!

26
00:01:38,854 --> 00:01:41,683
- That's my brother!
- Darn!

27
00:01:42,494 --> 00:01:44,423
Stop hitting him.

28
00:01:44,423 --> 00:01:46,694
Get off him!

29
00:01:46,694 --> 00:01:49,224
Don't hit him.

30
00:01:49,464 --> 00:01:50,464
- Stop!
- Ma Ri.

31
00:01:50,464 --> 00:01:51,834
What is going on?

32
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:56,963
What is the meaning of this?

33
00:02:00,544 --> 00:02:03,173
Pil Seung, are you all right?
Oh, no.

34
00:02:04,313 --> 00:02:07,453
- Pil Seung!
- Why were you two going at it?

35
00:02:07,453 --> 00:02:09,283
Were you throwing punches...

36
00:02:09,283 --> 00:02:11,653
over that tenant of ours?

37
00:02:12,153 --> 00:02:13,593
Unbelievable.

38
00:02:13,593 --> 00:02:17,124
Why on earth
are you fighting over...

39
00:02:17,124 --> 00:02:19,654
that country bumpkin?
I can't believe you.

40
00:02:20,493 --> 00:02:23,523
Jin Dan,
don't you ever contact me again.

41
00:02:24,263 --> 00:02:25,664
We're done.

42
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:29,179
- But...
- Tae Hee!

43
00:02:29,203 --> 00:02:32,534
What... What just happened?

44
00:02:32,613 --> 00:02:33,773
My gosh.

45
00:02:33,773 --> 00:02:35,814
Auntie!

46
00:02:35,814 --> 00:02:38,173
Are you all right?

47
00:03:00,074 --> 00:03:02,374
Auntie Dae Sook, how could you?

48
00:03:02,374 --> 00:03:04,464
I know you're angry,
but how could you slap him?

49
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,243
They say one's roots never lie.

50
00:03:07,243 --> 00:03:10,573
This is exactly why you're only seen
as the mistress' son.

51
00:03:11,953 --> 00:03:13,013
Auntie!

52
00:03:13,483 --> 00:03:16,743
How dare you yell at me
after humiliating this family?

53
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:20,553
Don't you know
how prestigious Illyu Foods is?

54
00:03:21,194 --> 00:03:23,124
How could you
humiliate our family name...

55
00:03:23,124 --> 00:03:25,094
after what I did
to set her up with you?

56
00:03:25,433 --> 00:03:29,164
And at the foundation ceremony
of your sister-in-law's new company!

57
00:03:29,164 --> 00:03:30,564
You imbecile!

58
00:03:32,574 --> 00:03:33,634
Jin Taek,

59
00:03:34,374 --> 00:03:37,203
he should never have gotten
Angel Investment Corp.

60
00:03:37,904 --> 00:03:40,534
How can I show my face around
after this?

61
00:03:42,414 --> 00:03:45,874
Auntie Dae Sook, I'm terribly sorry.
I'll talk to him.

62
00:03:46,854 --> 00:03:48,814
I don't care how clueless you are.

63
00:03:49,324 --> 00:03:51,224
How dare you chase
after another woman...

64
00:03:51,224 --> 00:03:53,324
when you're set
to marry someone else?

65
00:03:53,324 --> 00:03:54,983
On top of that, she's already taken.

66
00:03:55,863 --> 00:03:57,553
I'm disgusted.

67
00:04:00,433 --> 00:04:02,634
Uncle, I'll also say something.

68
00:04:02,634 --> 00:04:05,004
Hurt Pil Seung like that again,

69
00:04:05,004 --> 00:04:06,564
and I'll make you pay.

70
00:04:07,874 --> 00:04:08,964
Gong Ma Ri, you!

71
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,233
How could you side with him
and not your own uncle?

72
00:04:12,314 --> 00:04:14,983
My brother Pil Seung, you say?

73
00:04:14,983 --> 00:04:16,803
It's not like
he's your actual brother.

74
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,754
Something is seriously wrong
with her.

75
00:04:18,754 --> 00:04:19,784
Soo Yeon,

76
00:04:19,784 --> 00:04:22,184
why aren't you saying anything
when she's talking nonsense?

77
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,644
Right. I'll go to her.

78
00:04:24,923 --> 00:04:28,084
She's a fool
who does the most foolish things.

79
00:04:30,764 --> 00:04:31,894
See?

80
00:04:32,794 --> 00:04:35,133
Even Ma Ri thinks we're beneath her.

81
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:37,063
What now?

82
00:04:37,633 --> 00:04:40,003
Your brother and aunt
think less of you now.

83
00:04:40,003 --> 00:04:42,563
How can you let the tower we built
crumble overnight?

84
00:04:43,003 --> 00:04:45,173
Would you rather see me die?

85
00:04:45,173 --> 00:04:48,784
Kneel before your aunt and brother
and beg for forgiveness.

86
00:04:48,784 --> 00:04:51,084
Say that you'll clean up this mess.

87
00:04:51,084 --> 00:04:52,313
This instant!

88
00:04:54,284 --> 00:04:55,414
Darn it!

89
00:04:55,823 --> 00:04:59,154
Jin Dan!
Where do you think you're going?

90
00:05:00,854 --> 00:05:02,024
My gosh.

91
00:05:03,664 --> 00:05:06,724
Ma Ri, look at me.

92
00:05:09,733 --> 00:05:11,394
You said it earlier...

93
00:05:11,873 --> 00:05:14,534
and at the event hall
with all those people around you.

94
00:05:15,243 --> 00:05:18,003
How can you call Pil Seung
your brother?

95
00:05:18,003 --> 00:05:20,104
What if people figure it out?

96
00:05:20,573 --> 00:05:23,373
How could I stay put while
Uncle and my brother went at it?

97
00:05:24,243 --> 00:05:26,714
I won't let anyone
treat him that way.

98
00:05:26,714 --> 00:05:28,553
Not even Uncle.

99
00:05:28,553 --> 00:05:30,813
But if you keep at it,

100
00:05:32,794 --> 00:05:36,183
people will figure out
that he's actually your brother.

101
00:05:37,224 --> 00:05:40,493
I explained
how that would be a problem.

102
00:05:41,334 --> 00:05:42,834
Your father,

103
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:45,433
Sun Young, and even Pil Seung.

104
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:49,303
It'll shock everyone
and make them miserable.

105
00:05:49,673 --> 00:05:50,834
I know.

106
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,774
But don't worry, Mom.

107
00:05:53,774 --> 00:05:55,344
Even if I keep calling him
my brother,

108
00:05:55,344 --> 00:05:56,714
no one will figure it out.

109
00:05:56,714 --> 00:05:58,844
They'll just think
that's because I like him.

110
00:06:00,284 --> 00:06:02,024
A story like abandoning a child
at a friend's house...

111
00:06:02,024 --> 00:06:03,753
isn't even written for TV.

112
00:06:03,753 --> 00:06:07,493
So no one will even think to imagine
that Pil Seung is your son...

113
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:10,053
that you abandoned.

114
00:06:13,964 --> 00:06:16,693
The concerns are all in your head.

115
00:06:17,063 --> 00:06:19,493
Mom. Do you know
what people say about that?

116
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:21,293
"A guilty conscience
needs no accuser."

117
00:06:27,474 --> 00:06:28,904
Oh, gosh.

118
00:06:30,214 --> 00:06:32,053
I had such a fright.

119
00:06:32,053 --> 00:06:34,983
My heart's still pounding.

120
00:06:35,183 --> 00:06:38,414
Do you think it makes sense that...

121
00:06:38,553 --> 00:06:41,693
two perfectly fine men
would fight over...

122
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,454
that country bumpkin?

123
00:06:43,524 --> 00:06:44,883
It doesn't.

124
00:06:44,993 --> 00:06:47,024
Forget about Pil Seung.

125
00:06:47,294 --> 00:06:49,933
That Mr. Gong
comes from a rich family.

126
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:51,493
He even has a fiancée.

127
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:54,573
And he went and started a fight
during an event to celebrate...

128
00:06:54,573 --> 00:06:56,303
his sister-in-law
starting a business.

129
00:06:56,303 --> 00:06:58,733
What kind of mess is that?

130
00:06:59,014 --> 00:07:02,003
I think the other guy was crazier.

131
00:07:02,644 --> 00:07:05,243
The woman he was supposed to marry.

132
00:07:05,414 --> 00:07:06,813
She was furious.

133
00:07:07,113 --> 00:07:08,454
Why wouldn't she be?

134
00:07:08,454 --> 00:07:10,414
She looked so elegant and pretty.

135
00:07:11,084 --> 00:07:14,954
I'm not surprised she went,
"Don't you ever contact me again."

136
00:07:15,264 --> 00:07:16,724
I'd have said the same.

137
00:07:16,863 --> 00:07:19,793
Our Pil Seung is not the type
to fight over nothing.

138
00:07:19,964 --> 00:07:22,580
That's what I'm talking about.

139
00:07:22,604 --> 00:07:25,133
What on earth
did that country bumpkin do...

140
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:28,433
that two grown men
got into a fist fight?

141
00:07:29,204 --> 00:07:30,264
Gosh.

142
00:07:31,974 --> 00:07:33,574
Welcome back.

143
00:07:33,844 --> 00:07:34,974
Miss.

144
00:07:35,514 --> 00:07:37,574
Watch how you act in public.

145
00:07:37,844 --> 00:07:39,943
Do you know what just happened?

146
00:07:40,683 --> 00:07:41,743
What?

147
00:07:42,154 --> 00:07:43,214
Grandma.

148
00:07:43,954 --> 00:07:46,813
Why are you yelling at her?
What did she do wrong?

149
00:07:47,354 --> 00:07:48,753
What happened?

150
00:07:50,224 --> 00:07:52,824
My gosh. What happened to your face?

151
00:07:53,233 --> 00:07:54,423
It's nothing.

152
00:07:54,464 --> 00:07:56,293
How is it nothing?

153
00:07:56,404 --> 00:07:58,704
Because of you, at the opening,

154
00:07:58,704 --> 00:08:01,673
some guy called Mr. Gong
and Pil Seung got into a fight,

155
00:08:01,673 --> 00:08:03,803
and look what happened to his face!

156
00:08:03,803 --> 00:08:04,974
Is that true?

157
00:08:04,974 --> 00:08:06,733
No. Come with me, Ji Young.

158
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:09,719
Miss!

159
00:08:09,743 --> 00:08:12,313
Are you going around
flirting with everyone?

160
00:08:12,954 --> 00:08:14,344
She isn't, Grandma.

161
00:08:14,914 --> 00:08:16,683
Ji Young's not that kind of person!

162
00:08:16,854 --> 00:08:18,753
- Oh, no.
- Ko Pil Seung.

163
00:08:18,753 --> 00:08:21,053
How dare you
shout at your grandmother?

164
00:08:21,053 --> 00:08:23,594
- What should we do with him?
- Oh, gosh.

165
00:08:23,594 --> 00:08:26,633
He has completely lost his mind.

166
00:08:26,633 --> 00:08:27,923
This is driving me crazy.

167
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:33,193
You throw punches over nothing now.

168
00:08:33,604 --> 00:08:36,704
I didn't know
you were that ignorant a person.

169
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,934
Mr. Gong attacked me first.
I had no choice.

170
00:08:40,173 --> 00:08:42,003
You should've held back.

171
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:44,143
You should've gotten away.

172
00:08:44,813 --> 00:08:46,444
Mr. Gong's a weirdo.

173
00:08:46,614 --> 00:08:49,814
Fighting him
will make you a weirdo too.

174
00:08:50,453 --> 00:08:52,929
It was a company opening ceremony.

175
00:08:52,953 --> 00:08:55,264
You did that in front of everyone
and their families.

176
00:08:55,264 --> 00:08:57,224
What do you think
they'd think of me now?

177
00:08:57,994 --> 00:09:01,153
I thought you were
rational and wise.

178
00:09:01,264 --> 00:09:02,893
I'm so disappointed.

179
00:09:03,504 --> 00:09:06,404
Mr. Gong was talking nonsense
about you in public...

180
00:09:06,404 --> 00:09:08,404
and being rude and I should've...

181
00:09:08,404 --> 00:09:09,679
let that all slide?

182
00:09:09,703 --> 00:09:11,604
Do you want me
to be that kind of person?

183
00:09:12,244 --> 00:09:14,544
You say you fought him for me,

184
00:09:14,544 --> 00:09:17,574
but why don't you see
the more you do that,

185
00:09:17,984 --> 00:09:19,429
the worse it makes me look?

186
00:09:19,453 --> 00:09:22,613
You yelled at your grandma
because she said something about me.

187
00:09:23,254 --> 00:09:25,513
Do you think that would help me?

188
00:09:27,624 --> 00:09:30,600
I didn't yell at my grandma
out of anger.

189
00:09:30,624 --> 00:09:32,994
She was being unfair,
so I spoke loudly.

190
00:09:32,994 --> 00:09:35,023
She was being so unreasonable.

191
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:39,393
Okay.

192
00:09:40,103 --> 00:09:42,903
I'll be more careful from now on.
I acted a bit too rashly today.

193
00:09:44,103 --> 00:09:45,334
No.

194
00:09:46,244 --> 00:09:49,189
It's all on clumsy, stupid me...

195
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,873
who spilled coffee
on Mr. Gong's suit.

196
00:09:52,313 --> 00:09:54,083
To avoid buying him a new suit,

197
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,483
I agreed to eat out with him,
so it's my fault.

198
00:09:56,984 --> 00:09:58,814
Who could I blame?

199
00:10:01,254 --> 00:10:04,724
Talking about that with you
will only frustrate me even more.

200
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,309
Wait, Ji Young.

201
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,863
Don't follow me.
I can't stand your face right now.

202
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,493
This is bad.

203
00:10:13,734 --> 00:10:15,434
She's really angry.

204
00:10:16,803 --> 00:10:18,163
What should I do now?

205
00:10:21,713 --> 00:10:22,873
Ji Young.

206
00:10:25,114 --> 00:10:26,214
Ji Young.

207
00:10:28,384 --> 00:10:30,814
I brought tteokbokki.
It's your favorite.

208
00:10:31,183 --> 00:10:32,413
Let me in.

209
00:10:34,193 --> 00:10:36,883
Forget it. I don't want it.

210
00:10:38,664 --> 00:10:41,924
Ji Young.
It's okay to blame and hate me,

211
00:10:42,664 --> 00:10:45,233
but eat the innocent tteokbokki.

212
00:10:47,203 --> 00:10:48,903
I'll leave it out here.

213
00:10:49,744 --> 00:10:50,943
Eat it while it's hot.

214
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:53,204
It'll get all soggy
when it's cold, okay?

215
00:11:06,693 --> 00:11:08,253
Did he really leave...

216
00:11:09,323 --> 00:11:10,454
the tteokbokki outside?

217
00:11:14,894 --> 00:11:18,224
He's right.
The tteokbokki's innocent.

218
00:11:19,073 --> 00:11:21,263
It's wrong to let it
get cold and soggy.

219
00:11:27,213 --> 00:11:28,334
My gosh.

220
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,204
What are you doing?

221
00:11:31,414 --> 00:11:33,344
You said you'd leave the tteokbokki.

222
00:11:33,683 --> 00:11:35,413
Did you just con me?

223
00:11:40,193 --> 00:11:43,023
What do you think you're doing?

224
00:11:44,963 --> 00:11:46,753
I couldn't stand listening to...

225
00:11:47,994 --> 00:11:50,993
Mr. Gong say things about you
that were total lies.

226
00:11:53,203 --> 00:11:54,564
But from now on,

227
00:11:55,303 --> 00:11:56,763
I'll hold back.

228
00:11:57,603 --> 00:11:59,804
Even if Mr. Gong punches me again,

229
00:12:00,274 --> 00:12:03,544
instead of fighting him,
I'll avoid him or get away.

230
00:12:04,284 --> 00:12:05,474
Will that do?

231
00:12:10,384 --> 00:12:11,883
I was careless today.

232
00:12:12,923 --> 00:12:14,113
I apologize.

233
00:12:16,063 --> 00:12:17,224
It's fine.

234
00:12:18,364 --> 00:12:19,753
I should apologize.

235
00:12:21,294 --> 00:12:24,064
No. I should apologize.

236
00:12:25,933 --> 00:12:28,763
Okay, then. We're same-same.

237
00:12:32,713 --> 00:12:34,733
We're what? "Same-same?"

238
00:12:35,284 --> 00:12:37,604
Yes. You don't know
it means we're even?

239
00:12:42,124 --> 00:12:43,544
What should we do about this?

240
00:12:44,423 --> 00:12:45,653
Blow on it for me.

241
00:12:48,254 --> 00:12:49,684
Go home.

242
00:13:12,053 --> 00:13:13,743
What kind of woman is she...

243
00:13:15,353 --> 00:13:17,044
that Pil Seung would fight over her?

244
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,633
Wait. Is that the woman?

245
00:13:38,144 --> 00:13:39,943
Is that the woman...

246
00:13:39,943 --> 00:13:42,304
Pil Seung and Jin Dan
were fighting over?

247
00:13:44,614 --> 00:13:45,674
Goodness.

248
00:13:48,553 --> 00:13:51,383
Soo Yeon. I'm sorry about yesterday.

249
00:13:52,853 --> 00:13:54,483
Our Pil Seung...

250
00:13:54,693 --> 00:13:57,523
did something dreadful
at an important event.

251
00:13:57,994 --> 00:14:00,694
Don't apologize.
My brother-in-law was at fault.

252
00:14:01,193 --> 00:14:03,824
No one in our family
blames Pil Seung.

253
00:14:04,603 --> 00:14:07,163
Yes. From what I heard,

254
00:14:07,603 --> 00:14:10,834
your brother-in-law
was the one who started the fight.

255
00:14:11,473 --> 00:14:14,133
Pil Seung was left with no choice.

256
00:14:15,713 --> 00:14:18,814
You never told me that Pil Seung...

257
00:14:19,553 --> 00:14:22,013
was seeing someone.

258
00:14:22,524 --> 00:14:26,084
How long has he been dating her?

259
00:14:27,953 --> 00:14:29,224
That woman...

260
00:14:29,764 --> 00:14:33,294
worked on Pil Seung's previous drama
as a crew member running errands.

261
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:36,164
She was from the country
and had nowhere to stay,

262
00:14:36,164 --> 00:14:38,464
so we let her rent our extra room.

263
00:14:39,303 --> 00:14:42,464
They must've gotten close
after Pil Seung let her carpool.

264
00:14:43,544 --> 00:14:46,273
And you didn't know about it?

265
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:50,204
I never imagined Pil Seung
would date her,

266
00:14:50,384 --> 00:14:52,214
so the thought
never crossed my mind.

267
00:14:52,614 --> 00:14:53,743
Gosh.

268
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,513
And to think...

269
00:14:55,683 --> 00:14:58,383
she two-timed him
with your brother-in-law.

270
00:14:58,624 --> 00:15:00,513
I can't stand it.

271
00:15:01,154 --> 00:15:04,364
Soo Yeon.
I was so upset and embarrassed.

272
00:15:04,364 --> 00:15:06,324
I couldn't even tell you about it.

273
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:10,663
So, will you just keep her around?

274
00:15:10,963 --> 00:15:14,263
Pil Seung can be stubborn and rigid.

275
00:15:14,904 --> 00:15:17,204
Once he thinks it's right
and makes a decision,

276
00:15:17,303 --> 00:15:19,903
he won't change his mind
no matter how much we object.

277
00:15:21,073 --> 00:15:23,414
I'm reluctant
to do anything in case...

278
00:15:23,414 --> 00:15:25,403
that fuels him to go even further.

279
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,353
You can't
leave them together, though.

280
00:15:27,353 --> 00:15:29,013
You have to stop him no matter what.

281
00:15:30,553 --> 00:15:34,153
It's not fair of me to criticize
someone else's daughter,

282
00:15:34,423 --> 00:15:37,724
but I don't think
she's a good match for Pil Seung.

283
00:15:38,723 --> 00:15:40,924
You didn't raise him this hard...

284
00:15:41,164 --> 00:15:43,064
to let him marry a girl like her.

285
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,163
Soo Yeon.

286
00:15:46,203 --> 00:15:49,863
Did you meet our tenant?

287
00:15:51,504 --> 00:15:54,733
Yes, while going to and fro
because of Ma Ri.

288
00:15:55,514 --> 00:15:56,704
I saw her briefly.

289
00:15:57,144 --> 00:15:58,674
Did you?

290
00:16:00,114 --> 00:16:03,714
Soo Yeon.
What should I do about Pil Seung?

291
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,613
I'm so upset and frustrated.

292
00:16:21,603 --> 00:16:23,663
Hey, Tae Hee. Come on in.

293
00:16:24,004 --> 00:16:25,004
Hello.

294
00:16:25,004 --> 00:16:27,350
Hi. Thank you for coming.

295
00:16:27,374 --> 00:16:28,604
Have a seat.

296
00:16:29,644 --> 00:16:31,944
I'm so touched
that I feel like crying.

297
00:16:33,053 --> 00:16:35,344
You've been nothing but nice to me.

298
00:16:35,984 --> 00:16:38,544
So I thought I should come here
and say a proper goodbye.

299
00:16:38,894 --> 00:16:40,524
What do you mean by
a proper goodbye?

300
00:16:40,524 --> 00:16:42,684
Why would you say that?
That's just upsetting.

301
00:16:43,494 --> 00:16:46,523
Tae Hee,
please don't be like this for me.

302
00:16:47,134 --> 00:16:49,724
And I think
there was a misunderstanding.

303
00:16:50,303 --> 00:16:52,433
Jin Dan wouldn't do such a thing
for someone else's girlfriend.

304
00:16:52,433 --> 00:16:54,094
It's not like
he got shot in the head.

305
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:58,363
He just pitied the country girl,
so he was being nice to her.

306
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:02,914
And apparently,
Director Ko was dating her.

307
00:17:02,914 --> 00:17:06,013
He just misunderstood Jin Dan
and picked up a fight.

308
00:17:06,683 --> 00:17:09,584
I heard the whole story,
and it was no big deal.

309
00:17:10,423 --> 00:17:13,524
If this makes you
end things with Jin Dan,

310
00:17:13,524 --> 00:17:15,623
I will be so frustrated.

311
00:17:16,623 --> 00:17:20,623
And it will deeply break
Jin Dan's heart.

312
00:17:22,363 --> 00:17:25,063
But still, he was involved
with someone else...

313
00:17:25,063 --> 00:17:28,633
and got into a fight
when he was engaged to me.

314
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:33,074
It's very disappointing,
and I just can't forgive him.

315
00:17:34,373 --> 00:17:35,903
I should get going, ma'am.

316
00:17:36,184 --> 00:17:37,373
Please take care.

317
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:38,613
Wait.

318
00:17:38,613 --> 00:17:41,643
Tae Hee.

319
00:17:45,254 --> 00:17:46,454
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

320
00:17:46,454 --> 00:17:48,084
What are you doing here?

321
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:50,824
Tae Hee came to see me
at the store earlier today.

322
00:17:51,893 --> 00:17:54,494
She did? What did she say?

323
00:17:54,494 --> 00:17:56,423
Though I asked her to come over,

324
00:17:56,734 --> 00:17:58,903
she said she came to say
a proper goodbye.

325
00:17:58,903 --> 00:18:00,363
That means
she still has feelings for you.

326
00:18:00,734 --> 00:18:02,704
And when I went out to see her off,

327
00:18:02,704 --> 00:18:04,433
her eyes were filled with tears.

328
00:18:04,803 --> 00:18:05,813
Are you sure?

329
00:18:05,813 --> 00:18:08,334
Yes. So you should go talk to her.

330
00:18:08,643 --> 00:18:10,443
Beg on your knees if you have to.

331
00:18:10,684 --> 00:18:13,389
Otherwise, your life
will be just pathetic.

332
00:18:13,413 --> 00:18:14,913
You have to win Tae Hee back
no matter what...

333
00:18:14,913 --> 00:18:17,683
and make Jin Taek
and Auntie Dae Sook change their minds.

334
00:18:18,123 --> 00:18:19,453
I'll go talk to her.

335
00:18:20,024 --> 00:18:22,964
I told Tae Hee
that darn brat was clinging to you.

336
00:18:22,964 --> 00:18:25,194
So make up some story
to cover it up, okay?

337
00:18:25,194 --> 00:18:26,593
Okay. I get it.

338
00:18:26,593 --> 00:18:28,754
I understand. You should go now.

339
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,804
By the way, can I ask you something?

340
00:18:36,343 --> 00:18:37,944
Why did you
fall for a girl like her?

341
00:18:37,944 --> 00:18:39,574
I'm really curious.

342
00:18:39,843 --> 00:18:41,034
Come on, Mom.

343
00:18:42,113 --> 00:18:44,004
I just don't get it.

344
00:18:45,653 --> 00:18:48,143
Is it something like this?

345
00:18:48,714 --> 00:18:50,424
Is it like
you chase anything in a skirt?

346
00:18:50,424 --> 00:18:51,424
Mom!

347
00:18:51,424 --> 00:18:54,454
I wouldn't be saying this
if she was someone in your league.

348
00:18:54,454 --> 00:18:56,063
But I hate even mentioning her.

349
00:18:56,063 --> 00:18:58,484
I can't bear to lift my head
from embarrassment.

350
00:19:06,303 --> 00:19:08,234
Fine, Pil Seung.

351
00:19:08,234 --> 00:19:10,004
You've already made up your mind.

352
00:19:10,744 --> 00:19:13,304
I hope you will succeed, okay?

353
00:19:14,313 --> 00:19:15,504
Yes. Thank you.

354
00:19:15,883 --> 00:19:17,514
And make sure...

355
00:19:17,514 --> 00:19:19,913
to come to our broadcasting company
when you start a new project.

356
00:19:19,913 --> 00:19:21,074
Of course.

357
00:19:21,454 --> 00:19:22,984
No matter where I work,

358
00:19:22,984 --> 00:19:25,424
I will never forget
that this company is my home.

359
00:19:25,424 --> 00:19:27,683
Right. You should never forget that.

360
00:19:28,323 --> 00:19:31,984
And if you have
any concerns or difficulties,

361
00:19:32,294 --> 00:19:34,494
come and talk to me anytime.

362
00:19:35,363 --> 00:19:37,103
- I will.
- Oh, right.

363
00:19:37,103 --> 00:19:39,133
Before you leave, make sure...

364
00:19:39,133 --> 00:19:41,573
to get things properly done
as you always do.

365
00:19:41,573 --> 00:19:43,343
You're going on a business trip
to Paris in two days.

366
00:19:43,343 --> 00:19:45,244
Your work is nominated
for the Juniper Award.

367
00:19:45,244 --> 00:19:46,504
You have to go.

368
00:19:46,913 --> 00:19:48,843
And I want to go sightseeing...

369
00:19:48,843 --> 00:19:51,304
in Paris thanks to you.

370
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,344
Of course, I'm going.

371
00:19:53,383 --> 00:19:55,244
("Don't Lie")

372
00:20:00,924 --> 00:20:02,593
You've worked really hard.

373
00:20:02,593 --> 00:20:04,464
Once you get settled in,

374
00:20:04,464 --> 00:20:06,723
you should bring me in too.

375
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:08,193
Okay.

376
00:20:08,934 --> 00:20:11,794
Oh, dear. I can't believe
I won't be able to see you tomorrow.

377
00:20:12,234 --> 00:20:14,534
I feel like
I'm losing my own child, Pil Seung.

378
00:20:15,174 --> 00:20:17,044
Stop being so dramatic.

379
00:20:17,044 --> 00:20:18,633
I'm serious.

380
00:20:19,073 --> 00:20:21,373
Okay. I'll come often.

381
00:20:21,714 --> 00:20:23,343
You should come to my office
for some tea.

382
00:20:23,343 --> 00:20:24,684
Of course, I will.

383
00:20:24,684 --> 00:20:26,744
Just don't tell me
not to come too often.

384
00:20:27,883 --> 00:20:30,083
All right. Thank you, everyone.

385
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,254
I appreciate your hard work.
Thank you.

386
00:20:32,254 --> 00:20:34,883
- Thank you.
- Good luck!

387
00:20:36,393 --> 00:20:37,524
Go, Ko Pil Seung!

388
00:20:37,724 --> 00:20:38,994
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

389
00:20:38,994 --> 00:20:40,594
- Good luck.
- Let's go.

390
00:20:41,863 --> 00:20:43,994
I have mixed feelings.

391
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,244
Thank you.

392
00:21:06,853 --> 00:21:08,883
What should I do with this jerk?

393
00:21:09,724 --> 00:21:11,223
I can't punch him again.

394
00:21:12,294 --> 00:21:13,623
Darn it.

395
00:21:22,684 --> 00:21:23,744
My gosh.

396
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,183
Is this really my office?

397
00:21:27,254 --> 00:21:28,784
It's huge.

398
00:21:30,353 --> 00:21:31,484
Director Ko.

399
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:34,533
What do you think?
Do you like your office?

400
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:35,923
I took extra special care of it.

401
00:21:36,593 --> 00:21:39,024
Ms. Jang, is this really my office?

402
00:21:40,004 --> 00:21:41,603
My office doesn't
need to be this big.

403
00:21:41,603 --> 00:21:42,904
This is too much.

404
00:21:42,904 --> 00:21:44,543
What do you mean it's too much?

405
00:21:44,543 --> 00:21:46,303
This is what you deserve.

406
00:21:46,303 --> 00:21:49,304
You are the main director
of our company.

407
00:21:51,283 --> 00:21:53,673
Why? Do you not like it?

408
00:21:55,553 --> 00:21:57,113
Of course I like it, but...

409
00:21:57,113 --> 00:21:58,684
Then it's no problem.

410
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:01,653
I just want you to make
good drama series here.

411
00:22:03,994 --> 00:22:05,194
Thank you.

412
00:22:05,194 --> 00:22:07,494
I will pour my soul into my work...

413
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:08,863
and try my best.

414
00:22:08,863 --> 00:22:11,423
Okay.
I look forward to it, Director Ko.

415
00:22:13,603 --> 00:22:16,004
Oh, right. Didn't you say...

416
00:22:16,004 --> 00:22:18,573
that there was a script
you had in mind?

417
00:22:18,573 --> 00:22:21,474
Yes. I'm torn between two works.

418
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:23,103
I'll tell you once it's settled.

419
00:22:23,214 --> 00:22:26,184
Then I want to start
the casting process right away.

420
00:22:26,184 --> 00:22:27,714
It's hard to find
good actors these days.

421
00:22:27,914 --> 00:22:29,083
Okay.

422
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:31,283
I'm just enthusiastic,
but I don't know much about this.

423
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:33,053
You take care of everything.

424
00:22:33,053 --> 00:22:35,254
I will just trust you
and do as you say.

425
00:22:35,553 --> 00:22:38,623
I'll just try my best
to support you.

426
00:22:38,664 --> 00:22:41,524
Thank you. I'll make this work.

427
00:22:44,234 --> 00:22:46,064
- You should unpack.
- Okay.

428
00:22:47,303 --> 00:22:48,693
Oh, right.

429
00:22:51,873 --> 00:22:54,133
Your mom seemed very concerned.

430
00:22:54,543 --> 00:22:55,603
What?

431
00:22:56,944 --> 00:23:00,274
I heard about the tenant lady.

432
00:23:02,484 --> 00:23:03,913
I see.

433
00:23:04,524 --> 00:23:06,154
I heard about it,

434
00:23:06,154 --> 00:23:09,784
and I don't think it is a good idea
for you to go out with her.

435
00:23:12,464 --> 00:23:14,863
I understand
you might be offended...

436
00:23:14,863 --> 00:23:17,494
to hear something like this from me.

437
00:23:17,934 --> 00:23:20,623
But I've seen you
since you were little.

438
00:23:21,373 --> 00:23:25,004
You're like my son,
so I'm just worried about you.

439
00:23:27,514 --> 00:23:29,813
I can't explain everything to you,

440
00:23:29,813 --> 00:23:31,903
but what happened between Mr. Gong
and her was just a misunderstanding.

441
00:23:32,484 --> 00:23:34,814
And this is about my privacy,

442
00:23:35,553 --> 00:23:36,774
so please let me take care of it.

443
00:23:37,353 --> 00:23:40,244
Sure. I understand.

444
00:23:41,524 --> 00:23:44,363
It's just that
your mom seemed concerned,

445
00:23:44,363 --> 00:23:45,853
so I was worried too.

446
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:47,453
Please don't worry about it.

447
00:23:48,133 --> 00:23:50,194
Okay. I'll leave you to your work.

448
00:23:50,194 --> 00:23:51,264
All right.

449
00:24:07,984 --> 00:24:10,053
Why were you two going at it?

450
00:24:10,053 --> 00:24:14,084
Were you throwing punches
over that tenant of ours?

451
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:16,323
Unbelievable.

452
00:24:16,323 --> 00:24:19,764
Why on earth
are you fighting over...

453
00:24:19,764 --> 00:24:21,423
that country bumpkin?
I can't believe you.

454
00:24:22,133 --> 00:24:23,254
Oh, right.

455
00:24:24,033 --> 00:24:25,663
Why didn't I think of that sooner?

456
00:24:27,164 --> 00:24:29,693
"That tenant of ours?" That means...

457
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:32,843
Hey. It's the tenant lady.

458
00:24:32,843 --> 00:24:35,504
Come here
and have some fried chicken.

459
00:24:35,813 --> 00:24:37,034
Hello.

460
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:41,484
That lady seemed nice.

461
00:24:41,484 --> 00:24:43,853
But was she two-timing
my brother and my uncle?

462
00:24:43,853 --> 00:24:45,443
Is that why they were fighting?

463
00:24:49,524 --> 00:24:51,453
She's unbelievable.

464
00:24:54,863 --> 00:24:56,153
Who is this?

465
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:01,564
Goodness.

466
00:25:08,244 --> 00:25:09,703
We need to talk.

467
00:25:10,944 --> 00:25:12,990
You're Ms. Ma Ri, right?

468
00:25:13,014 --> 00:25:15,014
You brought the chicken
the other day.

469
00:25:15,553 --> 00:25:17,683
What brings you here?

470
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:21,793
Were you two-timing
Pil Seung and my uncle,

471
00:25:21,793 --> 00:25:23,424
or did you move
from one man to the next?

472
00:25:23,424 --> 00:25:25,754
If it's the latter,
who did you date first?

473
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:28,593
What on earth are you talking about?

474
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:31,224
Two-timing?
Move from one man to another?

475
00:25:32,863 --> 00:25:34,674
Ms. Ma Ri, I take it...

476
00:25:34,674 --> 00:25:36,994
that you've misunderstood
the situation.

477
00:25:37,404 --> 00:25:38,633
Anyway, here goes.

478
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:41,633
I didn't two-time anyone
or move from one man to the next.

479
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:45,703
Director Ko
is the only person I like.

480
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:49,083
How have you been
conducting yourself...

481
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:50,314
that has both guys
fighting over you?

482
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:52,484
I don't want you to date
any one of them.

483
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,453
You're the kind of person
that I hate.

484
00:25:56,823 --> 00:25:58,924
Anyway, from now on,

485
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:01,593
don't date either Pil Seung...

486
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:03,593
or my uncle. Got it?

487
00:26:03,593 --> 00:26:05,133
If I see you
with either one of them,

488
00:26:05,133 --> 00:26:06,724
- I'll pluck all your hair out.
- What...

489
00:26:07,434 --> 00:26:08,534
Gong Ma Ri!

490
00:26:12,744 --> 00:26:14,034
Ji Young, here you go.

491
00:26:14,474 --> 00:26:15,633
Sure.

492
00:26:17,143 --> 00:26:20,203
Ma Ri, you and I need to talk.

493
00:26:29,194 --> 00:26:31,484
Pil Seung, is that true?

494
00:26:32,293 --> 00:26:33,584
Yes, it is.

495
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,153
Why? Don't you believe me?

496
00:26:38,404 --> 00:26:40,593
I believe every word you say.

497
00:26:40,934 --> 00:26:43,334
Thanks for believing me.

498
00:26:44,133 --> 00:26:46,534
I thought she was a two-timer,

499
00:26:46,744 --> 00:26:48,420
and that's bad.

500
00:26:48,444 --> 00:26:50,643
What's bad should be pointed out...

501
00:26:50,643 --> 00:26:52,474
since it means
she was deceiving you.

502
00:26:55,154 --> 00:26:57,623
I won't let you date
a nasty woman...

503
00:26:57,623 --> 00:27:00,044
who dates more than one man at once.

504
00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:02,254
That's the only reason.

505
00:27:02,823 --> 00:27:05,369
But now that you say
that isn't the case,

506
00:27:05,393 --> 00:27:09,453
I will support
your relationship with her.

507
00:27:09,664 --> 00:27:10,734
Do you mean that?

508
00:27:10,734 --> 00:27:13,964
Of course. I want you to be happy.

509
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:19,703
Gosh, I'm grateful.

510
00:27:20,543 --> 00:27:23,673
Ma Ri, you're really like my sister.

511
00:27:25,883 --> 00:27:29,514
Pil Seung, thank you so much.

512
00:27:30,454 --> 00:27:32,784
Thanks for saying
I'm like your sister.

513
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:47,623
Ji Young, why did you
call me out here?

514
00:27:48,674 --> 00:27:49,794
No reason.

515
00:27:50,504 --> 00:27:52,564
I had something to say to you,

516
00:27:52,974 --> 00:27:54,703
and the air was cool.

517
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:59,143
I wanted to hold your hand
and go on a walk.

518
00:28:00,714 --> 00:28:02,373
Gosh, I'm relieved.

519
00:28:03,053 --> 00:28:06,014
I was worried that you were
going to give me an earful.

520
00:28:17,063 --> 00:28:18,193
Director Ko,

521
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:20,824
thank you for earlier.

522
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:24,734
I saw you and Ma Ri talk
in the front yard.

523
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,004
Gosh. Did you?

524
00:28:29,143 --> 00:28:30,974
Ma Ri seemed to have the wrong idea.

525
00:28:31,313 --> 00:28:33,203
We cleared
the misunderstanding though,

526
00:28:33,343 --> 00:28:34,744
and she agreed to support us.

527
00:28:37,214 --> 00:28:39,623
I said I trusted you,

528
00:28:39,623 --> 00:28:42,113
but I must've been secretly worried.

529
00:28:43,093 --> 00:28:45,524
Seeing her
made me reflect on my actions.

530
00:28:46,563 --> 00:28:49,853
She trusts you blindly
without a single doubt.

531
00:28:51,633 --> 00:28:54,834
From now on,
I'm going to put my faith in you...

532
00:28:56,004 --> 00:28:57,534
and be patient.

533
00:29:00,204 --> 00:29:01,304
Do you mean that?

534
00:29:02,543 --> 00:29:03,673
Yes.

535
00:29:06,383 --> 00:29:08,714
Your parents and your grandmother.

536
00:29:09,754 --> 00:29:12,584
I'm sure that in all due time,

537
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:14,883
they will understand
how I feel about you.

538
00:29:15,924 --> 00:29:17,584
No matter how long it takes,

539
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:21,524
I'll believe in you and be patient.

540
00:29:31,004 --> 00:29:32,133
Thanks.

541
00:29:33,543 --> 00:29:34,903
And I'll do better.

542
00:29:36,643 --> 00:29:37,734
I'm happy...

543
00:29:38,613 --> 00:29:40,574
to have you...

544
00:29:41,714 --> 00:29:42,814
by my side.

545
00:29:46,724 --> 00:29:47,883
I feel the same way.

546
00:29:57,133 --> 00:29:58,663
Do Do, head...

547
00:29:58,833 --> 00:30:01,333
to the audition waiting room.

548
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:02,893
Got it, Ms. Baek.

549
00:30:17,313 --> 00:30:18,383
Come in.

550
00:30:19,123 --> 00:30:20,784
Director Ko.

551
00:30:21,424 --> 00:30:23,323
Congratulations on joining...

552
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:25,123
GOGO Entertainment.

553
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:27,484
This is to congratulate you.

554
00:30:29,563 --> 00:30:30,923
Sure. Thanks.

555
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:32,893
Anyway, what brings you by?

556
00:30:32,934 --> 00:30:36,064
Do Do's here for the audition,
so I thought I'd swing by.

557
00:30:36,774 --> 00:30:39,834
Director Ko,
I'm terribly sorry about last time.

558
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:41,944
I had the wrong idea about you...

559
00:30:41,944 --> 00:30:43,490
and thought...

560
00:30:43,514 --> 00:30:45,684
that you didn't cast Do Do
in "Don't Lie"...

561
00:30:45,684 --> 00:30:48,044
because you held a grudge
against me.

562
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:50,154
That's why I acted out of line.

563
00:30:50,154 --> 00:30:52,684
Please know
that I went to your elders...

564
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,784
and deeply apologized.

565
00:30:55,393 --> 00:30:56,653
Yes, so I heard.

566
00:30:58,964 --> 00:31:01,833
That being said,
I only opened a new agency...

567
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:04,393
because it was the only way...

568
00:31:04,393 --> 00:31:06,893
to make ends meet
after Do Ra's passing.

569
00:31:08,573 --> 00:31:12,220
Director Ko,
please give Do Do another chance.

570
00:31:12,244 --> 00:31:13,274
Help me out...

571
00:31:13,274 --> 00:31:15,804
for my late daughter's sake.

572
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:22,343
Everyone will get a fair shot
at today's audition.

573
00:31:23,184 --> 00:31:25,343
If Do Do is right for the part,

574
00:31:25,684 --> 00:31:27,143
I won't have a reason to reject her.

575
00:31:27,724 --> 00:31:29,054
Prepare her well.

576
00:31:29,623 --> 00:31:32,123
That stubborn peabrain.

577
00:31:32,293 --> 00:31:34,484
Goodness, I appreciate
the encouragement.

578
00:31:34,734 --> 00:31:38,004
Anyway, I'll head out
keeping that in mind.

579
00:31:38,004 --> 00:31:40,464
Thank you.
Please think fondly of her.

580
00:31:46,444 --> 00:31:49,203
(Open audition
for "The House of Roses")

581
00:31:52,684 --> 00:31:55,373
Ji Young, don't be nervous.

582
00:31:55,984 --> 00:31:57,943
Just watch your dialect.
Break a leg.

583
00:31:58,154 --> 00:32:00,214
Right. I practiced a lot.

584
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:06,054
Are you nervous?

585
00:32:06,694 --> 00:32:07,824
Don't be.

586
00:32:09,234 --> 00:32:10,893
I'll begin.

587
00:32:11,533 --> 00:32:12,533
Sure.

588
00:32:12,533 --> 00:32:16,294
(Audition for "The House of Roses")

589
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:25,974
Hey, why were you
at the vacation home?

590
00:32:27,014 --> 00:32:28,843
For what reason did you go there?

591
00:32:30,154 --> 00:32:31,654
I'm his fiancee,

592
00:32:31,654 --> 00:32:33,214
so why were you at a place
I've never been to?

593
00:32:33,724 --> 00:32:35,714
What were you scheming?

594
00:32:37,024 --> 00:32:38,623
I bet you went there on purpose.

595
00:32:39,194 --> 00:32:41,423
It was to seduce the chairman.

596
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,294
This is adultery.

597
00:32:48,204 --> 00:32:50,893
Should I plaster your face
on social media as one?

598
00:32:51,603 --> 00:32:53,103
How would you like
to live as an adulterer...

599
00:32:53,103 --> 00:32:54,464
from the age of 27?

600
00:32:55,313 --> 00:32:57,343
Would you like to be the reason
the chairman...

601
00:32:57,343 --> 00:32:58,843
is also known as one?

602
00:32:59,283 --> 00:33:01,244
Is that what you really want?

603
00:33:16,464 --> 00:33:17,893
Good job.

604
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:19,464
My gosh.

605
00:33:20,004 --> 00:33:21,863
She's incredible.

606
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:25,834
How can one
play a character that well?

607
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:30,433
Oh, no. I think she'll get the part.

608
00:33:30,944 --> 00:33:33,173
My poor Do Do.

609
00:33:33,944 --> 00:33:36,314
Do Do, wait!

610
00:33:36,984 --> 00:33:39,083
How could you botch your lines?

611
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:41,953
I told you to focus,
not forget your lines.

612
00:33:42,593 --> 00:33:44,683
I wanted to do well,

613
00:33:45,363 --> 00:33:47,824
but there's nothing I can do
about the mistake I made.

614
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:50,653
This is all your fault.

615
00:33:50,734 --> 00:33:52,664
You keep pushing me,

616
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:54,794
and now I'm too intimidated
when I need to perform.

617
00:33:55,004 --> 00:33:56,803
Who's calling the kettle black?

618
00:33:56,803 --> 00:33:59,004
You can't leave when I spent
so much money on you today.

619
00:33:59,004 --> 00:34:00,603
Hey, you...

620
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,933
She'll be the death of me, darn it.

621
00:34:04,113 --> 00:34:05,474
Are you kidding me?

622
00:34:33,873 --> 00:34:35,774
Aren't you Myung Dong's boyfriend?

623
00:34:36,913 --> 00:34:38,803
She looks like Do Ra for sure.

624
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,603
How can she be someone else?

625
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:43,614
Why do I keep seeing her as Do Ra?

626
00:34:44,953 --> 00:34:46,544
This is baffling.

627
00:34:47,853 --> 00:34:48,913
Gosh.

628
00:34:50,024 --> 00:34:51,453
I see you were home.

629
00:34:52,464 --> 00:34:53,864
Right. I just got in...

630
00:34:53,864 --> 00:34:55,433
and had some ramyeon.
I'm heading back out.

631
00:34:55,433 --> 00:34:57,553
Can you get me a glass of water?

632
00:34:57,694 --> 00:34:58,763
Sure.

633
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:02,493
Gosh.

634
00:35:05,774 --> 00:35:07,404
Here you go.

635
00:35:07,404 --> 00:35:09,203
Right, thanks.

636
00:35:12,384 --> 00:35:13,774
Mom.

637
00:35:14,484 --> 00:35:17,373
You said you knew the tenant
at Director Ko's house.

638
00:35:19,654 --> 00:35:22,553
That nuisance of a girl?
What about her?

639
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:24,254
You see...

640
00:35:26,723 --> 00:35:30,194
Every time I see her,

641
00:35:30,993 --> 00:35:32,993
I'm reminded of Do Ra.

642
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:36,694
Something about her
makes me feel like she's Do Ra.

643
00:35:37,373 --> 00:35:39,703
I can't believe you.

644
00:35:39,703 --> 00:35:41,304
Unbelievable.

645
00:35:41,304 --> 00:35:43,813
I know it doesn't make any sense,

646
00:35:43,813 --> 00:35:46,243
but I can't shake off the feeling.

647
00:35:46,743 --> 00:35:49,183
Mom, could Do Ra's spirit...

648
00:35:49,183 --> 00:35:51,353
have gone
to where that girl lives...

649
00:35:51,353 --> 00:35:53,444
because it couldn't move on?

650
00:35:54,024 --> 00:35:55,353
We used to live there,

651
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:56,453
and the girl lives there currently.

652
00:35:56,453 --> 00:35:57,614
Could that be why?

653
00:35:57,754 --> 00:35:59,964
Park Do Sik, you fool!

654
00:35:59,964 --> 00:36:01,424
I'm on the verge of losing my mind.

655
00:36:01,424 --> 00:36:04,364
I'm frustrated by how Do Do
didn't get a call back.

656
00:36:04,364 --> 00:36:07,234
So cut the nonsense
and get out of here.

657
00:36:07,234 --> 00:36:10,074
Or shut that mouth of yours.

658
00:36:10,074 --> 00:36:12,574
You and that nonsense.

659
00:36:12,574 --> 00:36:15,433
I could just... Darn it.

660
00:36:15,643 --> 00:36:18,603
My head's killing me. Unbelievable.

661
00:36:27,249 --> 00:36:29,910
Do Jun, the pasta's delicious.

662
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:32,709
- Really?
- Yes.

663
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:35,620
The risotto and soup you made
were tasty too.

664
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,720
You're an incredible cook.

665
00:36:38,289 --> 00:36:39,720
I can't say I'm not.

666
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:43,160
Can you teach me the recipe
so that I can cook it for Pil Seung?

667
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:45,930
Sure thing.
It's actually easy to make.

668
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,240
By the way, Do Jun,

669
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,339
when you were in Korea
while your university was on break,

670
00:36:55,339 --> 00:36:58,300
you said you had a mom,
a brother, and also a sister.

671
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:01,939
So why are you always here
even on your days off?

672
00:37:02,209 --> 00:37:03,479
Don't you miss your family?

673
00:37:06,249 --> 00:37:07,309
Well...

674
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:10,450
I don't want to see
my mom and my brother.

675
00:37:12,729 --> 00:37:14,050
But I do miss my sister.

676
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,090
Then go see her.

677
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,220
I can't.

678
00:37:18,729 --> 00:37:19,789
Why not?

679
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,629
My sister...

680
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,329
is no longer on this earth.

681
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:30,140
Gosh.

682
00:37:31,879 --> 00:37:34,209
Do Jun, I'm sorry.

683
00:37:34,209 --> 00:37:35,609
Oh, no. I...

684
00:37:35,609 --> 00:37:37,220
It's all right.

685
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:40,510
Actually, I believe
that my sister's alive somewhere.

686
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:42,820
That's why it doesn't make me sad.

687
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:57,399
What did you all think?

688
00:37:57,899 --> 00:38:01,329
I thought Kim Ji Young
was perfect for the role.

689
00:38:02,069 --> 00:38:03,609
To put it straight,

690
00:38:03,609 --> 00:38:06,110
I want her to play
the second female lead.

691
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:08,269
I loved her portrayal the most.

692
00:38:08,479 --> 00:38:09,939
There's something special about her.

693
00:38:10,379 --> 00:38:11,539
I also vote for Kim Ji Young.

694
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,289
Her acting was stellar,

695
00:38:13,289 --> 00:38:15,550
but I also loved
how great she looked on camera.

696
00:38:16,789 --> 00:38:17,849
Director Ko, what do you think?

697
00:38:18,689 --> 00:38:20,450
She was the best in my opinion too.

698
00:38:20,629 --> 00:38:22,930
Her lack of experience
could be worrisome,

699
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:24,990
but I don't think
it'll be a huge problem.

700
00:38:26,499 --> 00:38:29,959
Bong Soo and Na Bi
are playing the leads,

701
00:38:30,439 --> 00:38:33,010
so a rookie actor
can play the second female lead.

702
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,430
The show might seem fresher
that way.

703
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:38,240
Are you all saying
you want Ms. Kim for the role?

704
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,340
I object...

705
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:42,209
to casting Ms. Kim.

706
00:38:44,479 --> 00:38:47,379
I'm against casting a rookie actress
for a role...

707
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,479
in an important project.

708
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:51,419
Ms. Jang,

709
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,990
throughout my career,
I've been lucky...

710
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:55,959
with the cast of my shows.

711
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:57,220
I have a good feeling
about her as well.

712
00:38:58,229 --> 00:39:00,890
You should trust my hunch on this.

713
00:39:01,499 --> 00:39:04,229
Sure. I'm well aware
of the experience you have.

714
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:08,099
However, it's too risky
to hire a rookie actress.

715
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,910
Also, I can't agree
that what we saw today...

716
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,910
was enough of a reason
to cast her...

717
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:15,140
as the second female lead.

718
00:39:15,609 --> 00:39:18,439
Ms. Jang, when working
on "Don't Lie,"

719
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:21,050
Ms. Kim played
a small supporting role.

720
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:23,419
She wasn't in many scenes,

721
00:39:23,419 --> 00:39:24,919
but the viewers kept asking...

722
00:39:24,919 --> 00:39:26,890
who she was in the comments.

723
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:29,899
These days, the viewers
are better at telling...

724
00:39:29,899 --> 00:39:31,689
who the gifted actors are.

725
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:35,459
Ms. Kim has the gift.

726
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,499
Still...

727
00:39:37,499 --> 00:39:40,039
Also, the series
"The House of Roses"...

728
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:43,200
is a love affair
between a man and two women.

729
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,479
The character she'll be playing...

730
00:39:45,479 --> 00:39:48,080
dresses herself up
as an ugly and innocent woman...

731
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,180
who gets her revenge
by approaching the couple...

732
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,610
and stealing the man.

733
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:55,550
While hiding who she really is,
she must live a lie.

734
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:58,019
Just look at Ms. Kim's eyes.

735
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,450
You can see
she harbors great secrets.

736
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:05,359
That's why I want her in this role.

737
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,430
The eyes are everything
when it comes to actors.

738
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,910
Besides, her image...

739
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:16,099
is the complete opposite
of our lead, who is Na Bi.

740
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,599
She seems innocent on the outside,

741
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,370
but she harbors
a burning passion inside her.

742
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:24,019
A villain who hides who she is...

743
00:40:24,019 --> 00:40:25,840
as she plots to get the man.

744
00:40:26,689 --> 00:40:28,280
Ji Young is perfect for the role.

745
00:40:28,589 --> 00:40:29,649
I believe...

746
00:40:29,959 --> 00:40:32,820
Ji Young will do a stellar job.

747
00:40:35,229 --> 00:40:37,459
Let's think about it
for a few days and...

748
00:40:37,459 --> 00:40:38,590
Ms. Jang.

749
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,669
I'm leaving for Paris
in two days with Director Ko...

750
00:40:41,669 --> 00:40:43,439
to accept the Juniper Award...

751
00:40:43,439 --> 00:40:44,700
and don't have the time.

752
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,439
If you were going to drag this out,

753
00:40:46,439 --> 00:40:48,229
why did you bother
holding the audition today?

754
00:40:49,539 --> 00:40:50,939
Let's decide right now.

755
00:40:57,019 --> 00:40:58,809
We'll take a short break, then.

756
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:01,950
Director Ko, we need to talk.

757
00:41:13,169 --> 00:41:15,559
Director Ko, this is wrong.

758
00:41:16,539 --> 00:41:17,599
Sorry?

759
00:41:17,999 --> 00:41:19,740
I know who Kim Ji Young is.

760
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,829
She's the tenant
who lives at your house.

761
00:41:22,339 --> 00:41:24,499
She's the reason behind
your scuffle with Mr. Gong.

762
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,410
I don't want a troublesome woman
starring in our project.

763
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:30,140
She could create problems for us.

764
00:41:31,249 --> 00:41:34,410
Ms. Jang, I already told you
it was a misunderstanding.

765
00:41:35,249 --> 00:41:36,680
Besides, this is a business.

766
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:40,149
We're here to decide the best actor
to play the role.

767
00:41:40,589 --> 00:41:42,390
That's why I'm saying this.

768
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,160
You may say
this is strictly business,

769
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,959
but personal feelings
can get involved.

770
00:41:49,129 --> 00:41:52,200
I don't want to take such a risk
when this is our first project.

771
00:41:52,769 --> 00:41:55,570
I don't understand why the writer
is head over heels for her,

772
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:58,109
but I'd like you to persuade her...

773
00:41:58,109 --> 00:42:00,309
to cast someone else.

774
00:42:01,479 --> 00:42:02,539
Ms. Jang,

775
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,220
you seem to be the one...

776
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,349
who's letting your personal feelings
sway you.

777
00:42:07,649 --> 00:42:10,160
If I hadn't stayed professional,

778
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,950
I wouldn't have held
an open audition today.

779
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,629
Was there an actress
who did better than her...

780
00:42:15,629 --> 00:42:17,360
or who was better for the role?

781
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:19,789
She was the best and that's a fact.

782
00:42:20,169 --> 00:42:22,330
Not casting her
for personal reasons...

783
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:23,800
seems unfair to me.

784
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:28,810
Ji Young was here
not as my girlfriend...

785
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:30,870
but as an actress auditioning.

786
00:42:31,709 --> 00:42:32,840
Also,

787
00:42:34,109 --> 00:42:36,140
I can't persuade Writer Kim.

788
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,640
Once she has an idea,
she has to see it through.

789
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,689
She's the one
who created this character,

790
00:42:41,689 --> 00:42:45,149
so who could know better
as to which actor to cast?

791
00:42:46,959 --> 00:42:50,559
Ms. Jang, please trust
our judgment on this.

792
00:42:51,729 --> 00:42:52,860
Also,

793
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:55,890
you said you'd trust my decisions.

794
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:11,379
Gosh. You worked so hard
preparing for this audition.

795
00:43:11,819 --> 00:43:14,309
I'm sorry that kalguksu
is all I can treat you to.

796
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:18,149
When Popcorn Entertainment
solidifies itself as a good agency,

797
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:21,550
I'll buy you a steak
at a fancy restaurant.

798
00:43:21,859 --> 00:43:25,090
Mr. Lee, why would you say that?

799
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:27,559
I love kalguksu.

800
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,100
Besides, on a day like this,

801
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,530
a hot bowl of kalguksu
warms you up inside.

802
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:40,840
This is Popcorn Entertainment.

803
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:45,910
What was that? Really?

804
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:51,149
Thank you so much. Sure.

805
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:55,390
What did they say?

806
00:43:55,589 --> 00:43:58,289
Ji Young, we did it.

807
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,600
You did it!

808
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,689
What?

809
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:04,640
Are you serious?

810
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,700
Yes.

811
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:07,910
Tell me this isn't a dream.

812
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:10,370
It isn't. You got the part.

813
00:44:15,649 --> 00:44:16,780
What?

814
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,319
Our tenant...

815
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:20,879
passed the audition
and got a role in Pil Seung's drama?

816
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:24,019
Yes. She just signed a contract.

817
00:44:24,189 --> 00:44:25,289
Soo Yeon!

818
00:44:25,289 --> 00:44:27,789
How could you let that happen?
You should've put a stop to it.

819
00:44:27,789 --> 00:44:29,860
You should've said no.

820
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:34,160
I can't stand
that they see each other at home.

821
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,315
Knowing they'll work together too...

822
00:44:36,339 --> 00:44:37,829
I really hate that.

823
00:44:37,939 --> 00:44:39,700
I hate that so much.

824
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:41,899
I objected, Sun Young.

825
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:44,899
And I talked to Pil Seung too.

826
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:48,470
I objected to her
auditioning for the role as well.

827
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:51,649
But everyone else liked her.
It was a unanimous vote,

828
00:44:51,649 --> 00:44:53,910
and the writer insisted too,
so I was left with no choice.

829
00:44:54,789 --> 00:44:56,419
The project won't happen...

830
00:44:56,419 --> 00:44:58,149
if the writer pulls out, you see.

831
00:44:58,419 --> 00:45:00,820
What should we do about this, then?

832
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:03,160
Sun Young.

833
00:45:03,629 --> 00:45:06,870
Could you ask her
to drop the project?

834
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,829
Say you can help so she won't
have to pay the penalty.

835
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:13,169
Right now, the only option
is to get her to back out herself.

836
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:16,700
Okay. I got it.

837
00:45:17,479 --> 00:45:21,470
Hey. Are you saying
that country bumpkin...

838
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,039
decided to be in Pil Seung's drama?

839
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:27,680
Oh, my goodness. What's going on?

840
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:31,180
Things are getting worse and worse.

841
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:36,149
Who is it?

842
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,999
- Hi, how are you?
- Don't ask.

843
00:45:44,339 --> 00:45:46,129
Do you have no conscience?

844
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:49,939
How dare you audition
to be in Pil Seung's drama?

845
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:54,209
Do you think we approve of you
because we haven't said anything?

846
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,870
Mother, keep quiet.

847
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:57,740
Ji Young.

848
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:00,079
Can you drop the drama?

849
00:46:01,649 --> 00:46:03,620
I'm friends
with the production company CEO.

850
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:06,959
I'll call her so you don't have to
pay for breach of contract.

851
00:46:06,959 --> 00:46:08,550
I want you to back out.

852
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:13,530
But I got the role
through a fair audition.

853
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:14,689
Ji Young!

854
00:46:14,999 --> 00:46:16,800
You said you liked Pil Seung!

855
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,360
Then you shouldn't do this!

856
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,530
Our Pil Seung
is just getting started.

857
00:46:21,669 --> 00:46:23,580
If word gets out that you're dating,

858
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,709
people are bound to gossip...

859
00:46:25,709 --> 00:46:27,180
he gave his girlfriend a part.

860
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:29,340
How would that make him look?

861
00:46:29,649 --> 00:46:32,079
Don't you even think?

862
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,450
Back out right away!

863
00:46:33,589 --> 00:46:35,950
Why are you being so long-winded?

864
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:39,089
Ji Young.
If you want to work that badly,

865
00:46:39,089 --> 00:46:40,830
break up with Pil Seung first.

866
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:43,220
Don't get in his way.

867
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:47,360
She should break up with me
to do what?

868
00:46:48,129 --> 00:46:50,430
Who are you saying
is getting in whose way?

869
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,329
Grandma. What are you talking about?

870
00:46:54,569 --> 00:46:56,640
You moron.

871
00:46:57,109 --> 00:46:59,926
You left the TV station
to be successful.

872
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:02,340
How could you serve up
your girlfriend a role?

873
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,280
I didn't give her the role.

874
00:47:05,819 --> 00:47:07,289
There was an impartial audition...

875
00:47:07,289 --> 00:47:08,950
and the vote was unanimous.

876
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,089
Ji Young might be my girlfriend,

877
00:47:12,089 --> 00:47:13,550
but first and foremost,
she's an actor.

878
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:16,689
You're calling her an actor?

879
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:19,689
You need to separate work and life.

880
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:22,789
If you give people roles
because you want to be around them,

881
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:24,899
something bad is bound to happen.

882
00:47:25,669 --> 00:47:27,930
Why can't you
separate work and life?

883
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,300
That's not how I do things.

884
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:34,510
Ji Young got the role today,

885
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:36,370
but my emotions
played no part in it.

886
00:47:37,319 --> 00:47:40,680
Stop it. Please don't fight
because of me.

887
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:46,820
My gosh. How dare you cry?

888
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:49,236
Are you crying
because Pil Seung's here now?

889
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:51,930
Because you want him
to feel sorry for you?

890
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:52,930
Grandma!

891
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:55,569
I'm sorry.
I apologize for everything.

892
00:47:55,569 --> 00:47:56,660
What?

893
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:58,660
- You...
- Don't, Mother.

894
00:47:58,769 --> 00:47:59,899
Stop it.

895
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:01,870
I'm sorry.

896
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:09,979
I'm sorry, Ji Young.

897
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,640
You got in trouble because of me.

898
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:16,680
No. I should apologize to you.

899
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,280
I didn't think it through.

900
00:48:19,859 --> 00:48:22,320
I shouldn't have auditioned.

901
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:25,189
The likes of me
shouldn't even dream of acting.

902
00:48:26,459 --> 00:48:27,990
Why would you say that?

903
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:31,300
Over 20 people
auditioned for your role.

904
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:33,999
You beat them all to come first.

905
00:48:34,839 --> 00:48:38,340
Do you know
how much the judges praised you?

906
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,740
Have confidence.

907
00:48:42,379 --> 00:48:44,709
I said you wouldn't have to
hear stuff like that again.

908
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:47,809
I'm sorry you had to again.

909
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:50,919
I'll do whatever it takes...

910
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:53,349
to persuade my parents and grandma.

911
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,320
You just think about your acting.

912
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:58,890
You said you trusted me.

913
00:49:02,629 --> 00:49:04,629
I trust you, Director.

914
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:16,539
Baby chick.

915
00:49:17,919 --> 00:49:19,010
What?

916
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:22,950
Do you think
it's the right time for that?

917
00:49:26,189 --> 00:49:27,289
Baby chick.

918
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,360
Chirp.

919
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:37,599
I'm nervous to go on a business trip
and leave you behind.

920
00:49:38,339 --> 00:49:39,530
Maybe I shouldn't go.

921
00:49:40,209 --> 00:49:41,729
Stop it.

922
00:49:42,039 --> 00:49:44,209
Your family dislikes me...

923
00:49:44,209 --> 00:49:46,640
because you're so immature.

924
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:48,539
I was kidding.

925
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:52,910
I'm worried something
will happen to you while I'm gone.

926
00:49:53,649 --> 00:49:54,979
I'm not a child.

927
00:49:55,689 --> 00:49:59,680
I'll be my cheerful self
and do fine without you.

928
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:02,249
Don't worry about me
and have a safe trip.

929
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:04,260
I'd love to...

930
00:50:04,399 --> 00:50:07,490
see you receive a huge award.

931
00:50:07,899 --> 00:50:09,090
It's so cool.

932
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:14,070
Okay. I promise to win an award.

933
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:17,939
Don't you have
an early shoot tomorrow?

934
00:50:18,379 --> 00:50:21,410
I do. I have to leave
after just three hours of sleep.

935
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:27,280
You have to leave early
to catch your morning flight.

936
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:30,550
You'll leave before me.

937
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:33,249
See you afterward.

938
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:36,390
Let's go home.

939
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,519
For tomorrow.

940
00:50:52,879 --> 00:50:56,570
Mom. Why are you up?
I said I'd see myself out.

941
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:00,879
I couldn't allow that.
I should see you off.

942
00:51:02,519 --> 00:51:04,180
You're the best.

943
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:08,019
Good luck.

944
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:10,019
Thanks.

945
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:16,530
Mom.

946
00:51:18,069 --> 00:51:19,530
Please don't say...

947
00:51:20,109 --> 00:51:23,129
anything weird to Ji Young
while I'm away.

948
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,370
Please.

949
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:26,950
Concentrate on your trip...

950
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:29,010
and forget about women.

951
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:32,539
It's an honor for you
and you should celebrate.

952
00:51:35,589 --> 00:51:37,349
Okay. See you.

953
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:41,320
Have a safe trip.

954
00:51:56,069 --> 00:51:58,599
Who films at 4 a.m.?

955
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:00,370
You didn't sleep a wink, did you?

956
00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:03,640
I'm just fine. I don't mind at all.

957
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,610
- I'll go and say hi.
- Okay.

958
00:52:08,089 --> 00:52:09,410
Hello.

959
00:52:10,589 --> 00:52:11,879
Hello.

960
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:15,335
Hello, Director.

961
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:17,689
- Oh, hello, Ji Young.
- Hi.

962
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:23,059
What's this?

963
00:52:24,269 --> 00:52:25,760
Jin Dan didn't come home last night?

964
00:52:27,339 --> 00:52:29,070
I pleaded with him...

965
00:52:29,269 --> 00:52:31,370
and he slept out yet again?

966
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:36,769
He has to be with her right now.

967
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:37,979
That country bumpkin.

968
00:52:38,819 --> 00:52:40,209
She'll pay for it.

969
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:47,149
Hey, you! Open the door!

970
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:49,129
Open up this instant!

971
00:52:49,129 --> 00:52:50,260
Darn you!

972
00:52:51,129 --> 00:52:54,289
Gosh, I knew it.
She's not home either.

973
00:52:54,970 --> 00:52:57,899
I had my doubts and I was right.
They're together somewhere.

974
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,360
Goodness.

975
00:52:59,439 --> 00:53:01,470
What should I do to her?

976
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:04,609
- Open up.
- Ae Kyo. What are you doing?

977
00:53:04,609 --> 00:53:06,479
You'll wake the neighborhood.

978
00:53:06,479 --> 00:53:10,240
Sun Young. My Jin Dan
didn't come home last night.

979
00:53:10,479 --> 00:53:12,580
I rushed over as soon as
the sun rose...

980
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:14,519
because I thought
he'd be with this brat.

981
00:53:14,519 --> 00:53:16,565
She's not home either.

982
00:53:16,589 --> 00:53:18,579
I swear they're together.

983
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:19,890
What?

984
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:22,320
Sun Young.
You saw Tae Hee too, didn't you?

985
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:24,890
Jin Dan's fiancée.

986
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:27,390
Didn't she look
intellectual and well-kept?

987
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:30,229
But this darn witch
got her teeth into him.

988
00:53:30,399 --> 00:53:33,229
Because this vixen got to him,

989
00:53:33,769 --> 00:53:35,829
the engagement might be called off.

990
00:53:36,569 --> 00:53:39,300
It could be called off?
Are you serious?

991
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,110
I need to teach her a lesson.

992
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,410
I'll kill her and me both.

993
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,240
Hey.

994
00:53:47,149 --> 00:53:49,149
She just got back.

995
00:53:49,289 --> 00:53:50,680
Ji Young.

996
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:52,849
Did you sleep out last night?

997
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:54,990
Who were you with?

998
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:56,959
Who were you with?

999
00:53:56,959 --> 00:53:59,590
No, Ae Kyo. Talk it out.

1000
00:53:59,830 --> 00:54:02,660
Why are you all out here
this early in the morning?

1001
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:05,099
You're asking why? You darn witch.

1002
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,510
You were with Jin Dan all night,
weren't you?

1003
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:10,510
- What?
- His engagement might fall through,

1004
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:12,840
and you dare ask why we're here?

1005
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:14,680
- My gosh.
- Darn you!

1006
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,310
Get off me!

1007
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:17,439
Seriously...

1008
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,579
Excuse me, ma'am.

1009
00:54:20,019 --> 00:54:23,089
I told you there was nothing
going on between me and Mr. Gong.

1010
00:54:23,089 --> 00:54:24,950
But why are you
being like this again?

1011
00:54:25,319 --> 00:54:27,990
I just got home
after working all night.

1012
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:31,160
What did I do
to make you do this to me?

1013
00:54:31,229 --> 00:54:32,700
Working all night, my foot.

1014
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:35,530
Hey! I'm warning you again.

1015
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:37,999
You better not
sneak around my son ever again.

1016
00:54:37,999 --> 00:54:40,300
If you do, I'll kill you.
Do you understand?

1017
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:43,939
Sun Young,
kick her out this instant.

1018
00:54:50,819 --> 00:54:52,550
Listen.

1019
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:55,019
If what your friend says is true,

1020
00:54:55,019 --> 00:54:58,519
we will have to do something
about it.

1021
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:03,660
I'm afraid someone
in the neighborhood will find out.

1022
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,660
This just doesn't feel right.

1023
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,530
Mom, Ji Young said
she was working all night.

1024
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:10,959
- And she said it wasn't true.
- What?

1025
00:55:11,269 --> 00:55:14,700
I also think
it was Ae Kyo's misunderstanding.

1026
00:55:15,109 --> 00:55:17,999
Ji Young is dating Pil Seung.

1027
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:20,709
She wouldn't do such a thing.

1028
00:55:20,709 --> 00:55:23,950
Come on. It doesn't matter
if it's true or not.

1029
00:55:23,950 --> 00:55:26,740
I just don't want our family
to get mixed up in this.

1030
00:55:27,789 --> 00:55:28,849
Sun Young.

1031
00:55:29,649 --> 00:55:32,780
We have to kick Ji Young out...

1032
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:36,120
before Pil Seung comes back.

1033
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:38,890
What?

1034
00:55:41,499 --> 00:55:42,559
Listen.

1035
00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:45,399
I didn't like you
in the first place.

1036
00:55:46,169 --> 00:55:49,200
But parents have a soft spot
for their children.

1037
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:52,840
I didn't want to do anything
since Pil Seung liked you a lot.

1038
00:55:54,479 --> 00:55:57,979
That's why I was going to sit back
and watch how things would go.

1039
00:55:59,379 --> 00:56:02,209
I thought I would probably end up
liking you too.

1040
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:05,019
But this isn't just right.

1041
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:09,890
How could you drag Pil Seung
into a mess like this?

1042
00:56:11,459 --> 00:56:13,320
Ms. Kim, that's not true.

1043
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:15,890
I swear I'm innocent.

1044
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:17,800
Ji Young.

1045
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,200
I don't believe
everything Mr. Gong's mom said.

1046
00:56:20,839 --> 00:56:23,329
But she is actually my friend.

1047
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:25,769
And Mr. Gong's sister-in-law...

1048
00:56:26,810 --> 00:56:30,280
I mean, Soo Yeon,
the CEO of Pil Seung's company,

1049
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:31,910
is also my friend.

1050
00:56:32,979 --> 00:56:34,689
While you're dating my son,

1051
00:56:34,689 --> 00:56:36,479
you keep getting involved
with Mr. Gong.

1052
00:56:37,919 --> 00:56:40,789
I don't even want to think about it.

1053
00:56:40,789 --> 00:56:42,320
I find it really upsetting.

1054
00:56:43,899 --> 00:56:46,499
You keep saying you're innocent,

1055
00:56:46,499 --> 00:56:48,899
but they say it takes two to tango.

1056
00:56:48,899 --> 00:56:50,729
Why does it keep happening
when it's not true?

1057
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,669
I'm sure it's happening...

1058
00:56:53,669 --> 00:56:56,970
because you did something
to cause all the trouble.

1059
00:56:58,109 --> 00:57:01,209
I know Pil Seung likes you,

1060
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:02,680
but you're not supposed to do this.

1061
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:06,340
All our family
didn't think of you that way,

1062
00:57:06,749 --> 00:57:09,910
but you're just being shameless.

1063
00:57:13,789 --> 00:57:14,950
Ji Young.

1064
00:57:15,959 --> 00:57:19,519
If you really like Pil Seung
and care about him,

1065
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:22,729
I think this is where
you should back off.

1066
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:25,599
Of course.
And you should move out too.

1067
00:57:25,899 --> 00:57:27,229
That's the right thing to do.

1068
00:57:27,769 --> 00:57:29,870
And don't even try...

1069
00:57:29,870 --> 00:57:32,910
to put this on the Internet
or something...

1070
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:35,180
saying
Director Ko Pil Seung's family...

1071
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:37,640
forced you to move out.

1072
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:40,919
I don't want to think of you...

1073
00:57:40,919 --> 00:57:44,550
as such an ignorant
and ungrateful tenant. Okay?

1074
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,649
So you should hurry
and find a new place to live.

1075
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:49,649
We will pay for the moving expenses.

1076
00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:55,090
Yes, Ms. So.

1077
00:57:56,729 --> 00:57:59,399
Ms. Kim, I'll move out.

1078
00:58:00,569 --> 00:58:02,800
I'll move out as you say.

1079
00:58:03,470 --> 00:58:05,200
Please don't worry about it.

1080
00:58:19,459 --> 00:58:20,590
Hello.

1081
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:23,320
I'm looking for a room to rent.

1082
00:58:29,229 --> 00:58:32,370
Do Do keeps getting rejected...

1083
00:58:32,370 --> 00:58:34,329
from all the auditions.

1084
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:42,970
Why is life so tough?

1085
00:58:45,319 --> 00:58:48,720
I already spent
nearly all the money...

1086
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,990
I got from CEO Gong.

1087
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:53,649
What do I do?

1088
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:03,189
I just can't work
with you anymore, Ms. Baek.

1089
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:06,160
I'll keep the deposit
as the pay for the work I've done.

1090
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:08,339
If you want to ask for a penalty,

1091
00:59:08,339 --> 00:59:11,039
you should talk to my dad
who is a lawyer.

1092
00:59:12,039 --> 00:59:16,070
My gosh. Do Do,
that ungrateful brat!

1093
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:22,149
Fine. You should leave me.

1094
00:59:22,149 --> 00:59:25,780
I don't want an actress like you.

1095
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:28,919
What do I do now?

1096
00:59:29,890 --> 00:59:31,559
What am I supposed to do?

1097
00:59:32,629 --> 00:59:34,629
Has she lost her mind?

1098
00:59:35,669 --> 00:59:36,829
You want money?

1099
00:59:37,439 --> 00:59:38,629
Another 50,000 dollars?

1100
00:59:40,839 --> 00:59:42,269
I can't believe this.

1101
00:59:43,470 --> 00:59:45,539
How could you be so shameless?

1102
00:59:45,539 --> 00:59:47,070
Listen, Mr. Gong.

1103
00:59:47,249 --> 00:59:51,280
I'm not just asking for money.
I want to borrow it.

1104
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:54,720
I understand I have
no right to ask you for this,

1105
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,519
but the 50,000 dollars
you got me last time...

1106
00:59:56,519 --> 00:59:58,660
isn't enough
to foster a new actress.

1107
00:59:58,660 --> 00:59:59,959
Since I don't have enough money,

1108
00:59:59,959 --> 01:00:02,120
I'm just suffering
with no significant results.

1109
01:00:02,729 --> 01:00:05,100
I swear I'll pay you back.

1110
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:06,729
I'll pay you back with interest.

1111
01:00:06,729 --> 01:00:08,629
We promised
not to see each other again.

1112
01:00:09,229 --> 01:00:11,360
You should keep your promise.

1113
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:13,600
Get out.
I can't stand the sight of you.

1114
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:16,300
Mr. Gong. Just do me this one favor.

1115
01:00:16,769 --> 01:00:20,809
My Do Ra will be really grateful
to you up there.

1116
01:00:21,149 --> 01:00:22,340
Ms. Baek!

1117
01:00:23,310 --> 01:00:25,840
Stop taking advantage
of your dead daughter.

1118
01:00:26,379 --> 01:00:28,065
She died a long time ago.

1119
01:00:28,089 --> 01:00:29,510
Mr. Gong.

1120
01:00:29,890 --> 01:00:31,660
If things worked out for you,

1121
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:34,320
you could've been my son-in-law.

1122
01:00:34,689 --> 01:00:38,289
How could you be so harsh on me?

1123
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:41,530
Mr. Cho, take this crazy lady
outside this instant.

1124
01:00:42,569 --> 01:00:43,729
- Now!
- Yes, sir.

1125
01:00:43,729 --> 01:00:45,740
Mr. Gong. Listen to me.

1126
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:47,100
Get off me. I'll get myself out!

1127
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:48,439
Please... My gosh.

1128
01:00:48,439 --> 01:00:51,156
- Please get out.
- Get off me! Let go!

1129
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:52,680
Darn it!

1130
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:55,340
Let go of me! Hey!

1131
01:01:05,459 --> 01:01:08,919
Oh, dear. You were born
under an unlucky star.

1132
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:15,090
You have led such a turbulent life.

1133
01:01:15,399 --> 01:01:18,129
My gosh. How did you know that?

1134
01:01:18,999 --> 01:01:20,439
Do you think...

1135
01:01:20,439 --> 01:01:22,829
I'll be able
to get back on my feet again?

1136
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:24,810
Only two years ago,

1137
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:26,640
I had my own building in Gangnam.

1138
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,070
I was living a decent life.

1139
01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:31,950
But after my daughter died,

1140
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:33,809
I lost all my hopes.

1141
01:01:34,189 --> 01:01:36,819
One of my sons is
just working part-time,

1142
01:01:36,819 --> 01:01:40,479
and I don't even know
how the other is doing.

1143
01:01:40,589 --> 01:01:43,519
And nothing's working out
for my new business.

1144
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:46,359
Now I just feel like...

1145
01:01:46,359 --> 01:01:49,229
I want to follow
my daughter to death.

1146
01:01:50,430 --> 01:01:53,160
What are you talking about?

1147
01:01:54,209 --> 01:01:56,970
You don't have a destiny
where you lose your child.

1148
01:01:57,339 --> 01:01:58,399
What?

1149
01:01:58,939 --> 01:02:01,249
My daughter died two years ago.

1150
01:02:01,249 --> 01:02:02,570
She's not dead.

1151
01:02:03,310 --> 01:02:06,809
Look here. She's living close by.
Why do you think she's dead?

1152
01:02:08,149 --> 01:02:11,079
What? She's living close by?

1153
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:15,649
What a fraud.

1154
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:18,499
If my daughter was alive,
she would've come to see me.

1155
01:02:18,499 --> 01:02:20,760
My 100 dollars
just went down the drain.

1156
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:24,300
That's right.
I have to hold on to Do Do.

1157
01:02:25,169 --> 01:02:27,229
She will come back
if she's cast in a drama series.

1158
01:02:28,039 --> 01:02:29,810
I will go to the executive director
and make a scene.

1159
01:02:29,810 --> 01:02:31,640
If Do Do is not cast,

1160
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:33,570
I will bite my tongue off and die
at the broadcasting station.

1161
01:02:34,249 --> 01:02:37,809
They can't be doing this to me.

1162
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:42,849
(KMS Broadcasting Center)

1163
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:05,740
Do Ra.

1164
01:03:06,510 --> 01:03:07,640
Do Ra!

1165
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,340
Do Ra.

1166
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:13,550
Do Ra!

1167
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:14,749
- Do Ra.
- My goodness.

1168
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:16,890
- Do Ra.
- You startled me.

1169
01:03:16,890 --> 01:03:18,249
Why are you doing this to me?

1170
01:03:19,089 --> 01:03:20,419
It was my daughter, Do Ra.

1171
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:22,950
I'm sure it was my Do Ra.

1172
01:03:24,459 --> 01:03:25,620
You stink of alcohol.

1173
01:03:25,959 --> 01:03:29,090
Ma'am, I think you're drunk.

1174
01:03:29,729 --> 01:03:31,860
Why did you drink so much
in the middle of the day?

1175
01:03:35,669 --> 01:03:37,209
Right. I guess I'm drunk.

1176
01:03:37,209 --> 01:03:39,499
How could I mistake
that hillbilly for Do Ra?

1177
01:03:41,709 --> 01:03:45,180
Every time I see her,

1178
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:47,709
I'm reminded of Do Ra.

1179
01:03:49,289 --> 01:03:51,459
Something about her
makes me feel like she's Do Ra.

1180
01:03:51,459 --> 01:03:53,919
What are you talking about?

1181
01:03:54,459 --> 01:03:57,430
You don't have a destiny
where you lose your child.

1182
01:03:57,430 --> 01:03:58,600
What?

1183
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:01,030
My daughter died two years ago.

1184
01:04:01,030 --> 01:04:02,530
She's not dead.

1185
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:06,729
Look here. She's living close by.
Why do you think she's dead?

1186
01:04:13,839 --> 01:04:15,169
Where did she go?

1187
01:04:34,669 --> 01:04:36,499
What on earth?

1188
01:04:36,499 --> 01:04:38,300
What's your problem?

1189
01:04:40,399 --> 01:04:41,530
Let me see!

1190
01:04:43,769 --> 01:04:45,740
What's your problem?

1191
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:47,939
What do you think you're doing?

1192
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:50,309
You're Do Ra.

1193
01:04:51,379 --> 01:04:52,579
You really...

1194
01:04:53,419 --> 01:04:54,879
are Do Ra.

1195
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:58,249
What?

1196
01:05:03,729 --> 01:05:06,590
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1197
01:05:38,795 --> 01:05:40,935
You were fighting over someone
who isn't on my level.

1198
01:05:40,935 --> 01:05:42,435
I don't ever want to see you again.

1199
01:05:42,435 --> 01:05:44,364
Why did you have to fall
for someone like her?

1200
01:05:44,364 --> 01:05:47,134
Is there a reason
you can't help yourself?

1201
01:05:47,134 --> 01:05:50,134
Ji Young looks like Do Ra.

1202
01:05:50,304 --> 01:05:52,145
How on earth can she be my Do Ra?

1203
01:05:52,145 --> 01:05:53,404
Just look at her.

1204
01:05:53,404 --> 01:05:55,745
That's right.
Do Ra was allergic to walnuts.

1205
01:05:55,745 --> 01:05:58,105
If the country bumpkin
is also allergic to walnuts...

1206
01:05:58,214 --> 01:06:00,015
Is there walnuts in this?

1207
01:06:00,015 --> 01:06:02,415
I'm sorry, but I have to hurry home.

1208
01:06:02,415 --> 01:06:03,915
Why can't I get
in touch with Ji Young?

1209
01:06:03,915 --> 01:06:05,554
Since yesterday,
she hasn't been answering my texts.

1210
01:06:05,554 --> 01:06:06,984
Could something have happened?

1211
01:06:07,025 --> 01:06:08,054
Why is it vacant?

1212
01:06:08,054 --> 01:06:09,685
Did she perhaps move out?

1213
01:06:10,324 --> 01:06:11,884
