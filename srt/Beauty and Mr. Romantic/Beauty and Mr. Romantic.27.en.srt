(Episode 27)

3
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:26,227
What on earth?

4
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:28,236
What's your problem?

5
00:00:30,157 --> 00:00:31,437
Let me see!

6
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:35,437
What's your problem?

7
00:00:35,437 --> 00:00:37,836
What do you think you're doing?

8
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:40,247
You're Do Ra.

9
00:00:41,176 --> 00:00:42,416
You really...

10
00:00:43,206 --> 00:00:44,787
are Do Ra.

11
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:48,086
What?

12
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:50,516
Of course.

13
00:00:51,147 --> 00:00:53,087
You always gave me this odd feeling.

14
00:00:53,087 --> 00:00:54,486
I thought I had gone crazy.

15
00:00:54,486 --> 00:00:57,456
But for some reason,
the feeling was uncanny.

16
00:00:58,657 --> 00:01:00,556
That was because you were Do Ra.

17
00:01:00,556 --> 00:01:02,797
Because you were my daughter Do Ra.

18
00:01:03,357 --> 00:01:05,203
What did you just say?

19
00:01:05,227 --> 00:01:08,077
Did you just say
I'm your daughter Park Do Ra?

20
00:01:08,596 --> 00:01:09,736
Goodness.

21
00:01:10,736 --> 00:01:14,512
Look here, lady.
Get your act together.

22
00:01:14,536 --> 00:01:15,807
I don't care how drunk you are.

23
00:01:15,807 --> 00:01:18,116
Who are you mistaking
your daughter for?

24
00:01:18,706 --> 00:01:19,986
No...

25
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:21,587
Do Ra, it's me.

26
00:01:22,747 --> 00:01:25,047
It's your mom.

27
00:01:25,047 --> 00:01:27,646
Do Ra, I'm your mom.

28
00:01:27,646 --> 00:01:29,187
I'm your mom.

29
00:01:29,187 --> 00:01:31,387
Do Ra, I'm your mom!

30
00:01:31,387 --> 00:01:34,366
Gosh. What is the matter with you?

31
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:35,956
If you're drunk,

32
00:01:35,956 --> 00:01:38,266
go home, wash your feet,
and sleep it off.

33
00:01:38,527 --> 00:01:40,807
This is no place for drunks.

34
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,407
Unbelievable.

35
00:01:44,066 --> 00:01:46,176
Do Ra!

36
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:47,706
Do Ra...

37
00:01:50,907 --> 00:01:54,217
She's my Do Ra. I know she is.

38
00:01:55,176 --> 00:01:56,316
But...

39
00:01:56,747 --> 00:02:00,057
she's actually Kim Ji Young,
that country bumpkin.

40
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,126
How is she my Do Ra?

41
00:02:02,786 --> 00:02:05,426
She can't be my Do Ra.

42
00:02:06,157 --> 00:02:07,997
What on earth is going on?

43
00:02:07,997 --> 00:02:10,357
What's happening?

44
00:02:10,357 --> 00:02:13,236
What is this situation?

45
00:02:14,396 --> 00:02:15,736
My gosh.

46
00:02:16,097 --> 00:02:18,976
That lady is out of her mind.

47
00:02:19,436 --> 00:02:21,476
Talk about the unexpected happening.

48
00:02:27,607 --> 00:02:29,977
Sorry. I mistook you
for someone else.

49
00:02:29,977 --> 00:02:31,176
You're Do Ra.

50
00:02:31,176 --> 00:02:32,487
You really...

51
00:02:33,216 --> 00:02:34,657
are Do Ra.

52
00:02:36,287 --> 00:02:40,062
The son mistook me for her
the other day.

53
00:02:40,086 --> 00:02:43,696
Today, the mom
lifted up my shirt for no reason.

54
00:02:44,156 --> 00:02:47,006
What problem
does that family have with me?

55
00:02:49,996 --> 00:02:53,446
Do I look that similar
to Park Do Ra?

56
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:08,087
(Park Do Ra)

57
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:11,057
Goodness.

58
00:03:12,656 --> 00:03:14,726
Look how pretty she was.

59
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:26,976
I'm nothing like her,
so what's their problem?

60
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:40,786
Grandma, it's me.

61
00:03:41,186 --> 00:03:42,897
Hey, Ji Young.

62
00:03:43,417 --> 00:03:45,666
Grandma, I'm your granddaughter,
aren't I?

63
00:03:46,257 --> 00:03:49,296
Of course you are.
Why would you ask me that?

64
00:03:49,956 --> 00:03:52,026
Some lady kept saying...

65
00:03:52,026 --> 00:03:53,807
that I was her daughter.

66
00:03:54,227 --> 00:03:57,536
What? What was that?

67
00:03:58,406 --> 00:03:59,807
Where on earth are you?

68
00:03:59,936 --> 00:04:03,217
Is that crazy lady still there?

69
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:06,946
Who does she think she is
claiming rights to my granddaughter?

70
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:08,917
I'll head over there...

71
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:11,847
and pluck all the hair
from her head.

72
00:04:11,847 --> 00:04:15,196
It's all right, Grandma.
The crazy lady left.

73
00:04:15,817 --> 00:04:19,027
I'm your granddaughter
for sure, right?

74
00:04:19,227 --> 00:04:21,066
Of course you are.

75
00:04:21,526 --> 00:04:25,907
You are Lee Soon Jung's
one and only granddaughter.

76
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,867
Sure thing, Grandma.

77
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:30,507
I'm your one and only granddaughter.

78
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:33,277
Ji Young.

79
00:04:33,737 --> 00:04:35,336
After your parents...

80
00:04:35,336 --> 00:04:38,217
passed away on the same day
in a car accident,

81
00:04:38,677 --> 00:04:41,186
you were all I had to live for.

82
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,717
When you come across
that crazy lady again,

83
00:04:44,786 --> 00:04:47,346
kick her in the shins. Got it?

84
00:04:47,346 --> 00:04:49,957
Got it, Grandma. Don't worry.

85
00:04:50,387 --> 00:04:54,096
Honestly, I think
it was the alcohol talking.

86
00:04:55,057 --> 00:04:58,637
Sure thing, Grandma.
I'll be in touch.

87
00:04:59,127 --> 00:05:00,267
Bye.

88
00:05:03,367 --> 00:05:04,577
Of course.

89
00:05:04,807 --> 00:05:08,077
That crazy lady
was drunk and talking nonsense.

Ji Young.

93
00:05:23,687 --> 00:05:25,567
I safely landed in Paris.

94
00:05:25,687 --> 00:05:27,726
I'm glad to hear that.

95
00:05:28,396 --> 00:05:29,697
How are things there?

96
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:32,907
It's all great other than the fact
that you're not here.

97
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:34,796
Director Ko, my gosh.

98
00:05:34,796 --> 00:05:38,306
Can you stop it
with the cheesy flattery?

99
00:05:38,966 --> 00:05:40,676
It was the truth, not a flattery.

100
00:05:41,406 --> 00:05:43,507
Anyway, we should
come here together...

101
00:05:43,507 --> 00:05:44,746
once we're done filming our series.

102
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:49,317
Sounds good. I've always wanted
to go somewhere that nice.

103
00:05:52,517 --> 00:05:53,887
Director Ko,

104
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:57,726
you look like a Parisian
with that scene in the background.

105
00:05:58,017 --> 00:05:59,496
I'm in awe.

106
00:06:00,356 --> 00:06:01,567
Thanks for that.

107
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:04,166
Baby chick!

108
00:06:04,396 --> 00:06:05,536
What?

109
00:06:08,937 --> 00:06:10,236
Chirp.

110
00:06:11,767 --> 00:06:13,937
Goodness me. Let's hang up for now.

111
00:06:13,937 --> 00:06:15,676
We'll talk again soon.

112
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:23,257
How silly of him.

113
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:27,127
Why would he do that
when he's in Paris of all places?

114
00:06:27,617 --> 00:06:29,226
You silly man.

115
00:06:34,286 --> 00:06:36,796
Pil Seung, show us your trophy.

116
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:39,866
Pil Seung, let us see it.

117
00:06:40,927 --> 00:06:42,536
- Here you go.
- No way!

118
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:45,137
- Goodness.
- Pil Seung.

119
00:06:45,137 --> 00:06:46,906
It must be because it's foreign,

120
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,783
but that is one
sophisticated trophy.

121
00:06:48,807 --> 00:06:51,277
Pil Seung, I'm so proud of you.

122
00:06:51,476 --> 00:06:54,346
Don't leave it behind
and make sure to bring it home.

123
00:06:54,507 --> 00:06:55,517
Got it.

124
00:06:55,517 --> 00:06:58,286
Pil Seung, my son. Congratulations.

125
00:06:58,286 --> 00:07:00,627
Do your best and get home safely.

126
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,296
Pil Seung, when will you be back?

127
00:07:03,716 --> 00:07:04,817
In two days.

128
00:07:04,817 --> 00:07:06,926
Who's on the phone? Your girlfriend?

129
00:07:07,356 --> 00:07:08,927
Would you like to say hi
to my family?

130
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:09,956
Should I?

- It's Cha Bong Soo!
- Hello,

132
00:07:11,997 --> 00:07:13,627
- I'm Cha Bong Soo.
- My gosh.

133
00:07:13,627 --> 00:07:15,737
- Mom, here.
- Thank you.

Have a seat.

142
00:07:54,036 --> 00:07:57,947
I was just reading the article
about Pil Seung winning the award.

143
00:07:58,947 --> 00:08:00,077
- Really?
- Yes.

144
00:08:00,077 --> 00:08:01,276
Thanks for that.

145
00:08:01,276 --> 00:08:04,476
I can't believe he managed
to win an award that prestigious.

what just happened.

148

It's all thanks to you
raising him well.

- Yes?

154
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:25,307
that the contract you offered him...

155
00:08:25,307 --> 00:08:28,306
was almost groundbreaking
in this industry.

156
00:08:28,807 --> 00:08:30,317
Are you sure about it?

157
00:08:30,437 --> 00:08:32,017
Don't be ridiculous.

158
00:08:32,247 --> 00:08:36,286
I only offered him that deal
because he's worthy of every penny.

159
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,786
I'm the one who's honored...

160
00:08:38,786 --> 00:08:40,887
to have signed
a director that talented.

161
00:08:41,286 --> 00:08:44,597
Thank you for thinking fondly
of my son.

162

he might disappoint you...

a signing bonus that huge.

165
00:08:52,896 --> 00:08:55,977
Gosh. Why would you
worry about that?

166

I don't know
how I'll be able to do it,

171
00:09:13,347 --> 00:09:15,717
but I'll start
by keeping your fridge stocked...

172
00:09:15,717 --> 00:09:17,926
with your favorite kind of kimchi.

173
00:09:18,757 --> 00:09:21,997

175

He won a trophy at that award?

184
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:51,097
Yes, the Best Director Award.

185
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,487
The Juniper Award
is known to be prestigious.

186
00:09:54,487 --> 00:09:55,957
He's incredible.

187
00:09:55,957 --> 00:09:58,536
Right? Isn't Pil Seung the best?

188
00:09:58,926 --> 00:10:01,007
He grew up so nicely.

189
00:10:01,166 --> 00:10:02,336
My gosh.

190
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,247
Ma Ri.

191
00:10:05,707 --> 00:10:09,012
Are you sure you like him
only as a brother figure?

192
00:10:09,036 --> 00:10:11,853
What does that mean?

193
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:14,946
I think you still like him a lot.

194
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:19,387
It can't happen.
Pil Seung and I can't be. Never.

195
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:20,727
You can't be together?

196
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:23,326
Why not? Why is it "never?"

197
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:27,696
Because... That's...

198
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:31,796
It's...

199
00:10:33,127 --> 00:10:34,767
Whatever. It's a secret.

200
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:37,936
However close we are,
I can't tell you that.

201
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,306
Okay, I get how you feel.

202
00:10:44,536 --> 00:10:47,316
Do Jun. What's all this for?

203
00:10:48,046 --> 00:10:50,987
I'm going to enter
an architecture competition.

204
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:52,463
There's a big cash award.

205
00:10:52,487 --> 00:10:55,696
An architecture competition?
You can do that?

206
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,826
I used to study architecture.

207
00:10:59,887 --> 00:11:02,637
Oh, I see.

208
00:11:02,727 --> 00:11:05,607
I thought these small things
were all toys.

209
00:11:06,426 --> 00:11:08,367
They're not, so don't touch them.

210
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:12,507
Park Do Jun, you're so cool.

211
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:14,107
Not really.

212
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:15,916
Do you want a look?

213
00:11:29,087 --> 00:11:30,296
Let me see!

214
00:11:32,487 --> 00:11:34,387
What's your problem?

215
00:11:34,387 --> 00:11:36,666
What do you think you're doing?

216
00:11:38,826 --> 00:11:39,966
No.

217
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:44,036
How on earth can she be my Do Ra?
Just look at her.

218
00:11:44,066 --> 00:11:45,743
How could that country bumpkin
be my Do Ra?

219
00:11:45,767 --> 00:11:47,507
That's impossible.

220
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:54,147
But how does she have three moles
in just the same triangle?

221
00:11:55,176 --> 00:11:56,716
Is that that common?

222
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:02,117
It's so itchy.

223
00:12:02,117 --> 00:12:04,956
Oh, my gosh. Let's see.

224
00:12:06,487 --> 00:12:08,527
Did you have something with walnuts?

225
00:12:08,696 --> 00:12:11,166
Bi Bi offered me walnut pie,
so I had just one mouthful.

226
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:13,737
I swear I ate just a little.

227
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:15,977
You silly thing. Let me see!

228
00:12:17,796 --> 00:12:20,237
My gosh. You have a rash all over.

229
00:12:20,237 --> 00:12:22,377
I told you
not to eat anything with walnuts.

230
00:12:22,377 --> 00:12:26,176
You break out in hives
if you have even a tiny amount.

231
00:12:26,176 --> 00:12:27,782
Your shoot is ruined now.

232
00:12:27,806 --> 00:12:29,757
What are we to do?

233
00:12:32,847 --> 00:12:35,956
That's right.
Do Ra was allergic to walnuts.

234
00:12:36,587 --> 00:12:38,997
If the country bumpkin
is also allergic to walnuts...

235
00:12:40,757 --> 00:12:44,267
Like Do Sik said,
Do Ra's body was never found.

236
00:12:45,597 --> 00:12:47,407
There's nothing to prove she's dead.

237
00:13:01,507 --> 00:13:02,657
Cut!

238
00:13:03,276 --> 00:13:05,387
That was amazing.

239
00:13:07,146 --> 00:13:08,323
Jae Dong.

240
00:13:08,347 --> 00:13:10,587
What are you doing here, Ms. Baek?

241
00:13:10,587 --> 00:13:11,887
Isn't Do Do done?

242
00:13:11,887 --> 00:13:15,203
I was nearby and I thought of you,
so I dropped by.

243
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:16,836
It's your last shoot, right?

244
00:13:16,957 --> 00:13:18,267
Yes, it is.

245
00:13:18,526 --> 00:13:21,706
We don't cross paths often,
so we should meet when we can.

246
00:13:21,796 --> 00:13:23,066
Did you have lunch?

247
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:25,676
I'm waiting until Ji Young's done
to eat with her.

248
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:27,107
I see.

249
00:13:27,237 --> 00:13:28,916
That was a great scene.

250
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:31,152
Hey, that's perfect.

251
00:13:31,176 --> 00:13:34,316
I made a sweet potato smoothie
to have for lunch,

252
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:36,176
but someone invited me to eat.

253
00:13:36,176 --> 00:13:37,247
Try it.

254
00:13:37,247 --> 00:13:38,716
- Thank you.
- Sure.

255
00:13:39,587 --> 00:13:40,727
Here.

256
00:13:42,957 --> 00:13:44,127
Gosh.

257
00:13:47,357 --> 00:13:49,666
No way. It tastes amazing.

258
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:51,796
- Does it? That's great.
- Yes.

259
00:13:51,796 --> 00:13:54,706
You can have it.
Share it with your actress.

260
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:57,597
- Thanks so much, Ms. Baek.
- Sure.

261
00:13:57,597 --> 00:14:00,683
Don't drink it all.
Be sure to share with her.

262
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:02,906
You know a manager should
look out for their actors, right?

263
00:14:02,906 --> 00:14:04,776
Yes, I do. I'll give her some.

264
00:14:04,776 --> 00:14:05,987
Okay.

265
00:14:06,377 --> 00:14:09,456
- Not at all.
- No, really.

266
00:14:09,576 --> 00:14:10,946
- I have to go.
- Okay.

267
00:14:10,946 --> 00:14:12,217
- Take care.
- I will.

268
00:14:12,217 --> 00:14:14,357
Let's do another take!

269
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:16,397
This looks great.

270
00:14:26,396 --> 00:14:27,666
That punk.

271
00:14:27,896 --> 00:14:30,407
Is he drinking it all? My gosh.

272
00:14:30,997 --> 00:14:32,306
How dare he?

273
00:14:35,737 --> 00:14:37,076
Cut, okay! Great!

274
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:43,076
You did so well, Ji Young.

275
00:14:43,076 --> 00:14:44,347
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

276
00:14:44,347 --> 00:14:45,487
Drink this.

277
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,426
- Here.
- What is this?

278
00:14:48,786 --> 00:14:51,693
It's a sweet potato smoothie.
It tastes amazing. Try it.

279
00:14:51,717 --> 00:14:52,867
Really?

280
00:14:57,896 --> 00:14:59,206
It's nice.

281
00:15:03,066 --> 00:15:04,936
Is there walnuts in this?

282
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:06,576
Walnuts?

283
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:08,247
I don't know. Why?

284
00:15:08,737 --> 00:15:10,676
It tastes like walnuts.

285
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,147
I'm allergic to walnuts.

286
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:14,546
You are?

287
00:15:18,276 --> 00:15:19,556
I think you're right.

288
00:15:23,816 --> 00:15:27,367
I think there were walnuts in there.

289
00:15:28,156 --> 00:15:29,336
Darn it.

290
00:15:32,127 --> 00:15:33,336
Hang on.

291
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:38,377
Don't scratch yourself.

292
00:15:40,967 --> 00:15:42,806
- Hi, Jae Dong.
- Hello.

293
00:15:42,806 --> 00:15:45,546
Are there walnuts
in the sweet potato smoothie?

294
00:15:46,276 --> 00:15:50,586
Yes. I added some
for a nutty flavor. Why?

295
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:53,286
Ji Young has an allergy.

296
00:15:54,747 --> 00:15:55,897
My gosh.

297
00:15:56,457 --> 00:15:57,997
She has a walnut allergy?

298
00:15:58,786 --> 00:16:01,897
Take her to the ER.
That's dangerous.

299
00:16:01,926 --> 00:16:03,532
I'll call you later.

300
00:16:03,556 --> 00:16:04,867
- Okay.
- Bye.

301
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:06,507
Wait a moment.

302
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:10,407
My goodness.

303
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:14,277
She has a walnut allergy too?

304
00:16:15,306 --> 00:16:17,216
What's going on? Is she Do Ra?

305
00:16:19,306 --> 00:16:20,446
No.

306
00:16:21,276 --> 00:16:23,987
How could she be Do Ra
when she looks so different?

307
00:16:25,046 --> 00:16:26,556
What happened?

308
00:16:38,026 --> 00:16:41,737
My gosh.
Why are you doing this to me, lady?

309
00:16:43,637 --> 00:16:46,507
Lady. Stop right there.

310
00:16:46,607 --> 00:16:48,007
Stop where you are!

311
00:16:49,806 --> 00:16:50,946
Goodness.

312
00:16:51,536 --> 00:16:53,617
She's really out of her mind.

313
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,347
She's crazy.

314
00:16:55,617 --> 00:16:57,157
She needs to see a doctor.

315
00:16:57,747 --> 00:17:00,786
Darn it. Do I have a bald spot?

316
00:17:02,887 --> 00:17:04,027
Shoot.

317
00:17:04,587 --> 00:17:07,497
Here are the samples.

318
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:13,166
When will the results be out?
I need them fast.

319
00:17:13,227 --> 00:17:15,107
- I understand.
- Okay.

320
00:17:17,366 --> 00:17:20,913
Tae Hee.
I just ate out with that woman,

321
00:17:20,937 --> 00:17:23,946
and the director punched me
calling her his woman.

322
00:17:24,806 --> 00:17:26,446
Should I have put up with that?

323
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:29,276
I'd make no excuses
if I were seeing her,

324
00:17:29,276 --> 00:17:31,376
but there was nothing between us.

325
00:17:31,376 --> 00:17:33,186
- He misunderstood and hit me...
- That's enough.

326
00:17:33,987 --> 00:17:35,586
I could have let it go if I were...

327
00:17:35,586 --> 00:17:37,327
the only witness to the fight.

328
00:17:37,786 --> 00:17:39,196
But you got into a fight...

329
00:17:39,487 --> 00:17:40,826
at an opening ceremony...

330
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:43,137
in front of a crowd
that included your fiancée.

331
00:17:43,826 --> 00:17:45,337
I can't forgive you for that.

332
00:17:46,126 --> 00:17:48,807
It's not like she was
someone worth dating.

333
00:17:49,497 --> 00:17:51,736
You were fighting over someone
who isn't on my level.

334
00:17:52,336 --> 00:17:54,077
I feel like you insulted me too.

335
00:17:55,776 --> 00:17:57,476
I don't ever want to see you again.

336
00:17:59,507 --> 00:18:00,647
Tae Hee.

337
00:18:08,286 --> 00:18:11,611
(Provides grounds that A and B
are mother and daughter.)

338
00:18:14,286 --> 00:18:18,597
So... What does this mean?

339
00:18:19,296 --> 00:18:23,077
Does it mean
the two are mother and daughter?

340
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:25,006
Yes, it does.

341
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,877
Oh, dear. Are you all right?

342
00:18:31,907 --> 00:18:34,617
Doctor! We need help!

343
00:18:35,106 --> 00:18:36,287
Are you okay?

344
00:18:38,477 --> 00:18:41,357
Mom, what happened?
Are you all right?

345
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:44,726
- Do Sik.
- What?

346
00:18:45,826 --> 00:18:47,496
Do Ra's alive.

347
00:18:47,757 --> 00:18:49,496
Our Do Ra's alive.

348
00:18:49,856 --> 00:18:51,367
What are you talking about?

349
00:18:52,126 --> 00:18:54,197
Is it because
I said the tenant girl...

350
00:18:54,197 --> 00:18:55,837
looked like Do Ra?

351
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:58,866
I'll stop saying that nonsense.
Will you pull yourself together?

352
00:18:58,866 --> 00:19:00,746
- I'm serious.
- That hurts.

353
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:03,677
It's not a dream.
It can't be a dream.

354
00:19:03,677 --> 00:19:06,483
Hang on, the report.
Where's the test report?

355
00:19:06,507 --> 00:19:09,686
- What did you test?
- Here, read this.

356
00:19:09,747 --> 00:19:12,286
I got a gene test done. Take a look.

357
00:19:12,286 --> 00:19:14,286
- Read it.
- A gene test for whom?

358
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:15,993
Me and Kim Ji Young.

359
00:19:16,017 --> 00:19:18,086
I pulled out some of her hairs
and tested them...

360
00:19:18,086 --> 00:19:20,127
and that's the result, Do Sik.

361
00:19:20,157 --> 00:19:22,326
She's Do Ra. She really is.

362
00:19:22,326 --> 00:19:24,196
Is this for real, Mom?

363
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:30,736
Do Ra. Let's talk.

364
00:19:31,866 --> 00:19:33,946
What's up with you now?

365
00:19:35,036 --> 00:19:38,112
Lady. I really think you're crazy.

366
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:41,547
Instead of coming here,
you need to go to a hospital.

367
00:19:41,606 --> 00:19:43,956
Listen. My mom's not crazy.

368
00:19:44,447 --> 00:19:47,657
It won't take long. We have
something important to discuss.

369
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:50,297
Can we please have a chat?

370
00:19:52,086 --> 00:19:54,897
What could be so important
that you'd do this?

371
00:20:02,796 --> 00:20:03,976
What is this?

372
00:20:04,366 --> 00:20:06,307
Why are you showing this to me?

373
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:10,782
It's the DNA test result
of you and my mom.

374
00:20:10,806 --> 00:20:12,887
It says she and you are
a mother and a daughter.

375
00:20:13,407 --> 00:20:14,547
What did you say?

376
00:20:17,017 --> 00:20:20,186
Are you saying
this lady is my mother?

377
00:20:20,447 --> 00:20:23,556
Yes. You are my daughter.

378
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,217
Do Sik felt the same way,

379
00:20:25,217 --> 00:20:27,126
and I kept feeling like
you were Do Ra.

380
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:30,602
So I pulled out your hair
and sent it in for a DNA test.

381
00:20:30,626 --> 00:20:32,837
That was the only option I had.

382
00:20:33,397 --> 00:20:34,526
Listen.

383
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:38,237
Don't you have three moles
in a triangle shape on your back?

384
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,007
That's what my Do Ra had.

385
00:20:40,007 --> 00:20:42,483
And you're allergic
to walnuts, right?

386
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:45,336
Do Ra was also allergic to walnuts.

387
00:20:45,336 --> 00:20:47,317
You are my Do Ra.

388
00:20:47,407 --> 00:20:50,177
Ma'am. Even though
my parents passed away...

389
00:20:50,177 --> 00:20:53,346
in an accident
when I was in elementary school,

390
00:20:53,346 --> 00:20:55,856
I still had my own parents.

391
00:20:55,856 --> 00:20:57,987
And my grandmother is still alive.

392
00:20:57,987 --> 00:21:00,703
Then how could you
possibly be my mom?

393
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:03,266
A mole on my side?
An allergy to walnuts?

394
00:21:03,326 --> 00:21:05,897
That's something
that anyone can have.

395
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:07,967
And I don't believe stuff like this.

396
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,976
This must be fabricated.

397
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:13,267
Do Ra, don't you remember anything?
Do you not recognize us?

398
00:21:13,267 --> 00:21:15,306
Seriously, why are you
being like this?

399
00:21:15,306 --> 00:21:17,376
I don't remember anything.

400
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:18,547
And...

401
00:21:19,576 --> 00:21:22,246
An ignorant lady like her
can't be my mom.

402
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:26,287
- I should get going.
- Wait.

403
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,987
If you don't believe me,

404
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,956
you should come with me
for a DNA test.

405
00:21:31,316 --> 00:21:33,556
I'm begging you.
Please just give it a try.

406
00:21:33,556 --> 00:21:35,127
You never know
how things will turn out.

407
00:21:36,026 --> 00:21:37,236
What...

408
00:21:44,467 --> 00:21:46,676
(Korea Genetic Analysis Center)

409
00:21:50,036 --> 00:21:52,147
(Provides grounds that A and B
are mother and daughter.)

410
00:21:53,076 --> 00:21:55,647
That's true. You're Do Ra.

411
00:21:56,046 --> 00:21:57,052
Do Ra.

412
00:21:57,076 --> 00:21:58,717
That's right.

413
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:02,147
The test proves
the mother-child relationship.

414
00:22:02,147 --> 00:22:04,616
Do Ra, you're my daughter.

415
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:08,327
Do Ra. You are my precious daughter.

416
00:22:08,526 --> 00:22:09,696
Do Ra.

417
00:22:09,856 --> 00:22:12,637
- Do Ra...
- Get off me.

418
00:22:13,526 --> 00:22:14,736
No.

419
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,807
I'm Kim Ji Young.

420
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:20,107
My grandmother is alive.

421
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:22,683
I'm her granddaughter.

422
00:22:22,707 --> 00:22:25,986
Okay. We should go
to your grandmother together.

423
00:22:26,147 --> 00:22:29,147
Let's go and find out
how you became her granddaughter...

424
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:33,062
and how your face changed like this.
She must know everything.

425
00:22:33,086 --> 00:22:35,127
Let's go together.

426
00:22:35,586 --> 00:22:37,456
I don't know what happened.

427
00:22:38,217 --> 00:22:41,067
I don't want to talk to you now.

428
00:22:41,657 --> 00:22:43,757
Do Ra! Hurry and catch her.

429
00:22:43,757 --> 00:22:45,296
- Do Ra.
- Go!

430
00:22:45,296 --> 00:22:47,137
Do Ra...

431
00:22:54,036 --> 00:22:56,636
Do Ra. Wait.

432
00:22:56,636 --> 00:22:58,407
Do Ra.

433
00:22:58,407 --> 00:23:00,787
My goodness. Do Ra!

434
00:23:11,157 --> 00:23:12,897
What on earth is going on?

435
00:23:16,727 --> 00:23:18,166
If this is true,

436
00:23:18,826 --> 00:23:20,506
does that mean I'm Park Do Ra?

437
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:26,206
And Grandma isn't my real grandma?

438
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:34,287
When I nearly drowned two years ago,

439
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:37,416
was I switched
with Grandma's granddaughter?

440
00:23:38,846 --> 00:23:41,857
Grandma was mistaken
because of her dementia?

441
00:23:45,972 --> 00:23:49,281
(Grilled Shrimp)

442
00:23:49,311 --> 00:23:52,191
(Fresh Grilled Clams)

443
00:23:56,313 --> 00:23:57,482
Grandma.

444
00:23:57,882 --> 00:24:00,383
What? Hey.

445
00:24:00,582 --> 00:24:03,093
What are you doing here?
You didn't even call me.

446
00:24:04,182 --> 00:24:06,969
I came here because I missed you.

447
00:24:06,993 --> 00:24:10,232
I suddenly craved your noodle dish.

448
00:24:10,931 --> 00:24:12,431
I'm hungry, Grandma.

449
00:24:12,431 --> 00:24:16,261
You are? My dear baby.

450
00:24:16,261 --> 00:24:18,300
Wait just a little while.

451
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,370
I'll make you noodles right away.

452
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:23,480
All right.

453
00:24:28,681 --> 00:24:31,220
I look just like Grandma.

454
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:35,290
How is it possible
that I'm the lady's daughter?

455
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:41,260
You said you were hungry.
Why are you picking at your food?

456
00:24:42,221 --> 00:24:44,531
You really like...

457
00:24:44,531 --> 00:24:46,491
the kalguksu I make.

458
00:24:46,491 --> 00:24:49,701
Try this.
It's freshly-made geotjeori.

459
00:24:49,701 --> 00:24:51,971
Eat your noodles...

460
00:24:51,971 --> 00:24:53,971
with this geotjeori.

461
00:24:53,971 --> 00:24:55,271
- Go ahead and eat it.
- Okay.

462
00:24:55,271 --> 00:24:57,010
Here. Eat it.

463
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:07,850
Your kalguksu is the best.

464
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:10,091
- You think?
- And the geotjeori is good too.

465
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,131
By the way,

466
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,101
what's with your face?

467
00:25:20,261 --> 00:25:24,371
Why do you look so upset and gloomy?

468
00:25:25,201 --> 00:25:28,381
Did you come here to see me
because there's something wrong?

469
00:25:29,671 --> 00:25:33,151
I'm not upset or gloomy at all.

470
00:25:33,911 --> 00:25:36,381
I just came here
because I missed you.

471
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,850
Are you here...

472
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:42,391
because you're worried about me?

473
00:25:43,221 --> 00:25:46,921
I told you not to be like that.

474
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:49,661
If you're worried,
you can just call me.

475
00:25:49,661 --> 00:25:51,970
We can talk on the phone.

476
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,470
Well...

477
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,641
Grandma.

478
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:02,811
How did you find me two years ago?

479
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,611
You silly thing.

480
00:26:05,741 --> 00:26:08,220
Why are you asking me that again?

481
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,881
I'm just asking.

482
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:15,020
I went to dig out
some Manila clams...

483
00:26:15,421 --> 00:26:17,861
with my neighbors one day.

484
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:21,301
And you were lying face down
on the rock.

485
00:26:21,491 --> 00:26:25,030
So I saved you.

486
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:27,300
I was lying on the rock?

487
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,571
Yes.

488
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:31,870
Some people in the neighborhood said
you ran away...

489
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:34,001
because you were sick
of this country village.

490
00:26:34,001 --> 00:26:37,881
And some said
you went to a city and died.

491
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,810
But I had a feeling...

492
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:42,840
you lost your footing and fell...

493
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,121
while going around the beach.

494
00:26:45,511 --> 00:26:48,520
And just as I expected,

495
00:26:49,251 --> 00:26:51,320
you were swept away by the waves...

496
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,591
and almost died.

497
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,491
That's how my face changed, right?

498
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:57,970
And I don't remember anything.

499
00:26:58,191 --> 00:27:00,301
Of course.

500
00:27:00,461 --> 00:27:01,871
Oh, dear.

501
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,641
Seriously, you were
in a total wreck back then.

502
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,881
I wasn't sure if you'd be okay
even if you survived.

503
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:11,551
Gosh.

504
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:16,180
By the way, why are you asking that
all of a sudden?

505
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,720
What?

506
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,880
It's nothing.

507
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,681
I don't remember anything,

508
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:24,091
so I was just frustrated.

509
00:27:24,991 --> 00:27:27,190
But not much.
I'm just a little frustrated.

510
00:27:28,161 --> 00:27:29,401
Ji Young.

511
00:27:30,021 --> 00:27:32,731
It's okay
even if you don't remember anything.

512
00:27:32,731 --> 00:27:35,671
What's important is
that you're alive.

513
00:27:35,761 --> 00:27:37,641
Don't you think so?

514
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,440
Go ahead and eat it.

515
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,140
Make sure to eat a lot.

516
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,750
Okay. I will.

517
00:27:45,511 --> 00:27:46,651
All right.

518
00:28:17,511 --> 00:28:19,450
Things got so screwed up for me...

519
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,280
because of that witch, Kim Ji Young.

520
00:28:24,251 --> 00:28:25,450
That darn brat.

521
00:28:28,021 --> 00:28:30,621
Who is she
to ruin my life like this?

522
00:28:45,001 --> 00:28:46,471
- My gosh. Hey.
- Gosh.

523
00:28:46,471 --> 00:28:48,276
- How is it? Doesn't it smell nice?
- Yes.

524
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,151
You should take good care
of yourself when you're tired.

525
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:54,680
So I got you one set each.

526
00:28:54,741 --> 00:28:57,490
Make sure to spray it every day
while thinking about me.

527
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,591
This is nice.

528
00:29:00,751 --> 00:29:04,290
Thanks to Ma Ri, our feet
are receiving the royal treatment.

529
00:29:05,021 --> 00:29:07,961
I like how nice and dry
my feet are. Right, Sun Young?

530
00:29:07,961 --> 00:29:09,161
You're absolutely right.

531
00:29:09,161 --> 00:29:12,301
Ma Ri, thank you so much.

532
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,770
There's no need to thank me.

533
00:29:15,161 --> 00:29:16,401
By the way,

534
00:29:16,961 --> 00:29:18,911
it's pretty late.

535
00:29:19,031 --> 00:29:20,740
Won't your parents be worried?

536
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:24,980
I got permission
to stay here late today.

537
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,980
Could I perhaps stay the night...

538
00:29:29,981 --> 00:29:32,391
in Granny's room?

539
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:34,190
What?

540
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:37,690
I wouldn't mind it at all,

541
00:29:37,751 --> 00:29:39,561
but your parents wouldn't approve.

542
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:44,530
Your mom hates you coming over here.

543
00:29:45,261 --> 00:29:48,100
My mom can't say anything
about me coming here anymore,

544
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,710
and my dad lets me do
whatever I want.

545
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,741
Maybe it's because
this is Pil Seung's house,

546
00:29:54,741 --> 00:29:57,340
but I feel at home
whenever I'm here.

547
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,551
It's more fun here than at my place.

548
00:30:01,411 --> 00:30:04,650
Besides, Granny and I are friends.

549
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,450
I should play with you.

550
00:30:07,211 --> 00:30:10,020
Right, of course. Thanks for that.

551
00:30:11,491 --> 00:30:14,930
It's like I'm babysitting
at this age.

552
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:17,890
Until when
must I be friends with her?

553
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:20,230
Her coming by here is getting old.

554
00:30:21,261 --> 00:30:23,907
I opted to be her friend
when I thought she could be...

555
00:30:23,931 --> 00:30:25,710
my granddaughter-in-law,

556
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:28,141
but what good
would being friends with her do?

557
00:30:29,271 --> 00:30:32,540
Why did she suddenly
have a change of heart?

558
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,941
Rather than her boyfriend,

559
00:30:33,941 --> 00:30:36,480
she only wants Pil Seung
as her brother figure.

560
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,150
She's a pain in the neck.

561
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,351
Kim Ji Young!

562
00:30:41,221 --> 00:30:42,690
Kim Ji Young, get out here!

563
00:30:43,921 --> 00:30:45,126
Kim Ji Young!

564
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:48,161
- What on earth is that?
- Kim Ji Young!

565
00:30:48,661 --> 00:30:50,801
His voice sounds awfully familiar.

566
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,571
- What?
- Hey!

567
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:55,970
Hey, Kim Ji Young!

568
00:30:57,161 --> 00:30:58,641
Kim Ji Young!

569
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,811
Goodness, isn't that...

570
00:31:02,171 --> 00:31:04,741
- Hold on.
- Who on earth is that?

571
00:31:04,741 --> 00:31:06,510
Goodness.

572
00:31:12,511 --> 00:31:14,591
What? It's my uncle.

573
00:31:14,781 --> 00:31:16,290
Are you kidding me?

574
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,990
Hey, Kim Ji Young!

575
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:21,096
Get out here.

576
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,861
- Can't you hear me?
- Jin Dan, my gosh.

577
00:31:24,191 --> 00:31:26,290
What are you doing here?
What's going on?

578
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:27,500
Ms. Kim.

579
00:31:27,931 --> 00:31:30,141
Ms. Kim, I...

580
00:31:31,031 --> 00:31:33,611
I have a lot to say to Kim Ji Young.

581
00:31:34,171 --> 00:31:37,141
But she won't come out
no matter how much I call for her.

582
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:39,640
Ms. Kim, can you call her
out here instead?

583
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,351
Kim Ji Young!

584
00:31:41,741 --> 00:31:45,151
Get out here, will you?
Kim Ji Young...

585
00:31:45,511 --> 00:31:46,850
Come on.

586
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:49,820
Jin Dan, she hasn't come home yet,

587
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,561
so head on home.

588
00:31:51,921 --> 00:31:55,161
Goodness. Let me catch you a cab.
Let's go.

589
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,601
No, I'm not leaving.

590
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:02,671
I won't go anywhere until I see...

591
00:32:03,161 --> 00:32:05,031
Kim Ji Young.

592
00:32:05,031 --> 00:32:06,770
- I won't leave.
- Sun Young.

593
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:09,001
Can you get me some water?

594
00:32:09,001 --> 00:32:12,911
Jin Dan, get a grip on yourself
and go home!

595
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,551
I'm doomed.

596
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,720
My life has been ruined
because of you.

597
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:23,020
Who do you think you are?

598
00:32:23,781 --> 00:32:26,290
Who are you to ruin my life?

599
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:31,230
Who are you
to make my life miserable?

600
00:32:33,991 --> 00:32:36,901
You! You'll take care of me.

601
00:32:37,701 --> 00:32:40,611
Take care of me, Ji Young!

602
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,210
Honey, don't you think Ma Ri
is running a little late?

603
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:48,741
She wanted to congratulate Pil Seung
on winning the award,

604
00:32:48,741 --> 00:32:49,950
so she'll be home soon.

605
00:32:50,481 --> 00:32:51,711
But I thought Ma Ri...

606
00:32:51,711 --> 00:32:53,351
didn't have feelings for him anymore.

607
00:32:53,781 --> 00:32:56,321
Why has she been
going back to that house?

608
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,331
Do they have secret treasure?

609
00:32:58,691 --> 00:33:01,901
She doesn't like him romantically,
but thinks of him as a brother.

610
00:33:01,991 --> 00:33:04,601
They agreed to be honorary siblings.

611
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,130
His family must be exhausted...

612
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:09,440
with Ma Ri making a fuss
all the time.

613
00:33:09,961 --> 00:33:11,671
Tell her to come home.

614
00:33:11,701 --> 00:33:13,071
This is inappropriate.

615
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:16,641
- Sure.
- Speak of the devil.

616
00:33:17,711 --> 00:33:18,881
Hey, Ma Ri.

617
00:33:19,241 --> 00:33:21,481
Dad, I'm at Pil Seung's,

618
00:33:21,481 --> 00:33:23,340
and it's a total mess.

619
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,250
You need to come and sort this out.

620
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:29,091
Ma Ri, what do you mean
it's a total mess?

621
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,550
You need to get here.

622
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:33,691
Uncle is drunk and causing a scene.

623
00:33:33,691 --> 00:33:36,760
What? Jin Dan's there?

624
00:33:37,421 --> 00:33:38,507
Jin Dan?

625
00:33:38,531 --> 00:33:41,071
Why would she mention Jin Dan?

626
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,510
I think he fell asleep.

627
00:33:50,171 --> 00:33:51,611
He's really asleep.

628
00:33:51,971 --> 00:33:53,210
He's even snoring.

629
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:59,591
Shouldn't we take him inside
and let him sleep?

630
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:02,460
- Hyun Chul, carry him.
- What?

631
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,760
Don't just stand there.

632
00:34:05,491 --> 00:34:07,961
How could I possibly carry
a young man this tall?

633
00:34:07,961 --> 00:34:09,301
Goodness me.

634
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,131
Myung Dong, go and get a pillow.

635
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:13,831
A pillow? What for?

636
00:34:13,991 --> 00:34:16,461
The last thing we need
is for him to get sick.

637
00:34:16,461 --> 00:34:18,341
We should at least
give him a pillow.

638
00:34:18,531 --> 00:34:19,741
Got it.

639
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:22,480
Dad, over here.

640
00:34:22,641 --> 00:34:24,310
- My goodness.
- What...

641
00:34:24,741 --> 00:34:26,011
Jin Dan, my gosh.

642
00:34:26,311 --> 00:34:28,181
What are you doing here?

643
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:34,020
I apologize...

644
00:34:34,681 --> 00:34:37,456
for how my family
inconvenienced you again.

645
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,761
I'm truly sorry.

646
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:42,721
- That's life, I guess.
- Get up.

647
00:34:42,721 --> 00:34:44,391
Get up this instant.

648
00:34:44,391 --> 00:34:47,460
Mom, stop it. Let me sleep.

649
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,601
Get up this instant.

650
00:34:48,601 --> 00:34:51,210
Come to your senses
and let us take you home.

651
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:54,071
Hey, Mom.

652
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,710
I'm not going.

653
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,080
I won't.

654
00:34:58,411 --> 00:35:02,380
I won't leave
until I see Kim Ji Young.

655
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,956
- I...
- You've lost your mind.

656
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:08,020
Jin Dan, your brother's here.
Get up this instant.

657
00:35:11,221 --> 00:35:13,631
Jin Taek...

658
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,230
- Gosh.
- My gosh.

659
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,000
You imbecile!

660
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,671
Jin Dan.

661
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,511
Mr. Kim, Mr. Oh, take him away.

662
00:35:36,811 --> 00:35:38,851
I'm terribly sorry.

663
00:35:38,851 --> 00:35:40,190
Sun Young, I'm sorry.

664
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,830
We're sorry.

665
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:51,270
I apologize
for the unwanted commotion.

666
00:35:51,891 --> 00:35:54,841
I will make an official apology
some other day.

667
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,310
Ma Ri, come with us.

668
00:35:58,730 --> 00:35:59,940
Sure, Dad.

669
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,551
I'm so sorry.

670
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:15,060
Let go of me.

671
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:23,431
Mr. Kim, Mr. Oh, thank you.

672
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,577
You fool!

673
00:36:34,601 --> 00:36:36,611
Why don't we just die?

674
00:36:37,041 --> 00:36:40,350
You and I should just die.

675
00:36:44,681 --> 00:36:45,850
Mom.

676
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:49,491
Mom, can't you leave me be?

677
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,690
Please, not now.

678
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,761
Let me be.

679
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:59,230
Jin Dan,
you're not acting like yourself.

680
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:01,401
What has gotten into you?

681
00:37:02,031 --> 00:37:05,007
If she had been a decent young lady,

682
00:37:05,031 --> 00:37:06,870
I would've understood you.

683
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:09,011
But why did it have to be her?

684
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,580
Why did you have to fall
for someone like her?

685
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,511
Is...

686
00:37:14,011 --> 00:37:16,620
Is there a reason
you can't help yourself?

687
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,361
Mom...

688
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:24,660
Yes, Jin Dan. I'm all ears.

689
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,330
Ji Young...

690
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,770
looks like Do Ra.

691
00:37:33,031 --> 00:37:34,841
What?

692
00:37:35,531 --> 00:37:36,940
Who does she resemble?

693
00:37:39,831 --> 00:37:41,640
Ji Young is like Do Ra,

694
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,310
and I keep wanting to see her.

695
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:49,651
I want her to be a replacement
for Do Ra.

696
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,390
Do Ra...

697
00:37:54,721 --> 00:37:56,060
Do Ra.

698
00:37:57,081 --> 00:37:58,830
I'm so sorry.

699
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:01,960
Please come back, Do Ra. I'm sorry.

700
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,701
- I'm sorry.
- What am I going to do with you?

701
00:38:04,561 --> 00:38:05,830
Oh, no.

702
00:38:07,491 --> 00:38:10,241
My gosh. You're out of your mind.

703
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,440
You've lost it.

no genetic family relationship.)

00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:42,440
What on earth is this?

707
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,040
How could this be?

708
00:38:51,411 --> 00:38:54,980
Is my grandma
not really my grandmother?

00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,190
Does that mean
I'm really Park Do Ra?

I love you so much, Grandma.

are you back here?

00:40:01,697 --> 00:40:04,007
What kind of mess did you make?

722
00:40:04,836 --> 00:40:07,206
Tell me all about it.

723
00:40:08,566 --> 00:40:10,737
I had time on my hands today,

724
00:40:10,737 --> 00:40:13,047
so I came by
to spend the night with you.

725
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:17,357
Should I not
even when I miss you badly?

726
00:40:18,376 --> 00:40:19,562
Is that true?

727
00:40:19,586 --> 00:40:21,546
Of course it's true.

728
00:40:21,546 --> 00:40:23,987
Ji Young, my gosh.

729
00:40:23,987 --> 00:40:26,356
What did I tell you?

730
00:40:26,356 --> 00:40:28,896
I told you not to worry about me...

731
00:40:28,896 --> 00:40:31,126
and to sleep more
if you have time on your hands.

732
00:40:31,126 --> 00:40:32,903
Sleep is the best medicine.

733
00:40:32,927 --> 00:40:35,677
Why exhaust yourself by coming here?

734
00:40:36,237 --> 00:40:39,777
But seeing you
gives me the energy I need.

735
00:40:40,106 --> 00:40:43,447
You're my favorite person
in this whole world.

736
00:40:44,137 --> 00:40:46,186
Goodness me.

737
00:40:47,577 --> 00:40:48,916
Sure.

738
00:40:49,646 --> 00:40:51,887
My sweet puppy.

739
00:40:52,487 --> 00:40:55,286
My Ji Young.

740
00:40:55,987 --> 00:41:00,226
You're also my favorite person
in this whole world.

741
00:41:13,407 --> 00:41:16,416
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message...

742
00:41:16,776 --> 00:41:17,947
Isn't she picking up?

743
00:41:18,037 --> 00:41:19,706
Her phone is still turned off.

744
00:41:19,706 --> 00:41:21,817
This must've gravely shocked her.

745
00:41:22,347 --> 00:41:24,752
Do Sik, what do we do
about our Do Ra?

746
00:41:24,776 --> 00:41:25,892
Mom.

747
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:28,416
She's been living her life
as Kim Ji Young,

748
00:41:28,416 --> 00:41:30,517
but we came out of nowhere
saying she was Park Do Ra.

749
00:41:30,517 --> 00:41:32,797
How could this not have shocked her?

750
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:34,927
I don't know for sure,

751
00:41:34,927 --> 00:41:37,432
but she must need some time
to think.

752
00:41:37,456 --> 00:41:39,497
Of course she can't believe
what's happening.

753
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,337
This is confusing for us as well.

754
00:41:41,896 --> 00:41:43,237
Mom,

755
00:41:43,296 --> 00:41:46,706
let's wait until Do Ra reaches out.

756
00:41:46,907 --> 00:41:47,936
I get it.

757
00:41:47,936 --> 00:41:51,246
That's why I'm waiting for her
to call me.

758
00:41:51,807 --> 00:41:55,206
But waiting like this
is killing me inside.

759
00:41:55,206 --> 00:41:57,916
How could she look this different?

760
00:41:57,916 --> 00:41:59,847
She didn't recognize
her mom or her brother.

761
00:41:59,847 --> 00:42:01,217
Does she have amnesia?

762
00:42:01,217 --> 00:42:04,857
Not knowing what happened to her
is driving me crazy.

763
00:42:04,916 --> 00:42:06,057
Besides,

764
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:08,956
I should bring her home
from that miserable house,

765
00:42:08,956 --> 00:42:11,157
but I can't reach her.

766
00:42:11,157 --> 00:42:12,867
I just said
we should give her some time.

767
00:42:12,867 --> 00:42:14,396
For now, we'll wait.

768
00:42:14,396 --> 00:42:15,896
We found Do Ra.

769
00:42:15,896 --> 00:42:18,036
We know where she is, don't we?

770
00:42:21,307 --> 00:42:24,947
All right, fine.
I'll wait one more day.

771
00:42:31,617 --> 00:42:33,927
Mom, I'm going out for a second.

772
00:42:34,387 --> 00:42:35,627
Where to?

773
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:38,096
To run some errands...

774
00:42:38,916 --> 00:42:41,002
and to find out more
about Kim Ji Young.

775
00:42:41,026 --> 00:42:42,327
Where?

776
00:42:42,327 --> 00:42:43,866
I'll find a way.

777
00:42:44,356 --> 00:42:45,666
What the...

778
00:42:46,927 --> 00:42:48,137
Unbelievable.

779
00:42:52,767 --> 00:42:55,377
I thought winning
the screenwriter contest...

780
00:42:55,836 --> 00:42:58,076
would have me on track
to reaching stardom.

781
00:42:58,506 --> 00:43:00,947
But my work keeps getting rejected.

782
00:43:02,347 --> 00:43:04,657
It's not as easy as it seems.

783
00:43:06,247 --> 00:43:09,297
I was miserable
thinking that I had no future.

784
00:43:12,057 --> 00:43:15,666
But seeing you
has me breathing again.

785
00:43:16,396 --> 00:43:17,536
I'm glad.

786
00:43:18,427 --> 00:43:19,567
So...

787
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:21,367
By the way,

788
00:43:21,367 --> 00:43:25,036
I heard the tenant at your house
is an actor.

789
00:43:25,666 --> 00:43:27,346
Oh, Ms. Kim?

790
00:43:28,936 --> 00:43:31,947
Why are you asking about her?

791
00:43:35,677 --> 00:43:38,217
I met her recently
at the convenience store,

792
00:43:38,217 --> 00:43:40,956
and she seemed pure
and kind-hearted.

793
00:43:42,217 --> 00:43:43,427
I see.

794
00:43:44,186 --> 00:43:46,067
Right? She seems that way, right?

795
00:43:46,726 --> 00:43:49,726
That's why I used to be fond of her.

796
00:43:49,726 --> 00:43:52,443
However, it turned out to be an act.

797
00:43:52,467 --> 00:43:54,567
What do you mean it was an act?

798
00:43:55,497 --> 00:43:59,036
Pil Seung and Ji Young are dating,

799
00:43:59,106 --> 00:44:01,976
and my family's completely
against their relationship.

800
00:44:02,436 --> 00:44:04,416
Anyway, during all that,

801
00:44:04,637 --> 00:44:07,407
she seduced a man
who had a woman to marry...

802
00:44:07,407 --> 00:44:09,286
which caused a whole mess of things.

803
00:44:09,376 --> 00:44:12,686
Are you saying your tenant
dated two men at once?

804
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:15,416
That's right. Recently,

805
00:44:15,416 --> 00:44:17,686
the other guy's mom
barged into our house...

806
00:44:17,686 --> 00:44:20,326
and grabbed Ji Young by the hair.

807
00:44:20,657 --> 00:44:23,657
Last night,
the guy came by totally wasted...

808
00:44:23,657 --> 00:44:26,467
yelling at the top of his lungs
telling her to come out.

809
00:44:28,267 --> 00:44:30,507
Our family's disgusted by it,

810
00:44:31,497 --> 00:44:34,576
and we're trying to think of a way
to kick her out.

811
00:44:35,137 --> 00:44:36,137
Is that true?

812
00:44:36,137 --> 00:44:37,516
Absolutely.

813
00:44:37,976 --> 00:44:40,976
She looks so pure and innocent,

814
00:44:40,976 --> 00:44:43,186
but she actually dated
two men at once.

815
00:44:43,376 --> 00:44:46,046
We've been referring to her
as a gold-digger.

816
00:44:46,046 --> 00:44:48,316
- Myung Dong.
- Yes?

817
00:44:48,316 --> 00:44:51,357
How could you talk about someone
in such a spiteful manner?

818
00:44:52,287 --> 00:44:53,427
Is this how you are?

819
00:44:53,427 --> 00:44:55,797
I couldn't be more
disappointed in you today.

820
00:44:56,697 --> 00:44:58,567
- I'll get going first.
- But...

821
00:45:03,197 --> 00:45:04,436
What's with him?

822
00:45:04,867 --> 00:45:06,706
What did I do that was so wrong?

823
00:45:07,566 --> 00:45:08,706
What...

824
00:45:08,907 --> 00:45:12,146
Is it because
I spoke ill about Ji Young?

825
00:45:12,706 --> 00:45:16,016
Who is she to him anyway?

826
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:21,987
What?

827
00:45:21,987 --> 00:45:25,017
Do Ra and Pil Seung are dating?

828
00:45:25,017 --> 00:45:26,387
That's what I said.

829
00:45:26,387 --> 00:45:28,327
Because of that,
his family hates her.

830
00:45:28,327 --> 00:45:29,967
Our poor Do Ra.

831
00:45:30,157 --> 00:45:31,496
My goodness.

832
00:45:31,726 --> 00:45:34,467
How did she get together
with Pil Seung again?

833
00:45:34,927 --> 00:45:37,836
Could he have brought her
to his house...

834
00:45:37,836 --> 00:45:39,777
knowing that she's Do Ra?

835
00:45:39,867 --> 00:45:41,646
If that's true...

836
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:44,717
Gosh, that's sick.
What is he scheming?

837
00:45:45,137 --> 00:45:47,407
I can't stand this.
We'll bring her with us.

838
00:45:47,407 --> 00:45:49,876
How dare they mistreat her?

839
00:45:49,876 --> 00:45:51,316
- Let's go.
- Sure.

840
00:45:51,316 --> 00:45:52,887
Let's go and bring Do Ra home.

841
00:45:52,887 --> 00:45:54,056
That's right.

842
00:45:55,887 --> 00:45:59,326
(Chairman Gong Jin Taek)

843
00:46:16,537 --> 00:46:17,817
Why are you here?

844
00:46:19,037 --> 00:46:21,217
Jin Taek, I'm sorry.

845
00:46:22,276 --> 00:46:24,956
I was drunk yesterday
and made a huge mistake.

846
00:46:26,987 --> 00:46:29,956
I don't care about
whom you choose to date.

847
00:46:30,686 --> 00:46:33,467
But going back and forth
between two ladies?

848
00:46:33,787 --> 00:46:35,226
What is that?

849
00:46:36,296 --> 00:46:37,557
If you like the girl
from the countryside,

850
00:46:37,557 --> 00:46:40,436
end it with Tae Hee
and date her instead.

851
00:46:40,997 --> 00:46:42,026
If you want to be with Tae Hee,

852
00:46:42,026 --> 00:46:44,576
end things with the other girl
once and for all.

853
00:46:45,396 --> 00:46:47,047
You couldn't
make up your mind though,

854
00:46:48,137 --> 00:46:51,677
and played both ladies.
How was that appropriate?

855
00:46:53,606 --> 00:46:55,047
I'm sorry, Jin Taek.

856
00:46:55,706 --> 00:46:57,217
This will never happen again.

857
00:46:57,717 --> 00:47:00,087
I've come to my senses now.

858
00:47:02,916 --> 00:47:04,557
If you keep acting this way,

859
00:47:04,557 --> 00:47:07,627
it will be your mother
who is humiliated.

860
00:47:13,066 --> 00:47:14,407
You are dismissed.

861
00:47:17,666 --> 00:47:18,806
Sure.

862
00:47:32,787 --> 00:47:35,117
Goodness, I love the smell.

863
00:47:35,117 --> 00:47:37,686
The smell of oil
has filled the house,

864
00:47:37,686 --> 00:47:39,557
and it smells like a feast.

865
00:47:39,557 --> 00:47:41,427
Mother, can you flip
the jeon for me?

866
00:47:41,427 --> 00:47:43,197
Yes, sure thing.

867
00:47:43,626 --> 00:47:46,467
Pil Seung will arrive
in the afternoon, won't he?

868
00:47:46,467 --> 00:47:47,666
Yes.

869
00:47:47,827 --> 00:47:49,597
He received a prestigious award,

870
00:47:49,597 --> 00:47:51,536
and it felt wrong not to celebrate.

871
00:47:52,537 --> 00:47:55,537
While you're at it,
make kimchi jjigae too.

872
00:47:55,537 --> 00:47:57,737
The food he had there
must have been oily and cheesy.

873
00:47:57,737 --> 00:48:00,447
Yes, I'll do that.

874
00:48:01,976 --> 00:48:04,217
Hello. Is anyone in?

875
00:48:05,717 --> 00:48:06,956
Who's that?

876
00:48:07,617 --> 00:48:10,826
- Goodness.
- Gosh. What's all this?

877
00:48:11,117 --> 00:48:13,666
What is all this?

878
00:48:13,756 --> 00:48:15,396
It's from the chairman.

879
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:18,557
- Okay, thanks.
- Thank you.

880
00:48:18,557 --> 00:48:19,806
Goodbye.

881
00:48:20,367 --> 00:48:21,536
Bye.

882
00:48:21,997 --> 00:48:23,206
Hey.

883
00:48:23,867 --> 00:48:26,613
The chairman sent so many things.

884
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:29,976
- Yes. There's so much.
- My word.

885
00:48:30,577 --> 00:48:31,877
Hang on.

886
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:33,987
Who is it?

887
00:48:34,606 --> 00:48:36,047
I don't know this number.

888
00:48:36,476 --> 00:48:37,657
Hello?

889
00:48:38,347 --> 00:48:41,027
Hello, this is Gong Jin Taek.

890
00:48:41,747 --> 00:48:45,127
Oh, hello, Chairman. How are you?

891
00:48:45,157 --> 00:48:48,596
Did you get the items
I told my driver to deliver?

892
00:48:48,827 --> 00:48:50,796
Yes, he just dropped them off.

893
00:48:50,796 --> 00:48:54,066
Why did you send over so much?

894
00:48:54,066 --> 00:48:57,607
Don't say that.
I wish I could give you much more.

895
00:48:57,867 --> 00:49:00,107
I owe you so much and I think...

896
00:49:00,267 --> 00:49:02,916
my family has been a nuisance too.

897
00:49:03,077 --> 00:49:06,223
I apologize for that
and for what my brother did.

898
00:49:06,247 --> 00:49:09,493
Please don't say that.
We don't mind at all.

899
00:49:09,517 --> 00:49:11,916
Thank you for being
so understanding.

900
00:49:11,916 --> 00:49:13,816
I hope to talk to you again.

901
00:49:13,816 --> 00:49:17,086
Yes, sure, Chairman. Goodbye.

902
00:49:17,086 --> 00:49:19,133
Was that Chairman Gong?

903
00:49:19,157 --> 00:49:21,127
Why did he send all this?

904
00:49:21,987 --> 00:49:25,073
I guess he felt bad
about what his brother did.

905
00:49:25,097 --> 00:49:27,702
He would and should.

906
00:49:27,726 --> 00:49:30,377
He must've been awfully embarrassed.

907
00:49:31,066 --> 00:49:33,713
Do you see how thoughtful he is?

908
00:49:33,737 --> 00:49:36,916
He sent a skincare set
for each person.

909
00:49:37,037 --> 00:49:39,746
He's so generous.
Is this what chairmen are like?

910
00:49:40,146 --> 00:49:42,587
- I guess so?
- Just look.

911
00:49:42,876 --> 00:49:44,416
- I'm going out.
- Okay.

912
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:46,016
- See you later.
- Bye.

913
00:49:47,686 --> 00:49:49,056
- Sun Young.
- Yes?

914
00:49:50,086 --> 00:49:52,857
Pil Seung will be home
in a few hours.

915
00:49:53,026 --> 00:49:54,896
What should we do about our tenant?

916
00:49:55,026 --> 00:49:57,137
Why is she still here?

917
00:49:57,827 --> 00:50:00,306
I don't know. What should we do?

918
00:50:01,796 --> 00:50:03,637
I can't drag her out with force.

919
00:50:04,066 --> 00:50:06,346
It's so frustrating.

920
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:27,697
Who is it?

921
00:50:36,436 --> 00:50:37,576
Miss.

922
00:50:38,396 --> 00:50:42,047
You said you'd move away,
so why are you still here?

923
00:50:42,336 --> 00:50:46,582
Are you planning to sit around
until Pil Seung comes back?

924
00:50:46,606 --> 00:50:49,116
So you can hide behind his back?

925
00:50:49,677 --> 00:50:54,257
No, it's not that.
I had something to deal with.

926
00:50:54,747 --> 00:50:56,627
As if you did.

927
00:50:57,157 --> 00:51:00,026
My daughter-in-law
wired you the security deposit.

928
00:51:00,026 --> 00:51:01,527
Why are you still here?

929
00:51:01,827 --> 00:51:03,197
Listen up.

930
00:51:03,597 --> 00:51:05,772
You can cling all you want,

931
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:08,097
but we can't and won't accept you.

932
00:51:08,097 --> 00:51:09,796
And since we're on the topic,

933
00:51:09,796 --> 00:51:12,666
you shouldn't do this to us
if you have a conscience.

934
00:51:12,666 --> 00:51:14,982
We caught you with another guy,

935
00:51:15,006 --> 00:51:16,936
and we even had to witness...

936
00:51:16,936 --> 00:51:19,947
his mom pull your hair out
when she came over.

937
00:51:20,106 --> 00:51:24,286
How could you even audition to be
in Pil Seung's drama after that?

938
00:51:24,416 --> 00:51:28,157
If I were you, I couldn't do that
even if I were told to.

939
00:51:28,617 --> 00:51:32,527
Ms. So. There was nothing
between me and Mr. Gong, I swear.

940
00:51:32,586 --> 00:51:34,596
I'm well and truly blameless.

941
00:51:34,626 --> 00:51:37,467
I can vow to the heavens
I did nothing shameful.

942
00:51:37,497 --> 00:51:41,137
What? Look at you.
You're so shameless.

943
00:51:41,396 --> 00:51:43,137
There was nothing between you two?

944
00:51:43,197 --> 00:51:45,497
If nothing happened between you two,

945
00:51:45,497 --> 00:51:48,836
why did he come here drunk
in the middle of the night,

946
00:51:48,836 --> 00:51:50,836
sprawl out in our garden,
call your name,

947
00:51:50,836 --> 00:51:53,487
and demand you take responsibility?

948
00:51:54,407 --> 00:51:55,686
He did that?

949
00:51:55,976 --> 00:51:58,916
Yes! There was
a huge fuss last night.

950
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:04,456
You got caught and everyone knows,
so it's for the better now.

951
00:52:05,117 --> 00:52:07,856
Mr. Gong loves you to death,

952
00:52:07,856 --> 00:52:09,903
so date and marry him instead.

953
00:52:09,927 --> 00:52:12,073
His family
is much better off than ours.

954
00:52:12,097 --> 00:52:14,907
He can give you
a good life and future.

955
00:52:15,467 --> 00:52:18,867
Stop acting like a rag
and going between men.

956
00:52:18,867 --> 00:52:20,576
Just go away!

957
00:52:20,907 --> 00:52:22,113
Ms. So.

958
00:52:22,137 --> 00:52:25,677
I said I never dated him.
Why won't you believe me?

959
00:52:25,776 --> 00:52:27,286
You're so cruel.

960
00:52:27,976 --> 00:52:30,852
Director Ko might be
your precious grandson,

961
00:52:30,876 --> 00:52:34,726
but I'm my grandma's
precious granddaughter too.

962
00:52:35,117 --> 00:52:39,157
She would weep her heart out
if she heard how you treated me.

963
00:52:39,287 --> 00:52:41,067
So move out!

964
00:52:41,126 --> 00:52:42,896
If you'd moved out sooner,

965
00:52:42,927 --> 00:52:46,542
neither of us would have to
go through all this!

966
00:52:46,566 --> 00:52:48,473
Okay. I'll move out.

967
00:52:48,497 --> 00:52:50,272
I will, okay?

968
00:52:50,296 --> 00:52:51,836
Don't just say so!

969
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:54,576
Get lost
before Pil Seung comes home!

970
00:52:55,006 --> 00:52:57,637
There's no need to come over
to say goodbye.

971
00:52:57,637 --> 00:52:59,677
None of us want to see you,

972
00:52:59,677 --> 00:53:01,347
so just get out of here.

973
00:53:01,347 --> 00:53:03,617
Okay, I'll leave right away.

974
00:53:03,617 --> 00:53:05,857
- Let go of me.
- Go away.

975
00:53:18,697 --> 00:53:21,036
My goodness.

976
00:53:21,166 --> 00:53:23,166
What a troubled mess she is.

977
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:25,097
She acts like she's all naive,

978
00:53:25,097 --> 00:53:28,576
but she's not
and she has a temper too.

979
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:31,516
She screamed right back in my face.

980
00:53:31,637 --> 00:53:35,247
She's so ignorant and crass.
Good riddance.

981
00:53:35,247 --> 00:53:36,677
- Darn her.
- Mother.

982
00:53:36,677 --> 00:53:39,056
Did you go over to see Ji Young?

983
00:53:39,247 --> 00:53:41,956
Yes. I told her to leave
before Pil Seung...

984
00:53:42,017 --> 00:53:45,326
came home since
she'd decided to move out.

985
00:53:45,586 --> 00:53:47,996
She said she'd leave right away.

986
00:53:48,387 --> 00:53:49,527
Did she really?

987
00:53:58,237 --> 00:53:59,377
Do Ra.

988
00:54:01,106 --> 00:54:02,246
Why are you crying?

989
00:54:02,637 --> 00:54:04,206
I heard you were
being bullied by this family.

990
00:54:04,206 --> 00:54:05,877
Did they bully you again?

991
00:54:08,706 --> 00:54:10,146
I'll turn their place upside-down...

992
00:54:10,146 --> 00:54:12,456
Mom, relax.
That's not what's important.

993
00:54:13,646 --> 00:54:17,117
Do Ra. Come home with Mom.

994
00:54:17,117 --> 00:54:18,496
Come with me.

995
00:54:18,987 --> 00:54:20,166
Do Ra.

996
00:54:20,427 --> 00:54:23,396
I don't know
how you ended up like this,

997
00:54:24,057 --> 00:54:25,626
but you're my daughter
and I'm your mom.

998
00:54:25,626 --> 00:54:28,107
So let's live together now.

999
00:54:28,526 --> 00:54:32,137
Why should we live apart
when you're alive and you're back?

1000
00:54:32,497 --> 00:54:34,877
I can't let you live alone, Do Ra.

1001
00:54:36,677 --> 00:54:38,146
Lady.

1002
00:54:40,347 --> 00:54:44,217
Are you really my mom?

1003
00:54:45,146 --> 00:54:48,686
Yes. I'm your mom.

1004
00:54:48,717 --> 00:54:50,487
We tested our DNA.

1005
00:54:50,487 --> 00:54:52,657
You saw the results for yourself.

1006
00:54:53,126 --> 00:54:55,627
Do Ra. You are my sister.

1007
00:54:55,956 --> 00:54:58,166
I recognized you when we first met.

1008
00:54:58,226 --> 00:55:00,936
Why should you go through this
when you have us both?

1009
00:55:01,126 --> 00:55:02,436
Let's go home.

1010
00:55:02,997 --> 00:55:06,542
I'll protect you.
I'll be by your side.

1011
00:55:06,566 --> 00:55:08,076
Let's go.

1012
00:55:10,137 --> 00:55:11,317
Come along.

1013
00:55:17,646 --> 00:55:20,127
Come in. This is where we live.

1014
00:55:20,686 --> 00:55:21,887
Come inside.

1015
00:55:25,157 --> 00:55:26,596
Sit down, Do Ra.

1016
00:55:29,026 --> 00:55:33,067
Is this where you two live?

1017
00:55:33,827 --> 00:55:35,697
It's not that grand, is it?

1018
00:55:35,697 --> 00:55:37,476
Sorry. I'm not well-off.

1019
00:55:39,396 --> 00:55:43,007
We lost everything after you died.

1020
00:55:43,836 --> 00:55:45,307
You don't remember,

1021
00:55:45,307 --> 00:55:47,307
but we used to live in
a 330m² apartment...

1022
00:55:47,307 --> 00:55:49,346
in Cheongdam-dong.

1023
00:55:53,816 --> 00:55:55,056
I'm sorry, Do Ra.

1024
00:55:56,487 --> 00:55:58,896
I wronged you. Forgive me.

1025
00:56:03,226 --> 00:56:04,536
I wanted to...

1026
00:56:05,327 --> 00:56:08,366
increase the money you made
by investing it.

1027
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:10,637
But I got conned.

1028
00:56:11,997 --> 00:56:15,166
I felt so bad, I tried to
make up for it in secret...

1029
00:56:15,166 --> 00:56:17,047
and met some horrid people.

1030
00:56:18,106 --> 00:56:19,616
I went to a gambling den,

1031
00:56:20,276 --> 00:56:23,447
got addicted to gambling,
took out private loans,

1032
00:56:23,447 --> 00:56:26,627
and lost everything we had.

1033
00:56:27,186 --> 00:56:30,027
It's my fault we lost everything.

1034
00:56:31,557 --> 00:56:35,387
Do Ra. After you died,
I went to that exact spot...

1035
00:56:35,387 --> 00:56:38,567
so many times
to follow you to the afterlife.

1036
00:56:40,066 --> 00:56:42,726
But I just couldn't leave
Do Sik and Do Jun behind.

1037
00:56:42,726 --> 00:56:44,697
What would happen
if I were to die too?

1038
00:56:44,697 --> 00:56:48,146
I went on living
because I had no other choice.

1039
00:56:49,336 --> 00:56:50,576
Do Ra.

1040
00:56:51,436 --> 00:56:53,076
I wronged you in so many ways.

1041
00:56:54,847 --> 00:56:57,016
I'll make it up to you
for the rest of my life.

1042
00:56:58,816 --> 00:57:02,257
Do Ra. Look at the photo
behind you. That's you.

1043
00:57:05,387 --> 00:57:09,096
We thought of you
every day since you died.

1044
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:11,936
You were always on our minds.

1045
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:22,547
Do Ra.

1046
00:57:23,537 --> 00:57:26,616
I'm glad you left that home.

1047
00:57:26,747 --> 00:57:28,447
You can't live with them.

1048
00:57:28,447 --> 00:57:29,817
They're our sworn enemies.

1049
00:57:30,976 --> 00:57:34,987
How did you end up
living with our enemies?

1050
00:57:35,617 --> 00:57:38,226
No. It's obvious what happened.

1051
00:57:38,887 --> 00:57:40,996
That fool Pil Seung
brought you there, didn't he?

1052
00:57:41,287 --> 00:57:42,363
The scumbag.

1053
00:57:42,387 --> 00:57:46,067
He's the jerk who ruined your life.

1054
00:57:46,767 --> 00:57:48,337
What do you mean?

1055
00:57:48,697 --> 00:57:50,637
Why is Director Ko a jerk?

1056
00:57:51,267 --> 00:57:54,137
You died because of him.

1057
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,506
If you hadn't met him,
you wouldn't have had to die,

1058
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:59,113
and we wouldn't have
lost everything.

1059
00:57:59,137 --> 00:58:01,947
What on earth did Director Ko do?

1060
00:58:04,217 --> 00:58:05,657
Listen, Do Ra.

1061
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:08,257
You had someone else
to get married to.

1062
00:58:09,086 --> 00:58:11,157
But that jerk, Ko Pil Seung
came between you two.

1063
00:58:11,157 --> 00:58:12,787
So your engagement was called off
and your commercials were canceled.

1064
00:58:12,787 --> 00:58:15,526
That's how our family
ended up going broke.

1065
00:58:15,526 --> 00:58:18,137
It's all because of the jerk,
Ko Pil Seung.

1066
00:58:18,726 --> 00:58:22,166
I read some articles
about Park Do Ra.

1067
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:23,777
They say she died...

1068
00:58:24,967 --> 00:58:27,377
because of the gambling debt
and sponsorship.

1069
00:58:28,006 --> 00:58:30,506
Come on. That's just
what the articles say.

1070
00:58:30,506 --> 00:58:32,006
People don't know anything.

1071
00:58:32,006 --> 00:58:33,887
We're the ones
who know the whole story.

1072
00:58:34,276 --> 00:58:37,146
The gambling debt? You could've
paid it off if you worked hard.

1073
00:58:37,146 --> 00:58:39,757
But Ko Pil Seung was
standing in your way.

1074
00:58:40,046 --> 00:58:41,747
If it weren't for him,
you would've got married...

1075
00:58:41,747 --> 00:58:43,987
and lived well off as a top star.

1076
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:46,866
You would've lived high on the hog.

1077
00:58:47,456 --> 00:58:48,627
That can't be true.

1078
00:58:48,756 --> 00:58:50,296
I knew you'd be like this.

1079
00:58:50,296 --> 00:58:53,666
You've been brainwashed
by that brat, Ko Pil Seung.

1080
00:58:54,967 --> 00:58:57,877
Do Ra, you have to listen to me.

1081
00:58:58,436 --> 00:59:01,646
I'm sure Ko Pil Seung knew
you were Park Do Ra.

1082
00:59:02,166 --> 00:59:05,677
He got you in their extra room
to keep you away from me.

1083
00:59:05,677 --> 00:59:07,606
Even when we were pulling
each other's hair in a fight,

1084
00:59:07,606 --> 00:59:10,476
Ko Pil Seung, that jerk,
stood by without doing anything.

1085
00:59:10,476 --> 00:59:12,146
That's how horrible he is.

1086
00:59:12,146 --> 00:59:15,556
He's a scumbag
who drove a wedge between us.

1087
00:59:16,657 --> 00:59:19,927
No. Director Ko is
not that kind of person.

1088
00:59:20,856 --> 00:59:22,297
My goodness.

1089
00:59:22,956 --> 00:59:26,467
You just don't know
anything about him.

1090
00:59:27,066 --> 00:59:28,436
All right then.

1091
00:59:29,296 --> 00:59:30,896
You should go see it for yourself.

1092
00:59:30,896 --> 00:59:32,173
Whether he knew...

1093
00:59:32,197 --> 00:59:35,306
you were Park Do Ra or not.

1094
00:59:36,137 --> 00:59:38,746
No. I don't think he knew.

1095
00:59:38,807 --> 00:59:41,082
If he knew,
why would he come between us?

1096
00:59:41,106 --> 00:59:43,646
Why would he sit back
and just watch us fight...

1097
00:59:43,646 --> 00:59:47,027
when he knew we were
a mother and a daughter?

1098
00:59:48,086 --> 00:59:51,326
That's the last thing
Director Ko would do.

1099
01:00:00,267 --> 01:00:01,666
Oh, dear.

1100
01:00:07,506 --> 01:00:08,666
Thank you.

1101
01:00:08,666 --> 01:00:11,177
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

1102
01:00:11,606 --> 01:00:13,706
- Thank you.
- Pil Seung.

1103
01:00:13,706 --> 01:00:15,077
My stomach is feeling a bit heavy.

1104
01:00:15,077 --> 01:00:16,947
Why don't we go drink soju
with some kimchi jjigae?

1105
01:00:16,947 --> 01:00:18,376
- That sounds nice.
- I'd love that.

1106
01:00:18,376 --> 01:00:20,287
Bong Soo, Mr. Jang, and Ms. Kim.
I'm sorry,

1107
01:00:20,287 --> 01:00:22,316
but I have to hurry home.

1108
01:00:22,316 --> 01:00:24,356
I'll take a rain check
on the soju and kimchi jjigae.

1109
01:00:24,356 --> 01:00:25,916
Thank you all for your hard work.

1110
01:00:25,916 --> 01:00:28,467
- Hey.
- What... But...

1111
01:00:28,526 --> 01:00:30,697
What was that? What a let-down.

1112
01:00:30,697 --> 01:00:32,956
Does he have a wife
we don't know about at home or what?

1113
01:00:32,956 --> 01:00:34,827
That just makes me sad and lonely.

1114
01:00:34,827 --> 01:00:37,137
I know. Does he have
a jar of honey at home or what?

1115
01:00:37,896 --> 01:00:40,907
Mr. Jang and Ms. Kim, we should go
and have some soju without him.

1116
01:00:40,907 --> 01:00:41,907
It's on me.

1117
01:00:41,907 --> 01:00:43,267
- That sounds great.
- Sure.

1118
01:00:43,267 --> 01:00:45,237
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1119
01:00:45,237 --> 01:00:46,987
Is there any good place
in this neighborhood?

1120
01:00:49,247 --> 01:00:52,587
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

1121
01:00:53,487 --> 01:00:55,226
Why can't I get
in touch with Ji Young?

1122
01:00:55,847 --> 01:00:57,627
Since yesterday,
she hasn't been answering my texts.

1123
01:00:58,987 --> 01:01:00,666
Could something have happened?

1124
01:01:04,626 --> 01:01:05,797
Ji Young.

1125
01:01:07,597 --> 01:01:08,737
Ji Young.

1126
01:01:10,796 --> 01:01:11,976
What?

1127
01:01:13,666 --> 01:01:14,846
Ji Young.

1128
01:01:19,307 --> 01:01:20,516
What?

1129
01:01:21,706 --> 01:01:22,987
What happened?

1130
01:01:24,747 --> 01:01:25,987
Why is it vacant?

1131
01:01:29,747 --> 01:01:31,697
Did she perhaps move out?

1132
01:01:39,126 --> 01:01:42,097
If Pil Seung finds out
that Ji Young has moved out,

1133
01:01:42,097 --> 01:01:43,607
he will get furious.

1134
01:01:44,066 --> 01:01:46,613
Don't you think we should tell him
the truth once he gets home?

1135
01:01:46,637 --> 01:01:48,267
We can tell him after we eat.

1136
01:01:48,267 --> 01:01:50,106
If we tell him before a meal,

1137
01:01:50,106 --> 01:01:51,646
he will refuse to eat.

1138
01:01:55,776 --> 01:01:57,276
Why did you kick her out?

1139
01:01:57,276 --> 01:01:58,717
Even if you wanted her to leave,

1140
01:01:58,717 --> 01:02:01,027
you should've waited
until Pil Seung came back.

1141
01:02:02,787 --> 01:02:03,787
He's here.

1142
01:02:03,787 --> 01:02:05,416
- Mom. Grandma.
- Pil Seung, you're home.

1143
01:02:05,416 --> 01:02:07,126
Why is Ji Young's room vacant?

1144
01:02:07,126 --> 01:02:08,263
What?

1145
01:02:08,287 --> 01:02:09,666
Don't tell me...

1146
01:02:10,497 --> 01:02:12,467
you kicked her out.

1147
01:02:12,927 --> 01:02:14,597
We didn't kick her out.

1148
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:16,837
She just moved out herself
because she felt guilty.

1149
01:02:17,267 --> 01:02:18,607
Feel guilty for what?

1150
01:02:19,396 --> 01:02:21,076
Did you say something to her again?

1151
01:02:22,436 --> 01:02:25,447
It's not like I forced her
to move out or something.

1152
01:02:26,237 --> 01:02:27,947
A few days ago,

1153
01:02:27,947 --> 01:02:30,916
Mr. Gong showed up drunk again.

1154
01:02:30,916 --> 01:02:33,247
And he kept screaming
and making a fuss...

1155
01:02:33,247 --> 01:02:36,447
saying that tenant lady
should take care of him.

1156
01:02:36,447 --> 01:02:40,257
My goodness. I'm so embarrassed
to see people in the neighborhood.

1157
01:02:40,287 --> 01:02:42,456
I just can't hold my head up.

1158
01:02:42,456 --> 01:02:44,026
Mr. Gong showed up again?

1159
01:02:44,026 --> 01:02:45,597
Yes, he did.

1160
01:02:45,597 --> 01:02:47,767
Chairman Gong,
I mean, Ma Ri's dad...

1161
01:02:47,767 --> 01:02:50,607
came all the way here
and took him home.

1162
01:02:51,537 --> 01:02:55,476
So I gave her a piece of advice.

1163
01:02:56,737 --> 01:02:58,577
When there's a fuss
going on like this,

1164
01:02:58,577 --> 01:03:01,887
I should say something
as an elder in the family.

1165
01:03:02,247 --> 01:03:03,387
Grandmother!

1166
01:03:04,646 --> 01:03:07,686
Ko Pil Seung, don't you think
you're being unreasonable?

1167
01:03:07,747 --> 01:03:09,217
You were coming home today,

1168
01:03:09,217 --> 01:03:11,517
so we made jeon, japchae,
galbi jjim, and everything for you.

1169
01:03:11,517 --> 01:03:14,456
We've been working hard to cook
your favorite dishes since morning.

1170
01:03:14,456 --> 01:03:16,927
But you only care
about Ji Young having moved out?

1171
01:03:16,927 --> 01:03:18,567
Don't you care about us at all?

1172
01:03:18,626 --> 01:03:20,827
She's right, Pil Seung.
Let's have a seat first.

1173
01:03:20,827 --> 01:03:23,166
We can talk about it after we eat.

1174
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:25,536
Dad, when did Ji Young move out?

1175
01:03:29,867 --> 01:03:31,076
Director Ko.

1176
01:03:31,876 --> 01:03:33,377
Let's meet up.

1177
01:03:35,276 --> 01:03:37,317
- My gosh.
- Hey, Pil Seung.

1178
01:03:38,947 --> 01:03:40,286
What's going on?

1179
01:03:43,217 --> 01:03:46,117
Oh, dear. That crazy fool.

1180
01:03:46,117 --> 01:03:47,327
Unbelievable.

1181
01:03:47,327 --> 01:03:50,366
How could he lose his mind
like that because of some girl?

1182
01:03:51,097 --> 01:03:52,496
My gosh.

1183
01:03:57,497 --> 01:03:58,637
Ji Young.

1184
01:04:02,166 --> 01:04:04,817
What happened?
Why didn't you answer my calls?

1185
01:04:05,106 --> 01:04:06,447
Did something happen?

1186
01:04:06,907 --> 01:04:09,447
Why did you move out
without telling me?

1187
01:04:09,947 --> 01:04:11,817
Is this about
my mom and grandmother?

1188
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:16,186
Director Ko.

1189
01:04:16,956 --> 01:04:20,056
There's something I need to ask you.

1190
01:04:24,396 --> 01:04:26,337
What is it? Ask anything.

1191
01:04:27,097 --> 01:04:28,237
Director Ko.

1192
01:04:28,997 --> 01:04:31,107
Am I Park Do Ra?

1193
01:04:40,907 --> 01:04:42,047
What?

1194
01:04:44,217 --> 01:04:48,087
Did you know that I was Park Do Ra?

1195
01:04:49,217 --> 01:04:50,357
Ji...

1196
01:04:54,526 --> 01:04:55,697
Ji Young.

1197
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:06,337
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1198
01:05:38,537 --> 01:05:40,836
What? What is Kim Ji Young doing
at GOGO Entertainment?

1199
01:05:40,836 --> 01:05:42,867
Did he get her a job here?

1200
01:05:42,867 --> 01:05:45,082
What is that jerk,
Ko Pil Seung, up to?

1201
01:05:45,106 --> 01:05:46,106
This is unbelievable.

1202
01:05:46,106 --> 01:05:49,307
The investor found out
about you and Kim Ji Young...

1203
01:05:49,307 --> 01:05:50,577
so he wants to withdraw
the investment.

1204
01:05:50,577 --> 01:05:52,447
We need to replace her with someone.

1205
01:05:52,447 --> 01:05:54,686
Ji Young and I are broken up.

1206
01:05:54,686 --> 01:05:55,916
Forget about that jerk.

1207
01:05:55,916 --> 01:05:58,987
You should just trust me
and move on.

1208
01:05:58,987 --> 01:06:00,726
Was it a mistake...

1209
01:06:00,726 --> 01:06:02,356
that I wanted Do Ra
to live as Kim Ji Young?

1210
01:06:02,356 --> 01:06:03,896
Was I trying to wrap her life...

1211
01:06:03,896 --> 01:06:05,726
around my finger?

1212
01:06:05,726 --> 01:06:08,066
I will never forgive you,
Director Ko.

1213
01:06:08,066 --> 01:06:09,197
Don't call me.

1214
01:06:09,197 --> 01:06:10,737
It's over for us.

1215
01:06:11,767 --> 01:06:14,206
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
