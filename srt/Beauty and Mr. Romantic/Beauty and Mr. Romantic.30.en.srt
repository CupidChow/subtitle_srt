00:00:09,174 --> 00:00:11,073
(Episode 30)

3
00:00:11,873 --> 00:00:14,644
Sun Young, what are you doing here
at this hour?

4
00:00:16,143 --> 00:00:17,313
You witch.

5
00:00:23,614 --> 00:00:25,953
- Sun Young.
- You evil witch!

6
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:29,894
You abandoned Pil Seung
at our doorstep.

7
00:00:31,223 --> 00:00:33,293
You had me raise him instead...

8
00:00:33,763 --> 00:00:35,664
and have been lying to me
ever since.

9
00:00:39,034 --> 00:00:41,803
That's why you approached me
saying we should be friends.

10
00:00:42,674 --> 00:00:45,104
It was to stay in my life
as my friend...

11
00:00:45,104 --> 00:00:47,174
so that you could
see Pil Seung grow up.

12
00:00:48,244 --> 00:00:49,343
How could you?

13
00:00:50,144 --> 00:00:52,443
How could you do this?

14
00:00:53,043 --> 00:00:54,614
And you call yourself human?

15
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:57,053
How can you even live with yourself?

16
00:00:59,653 --> 00:01:03,123
He was only a tiny baby.

17
00:01:03,954 --> 00:01:07,093
You abandoned
that poor baby yourself.

18
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:09,263
And with those dirty hands,

19
00:01:09,263 --> 00:01:12,364
you doted on my son
while patting him, hugging him,

20
00:01:13,103 --> 00:01:15,273
bathing him,
and carrying him around.

21
00:01:15,973 --> 00:01:17,034
With...

22
00:01:17,303 --> 00:01:19,644
You shoved
this despicable face of yours...

23
00:01:19,904 --> 00:01:21,814
at him,

24
00:01:21,814 --> 00:01:24,174
gave him kisses, and stroked him.

25
00:01:31,454 --> 00:01:35,094
I can't forgive you
for what you did.

26
00:01:36,094 --> 00:01:37,223
Actually,

27
00:01:37,693 --> 00:01:40,064
I'd rather stomp on you to death.

28
00:01:40,723 --> 00:01:43,433
You evil witch.

29
00:01:43,633 --> 00:01:46,433
You dirty hag.

30
00:01:47,303 --> 00:01:49,333
- You evil witch.
- Honey!

31
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,573
- How could you?
- Honey.

32
00:01:51,573 --> 00:01:52,603
Honey, please.

33
00:01:52,603 --> 00:01:54,943
Sun Young, stop.

34
00:01:57,473 --> 00:02:00,583
She's heartless, honey.

35
00:02:01,044 --> 00:02:02,853
She's not human.

36
00:02:02,853 --> 00:02:06,254
You're right.
She's a heartless beast.

37
00:02:06,353 --> 00:02:08,823
So let's go home, okay?

38
00:02:09,493 --> 00:02:12,424
How could you do this to me?

39
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,523
You even had the audacity
to call me your friend!

40
00:02:14,594 --> 00:02:17,033
Sun Young, that's enough.

41
00:02:23,674 --> 00:02:27,243
I can't believe you.

42
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:31,683
Abandoning your own child
is a sick enough crime,

43
00:02:31,683 --> 00:02:33,044
but you had the audacity...

44
00:02:33,044 --> 00:02:35,984
to come into our lives
and do something this crazy!

45
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,153
I have never come across a woman...

46
00:02:38,153 --> 00:02:40,553
as heartless as you before!

47
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,523
All while in the dark,

48
00:02:43,523 --> 00:02:45,394
we accepted the clothes...

49
00:02:45,394 --> 00:02:46,963
and the food you gave us.

50
00:02:47,063 --> 00:02:50,164
On top of that, we gushed over
how grateful we were.

51
00:02:52,403 --> 00:02:54,933
You evil witch!

52
00:02:56,003 --> 00:02:58,243
You should burn in the afterlife!

53
00:03:34,243 --> 00:03:36,414
Okay, let me see.

54
00:03:37,213 --> 00:03:40,384
Goodness.
Did you already kick the blanket?

55
00:03:40,444 --> 00:03:42,683
Was it too stifling?

56
00:03:45,623 --> 00:03:47,683
You're so adorable.

57
00:03:48,924 --> 00:03:50,023
Let's go.

58
00:03:51,894 --> 00:03:53,924
Hey. Sun Young.

59
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,264
I'm so sorry.

60
00:04:04,174 --> 00:04:05,403
That's how much...

61
00:04:07,003 --> 00:04:09,114
I wanted to see Pil Seung.

62
00:04:11,414 --> 00:04:13,514
I knew it was wrong,

63
00:04:14,914 --> 00:04:17,884
but I wanted to do it
to be around him.

64
00:04:21,384 --> 00:04:22,424
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:25,964 --> 00:04:27,024
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:43,114 --> 00:04:45,743
Mom, I need to go to work.

67
00:04:47,044 --> 00:04:49,313
I'll stay with Sun Young.

68
00:04:49,313 --> 00:04:50,854
You can go.

69
00:04:51,453 --> 00:04:54,724
You just opened the business.

70
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:57,553
The owner should be around. Go.

71
00:04:57,553 --> 00:05:00,164
Myung Dong,
help your brother at the restaurant.

72
00:05:00,693 --> 00:05:01,734
Okay.

73
00:05:03,693 --> 00:05:04,734
Honey.

74
00:05:05,464 --> 00:05:08,974
Whatever people say,
Pil Seung is our son.

75
00:05:08,974 --> 00:05:12,373
For his sake,
you can't lose control, okay?

76
00:05:14,044 --> 00:05:15,313
I'm off to work.

77
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,114
Mom, stay by her side.

78
00:05:18,214 --> 00:05:19,784
I will. Don't worry.

79
00:05:21,984 --> 00:05:23,053
Goodness.

80
00:05:24,114 --> 00:05:25,183
Oh, Sun Young...

81
00:05:35,164 --> 00:05:36,594
Sun Young.

82
00:05:37,364 --> 00:05:38,404
Sun...

(Hope Psychiatric
and Mental Health Clinic)

84
00:05:49,754 --> 00:05:53,425
It's because you didn't have
enough time to grieve for the dead.

85
00:05:54,184 --> 00:05:57,555
Don't deny or snub
feelings of sadness or regret...

86
00:05:57,994 --> 00:05:59,095
and accept them.

87
00:05:59,665 --> 00:06:01,095
You need the time to do that.

88
00:06:03,295 --> 00:06:06,434
She died not two weeks
or months but two years ago.

89
00:06:07,465 --> 00:06:08,775
And that wasn't enough time?

90
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,644
This can happen when you're left
with a lot of regret...

91
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:12,944
or guilt about the dead.

92
00:06:14,504 --> 00:06:15,744
Guilt?

93

(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

94
00:06:27,584 --> 00:06:30,225
This can happen when you're left
with a lot of regret...

95
00:06:30,394 --> 00:06:31,454
or guilt about the dead.

96
00:06:34,225 --> 00:06:35,764
What a quack.

97
00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:39,105
Guilt? I did something wrong?

98
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:42,934
All I did wrong
was love Do Ra with all my heart.

99
00:06:44,475 --> 00:06:46,545
I didn't do anything wrong to her at all.

100
00:06:47,204 --> 00:06:48,644
Did I tell her to die?

101
00:06:49,374 --> 00:06:51,444
She went and killed herself.

102
00:06:58,725 --> 00:07:00,084
Why did you do it?

103
00:07:01,124 --> 00:07:02,155
Why?

104
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:27,845
Sun Young.

105
00:07:28,954 --> 00:07:32,485
Sun Young. I made some porridge.

106
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,124
Sit up and eat.

107
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:37,454
You'll get really sick
if you don't eat.

108
00:07:37,754 --> 00:07:38,824
Come on.

109
00:07:39,324 --> 00:07:40,365
There you go.

110
00:07:43,035 --> 00:07:44,095
Goodness.

111
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:48,605
You need to eat something...

112
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,074
and get your energy back...

113
00:07:51,074 --> 00:07:53,545
if you want to hate that woman.

114
00:07:55,014 --> 00:07:58,444
You can't hate anyone
if you don't have the energy to.

115
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,545
Here you go.

116
00:08:03,415 --> 00:08:06,925
This is water kimchi broth
and salted spicy squid.

117
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:10,254
You poor thing.

118
00:08:13,595 --> 00:08:15,994
The more I think
about Jang Soo Yeon,

119
00:08:16,394 --> 00:08:18,735
the more I realize
how sneaky she was.

120
00:08:19,434 --> 00:08:22,074
When she scouted Pil Seung
with that great offer,

121
00:08:22,074 --> 00:08:23,735
we were so grateful for it.

122
00:08:24,374 --> 00:08:27,204
But to think that was all planned.

123
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:29,475
To keep Pil Seung close.

124
00:08:30,374 --> 00:08:31,944
I don't believe it.

125
00:08:33,584 --> 00:08:34,584
Hey.

126
00:08:34,985 --> 00:08:36,115
Sun Young.

127
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:37,884
Hey, Sun Young.

128
00:08:38,624 --> 00:08:39,854
What's going on?

129
00:08:40,255 --> 00:08:42,255
Sun Young.

130
00:08:43,795 --> 00:08:46,025
Where are you, Sun Young?

131
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,395
I just came outside.

132
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:52,564
Why was it me?

133
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:56,135
Why did you leave Pil Seung
outside my place?

134
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:59,175
Did you think I'd take him in...

135
00:09:00,104 --> 00:09:02,645
and raise him with joy
because I couldn't have children?

136
00:09:04,415 --> 00:09:05,984
You deceived me...

137
00:09:06,385 --> 00:09:08,344
and lurked around Pil Seung.

138
00:09:09,655 --> 00:09:11,214
Was I easy prey?

139
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,584
Did you think that little of me?

140
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:17,625
I'm sorry, Sun Young.

141
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:19,795
It was wrong of me.

142
00:09:20,665 --> 00:09:22,334
It was terrible of me.

143
00:09:23,834 --> 00:09:25,165
It was wrong?

144
00:09:26,964 --> 00:09:29,505
You duped me for 34 years...

145
00:09:30,434 --> 00:09:33,305
and you say "it was wrong?"

146
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:36,714
Sun Young.

147
00:09:37,775 --> 00:09:39,045
I wanted to...

148
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:42,415
be around Pil Seung
at the cost of doing that.

149
00:09:43,814 --> 00:09:46,285
That's how much
I wanted to see my son.

150
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:48,625
- You what?
- That's...

151
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,824
Did you just say "my son?"

152
00:09:54,324 --> 00:09:56,265
How dare you call him your son?

153
00:09:57,395 --> 00:09:59,204
How is Pil Seung your son?

154
00:10:00,035 --> 00:10:02,434
Who are you to call him yours?

155
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:03,635
How dare you?

156
00:10:03,775 --> 00:10:07,005
What right do you have
to call Pil Seung yours?

157
00:10:07,145 --> 00:10:09,444
How dare you?
Who do you think you are?

158
00:10:11,545 --> 00:10:13,214
How could you?

159
00:10:14,785 --> 00:10:18,084
How could you do this to me?

160
00:10:19,584 --> 00:10:23,224
Not knowing you were like this,
I considered you a friend.

161
00:10:23,525 --> 00:10:25,564
I cherished your friendship.

162
00:10:27,724 --> 00:10:29,434
- I'm sorry.
- How could you?

163
00:10:29,434 --> 00:10:32,334
Sun Young! Stop it.
You can't do this.

164
00:10:32,464 --> 00:10:34,204
Sun Young, leave her alone.

165
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:37,104
I'll hit her.
You stay out of the way.

166
00:10:37,574 --> 00:10:38,604
Darn you!

167
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:42,175
How dare you do this
to my daughter-in-law?

168
00:10:42,214 --> 00:10:44,175
Who are you? What are you?

169
00:10:44,175 --> 00:10:46,545
You evil witch. Darn you.

170
00:10:48,245 --> 00:10:49,655
My gosh. What's going on?

171
00:10:49,655 --> 00:10:52,255
How could you do this to me?

172
00:10:52,255 --> 00:10:54,255
You deserve to die.

173
00:10:54,285 --> 00:10:57,324
Why are Sun Young
and her mom-in-law hitting Soo Yeon?

174
00:10:57,425 --> 00:10:58,454
Darn it.

175
00:10:58,665 --> 00:11:00,295
How could you do that?

176
00:11:00,295 --> 00:11:01,724
What do you think you're doing?

177
00:11:02,265 --> 00:11:03,395
Are you crazy?

178
00:11:03,734 --> 00:11:04,765
My gosh.

179
00:11:05,135 --> 00:11:07,505
Are you okay, Soo Yeon?
What's this about?

180
00:11:07,505 --> 00:11:08,905
Why did you let them hit you?

181
00:11:09,074 --> 00:11:12,005
Kim Sun Young. Ms. So.
How dare you do this?

182
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,675
Fighting in the street like kids.

183
00:11:13,775 --> 00:11:16,415
How could you gang up on Soo Yeon?

184
00:11:16,415 --> 00:11:17,574
What's this about?

185
00:11:17,574 --> 00:11:19,444
We hit her because she deserved it!

186
00:11:19,444 --> 00:11:20,984
I had a reason!

187
00:11:20,984 --> 00:11:22,854
What did she do
to deserve to get hit?

188
00:11:22,854 --> 00:11:24,084
I don't believe this.

189
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:25,724
Whatever crime she committed,

190
00:11:25,724 --> 00:11:27,824
it's not right to do this in public.

191
00:11:27,824 --> 00:11:28,854
Let's go inside.

192
00:11:29,525 --> 00:11:32,464
I'm okay, Ae Kyo.
Stay out of it and go inside.

193
00:11:32,464 --> 00:11:35,265
How can you ask me
to stay out of it?

194
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:37,035
You're going to let them
hit you even more?

195
00:11:37,734 --> 00:11:38,864
Come inside.

196
00:11:39,805 --> 00:11:41,734
You're not going anywhere.

197
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,474
Come back here. Where do you think
you're going, witch?

198
00:11:44,474 --> 00:11:47,074
- My gosh. Are you crazy?
- Darn you!

199
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,775
How could you?

200
00:11:50,574 --> 00:11:52,745
- Mother...
- Sun Young.

201
00:11:57,155 --> 00:12:00,454
Jang Soo Yeon. Are you stupid?

202
00:12:00,785 --> 00:12:03,025
If they grabbed you by the hair,
you should've grabbed theirs.

203
00:12:03,025 --> 00:12:04,795
Why stand there and take it?

204
00:12:05,364 --> 00:12:07,824
What did you do
that they'd treat you like that?

205
00:12:09,165 --> 00:12:10,665
What did I just hear?

206
00:12:13,665 --> 00:12:16,104
My gosh. Why are you such a mess?

207
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:18,675
Who did this to you?

208
00:12:18,944 --> 00:12:20,944
Her friend, Pil Seung's mom.

209
00:12:21,305 --> 00:12:23,245
Sun Young and her mother-in-law...

210
00:12:23,245 --> 00:12:25,114
were grabbing her by the hair.

211
00:12:25,114 --> 00:12:27,084
In the middle of the street too.
It was so crass.

212
00:12:27,245 --> 00:12:30,755
What? Is that true?

213
00:12:31,415 --> 00:12:32,425
Why?

214
00:12:34,055 --> 00:12:36,125
It's nothing. I'm fine.

215
00:12:37,055 --> 00:12:38,425
What?

216
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:43,665
Soo Yeon.

217
00:12:43,895 --> 00:12:45,665
She locked the door.

218
00:12:46,064 --> 00:12:47,364
Let me in.

219
00:12:47,805 --> 00:12:49,204
Let's talk.

220
00:12:49,204 --> 00:12:51,305
What is going on?

221
00:12:51,635 --> 00:12:52,645
Oh, gosh.

222
00:12:52,645 --> 00:12:55,574
Pil Seung's mom and her mom-in-law
pulled out my mom's hair?

223
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:56,814
Is that true?

224
00:12:56,814 --> 00:12:58,545
- Yes.
- Why?

225
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:00,015
How would I know that?

226
00:13:00,084 --> 00:13:01,714
They beat up your mom...

227
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:04,285
as if they'd caught her
having an affair.

228
00:13:04,555 --> 00:13:06,484
They even cursed her out.

229
00:13:06,484 --> 00:13:10,454
What did she do so wrong
that they'd do that to her?

230
00:13:10,454 --> 00:13:11,555
I don't know.

231
00:13:11,555 --> 00:13:14,224
They used to be the best of friends.

232
00:13:15,064 --> 00:13:18,464
Did Pil Seung's grandma
let out our secret?

233
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,505
No, she promised to keep quiet.

234
00:13:21,864 --> 00:13:22,905
It's not that.

235
00:13:26,045 --> 00:13:28,775
Ms. Jang can't be here
as something urgent has come up.

236
00:13:29,344 --> 00:13:32,184
She said she'd go with
whatever decision...

237
00:13:32,184 --> 00:13:35,114
on Ms. Kim
that you two come up with.

238
00:13:36,184 --> 00:13:38,114
I asked around and Ms. Kim...

239
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,025
was forced to take the job
because she needed the money.

240
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:43,755
Ms. Kim.

241
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,594
The nightclub issues
have been settled.

242
00:13:46,594 --> 00:13:48,995
So let's just stick with Ji Young.

243
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,265
She's just perfect
for the character.

244
00:13:52,135 --> 00:13:54,005
I understand she's a rookie actress,

245
00:13:54,005 --> 00:13:55,934
but how could she cause trouble
of this magnitude?

246
00:13:55,934 --> 00:13:57,834
One should know better.

247
00:13:59,204 --> 00:14:00,405
This bothers me too much.

248
00:14:01,104 --> 00:14:04,045
Ms. Kim, she's the actress we chose.

249
00:14:04,714 --> 00:14:07,745
And Ji Young is clearly reflecting
on her mistakes.

250
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:10,015
Think of the time
we've spent together.

251
00:14:10,614 --> 00:14:13,854
I also don't want to lose her.

252
00:14:14,184 --> 00:14:16,324
She's perfect for this character,

253
00:14:16,324 --> 00:14:18,525
so I've supported her a lot.

254
00:14:18,795 --> 00:14:22,395
You saw how hard I tried
to persuade CEO Jang...

255
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,464
into casting Ji Young in our drama.

256
00:14:24,934 --> 00:14:26,964
But how could she
disappoint me like this?

257
00:14:27,064 --> 00:14:29,275
What am I supposed to do?

258
00:14:32,645 --> 00:14:33,944
My gosh.

259
00:14:37,745 --> 00:14:40,785
How could they fire you
for singing at a nightclub?

260
00:14:41,084 --> 00:14:42,984
It's not like
you stripped off your clothes.

261
00:14:42,984 --> 00:14:45,314
What are we supposed to do now?

262
00:14:46,525 --> 00:14:49,354
CEO Jae Dong said he'd look into it.

263
00:14:49,354 --> 00:14:50,995
But I'm not sure how it will end.

264
00:14:50,995 --> 00:14:53,094
I'm sure you're fired.

265
00:14:53,094 --> 00:14:56,535
I bet Pil Seung, that jerk, must've
jumped at the chance to fire you.

266
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:00,564
I thought
we finally got a good chance.

267
00:15:00,564 --> 00:15:02,934
I shouldn't have let you
do the nightclub thing.

268
00:15:02,934 --> 00:15:05,745
I should've got the money
somewhere else.

269
00:15:05,745 --> 00:15:08,074
Don't say that. I'm okay.

270
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,875
Ji Young, what is this?

271
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,785
Why does this have your face on it?
Why would you do this?

272
00:15:15,084 --> 00:15:17,854
Hey, why do you think?
She did it because of you.

273
00:15:17,854 --> 00:15:19,925
To pay your settlement.

274
00:15:21,525 --> 00:15:23,925
You said you didn't pay any money.

275
00:15:23,925 --> 00:15:25,824
Come on. Did you really buy it?

276
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:28,025
How would we get you out
without paying any money?

277
00:15:28,025 --> 00:15:29,064
What?

278
00:15:33,665 --> 00:15:35,035
Did you let her do this?

279
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,974
I just couldn't let you
go to prison.

280
00:15:37,974 --> 00:15:39,045
Still, this is just wrong.

281
00:15:39,045 --> 00:15:40,974
You should've let me go to prison!

282
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:42,444
You silly thing! How would you go...

283
00:15:43,214 --> 00:15:45,984
Hey, do you even know
what life in prison is like?

284
00:15:45,984 --> 00:15:47,314
My goodness.

285
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,984
How could you do this, Mom?

286
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:54,155
We promised we'd never let
Do Ra do stuff like this again.

287
00:15:54,155 --> 00:15:55,555
Mom, you know...

288
00:15:56,194 --> 00:15:57,824
what we went through
after Do Ra's death.

289
00:15:57,824 --> 00:15:59,364
We only made her suffer.

290
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:02,064
So, after our Do Ra came back,

291
00:16:02,064 --> 00:16:04,194
we promised not to do this
to Ji Young again.

292
00:16:04,194 --> 00:16:05,765
But why did you do this?

293
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:09,175
It's all right, Do Sik.
I said I wanted to do it.

294
00:16:09,175 --> 00:16:11,905
I'm really okay. I'm serious.

295
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:13,574
I'm the one at fault here.

296
00:16:13,574 --> 00:16:16,214
I should go to prison.
But why did you...

297
00:16:17,214 --> 00:16:19,545
Why did you do
something horrible like this?

298
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,385
Hey, Park Do Sik!
"Something horrible like this?"

299
00:16:22,385 --> 00:16:24,155
So she sang a few songs
at a nightclub.

300
00:16:24,155 --> 00:16:26,224
What's the big deal?

301
00:16:26,224 --> 00:16:28,084
It's their fault
that they fired her...

302
00:16:28,084 --> 00:16:29,755
just because she sang a few songs.

303
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,194
It's not like
she committed a crime or something.

304
00:16:31,194 --> 00:16:34,224
Hey, do you think they all are
men of high-minded principle?

305
00:16:34,324 --> 00:16:35,425
Mom.

306
00:16:36,094 --> 00:16:37,934
Seriously, you can't be doing this.

307
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,434
- That ungrateful brat.
- Gosh.

308
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:45,574
This is all I got
after getting you out of prison?

309
00:16:45,574 --> 00:16:48,505
I don't need a son like him!

310
00:16:48,505 --> 00:16:52,114
That silly thing.
He can never understand his mom.

311
00:16:52,114 --> 00:16:53,785
Gosh, seriously...

312
00:16:53,785 --> 00:16:57,055
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

313
00:16:58,155 --> 00:16:59,954
It'd be nice to have some hobbies.

314
00:17:00,385 --> 00:17:03,324
Or seeing someone else could help.

315
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,564
I'll give you a prescription,
so make sure to take some medicine.

316
00:17:10,895 --> 00:17:13,465
Fine. I'll take medicine.

317
00:17:14,735 --> 00:17:16,775
He must be called an expert
for a reason.

318
00:17:18,174 --> 00:17:20,005
Park Do Ra is dead,

319
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:22,215
but I keep seeing her
in that country bumpkin.

320
00:17:23,245 --> 00:17:26,745
It's a delusion created
by this weak mind of mine.

321
00:17:28,844 --> 00:17:30,685
I should take medicine
and fix it up.

322
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:50,626
(Tae Hee)

323
00:18:01,545 --> 00:18:03,185
Hello, Tae Hee.

324
00:18:37,685 --> 00:18:39,354
All right, Gong Jin Dan.
Pull yourself together.

325
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:43,124
Why would you be distracted
when you had this amazing woman?

326
00:18:44,755 --> 00:18:47,424
You should take the pills
and get back on track.

327
00:19:19,765 --> 00:19:22,735
What did you urgently want to say?

328
00:19:27,935 --> 00:19:29,275
I was cut from the show, wasn't I?

329
00:19:30,775 --> 00:19:32,874
That's why
you wanted to see me, right?

330
00:19:38,715 --> 00:19:40,215
I understand I deserve it.

331
00:19:41,185 --> 00:19:43,555
I have to sing another nine times
at the nightclub.

332
00:19:43,555 --> 00:19:45,215
How would I be on the drama?

333
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:47,654
No, you're not cut from the show.

334
00:19:51,055 --> 00:19:52,725
Don't tease me.

335
00:19:52,995 --> 00:19:55,765
Singing at a nightclub
is never acceptable.

336
00:19:55,765 --> 00:19:59,164
So CEO Jang and Ms. Kim
wanted to cut me out of the show.

337
00:19:59,604 --> 00:20:00,904
I'm well aware of that.

338
00:20:02,265 --> 00:20:03,404
Ji Young.

339
00:20:03,775 --> 00:20:06,445
Director Ko Pil Seung
took care of it.

340
00:20:06,945 --> 00:20:07,945
What?

341
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:11,314
Director Ko did? How?

342
00:20:11,314 --> 00:20:15,414
I scraped up 10,000 dollars
and went to the nightclub.

343
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:18,685
I was going to ask them
to cancel the contract.

344
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:19,884
But you know what?

345
00:20:19,884 --> 00:20:21,324
The penalty had already been paid.

346
00:20:21,324 --> 00:20:23,495
The contract had
already been canceled.

347
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:27,265
What are you talking about?

348
00:20:27,265 --> 00:20:30,195
Director Ko Pil Seung
went to the nightclub...

349
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:31,864
and paid the penalty.

350
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:32,864
What?

351
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,765
And CEO Jang and Ms. Kim kept...

352
00:20:34,765 --> 00:20:37,205
insisting on replacing the actress,

353
00:20:37,205 --> 00:20:40,344
but Director Ko convinced them...

354
00:20:40,344 --> 00:20:43,545
to keep you, saying
he'd take full responsibility.

355
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:46,545
Are you serious?

356
00:20:47,884 --> 00:20:49,045
Yes.

357
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:53,084
Ji Young, we have to work
really hard from now on.

358
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,154
That's the only way
we can pay him back.

359
00:20:55,154 --> 00:20:56,295
Do you understand?

360
00:20:56,594 --> 00:20:58,924
If it weren't for him,
you would've been fired.

361
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,765
Director Ko saved our lives.

362
00:21:01,495 --> 00:21:05,465
I think he cares a lot about you.

363
00:21:06,334 --> 00:21:07,664
Director Ko did that?

364
00:21:10,104 --> 00:21:13,644
(Director Ko Pil Seung)

365
00:21:21,084 --> 00:21:22,785
Hello, Director Ko.

366
00:21:23,414 --> 00:21:25,414
Could I see you for a moment?

367
00:21:32,545 --> 00:21:33,615
Director Ko.

368
00:21:35,156 --> 00:21:36,255
Thank you.

369
00:21:37,216 --> 00:21:39,626
I heard everything
from CEO Jae Dong.

370
00:21:40,585 --> 00:21:42,855
I deserved to get fired,

371
00:21:43,396 --> 00:21:46,496
but you paid the penalty for me.

372
00:21:47,825 --> 00:21:49,696
And you told CEO Jang and Ms. Kim...

373
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:52,936
that you'd take full responsibility
for issues about me.

374
00:21:54,906 --> 00:21:56,876
Thank you so much, Director Ko.

375
00:21:57,805 --> 00:22:00,105
And I'm sorry for all the trouble...

376
00:22:00,646 --> 00:22:02,416
that I've caused.

377
00:22:05,345 --> 00:22:08,416
I'd like you to work hard and pay
for it with good performances.

378
00:22:09,115 --> 00:22:12,186
Okay. I'll work really hard.

379
00:22:12,186 --> 00:22:13,855
I'll give it my best shot.

380
00:22:14,226 --> 00:22:15,295
But...

381
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:21,126
I don't have enough money...

382
00:22:21,126 --> 00:22:23,936
to pay you back at this moment.

383
00:22:27,265 --> 00:22:28,835
Once I get the down-payment,

384
00:22:28,835 --> 00:22:31,335
I'll pay what I owe you.

385
00:22:32,105 --> 00:22:34,505
Please give me some time until then.

386
00:22:37,075 --> 00:22:38,246
You can take your time.

387
00:22:40,615 --> 00:22:41,815
Listen, Ji Young.

388
00:22:43,555 --> 00:22:46,426
This time around,
we played it as a rookie mistake,

389
00:22:46,886 --> 00:22:50,025
but it won't be a mistake
if it happens again.

390
00:22:50,726 --> 00:22:52,295
The career you've been
trying to build...

391
00:22:52,295 --> 00:22:53,896
can be ruined in a heartbeat.

392
00:22:54,525 --> 00:22:56,896
Of course.
I won't let it happen again.

393
00:22:56,896 --> 00:22:58,265
Never.

394
00:22:59,105 --> 00:23:00,105
Good.

395
00:23:00,365 --> 00:23:02,436
You should forget
about past transgressions...

396
00:23:02,605 --> 00:23:03,775
and focus on your acting.

397
00:23:05,575 --> 00:23:06,605
Sure.

398
00:23:08,515 --> 00:23:11,146
The writer only decided
to give you a second chance...

399
00:23:12,246 --> 00:23:14,545
because you're vital to this series.

400
00:23:15,785 --> 00:23:19,025
So don't let what happened
intimidate you in any way.

401
00:23:20,855 --> 00:23:21,855
Right.

402
00:23:31,805 --> 00:23:32,906
Director Ko.

403
00:23:36,335 --> 00:23:39,176
You're so nice to me,

404
00:23:40,575 --> 00:23:43,115
and I don't know how to repay you.

405
00:23:44,345 --> 00:23:47,186
Ji Young, don't let it burden you.

406
00:23:47,716 --> 00:23:48,956
I promised...

407
00:23:49,216 --> 00:23:51,785
to help you in dire times.

408
00:23:52,785 --> 00:23:54,126
I said I'd protect you.

409
00:23:55,325 --> 00:23:58,396
So if you're in any trouble,
always come to me first.

410
00:24:00,265 --> 00:24:01,325
Ji Young.

411
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:04,535
Do you know why
I'm choosing to wait...

412
00:24:04,835 --> 00:24:06,706
and not approach you?

413
00:24:07,565 --> 00:24:08,605
Sorry?

414
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,845
Your life must be confusing as is.

415
00:24:11,845 --> 00:24:13,505
I don't want to add on to that.

416
00:24:14,646 --> 00:24:17,345
Until you wrap your head around
everything that's happening...

417
00:24:17,676 --> 00:24:19,315
and you find peace,

418
00:24:19,946 --> 00:24:21,285
I'm giving you time.

419
00:24:23,855 --> 00:24:26,025
If I keep approaching you...

420
00:24:26,025 --> 00:24:27,355
when you're living with Ms. Baek,

421
00:24:28,295 --> 00:24:30,956
you'll only be more torn
between me and her.

422
00:24:32,325 --> 00:24:34,426
The last thing I want
is for your life to be hard.

423
00:24:36,696 --> 00:24:38,236
When you were Do Ra,

424
00:24:39,535 --> 00:24:41,305
Ms. Baek made your life miserable.

425
00:24:41,805 --> 00:24:45,406
I'm sure Ms. Baek
was aware of your contract...

426
00:24:45,946 --> 00:24:47,406
and knew that it was a violation...

427
00:24:47,406 --> 00:24:48,946
to perform at a nightclub.

428
00:24:50,075 --> 00:24:51,946
But she still had you perform.

429
00:24:53,446 --> 00:24:56,886
Would she have suggested it
if she had truly cared for you?

430
00:25:00,886 --> 00:25:03,025
This ordeal took a toll on you.

431
00:25:04,255 --> 00:25:06,426
That's how she was with Do Ra...

432
00:25:07,065 --> 00:25:08,865
which is why I wanted you
to live as Ji Young...

433
00:25:10,065 --> 00:25:11,736
away from your family.

434
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,236
Director Ko.

435
00:25:15,005 --> 00:25:17,176
I'm grateful that you've been...

436
00:25:17,176 --> 00:25:19,105
looking out for me.

437
00:25:20,146 --> 00:25:21,946
I couldn't thank you enough.

438
00:25:22,876 --> 00:25:23,946
However,

439
00:25:25,285 --> 00:25:28,186
please don't speak ill of my mother.

440
00:25:29,085 --> 00:25:32,126
I'm happy just to have a meal...

441
00:25:32,126 --> 00:25:34,426
with my mom and brothers.

442
00:25:35,496 --> 00:25:36,696
I may be broke...

443
00:25:36,696 --> 00:25:38,996
and don't have the money
to live with them all,

444
00:25:39,196 --> 00:25:41,196
but I'm happy
to have gained a family.

445
00:25:46,035 --> 00:25:47,765
Right. Sure thing.

446
00:25:58,386 --> 00:26:01,045
This is a token of my gratitude.

447
00:26:03,315 --> 00:26:04,956
I'll get going, then.

448
00:26:32,186 --> 00:26:34,785
Why do I keep letting him
stir up my world?

449
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:40,555
Why can't I stop like the man
who badmouths my mom?

450
00:26:43,095 --> 00:26:44,355
Ji Young, stop it.

451
00:26:45,496 --> 00:26:47,025
Director Ko is a terrible person...

452
00:26:47,025 --> 00:26:49,236
who tried to get between
me and my family.

453
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:55,636
But...

454
00:26:58,406 --> 00:27:01,146
he doesn't seem like a bad person.

455
00:27:03,575 --> 00:27:06,285
How can those deer-like eyes...

456
00:27:06,446 --> 00:27:08,555
belong to someone nasty?

457
00:27:14,726 --> 00:27:16,396
What am I supposed to do?

458
00:27:33,906 --> 00:27:34,946
Gosh.

459
00:27:35,015 --> 00:27:37,746
Goodness, Ji Young.

460
00:27:38,315 --> 00:27:40,446
Jae Dong just called.

461
00:27:40,446 --> 00:27:43,716
I can't believe
you were able to keep the part.

462
00:27:43,716 --> 00:27:45,755
This is great news!

463
00:27:46,986 --> 00:27:49,295
Just a second.
The beef potato stew is almost done,

464
00:27:49,295 --> 00:27:50,595
so let's enjoy our meal...

465
00:27:50,696 --> 00:27:53,265
and find you a salon...

466
00:27:53,265 --> 00:27:55,436
that can do your hair and makeup.

467
00:27:57,236 --> 00:27:59,906
Excuse me, Ms. Baek.

468
00:28:00,035 --> 00:28:01,065
Yes?

469
00:28:02,275 --> 00:28:03,376
Well...

470
00:28:05,176 --> 00:28:07,075
No matter how hard I think about it,

471
00:28:07,075 --> 00:28:09,345
Director Ko doesn't seem like
a bad person.

472
00:28:10,575 --> 00:28:12,646
He paid the penalty
for annulling my contract.

473
00:28:12,886 --> 00:28:14,446
And even though the writer...

474
00:28:14,446 --> 00:28:17,085
wanted to go
with a different actress,

475
00:28:17,085 --> 00:28:18,956
he helped me keep the part...

476
00:28:19,255 --> 00:28:22,896
saying he'd take responsibility
for everything.

477
00:28:27,896 --> 00:28:31,136
He didn't tell me
I was Park Do Ra...

478
00:28:31,136 --> 00:28:33,565
or tell me you were my mom...

479
00:28:33,765 --> 00:28:36,105
for my own sake.

480
00:28:37,075 --> 00:28:40,575
He wanted me to live as Kim Ji Young
and not Park Do Ra.

481
00:28:41,105 --> 00:28:42,976
He knew I'd have it hard...

482
00:28:43,416 --> 00:28:44,876
if people found out who I was.

483
00:28:46,515 --> 00:28:49,755
So? What are you trying to say?

484
00:28:51,386 --> 00:28:54,656
I think I wasn't fair
to Director Ko.

485
00:28:55,825 --> 00:28:57,656
I shouldn't have...

486
00:28:57,656 --> 00:28:59,896
said those nasty things
when breaking up with him.

487
00:29:01,726 --> 00:29:02,765
Hold on.

488
00:29:03,835 --> 00:29:07,005
Are you saying
you want to date him again?

489
00:29:08,065 --> 00:29:09,075
What?

490
00:29:09,075 --> 00:29:10,936
Ji Young, get a grip on yourself.

491
00:29:11,805 --> 00:29:14,275
You're still letting him fool you.

492
00:29:14,275 --> 00:29:17,315
Why do you think he paid the penalty
on your contract?

493
00:29:17,716 --> 00:29:19,646
He's flashing his money around...

494
00:29:19,646 --> 00:29:21,486
just to trick you.

495
00:29:21,886 --> 00:29:23,716
I can't believe you.

496
00:29:24,956 --> 00:29:28,325
How could you feel something
for a man...

497
00:29:28,325 --> 00:29:31,255
who tried to keep you away
from your mother?

498
00:29:31,795 --> 00:29:33,896
Don't you even care
how I feel about this?

499
00:29:33,896 --> 00:29:35,636
Is he more important to you?

500
00:29:35,765 --> 00:29:38,196
Gosh, no.

501
00:29:38,196 --> 00:29:40,035
We'll pay him back...

502
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:43,105
the second you receive payment,
so don't get any other ideas.

503
00:29:45,246 --> 00:29:46,476
Got it.

504
00:29:46,476 --> 00:29:47,605
Gosh.

505
00:29:48,476 --> 00:29:49,775
Unbelievable.

506
00:29:50,575 --> 00:29:51,916
This is upsetting.

507
00:30:04,555 --> 00:30:07,265
Sun Young, have some porridge.

508
00:30:07,265 --> 00:30:08,936
You should at least have a bite.

509
00:30:08,936 --> 00:30:11,535
You'll pass out if you don't eat.

510
00:30:13,505 --> 00:30:15,335
- Here.
- Mother.

511
00:30:17,376 --> 00:30:19,805
How was I this stupid?

512
00:30:23,176 --> 00:30:25,785
I believed she was a good friend...

513
00:30:27,585 --> 00:30:28,855
and was grateful.

514
00:30:30,585 --> 00:30:32,226
All I thought about...

515
00:30:32,226 --> 00:30:33,855
was paying her back
for her kindness.

516
00:30:36,496 --> 00:30:39,396
How could I have not known
that something was off?

517
00:30:43,436 --> 00:30:46,265
Could there be anyone
as foolish as me?

518
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,305
Sun Young.

519
00:30:51,436 --> 00:30:54,105
When con-artists mean business
and come at their prey,

520
00:30:54,805 --> 00:30:56,416
they have no choice
but to be tricked.

521
00:30:57,615 --> 00:31:00,015
She was more than generous to you...

522
00:31:00,315 --> 00:31:02,716
and doted on Pil Seung
since he was a boy.

523
00:31:04,486 --> 00:31:07,126
She was caring for her own son,

524
00:31:07,386 --> 00:31:09,196
but we didn't suspect a thing...

525
00:31:09,295 --> 00:31:11,555
and only expressed
how grateful we were.

526
00:31:12,265 --> 00:31:13,265
Gosh.

527
00:31:14,795 --> 00:31:18,065
She tossed her own son
at someone else's nest.

528
00:31:19,706 --> 00:31:22,906
How are you the fool here?
She's the evil one!

529
00:31:23,575 --> 00:31:27,206
How could there be a human
that devious?

530
00:31:27,206 --> 00:31:28,916
That evil witch.

531
00:31:32,045 --> 00:31:33,815
Are you home? It's Ma Ri.

532
00:31:35,986 --> 00:31:38,726
Sun Young, stay here.

533
00:31:38,886 --> 00:31:40,156
I'll send her away.

534
00:31:55,065 --> 00:31:56,136
Ma Ri.

535
00:31:56,976 --> 00:31:59,376
Why are you here?

536
00:32:00,005 --> 00:32:02,075
Grandma, what's going on?

537
00:32:02,075 --> 00:32:04,876
Why did you and Ms. Kim
grab my mom by the hair?

538
00:32:04,876 --> 00:32:07,946
Did you tell people...

539
00:32:08,285 --> 00:32:11,085
about the secret you agreed to keep?

540
00:32:11,315 --> 00:32:12,386
What?

541
00:32:12,585 --> 00:32:14,456
That's...

542
00:32:15,795 --> 00:32:18,896
You said you wouldn't tell anyone.

543
00:32:19,696 --> 00:32:20,966
Ma Ri.

544
00:32:21,765 --> 00:32:25,035
At first, I wasn't
going to tell anyone.

545
00:32:25,335 --> 00:32:28,565
But the truth wasn't something
I could keep hidden.

546
00:32:29,335 --> 00:32:32,176
What your mother did
should be punished by the skies...

547
00:32:33,146 --> 00:32:34,976
which is why I couldn't
keep our promise.

548
00:32:35,976 --> 00:32:38,075
How does that make sense?

549
00:32:38,176 --> 00:32:42,386
That doesn't mean you could
grab my mom by the hair.

550
00:32:43,115 --> 00:32:44,156
Ma Ri.

551
00:32:44,156 --> 00:32:45,255
Look here, young lady.

552
00:32:45,585 --> 00:32:46,656
I know she's your mom,

553
00:32:46,656 --> 00:32:48,126
but there are things
you can't defend.

554
00:32:48,126 --> 00:32:51,126
What about our family
who lived our lives being fooled?

555
00:32:51,126 --> 00:32:52,226
Get out this second.

556
00:32:52,226 --> 00:32:54,265
And don't come back here again.

557
00:32:54,466 --> 00:32:57,896
I can't stand
the sight of your family,

558
00:32:58,535 --> 00:33:00,666
so get lost!

559
00:33:00,666 --> 00:33:01,666
Wait.

560
00:33:01,666 --> 00:33:03,176
I'm sorry.

561
00:33:03,476 --> 00:33:04,676
Ma Ri.

562
00:33:04,676 --> 00:33:05,706
Are you kidding me?

563
00:33:05,706 --> 00:33:07,646
Why would you say that to a child?
She must be startled.

564
00:33:07,646 --> 00:33:10,376
Ma Ri, wait!

565
00:33:10,815 --> 00:33:11,876
Ma Ri.

566
00:33:13,045 --> 00:33:15,815
Ma Ri, wait.

567
00:33:15,815 --> 00:33:17,916
Ma Ri, my gosh.

568
00:33:18,986 --> 00:33:21,986
I'm sorry I didn't keep our promise.

569
00:33:22,795 --> 00:33:25,926
But your mother did something wrong.

570
00:33:26,726 --> 00:33:28,666
She left Pil Seung
at our doorstep...

571
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:30,196
when he was a baby...

572
00:33:30,896 --> 00:33:33,666
and kept coming by to see us
while feigning ignorance.

573
00:33:36,035 --> 00:33:37,275
Ma Ri,

574
00:33:37,275 --> 00:33:40,376
think about how it would feel
if your best friend lied to you.

575
00:33:41,505 --> 00:33:44,015
You'd hate that friend
and feel betrayed.

576
00:33:44,746 --> 00:33:48,446
For 34 years, Pil Seung's mom...

577
00:33:48,545 --> 00:33:50,986
was fooled by your mom.

578
00:33:51,956 --> 00:33:55,726
My daughter-in-law
could pluck all her hair out,

579
00:33:56,055 --> 00:33:58,595
and your mom would still
have nothing to say.

580
00:33:59,426 --> 00:34:00,595
You know that, right?

581
00:34:00,595 --> 00:34:03,236
Yes, I know that.

582
00:34:03,795 --> 00:34:05,095
Take care.

583
00:34:05,095 --> 00:34:06,136
Ma Ri.

584
00:34:07,406 --> 00:34:08,436
Hey.

585
00:34:11,105 --> 00:34:12,406
Goodness me.

586
00:34:12,845 --> 00:34:14,505
What is all this?

587
00:34:14,876 --> 00:34:17,476
This is upsetting, to say the least.

588
00:34:21,785 --> 00:34:23,285
Honey, I'm home.

589
00:34:26,055 --> 00:34:27,385
Are you not feeling well?

590
00:34:29,095 --> 00:34:31,155
It's nothing.

591
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:32,965
I'm tired, that's all.

592
00:34:33,996 --> 00:34:35,996
You should wash up and have dinner.

593
00:34:36,965 --> 00:34:38,836
Come on.
Shouldn't I get to see you...

594
00:34:38,836 --> 00:34:40,936
after I get home from work?

595
00:34:41,465 --> 00:34:43,575
What's with you?

596
00:34:43,675 --> 00:34:45,945
Are you upset with me or something?

597
00:34:49,015 --> 00:34:52,715
What... What's with your face?

598
00:34:53,845 --> 00:34:55,285
Did something happen?

599
00:34:56,756 --> 00:34:58,316
It's nothing.

600
00:34:59,285 --> 00:35:00,325
But...

601
00:35:02,055 --> 00:35:04,226
Chairman Gong, can we talk?

602
00:35:04,996 --> 00:35:06,796
What?

603
00:35:07,666 --> 00:35:10,996
Sun Young grabbed her by the hair?

604
00:35:11,465 --> 00:35:12,735
In front of our house?

605
00:35:12,905 --> 00:35:14,166
That's right.

606
00:35:14,166 --> 00:35:17,235
It wasn't just Sun Young.
Her mother-in-law too.

607
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:19,075
But...

608
00:35:19,776 --> 00:35:21,206
But why?

609
00:35:21,805 --> 00:35:24,215
We'd like to know,
but Soo Yeon won't tell us.

610
00:35:24,715 --> 00:35:26,785
Judging by the situation,

611
00:35:26,785 --> 00:35:29,785
it does seem like
Soo Yeon's in the wrong.

612
00:35:29,816 --> 00:35:31,816
But still.

613
00:35:31,816 --> 00:35:33,256
What did she do so wrong...

614
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,285
that warranted her hair
to be grabbed?

615
00:35:35,285 --> 00:35:37,126
Why not say it in words?

616
00:35:37,425 --> 00:35:40,666
They know our family owns APP Group.

617
00:35:40,965 --> 00:35:44,936
What if someone had seen Soo Yeon
having her hair grabbed?

618
00:35:45,135 --> 00:35:46,265
It looked like...

619
00:35:46,265 --> 00:35:48,666
they were ganging up on a mistress.

620
00:35:49,175 --> 00:35:50,735
What if a weird rumor spreads...

621
00:35:50,735 --> 00:35:53,006
about her having an affair?

622
00:35:53,405 --> 00:35:56,215
Auntie, why would you say
something like that?

623
00:35:57,075 --> 00:35:58,115
Excuse me.

624
00:36:02,115 --> 00:36:04,756
Honey, please sit up.

625
00:36:13,496 --> 00:36:15,026
Is what I heard true?

626
00:36:16,066 --> 00:36:19,166
Were you attacked by Sun Young
and her mother-in-law?

627
00:36:19,166 --> 00:36:21,836
Did they do this to you?

628
00:36:24,075 --> 00:36:25,746
They had their reasons,

629
00:36:27,106 --> 00:36:28,916
so please turn a blind eye to this.

630
00:36:29,845 --> 00:36:32,215
I don't care if they
had their reasons.

631
00:36:32,215 --> 00:36:34,385
How could I turn
a blind eye to this?

632
00:36:35,246 --> 00:36:36,385
Honey.

633
00:36:38,186 --> 00:36:39,325
What I did...

634
00:36:41,885 --> 00:36:44,095
hurt Sun Young badly.

635
00:36:44,095 --> 00:36:47,425
So please don't do anything.

636
00:36:47,425 --> 00:36:50,666
I want you to turn a blind eye.

637
00:36:52,465 --> 00:36:55,805
What on earth did you do wrong?

638
00:36:55,805 --> 00:36:57,735
Just tell me.

639
00:36:59,006 --> 00:37:02,345
He's right, Soo Yeon. Just tell us.

640
00:37:02,715 --> 00:37:05,646
How else can we understand
this situation?

641
00:37:05,816 --> 00:37:07,646
She's right, Soo Yeon.

642
00:37:07,646 --> 00:37:11,155
How can you let that shabby family
do a number on you?

643
00:37:11,316 --> 00:37:14,485
I wouldn't be saying this
had you fought back.

644
00:37:14,726 --> 00:37:17,555
She let them hit her.

645
00:37:19,595 --> 00:37:21,896
I'll tell you sometime later.

646
00:37:21,896 --> 00:37:23,235
I'll tell you later,

647
00:37:23,235 --> 00:37:25,905
so stay off my case!

648
00:37:27,365 --> 00:37:29,305
Mom said she'd tell you later.

649
00:37:29,305 --> 00:37:31,706
Leave her room this instant!

650
00:37:32,175 --> 00:37:35,715
Ma Ri, calm down. This is nothing.

651
00:37:35,715 --> 00:37:37,146
Something's up with your mother,

652
00:37:37,146 --> 00:37:39,715
and we were asking out of concern.

653
00:37:40,086 --> 00:37:43,715
Can you let Soo Yeon rest tonight?

654
00:37:43,956 --> 00:37:46,356
Ma Ri, you too. Let's go.

655
00:37:58,796 --> 00:38:00,765
Don't give her a hard time.

656
00:38:00,765 --> 00:38:02,675
Why are you hounding her
when she doesn't want to talk?

657
00:38:02,675 --> 00:38:05,035
Do you three want to talk about
what's bothering you...

658
00:38:05,035 --> 00:38:08,006
when you're annoyed
to the point you don't want to talk?

659
00:38:08,376 --> 00:38:10,476
Just leave her alone!

660
00:38:23,777 --> 00:38:24,777
Mother,

661
00:38:26,376 --> 00:38:29,347
Hyun Chul, and Myung Dong.

662
00:38:31,217 --> 00:38:34,956
We'll keep this from Pil Seung.

663
00:38:37,556 --> 00:38:39,356
Mother, please.

664
00:38:40,496 --> 00:38:43,726
I don't want to drive
a knife through his heart.

665
00:38:44,336 --> 00:38:45,967
I'm begging you, Mother.

666
00:38:46,467 --> 00:38:48,166
Sun Young, my gosh.

667
00:38:49,137 --> 00:38:50,936
I may be a blabbermouth,

668
00:38:50,936 --> 00:38:52,876
but I wouldn't speak
of something like this.

669
00:38:53,237 --> 00:38:55,907
I can read the room, you know.

670
00:38:58,777 --> 00:39:01,746
Come on! I wouldn't.

671
00:39:02,987 --> 00:39:04,117
I'm home.

672
00:39:04,356 --> 00:39:06,387
Hey, Pil Seung. You're home.

673
00:39:10,927 --> 00:39:13,856
What's going on?
Did something happen?

674
00:39:14,427 --> 00:39:16,467
As if anything would be up.

675
00:39:16,467 --> 00:39:19,297
Can't you see
we're watching TV together?

676
00:39:20,836 --> 00:39:22,067
Are you sure?

677
00:39:22,166 --> 00:39:23,737
- Of course.
- Don't be ridiculous.

678
00:39:23,737 --> 00:39:26,277
You must be tired,
so head upstairs and rest.

679
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:27,976
Sure.

680
00:39:40,556 --> 00:39:41,786
Goodness.

681
00:39:43,726 --> 00:39:45,396
I can't believe her.

682
00:39:45,856 --> 00:39:47,967
How could she have
abandoned her baby...

683
00:39:47,967 --> 00:39:48,967
at her friend's house?

684
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:50,797
Are you kidding me?

685
00:39:50,797 --> 00:39:52,266
Shut that trap!

686
00:39:52,266 --> 00:39:54,766
You'd better watch
what you're saying.

687
00:39:54,766 --> 00:39:57,577
I told you
not to say a word about it.

688
00:39:57,806 --> 00:39:58,936
Fine.

689
00:40:14,757 --> 00:40:17,556
Please don't speak ill of my mother.

690
00:40:18,927 --> 00:40:22,297
I'm happy just to have a meal...

691
00:40:22,297 --> 00:40:24,737
with my mom and brothers.

692
00:40:25,597 --> 00:40:27,036
I may be broke...

693
00:40:27,036 --> 00:40:29,367
and don't have the money
to live with them all,

694
00:40:29,367 --> 00:40:31,376
but I'm happy
to have gained a family.

695
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:58,166
Ji Young, thank you
for the tote bag.

696
00:40:58,737 --> 00:41:00,197
I'll make good use of it.

697
00:41:09,007 --> 00:41:11,646
I don't want to burden you
in any way,

698
00:41:11,646 --> 00:41:12,746
so, be at ease.

699
00:41:13,476 --> 00:41:16,516
Once you regain all your memories,

700
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:18,286
you'll figure out the truth...

701
00:41:18,387 --> 00:41:20,317
and our misunderstandings
will be cleared.

702
00:41:21,626 --> 00:41:24,126
I still want you
to live as Kim Ji Young...

703
00:41:24,126 --> 00:41:26,097
without being in a world of pain.

704
00:41:27,626 --> 00:41:29,496
However, no matter
what you choose to do,

705
00:41:30,427 --> 00:41:31,436
I will support you.

706
00:41:32,297 --> 00:41:33,367
Good night.

707
00:41:39,436 --> 00:41:41,246
Why do I feel like I'm going to cry?

708
00:41:42,907 --> 00:41:46,746
Why did he send a message like this
and shake me up again?

709
00:41:47,817 --> 00:41:50,286
He could've just
thanked me for the gift.

710
00:41:51,856 --> 00:41:53,686
Who texted you this late?

711
00:41:53,686 --> 00:41:56,086
What? Oh, it's nothing.

712
00:42:09,367 --> 00:42:11,177
Where are we going?

713
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,876
Stop asking and come along.

714
00:42:13,077 --> 00:42:14,409
(Yakson House Aesthetics)

715
00:42:14,433 --> 00:42:16,263
Hello. Ms. Baek Mi Ja?

716
00:42:16,263 --> 00:42:17,504
Yes, hello.

717
00:42:17,504 --> 00:42:20,174
Actress Kim Ji Young's
first shoot is coming up.

718
00:42:20,174 --> 00:42:22,404
Can you take extra good care of her?

719
00:42:22,444 --> 00:42:24,714
- Sure. Come this way.
- Okay.

720
00:42:24,813 --> 00:42:25,873
Let's go.

721
00:42:26,813 --> 00:42:29,114
Oh, gosh. This feels amazing.

722
00:42:29,114 --> 00:42:32,054
What do you think, Ms. Kim?

723
00:42:32,754 --> 00:42:36,424
It feels so good.

724
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:39,824
I was so tired these past few days,

725
00:42:39,824 --> 00:42:42,594
and I feel so relaxed now.

726
00:42:44,663 --> 00:42:45,964
Don't you?

727
00:42:45,964 --> 00:42:49,663
I promise to take
great care of you from now on.

728
00:42:49,933 --> 00:42:52,433
You will become a star,

729
00:42:52,433 --> 00:42:54,404
and you need special care.

730
00:42:54,674 --> 00:42:55,944
Thank you.

731
00:43:00,143 --> 00:43:01,183
Ms. Baek.

732
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:10,384
- Enjoy the snacks.
- Thanks.

733
00:43:10,384 --> 00:43:12,123
- Take lots of photos.
- Okay.

734
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:14,194
- Hashtag Cha Bong Soo.
- Sure.

735
00:43:14,194 --> 00:43:16,464
Have one more. You must be tired.

736
00:43:16,993 --> 00:43:19,563
Hey, my dear Jin Dan.

737
00:43:20,094 --> 00:43:22,263
Why did you send this over?

738
00:43:22,263 --> 00:43:24,134
I did nothing for you.

739
00:43:24,404 --> 00:43:27,404
I can do this for a friend
who's working again.

740
00:43:27,844 --> 00:43:30,543
Not to mention I'm an investor now.

741
00:43:30,643 --> 00:43:33,743
Let's make this another hit, okay?

742
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:36,313
Okay. So you don't lose money,

743
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:38,754
I'll put my body and soul
into the role.

744
00:43:38,754 --> 00:43:39,784
Okay.

745
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:43,384
Sorry. My shoot starts pretty soon.

746
00:43:44,123 --> 00:43:46,094
Do you want to have a look?

747
00:43:47,254 --> 00:43:49,293
- Sure. Sounds good.
- Okay.

748
00:43:49,594 --> 00:43:51,333
Shouldn't we play a round of golf?

749
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:52,393
We should.

750
00:43:54,534 --> 00:43:55,703
I grew up...

751
00:43:56,203 --> 00:43:59,203
in the countryside,
so I'm uneducated,

752
00:43:59,373 --> 00:44:02,404
but I'm strong
and I'm good at cleaning.

753
00:44:03,103 --> 00:44:07,074
And I worked at
a Korean restaurant for a few years,

754
00:44:07,074 --> 00:44:10,614
so I'm a pretty awesome cook.

755
00:44:11,554 --> 00:44:14,683
If there's something
you want to eat, just name it.

756
00:44:14,683 --> 00:44:16,284
I'll make you anything.

757
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:20,424
Then make a soft tofu jjigae
with Manila clams.

758
00:44:22,663 --> 00:44:25,694
I'll taste that before deciding
whether or not to hire you.

759
00:44:26,464 --> 00:44:27,464
Okay.

760
00:44:28,663 --> 00:44:30,004
I understand.

761
00:44:36,143 --> 00:44:37,743
Cut, okay. Well done!

762
00:44:38,513 --> 00:44:39,513
Ji Young.

763
00:44:43,284 --> 00:44:46,013
What should I do about her?

764
00:44:46,013 --> 00:44:48,123
One glance from Pil Seung
saying she did well...

765
00:44:48,123 --> 00:44:49,554
and she's falling for him again.

766
00:44:50,384 --> 00:44:52,694
I should always be on guard.

767
00:44:55,324 --> 00:44:57,993
What is Gong Jin Dan doing here?

768
00:45:04,433 --> 00:45:07,734
The country girl really
looks like Do Ra when she does that.

769
00:45:10,804 --> 00:45:11,844
No.

770
00:45:12,574 --> 00:45:14,473
Why am I here staring at her?

771
00:45:21,953 --> 00:45:23,754
Why are you here, Mr. Gong?

772
00:45:25,024 --> 00:45:26,853
I'm here to support Cha Bong Soo.

773
00:45:27,493 --> 00:45:28,824
I invested in the project too.

774
00:45:29,694 --> 00:45:31,563
Why are you here, Ms. Baek?

775
00:45:32,793 --> 00:45:35,504
I'm here on business as well.

776
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:38,473
Goodbye, then, Mr. Gong.

777
00:45:44,873 --> 00:45:47,413
Is that Do Do girl in this drama?

778
00:45:49,614 --> 00:45:51,384
I didn't see her on the cast list.

779
00:45:52,853 --> 00:45:55,054
You did great, Ji Young.

780
00:45:55,054 --> 00:45:56,223
- Here.
- Thanks.

781
00:45:56,484 --> 00:45:59,993
How did you ace
that wordy scene in one go?

782
00:46:00,223 --> 00:46:01,723
Your brain
doesn't remember anything,

783
00:46:01,723 --> 00:46:03,864
but your body
must remember how to act.

784
00:46:04,063 --> 00:46:05,694
Your passion for acting.

785
00:46:05,864 --> 00:46:08,464
Your instinct's still there.

786
00:46:09,364 --> 00:46:10,904
It's hot, isn't it?

787
00:46:10,904 --> 00:46:11,933
What's that?

788
00:46:12,774 --> 00:46:14,603
What is she doing with Ji Young?

789
00:46:16,004 --> 00:46:17,304
Is she Ji Young's manager?

790
00:46:18,114 --> 00:46:19,844
Why didn't she just say so?

791
00:46:21,643 --> 00:46:24,754
What kind of coincidence is this?

792
00:46:32,424 --> 00:46:33,524
What's wrong with me?

793
00:46:34,924 --> 00:46:38,464
It's hot, isn't it? Well done.

794
00:46:38,464 --> 00:46:40,234
Why does the country bumpkin
look like Do Ra?

795
00:46:40,234 --> 00:46:42,304
- Is the water cool?
- Yes, it's nice.

796
00:46:42,304 --> 00:46:45,034
Drink a bit more. Goodness.

797
00:46:47,873 --> 00:46:50,873
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

798
00:47:03,683 --> 00:47:06,223
It's hot, isn't it? Well done.

799
00:47:07,353 --> 00:47:08,793
Why were they together?

800
00:47:16,634 --> 00:47:17,634
Mr. Cho.

801
00:47:18,703 --> 00:47:19,873
Look into something for me.

802
00:47:23,643 --> 00:47:24,674
Ms. So.

803
00:47:25,243 --> 00:47:27,473
Why did you assault
my daughter-in-law?

804
00:47:28,083 --> 00:47:31,654
The whole world knows Sun Young
and Soo Yeon are best friends.

805
00:47:32,054 --> 00:47:33,654
How could you join in...

806
00:47:33,654 --> 00:47:36,884
and grab my daughter-in-law
by the hair like that?

807
00:47:37,254 --> 00:47:40,194
I don't know what's going on
or what it was about,

808
00:47:40,554 --> 00:47:44,263
but I couldn't take it anymore,
so I came to hear an apology.

809
00:47:44,793 --> 00:47:48,203
You and Sun Young should
apologize to Soo Yeon sincerely.

810
00:47:48,203 --> 00:47:50,464
What? We should apologize?

811
00:47:51,163 --> 00:47:52,304
Apologize?

812
00:47:52,873 --> 00:47:55,404
The criminal
wants to be compensated?

813
00:47:55,404 --> 00:47:57,703
Who are you asking for an apology?

814
00:47:57,703 --> 00:48:00,174
- How dare you demand that from me?
- Oh, gosh.

815
00:48:00,714 --> 00:48:02,784
Ms. So.

816
00:48:04,013 --> 00:48:07,683
We wanted to sue you for assault,

817
00:48:07,813 --> 00:48:11,024
but I came to talk it out instead
for the sake of our friendship.

818
00:48:11,024 --> 00:48:13,324
How could you shout at me too?

819
00:48:13,324 --> 00:48:15,864
You what? Sue us for assault?

820
00:48:15,864 --> 00:48:18,433
Fine! Sue us.

821
00:48:18,493 --> 00:48:21,404
Sun Young can't eat or sleep
because of Soo Yeon...

822
00:48:21,404 --> 00:48:24,203
and the sense of disappointment
and betrayal.

823
00:48:24,203 --> 00:48:25,574
And you say what?

824
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:28,904
Assault? You'll sue us?
For friendship's sake?

825
00:48:28,904 --> 00:48:31,844
- Get out. I can't stand you either!
- Oh, gosh.

826
00:48:31,844 --> 00:48:34,813
I'm sick and tired of you lot.

827
00:48:34,813 --> 00:48:37,214
- Get out of here!
- Stop it.

828
00:48:37,284 --> 00:48:39,453
I don't believe that.

829
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:43,424
Listen. Sun Young
and Soo Yeon fought.

830
00:48:44,793 --> 00:48:46,054
As if they did.

831
00:48:46,054 --> 00:48:48,324
That's not a lie worth telling.

832
00:48:48,324 --> 00:48:49,793
It's true.

833
00:48:49,824 --> 00:48:52,763
Soo Yeon let Sun Young beat her up.

834
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,263
She lost some hair too.

835
00:48:54,493 --> 00:48:56,203
- Her hair was pulled out?
- Her hair was pulled out?

836
00:48:56,203 --> 00:48:58,873
Yes. So I went to Sun Young's...

837
00:48:58,873 --> 00:49:00,304
to complain about it.

838
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:03,243
I said I wanted to
sue them for assault,

839
00:49:03,243 --> 00:49:04,873
but for their friendship's sake,

840
00:49:04,873 --> 00:49:07,473
I said I'd let it go
if Sun Young apologized.

841
00:49:08,384 --> 00:49:11,013
Sun Young didn't even show herself,

842
00:49:11,013 --> 00:49:14,183
and her mother-in-law yelled at me
to sue if I wanted.

843
00:49:14,654 --> 00:49:17,453
That Sun Young's not eating
because she's disappointed...

844
00:49:17,453 --> 00:49:18,554
and feels betrayed.

845
00:49:19,054 --> 00:49:21,393
Have you heard anything...

846
00:49:21,393 --> 00:49:24,424
about what Sun Young
and Soo Yeon had been up to?

847
00:49:25,833 --> 00:49:28,603
Did they fight about that, then?

848
00:49:28,703 --> 00:49:29,763
- What?
- What?

849
00:49:30,663 --> 00:49:33,134
Word had been going around...

850
00:49:33,504 --> 00:49:36,804
among us that Sun Young's son
Pil Seung was adopted.

851
00:49:37,373 --> 00:49:40,114
Maybe Soo Yeon told someone...

852
00:49:40,114 --> 00:49:42,214
that Sun Young's son was adopted,

853
00:49:42,214 --> 00:49:43,884
and Sun Young found out.

854
00:49:44,013 --> 00:49:45,813
What else would they fight about?

855
00:49:46,714 --> 00:49:49,223
If that were so,
Soo Yeon's the weirdo.

856
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:51,384
She acted like
she cared so much for Sun Young...

857
00:49:51,384 --> 00:49:52,924
and gossiped about her in secret?

858
00:49:53,194 --> 00:49:55,563
I can't believe
that Soo Yeon would do that.

859
00:49:56,123 --> 00:49:58,393
But if they really did fight,

860
00:49:58,393 --> 00:50:02,063
Mi Sook's right. The only reason
would be Sun Young's foundling son.

861
00:50:05,774 --> 00:50:06,804
What?

862
00:50:08,103 --> 00:50:09,174
You mean...

863
00:50:10,043 --> 00:50:12,214
Pil Seung
isn't Sun Young's biological son...

864
00:50:13,574 --> 00:50:14,913
and he was adopted?

865
00:50:15,344 --> 00:50:18,884
Yes. That means that Soo Yeon
knew for a long time...

866
00:50:19,453 --> 00:50:21,924
that Sun Young's son was adopted...

867
00:50:21,924 --> 00:50:23,654
and wasn't hers by birth.

868
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:27,824
But then, the two were best friends.

869
00:50:28,524 --> 00:50:31,194
That's why she defended Sun Young...

870
00:50:31,694 --> 00:50:33,063
when others gossiped.

871
00:50:34,034 --> 00:50:37,004
But if that were the case,
she should've kept the secret.

872
00:50:37,563 --> 00:50:40,074
Why would she betray her
and talk about it behind her back?

873
00:50:41,703 --> 00:50:43,274
"Betray her?"

874
00:50:43,444 --> 00:50:45,013
What do you mean?

875
00:50:45,743 --> 00:50:47,774
The fact that Pil Seung was adopted.

876
00:50:49,013 --> 00:50:51,043
Only Soo Yeon knew the secret.

877
00:50:52,114 --> 00:50:55,284
But now everyone
we went to school with knows...

878
00:50:55,284 --> 00:50:56,683
because Soo Yeon talked.

879
00:50:58,654 --> 00:51:00,654
Is that true?

880
00:51:01,223 --> 00:51:04,563
Yes. I heard about it today...

881
00:51:04,864 --> 00:51:07,634
and I came over to tell you...

882
00:51:07,634 --> 00:51:09,134
that Pil Seung was adopted.

883
00:51:11,433 --> 00:51:13,774
The reason Sun Young's so angry...

884
00:51:15,643 --> 00:51:16,703
with Soo Yeon...

885
00:51:17,804 --> 00:51:20,413
Yes. I think that's it.

886
00:51:20,944 --> 00:51:23,043
She was betrayed
by the friend she trusted.

887
00:51:23,643 --> 00:51:25,714
She must be in such shock.

888
00:51:37,563 --> 00:51:38,563
Mom.

889
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:43,833
What you and I
talked about in the parking lot.

890
00:51:44,433 --> 00:51:46,873
Pil Seung's grandmother heard it.

891
00:51:48,603 --> 00:51:50,103
So she asked me...

892
00:51:50,103 --> 00:51:53,714
if Pil Seung was your son.

893
00:51:55,114 --> 00:51:56,944
And I said yes.

894
00:51:59,154 --> 00:52:01,623
I asked her to keep it a secret,

895
00:52:03,024 --> 00:52:05,524
but Ms. Sun Young found out too.

896
00:52:07,554 --> 00:52:09,464
Mom, this is all my fault.

897
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:11,833
I'm to blame.

898
00:52:14,293 --> 00:52:15,464
No, Ma Ri.

899
00:52:16,504 --> 00:52:18,034
You didn't do anything wrong.

900
00:52:19,373 --> 00:52:21,404
This is all my fault.

901
00:52:23,103 --> 00:52:25,013
I deserve to be punished.

902
00:52:27,674 --> 00:52:28,683
That day,

903
00:52:29,643 --> 00:52:32,583
I shouldn't have said
how I wanted to be with Pil Seung.

904
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:34,554
I should've been more careful.

905
00:52:35,284 --> 00:52:37,784
I shouldn't have mentioned his name
in the parking lot.

906
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:40,623
Mom.

907
00:52:42,324 --> 00:52:43,464
I'm sorry.

908
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:51,034
Don't be, Ma Ri.

909
00:52:53,134 --> 00:52:55,043
I broke your heart.

910
00:52:56,004 --> 00:52:59,813
And I hurt Pil Seung's
and Sun Young's feelings.

911
00:53:01,513 --> 00:53:03,714
I'm the one who made
an unforgivable mistake.

912
00:53:03,714 --> 00:53:05,884
Why would you apologize?

913
00:53:08,284 --> 00:53:10,683
Don't cry, Mom.

914
00:53:18,933 --> 00:53:21,734
I feel so bad
that I want to kill myself.

915
00:53:26,134 --> 00:53:28,174
I'm so sorry, Ma Ri.

916
00:53:33,873 --> 00:53:37,344
Sun Young is not eating anything.
What do we do?

917
00:53:38,353 --> 00:53:42,324
I wish she would like
my bean sprouts and kimchi soup.

918
00:53:48,094 --> 00:53:51,293
My gosh, Sun Young. Hey.

919
00:53:51,293 --> 00:53:54,364
Hey, Sun Young.

920
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:56,234
Are you all right?

921
00:53:56,534 --> 00:53:57,804
Sun Young.

922
00:53:58,163 --> 00:54:01,373
- Can I fix you a drink?
- No.

923
00:54:03,444 --> 00:54:04,804
It's okay, Mother.

924
00:54:05,274 --> 00:54:07,274
I'm done lying around.

925
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:10,984
Good. I'm glad to hear that.

926
00:54:11,143 --> 00:54:14,353
Why would you suffer like that
because of that useless witch?

927
00:54:14,953 --> 00:54:17,683
Sun Young,
let's just forget all about it.

928
00:54:17,683 --> 00:54:20,123
We should let it go and move on.

929
00:54:20,754 --> 00:54:23,694
Okay. That's what I want to do.

930
00:54:25,833 --> 00:54:28,194
But there's one thing
that still bothers me.

931
00:54:29,263 --> 00:54:30,464
Our Pil Seung...

932
00:54:31,163 --> 00:54:33,674
works at that darn brat's company.

933
00:54:35,143 --> 00:54:37,904
Just as you said, I'm sure...

934
00:54:38,574 --> 00:54:41,013
she set up the company...

935
00:54:41,013 --> 00:54:43,183
to have Pil Seung around.

936
00:54:43,844 --> 00:54:45,384
That's just too obvious.

937
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:48,484
But...

938
00:54:49,524 --> 00:54:51,583
I can't tell Pil Seung to quit...

939
00:54:52,054 --> 00:54:55,263
even though I know what she's up to.

940
00:54:56,763 --> 00:54:59,864
She will show her stupid face to him
when he's there.

941
00:55:01,034 --> 00:55:02,364
Whenever I think about it,

942
00:55:02,933 --> 00:55:05,333
it drives me crazy, Mother.

943
00:55:05,473 --> 00:55:07,174
Sun Young, listen.

944
00:55:07,174 --> 00:55:08,274
Excuse me.

945
00:55:10,574 --> 00:55:11,643
Sun Young.

946
00:55:13,013 --> 00:55:15,484
Hang on. What sound is this?

947
00:55:16,043 --> 00:55:19,214
Isn't this that witch's voice?

948
00:55:20,683 --> 00:55:23,123
My goodness. What?

949
00:55:24,083 --> 00:55:26,793
How dare you...

950
00:55:27,054 --> 00:55:30,223
How dare you show your face
around here?

951
00:55:30,563 --> 00:55:33,534
How do you have the nerve
to show up here?

952
00:55:35,763 --> 00:55:36,904
Hello.

953
00:55:36,904 --> 00:55:37,904
What?

954
00:55:39,473 --> 00:55:40,574
Sun Young.

955
00:55:41,274 --> 00:55:42,473
I'm here.

956
00:55:43,243 --> 00:55:44,243
How...

957
00:55:45,103 --> 00:55:46,643
How dare you show up here?

958
00:55:47,913 --> 00:55:49,643
How dare you show your face here?

959
00:56:01,094 --> 00:56:02,524
I'm sorry, Sun Young.

960
00:56:03,194 --> 00:56:05,333
I've made an unforgivable mistake.

961
00:56:05,864 --> 00:56:07,563
I know I don't deserve
your forgiveness...

962
00:56:07,563 --> 00:56:09,263
no matter how much I beg.

963
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:13,103
I swear I've never thought...

964
00:56:13,404 --> 00:56:15,703
Pil Seung was my son.

965
00:56:17,444 --> 00:56:19,674
I couldn't even bring myself
to wish for such a thing.

966
00:56:20,373 --> 00:56:22,013
You raised Pil Seung.

967
00:56:22,013 --> 00:56:23,683
He's your son, Sun Young.

968
00:56:24,643 --> 00:56:28,114
But, Sun Young,
I just wanted to see...

969
00:56:28,114 --> 00:56:30,254
how our Pil Seung was doing.
That's it.

970
00:56:30,853 --> 00:56:33,754
What? "Our Pil Seung?"

971
00:56:34,623 --> 00:56:36,123
"Our Pil Seung," you said?

972
00:56:36,123 --> 00:56:39,594
Sun Young,
I swear that's all I wanted.

973
00:56:40,634 --> 00:56:42,504
I just wanted to see...

974
00:56:43,063 --> 00:56:45,304
how he was growing.

975
00:56:45,304 --> 00:56:48,844
Who do you think you are
to watch him grow?

976
00:56:49,844 --> 00:56:52,214
What gives you the right
to watch my Pil Seung?

977
00:56:52,643 --> 00:56:54,274
How dare you?

978
00:56:54,274 --> 00:56:56,513
Sun Young, calm down.

979
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:58,654
You might pass out again.

980
00:56:58,654 --> 00:56:59,754
Stop it.

981
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,583
You started the company...

982
00:57:02,223 --> 00:57:04,623
to have Pil Seung around you, right?

983
00:57:05,254 --> 00:57:07,993
You just won him over with money
after I raised him?

984
00:57:08,563 --> 00:57:10,024
And you call yourself a human being?

985
00:57:13,063 --> 00:57:14,163
You...

986
00:57:14,763 --> 00:57:16,404
You said you were sorry.

987
00:57:17,234 --> 00:57:19,004
You said you made
an unforgivable mistake.

988
00:57:20,304 --> 00:57:22,473
Then you should let him go.

989
00:57:23,574 --> 00:57:26,513
You fire Pil Seung yourself...

990
00:57:26,513 --> 00:57:28,743
and let him leave the company.

991
00:57:28,743 --> 00:57:31,114
- Sun Young.
- Let him go this instant!

992
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,754
Let him leave the company!

993
00:57:32,754 --> 00:57:35,183
- Sun Young.
- Let my son go!

994
00:57:35,183 --> 00:57:37,723
Wait, Sun Young. That's enough.

995
00:57:37,723 --> 00:57:39,754
Hey! You have to go.

996
00:57:39,754 --> 00:57:41,353
Get out this instant!

997
00:57:41,353 --> 00:57:42,793
Stop it, Sun Young.

998
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:44,694
Hey, stop it.

999
00:57:44,964 --> 00:57:47,433
Get out! Go away!

1000
00:57:47,433 --> 00:57:50,404
I'm sorry, Sun Young.

1001
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:52,804
I can't believe this.

1002
00:57:52,804 --> 00:57:54,074
I said go away!

1003
00:57:54,274 --> 00:57:55,274
Gosh, Sun Young.

1004
00:57:55,274 --> 00:57:57,643
- Let's sit, Sun Young.
- "Our Pil Seung?"

1005
00:57:57,643 --> 00:57:59,873
Did you say, "Our Pil Seung?"

1006
00:57:59,873 --> 00:58:02,013
- Sit down.
- I'm sorry, Sun Young.

1007
00:58:02,013 --> 00:58:03,543
Get out already!

1008
00:58:03,543 --> 00:58:05,784
Stop it, Sun Young.

1009
00:58:07,614 --> 00:58:08,984
- You're home, Chairman Gong.
- Yes.

1010
00:58:10,223 --> 00:58:11,524
How is Soo Yeon doing?

1011
00:58:11,924 --> 00:58:13,953
She's out.

1012
00:58:13,953 --> 00:58:15,824
She said she'd be out for a while.

1013
00:58:17,563 --> 00:58:18,634
What?

1014
00:58:19,163 --> 00:58:21,134
Did she not tell you
where she was going?

1015
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,804
Honey.

1016
00:58:24,804 --> 00:58:26,574
- Gosh, honey.
- Ms. Jang.

1017
00:58:26,574 --> 00:58:27,904
- Are you all right?
- My goodness.

1018
00:58:27,904 --> 00:58:29,243
Let's take her to the room.

1019
00:58:29,243 --> 00:58:31,304
Honey. Let's go in.

1020
00:58:31,643 --> 00:58:33,373
Did she go to see Sun Young?

1021
00:58:34,174 --> 00:58:35,384
My goodness.

1022
00:58:42,183 --> 00:58:43,254
Did you...

1023
00:58:44,384 --> 00:58:45,793
meet Sun Young again?

1024
00:58:50,293 --> 00:58:51,364
Is it true...

1025
00:58:52,893 --> 00:58:55,464
that you said something
that hurt her feelings?

1026
00:58:57,504 --> 00:58:59,804
Is that why she's doing this to you?

1027
00:59:02,904 --> 00:59:04,074
That's not true, is it?

1028
00:59:07,174 --> 00:59:09,384
You wouldn't do such a thing.

1029
00:59:17,384 --> 00:59:18,453
Honey.

1030
00:59:19,924 --> 00:59:21,123
Please.

1031
00:59:21,993 --> 00:59:23,223
Please pretend...

1032
00:59:24,464 --> 00:59:26,234
nothing happened.

1033
00:59:27,993 --> 00:59:29,004
I will...

1034
00:59:30,203 --> 00:59:32,004
I'll take care of it.

1035
00:59:32,004 --> 00:59:33,004
Honey.

1036
00:59:33,774 --> 00:59:34,933
Please.

1037
00:59:41,614 --> 00:59:43,484
Okay. Fine.

1038
00:59:46,183 --> 00:59:47,353
Get some rest.

1039
01:00:06,433 --> 01:00:08,433
(Report on Kim Ji Young's
Recent Movements)

1040
01:00:08,433 --> 01:00:10,804
Kim Ji Young belongs
to Baek Entertainment?

1041
01:00:11,603 --> 01:00:14,543
Baek Entertainment is
Baek Mi Ja's company.

1042
01:00:16,243 --> 01:00:18,714
Does that mean Kim Ji Young
works for CEO Baek?

1043
01:00:20,214 --> 01:00:21,254
What?

1044
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:24,054
(Address: 34-8, Sangdo-ro 40da-gil,
Gusandong-gu, Seoul)

1045
01:00:24,054 --> 01:00:26,723
And why are her address
and CEO Baek's the same?

1046
01:00:28,924 --> 01:00:30,024
Does that mean...

1047
01:00:31,663 --> 01:00:33,163
they live together?

1048
01:00:45,913 --> 01:00:47,513
They do live together.

1049
01:00:48,743 --> 01:00:49,743
My gosh.

1050
01:00:50,884 --> 01:00:52,453
What is going on?

1051
01:00:58,924 --> 01:00:59,924
How dare...

1052
01:01:00,793 --> 01:01:02,123
you show up here again?

1053
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:05,163
I have something
to discuss with you.

1054
01:01:06,234 --> 01:01:07,393
It's about Pil Seung.

1055
01:01:10,304 --> 01:01:11,304
Who are you...

1056
01:01:12,134 --> 01:01:14,734
to discuss issues about Pil Seung
with me?

1057
01:01:17,274 --> 01:01:19,243
Sun Young, just as you said,

1058
01:01:20,614 --> 01:01:23,313
I was going to shut down the company
and stop seeing Pil Seung.

1059
01:01:25,183 --> 01:01:26,554
But we already...

1060
01:01:28,054 --> 01:01:30,324
started the production of the drama.

1061
01:01:31,083 --> 01:01:32,254
If the project is halted,

1062
01:01:32,254 --> 01:01:34,524
Pil Seung will have to take
responsibility for the whole thing.

1063
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:36,763
So, Sun Young,

1064
01:01:38,123 --> 01:01:40,094
I know you hate to see me,
but can you wait just a little?

1065
01:01:40,893 --> 01:01:42,833
Just until he finishes filming
this series.

1066
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:45,433
Could you wait until then?

1067
01:01:47,004 --> 01:01:50,143
As if I'd let you fool me again.

1068
01:01:51,473 --> 01:01:53,243
Don't try to pull something...

1069
01:01:53,243 --> 01:01:54,774
and just annul his contract.

1070
01:01:54,774 --> 01:01:56,083
Sun Young, it's not like that.

1071
01:01:56,614 --> 01:01:59,413
I won't be anywhere near him.

1072
01:02:01,453 --> 01:02:05,484
I'll only address him as his boss
at the production house.

1073
01:02:05,694 --> 01:02:07,824
I won't say a word
until the day I die.

1074
01:02:14,433 --> 01:02:15,603
Promise me, then.

1075
01:02:16,703 --> 01:02:19,933
You will promise me
in your own words.

1076
01:02:21,333 --> 01:02:23,873
Of course. I promise.

1077
01:02:24,404 --> 01:02:25,473
I swear.

1078
01:02:26,714 --> 01:02:28,013
I'll keep my word.

1079
01:02:29,413 --> 01:02:30,413
I'm...

1080
01:02:31,344 --> 01:02:32,853
warning you.

1081
01:02:34,554 --> 01:02:36,723
You are to stay away from Pil Seung.

1082
01:02:37,884 --> 01:02:38,953
Also,

1083
01:02:39,893 --> 01:02:42,194
you will let him go
once you're done...

1084
01:02:42,993 --> 01:02:44,364
filming this series.

1085
01:02:45,793 --> 01:02:46,864
Got it?

1086
01:02:48,464 --> 01:02:49,534
Sure.

1087
01:02:50,504 --> 01:02:52,504
I'll do that.

1088
01:02:54,804 --> 01:02:56,603
Leave if you're done talking.

1089
01:02:57,444 --> 01:02:58,913
I can't stand you.

1090
01:03:00,743 --> 01:03:01,844
Sun Young.

1091
01:03:03,214 --> 01:03:05,143
This may be hard for you to believe,

1092
01:03:08,054 --> 01:03:10,284
but I was greatly fond of you.

1093
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:16,063
I was truly grateful and happy
to have you as a friend.

1094
01:03:18,964 --> 01:03:20,694
If you can forgive me,

1095
01:03:23,234 --> 01:03:25,504
I'd like to go back
to how things were.

1096
01:03:29,143 --> 01:03:30,143
You're...

1097
01:03:32,743 --> 01:03:34,714
my only friend.

1098
01:03:35,473 --> 01:03:38,083
You're the only person
I can call a friend.

1099
01:03:40,614 --> 01:03:41,614
What?

1100
01:03:42,324 --> 01:03:43,384
A friend?

1101
01:03:45,723 --> 01:03:49,293
Did you just call me your friend?

1102
01:03:51,663 --> 01:03:55,263
Because you considered me
as a friend,

1103
01:03:56,134 --> 01:03:58,464
you left Pil Seung at my doorstep...

1104
01:03:59,833 --> 01:04:01,134
and...

1105
01:04:02,074 --> 01:04:05,304
watched him from afar
like a little thief all your life?

1106
01:04:08,984 --> 01:04:11,183
You pesky cow!

1107
01:04:11,183 --> 01:04:14,913
Do you still see her
as someone you can manipulate?

1108
01:04:14,913 --> 01:04:16,524
You evil witch!

1109
01:04:16,524 --> 01:04:18,424
How dare you?

1110
01:04:18,424 --> 01:04:20,654
You evil hag.

1111
01:04:20,654 --> 01:04:22,054
- Mom, please.
- You...

1112
01:04:22,054 --> 01:04:23,094
What is this?

1113
01:04:23,194 --> 01:04:25,364
Mom, get back here.

1114
01:04:36,074 --> 01:04:37,504
What did I just hear?

1115
01:04:40,444 --> 01:04:41,614
Ms. Jang...

1116
01:04:42,944 --> 01:04:44,183
abandoned me?

1117
01:04:52,623 --> 01:04:53,754
Ms. Jang...

1118
01:04:56,524 --> 01:04:57,563
as in you?

1119
01:05:08,034 --> 01:05:10,873
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1120
01:05:43,304 --> 01:05:45,844
Your grandma from the countryside?

1121
01:05:45,844 --> 01:05:47,313
Why are you just standing there?

1122
01:05:47,313 --> 01:05:50,183
Your husband's home,
so serve him his meal.

1123
01:05:50,313 --> 01:05:52,714
Pil Seung found out?

1124
01:05:52,714 --> 01:05:54,214
I'm sorry...

1125
01:05:54,683 --> 01:05:55,924
for being a fool.

1126
01:05:55,924 --> 01:05:59,194
Ms. Kim, can't you forgive my mom?

1127
01:05:59,194 --> 01:06:00,924
I hate my mom too,

1128
01:06:00,924 --> 01:06:04,163
but I think she had a hard time...

1129
01:06:04,163 --> 01:06:06,594
being around Pil Seung as well.

1130
01:06:06,594 --> 01:06:09,734
Is Sun Young still upset with you?

1131
01:06:09,734 --> 01:06:12,534
I want to know
what happened between you two...

1132
01:06:12,873 --> 01:06:13,873
that led you to this.

1133
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:16,404
