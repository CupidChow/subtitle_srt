(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:08,771 --> 00:00:10,340
(Episode 34)

3
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,560
Jang Soo Yeon!

4
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:23,091
Is Ko Pil Seung...

5
00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:27,061
Is Ko Pil Seung your biological son?

6
00:00:31,961 --> 00:00:33,171
You...

7
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,171
You tell me yourself.

8
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,340
Is Ko Pil Seung...

9
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:41,350
your biological son?

10
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,291
Yes.

11
00:00:51,111 --> 00:00:52,391
He is.

12
00:00:54,111 --> 00:00:55,597
Pil Seung is my son.

13
00:00:55,621 --> 00:00:56,831
What...

14
00:00:58,121 --> 00:01:00,560
You minx!

15
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,270
My gosh.

16
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:03,600
Leave.

17
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:06,041
Get out of my house.

18
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:11,170
I gave you the benefit of the doubt.

19
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:14,141
I believed a decent person
wouldn't do such a thing.

20
00:01:14,371 --> 00:01:16,371
How dare you have
another man's child...

21
00:01:16,371 --> 00:01:18,170
and raise him in secret...

22
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,180
while being the lady of this family?

23
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,990
How dare you deceive us?

24
00:01:23,211 --> 00:01:25,726
How dare you deceive Chairman Gong?

25
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,891
Even a beast would be more humane.

26
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:31,130
Jang Soo Yeon, you.
You're one wicked girl.

27
00:01:31,351 --> 00:01:33,791
How could you have kept
Pil Seung in your life...

28
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:36,937
while deceiving us all
with that angelic look on your face?

29
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:39,441
It wasn't even for a few days
but for over 30 years.

30
00:01:39,731 --> 00:01:42,836
I bet you founded GOGO Entertainment
to give it to him someday.

31
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,407
You were going to siphon...

32
00:01:44,431 --> 00:01:46,146
the family's money to him
little by little.

33
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,241
Gosh, you're a scary one.

34
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:50,217
You're a monster
in a human's clothing.

35
00:01:50,241 --> 00:01:52,650
There's no need for you
to even say that.

36
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,610
I can't live with this thing...

37
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,181
for even a second more,

38
00:01:57,181 --> 00:01:59,621
so get out of here immediately.

39
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:01,881
Leave! What...

40
00:02:01,881 --> 00:02:03,181
Why are you yelling at my mom?

41
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:06,231
Who are you to tell her to leave?

42
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,720
Gong Ma Ri.

43
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,737
You knew Pil Seung was your brother,
didn't you?

44
00:02:09,761 --> 00:02:12,871
That's why you took his side
when he argued with Jin Dan.

45
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:15,401
We finally found out
that she had been...

46
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:17,140
deceiving us all along.

47
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:21,300
- Mom...
- Mr. Kim.

48
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,670
Where's our driver Mr. Kim?

49
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,441
Ms. Yeoju? Mr. Kim!

50
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:27,811
- Yes?
- Kick Ma Ri's mom out.

51
00:02:27,811 --> 00:02:30,350
Get her out of here this second.

52
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:35,881
Don't just stand there!

53
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:37,890
- Yes, ma'am.
- Remove her.

54
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,730
Ms. Jang, I'm sorry.

55
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:47,490
- Mom!
- Ma Ri.

56
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,941
- Ma Ri, don't.
- You can't.

57
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,227
Dad, did you also tell Mom to leave?

58
00:03:11,251 --> 00:03:13,990
You didn't, right?
Great Auntie's lying, isn't she?

59
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,431
Right?

60
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,531
Dad, no. Please don't kick her out.

61
00:03:22,531 --> 00:03:25,501
When she first told me
about Pil Seung,

62
00:03:25,501 --> 00:03:27,176
I couldn't forgive her either.

63
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,781
I hated her guts.

64
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:32,281
Ma Ri...

65
00:03:33,571 --> 00:03:35,151
Were you also aware of this?

66
00:03:37,311 --> 00:03:38,521
Yes.

67
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:42,251
She kept saying
how sorry she was to you.

68
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:43,857
She felt so guilty...

69
00:03:43,881 --> 00:03:45,901
that she couldn't tell you.

70
00:03:46,251 --> 00:03:49,366
Dad, what Mom did was wrong.

71
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,490
But I gained a sweet brother.

72
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,841
That's why I don't hate her anymore.

73
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,670
Can't you think of it
that way as well?

74
00:03:57,101 --> 00:03:58,441
Have you also...

75
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:02,010
Have you also been deceiving me?

76
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,080
Gosh, no.
I wasn't trying to deceive you.

77
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,770
I was worried you'd be this angry...

78
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,841
and that Mom
would get kicked out like this.

79
00:04:09,841 --> 00:04:12,290
That's why I was too scared
to say anything.

80
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:14,160
Ma Ri...

81
00:04:14,281 --> 00:04:16,697
Dad, I'm sorry.

82
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:20,801
But can't you forgive Mom this once?

83
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:23,697
You said you loved her.

84
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:27,140
And I can't live without both of you.

85
00:04:27,531 --> 00:04:28,741
Ma Ri...

86
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,280
Listen to me loud and clear.

87
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:33,840
I can't...

88
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,210
live with your mother anymore.

89
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:43,551
Fine.

90
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,691
Then I'll live with Mom.

91
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,491
I'm going to Mom!

92
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,431
Ms. Yeoju!

93
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,561
Mr. Kim!

94
00:05:10,141 --> 00:05:11,621
Did you check your account?

95
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,780
Yes, I sure did.

96
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,751
But...

97
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,320
I did a background check on you.

98
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,861
You had nothing to your name.

99
00:05:21,151 --> 00:05:24,491
Where did you get
the 500,000 dollars?

100
00:05:26,151 --> 00:05:28,900
Quit with the nonsense
and write me a receipt.

101
00:05:29,221 --> 00:05:30,530
A receipt?

102
00:05:31,221 --> 00:05:35,077
The transfer record
serves as a receipt.

103
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:38,207
I still want a receipt.
Just write me one.

104
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:40,681
Okay, then. No problem.

105
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:42,870
I'll write you a receipt.

106
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,981
Sit tight for a moment.

107
00:05:45,641 --> 00:05:47,851
Let me see...

108
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,121
Here.

109
00:05:53,081 --> 00:05:56,691
You're welcome any time
if you need money.

110
00:06:03,091 --> 00:06:05,267
You fill your fat bellies.

111
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:06,770
You bunch of money-grubbing worms.

112
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,621
Are you about to leave?

113
00:06:24,141 --> 00:06:25,361
Yes.

114
00:06:25,951 --> 00:06:28,356
Thank you, Ji Young.

115
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,630
Thanks so much.

116
00:06:30,781 --> 00:06:34,501
Not at all.
Look after my grandma for me.

117
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,171
I will. Don't worry about her.

118
00:06:37,461 --> 00:06:38,700
Ji Young.

119
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:43,970
I really hope
you and Mr. Gong hit it off.

120
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:47,140
Wait.

121
00:06:48,101 --> 00:06:49,870
Ji Young, are you going somewhere?

122
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,471
- I'll go with you.
- No.

123
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:54,440
Ma'am. You can
hang out with me instead.

124
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,740
Get out of the way.

125
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,481
I don't like being with you.

126
00:06:58,481 --> 00:06:59,861
Take me too.

127
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,427
Grandma, I can't today.

128
00:07:03,451 --> 00:07:05,427
I have something important to do.

129
00:07:05,451 --> 00:07:09,120
Be nice and have fun with Ms. Baek.

130
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,490
I won't be gone long.

131
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,791
I don't like spending time
with this witch.

132
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:16,831
Ms. Lee, do you know
the card game Go-Stop?

133
00:07:16,831 --> 00:07:19,370
It's really fun, you know.

134
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,440
I'll teach you how to play Go-Stop.

135
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,370
Sit down right there.

136
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,411
- Go-Stop? I know how to play.
- Yes.

137
00:07:26,411 --> 00:07:28,911
- Let's play together.
- Okay.

138
00:07:28,911 --> 00:07:31,121
- I'll play Go-Stop.
- Good.

139
00:07:32,651 --> 00:07:35,680
- Okay, fine.
- Let's play right now.

140
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,550
You get the cards out of the box...

141
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,351
- and mix them up very well.
- Okay.

142
00:07:41,351 --> 00:07:43,470
After you mix them up...

143
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,710
Wait, that's Ji Young?

144
00:07:56,341 --> 00:07:58,851
Gosh. How did she get so pretty?

145
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,161
Hello, Ji Young.

146
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,570
I tried to get here early.

147
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,490
Did I make you wait?

148
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,601
No, not at all. Never.

149
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:23,371
I was excited to see you
and got here too early.

150
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,441
Have a seat, Ji Young.

151
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:45,527
You look incredible, Tae Hee.

152
00:08:45,551 --> 00:08:47,730
You look like a goddess
in these dresses.

153
00:08:47,821 --> 00:08:49,466
Jin Dan took all those photos.

154
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,801
I'm so jealous.

155
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,901
When's the wedding?

156
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,370
Right after the engagement, I think.

157
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,941
I want to marry soon
and be a good, supportive wife.

158
00:09:00,101 --> 00:09:01,441
And have a baby soon too.

159
00:09:02,171 --> 00:09:04,080
Call him over.

160
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,850
Shall I? Hang on.

161
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,860
Is he busy? He's not picking up.

162
00:09:19,051 --> 00:09:22,537
Shouldn't he take your call
however busy he is?

163
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:25,970
Yes. My darling takes my call
even if he is sleeping.

164
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,000
He must be busy.

165
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:46,691
Ji Young.
That was our first date. How was it?

166
00:09:47,451 --> 00:09:48,661
What?

167
00:09:49,351 --> 00:09:52,561
Did you have fun? I did.

168
00:09:53,921 --> 00:09:56,200
Oh... Yes.

169
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,370
I had fun too.

170
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,390
I had a nice meal
and watched a fun movie.

171
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,641
It was nice.

172
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,271
Good.

173
00:10:04,331 --> 00:10:08,541
Ji Young. You're my girlfriend now.
Do you understand?

174
00:10:10,301 --> 00:10:11,551
Yes.

175
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,781
I know.

176
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,490
Good. See you tomorrow. I'll call.

177
00:10:17,811 --> 00:10:19,090
Okay.

178
00:10:20,981 --> 00:10:23,391
Drive back safely.

179
00:10:40,231 --> 00:10:41,641
Yes, Kim Ji Young.

180
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:45,450
CEO Gong Jin Dan is now...

181
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,181
your boyfriend.

182
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:51,490
To you, Mr. Gong...

183
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:53,860
is a savior.

184
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:02,730
He saved your mom and brothers,
so you should be grateful.

185
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,041
So from now on, you must...

186
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,570
really learn to like him.

187
00:11:14,801 --> 00:11:16,480
Do you get that, Ji Young?

188
00:11:21,671 --> 00:11:23,250
Do you get it, Ji Young?

189
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,331
Ji Young. What did you two do today?

190
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:41,301
Did he take you to a nice place?

191
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:46,441
We had pasta at a restaurant
and had coffee and stuff.

192
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:50,051
Hey, you evil thing. Take this.

193
00:11:50,841 --> 00:11:54,740
Ji Young just got back from work,

194
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,917
and you didn't cook her dinner.

195
00:11:56,941 --> 00:11:59,051
Make some dumplings quickly.

196
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,061
Make just 100 dumplings.

197
00:12:01,711 --> 00:12:04,481
- What? 100 dumplings?
- Yes.

198
00:12:04,481 --> 00:12:07,390
Fine, I'll do it. I'll do anything.

199
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,236
I'll do all you ask.

200
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,591
Did she take rat poison today?

201
00:12:12,591 --> 00:12:14,801
Why is she so obedient?

202
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,601
I'm home.

203
00:12:17,601 --> 00:12:21,541
- Welcome home.
- My dear Geum Dong's back.

204
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,216
How are you, Mom?
What did you do today?

205
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,820
Well, this wench and I
played Go-Stop.

206
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:33,410
And she took
a dollar and fifty from me.

207
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,081
She's really nasty.

208
00:12:35,081 --> 00:12:37,181
- She took all your money?
- Yes.

209
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:40,466
Give it back.
Hand over the dollar fifty.

210
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:43,821
I lost money to her, punk.
I lost more than a dollar fifty.

211
00:12:43,821 --> 00:12:46,731
- How dare you...
- Don't.

212
00:12:46,731 --> 00:12:49,431
- Okay, fine. Mom, it's okay.
- Don't you hit my son.

213
00:12:49,431 --> 00:12:52,101
My goodness.
You always side with her.

214
00:12:52,101 --> 00:12:54,130
- I can't stand it.
- Sorry, Mom. Let it go.

215
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,080
I'll take it out on you tonight.

216
00:12:56,201 --> 00:12:58,040
- Come here, punk.
- Okay, sorry.

217
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,051
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- Darn you.

218
00:13:00,941 --> 00:13:02,490
What do you mean?

219
00:13:02,711 --> 00:13:05,586
Soo Yeon had a son hidden away...

220
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,021
and that son...

221
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:10,161
was Ko Pil Seung
who works at GOGO Entertainment?

222
00:13:10,851 --> 00:13:12,390
The Ko Pil Seung I know?

223
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,600
Yes.

224
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,000
I revealed this dirty secret,

225
00:13:17,091 --> 00:13:19,636
so your brother kicked Soo Yeon out.

226
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,941
Ma Ri is locked in her room
so she can't go to her mom.

227
00:13:22,431 --> 00:13:24,136
This is a huge mess.

228
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,411
Ko Pil Seung...

229
00:13:26,101 --> 00:13:28,881
That punk was Soo Yeon's hidden son?

230
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,610
No way.

231
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,147
Is this true?

232
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:33,620
It's true.

233
00:13:33,971 --> 00:13:36,441
She lied to Chairman Gong
and all of us too.

234
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:37,720
How could she?

235
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,720
People can be so scary.

236
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,931
You should've seen
the chairman's aunt slap Soo Yeon.

237
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,697
She slapped Soo Yeon?

238
00:13:47,721 --> 00:13:49,836
A slap is nothing
considering what she did.

239
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,431
She should be stoned.

240
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:55,167
Anyway, you need to
keep your wits about you right now.

241
00:13:55,191 --> 00:13:57,177
Soo Yeon's idea to start...

242
00:13:57,201 --> 00:14:00,311
GOGO Entertainment
and hire Pil Seung...

243
00:14:00,431 --> 00:14:03,647
I think it was something
she planned for a long time.

244
00:14:03,671 --> 00:14:05,101
Ma Ri is not exactly smart,

245
00:14:05,101 --> 00:14:08,047
so she got afraid
you'd become the sole heir.

246
00:14:08,071 --> 00:14:10,386
She wants to use Pil Seung
to boost Ma Ri's claim...

247
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,211
and take over APP Group.

248
00:14:12,211 --> 00:14:14,291
Says who? What right does he have?

249
00:14:14,711 --> 00:14:18,096
Anyway, your brother is
in huge shock right now.

250
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,161
And his aunt is ill in bed.

251
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:22,970
Goodness. What is this mess?

252
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:29,171
Ko Pil Seung...

253
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:32,011
I wondered why
he was so full of himself.

254
00:14:32,971 --> 00:14:34,840
It was because
Soo Yeon had his back.

255
00:14:35,571 --> 00:14:36,881
My gosh.

256
00:14:37,301 --> 00:14:39,381
What is he really?

257
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,450
He hit on Do Ra and then Ji Young.

258
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:46,960
And now he's after...

259
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,931
my family and company?

260
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:56,301
I have to do something
about that brat, Ko Pil Seung.

261
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,500
I have to nip him in the bud.

262
00:15:07,731 --> 00:15:10,110
Why isn't Mom answering the phone?

263
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,261
Ma Ri.

264
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,100
It must feel stuffy in here.

265
00:15:31,691 --> 00:15:33,171
Just hang in there a little more.

266
00:15:34,091 --> 00:15:37,041
Do Jun, I have to go to Mom now.

267
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:39,480
She's not answering my calls.

268
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,511
I need your help.

269
00:15:42,471 --> 00:15:43,710
Ma Ri.

270
00:15:44,171 --> 00:15:46,850
I wish I could help you.

271
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,651
But I can't
because it's the chairman's order.

272
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,490
I don't know what this is about,

273
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:54,820
but you should wait in your room
for now. Okay?

274
00:15:55,211 --> 00:15:56,557
Hey, Park Do Jun.

275
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,866
My mom isn't answering the phone.

276
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:01,460
I have to go find my mom!

277
00:16:03,061 --> 00:16:04,271
I'm sorry.

278
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,240
I'm sorry, Ma Ri.

279
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,441
But I have no choice.

280
00:16:10,231 --> 00:16:13,480
Mr. Kim and Ms. Yeoju
are downstairs now.

281
00:16:14,171 --> 00:16:16,281
I don't think
I can help you get out.

282
00:16:18,201 --> 00:16:21,950
Do Jun, what do I do with my mom?

283
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,620
She will be fine, won't she?

284
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,261
She will call me, right?

285
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:29,061
Of course, she will.

286
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,460
I'm sure she will call you.
Don't worry.

287
00:16:33,691 --> 00:16:35,131
Everything will be fine.

288
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,641
You're right. It will be fine.

289
00:16:39,961 --> 00:16:42,671
My mom will be fine.

290
00:16:47,971 --> 00:16:50,216
- The grapes are ripe.
- Yes.

291
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,040
The Korean melon is small,
but it's delicious.

292
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,040
- It's tasty.
- Right.

293
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,220
Wait. Ma Ri's calling me.

294
00:17:01,551 --> 00:17:02,830
Hello?

295
00:17:03,581 --> 00:17:06,330
Ma Ri,
what's the matter at this hour?

296
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,527
Grandma,
my mom got kicked out of the house.

297
00:17:08,551 --> 00:17:10,160
So I called Pil Seung,

298
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,266
but he's not answering the phone.
So I'm calling you.

299
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,240
Grandma, where is Pil Seung?

300
00:17:14,961 --> 00:17:18,371
Wait, Ma Ri.
Did your mom get kicked out?

301
00:17:18,901 --> 00:17:21,081
What are you talking about?

302
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:25,347
Dad found out
Pil Seung was Mom's son.

303
00:17:25,371 --> 00:17:27,720
So Dad kicked her out.

304
00:17:29,111 --> 00:17:31,520
Your dad found out everything?

305
00:17:31,681 --> 00:17:33,861
So he kicked her out?

306
00:17:33,911 --> 00:17:34,911
Yes.

307
00:17:34,911 --> 00:17:36,951
But Mom isn't answering her phone.

308
00:17:36,951 --> 00:17:38,760
I'm really scared.

309
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,451
I want to go and find Mom,

310
00:17:41,451 --> 00:17:43,770
but I'm locked up in my room now.

311
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:49,210
My goodness, Ma Ri.
What should we do?

312
00:17:49,431 --> 00:17:52,010
Who's that? Is something wrong?

313
00:17:53,201 --> 00:17:55,901
Listen. Chairman Gong found out...

314
00:17:55,901 --> 00:17:57,647
you were Soo Yeon's son.

315
00:17:57,671 --> 00:17:59,450
So Soo Yeon got kicked out.

316
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,050
What?

317
00:18:02,641 --> 00:18:05,627
Ma Ri says her mom is missing,

318
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,050
and she couldn't reach you.

319
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:09,161
That's why Ma Ri is calling me.

320
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:11,026
Let me talk to Ma Ri, Grandma.

321
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,530
Okay. Hang on.

322
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,427
Ma Ri, hang on a second.

323
00:18:15,451 --> 00:18:16,800
Here.

324
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,101
Ma Ri, it's me.
I'm sorry I missed your call.

325
00:18:24,361 --> 00:18:27,377
Ma Ri, stop crying.
Your mom will be fine.

326
00:18:27,401 --> 00:18:29,411
I'm sure she will call you.

327
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,216
Of course.

328
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,821
You don't have to worry.
Stop crying.

329
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:37,450
Okay. Give me a call
once you hear from your mom.

330
00:18:37,981 --> 00:18:39,661
Okay. Bye.

331
00:18:43,451 --> 00:18:47,000
That's right.
There are no secrets in this world.

332
00:18:47,651 --> 00:18:51,101
I knew
they would find out eventually.

333
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,040
But how could they kick her out
in the middle of the night?

334
00:18:54,161 --> 00:18:57,040
What are we going to do?

335
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,270
Maybe we should try...

336
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:04,050
calling Ma Ri's mom or something.

337
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,070
Gosh, this is so upsetting.

338
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:09,157
Mom. Why would we call her?

339
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:11,490
This is no time for us
to worry about that woman.

340
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,010
Just think of
what she has done to us.

341
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,331
It still makes my blood boil.

342
00:19:16,951 --> 00:19:19,020
Honey,
you shouldn't feel bad for her...

343
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,200
and end up calling her or something.

344
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,371
Why would I call her?

345
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:27,441
The last thing I want to do is
butt in someone else's business.

346
00:19:28,661 --> 00:19:31,071
I don't care
whether she gets kicked out or not.

347
00:19:34,731 --> 00:19:35,941
My goodness.

348
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,417
Ma Ri seems so frustrated.

349
00:19:38,441 --> 00:19:40,070
I get that she got kicked out,

350
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:43,720
but she should still answer
Ma Ri's calls.

351
00:19:52,921 --> 00:19:54,290
Where are you, Mom?

352
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,891
Why did you not answer my calls?

353
00:19:55,891 --> 00:19:58,090
I was afraid you'd pass out
after leaving the house like that.

354
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:01,101
Do you even know
how worried I have been?

355
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,401
Ma Ri, I'm fine. I'm really okay.

356
00:20:04,401 --> 00:20:05,881
Don't worry.

357
00:20:06,931 --> 00:20:08,710
Where are you, Mom?

358
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:11,171
I want to go to where you are.

359
00:20:11,171 --> 00:20:13,081
I want to be with you.

360
00:20:13,471 --> 00:20:16,290
But Dad wouldn't let me go out.

361
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,220
I really hate him.

362
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:21,651
Ma Ri, you should listen
to your dad for now.

363
00:20:21,651 --> 00:20:23,280
He's already upset because of me.

364
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,260
I don't want you
to make things worse for him.

365
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:29,470
Just be patient
even if you want to see me.

366
00:20:31,191 --> 00:20:33,200
I'll call you
once I'm done sorting things out.

367
00:20:34,661 --> 00:20:36,171
Are you sure?

368
00:20:36,461 --> 00:20:39,810
You won't leave me all alone
and go somewhere far away?

369
00:20:42,371 --> 00:20:44,250
What are you talking about?

370
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,980
There's no way
I will leave you alone.

371
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:50,681
So don't cry.

372
00:20:50,681 --> 00:20:53,361
Stop crying and worrying about me.

373
00:20:54,451 --> 00:20:57,131
You promise, right?

374
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,331
Sure.

375
00:21:00,191 --> 00:21:01,960
So, Ma Ri,

376
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,621
eat a lot and keep well
while I'm gone.

377
00:21:05,621 --> 00:21:06,941
Be brave, okay?

378
00:21:07,231 --> 00:21:09,276
Yes. I will.

379
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,260
Take care of yourself too.

380
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,881
Don't fall sick.

381
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,911
Okay.

382
00:21:28,052 --> 00:21:30,774
You talked to your mom
on the phone?

383
00:21:31,664 --> 00:21:32,874
Yes.

384
00:21:34,634 --> 00:21:35,973
Is she all right?

385
00:21:37,904 --> 00:21:39,443
I'm glad to hear that.

386
00:21:39,804 --> 00:21:42,443
Ma Ri, don't worry about her
and go to sleep now.

387
00:21:43,033 --> 00:21:45,614
Okay. You can call me anytime.

388
00:21:46,203 --> 00:21:48,153
All right. Bye.

389
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,753
Was that Ma Ri?

390
00:21:52,513 --> 00:21:54,524
Well... Yes.

391
00:21:54,753 --> 00:21:58,334
Ms. Jang said she'd call her
after getting things sorted out.

392
00:21:58,953 --> 00:22:00,463
She said she was doing fine.

393
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:02,834
She told Ma Ri
not to worry about her.

394
00:22:03,424 --> 00:22:06,534
I see. I'm glad to hear that.

395
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,743
If you're worried about her,
you should try...

396
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,683
calling her too.

397
00:22:15,174 --> 00:22:17,320
No. Why would I?

398
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,183
She called Ma Ri, so it's fine.

399
00:22:20,543 --> 00:22:21,949
Okay.

400
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:24,453
Oh, right. Have some fruit.

401
00:22:26,914 --> 00:22:28,423
Thanks, Mom.

402
00:22:30,554 --> 00:22:32,753
Look at you. Don't you have...

403
00:22:32,753 --> 00:22:34,963
too much work to do these days?

404
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:36,594
People would think
you are working...

405
00:22:36,594 --> 00:22:38,403
on all the projects in this country.

406
00:22:39,293 --> 00:22:41,044
Don't wear yourself out.

407
00:22:42,134 --> 00:22:43,134
I won't.

408
00:22:43,134 --> 00:22:45,973
I'm taking good care of myself,
so you don't have to worry.

409
00:22:46,564 --> 00:22:48,933
Okay. I'll be downstairs then.

410
00:22:48,933 --> 00:22:50,683
- Okay. Go and rest.
- All right.

411
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:42,364
(My friend Soo Yeon)

412
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:54,683
Gosh.

413
00:24:31,174 --> 00:24:33,483
Mr. Gong, your wife is here.

414
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:39,624
Let her in.

415
00:24:47,924 --> 00:24:51,134
We don't need any tea,
so you're excused.

416
00:24:52,293 --> 00:24:55,203
(Chairman Gong Jin Taek)

417
00:25:02,574 --> 00:25:04,884
There isn't an excuse you can make,

418
00:25:05,773 --> 00:25:08,024
so why come here to speak your mind?

419
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,453
I'm sorry, honey.

420
00:25:16,584 --> 00:25:18,594
I wronged you
in the worst way possible.

421
00:25:19,953 --> 00:25:21,634
I'm terribly sorry.

422
00:25:26,624 --> 00:25:28,173
You're sorry?

423
00:25:37,404 --> 00:25:40,054
I trusted you all these years.

424
00:25:42,043 --> 00:25:43,824
You were the only woman I loved.

425
00:25:45,983 --> 00:25:49,764
I believed our marriage
was built on love and trust.

426
00:25:50,554 --> 00:25:55,264
But you carried a child
that wasn't mine...

427
00:25:55,693 --> 00:25:58,003
and watched him grow up
all these years.

428
00:25:58,164 --> 00:26:00,774
What went through your head
while being my wife?

429
00:26:03,433 --> 00:26:04,713
What...

430
00:26:05,604 --> 00:26:07,284
was I to you all this time?

431
00:26:09,033 --> 00:26:10,644
An empty shell of a man?

432
00:26:10,644 --> 00:26:11,953
Gosh, no.

433
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:14,584
Absolutely not.

434
00:26:16,144 --> 00:26:18,753
I cherished our family...

435
00:26:20,654 --> 00:26:22,364
and only loved you.

436
00:26:24,554 --> 00:26:27,963
That is the truth.
Please believe me.

437
00:26:28,094 --> 00:26:29,463
You want me to believe you?

438
00:26:29,824 --> 00:26:31,534
When you deceived me...

439
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:34,503
and carried another man's child
to term?

440
00:26:36,493 --> 00:26:38,014
You loved me, you say?

441
00:26:38,933 --> 00:26:40,413
It wasn't love.

442
00:26:40,503 --> 00:26:43,483
You only pretended to love me
out of guilt.

443
00:26:44,743 --> 00:26:46,413
Let me ask you one thing.

444
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:50,324
Until when were you going
to deceive me?

445
00:26:50,384 --> 00:26:52,524
Until I rested in my grave?

446
00:26:53,414 --> 00:26:54,554
What were you scheming...

447
00:26:54,554 --> 00:26:56,163
to have you lie to me
all these years?

448
00:26:59,483 --> 00:27:01,304
Over the years,

449
00:27:03,424 --> 00:27:05,403
I wanted to tell you
on countless occasions.

450
00:27:08,233 --> 00:27:09,574
But...

451
00:27:11,003 --> 00:27:14,014
I knew
you'd be disappointed and hurt.

452
00:27:17,003 --> 00:27:19,413
That's why I ended up
holding the truth from you.

453
00:27:20,943 --> 00:27:22,874
When Pil Seung found out recently,

454
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:25,390
I wanted to tell you
and ask for your forgiveness,

455
00:27:25,414 --> 00:27:27,693
but you found out first.

456
00:27:27,914 --> 00:27:29,193
Honey.

457
00:27:31,354 --> 00:27:35,104
I know it's shameless of me
to even say this,

458
00:27:37,223 --> 00:27:40,643
but I loved you...

459
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:44,614
and relied on you a great deal.

460
00:27:48,574 --> 00:27:50,653
Showing tears in front of me...

461
00:27:51,574 --> 00:27:53,054
won't do you any good anymore.

462
00:28:03,783 --> 00:28:06,233
Back when I studied in the US,

463
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:11,173
I met Pil Seung's dad.

464
00:28:13,993 --> 00:28:16,473
But on a hiking trip,

465
00:28:19,634 --> 00:28:21,483
he died.

466
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:27,423
The heartache was excruciating,
and all I could see was darkness.

467
00:28:29,743 --> 00:28:32,193
Shortly after,
I came back to Korea...

468
00:28:33,914 --> 00:28:35,524
and met you.

469
00:28:37,154 --> 00:28:38,893
My father set us up.

470
00:28:40,523 --> 00:28:41,764
That's right.

471
00:28:43,453 --> 00:28:45,733
I didn't love you at first.

472
00:28:46,963 --> 00:28:48,203
But...

473
00:28:49,064 --> 00:28:50,743
thanks to you,

474
00:28:51,134 --> 00:28:53,673
the hole in my heart
was able to be healed.

475
00:28:55,604 --> 00:28:57,913
From that moment on,
I fell in love with you.

476
00:29:00,713 --> 00:29:01,953
I...

477
00:29:02,814 --> 00:29:04,324
I had no idea...

478
00:29:05,283 --> 00:29:08,723
that I was pregnant with his child.

479
00:29:15,693 --> 00:29:18,003
Sometime after meeting you,

480
00:29:19,824 --> 00:29:22,840
when you went abroad
on a business trip,

481
00:29:22,864 --> 00:29:24,143
I...

482
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:27,913
I gave birth to the child.

483
00:29:34,943 --> 00:29:36,223
I...

484
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,524
I should've told you everything
back then.

485
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:45,963
If only I had been honest
with you then.

486
00:29:47,124 --> 00:29:49,594
I have been regretting that
for over 30 years,

487
00:29:49,594 --> 00:29:50,834
and while...

488
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:53,304
living in regret,

489
00:29:55,763 --> 00:29:58,844
I let time pass without telling you.

490
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:01,344
Honey.

491
00:30:03,273 --> 00:30:05,014
Honey, I'm truly sorry.

492
00:30:05,043 --> 00:30:06,354
Never...

493
00:30:07,074 --> 00:30:09,824
did I want to hurt you.

494
00:30:12,614 --> 00:30:14,594
Are you kidding me?

495
00:30:16,453 --> 00:30:17,764
And then...

496
00:30:18,884 --> 00:30:21,203
you even had Ma Ri
deceive me as well.

497
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:25,473
My daughter was in pain and cried
because of what you did in the past.

498
00:30:25,993 --> 00:30:27,604
To keep it a secret,

499
00:30:28,564 --> 00:30:30,473
you even had her lie to me.

500
00:30:31,904 --> 00:30:33,173
I...

501
00:30:34,203 --> 00:30:36,213
can never forgive you.

502
00:30:37,003 --> 00:30:38,284
Never.

503
00:30:46,614 --> 00:30:47,963
I will go along...

504
00:30:49,354 --> 00:30:51,933
with whatever you decide.

505
00:30:58,824 --> 00:31:00,634
I'll send my lawyer to you,

506
00:31:02,164 --> 00:31:03,804
so wrap this up quietly.

507
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:07,483
I don't want to see you again,

508
00:31:10,304 --> 00:31:11,614
so leave this second.

509
00:31:13,844 --> 00:31:15,324
I'm sorry.

510
00:31:18,644 --> 00:31:20,524
For wronging you,

511
00:31:22,183 --> 00:31:24,534
I will accept every punishment.

512
00:31:28,424 --> 00:31:29,733
Honey,

513
00:31:31,493 --> 00:31:32,903
please stay healthy.

514
00:32:01,223 --> 00:32:02,933
What was that?

515
00:32:03,193 --> 00:32:05,473
You left your editing notes
on your desk?

516
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:09,403
Got it. I'll bring it to you.

517
00:32:09,933 --> 00:32:12,173
But I won't do it for free,
you know.

518
00:32:13,233 --> 00:32:14,483
Sure.

519
00:32:14,604 --> 00:32:17,514
What is it? Did Pil Seung
leave something at home?

520
00:32:18,174 --> 00:32:20,653
Yes, he forgot to take
his editing notes.

521
00:32:20,914 --> 00:32:22,874
He doesn't have time
to swing by the house...

522
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:25,094
and wants me to bring it
to the office.

523
00:32:25,314 --> 00:32:27,493
But I'm kind of busy myself.

524
00:32:28,354 --> 00:32:30,024
I'll run the errand instead.

525
00:32:30,683 --> 00:32:31,963
Really?

526
00:32:32,023 --> 00:32:33,384
- Oh, no.
- An ambulance.

527
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:35,394
- Did you call an ambulance?
- Is she breathing?

528
00:32:35,394 --> 00:32:37,499
Yes, I called them a minute ago.

529
00:32:37,523 --> 00:32:39,324
- What do we do?
- Isn't she...

530
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:41,203
- This is bad.
- Please wake up.

531
00:32:41,664 --> 00:32:42,943
Ms. Jang?

532
00:32:42,993 --> 00:32:44,203
Is she okay?

533
00:32:44,203 --> 00:32:46,104
- What's going on?
- Do you have her phone?

534
00:32:46,104 --> 00:32:47,344
Ms. Jang.

535
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:50,544
Ms. Jang, please wake up.

536
00:32:50,674 --> 00:32:51,953
Ms. Jang!

537
00:32:55,443 --> 00:32:56,653
Ms. Jang.

538
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:03,624
Oh, dear.

539
00:33:31,543 --> 00:33:33,213
One, two, three.

540
00:33:33,213 --> 00:33:34,584
(Graduation Day)

541
00:33:34,584 --> 00:33:36,584
Guys, you deserve this.

542
00:33:36,584 --> 00:33:38,154
- You too.
- One, two...

543
00:33:38,154 --> 00:33:40,364
- Dae Chung.
- Ms. Jang?

544
00:33:40,793 --> 00:33:42,163
Congratulations on your graduation.

545
00:33:43,523 --> 00:33:45,003
Thank you, Ms. Jang.

546
00:33:45,164 --> 00:33:48,104
I'm so proud of you.

547
00:33:48,164 --> 00:33:51,374
You got into a good college
and grew up be to a nice young man.

548
00:33:52,604 --> 00:33:54,634
I'm over the moon!

549
00:33:54,634 --> 00:33:55,913
Gosh.

550
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:04,253
Gosh, this jacket is a size large,

551
00:34:04,344 --> 00:34:06,354
but you're big enough to wear it.

552
00:34:06,584 --> 00:34:08,790
You've grown a lot, haven't you?

553
00:34:08,814 --> 00:34:11,283
Ms. Jang, I'll cherish this.

554
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:14,163
I'll become a success
and repay you for your kindness.

555
00:34:15,723 --> 00:34:18,173
Why would you say that
when this is nothing?

556
00:34:57,634 --> 00:35:00,935
(Chairman Gong Jin Taek)

557
00:35:02,603 --> 00:35:03,813
Hello?

558
00:35:04,474 --> 00:35:07,153
Chairman Gong, it's Ko Pil Seung.

559
00:35:08,813 --> 00:35:10,224
What is this about?

560
00:35:10,413 --> 00:35:13,389
Ms. Jang was passed out
in the building lobby.

561
00:35:13,413 --> 00:35:15,494
I brought her to the hospital,

562
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:17,463
but she still hasn't woken up.

563
00:35:18,253 --> 00:35:20,063
I'm afraid you're needed here.

564
00:35:21,623 --> 00:35:22,833
I...

565
00:35:24,594 --> 00:35:26,603
have nothing to do with that woman.

566
00:35:27,123 --> 00:35:29,273
Don't bother me
with such issues anymore.

567
00:35:35,373 --> 00:35:36,614
Pil Seung.

568
00:35:39,943 --> 00:35:41,623
Mom?

569
00:35:42,114 --> 00:35:43,950
How did you know I was here?

570
00:35:43,974 --> 00:35:45,344
Well,

571
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:48,384
I went by your office
to drop off your editing notes,

572
00:35:48,384 --> 00:35:49,559
but Soo Yeon...

573
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:51,563
Then I heard Ma Ri's mom...

574
00:35:51,753 --> 00:35:54,833
was taken to the hospital
after passing out.

575
00:35:55,454 --> 00:35:56,963
Is she all right?

576
00:35:59,963 --> 00:36:02,173
The doctor said she was all right,

577
00:36:03,193 --> 00:36:04,813
but she hadn't woken up.

578
00:36:13,674 --> 00:36:15,674
Pil Seung, you should get going.

579
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,253
I'll stay.

580
00:36:22,114 --> 00:36:23,394
I'm sorry.

581
00:36:25,054 --> 00:36:26,994
Why would you apologize?

582
00:36:28,154 --> 00:36:30,534
I'm fine.

583
00:36:31,563 --> 00:36:34,034
You have scenes to film,
so get going.

584
00:36:37,264 --> 00:36:39,474
I'm perfectly fine with this.

585
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:42,943
Now, hurry along.

586
00:36:43,474 --> 00:36:45,554
And don't worry about things here.

587
00:36:48,943 --> 00:36:50,184
Sure.

588
00:36:50,273 --> 00:36:52,253
Call me if anything happens.

589
00:36:52,413 --> 00:36:54,664
Sure. Now, get going.

590
00:37:40,406 --> 00:37:41,687
Gosh.

591
00:37:44,817 --> 00:37:46,056
Sun Young?

592
00:37:47,616 --> 00:37:50,127
How are you here?

593
00:37:51,656 --> 00:37:53,736
Even when you pass out,

594
00:37:54,026 --> 00:37:56,406
it just had to be
in front of Pil Seung.

595
00:37:58,196 --> 00:38:01,036
He saw you passed out
in the building lobby...

596
00:38:01,067 --> 00:38:02,547
and brought you to the hospital.

597
00:38:03,966 --> 00:38:05,547
He did?

598
00:38:06,437 --> 00:38:07,716
Yes.

599
00:38:08,636 --> 00:38:10,317
Pil Seung called your husband...

600
00:38:12,147 --> 00:38:14,386
He called Chairman Gong,

601
00:38:14,977 --> 00:38:16,556
but the chairman couldn't come.

602
00:38:17,747 --> 00:38:20,196
Pil Seung stayed by your side...

603
00:38:20,386 --> 00:38:22,667
but left a while ago
to film his scenes.

604
00:38:24,417 --> 00:38:27,466
I'm here by your bed
because I had no other choice.

605
00:38:29,357 --> 00:38:30,636
I'm sorry.

606
00:38:31,426 --> 00:38:33,277
Do you actually feel guilty?

607
00:38:34,426 --> 00:38:37,076
How could you let things
get this far?

608
00:38:38,437 --> 00:38:40,116
Look at you.

609
00:38:40,837 --> 00:38:42,647
I mean, just look at you.

610
00:38:44,437 --> 00:38:46,247
Because of what you did,

611
00:38:46,247 --> 00:38:48,647
Ma Ri called us last night...

612
00:38:48,647 --> 00:38:51,786
wailing in tears
about how you had gone missing.

613
00:38:52,417 --> 00:38:55,156
Hearing Ma Ri cry
broke Pil Seung's heart,

614
00:38:55,817 --> 00:38:57,357
and our family lost sleep...

615
00:38:57,357 --> 00:38:59,067
because we were upset
at the situation.

616
00:39:00,057 --> 00:39:03,466
How could you have caused
this much grief?

617
00:39:06,426 --> 00:39:07,736
I'm sorry.

618
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,846
I'm sorry, Sun Young.

619
00:39:12,736 --> 00:39:14,716
You're sorry?

620
00:39:15,307 --> 00:39:18,747
I'm sick and tired
of hearing you say you're sorry.

621
00:39:19,477 --> 00:39:20,817
I'm only here...

622
00:39:20,877 --> 00:39:23,727
because I promised Pil Seung,

623
00:39:25,147 --> 00:39:27,826
but I'm even disgusted
by the sound of your breathing.

624
00:39:29,156 --> 00:39:30,466
Sure.

625
00:39:31,817 --> 00:39:33,837
And you have every right to be.

626
00:39:36,256 --> 00:39:38,837
You have the right to hate me
for the rest of your life.

627
00:39:39,227 --> 00:39:40,636
But Sun Young,

628
00:39:42,067 --> 00:39:46,116
things were hard for me as well.

629
00:39:48,567 --> 00:39:52,087
Deceiving everyone
wasn't easy on my part.

630
00:39:55,616 --> 00:39:58,957
Even while spending time with you,
the guilt ate me up alive.

631
00:40:03,587 --> 00:40:04,926
But...

632
00:40:07,486 --> 00:40:09,767
now that the cat's out of the bag,

633
00:40:13,696 --> 00:40:15,506
I feel relieved.

634
00:40:17,136 --> 00:40:20,247
What? You feel relieved?

635
00:40:21,006 --> 00:40:22,286
For me,

636
00:40:22,636 --> 00:40:25,417
the betrayal
has hardened like a rock...

637
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:29,027
and is pressing down on my chest.

638
00:40:29,576 --> 00:40:31,357
But you feel relieved?

639
00:40:31,417 --> 00:40:34,822
I will accept any punishment
you throw my way.

640
00:40:34,846 --> 00:40:37,167
You can hit me
until your anger subsides.

641
00:40:38,587 --> 00:40:41,002
Beat me all you want.

642
00:40:41,026 --> 00:40:43,837
Until the day I die,

643
00:40:45,596 --> 00:40:47,806
I will apologize for my actions.

644
00:40:50,096 --> 00:40:51,346
But...

645
00:40:52,236 --> 00:40:55,216
Ma Ri's dad must be
as heartbroken as you are.

646
00:40:56,636 --> 00:40:58,616
My poor husband.

647
00:40:58,776 --> 00:41:00,957
My poor Ma Ri.

648
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:03,957
To know...

649
00:41:05,247 --> 00:41:09,092
that I hurt the people
who trusted and loved me?

650
00:41:09,116 --> 00:41:10,627
I can't...

651
00:41:11,957 --> 00:41:13,466
forgive myself for that.

652
00:41:26,937 --> 00:41:29,377
(Goban Restaurant)

653
00:41:33,307 --> 00:41:34,556
This is unsettling.

654
00:41:36,417 --> 00:41:38,997
I talked to Ma Ri
on the phone earlier,

655
00:41:39,317 --> 00:41:41,826
and she was in tears again.

656
00:41:42,986 --> 00:41:44,457
She asked her father...

657
00:41:44,457 --> 00:41:47,002
to forgive her mother in tears,

658
00:41:47,026 --> 00:41:48,567
but he wouldn't budge.

659
00:41:50,497 --> 00:41:52,406
A divorce seems inevitable.

660
00:41:53,826 --> 00:41:55,477
But what if they divorce?

661
00:41:55,837 --> 00:41:56,997
What else?

662
00:41:56,997 --> 00:41:59,167
A woman like that
deserves to be divorced.

663
00:41:59,167 --> 00:42:00,817
You reap what you sow.

664
00:42:01,406 --> 00:42:02,877
Who said otherwise?

665
00:42:02,877 --> 00:42:05,047
I just feel bad
for Ma Ri, that's all.

666
00:42:06,846 --> 00:42:08,087
What?

667
00:42:09,317 --> 00:42:10,687
It's Sun Young.

668
00:42:12,417 --> 00:42:13,797
Hey, Sun Young.

669
00:42:14,546 --> 00:42:17,067
What? At the hospital?

670
00:42:17,187 --> 00:42:18,426
Why are you there?

671
00:42:19,127 --> 00:42:21,397
I can't believe Soo Yeon
the more I think about her.

672
00:42:21,656 --> 00:42:24,596
She used to look down on me
on that high horse of hers,

673
00:42:24,596 --> 00:42:27,442
but she abandoned her child
at her friend's house...

674
00:42:27,466 --> 00:42:28,942
and deceived everyone.

675
00:42:28,966 --> 00:42:31,576
I can't believe it.

676
00:42:33,006 --> 00:42:34,216
What?

677
00:42:35,307 --> 00:42:36,817
That looked like Sang Gu.

678
00:42:43,076 --> 00:42:44,493
I must be losing my mind.

679
00:42:44,517 --> 00:42:45,817
Why would Sang Gu be here...

680
00:42:45,817 --> 00:42:47,457
when he should be
in the Philippines?

681
00:42:48,386 --> 00:42:50,767
Am I still not over him?

682
00:42:51,616 --> 00:42:52,703
Silly me.

683
00:42:52,727 --> 00:42:56,067
Why think about a man
who is happily married?

684
00:42:57,357 --> 00:42:58,636
Oh, well.

685
00:43:10,377 --> 00:43:11,817
Did you have lunch?

686
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:14,656
Wait. That's Ko Pil Seung.

687
00:43:14,946 --> 00:43:16,457
What's he still doing here?

(Chairman Gong Jin Taek)

689
00:43:25,287 --> 00:43:26,567
What is it?

690
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:29,067
Are you going to let Ko Pil Seung...

691
00:43:29,127 --> 00:43:30,966
roam around the building like that?

692
00:43:32,727 --> 00:43:37,107
Soo Yeon started a company,
hired him, and lied to us.

693
00:43:37,167 --> 00:43:38,477
Aren't you angry at all?

694
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,437
What if word were to get out?

695
00:43:40,437 --> 00:43:42,147
How would that make us look?

696
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:44,247
If you came to say that, leave.

697
00:43:45,377 --> 00:43:47,183
If you can't do it,
I'll do it myself.

698
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:48,687
Let me take care of it all.

699
00:43:48,776 --> 00:43:50,056
Gong Jin Dan!

700
00:43:50,517 --> 00:43:51,826
Don't you do anything!

has been shut down.)

("The House of Roses" filming set)

703
00:44:02,497 --> 00:44:05,337
- We have a shoot scheduled.
- What's this?

704
00:44:06,497 --> 00:44:07,997
- We can't go in?
- Why not?

This is our set. Step aside.

What's going on here?
Why won't you let us shoot?

Director Ko,
you're fired as of today.

712
00:44:33,486 --> 00:44:34,603
What?

713
00:44:34,627 --> 00:44:37,767
Filming will resume
once we have a replacement.

714
00:44:38,227 --> 00:44:39,576
That's final.

715
00:44:39,897 --> 00:44:41,437
I'm being replaced?

00:45:14,296 --> 00:45:16,747
I can't leave without a fair reason.

725
00:45:20,906 --> 00:45:24,286
Are you pretending not to know,
or do you really not know?

726
00:45:25,506 --> 00:45:29,116
You're the son
Jang Soo Yeon kept hidden.

727
00:45:32,346 --> 00:45:33,897
Is that the reason?

728
00:45:34,616 --> 00:45:38,267
I really couldn't understand.

729
00:45:38,857 --> 00:45:42,806
Why did Soo Yeon
pay so much to hire you?

730
00:45:43,696 --> 00:45:45,306
I was shocked to know why.

731
00:45:45,796 --> 00:45:49,477
It was to spoil the son
she'd kept hidden from everyone.

732
00:45:51,167 --> 00:45:52,406
Isn't that...

733
00:45:53,207 --> 00:45:56,116
enough of a reason to fire anyone?

734
00:45:56,307 --> 00:45:58,417
If that's the reason, I won't leave.

735
00:45:59,676 --> 00:46:02,187
I don't know what right
you think you have to do this,

736
00:46:02,576 --> 00:46:06,656
but I won't quit
until this drama is done.

737
00:46:07,886 --> 00:46:09,826
Darn it.

738
00:46:11,256 --> 00:46:15,636
I was going to let you quit
with your dignity intact.

739
00:46:15,957 --> 00:46:18,267
You must want to get dragged out.

740
00:46:19,127 --> 00:46:21,837
Okay, then.
I'll let you have your way.

741
00:46:39,216 --> 00:46:40,687
The first episode airs
in a few days.

742
00:46:40,687 --> 00:46:42,732
Why would he switch directors now?

743
00:46:42,756 --> 00:46:44,362
And he sent men
to block the set entrance?

744
00:46:44,386 --> 00:46:46,966
Isn't that what thugs did
30 years ago?

745
00:46:47,426 --> 00:46:51,132
Director.
I need to know what's going on.

746
00:46:51,156 --> 00:46:52,937
Where is Ms. Jang?

747
00:46:52,966 --> 00:46:55,076
Was this her idea?

748
00:46:55,426 --> 00:46:56,946
It wasn't.

749
00:46:57,096 --> 00:47:00,247
Ms. Jang was admitted
after she passed out.

750
00:47:01,136 --> 00:47:05,786
Then is that Gong Jin Dan guy
doing this?

751
00:47:06,776 --> 00:47:09,147
I get that
he's one of the shareholders,

752
00:47:09,147 --> 00:47:11,127
but who is he to act like this?

753
00:47:11,276 --> 00:47:13,346
So what if he's
APP Group's late chairman's son?

754
00:47:13,346 --> 00:47:16,557
GOGO Entertainment's CEO
is Jang Soo Yeon.

755
00:47:16,557 --> 00:47:18,763
Who is he to bark orders at us?

756
00:47:18,787 --> 00:47:21,596
Why does he want to fire
a perfectly competent director?

757
00:47:22,087 --> 00:47:25,203
Did Director Ko
embezzle studio funds?

758
00:47:25,227 --> 00:47:27,636
No, he didn't embezzle funds.

759
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:30,107
It's not that.

760
00:47:32,567 --> 00:47:35,267
What is it? Will you just tell us?

761
00:47:35,267 --> 00:47:37,477
We must know the reason
if we're to find a solution.

762
00:47:37,477 --> 00:47:39,417
What if the drama fails to air?

763
00:47:41,046 --> 00:47:42,687
Director Ko...

764
00:47:43,776 --> 00:47:46,397
is the son Ms. Jang had in secret.

765
00:47:47,647 --> 00:47:50,696
What? He's who?

766
00:47:53,256 --> 00:47:56,136
What? What are you talking about?

767
00:47:56,826 --> 00:47:59,437
What did you say, Director?

768
00:47:59,826 --> 00:48:02,342
I did a video call
with Director Ko's mom.

769
00:48:02,366 --> 00:48:03,846
Who was that?

770
00:48:04,366 --> 00:48:06,616
She's the mom who raised him.

771
00:48:07,136 --> 00:48:10,986
There was a secret
surrounding Director Ko's birth.

772
00:48:11,537 --> 00:48:13,453
It came out and Ms. Jang fainted.

773
00:48:13,477 --> 00:48:15,917
There's a rumor
that she'll get divorced soon...

774
00:48:16,216 --> 00:48:18,293
and step down as CEO.

775
00:48:18,317 --> 00:48:21,022
My gosh. This is crazy if it's true.

776
00:48:21,046 --> 00:48:22,727
Oh, I don't know.

777
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:24,393
Forget that craziness.

778
00:48:24,417 --> 00:48:26,402
That's their family matter.

779
00:48:26,426 --> 00:48:28,232
We must air our drama on time.

780
00:48:28,256 --> 00:48:30,603
It's a promise we made
to our viewers.

781
00:48:30,627 --> 00:48:33,107
What happens to the drama
if we switch directors now?

782
00:48:33,796 --> 00:48:35,426
Yes, you have a point.

783
00:48:35,426 --> 00:48:37,337
We must complete the drama.

784
00:48:37,337 --> 00:48:40,513
Tell the family to sort out
that issue among themselves.

785
00:48:40,537 --> 00:48:42,736
If they fire Director Ko for that,

786
00:48:42,736 --> 00:48:44,317
I won't hand in any more scripts.

787
00:48:44,977 --> 00:48:47,283
Director.
Relay this message clearly.

788
00:48:47,307 --> 00:48:50,386
If they switch directors, I'm out.

789
00:48:51,216 --> 00:48:53,096
If Director Ko's out, I'm out too.

790
00:48:53,647 --> 00:48:55,592
I joined to work with him.

791
00:48:55,616 --> 00:48:58,132
I have no reason to stay if he goes.

792
00:48:58,156 --> 00:48:59,397
Right.

793
00:48:59,526 --> 00:49:00,526
Director.

794
00:49:00,526 --> 00:49:03,203
Call Ms. Jang to see how she is...

795
00:49:03,227 --> 00:49:05,707
and tell her to come in
and sort this out.

796
00:49:08,826 --> 00:49:12,272
Why make me porridge
when you're busy at the restaurant?

797
00:49:12,296 --> 00:49:13,547
Eat.

798
00:49:15,207 --> 00:49:17,446
I didn't make it for you.

799
00:49:17,607 --> 00:49:19,756
I made it
so Pil Seung would worry less.

800
00:49:20,446 --> 00:49:24,027
The longer you're here,
the more he'll get stressed out.

801
00:49:25,716 --> 00:49:28,826
Eat, get well,
and go on with your life.

802
00:49:34,457 --> 00:49:35,937
Thanks.

803
00:49:37,026 --> 00:49:38,636
I'll eat it later.

804
00:49:39,966 --> 00:49:41,477
Eat it right now.

805
00:49:41,897 --> 00:49:43,277
Eat up...

806
00:49:43,337 --> 00:49:44,906
so I can go.

807
00:49:46,037 --> 00:49:48,216
Must I wait until you're done?

808
00:49:54,307 --> 00:49:56,656
Okay. I'll eat.

809
00:50:11,426 --> 00:50:13,127
(This is to inform
you're suspended from duties...)

810
00:50:13,127 --> 00:50:14,667
(as CEO and that
you will be dismissed.)

811
00:50:23,337 --> 00:50:26,386
Hello, Director Yoon.

812
00:50:28,747 --> 00:50:29,957
What?

813
00:50:31,017 --> 00:50:32,286
Director Ko?

814
00:50:38,656 --> 00:50:39,933
Ms. Jang.

815
00:50:39,957 --> 00:50:42,002
What's going on?

816
00:50:42,026 --> 00:50:44,207
Did Chairman Gong really do this?

817
00:50:44,326 --> 00:50:47,743
How could they cancel the filming
of a drama that will air soon?

818
00:50:47,767 --> 00:50:50,672
Does it make sense that they demand
we replace our director?

819
00:50:50,696 --> 00:50:53,736
I wrote scripts for over 20 years
and this is a first.

820
00:50:53,736 --> 00:50:56,017
I'm really sorry.

821
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:58,216
I'll take care of it.

822
00:50:59,176 --> 00:51:01,056
Director Ko, can I have a word?

823
00:51:08,417 --> 00:51:09,826
You must be in shock.

824
00:51:12,187 --> 00:51:13,667
Are you all right?

825
00:51:13,957 --> 00:51:15,696
I'm fine.

826
00:51:16,696 --> 00:51:19,536
Director Ko. I'm sorry.

827
00:51:20,026 --> 00:51:21,842
It's my fault that this happened.

828
00:51:21,866 --> 00:51:23,877
I'll sort it out somehow.

829
00:51:24,537 --> 00:51:26,747
Was this
Chairman Gong Jin Taek's order?

830
00:51:27,736 --> 00:51:29,612
I'll talk to him, then.

831
00:51:29,636 --> 00:51:32,283
Whatever the reason,
he can't do this right before we air.

832
00:51:32,307 --> 00:51:34,386
Director Ko. Don't.

833
00:51:34,807 --> 00:51:36,056
That's not right.

834
00:51:36,417 --> 00:51:38,127
You shouldn't get involved.

835
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:40,227
Do you get what I mean?

836
00:51:40,946 --> 00:51:42,263
Leave it to me.

837
00:51:42,287 --> 00:51:44,767
I'll sort it out and call you.

838
00:51:51,557 --> 00:51:52,767
Darn it.

839
00:52:00,236 --> 00:52:02,247
Okay, so...

840
00:52:02,537 --> 00:52:04,486
today's shoot is canceled.

841
00:52:04,807 --> 00:52:08,817
I'll call when the issue's solved,
and we have a new schedule.

842
00:52:10,216 --> 00:52:11,457
Director Ko.

843
00:52:12,247 --> 00:52:15,056
We're all on your side. Stay strong.

844
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:17,497
Tell Chairman Gong.

845
00:52:17,787 --> 00:52:20,267
I won't write if you're replaced.

846
00:52:20,826 --> 00:52:22,667
Stay strong, Director Ko.

847
00:52:22,897 --> 00:52:25,607
Shall we all cheer for our director?

848
00:52:26,466 --> 00:52:27,866
Director Ko.

849
00:52:27,866 --> 00:52:29,337
- Stay strong!
- Stay strong!

850
00:52:30,966 --> 00:52:33,216
- Let's do this!
- Yes!

851
00:52:37,437 --> 00:52:38,687
Stay strong.

852
00:52:39,546 --> 00:52:41,977
(Chairman Gong Jin Taek)

853
00:52:42,747 --> 00:52:44,556
How could you do this?

854
00:52:45,576 --> 00:52:47,056
What is it this time?

855
00:52:48,147 --> 00:52:50,797
From now on,
don't come in without permission.

856
00:52:51,756 --> 00:52:52,966
Honey.

857
00:52:53,326 --> 00:52:55,802
I get that you hate me,

858
00:52:55,826 --> 00:52:57,937
but you can't shut down the studio.

859
00:52:58,526 --> 00:53:00,497
All the staff members
including the actors, directors,

860
00:53:00,497 --> 00:53:02,906
and writers are working really hard.

861
00:53:05,997 --> 00:53:08,547
Don't tell me
you really don't know why.

862
00:53:08,736 --> 00:53:11,917
You've been deceiving me
with all those lies.

863
00:53:12,107 --> 00:53:14,587
And you hired
your secret child there.

864
00:53:15,247 --> 00:53:17,256
Do you honestly expect me
to sit back and do nothing?

865
00:53:17,817 --> 00:53:19,756
- Honey.
- Did you say "Honey?"

866
00:53:19,787 --> 00:53:21,663
Don't call me like that.

867
00:53:21,687 --> 00:53:24,687
(Chairman Gong Jin Taek)

868
00:53:25,917 --> 00:53:27,656
I don't even have
the slightest intention...

869
00:53:27,656 --> 00:53:28,937
to make you forgive me.

870
00:53:29,656 --> 00:53:32,866
I know I made
an unforgivable mistake.

871
00:53:33,426 --> 00:53:35,426
But Pil Seung didn't know anything.

872
00:53:35,426 --> 00:53:37,072
He didn't do anything wrong.

873
00:53:37,096 --> 00:53:39,837
I hired him when he was doing fine
at the broadcasting station.

874
00:53:39,837 --> 00:53:42,946
This is all my doing.
I'm to blame for everything.

875
00:53:43,006 --> 00:53:44,136
I'm the one in the wrong,

876
00:53:44,136 --> 00:53:46,346
but why are you
trying to hurt other people?

877
00:53:46,346 --> 00:53:50,123
So, honey,
please cancel the shutdown.

878
00:53:50,147 --> 00:53:51,556
I'm begging you.

879
00:53:51,616 --> 00:53:53,317
The show will go on air soon.

880
00:53:53,317 --> 00:53:55,826
You can't be doing this.

881
00:53:57,116 --> 00:53:58,966
Have Ko Pil Seung quit.

882
00:53:59,857 --> 00:54:02,337
Then I'll cancel the shutdown.

883
00:54:03,127 --> 00:54:04,466
It doesn't have to be
Ko Pil Seung...

884
00:54:04,796 --> 00:54:08,107
who directs the drama series.

885
00:54:08,926 --> 00:54:10,647
I told you.

886
00:54:10,736 --> 00:54:12,437
My Pil Seung
didn't do anything wrong.

887
00:54:12,437 --> 00:54:14,716
But why are you being like this?

888
00:54:16,276 --> 00:54:17,886
"My Pil Seung?"

889
00:54:19,877 --> 00:54:21,087
Mr. Kim.

890
00:54:21,546 --> 00:54:22,886
Mr. Kim!

891
00:54:23,977 --> 00:54:24,977
Yes, sir.

892
00:54:24,977 --> 00:54:26,293
Take this woman away this instant.

893
00:54:26,317 --> 00:54:27,817
And don't let her in ever again.

894
00:54:27,817 --> 00:54:29,287
- Honey.
- Ma'am.

895
00:54:29,287 --> 00:54:30,656
Hang on. Honey.

896
00:54:30,656 --> 00:54:32,386
Please leave Pil Seung be.

897
00:54:32,386 --> 00:54:33,557
Please leave him alone.

898
00:54:33,557 --> 00:54:35,526
I'm the one to blame.

899
00:54:35,526 --> 00:54:36,997
Hang on. Let go of me!

900
00:54:36,997 --> 00:54:38,227
Mr. Kim, what are you waiting for?

901
00:54:38,227 --> 00:54:39,997
I'm sorry, ma'am. Please get out.

902
00:54:39,997 --> 00:54:41,067
Honey.

903
00:54:41,067 --> 00:54:44,067
Please don't do anything
to hurt Pil Seung.

904
00:54:44,067 --> 00:54:45,676
Please.

905
00:54:55,147 --> 00:54:59,127
I'm sure Chairman Gong is
going to get divorced.

906
00:55:00,017 --> 00:55:02,357
What will happen
if he gets divorced?

907
00:55:02,986 --> 00:55:05,997
What if he meets someone else
and gets her pregnant?

908
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:08,466
It will be a big headache.

909
00:55:09,386 --> 00:55:11,167
Maybe I should've turned
a blind eye to it.

910
00:55:11,826 --> 00:55:12,826
Gosh, no.

911
00:55:12,826 --> 00:55:14,837
This isn't something
I can just let it slide.

912
00:55:15,026 --> 00:55:16,897
How could she even think...

913
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:19,247
about bringing
his secret child into our family?

914
00:55:19,906 --> 00:55:21,946
That horrifying witch.

915
00:55:25,837 --> 00:55:27,087
Who is this?

916
00:55:29,647 --> 00:55:30,986
Hello?

917
00:55:31,417 --> 00:55:33,497
It's me, Ae Kyo.

918
00:55:36,216 --> 00:55:37,527
Sang Gu?

919
00:55:51,537 --> 00:55:52,846
It's been a while.

920
00:55:53,866 --> 00:55:56,846
Yes. It's been a long time.

921
00:56:40,446 --> 00:56:41,696
Director Ko.

922
00:56:47,587 --> 00:56:48,866
Ji Young.

923
00:56:50,127 --> 00:56:52,267
What are you doing here
at this hour?

924
00:56:59,497 --> 00:57:02,676
I had a drink with the other actors.

925
00:57:03,006 --> 00:57:04,716
They all were really upset.

926
00:57:05,977 --> 00:57:07,982
I was on my way home,

927
00:57:08,006 --> 00:57:10,926
then I saw you here,
drinking all alone.

928
00:57:13,946 --> 00:57:15,227
Director Ko.

929
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:18,797
You must be really upset.

930
00:57:21,227 --> 00:57:22,466
Ji Young.

931
00:57:23,127 --> 00:57:24,506
Don't worry.

932
00:57:25,296 --> 00:57:27,176
I'll make sure to sort things out...

933
00:57:27,366 --> 00:57:29,006
and finish our project.

934
00:57:29,397 --> 00:57:32,877
So you should just focus
on your acting.

935
00:57:34,937 --> 00:57:37,547
I'm so sorry
about what you're going through.

936
00:57:38,776 --> 00:57:41,087
I wish I could help you,

937
00:57:41,276 --> 00:57:43,056
but there's nothing I can do.

938
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:46,252
You don't have to worry though.

939
00:57:46,276 --> 00:57:49,322
All the staff members and actors
are of one mind.

940
00:57:49,346 --> 00:57:51,527
You're out, we are out too.

941
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:55,337
So please stay strong.

942
00:57:58,826 --> 00:58:00,207
Thank you.

943
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:03,207
Now that I have you on my side,

944
00:58:03,567 --> 00:58:04,846
I feel a lot better.

945
00:58:19,417 --> 00:58:20,656
What?

946
00:58:21,886 --> 00:58:23,926
Why is she alone with Ko Pil Seung?

947
00:58:32,656 --> 00:58:34,107
Where are you, Ji Young?

948
00:58:34,397 --> 00:58:35,906
Let's meet up later tonight.

949
00:58:35,966 --> 00:58:37,477
We can have dinner together.

950
00:59:03,326 --> 00:59:04,866
I'm sorry, but not tonight.

951
00:59:04,997 --> 00:59:07,277
I have to go home early
because of my grandma.

952
00:59:07,466 --> 00:59:09,043
We can have dinner tomorrow.

953
00:59:09,067 --> 00:59:10,636
I ate a lot.

954
00:59:10,636 --> 00:59:12,207
Did you?

955
00:59:16,267 --> 00:59:18,547
Mr. Gong, this way.

956
00:59:33,557 --> 00:59:34,866
Mr. Gong?

957
00:59:38,727 --> 00:59:41,877
Ji Young, why are you home so late?

958
00:59:42,466 --> 00:59:44,406
You said you have to go home early
because of your grandma.

959
00:59:48,567 --> 00:59:50,047
You drank.

960
00:59:51,307 --> 00:59:52,687
Who did you drink with?

961
00:59:53,377 --> 00:59:56,457
Well... With the staff members
and actors.

962
00:59:57,477 --> 00:59:58,727
Hey, Kim Ji Young.

963
00:59:59,216 --> 01:00:01,027
Why are you lying to me?

964
01:00:01,386 --> 01:00:03,567
I know you were with Ko Pil Seung.

965
01:00:03,886 --> 01:00:05,096
What?

966
01:00:05,156 --> 01:00:07,437
Why are you seeing someone else
when we're together?

967
01:00:07,826 --> 01:00:09,297
Are you playing double?

968
01:00:09,486 --> 01:00:12,127
Gosh, no. It's not like that.

969
01:00:12,127 --> 01:00:15,036
Then why did you lie to me?
And why did you meet Ko Pil Seung?

970
01:00:15,627 --> 01:00:17,877
Something huge happened today.

971
01:00:17,997 --> 01:00:19,736
They said
they would fire Director Ko...

972
01:00:19,736 --> 01:00:21,277
and shut down the studio.

973
01:00:21,837 --> 01:00:25,813
So I wanted to comfort him
as a colleague.

974
01:00:25,837 --> 01:00:27,056
My gosh.

975
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:29,986
Why would you comfort him?

976
01:00:30,176 --> 01:00:32,127
I'm the one
you should be comforting.

977
01:00:32,647 --> 01:00:35,022
I'm your boyfriend, Ji Young.

978
01:00:35,046 --> 01:00:38,333
Director Ko is someone I work with,
so I can't just turn a blind eye.

979
01:00:38,357 --> 01:00:40,096
But I don't like it.

980
01:00:40,426 --> 01:00:43,297
I don't want you
to spend a second with him.

981
01:00:47,826 --> 01:00:49,076
Okay.

982
01:00:50,466 --> 01:00:51,747
I'm sorry.

983
01:00:53,067 --> 01:00:54,477
You get it?

984
01:00:55,506 --> 01:00:56,886
All right then.

985
01:00:59,437 --> 01:01:02,056
By the way, Mr. Gong,

986
01:01:03,346 --> 01:01:05,127
I have something to tell you.

987
01:01:06,076 --> 01:01:08,517
What is it? Do you need new clothes?

988
01:01:08,517 --> 01:01:09,747
Do you want a necklace?

989
01:01:09,747 --> 01:01:12,127
Just tell me if you need anything.

990
01:01:12,457 --> 01:01:14,366
It's nothing like that.

991
01:01:16,997 --> 01:01:20,707
Don't you think this is just wrong?

992
01:01:20,966 --> 01:01:22,767
The drama is going on air soon.

993
01:01:22,767 --> 01:01:25,873
All the staff members
and actors are working really hard.

994
01:01:25,897 --> 01:01:28,006
They can't just fire the director...

995
01:01:28,006 --> 01:01:31,716
and tell us to stop the shoot
because of the family issue.

996
01:01:31,877 --> 01:01:35,386
It will only demoralize
the people involved in the project.

997
01:01:36,076 --> 01:01:38,886
Mr. Gong,
please don't let this happen.

998
01:01:39,747 --> 01:01:41,326
Wait, Ji Young.

999
01:01:41,616 --> 01:01:43,767
What are you talking about?
You're way out of line.

1000
01:01:44,386 --> 01:01:47,136
This isn't
just about a family issue.

1001
01:01:47,486 --> 01:01:48,732
Ko Pil Seung...

1002
01:01:48,756 --> 01:01:51,067
was hired through his connection
with Jang Soo Yeon.

1003
01:01:51,096 --> 01:01:52,466
So he should be fired.

1004
01:01:52,926 --> 01:01:57,006
To tell the truth, he wasn't hired
through the connection.

1005
01:01:57,897 --> 01:01:59,937
Everyone knows...

1006
01:01:59,937 --> 01:02:02,707
that Director Ko is competent
in his work.

1007
01:02:02,707 --> 01:02:06,116
All the staff members
respect and follow Director Ko.

1008
01:02:06,377 --> 01:02:07,616
Ji Young!

1009
01:02:07,747 --> 01:02:09,587
Just agree with what I say!

1010
01:02:10,116 --> 01:02:12,522
Are you trying
to defend him to me again?

1011
01:02:12,546 --> 01:02:15,486
- You darn jerk! You brat!
- My gosh.

1012
01:02:15,486 --> 01:02:18,317
How dare you yell
at my granddaughter?

1013
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:19,687
- What?
- You jerk.

1014
01:02:19,687 --> 01:02:22,002
- Grandma.
- I'm going to kill you today.

1015
01:02:22,026 --> 01:02:23,457
- I will end your life.
- What's with this lady?

1016
01:02:23,457 --> 01:02:24,627
- What?
- Gosh.

1017
01:02:24,627 --> 01:02:27,603
Grandma,
why are you being like this?

1018
01:02:27,627 --> 01:02:29,873
Stop it. Okay?

1019
01:02:29,897 --> 01:02:32,037
<i>- Until the day</i>
- What?

1020
01:02:32,037 --> 01:02:34,136
<i>The East Sea runs dry</i>

1021
01:02:34,136 --> 01:02:37,276
<i>- And Mount Baekdu is worn away</i>
- What's wrong with her?

1022
01:02:37,276 --> 01:02:38,977
Is this lady senile?

1023
01:02:38,977 --> 01:02:41,906
- My grandma isn't senile.
<i>- May the deities protect our nation</i>

1024
01:02:41,906 --> 01:02:45,986
<i>- Hurray to Korea</i>
- It's just that she has dementia.

1025
01:02:46,886 --> 01:02:48,087
You darn brat.

1026
01:02:48,087 --> 01:02:50,187
- Wait, Grandma.
- This is my granddaughter.

1027
01:02:50,187 --> 01:02:52,287
How dare you
raise your voice at her?

1028
01:02:52,287 --> 01:02:54,433
- Why you...
- Grandma, please.

1029
01:02:54,457 --> 01:02:56,603
I'm sorry about this.

1030
01:02:56,627 --> 01:03:00,107
- You!
- Grandma, don't.

1031
01:03:00,296 --> 01:03:02,442
- My gosh.
- Gosh, I'm exhausted.

1032
01:03:02,466 --> 01:03:06,783
Anyway, where has Myung Dong
been wandering around?

1033
01:03:06,807 --> 01:03:08,506
She isn't helping out
at the restaurant,

1034
01:03:08,506 --> 01:03:11,307
and dealing with all those customers
has me exhausted.

1035
01:03:11,307 --> 01:03:13,212
Mom, guys, this is bad.

1036
01:03:13,236 --> 01:03:14,747
- What?
- It's bad for Pil Seung.

1037
01:03:14,747 --> 01:03:17,076
- Come and have a seat.
- What has gotten into you?

1038
01:03:17,076 --> 01:03:18,817
Why? What happened to him?

1039
01:03:18,817 --> 01:03:21,216
Why? What's going on with Pil Seung?

1040
01:03:21,216 --> 01:03:23,092
What is it? Spill it.

1041
01:03:23,116 --> 01:03:25,497
I met a writer I know,

1042
01:03:26,587 --> 01:03:29,163
and APP Group
shut down production...

1043
01:03:29,187 --> 01:03:31,402
and is threatening to fire Pil Seung.

1044
01:03:31,426 --> 01:03:32,966
- What?
- What?

1045
01:03:33,057 --> 01:03:34,627
(Director Ko Pil Seung)

1046
01:03:38,497 --> 01:03:39,636
(Bong Soo)

1047
01:03:41,807 --> 01:03:43,116
Hey, Bong Soo.

1048
01:03:45,207 --> 01:03:46,417
What?

1049
01:03:47,446 --> 01:03:49,716
Ms. Jang and Writer Kim as well?

1050
01:03:53,147 --> 01:03:54,357
All right.

1051
01:03:55,216 --> 01:03:56,966
Sure thing. I'll see you tomorrow.

1052
01:04:03,656 --> 01:04:06,603
Lift the ban
on Director Ko Pil Seung!

1053
01:04:06,627 --> 01:04:08,977
- Lift the ban!
- Lift the ban!

1054
01:04:10,067 --> 01:04:12,873
Lift the shutdown order on set!

1055
01:04:12,897 --> 01:04:15,176
- Lift the shutdown order!
- Lift the shutdown order!

1056
01:04:15,707 --> 01:04:18,013
Dismiss CEO Gong Jin Dan!

1057
01:04:18,037 --> 01:04:20,116
- Dismiss him!
- Dismiss him!

1058
01:04:20,776 --> 01:04:23,283
Lift the shutdown order on set.

1059
01:04:23,307 --> 01:04:25,353
- Lift the shutdown order!
- Lift the shutdown order!

1060
01:04:25,377 --> 01:04:27,563
Dismiss CEO Gong Jin Dan!

1061
01:04:27,587 --> 01:04:29,696
- Dismiss him!
- Dismiss him!

1062
01:04:34,127 --> 01:04:35,366
Hey.

1063
01:04:36,087 --> 01:04:37,437
Remove them.

1064
01:04:38,497 --> 01:04:40,296
- What?
- Stop it.

1065
01:04:40,296 --> 01:04:42,326
- Don't.
- Don't you dare.

1066
01:04:42,326 --> 01:04:44,806
- What are you doing?
- Don't you dare.

1067
01:04:44,966 --> 01:04:46,567
- Let go of me.
- Let go!

1068
01:04:46,567 --> 01:04:48,107
- Stop it.
- Let go of her!

1069
01:04:48,107 --> 01:04:50,377
- Move.
- Get off me.

1070
01:04:50,377 --> 01:04:52,136
- Don't you dare.
- Stop!

1071
01:04:52,136 --> 01:04:53,922
- Let go.
- Remove them.

1072
01:04:53,946 --> 01:04:55,187
Let go of her!

1073
01:04:55,977 --> 01:04:58,393
- Grab him.
- Get your hands off me.

1074
01:04:58,417 --> 01:05:00,056
- Let go.
- Move!

1075
01:05:02,147 --> 01:05:03,393
Director?

1076
01:05:03,417 --> 01:05:05,196
Don't do this.

1077
01:05:09,727 --> 01:05:11,006
- Ji Young?
- Ji Young!

01:05:16,167 --> 01:05:18,866
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1079
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:52,817
How can we let this slide?

1080
01:05:52,817 --> 01:05:54,518
Pil Seung was wrongfully terminated,

1081
01:05:54,518 --> 01:05:56,218
and his crew is protesting in tears.

1082
01:05:56,218 --> 01:05:57,737
How can we not do anything?

1083
01:05:57,888 --> 01:05:59,388
I hate this.

1084
01:05:59,388 --> 01:06:00,758
Did we do something wrong?

1085
01:06:00,758 --> 01:06:02,457
Did Pil Seung do anything wrong?

1086
01:06:02,457 --> 01:06:04,268
Why must we suffer because of it?

1087
01:06:04,268 --> 01:06:06,567
It's all right. I'll make sure
to wrap up the situation well,

1088
01:06:06,567 --> 01:06:07,638
so don't worry too much.

1089
01:06:07,638 --> 01:06:09,797
Is there anything left
for us to talk about?

1090
01:06:09,797 --> 01:06:11,707
I don't want to see you again,
so leave.

1091
01:06:11,707 --> 01:06:13,718
I'm closing GOGO Entertainment down.

1092
01:06:14,377 --> 01:06:15,803
