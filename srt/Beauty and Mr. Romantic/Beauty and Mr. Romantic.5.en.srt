1
00:00:00,107 --> 00:00:07,435
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:10,398 --> 00:00:11,908
Curly-haired Assistant Director.

3
00:00:12,608 --> 00:00:13,669
Yes?

4
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:16,379
Have we...

5
00:00:17,508 --> 00:00:19,449
met before?

6
00:00:20,678 --> 00:00:21,818
We have, haven't we?

7
00:00:23,078 --> 00:00:24,079
Sorry?

8
00:00:25,389 --> 00:00:26,889
- Yes.
- Where?

9
00:00:26,889 --> 00:00:29,989
Well, I saw you
numerous times on TV.

10
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:31,989
In TV commercials and drama series.

11
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:36,128
I'm the average guy,
so people ask me that all the time.

12
00:00:36,128 --> 00:00:37,698
I'm sure that had you confused.

13
00:00:38,099 --> 00:00:39,128
Is that so?

14
00:00:46,369 --> 00:00:48,378
Darn, that was close.

15
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:52,249
I almost told her
I used to be Ko Dae Chung.

16
00:00:53,448 --> 00:00:56,479
Anyway, it doesn't feel right
to pretend not to know her.

17
00:00:57,418 --> 00:00:58,749
Should I just come clean?

18
00:00:59,749 --> 00:01:01,619
No, it's better this way.

19
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,189
Does Do Ra...

20
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:09,028
still remember me
from back in the day?

21
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:14,998
Come on. Let's have some fun.

22
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:16,869
Here. Bring on the drinks.

23
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:26,808
I bet that's what you learned
from your mom growing up.

24
00:01:26,808 --> 00:01:28,578
Your mom went around...

25
00:01:28,578 --> 00:01:30,479
wining and dining people
to get you a role.

26
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,248
Everyone in this field knows that!

27
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:34,858
Cho Bi Bi.

28
00:01:35,418 --> 00:01:36,789
You threw a knife at my heart,

29
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:38,388
so get ready to have
your heart broken as well.

30
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:40,588
Just you wait, Bi Bi.

31
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:51,808
- Bong Soo.
- Hey.

32
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:53,638
How about a drink?

33
00:01:53,769 --> 00:01:55,338
Hey, Pil Seung.

34
00:02:08,588 --> 00:02:09,659
Park Do Ra.

35
00:02:11,188 --> 00:02:13,528
Now that I got to take
a closer look at you,

36
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:16,599
I realize that you have
the prettiest eyes.

37
00:02:17,828 --> 00:02:19,599
Your eyes
are the darkest shade of black.

38
00:02:21,198 --> 00:02:23,668
What happens
if I lose myself in them?

39
00:02:24,768 --> 00:02:26,108
Will I be able to swim out of there?

40
00:02:27,768 --> 00:02:29,509
Thanks for saying I look pretty.

41
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:33,048
Sitting next to you this close...

42
00:02:33,548 --> 00:02:35,319
has my heart skipping a beat.

43
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:37,879
Do I make you nervous?

44
00:02:38,618 --> 00:02:40,888
Any woman would be nervous
to be this close to you.

45
00:02:42,358 --> 00:02:44,018
You see,
you're the reason I agreed...

46
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:46,129
to do "Straightforward Romance."

47
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:48,729
Me?

48
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:49,729
Yes.

49
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:51,868
I was thinking about taking a break,

50
00:02:51,868 --> 00:02:53,928
but then I was told
you were the male lead.

51
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:55,738
That's why I agreed to it.

52
00:02:56,638 --> 00:02:59,569
You've always been my type.

53
00:03:02,138 --> 00:03:03,208
Hey.

54
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:05,249
- Do Ra, what are you doing?
- Really?

55
00:03:06,108 --> 00:03:07,608
Am I your type?

56
00:03:08,178 --> 00:03:09,849
That's what I said.

57
00:03:11,749 --> 00:03:14,659
But now we'll be in the same show...

58
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:17,618
playing a couple.

59
00:03:18,358 --> 00:03:19,858
It's like my dream came true.

60
00:03:21,428 --> 00:03:22,428
Really?

61
00:03:23,198 --> 00:03:25,698
Well, just so you know,

62
00:03:26,668 --> 00:03:29,638
I've always
had my eyes on you as well.

63
00:03:31,668 --> 00:03:32,668
So...

64
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:37,608
how about we get together?

65
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,208
What?

66
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:43,879
Bong Soo, come on.
You shouldn't be like this.

67
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:46,418
I heard you were seeing someone.

68
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:52,289
Bong Soo.

69
00:03:53,328 --> 00:03:55,759
Do you know
who I hate the most in this world?

70
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,198
Two-timers.

71
00:04:00,529 --> 00:04:03,999
I hope you're not someone
who cheats on his girlfriend.

72
00:04:04,809 --> 00:04:07,208
Come on. Of course not.

73
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:09,078
I hate two-timers myself.

74
00:04:10,578 --> 00:04:12,809
Okay. Do Ra,

75
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:16,819
I heard you loud and clear.

76
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,418
That being said, let's drink to that.

77
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:20,988
Cheers.

78
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:24,418
Goodness.

79
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:26,358
Park Do Ra, that minx.

80
00:04:27,188 --> 00:04:29,558
Didn't she tell us
she hated Cha Bong Soo's guts?

81
00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:34,269
They have to play a couple,

82
00:04:34,269 --> 00:04:35,469
so it's good
that they're getting along.

83
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:38,539
You practically forced them
to be on better terms.

84
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,678
She truly is a professional.

85
00:04:41,678 --> 00:04:45,378
There's a reason
everyone wants to work with her.

86
00:04:45,378 --> 00:04:47,649
We won't have to worry
about our show anymore...

87
00:04:47,649 --> 00:04:49,649
since the two of them
are hitting it off on day one.

88
00:04:57,858 --> 00:04:59,589
That was unbelievable.

89
00:05:00,988 --> 00:05:02,659
What's with Do Ra?

90
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:05,399
She's out of her mind.
She has completely lost it.

91
00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:07,969
She's not the same Park Do Ra
I used to know.

92
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:10,969
Whatever.

93
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:12,409
It's not like she's my little sister.

94
00:05:12,969 --> 00:05:15,579
Whether she drinks with Cha Bong Soo
or feeds him cherries...

95
00:05:16,308 --> 00:05:18,008
is none of my business.

96
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:21,719
Darn it!

97
00:05:25,048 --> 00:05:26,688
- Isn't it good?
- It's delicious.

98
00:05:26,688 --> 00:05:28,488
- Have your fill.
- That's nice and sweet.

99
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,258
I'm home.

100
00:05:30,618 --> 00:05:32,358
- Goodness.
- Come on in.

101
00:05:32,358 --> 00:05:34,659
Pil Seung, you came home
at the right second.

102
00:05:34,798 --> 00:05:37,029
Take a seat and have
some sweet red bean porridge.

103
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:38,729
- What? Sweet red bean porridge?
- Yes.

104
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:39,798
Is it a special occasion?

105
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:43,199
Here you go.

106
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:45,769
It's hot, so take your time.

107
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:49,479
Sweet red bean porridge,
it's been so long.

108
00:05:50,008 --> 00:05:51,849
It must taste good today
because we haven't had it in a while.

109
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:53,878
I like that it isn't too sweet.
Don't you agree, Pil Seung?

110
00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:55,279
Yes, Auntie.

111
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:57,318
The sweet red bean porridge
melts all the stress away.

112
00:05:58,188 --> 00:05:59,188
What?

113
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:01,349
Who's calling at this hour?

114
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,229
My friend.

115
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:08,758
Hey, Hye Sook.

116
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:13,769
Right, but it's too bad.

117
00:06:14,269 --> 00:06:17,769
Pil Seung isn't interested
in dating at the moment.

118
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:21,979
Things must be hectic
at the broadcasting station...

119
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:23,878
because he wants to focus
on his work.

120
00:06:24,608 --> 00:06:28,048
That's right.
It's too bad, but what can we do?

121
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:31,318
Thank you for going the extra mile.

122
00:06:31,318 --> 00:06:32,988
Sure, we'll hang up.

123
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,959
Was Pil Seung offered a blind date?

124
00:06:36,289 --> 00:06:38,459
Who was the young lady
to make you turn the offer down...

125
00:06:38,459 --> 00:06:40,258
without even asking him?

126
00:06:40,258 --> 00:06:44,058
The daughter of my friend's cousin
works at a bank.

127
00:06:44,058 --> 00:06:45,599
When she heard
about Pil Seung's job,

128
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:47,428
she offered to set them up
on a blind date.

129
00:06:47,798 --> 00:06:49,199
But I turned it down.

130
00:06:49,298 --> 00:06:50,699
Come on.

131
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:54,068
Someone working at a bank
is a great catch in the dating pool.

132
00:06:54,339 --> 00:06:55,639
- Grandma.
- Yes?

133
00:06:55,779 --> 00:06:57,209
I'm not interested in dating
at the moment.

134
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:58,449
I don't have the time for that.

135
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:00,008
That's right, Pil Seung.

136
00:07:00,008 --> 00:07:02,048
Just focus on your job for now.

137
00:07:02,719 --> 00:07:04,779
Once you get promoted to director,

138
00:07:04,988 --> 00:07:06,548
Soo Yeon said she'd set you up...

139
00:07:06,548 --> 00:07:08,889
with a young lady
from a great family down the road.

140
00:07:09,758 --> 00:07:11,358
What's that supposed to mean?

141
00:07:11,358 --> 00:07:15,128
Is that your friend
from that rich family?

142
00:07:15,128 --> 00:07:18,029
Yes, she made
a pinky promise with me...

143
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:21,668
to set Pil Seung up
with a young lady from a nice family.

144
00:07:21,668 --> 00:07:23,139
My goodness.

145
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:26,469
That rich friend of yours
made a pinky promise with you?

146
00:07:26,808 --> 00:07:30,178
What if Pil Seung gets to marry...

147
00:07:30,178 --> 00:07:31,949
into a rich family himself?

148
00:07:32,378 --> 00:07:34,649
Guys, stop
getting ahead of yourselves.

149
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:37,178
Besides, why should Soo Yeon
set me up with anyone?

150
00:07:37,318 --> 00:07:39,548
I'll find the woman
who's right for me,

151
00:07:39,548 --> 00:07:42,418
so please mind your business
when it comes to my dating life.

152
00:07:43,118 --> 00:07:44,488
How can we mind our business...

153
00:07:44,488 --> 00:07:46,488
when so many men ruined their lives...

154
00:07:46,488 --> 00:07:47,858
after meeting the wrong woman?

155
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:49,899
Always be careful
when it comes to women.

156
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:51,428
Heed that warning.

157
00:07:51,969 --> 00:07:55,199
Mom, don't worry
about things like that.

158
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,738
Dating women
isn't a priority for me...

159
00:07:56,738 --> 00:07:57,938
at the moment.

160
00:07:57,938 --> 00:07:59,139
It doesn't matter
how careful you are.

161
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:01,779
You'll ruin your life
if you meet the wrong woman.

162
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:03,678
- That reminds me.
- Yes?

163
00:08:03,678 --> 00:08:06,108
This happened to a rich family
in a friend of my friend's neighborhood.

164
00:08:06,108 --> 00:08:09,378
A woman came saying
she was pregnant with their son's baby.

165
00:08:09,878 --> 00:08:11,748
They had no choice
but to let them marry.

166
00:08:11,748 --> 00:08:14,019
But the more they thought about it,
the less it made sense.

167
00:08:14,318 --> 00:08:15,589
Why?

168
00:08:16,358 --> 00:08:17,719
Was the baby not his?

169
00:08:17,818 --> 00:08:18,988
It wasn't that.

170
00:08:19,358 --> 00:08:22,428
The mom had taught the son well
about how to use contraception,

171
00:08:22,428 --> 00:08:24,699
and the man was really very careful.

172
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:26,729
They couldn't figure out
how the woman got pregnant.

173
00:08:27,428 --> 00:08:30,168
It turned out that the sly woman...

174
00:08:30,168 --> 00:08:32,068
poked holes in the condom
so she'd get pregnant...

175
00:08:32,068 --> 00:08:35,238
and marry into a rich family.

176
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:37,339
What? My goodness.

177
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:38,608
- That's gross.
- Mom.

178
00:08:38,608 --> 00:08:39,649
Sun Young.

179
00:08:39,908 --> 00:08:40,979
What?

180
00:08:41,449 --> 00:08:42,878
It's true.

181
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:45,189
- Goodness.
- That's unbelievable.

182
00:09:04,368 --> 00:09:05,439
I raise you.

183
00:09:05,908 --> 00:09:07,169
Come on.

184
00:09:08,309 --> 00:09:10,638
Why raise when you're out of ammo?

185
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:12,679
Go all-in with what you have.

186
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:15,919
Hey. Why don't I have ammo?

187
00:09:16,778 --> 00:09:18,388
Do you know how much this is worth?

188
00:09:18,549 --> 00:09:19,618
All-in.

189
00:09:19,618 --> 00:09:21,518
Okay. Call.

190
00:09:27,258 --> 00:09:29,429
Let's see your hand.

191
00:09:31,929 --> 00:09:32,929
Hey.

192
00:09:34,469 --> 00:09:36,898
Just a moment.

193
00:09:44,878 --> 00:09:46,248
Oh, well.

194
00:09:47,049 --> 00:09:48,518
That was fun.

195
00:09:49,979 --> 00:09:51,049
Hey!

196
00:09:52,419 --> 00:09:53,719
Bring some cash.

197
00:09:54,118 --> 00:09:56,089
Give me a loan.

198
00:10:18,878 --> 00:10:19,979
What was that?

199
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:21,679
Not that dream again.

200
00:10:22,248 --> 00:10:24,349
I already have a lot on my mind,

201
00:10:24,349 --> 00:10:27,589
and he keeps showing up,
making me feel worse.

202
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:29,518
I can't stand the darned old fool.

203
00:10:29,689 --> 00:10:32,089
When will he leave me alone?

204
00:10:32,258 --> 00:10:36,128
When will he stop
harassing me in my sleep?

205
00:10:37,898 --> 00:10:41,429
I need to pay at least the interest
on the money I borrowed next month.

206
00:10:44,038 --> 00:10:47,469
If we were to lose this house
or the Cheongdam-dong building,

207
00:10:48,038 --> 00:10:49,939
Do Ra wouldn't forgive me.

208
00:10:50,408 --> 00:10:51,479
Oh, no.

209
00:10:52,349 --> 00:10:54,508
What should I do?

210
00:10:54,809 --> 00:10:57,179
What am I to do?

211
00:10:57,248 --> 00:10:59,388
What do I do?

212
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:04,089
Gong Jin Dan.

213
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:07,258
You can't afford
to exercise right now.

214
00:11:07,528 --> 00:11:08,758
We need to talk.

215
00:11:10,229 --> 00:11:12,199
What do you want to
talk about now? Later.

216
00:11:12,368 --> 00:11:13,469
I have to shower and go to work.

217
00:11:13,628 --> 00:11:15,238
Jeil Steel's chairman's daughter.

218
00:11:15,238 --> 00:11:17,469
Did you really tell her
you met someone fatefully?

219
00:11:17,738 --> 00:11:20,339
If you didn't like her, that's fine,
but did you have to talk nonsense?

220
00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:22,378
How could you say that
on a blind date?

221
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:23,908
What will you do now?

222
00:11:24,138 --> 00:11:25,608
You need rich in-laws at least...

223
00:11:25,608 --> 00:11:28,819
so you can force your brother
to hand over Angel Investments.

224
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:31,079
Just wait, Mom.

225
00:11:31,449 --> 00:11:33,089
I met a pretty decent woman.

226
00:11:33,449 --> 00:11:36,488
She's fabulous
and the Jeil Steel girl is no match.

227
00:11:36,758 --> 00:11:38,729
What? Is that true?

228
00:11:39,189 --> 00:11:40,329
You didn't lie?

229
00:11:40,488 --> 00:11:42,128
Who are the girl's parents?

230
00:11:42,628 --> 00:11:44,329
How rich are they?
Richer than Jeil Steel?

231
00:11:46,569 --> 00:11:48,998
I can't tell you that now.
I'll tell you everything later.

232
00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:50,939
When is later?

233
00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:52,309
Can't you tell me now?

234
00:11:52,368 --> 00:11:53,868
I'm dead curious.

235
00:11:53,939 --> 00:11:56,079
Will you just wait?

236
00:11:56,408 --> 00:11:57,839
I'm off to shower.

237
00:12:00,648 --> 00:12:03,878
I knew it.
Jin Dan isn't that thoughtless.

238
00:12:05,518 --> 00:12:06,648
Anyway,

239
00:12:07,549 --> 00:12:09,319
we need to take
Angel Investments soon...

240
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:12,089
so Jin Dan won't look too shabby
around his future in-laws.

241
00:12:14,158 --> 00:12:15,429
My goodness.

242
00:12:16,158 --> 00:12:17,329
Ma Ri.

243
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:20,528
What were you doing,
standing there so quietly?

244
00:12:21,528 --> 00:12:23,199
Were you eavesdropping like a ghost?

245
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:29,508
Mom, the mistress
is trying to take Angel Investments!

246
00:12:32,608 --> 00:12:35,949
Jin Dan, is it true you invested in
a drama production?

247
00:12:38,748 --> 00:12:39,788
Yes.

248
00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:42,118
Goodness, Jin Dan.

249
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:43,719
Why would you do
something like that?

250
00:12:44,819 --> 00:12:46,189
What do you mean?

251
00:12:46,189 --> 00:12:48,699
People invest a lot
in content these days.

252
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:53,528
You must see the big picture
and invest in what will profit.

253
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:57,299
Don't waste money
or energy for no reason.

254
00:12:57,998 --> 00:12:59,008
Jin Taek.

255
00:12:59,408 --> 00:13:02,108
It's true that I did nothing
but disappoint you so far.

256
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:05,679
But trust me with it for a while.

257
00:13:06,549 --> 00:13:07,949
I'll make it work somehow.

258
00:13:11,849 --> 00:13:12,988
I'm off to work.

259
00:13:23,258 --> 00:13:25,569
Jin Taek. No, Chairman Gong.

260
00:13:26,929 --> 00:13:28,738
The Korean Wave is a huge deal.

261
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:31,099
Our dramas, movies, and music.

262
00:13:31,099 --> 00:13:33,238
K-contents are popular
all around the world.

263
00:13:33,408 --> 00:13:35,839
I'm sure Jin Dan has
a plan of his own.

264
00:13:37,508 --> 00:13:38,748
Mom, Dad.

265
00:13:38,849 --> 00:13:41,608
Does Angel Investments
belong to Uncle?

266
00:13:42,748 --> 00:13:43,819
Goodness.

267
00:13:46,488 --> 00:13:47,589
Ma Ri.

268
00:13:49,358 --> 00:13:51,589
Why would you ask?
You don't need to know about that.

269
00:13:52,028 --> 00:13:54,229
Mom. I know some things too.

270
00:13:54,229 --> 00:13:55,528
Don't treat me like a fool.

271
00:13:56,258 --> 00:13:59,229
Dad said everything
this family owns was mine.

272
00:13:59,229 --> 00:14:02,339
You said I was your successor.

273
00:14:02,538 --> 00:14:05,138
So I should know everything.
Right, Dad?

274
00:14:06,008 --> 00:14:08,569
Yes, that's right.

275
00:14:09,579 --> 00:14:12,878
I'll explain everything to you
slowly and bit by bit.

276
00:14:14,378 --> 00:14:17,979
Today, will you come to work with me
since you haven't in a while?

277
00:14:18,349 --> 00:14:20,018
Yes. I'd like that.

278
00:14:25,729 --> 00:14:27,488
Were you that thirsty?

279
00:14:27,858 --> 00:14:29,528
Was the tour boring?

280
00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:30,729
Yes.

281
00:14:31,729 --> 00:14:35,128
Dad. Your work is not fun at all.

282
00:14:35,128 --> 00:14:37,699
How do you manage to work
every day without a break?

283
00:14:39,538 --> 00:14:40,939
I think it's fun.

284
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:42,778
And I must work hard.

285
00:14:42,778 --> 00:14:45,309
So many people's lives
depend on the company.

286
00:14:47,349 --> 00:14:49,679
Responsibility? Sense of duty?

287
00:14:49,849 --> 00:14:51,719
Ma Ri. Did you see that?

288
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,018
Our Ma Ri is a genius.

289
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,589
You have a great brain.

290
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:59,229
I told you that...

291
00:14:59,758 --> 00:15:01,158
I knew what there was to know.

292
00:15:03,998 --> 00:15:05,528
What am I doing?

293
00:15:06,229 --> 00:15:08,868
Oh, no. I just messed up my diet.

294
00:15:10,498 --> 00:15:12,569
This much is fine.

295
00:15:12,569 --> 00:15:14,939
You're slim and pretty as you are.

296
00:15:14,939 --> 00:15:16,309
You don't need to lose weight.

297
00:15:16,309 --> 00:15:17,479
Yes, Ma Ri.

298
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:20,549
Why go on a diet
when you're perfectly beautiful?

299
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,118
- I don't know. It's ruined.
- Where are you going?

300
00:15:24,118 --> 00:15:25,118
The toilet.

301
00:15:25,618 --> 00:15:26,788
I'll see myself out.

302
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:28,618
I hope everything's fine.
See you on set.

303
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:32,459
Hey.

304
00:15:34,488 --> 00:15:35,528
Hello.

305
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:38,229
Pil Seung.

306
00:15:39,628 --> 00:15:42,138
Honey. This is Sun Young's son.

307
00:15:42,768 --> 00:15:43,768
I see.

308
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:46,768
The young man from the funeral.

309
00:15:46,868 --> 00:15:48,608
Yes. How are you?

310
00:15:50,038 --> 00:15:53,248
You were a teenager then.
You're a grown young man now.

311
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:57,148
He works at a TV station
as a drama director.

312
00:15:57,148 --> 00:15:58,648
Oh, do you?

313
00:15:59,118 --> 00:16:01,349
I watch them when I have the time.

314
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,118
I hope you make some good ones.

315
00:16:03,358 --> 00:16:04,719
I will, sir.

316
00:16:06,288 --> 00:16:07,628
What were you doing here?

317
00:16:07,628 --> 00:16:10,329
I met some people for work
and was on my way out.

318
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:14,268
I'll let you chat.
I should get going.

319
00:16:14,268 --> 00:16:15,329
Goodbye.

320
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,368
Your friend Sun Young.

321
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:25,179
She must feel so reassured
to have a son like that.

322
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:27,709
Yes.

323
00:16:28,549 --> 00:16:29,679
She is.

324
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:35,518
- I'll go to the ladies' room too.
- Sure.

325
00:16:39,488 --> 00:16:40,888
Did he leave already?

326
00:16:41,288 --> 00:16:43,599
Okay,
I'll talk to them for you. Bye.

327
00:16:45,768 --> 00:16:48,069
Hey. Why are you out here?

328
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:49,138
Hi.

329
00:16:49,138 --> 00:16:51,439
I came out to make a call.

330
00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:52,908
I see.

331
00:16:54,038 --> 00:16:56,709
We haven't met in a while
and you look a bit rough.

332
00:16:57,479 --> 00:16:58,979
You're not ill, are you?

333
00:16:59,408 --> 00:17:02,079
Why would I be?
I'm too healthy for my own good.

334
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:05,179
I neglected my skincare routine
because I was busy.

335
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:07,648
I should get a facial mask.

336
00:17:08,858 --> 00:17:09,888
Yes.

337
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:13,058
Even if you're busy,
look after yourself.

338
00:17:13,058 --> 00:17:14,189
And eat well too.

339
00:17:14,389 --> 00:17:16,598
I will. You look after yourself too.

340
00:17:17,159 --> 00:17:18,429
I will. Thanks.

341
00:17:20,528 --> 00:17:22,199
You should go. You seem busy.

342
00:17:22,568 --> 00:17:23,598
Okay.

343
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:35,748
The wine and flowers...

344
00:17:35,748 --> 00:17:38,778
are from Angel Investments'
Gong Jin Dan?

345
00:17:38,848 --> 00:17:41,318
Yes. Look at the business card.

346
00:17:41,619 --> 00:17:44,018
Do you really not know the guy?

347
00:17:44,389 --> 00:17:46,328
I really don't.

348
00:17:47,129 --> 00:17:48,788
I'm off to a shoot.

349
00:17:49,598 --> 00:17:51,659
Do Ra, wait.

350
00:17:52,028 --> 00:17:54,429
He invested in your drama...

351
00:17:54,429 --> 00:17:56,238
and sent a gift.

352
00:17:56,238 --> 00:17:58,098
You should say thank you.

353
00:17:58,469 --> 00:18:01,538
Can't you take care of
stuff like that for me?

354
00:18:02,109 --> 00:18:03,308
- Goodness.
- See you.

355
00:18:03,308 --> 00:18:05,038
- Okay. Take care.
- Bye.

356
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:06,548
- See you.
- Bye.

357
00:18:09,048 --> 00:18:12,449
Who on earth is Mr. Gong Jin Dan?

358
00:18:12,818 --> 00:18:15,348
Why is he being so nice to Do Ra?

359
00:18:15,959 --> 00:18:17,359
This is strange.

360
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:21,459
No way. Is it because...

361
00:18:21,459 --> 00:18:24,359
he's interested in Do Ra?

362
00:18:30,038 --> 00:18:33,139
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

363
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:42,619
Hello, Gong Jin Dan speaking.

364
00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:45,048
Hello, Mr. Gong.

365
00:18:45,048 --> 00:18:47,719
This is the CEO
of Dora Entertainment,

366
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:49,419
Baek Mi Ja.

367
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,558
I'm Actress Park Do Ra's mom.

368
00:18:52,729 --> 00:18:54,588
Hello, Ms. Baek.

369
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:57,659
You sent the wine and flowers...

370
00:18:57,659 --> 00:18:59,869
to our place, didn't you?

371
00:18:59,869 --> 00:19:00,929
Yes, I did.

372
00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:02,939
Do Ra starts shooting
the new drama today,

373
00:19:02,939 --> 00:19:04,338
so I sent them to show my support.

374
00:19:04,338 --> 00:19:06,639
That's such a thoughtful gesture,
Mr. Gong.

375
00:19:06,639 --> 00:19:09,439
I was going to give you a call anyway.

376
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,248
I was told
you gave your full support...

377
00:19:12,248 --> 00:19:14,508
so Do Ra could close the contact
with good terms.

378
00:19:14,508 --> 00:19:18,119
Thank you so much for everything.

379
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:20,988
It's my pleasure.
I'm a big fan of Actress Park Do Ra.

380
00:19:20,988 --> 00:19:23,359
I only invested the money
because I appreciated her talents.

381
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,359
Do you really mean that?

382
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:29,429
I wish Do Ra could hear
all your lovely compliments.

383
00:19:29,699 --> 00:19:31,998
Then could we meet up
for a meal sometime?

384
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:33,199
Of course.

385
00:19:33,199 --> 00:19:36,038
Anytime will do for us.

386
00:19:36,038 --> 00:19:39,709
Thank you, Mr. Gong. Goodbye.

387
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:45,709
I thought he'd be old,
but he sounds quite young.

388
00:19:45,979 --> 00:19:47,548
Is he a young guy?

389
00:19:49,018 --> 00:19:52,488
I wonder what CEO Gong Jin Dan
of Angel Investments is like.

390
00:19:59,328 --> 00:20:01,129
What? I see.

391
00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:04,959
- We will do this scene first.
- Okay.

392
00:20:09,298 --> 00:20:11,369
- Hey.
- Jin Gu.

393
00:20:11,498 --> 00:20:13,538
We have a problem.
At the alley entrance,

394
00:20:13,538 --> 00:20:15,409
there was a car accident,
and a truck collapsed.

395
00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:17,308
There's no way the sprinkler truck
can make it here.

396
00:20:17,909 --> 00:20:18,909
What?

397
00:20:19,578 --> 00:20:20,649
What do we do then?

398
00:20:22,048 --> 00:20:23,219
What do you want me to do?

399
00:20:25,018 --> 00:20:27,018
Ready, action.

400
00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:41,469
Gosh, it's cold.

401
00:20:41,768 --> 00:20:43,038
Cut. Wait.

402
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:44,098
Pil Seung!

403
00:20:44,338 --> 00:20:45,909
Can't you sprinkle the water right?

404
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:47,768
- Do it right.
- I'm sorry.

405
00:20:56,879 --> 00:20:58,479
Cut. We're doing it again.

406
00:20:58,949 --> 00:21:00,189
Why does it stop raining?

407
00:21:00,189 --> 00:21:02,088
Let me fill this with water again.

408
00:21:02,288 --> 00:21:03,459
Get me some water.

409
00:21:03,459 --> 00:21:05,488
If you run out of water,
you should fill it.

410
00:21:05,689 --> 00:21:07,189
I can't take care of everything.

411
00:21:07,328 --> 00:21:09,159
All right. Let's do it again.

412
00:21:21,109 --> 00:21:22,639
Cut. Okay.

413
00:21:32,488 --> 00:21:33,488
Thanks.

414
00:21:33,848 --> 00:21:36,859
Well... Do Ra. I was wondering...

415
00:21:36,859 --> 00:21:39,459
I understand that they couldn't
get the sprinkler truck here, but...

416
00:21:39,828 --> 00:21:40,988
- Listen, Bong Soo.
- What?

417
00:21:40,988 --> 00:21:43,298
I mean, we live in an age
when a trip to Mars is possible.

418
00:21:43,298 --> 00:21:45,229
And they're letting a man
sprinkle water with a watering can?

419
00:21:45,729 --> 00:21:47,169
What kind of shoot is this?

420
00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:50,238
It must be tough for
the assistant director and staff, right?

421
00:21:50,699 --> 00:21:53,738
Yes. I guess you're right.

422
00:21:53,738 --> 00:21:54,808
Let's move on to the next scene.

423
00:21:54,808 --> 00:21:56,139
Yes, Director Hong.

424
00:21:56,139 --> 00:21:57,879
Bong Soo, I'll go get changed.

425
00:21:57,879 --> 00:21:59,909
Okay. All right.

426
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:08,580
- By the way, do you need anything?
- I'll check something and go there.

427
00:22:08,604 --> 00:22:10,005
- Something hot.
- Something hot?

428
00:22:10,005 --> 00:22:11,975
- Yes.
- Like a hot-iced Americano?

429
00:22:11,975 --> 00:22:13,045
What?

430
00:22:13,045 --> 00:22:14,745
All right. I'll be right back.

431
00:22:24,395 --> 00:22:25,796
Assistant Director Ko.

432
00:22:28,236 --> 00:22:29,266
Assistant Director Ko.

433
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:33,706
It must've been hard for you
to sprinkle water on us earlier.

434
00:22:35,036 --> 00:22:36,206
It was all right.

435
00:22:38,476 --> 00:22:39,575
What was that?

436
00:22:40,046 --> 00:22:42,246
I was trying to be nice,
but he didn't even care to look.

437
00:22:44,385 --> 00:22:45,946
What's with him?

438
00:22:48,016 --> 00:22:49,686
Is he upset?

439
00:22:54,395 --> 00:22:55,425
Darn it.

440
00:22:55,595 --> 00:22:56,796
Why is he coming again?

441
00:23:04,806 --> 00:23:05,806
Do Ra.

442
00:23:07,905 --> 00:23:08,905
What?

443
00:23:10,036 --> 00:23:12,105
Did you get my text message?

444
00:23:12,806 --> 00:23:14,415
I sent the address
of a Japanese restaurant.

445
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:16,716
The address
of a Japanese restaurant?

446
00:23:17,385 --> 00:23:18,786
No, I didn't see it.

447
00:23:18,786 --> 00:23:20,556
I put my phone on silent.

448
00:23:21,216 --> 00:23:23,786
We have only two scenes left today.

449
00:23:24,825 --> 00:23:26,085
I'll see you there.

450
00:23:27,456 --> 00:23:29,125
I booked a room.

451
00:23:29,726 --> 00:23:30,726
A room?

452
00:23:34,395 --> 00:23:36,796
The thing is,
something urgent has come up.

453
00:23:36,796 --> 00:23:38,706
I don't think
I can have dinner with you.

454
00:23:43,335 --> 00:23:44,375
Bong Soo.

455
00:23:45,345 --> 00:23:46,375
Listen.

456
00:23:47,476 --> 00:23:49,375
Hey! Park Do Ra, Cha Bong Soo!

457
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:51,885
What do you think you're doing
sitting that close to one another?

458
00:23:52,286 --> 00:23:54,615
Park Do Ra, you darn brat!

459
00:23:54,615 --> 00:23:55,855
- Is that Cho Bi Bi?
- Yes.

460
00:23:55,855 --> 00:23:57,486
Do Ra, I'm going to kill you!

461
00:23:57,486 --> 00:23:58,855
- Hey, Bi Bi.
- Please wait!

462
00:23:58,855 --> 00:24:00,655
- My gosh.
- Gosh, it hurts.

463
00:24:00,655 --> 00:24:02,625
- Please let go of this.
- Hey.

464
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:03,966
- It hurts.
- Move out of the way!

465
00:24:03,966 --> 00:24:05,466
- Bi Bi.
- Bi Bi, let go of it first.

466
00:24:05,466 --> 00:24:07,236
- Hey, Bi Bi.
- Let go of it.

467
00:24:07,236 --> 00:24:09,095
- My gosh.
- Bi Bi, let go.

468
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,306
- What's going on?
- What's that?

469
00:24:12,335 --> 00:24:13,466
Park Do Ra!

470
00:24:13,565 --> 00:24:15,675
You hit on Bong Soo first, right?

471
00:24:15,675 --> 00:24:16,776
You already took my job,

472
00:24:16,776 --> 00:24:18,546
and now you're stealing
a man from me?

473
00:24:18,546 --> 00:24:20,375
You darn wench!

474
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,276
Don't cause a scene on set...

475
00:24:22,276 --> 00:24:24,046
and please talk it out.

476
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:26,516
Cho Bi Bi,
what are you talking about?

477
00:24:26,915 --> 00:24:29,216
Nothing is going on
between Bong Soo and me.

478
00:24:29,355 --> 00:24:31,585
I'm not interested
in Bong Soo at all.

479
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:35,956
Nothing's going on?
You're not interested?

480
00:24:36,595 --> 00:24:37,696
Are you serious? Isn't it you?

481
00:24:37,696 --> 00:24:40,026
Of course not.
What are you talking about?

482
00:24:40,026 --> 00:24:42,496
There might be someone else.

483
00:24:43,936 --> 00:24:45,966
Hey, Cha Bong Soo.

484
00:24:46,466 --> 00:24:47,675
What happened?

485
00:24:47,675 --> 00:24:49,675
Who is it then?
Who made you dump me?

486
00:24:49,675 --> 00:24:51,645
You said
it was because of Park Do Ra!

487
00:24:58,046 --> 00:25:01,256
Do Ra, you have to say something.

488
00:25:01,256 --> 00:25:04,085
What am I supposed to say?

489
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:07,085
Bi Bi, it's not me. I'm telling you.

490
00:25:07,085 --> 00:25:08,556
There's no way
I'm interested in him.

491
00:25:09,026 --> 00:25:10,496
Hey, Cha Bong Soo.

492
00:25:11,395 --> 00:25:12,966
How can you do this to me?

493
00:25:13,266 --> 00:25:15,766
You could've just said
you didn't like me!

494
00:25:17,036 --> 00:25:18,506
You jerk!

495
00:25:19,266 --> 00:25:22,105
Hey, Bi Bi. Wait.

496
00:25:22,436 --> 00:25:24,976
Wait, Bi Bi. Listen to me.

497
00:25:24,976 --> 00:25:27,206
It's not like
I don't want to be with you.

498
00:25:27,206 --> 00:25:29,145
You darn scumbag!

499
00:25:29,815 --> 00:25:32,986
We're so over now!

500
00:26:04,946 --> 00:26:06,115
Hey, Park Do Ra.

501
00:26:07,686 --> 00:26:09,056
You sounded
as if you'd go out with me...

502
00:26:09,056 --> 00:26:10,585
if I broke up with Bi Bi.

503
00:26:11,526 --> 00:26:12,556
Why are you playing dumb?

504
00:26:13,556 --> 00:26:15,655
Why are you making a fool
out of me?

505
00:26:18,595 --> 00:26:20,466
When did I say that?

506
00:26:22,266 --> 00:26:25,165
I didn't say I'd go out with you.

507
00:26:25,536 --> 00:26:27,206
What are you talking about?

508
00:26:28,006 --> 00:26:29,605
You said you didn't want me
to be a cheater.

509
00:26:30,405 --> 00:26:32,276
That's why I broke up with Bi Bi!

510
00:26:32,276 --> 00:26:34,046
I didn't tell you
to break up with Bi Bi.

511
00:26:34,046 --> 00:26:36,115
I just said
I didn't like two-timing.

512
00:26:36,915 --> 00:26:39,286
That doesn't mean
I want to go out with you.

513
00:26:39,286 --> 00:26:41,456
I just told you
about what I didn't like.

514
00:26:42,585 --> 00:26:45,855
You said working with me
was like your dream came true.

515
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:48,625
I just meant
I was happy to work with you.

516
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:50,296
That doesn't mean
I have feelings for you.

517
00:26:52,565 --> 00:26:55,936
Come on. You're being funny.

518
00:26:56,335 --> 00:26:58,236
Don't be so melodramatic.

519
00:26:58,706 --> 00:26:59,736
Why you...

520
00:27:05,976 --> 00:27:07,006
Bong Soo.

521
00:27:08,645 --> 00:27:10,246
Did you just scream obscenities
at my face?

522
00:27:10,716 --> 00:27:11,716
That's right, you...

523
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:14,355
- Please don't.
- You foul-mouthed...

524
00:27:14,355 --> 00:27:16,115
- Are you done talking?
- What's the matter with you?

525
00:27:16,115 --> 00:27:17,686
- You heard her too.
- Say that again.

526
00:27:17,686 --> 00:27:19,855
- Do Ra, please.
- Get over here, darn it.

527
00:27:19,855 --> 00:27:22,496
- Are you done talking?
- Give me a hand!

528
00:27:22,625 --> 00:27:24,125
You good-for-nothing witch.
Get over here.

529
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:27,095
Director Hong,
I can't work with a goon like him.

530
00:27:27,095 --> 00:27:28,135
I refuse to work with him!

531
00:27:28,135 --> 00:27:30,296
How can one spit out
such obscenities?

532
00:27:30,296 --> 00:27:32,165
What? A goon?

533
00:27:32,165 --> 00:27:34,436
You're the thug and a goon.
Get over here.

534
00:27:34,436 --> 00:27:36,375
- Get over here.
- Did you call me a goon?

535
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:38,575
- Do Ra, please.
- You're the goon in this case.

536
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:40,405
- Get over here. Let me go.
- You goon!

537
00:27:40,405 --> 00:27:42,716
Have some respect for your seniors.
Get over here!

538
00:27:42,716 --> 00:27:44,246
- You goon.
- Hey!

539
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:46,216
Get back here!

540
00:27:47,716 --> 00:27:49,516
Let me go.

541
00:27:53,186 --> 00:27:56,125
What kind of a mess is this?

542
00:27:57,996 --> 00:27:59,625
Forget this.

543
00:28:00,065 --> 00:28:02,296
Pil Seung, wrap up today's filming.

544
00:28:02,565 --> 00:28:04,565
Wrap it up, darn it!

545
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:12,546
And shoots...

546
00:28:16,875 --> 00:28:18,546
Unbelievable.

547
00:28:19,686 --> 00:28:22,585
Being glued to your laptop
trying to write something...

548
00:28:22,815 --> 00:28:26,125
won't generate any money
or a man for that matter.

549
00:28:26,585 --> 00:28:28,956
Mom, don't talk to me.

550
00:28:33,165 --> 00:28:35,635
Mom, what's the matter with you?

551
00:28:35,736 --> 00:28:37,266
Not everyone can write
a decent screenplay.

552
00:28:37,936 --> 00:28:40,466
Give up on that pipe dream of yours.

553
00:28:41,075 --> 00:28:43,575
It's been a bust for ten years
which means there's no hope.

554
00:28:45,105 --> 00:28:47,645
Study for the state exam instead.

555
00:28:48,776 --> 00:28:50,845
You need to have something
going for you...

556
00:28:50,845 --> 00:28:53,585
to be set up on blind dates
and get married.

557
00:28:54,256 --> 00:28:57,756
Mom, please leave me be.

558
00:28:58,355 --> 00:29:00,355
Passing the state exam
is no walk in the park.

559
00:29:00,726 --> 00:29:03,226
You moron.

560
00:29:03,956 --> 00:29:05,496
Didn't you hear
what your sister-in-law said?

561
00:29:06,026 --> 00:29:08,996
I don't know whose daughter she is,
but she's cunning and smart.

562
00:29:09,065 --> 00:29:10,565
To marry into a rich family,

563
00:29:10,565 --> 00:29:12,335
she poked a hole in the condom.

564
00:29:13,065 --> 00:29:15,706
Meanwhile, you spend your days
glued to your laptop.

565
00:29:15,706 --> 00:29:18,375
How much longer
will you waste your time like this?

566
00:29:18,446 --> 00:29:19,506
Well...

567
00:29:21,315 --> 00:29:25,016
Poking holes in a condom...

568
00:29:25,446 --> 00:29:26,815
is a crime.

569
00:29:27,786 --> 00:29:29,115
Where's her pride?

570
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:31,556
I would never shackle
a man's ankles like that!

571
00:29:31,556 --> 00:29:33,026
Seriously?

572
00:29:33,325 --> 00:29:35,925
Try saying that
after you've been with men.

573
00:29:36,296 --> 00:29:39,625
Get out there
and go out with a random guy...

574
00:29:39,625 --> 00:29:41,835
rather than staying home
glued to your laptop.

575
00:29:42,766 --> 00:29:44,905
Myung Dong, come on.

576
00:29:45,006 --> 00:29:47,065
What if you reach 40 and 50,
and go through menopause?

577
00:29:47,065 --> 00:29:48,506
What will you do?

578
00:29:49,436 --> 00:29:51,776
You aging like this without a plan...

579
00:29:52,776 --> 00:29:56,075
is killing me inside.

580
00:29:57,716 --> 00:29:59,246
- Darn it!
- What?

581
00:30:00,046 --> 00:30:02,516
Don't think about coming home...

582
00:30:02,516 --> 00:30:04,855
until you have gotten together
with a man. Got it?

583
00:30:29,546 --> 00:30:30,546
Ju Hee.

584
00:30:31,415 --> 00:30:32,516
Marry me.

585
00:30:36,186 --> 00:30:39,825
Did you just ask me to marry you?

586
00:30:40,786 --> 00:30:42,556
- Me?
- Yes.

587
00:30:43,256 --> 00:30:44,665
What's wrong? Don't you want to?

588
00:30:44,966 --> 00:30:46,125
Of course I don't want to.

589
00:30:46,766 --> 00:30:49,365
I only just turned 23.

590
00:30:50,236 --> 00:30:52,006
Consider our age gap.

591
00:30:52,405 --> 00:30:53,536
Have you no conscience?

592
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:55,976
What?

593
00:30:56,175 --> 00:30:57,476
I dated you...

594
00:30:57,675 --> 00:30:59,575
because you were sweet
and were good to me.

595
00:31:00,075 --> 00:31:01,575
But this is more than burdening.

596
00:31:02,615 --> 00:31:05,145
Besides, I'm seeing someone new.

597
00:31:05,885 --> 00:31:07,446
That's why I asked to see you today.

598
00:31:30,006 --> 00:31:32,546
Fine. Leave me, darn it!

599
00:31:34,175 --> 00:31:35,446
I, Park Do Sik,

600
00:31:36,046 --> 00:31:37,915
will not stop a woman
from leaving me...

601
00:31:38,286 --> 00:31:40,016
or stop a woman
from approaching me!

602
00:31:42,686 --> 00:31:44,425
If that's what you want,

603
00:31:46,885 --> 00:31:48,925
leave me.

604
00:32:01,436 --> 00:32:04,375
What? What's this?

605
00:32:11,216 --> 00:32:12,645
Goodness.

606
00:32:13,145 --> 00:32:16,085
You sparkly little thing
are a pretty one.

607
00:32:17,726 --> 00:32:19,986
But where did you come from?

608
00:32:36,075 --> 00:32:37,436
Excuse me.

609
00:32:38,276 --> 00:32:41,175
Were you the one
who tossed this sparkly object?

610
00:32:42,575 --> 00:32:44,486
May I keep it?

611
00:32:44,746 --> 00:32:45,946
Sure. I...

612
00:32:46,885 --> 00:32:48,986
I threw it away,
so keep it if you want.

613
00:32:48,986 --> 00:32:51,726
In exchange,
can I have some of that?

614
00:32:56,026 --> 00:32:57,026
Let me get this straight.

615
00:32:57,026 --> 00:32:59,865
So that younger girl
rejected your proposal today?

616
00:33:00,796 --> 00:33:02,565
No way.

617
00:33:02,766 --> 00:33:05,635
It's like a scene
from a romantic comedy.

618
00:33:05,635 --> 00:33:07,806
Oh, my.

619
00:33:08,635 --> 00:33:11,605
What's so funny
when this is a serious matter for me?

620
00:33:11,976 --> 00:33:13,575
Just think about it.

621
00:33:13,776 --> 00:33:15,915
There's a man this handsome,

622
00:33:15,915 --> 00:33:18,345
but the girl rejected him
without batting an eye.

623
00:33:18,786 --> 00:33:22,016
This surely has to be a plot
from a romantic comedy.

624
00:33:22,786 --> 00:33:25,026
It's not some melodrama
one cries over.

625
00:33:25,186 --> 00:33:26,425
Don't you agree?

626
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:28,625
Right, a romantic comedy.

627
00:33:30,696 --> 00:33:33,165
Do you really think I'm handsome?

628
00:33:33,925 --> 00:33:36,065
Yes, you're super good-looking.

629
00:33:36,335 --> 00:33:37,766
If it had been me,

630
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:40,165
I wouldn't have rejected
a man like you...

631
00:33:40,536 --> 00:33:42,806
even if that meant crossing over
to a melodrama category.

632
00:33:45,506 --> 00:33:48,016
It seems as though we click.

633
00:33:49,046 --> 00:33:50,115
Right?

634
00:33:50,246 --> 00:33:54,085
It seems as though
the two of us click.

635
00:33:54,556 --> 00:33:56,016
So would you like to be friends?

636
00:33:56,016 --> 00:33:57,956
We'll be friends...

637
00:33:58,056 --> 00:34:00,726
and meet up every Wednesday.

638
00:34:01,726 --> 00:34:02,825
Friends?

639
00:34:03,956 --> 00:34:05,726
Okay, I'm down with that.

640
00:34:07,425 --> 00:34:09,036
Here. Give me your number.

641
00:34:09,365 --> 00:34:10,365
Sure.

642
00:34:11,335 --> 00:34:14,135
Let's see. 010...

643
00:34:14,436 --> 00:34:15,575
There.

644
00:34:17,635 --> 00:34:18,706
Right.

645
00:34:19,806 --> 00:34:21,045
Then,

646
00:34:21,376 --> 00:34:23,416
since we became friends...

647
00:34:25,786 --> 00:34:29,186
On Wednesdays,
let there be red roses!

648
00:34:30,155 --> 00:34:32,456
On Wednesdays,
let there be red roses.

649
00:35:04,755 --> 00:35:05,825
What the...

650
00:35:06,726 --> 00:35:08,896
You've got to be kidding me.

651
00:35:28,916 --> 00:35:30,246
Did you sleep well?

652
00:35:30,345 --> 00:35:32,786
Right. Yes.

653
00:35:38,186 --> 00:35:39,425
Where are you going?

654
00:35:40,885 --> 00:35:43,226
I'm late for work,
and I can't afford to be late.

655
00:35:43,755 --> 00:35:45,396
Sorry about this. I'll call you.

656
00:35:48,496 --> 00:35:50,166
But... Hold on.

657
00:35:54,706 --> 00:35:55,706
Of course.

658
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:58,706
It's kind of awkward
to face each other afterward.

659
00:36:09,316 --> 00:36:10,956
- Gosh.
- Unbelievable.

660
00:36:10,956 --> 00:36:12,786
Mom, come on.

661
00:36:13,155 --> 00:36:16,695
I really spent the night
at Sun Mi's place.

662
00:36:16,896 --> 00:36:20,095
What? You spent the night
at Sun Mi's place?

663
00:36:20,525 --> 00:36:22,465
Are you kidding me?

664
00:36:22,695 --> 00:36:24,536
From last night up until now,

665
00:36:24,536 --> 00:36:26,235
I called Sun Mi numerous times.

666
00:36:26,905 --> 00:36:29,675
But you say you slept
at Sun Mi's place. Unbelievable.

667
00:36:29,675 --> 00:36:33,175
I can't believe you're lying to me
of all people as well.

668
00:36:35,476 --> 00:36:38,385
Okay, fine. I'll tell you the truth.

669
00:36:41,586 --> 00:36:42,615
Mom.

670
00:36:44,516 --> 00:36:46,086
- Look.
- What?

671
00:36:46,425 --> 00:36:47,456
Check it out.

672
00:36:48,496 --> 00:36:50,396
What's this? My gosh.

673
00:36:51,155 --> 00:36:53,795
What the... This ring.

674
00:36:54,595 --> 00:36:57,166
Who gave you this?

675
00:36:58,666 --> 00:36:59,836
A guy.

676
00:37:01,036 --> 00:37:02,405
A guy?

677
00:37:03,476 --> 00:37:05,775
Were you...

678
00:37:06,476 --> 00:37:07,876
with a man last night?

679
00:37:09,275 --> 00:37:10,275
Yes.

680
00:37:11,586 --> 00:37:12,916
Mom, your wish...

681
00:37:13,615 --> 00:37:14,885
came true.

682
00:37:14,885 --> 00:37:15,885
My gosh.

683
00:37:16,615 --> 00:37:18,325
Myung Dong, my goodness.

684
00:37:19,186 --> 00:37:20,385
Myung Dong!

685
00:37:20,385 --> 00:37:22,956
My sweet girl Myung Dong.

686
00:37:23,095 --> 00:37:25,325
This calls for a celebration.

687
00:37:25,325 --> 00:37:28,396
This calls for a true celebration.

688
00:37:28,396 --> 00:37:29,766
My sweet daughter.

689
00:37:34,905 --> 00:37:36,005
Darn it.

690
00:37:36,905 --> 00:37:38,876
Ju Hee hurting you badly...

691
00:37:38,876 --> 00:37:40,345
isn't an excuse to sleep
with a random woman.

692
00:37:42,275 --> 00:37:44,845
You're out of your mind.

693
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,686
You crazy idiot.

694
00:37:55,155 --> 00:37:57,425
Leave me.

695
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:03,195
Excuse me.

696
00:38:03,195 --> 00:38:05,936
Were you the one
who tossed this sparkly object?

697
00:38:06,666 --> 00:38:08,235
There's no way I...

698
00:38:09,135 --> 00:38:10,135
Hold on.

699
00:38:13,876 --> 00:38:15,016
Okay.

700
00:38:17,115 --> 00:38:18,215
It's not here.

701
00:38:18,485 --> 00:38:19,746
The diamond ring isn't here.

702
00:38:21,786 --> 00:38:23,715
That cost a fortune.

703
00:38:30,795 --> 00:38:32,195
Unbelievable.

704
00:38:36,996 --> 00:38:37,996
Hold on.

705
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,130
That's not it.

706
00:38:41,878 --> 00:38:43,347
- Mom.
- Yes?

707
00:38:43,977 --> 00:38:46,517
Could this be a real diamond?

708
00:38:47,378 --> 00:38:49,247
Why else would it be this sparkly?

709
00:38:49,247 --> 00:38:52,287
Hey, give it here.

710
00:38:57,088 --> 00:39:00,198
This? It's a real diamond.

711
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:03,167
Are you sure it's real?

712
00:39:03,827 --> 00:39:06,937
A diamond of this size...

713
00:39:06,997 --> 00:39:09,207
must have cost
at least 50,000 dollars.

714
00:39:09,738 --> 00:39:12,707
He must be
from a super-wealthy family...

715
00:39:12,707 --> 00:39:14,638
to have bought a diamond this big.

716
00:39:14,638 --> 00:39:15,977
Did you say 50...

717
00:39:16,908 --> 00:39:20,878
Not 5 dollars, but 50,000 dollars?
Really?

718
00:39:22,178 --> 00:39:23,347
That's right.

719
00:39:25,088 --> 00:39:26,088
My gosh.

720
00:39:26,088 --> 00:39:27,088
- Mom.
- Yes?

721
00:39:27,088 --> 00:39:28,957
It's that guy.

722
00:39:28,957 --> 00:39:30,227
- What?
- What do I do?

723
00:39:30,727 --> 00:39:33,057
What else? Take it already.

724
00:39:33,057 --> 00:39:34,097
- Answer it.
- Right.

725
00:39:38,068 --> 00:39:39,867
Yes, it's me.

726
00:39:40,468 --> 00:39:41,798
Where are you right now?

727
00:39:43,068 --> 00:39:45,508
We need to meet right this second.

728
00:39:46,077 --> 00:39:47,108
Right now?

729
00:39:50,008 --> 00:39:51,347
Go and meet him.

730
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,818
Sure. I'll be right out.

731
00:39:55,077 --> 00:39:57,488
What did he say?
Does he want to see you?

732
00:39:57,818 --> 00:39:58,847
Yes.

733
00:39:59,517 --> 00:40:02,287
He wants to meet me
right this second.

734
00:40:03,528 --> 00:40:05,028
He must miss me already.

735
00:40:09,298 --> 00:40:11,568
We could've met up
after you got off from work.

736
00:40:13,497 --> 00:40:15,767
Don't tell me you already missed me.

737
00:40:17,807 --> 00:40:19,807
Well, it's...

738
00:40:28,948 --> 00:40:30,747
Anyway...

739
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:33,858
May I take your hand?

740
00:40:35,318 --> 00:40:36,358
My hand?

741
00:40:37,488 --> 00:40:38,557
Yes.

742
00:40:46,298 --> 00:40:47,298
Here.

743
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,508
What are you doing?

744
00:40:53,608 --> 00:40:54,807
Why are you taking the ring off?

745
00:40:55,278 --> 00:40:56,977
Give back the ring.

746
00:40:56,977 --> 00:40:59,448
Why? You gave it to me.

747
00:40:59,448 --> 00:41:02,617
No, this ring wasn't meant for you.

748
00:41:04,787 --> 00:41:05,847
I'm sorry.

749
00:41:06,457 --> 00:41:08,687
You see, it's too expensive.

750
00:41:10,358 --> 00:41:13,727
Didn't you give me the ring
to symbolize our new relationship?

751
00:41:13,727 --> 00:41:15,158
Of course not!

752
00:41:17,727 --> 00:41:18,727
Well...

753
00:41:21,497 --> 00:41:23,037
What happened last night...

754
00:41:23,037 --> 00:41:25,508
was a drunken mistake.

755
00:41:25,508 --> 00:41:26,878
We can't give it a serious meaning,

756
00:41:26,878 --> 00:41:28,138
not when we're both adults.

757
00:41:30,847 --> 00:41:34,278
Besides, it wasn't just me.
It was obviously...

758
00:41:34,878 --> 00:41:36,548
consensual.

759
00:41:38,218 --> 00:41:41,517
By the looks of it,
you are not on the younger side.

760
00:41:41,818 --> 00:41:43,827
I'm sure this isn't hard
to understand.

761
00:41:46,457 --> 00:41:48,128
Anyway, I apologize for this.

762
00:41:48,128 --> 00:41:50,798
I'll get going first, then.

763
00:41:55,897 --> 00:41:56,908
A mistake?

764
00:41:59,678 --> 00:42:01,238
Just a mistake?

765
00:42:07,048 --> 00:42:08,147
My head.

766
00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:09,847
My gosh.

767
00:42:13,218 --> 00:42:14,318
What did you say?

768
00:42:14,818 --> 00:42:15,988
A few months?

769
00:42:16,258 --> 00:42:18,287
Okay, fine.

770
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:20,528
I'll pay up, all right?

771
00:42:20,528 --> 00:42:23,267
I'll pay everything back
by the end of the month.

772
00:42:28,867 --> 00:42:31,437
Where on earth
am I going to get more money?

773
00:42:31,437 --> 00:42:33,408
It's not like I can
take out any more loans.

774
00:42:33,678 --> 00:42:36,778
Goodness me. My head's killing me.

775
00:42:37,747 --> 00:42:40,218
You want Ms. Park
to be paid in advance?

776
00:42:41,077 --> 00:42:44,548
That's right.
I know I'm asking for a lot,

777
00:42:44,548 --> 00:42:48,187
but the agency
is in urgent need of money.

778
00:42:48,718 --> 00:42:50,888
Could that be arranged, sir?

779
00:42:52,457 --> 00:42:54,258
Of course. I'll have that arranged.

780
00:42:55,227 --> 00:42:56,367
Really?

781
00:42:57,068 --> 00:42:59,367
Gosh, thank you so much.

782
00:42:59,767 --> 00:43:01,097
Ms. Park's the reason...

783
00:43:01,097 --> 00:43:03,707
"Straightforward Romance"
secured its funding.

784
00:43:03,867 --> 00:43:05,367
If it hadn't been for her,

785
00:43:05,638 --> 00:43:07,508
the main sponsor
Angel Investments...

786
00:43:07,508 --> 00:43:08,707
would have passed up
on this opportunity.

787
00:43:09,477 --> 00:43:10,678
For that, we're grateful.

788
00:43:12,747 --> 00:43:15,477
But please don't tell Do Ra...

789
00:43:15,477 --> 00:43:17,617
that she was paid in advance.

790
00:43:17,787 --> 00:43:20,057
I don't want to bother her
when she's filming.

791
00:43:20,218 --> 00:43:22,658
Of course. Don't worry about that.

792
00:43:26,358 --> 00:43:27,358
My gosh.

793
00:43:28,597 --> 00:43:30,068
I've been saved.

794
00:43:30,397 --> 00:43:32,897
I'll pay my debt
with Do Ra's earnings...

795
00:43:32,897 --> 00:43:35,138
and find a way out of this mess.

796
00:43:35,397 --> 00:43:36,537
Gosh.

797
00:43:40,307 --> 00:43:41,307
What?

798
00:43:44,647 --> 00:43:45,948
Who is it?

799
00:43:46,048 --> 00:43:48,218
CEO Gong Jin Dan
sent these by courier.

800
00:43:49,077 --> 00:43:50,988
CEO Gong Jin Dan?

801
00:43:51,847 --> 00:43:54,818
Goodness me.
What's with the flowers?

802
00:43:54,818 --> 00:43:56,727
I can't believe it.

803
00:44:00,597 --> 00:44:03,897
Wait. This is a Charmes purse.

804
00:44:04,528 --> 00:44:05,568
No way.

805
00:44:09,338 --> 00:44:11,707
This is a limited edition
Charmes purse.

806
00:44:12,468 --> 00:44:13,477
My gosh.

807
00:44:14,008 --> 00:44:17,477
He sent over a purse
that cost over 20,000 dollars.

808
00:44:19,977 --> 00:44:23,388
Who on earth
is this CEO Gong Jin Dan?

809
00:44:26,258 --> 00:44:29,488
I'm busy as is with my scenes
and the lines I have to memorize.

810
00:44:29,488 --> 00:44:31,287
Who on earth are we meeting today?

811
00:44:31,287 --> 00:44:33,198
The CEO of Angel Investments.

812
00:44:33,758 --> 00:44:35,557
We should meet him at least once
to extend our gratitude...

813
00:44:35,557 --> 00:44:37,597
since he's been
exceptionally good to you.

814
00:44:37,727 --> 00:44:40,798
What? Did you hound me
to get my makeup done...

815
00:44:40,798 --> 00:44:42,638
because we were going
to meet with him?

816
00:44:42,937 --> 00:44:45,838
Also, who are you to set this up
without asking me first?

817
00:44:45,838 --> 00:44:48,408
You would've postponed it
if I had asked.

818
00:44:48,408 --> 00:44:50,048
Besides, you need to eat, don't you?

819
00:44:50,048 --> 00:44:52,678
Mom, I have a lot of scenes
to film today.

820
00:44:53,048 --> 00:44:54,247
Fine.

821
00:44:54,247 --> 00:44:56,747
I get it, so say hello
and be on your way.

822
00:44:57,318 --> 00:45:00,258
Come on.
The CEO of Angel Investments...

823
00:45:00,258 --> 00:45:03,687
sent you the limited edition purse
from Charmes...

824
00:45:03,687 --> 00:45:06,057
and offered a blank check
to boost your ego.

825
00:45:06,057 --> 00:45:08,397
Shouldn't you at least
express your gratitude?

826
00:45:08,397 --> 00:45:10,367
He'll think you're rude...

827
00:45:10,367 --> 00:45:12,428
if you accept his generosity
without thanking him.

828
00:45:13,468 --> 00:45:16,367
Then, make it quick. Okay?

829
00:45:16,667 --> 00:45:19,367
I have a lot of emotional scenes
to film today.

830
00:45:19,367 --> 00:45:21,878
All right. I hear you.

831
00:45:22,338 --> 00:45:26,008
Just so you know,
CEO Gong Jin Dan...

832
00:45:26,008 --> 00:45:28,747
is the second son
of APP Group's late chairman.

833
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:32,017
So rather than looking uninterested,
greet him with a smile.

834
00:45:33,517 --> 00:45:37,628
You have nothing to lose
by getting on his good side.

835
00:45:37,628 --> 00:45:38,727
Okay?

836
00:45:38,727 --> 00:45:39,897
Fine.

837
00:45:41,457 --> 00:45:43,128
That darn brat.

838
00:45:49,707 --> 00:45:50,908
Hello.

839
00:45:51,608 --> 00:45:52,977
I'm Gong Jin Dan.

840
00:45:53,738 --> 00:45:56,077
Goodness. Hello.

841
00:45:57,178 --> 00:45:58,247
Hello.

842
00:45:59,948 --> 00:46:00,977
What?

843
00:46:01,747 --> 00:46:02,778
Hold on.

844
00:46:02,778 --> 00:46:03,917
That day outside the salon...

845
00:46:04,448 --> 00:46:05,548
Yes, that's right.

846
00:46:06,017 --> 00:46:07,057
You remember me.

847
00:46:08,388 --> 00:46:10,557
Gosh. You know each other?

848
00:46:11,388 --> 00:46:14,358
What kind of coincidence is this?

849
00:46:22,198 --> 00:46:25,068
Mr. Gong. Thank you so much.

850
00:46:26,037 --> 00:46:28,338
You thought so highly of my Do Ra...

851
00:46:28,678 --> 00:46:30,608
and guaranteed a higher pay.

852
00:46:31,048 --> 00:46:34,448
You even sent flowers
and a lovely gift to our home.

853
00:46:35,017 --> 00:46:38,017
A few words aren't enough
to show how grateful we are.

854
00:46:39,187 --> 00:46:41,088
Not at all. The honor's mine.

855
00:46:41,957 --> 00:46:44,187
I'd been a huge fan of Do Ra's.

856
00:46:45,727 --> 00:46:47,658
Oh, really?

857
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:49,597
Yes.

858
00:46:49,897 --> 00:46:51,968
I think I watched
all the dramas she was in...

859
00:46:51,968 --> 00:46:53,267
as a child actor.

860
00:46:53,767 --> 00:46:56,738
From "My ID is Gangbuk Beauty"
to "Windy Gang Poong."

861
00:46:57,568 --> 00:46:59,267
You watched "Windy Gang Poong" too?

862
00:46:59,267 --> 00:47:01,937
Yes. She spoke
the North Korean dialect so well.

863
00:47:02,178 --> 00:47:04,647
I copied what she said
and watched on time every week.

864
00:47:07,477 --> 00:47:09,718
"How did you make that long trip?"

865
00:47:10,448 --> 00:47:12,917
"I just did because I missed you."

866
00:47:13,488 --> 00:47:15,358
"If you keep annoying me,"

867
00:47:15,758 --> 00:47:19,628
"I'll rearrange your ribs
in a revolutionary way."

868
00:47:19,698 --> 00:47:20,698
My gosh.

869
00:47:21,397 --> 00:47:22,457
Goodness.

870
00:47:26,997 --> 00:47:30,167
- Oh, dear. Your clothes.
- What got into me?

871
00:47:30,307 --> 00:47:32,167
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

872
00:47:37,048 --> 00:47:39,307
Goodness. This Gong Jin Dan guy.

873
00:47:39,307 --> 00:47:41,417
Why does he keep glancing at Do Ra?

874
00:47:41,417 --> 00:47:42,548
He's so cute.

875
00:47:42,977 --> 00:47:45,488
I have a feeling
he's interested in her.

876
00:47:48,117 --> 00:47:51,327
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

877
00:47:52,287 --> 00:47:53,997
You messed up, Jin Dan.

878
00:47:55,428 --> 00:47:57,198
Why did you speak North Korean?

879
00:47:58,198 --> 00:47:59,838
You should've tried to look good.

880
00:48:00,068 --> 00:48:01,937
Instead, you talked like a fool.

881
00:48:02,497 --> 00:48:05,207
You even talked about rearranging
an annoying woman's ribs.

882
00:48:05,307 --> 00:48:06,908
That was just stupid.

883
00:48:08,638 --> 00:48:10,548
I couldn't even
cut a steak properly.

884
00:48:12,077 --> 00:48:15,077
I bet they noticed
it was because I was nervous.

885
00:48:16,488 --> 00:48:18,048
I feel humiliated.

886
00:48:23,827 --> 00:48:24,888
But still,

887
00:48:25,727 --> 00:48:28,758
Park Do Ra was so pretty.

888
00:48:31,128 --> 00:48:33,568
After that crazy fight,

889
00:48:33,838 --> 00:48:35,867
do you think Snark Do Ra
and Cha Bong Soo will come?

890
00:48:36,167 --> 00:48:37,638
I bet ten dollars that they don't.

891
00:48:37,767 --> 00:48:38,908
What about you?

892
00:48:39,437 --> 00:48:40,508
They'll come.

893
00:48:40,508 --> 00:48:42,937
They're professionals
who work for pay. They should.

894
00:48:44,678 --> 00:48:45,807
Here they are.

895
00:49:01,057 --> 00:49:03,628
Ms. Park. Thanks for coming.

896
00:49:04,997 --> 00:49:08,497
You and Director Hong
came to my house to plead with me.

897
00:49:09,198 --> 00:49:10,267
I had to come.

898
00:49:10,738 --> 00:49:12,138
Plus, I'm the lead.

899
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:15,338
You're a true professional.

900
00:49:19,048 --> 00:49:20,117
Curly-haired Assistant Director.

901
00:49:21,247 --> 00:49:22,948
Sorry, and thanks for yesterday.

902
00:49:24,287 --> 00:49:26,187
- What?
- You lost some hair...

903
00:49:26,318 --> 00:49:28,818
while defending me from Bi Bi.

904
00:49:30,687 --> 00:49:32,888
Why does she always
go for the hair first?

905
00:49:34,097 --> 00:49:36,997
You lost a lot, didn't you? Sorry.

906
00:49:37,497 --> 00:49:39,528
It's fine. I have pretty thick hair.

907
00:49:52,548 --> 00:49:54,577
What's the matter?

908
00:49:56,718 --> 00:49:57,787
Well,

909
00:49:58,747 --> 00:50:00,957
the comment about having thick hair.

910
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,827
I think I heard it before.

911
00:50:14,537 --> 00:50:16,167
I'm so darn tired.

912
00:50:27,477 --> 00:50:29,617
("Straightforward Romance")

913
00:50:51,568 --> 00:50:53,838
Bong Soo isn't completely dumb.

914
00:50:54,778 --> 00:50:56,608
He's chewing gum
to prepare to shoot a kiss.

915
00:50:57,807 --> 00:50:58,908
He has some manners.

916
00:51:01,017 --> 00:51:03,017
Let's shoot! Standby!

917
00:51:03,448 --> 00:51:04,488
Standby!

918
00:51:11,457 --> 00:51:12,488
Action!

919
00:52:01,477 --> 00:52:03,207
What was that? That's gross!

920
00:52:03,948 --> 00:52:05,577
You psycho!

921
00:52:06,378 --> 00:52:08,347
How dare you slap a man?

922
00:52:08,347 --> 00:52:10,017
- Get over here.
- Come on, now.

923
00:52:10,017 --> 00:52:11,287
- What?
- Come here.

924
00:52:11,588 --> 00:52:14,358
Director. That punk ate raw garlic.

925
00:52:14,557 --> 00:52:17,727
You disgusting scum.
How could you kiss me with garlic?

926
00:52:17,727 --> 00:52:20,497
Let go of me.
I want to end it with that witch.

927
00:52:20,497 --> 00:52:22,358
How do you think you'll do that?

928
00:52:27,667 --> 00:52:28,698
Oh, gosh.

929
00:52:37,408 --> 00:52:38,548
Ms. Park.

930
00:52:40,948 --> 00:52:42,948
You two caused us a lot of trouble.

931
00:52:44,718 --> 00:52:46,147
We couldn't shoot yesterday.

932
00:52:47,858 --> 00:52:49,957
And we canceled today's shoot too.

933
00:52:49,957 --> 00:52:51,227
That was...

934
00:52:51,588 --> 00:52:53,497
Dozens of people got here at dawn...

935
00:52:53,497 --> 00:52:55,128
to prepare and set everything up.

936
00:52:56,457 --> 00:52:57,628
Because of you two...

937
00:52:59,468 --> 00:53:01,698
I don't think that's right.

938
00:53:07,138 --> 00:53:08,408
I'm not saying this...

939
00:53:09,437 --> 00:53:11,878
because I side with Mr. Cha.

940
00:53:12,207 --> 00:53:14,218
I was at the scene then,

941
00:53:15,577 --> 00:53:17,048
but what you did...

942
00:53:18,218 --> 00:53:20,457
could easily have been
misunderstood.

943
00:53:22,388 --> 00:53:24,428
Regardless of everything else,
if it was a misunderstanding,

944
00:53:26,028 --> 00:53:28,698
I think we should smooth it over.

945
00:53:33,537 --> 00:53:34,638
Ms. Park.

946
00:53:36,638 --> 00:53:38,267
The lives and careers...

947
00:53:38,537 --> 00:53:40,577
of so many people
depend on this drama.

948
00:53:41,678 --> 00:53:44,678
For the many crew members
who work behind the scenes,

949
00:53:45,178 --> 00:53:47,647
and for the viewers
who look forward to watching,

950
00:53:48,818 --> 00:53:51,088
could you reconcile
with Mr. Cha today...

951
00:53:52,017 --> 00:53:53,988
and resume the shoot?

952
00:53:56,417 --> 00:53:57,588
Please.

953
00:54:09,497 --> 00:54:10,568
Okay.

954
00:54:12,738 --> 00:54:14,008
I thought about it,

955
00:54:14,678 --> 00:54:16,977
and I think I was wrong too.

956
00:54:18,247 --> 00:54:21,017
I'll apologize to Bong Soo.

957
00:54:22,548 --> 00:54:24,617
Will you really?

958
00:54:25,147 --> 00:54:28,158
But he keeps cursing me out.

959
00:54:28,818 --> 00:54:30,988
And trying to hit me.

960
00:54:32,358 --> 00:54:34,957
I'd like you to accompany me...

961
00:54:35,258 --> 00:54:36,968
when I go to apologize.

962
00:54:38,367 --> 00:54:40,068
I can do that.

963
00:54:40,997 --> 00:54:42,037
Thank you.

964
00:54:45,367 --> 00:54:46,408
It's so spicy.

965
00:54:54,417 --> 00:54:55,477
What?

966
00:54:56,417 --> 00:54:57,747
Are you back to slap me?

967
00:54:58,147 --> 00:55:00,417
No. Ms. Park came here,

968
00:55:01,088 --> 00:55:02,417
Mr. Cha,

969
00:55:03,117 --> 00:55:05,128
to apologize to you.

970
00:55:07,658 --> 00:55:08,727
What?

971
00:55:09,258 --> 00:55:10,267
Bong Soo.

972
00:55:11,367 --> 00:55:13,767
I'm sorry for slapping you.

973
00:55:15,338 --> 00:55:17,937
I reacted in a split second
before I realized it but...

974
00:55:20,278 --> 00:55:21,908
I sincerely apologize.

975
00:55:24,378 --> 00:55:27,647
And I acted out of line,
giving you the wrong idea.

976
00:55:28,948 --> 00:55:31,988
That day, I'd had too much to drink.

977
00:55:32,088 --> 00:55:35,117
I got so drunk,
I guess you looked hot.

978
00:55:35,988 --> 00:55:38,928
It's true that I confused you
by saying some silly things.

979
00:55:41,057 --> 00:55:43,097
But that was the extent of it.

980
00:55:43,097 --> 00:55:44,827
Nothing happened between us.

981
00:55:45,897 --> 00:55:48,638
I admit that Bi Bi and I
are not on great terms,

982
00:55:48,838 --> 00:55:50,568
but we are long-time colleagues.

983
00:55:51,238 --> 00:55:53,878
However much I liked you,
I shouldn't have done that.

984
00:55:55,238 --> 00:55:56,278
Anyway,

985
00:55:58,608 --> 00:56:01,077
sorry for doing something
that could've been misunderstood.

986
00:56:02,448 --> 00:56:03,718
It was my fault.

987
00:56:05,718 --> 00:56:07,057
I apologize.

988
00:56:12,628 --> 00:56:14,428
I apologize...

989
00:56:15,798 --> 00:56:16,798
for swearing at you.

990
00:56:18,468 --> 00:56:19,468
I knew it.

991
00:56:20,028 --> 00:56:22,767
I must say
you two are professional actors.

992
00:56:22,767 --> 00:56:25,167
You know
when to be cool and apologetic.

993
00:56:25,167 --> 00:56:27,077
And you know
when to accept apologies.

994
00:56:27,077 --> 00:56:29,178
No wonder why you're so successful.

995
00:56:31,608 --> 00:56:34,718
We will resume the shoot
after a one-hour break.

996
00:56:34,977 --> 00:56:36,247
Let's do this.

997
00:56:37,287 --> 00:56:38,517
Let's go.

998
00:56:46,858 --> 00:56:48,128
Thank you.

999
00:56:51,298 --> 00:56:52,367
Thank you.

1000
00:56:55,937 --> 00:56:57,638
You said
you had something to tell me.

1001
00:56:58,638 --> 00:57:00,638
What is it? Stop beating
around the bush and tell me.

1002
00:57:01,738 --> 00:57:04,077
I'm scared
when you want to talk to me.

1003
00:57:05,108 --> 00:57:06,247
Well...

1004
00:57:06,247 --> 00:57:09,647
You know Myung Soo,
my friend from high school, right?

1005
00:57:11,687 --> 00:57:12,847
What about him?

1006
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:17,488
Don't tell me you want
to start a business again.

1007
00:57:18,088 --> 00:57:20,557
The thing is,

1008
00:57:20,557 --> 00:57:22,557
used phones from Korea
are selling like hotcakes...

1009
00:57:22,557 --> 00:57:24,727
in Vietnam these days.

1010
00:57:24,727 --> 00:57:26,528
It's a roaring business.

1011
00:57:26,667 --> 00:57:29,568
So Myung Soo found
a new business channel.

1012
00:57:29,838 --> 00:57:33,108
He says
it's as easy as pie this time.

1013
00:57:33,108 --> 00:57:34,577
So I was thinking...

1014
00:57:35,878 --> 00:57:37,307
we should get a loan...

1015
00:57:38,207 --> 00:57:41,147
of 200,000 dollars
against this house.

1016
00:57:41,778 --> 00:57:44,247
What are you talking about?

1017
00:57:44,818 --> 00:57:45,888
Last time, you took out a loan...

1018
00:57:45,888 --> 00:57:48,158
of 300,000 dollars against
this house to start a business,

1019
00:57:48,158 --> 00:57:49,758
but it completely failed.

1020
00:57:49,758 --> 00:57:51,658
Pil Seung is still repaying...

1021
00:57:51,658 --> 00:57:54,258
the principal and interest on that.

1022
00:57:54,957 --> 00:57:57,667
Don't you even feel bad for him?

1023
00:57:57,997 --> 00:58:00,227
How could you think
about taking out a loan again?

1024
00:58:00,738 --> 00:58:04,367
That's why I want to do this
and clear the debt.

1025
00:58:04,508 --> 00:58:06,037
Just help me one more time.

1026
00:58:06,037 --> 00:58:08,207
I'm sure this one will go well.

1027
00:58:08,207 --> 00:58:10,878
Honey, please don't be like this.

1028
00:58:10,948 --> 00:58:13,508
I don't want anything from you.

1029
00:58:14,048 --> 00:58:16,117
I don't need you to do anything.

1030
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:18,048
Just lay low doing nothing.

1031
00:58:18,917 --> 00:58:20,017
Hey.

1032
00:58:21,258 --> 00:58:24,258
Sun Young, don't you think
you're being too harsh?

1033
00:58:25,287 --> 00:58:27,397
He wants to do something
as the head of the house.

1034
00:58:27,397 --> 00:58:29,698
And you're supposed
to give him your full support.

1035
00:58:29,698 --> 00:58:31,298
But what did you just say?

1036
00:58:32,167 --> 00:58:35,097
You want him to be stuck
in his room doing nothing?

1037
00:58:36,267 --> 00:58:37,707
It's not like
Hyun Chul is a living corpse.

1038
00:58:37,707 --> 00:58:39,238
Why would he be stuck in his room?

1039
00:58:41,108 --> 00:58:42,378
Mother.

1040
00:58:42,378 --> 00:58:44,908
This house is the only thing
we have left.

1041
00:58:44,908 --> 00:58:46,577
If we throw this away,

1042
00:58:46,577 --> 00:58:48,647
our whole family will end up
on the streets.

1043
00:58:48,647 --> 00:58:52,218
Hey! Stop being so haughty
just because you have this house.

1044
00:58:52,218 --> 00:58:55,988
Up until he got fired
from his job five years ago,

1045
00:58:56,258 --> 00:58:58,858
my son provided
for the whole family...

1046
00:58:58,858 --> 00:59:00,758
as the head of the house.

1047
00:59:01,028 --> 00:59:05,198
I get that your father bought
this house under your name,

1048
00:59:05,198 --> 00:59:07,767
but Hyun Chul has
a half-share in this house.

1049
00:59:08,338 --> 00:59:12,167
How could you use the house
to ride him over like that?

1050
00:59:12,707 --> 00:59:13,738
Mother.

1051
00:59:14,077 --> 00:59:17,178
When did I use the house
to ride him over?

1052
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:20,448
I just want to keep
at least this house safe.

1053
00:59:21,077 --> 00:59:23,178
While we're on the subject,

1054
00:59:23,448 --> 00:59:26,187
though your father passed away,

1055
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:29,287
I'm still really upset with him.

1056
00:59:29,287 --> 00:59:30,528
While he was alive,

1057
00:59:30,528 --> 00:59:33,088
his son-in-law supported him
his whole life.

1058
00:59:33,258 --> 00:59:34,528
But how could he...

1059
00:59:34,528 --> 00:59:37,568
transfer the title of the house
only to you before he passed away?

1060
00:59:38,727 --> 00:59:41,037
I mean,
he gave just away 30,000 dollars...

1061
00:59:41,037 --> 00:59:43,738
to that gold digger so easily.

1062
00:59:43,738 --> 00:59:46,937
Mom, why would you bring that up?

1063
00:59:48,077 --> 00:59:49,577
- Darn it.
- Hey.

1064
00:59:49,937 --> 00:59:51,307
Hyun Chul.

1065
00:59:52,008 --> 00:59:53,448
Hyun Chul.

1066
00:59:53,917 --> 00:59:56,417
Hyun Chul.

1067
01:00:00,048 --> 01:00:01,557
Wait, Hyun Chul!

1068
01:00:13,397 --> 01:00:15,097
My poor Hyun Chul.

1069
01:00:17,167 --> 01:00:19,167
Just because he isn't from
a rich family,

1070
01:00:20,037 --> 01:00:22,307
he's looked down on by his wife.

1071
01:00:39,658 --> 01:00:41,827
That's right. I at least have to...

1072
01:00:42,798 --> 01:00:44,698
get the money back.

1073
01:00:58,548 --> 01:01:00,048
Is this the right place?

1074
01:01:06,718 --> 01:01:08,858
This must be it.

1075
01:01:14,557 --> 01:01:16,097
Hey, Do Ra's mom.

1076
01:01:23,537 --> 01:01:24,937
Why do you look so surprised?

1077
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:28,108
Did you see a ghost or what?

1078
01:01:32,707 --> 01:01:34,678
I really don't want
to do the kissing scene.

1079
01:01:35,917 --> 01:01:37,747
What do we do?

1080
01:01:38,888 --> 01:01:40,218
Do you want me to do it for you?

1081
01:01:40,617 --> 01:01:42,057
- Will you?
- Okay.

1082
01:01:45,957 --> 01:01:47,428
This is for you.

1083
01:01:49,057 --> 01:01:50,158
Assistant Director Ko.

1084
01:01:52,128 --> 01:01:53,227
What's this?

1085
01:01:54,068 --> 01:01:56,468
How did you know
I wanted to have ice cream?

1086
01:01:57,968 --> 01:02:00,878
You apologize to Mr. Cha
for our drama's sake.

1087
01:02:00,878 --> 01:02:03,378
And you finished the tricky scene
in one go.

1088
01:02:04,077 --> 01:02:05,448
So I wanted to thank you.

1089
01:02:06,477 --> 01:02:08,778
I read an article
about how you eat ice cream...

1090
01:02:08,778 --> 01:02:10,448
when you're upset.

1091
01:02:11,017 --> 01:02:12,787
I hope it makes you feel better.

1092
01:02:13,318 --> 01:02:14,858
That's so sweet.

1093
01:02:16,158 --> 01:02:19,457
This is really touching.

1094
01:02:21,298 --> 01:02:22,497
This is no big deal.

1095
01:02:23,358 --> 01:02:25,028
I should get going then.

1096
01:02:28,497 --> 01:02:32,008
Wait,
Assistant Director Ko Pil Seung.

1097
01:02:33,408 --> 01:02:36,037
Thank you for everything.

1098
01:02:37,207 --> 01:02:39,577
It's nothing.

1099
01:02:40,077 --> 01:02:42,847
You keep helping me
in tough situations.

1100
01:02:43,448 --> 01:02:46,048
At the club,
when Bi Bi made a scene,

1101
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:48,417
and even when Bong Soo
was about to hit me.

1102
01:02:49,388 --> 01:02:50,557
I was just...

1103
01:02:51,388 --> 01:02:53,888
trying to protect
the female lead of our drama.

1104
01:02:53,888 --> 01:02:55,457
That's what I do.

1105
01:02:56,397 --> 01:02:59,798
I'll try my best for this drama
to repay your kindness.

1106
01:03:00,667 --> 01:03:02,068
So don't worry.

1107
01:03:02,937 --> 01:03:05,037
I won't give you a hard time.

1108
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:10,207
Thank you so much. I'll work hard.

1109
01:03:18,517 --> 01:03:19,847
It's fine.

1110
01:03:20,417 --> 01:03:22,057
I have more than enough hair
to spare.

1111
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:24,787
That's right.

1112
01:03:25,588 --> 01:03:28,698
That's what Dae Chung said
back then.

1113
01:03:34,798 --> 01:03:36,497
Would Dae Chung be doing well?

1114
01:03:38,008 --> 01:03:39,167
I wonder what he does.

1115
01:03:41,437 --> 01:03:43,778
Ms. Park, please get ready
for the next scene.

1116
01:03:46,878 --> 01:03:48,917
This is really strange.

1117
01:03:50,017 --> 01:03:51,488
Why does the Curly-haired
Assistant Director...

1118
01:03:51,488 --> 01:03:53,287
keep reminding me of Dae Chung?

1119
01:03:56,057 --> 01:03:57,258
Is this ready?

1120
01:03:59,028 --> 01:04:00,388
Is it because...

1121
01:04:00,858 --> 01:04:03,298
his hair looks like Dae Chung's?

1122
01:04:05,597 --> 01:04:06,597
Wait.

1123
01:04:07,267 --> 01:04:08,698
Ko Dae Chung.

1124
01:04:09,838 --> 01:04:10,867
Ko Pil Seung.

1125
01:04:12,638 --> 01:04:15,108
What? They have the same surnames.

1126
01:04:15,638 --> 01:04:17,548
Let's begin. Stand by.

1127
01:04:27,388 --> 01:04:29,258
Please go this way.

1128
01:04:30,617 --> 01:04:33,687
It's good to be out
in the fresh air.

1129
01:04:35,057 --> 01:04:36,628
Today is going to be...

1130
01:04:36,628 --> 01:04:38,968
That's because of the camera angle.

1131
01:04:45,207 --> 01:04:46,267
Assistant Director Ko.

1132
01:04:47,678 --> 01:04:49,037
Wait, Assistant Director Ko.

1133
01:04:49,037 --> 01:04:51,048
- I have something to ask you.
- My gosh.

1134
01:05:14,937 --> 01:05:17,707
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1135
01:05:50,037 --> 01:05:51,207
Be patient.

1136
01:05:51,338 --> 01:05:53,367
I'll get you some money
to start the business.

1137
01:05:53,508 --> 01:05:54,778
How would you do that?

1138
01:05:54,778 --> 01:05:58,477
Working with the grumpy actors
is just killing me.

1139
01:05:58,477 --> 01:06:00,247
What would I have done without you?

1140
01:06:00,247 --> 01:06:01,818
You will make a great director.

1141
01:06:01,818 --> 01:06:04,017
He gave me flowers...

1142
01:06:04,117 --> 01:06:06,588
and took my place in a scene
dressed as a woman...

1143
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:07,718
so that I wouldn't get hurt.

1144
01:06:07,787 --> 01:06:09,758
Does he have a crush on me?

1145
01:06:10,017 --> 01:06:11,457
