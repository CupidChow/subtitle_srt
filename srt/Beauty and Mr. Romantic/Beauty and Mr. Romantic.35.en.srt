00:00:00,104 --> 00:00:07,542
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:09,299 --> 00:00:10,298
Hey.

3
00:00:10,298 --> 00:00:11,399
(Episode 35)

4
00:00:11,399 --> 00:00:12,799
Remove them.

5
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:15,538
- What?
- Stop it.

6
00:00:15,538 --> 00:00:17,538
- Don't.
- Don't you dare.

7
00:00:17,538 --> 00:00:19,908
- What are you doing?
- Don't you dare.

8
00:00:20,308 --> 00:00:21,985
- Let go of me.
- Let go!

9
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:23,409
- Stop it.
- Let go of her!

10
00:00:23,409 --> 00:00:24,408
- Move.
- Get off me.

11
00:00:24,408 --> 00:00:26,878
- Don't you dare.
- Stop!

12
00:00:27,309 --> 00:00:28,518
Let go.

13
00:00:29,149 --> 00:00:30,678
Let go of her!

14
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:38,128
Don't do this.

15
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:44,099
- Ji Young?
- Ji Young!

16
00:00:47,728 --> 00:00:49,839
Get that reporter out of our faces!

17
00:00:50,139 --> 00:00:51,439
You can't take photos.

18
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:53,008
- You can't take photos.
- Sir, please head inside.

19
00:00:55,878 --> 00:00:57,408
- Darn it.
- Let go of us!

20
00:00:57,408 --> 00:00:59,949
- Step aside.
- Move!

21
00:01:04,548 --> 00:01:06,819
Ji Young, are you all right?

22
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:09,389
Yes, I'm fine.

23
00:01:09,658 --> 00:01:11,559
What about you? Are you okay?

24
00:01:13,029 --> 00:01:14,389
I'm good.

25
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,339
(Chairman Gong Jin Taek)

26
00:01:24,339 --> 00:01:25,744
What is it about?

27
00:01:25,768 --> 00:01:27,415
Sir, it's bad.

28
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,108
The protest is being covered
by most media outlets.

29
00:01:30,639 --> 00:01:32,048
What?

30
00:01:34,008 --> 00:01:36,279
(Staff of "The House of Roses"...)

31
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:38,706
(Protests for the Ban on Set
to be Lifted)

32
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:46,658
How can they shut down production...

33
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:49,128
without an explanation...

34
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:50,858
when the show is about to air?

35
00:01:51,128 --> 00:01:52,329
This is absurd.

36
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:54,598
(Lift the ban
on Director Ko Pil Seung!)

37
00:01:54,598 --> 00:01:56,139
I plead with you.

38
00:01:56,768 --> 00:01:58,339
Please lift the shutdown order
on set.

39
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:01,408
The actors wish to play our roles.

40
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:03,139
However,

41
00:02:03,339 --> 00:02:05,208
we will not film our scenes...

42
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:06,908
unless it is
with Director Ko Pil Seung.

43
00:02:07,548 --> 00:02:10,919
Until our requests have been met,

44
00:02:11,288 --> 00:02:12,889
we will keep protesting.

45
00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:18,858
An actor was hurt
during the protest,

46
00:02:18,858 --> 00:02:20,389
so that is being covered as well.

47
00:02:21,529 --> 00:02:22,905
An actor was hurt?

48
00:02:22,929 --> 00:02:24,129
Yes.

49
00:02:24,399 --> 00:02:25,729
Are the injuries serious?

50
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:28,699
She didn't have to be taken
to the ER,

51
00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:32,108
but the reporters are making a buzz
by covering this story.

52
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:35,778
Tell the people we hired
not to hurt any of the protesters.

53
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:37,278
Yes, sir.

54
00:02:39,078 --> 00:02:40,778
But sir...

55
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:42,749
What now?

56
00:02:43,418 --> 00:02:45,988
I figured you should know.

57
00:02:51,658 --> 00:02:52,958
What's this?

58
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:55,328
Is she among the protesters?

59
00:02:55,728 --> 00:02:57,858
Yes, that's why...

60
00:02:57,858 --> 00:03:01,229
rumors are flying about
your imminent divorce.

61
00:03:01,568 --> 00:03:02,969
On social media,

62
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:06,069
people are boycotting
APP Group's products.

63
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:08,039
What?

64
00:03:08,638 --> 00:03:11,809
CEO Gong separated Ms. Jang
from the protesters,

65
00:03:11,809 --> 00:03:13,349
and took her to the conference room.

66
00:03:14,008 --> 00:03:15,049
Darn!

67
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:17,279
(Chairman Gong Jin Taek)

68
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:28,258
How could you do this?

69
00:03:28,258 --> 00:03:30,428
How could you lock me up in here?

70
00:03:30,499 --> 00:03:33,099
What on earth
do you think you're doing?

71
00:03:33,168 --> 00:03:35,198
We haven't signed
the divorce papers yet,

72
00:03:35,198 --> 00:03:37,768
which means you're still
the lady of APP Group.

73
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:41,044
So how could you cause a scene
by protesting outside the building?

74
00:03:41,068 --> 00:03:44,379
The reporters caught sight of you
and are now posting articles.

75
00:03:44,908 --> 00:03:46,824
This all started because of you.

76
00:03:46,848 --> 00:03:48,625
Shouldn't you be repenting
for what you did wrong...

77
00:03:48,649 --> 00:03:49,679
rather than causing a scene?

78
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:51,518
That's what I wanted to do,

79
00:03:51,619 --> 00:03:53,924
but you made me take action.

80
00:03:53,948 --> 00:03:55,159
What?

81
00:03:55,888 --> 00:03:58,764
I said I would do
whatever you asked of me.

82
00:03:58,788 --> 00:03:59,788
But in return,

83
00:03:59,788 --> 00:04:01,604
I told you to leave Pil Seung
and GOGO Entertainment alone.

84
00:04:01,628 --> 00:04:03,098
What did he do wrong...

85
00:04:03,098 --> 00:04:04,558
that warrants harassment
of such a level?

86
00:04:07,228 --> 00:04:09,969
Honey, if this is
how it's going to be,

87
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:11,309
keep this in mind.

88
00:04:11,309 --> 00:04:13,068
I will fight this
until the very end,

89
00:04:13,068 --> 00:04:14,439
and I will not give you...

90
00:04:14,908 --> 00:04:16,939
an easy divorce.

91
00:04:17,908 --> 00:04:19,578
What?

92
00:04:25,249 --> 00:04:28,148
Honey, please calm down.

93
00:04:28,318 --> 00:04:31,289
You going over there will only
make it harder on Pil Seung.

94
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:33,259
How can we let this slide?

95
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:35,859
Pil Seung was wrongfully terminated,

96
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,599
and his crew is protesting in tears.

97
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:40,628
How can we not do anything
when we're his parents?

98
00:04:40,628 --> 00:04:42,499
It's do-or-die for all of us.

99
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:43,799
Honey, please.

100
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:45,039
- Let go of me.
- Wait, honey.

101
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:46,708
Hold on. Let me come with you.

102
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:50,715
Honey! Wait for me.

103
00:04:50,739 --> 00:04:52,448
(Chairman Gong Jin Taek)

104
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:00,689
Sir,

105
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:03,318
Director Ko's parents
are here to see you.

106
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:07,089
Tell them to leave.

107
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:13,068
It's not like I wanted to come here.

108
00:05:13,068 --> 00:05:15,739
You're the one
who made us come all this way.

109
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:17,539
You cannot barge in here
on short notice.

110
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:19,608
Step aside.
How dare you lay your hands on me?

111
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:22,308
Mr. Kim, leave us.

112
00:05:26,948 --> 00:05:28,579
Did we do something wrong?

113
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:31,418
Did Pil Seung do anything wrong?

114
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,549
We're the ones who were hurt more.

115
00:05:34,549 --> 00:05:36,388
Why must we suffer...

116
00:05:36,388 --> 00:05:38,529
when it was your wife
who wronged us?

117
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:42,198
All we did
was raise Pil Seung with love...

118
00:05:42,198 --> 00:05:45,068
after he was abandoned
as a newborn baby.

119
00:05:45,828 --> 00:05:48,298
Pil Seung didn't have
the slightest idea...

120
00:05:49,138 --> 00:05:52,468
and was shocked to find out that
your wife was his biological mother.

121
00:05:52,468 --> 00:05:54,778
He had a hard time taking that in.

122
00:05:54,778 --> 00:05:58,849
So why are you inflicting pain
on an innocent man?

123
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:02,419
If we had known
about their relationship,

124
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:04,719
we wouldn't have let him
take this job.

125
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:08,635
Pil Seung is only guilty of
working his butt off...

126
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:12,459
after signing
with GOGO Entertainment.

127
00:06:13,528 --> 00:06:16,459
This is inhumane.

128
00:06:16,758 --> 00:06:20,199
The power and money you have...

129
00:06:20,369 --> 00:06:22,299
shouldn't be used like this.

130
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:25,168
Is it supposed to be spent
stomping all over those beneath you?

131
00:06:25,268 --> 00:06:26,668
Honey, we should go.

132
00:06:48,328 --> 00:06:50,528
CEO Gong, back off!

133
00:06:50,528 --> 00:06:52,799
- Back off!
- Back off!

134
00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:54,968

- Do not!
- Do not!

00:06:57,539 --> 00:06:59,515
Return "The House of Roses!"

137
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:00,539
- Return it!
- Return it!

138
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:02,709
- Honey, look at poor Pil Seung.
- Return it!

139
00:07:03,138 --> 00:07:04,378
- Oh, goodness.
- Stop it!

140
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:07,448
Pil Seung's fighting hard out there.

141
00:07:07,448 --> 00:07:09,079
- You can't stand here crying.
- CEO Gong, back off!

142
00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:10,918
- He might see you.
- Back off!

143
00:07:11,718 --> 00:07:14,095
Do not change directors!

144
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:16,318

146
00:07:20,828 --> 00:07:23,529
- Return it!
- Mom. Father.

147
00:07:24,328 --> 00:07:25,628
What's going on?

148
00:07:25,799 --> 00:07:27,199
Why are you here?

149
00:07:28,028 --> 00:07:29,699
Isn't it obvious?

150
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:32,608
How could we not come
when it was in the news?

151
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:35,309
- Are things all right?
- Return "The House of Roses!"

152
00:07:35,309 --> 00:07:36,479
- Return it!
- Return it!

153
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,639
It's all right.

154
00:07:37,739 --> 00:07:39,378
I'll make sure
to wrap up the situation well,

155
00:07:39,378 --> 00:07:40,424
so don't worry too much.

156
00:07:40,448 --> 00:07:42,049
- Stop it!
- Stop it!

157
00:07:42,049 --> 00:07:45,048
- Okay. Don't overdo it.
- CEO Gong, back off!

158
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:48,635
You can't get hurt or ill,
okay, Pil Seung?

159
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:49,659
Stop it!

160
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:52,589
Pil Seung.
Stay strong and be sure to win.

161
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:54,358
- We're rooting for you.
- CEO Gong, back off!

162
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,898
- Get back to your spot.
- Back off!

163
00:07:56,898 --> 00:07:58,869
- Okay. Bye, Mom. Bye, Father.
- Do not change directors!

164
00:07:58,869 --> 00:08:00,075
- Okay, go.
- Do not!

165
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:01,529
- Take care.
- Bye.

- Return it!

168
00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:07,068
Come on.

169
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:09,708
Reopen the filming studio!

170
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,808
- Reopen it!
- Reopen it!

171
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,449
Dismiss Gong Jin Dan!

172
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:16,618
- Dismiss him!
- Dismiss him!

173
00:08:17,318 --> 00:08:19,618
Do not change directors!

174
00:08:19,818 --> 00:08:22,389
- What should we do, honey?
- Goodness.

175
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:24,589
Don't cry. Pil Seung will see.

176
00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:28,599
If we had known
about their relationship,

177
00:08:28,628 --> 00:08:30,798
we wouldn't have let him
take this job.

178
00:08:31,499 --> 00:08:33,199
This is inhumane.

179
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,639
The power and money you have...

180
00:08:37,198 --> 00:08:39,039
shouldn't be used like this.

181
00:08:39,109 --> 00:08:41,808
Is it supposed to be spent
stomping all over those beneath you?

182
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:55,294
Reopen the filming studio!

183
00:08:55,318 --> 00:08:57,558
- Reopen it!
- Reopen it!

184
00:08:57,889 --> 00:09:00,129
Return "The House of Roses!"

185
00:09:00,129 --> 00:09:02,058
- Return it!
- Return it!

186
00:09:02,598 --> 00:09:05,129
They reopened the filming set.

187
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:08,399
We can resume filming. We won.

188
00:09:09,838 --> 00:09:11,198
What about Director Ko's dismissal?

189
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:14,009
That was overturned too!

190
00:09:22,848 --> 00:09:23,979
Everyone!

191
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:26,149
Thank you.

192
00:09:26,488 --> 00:09:28,119
I owe it to you.

193
00:09:28,988 --> 00:09:30,718
With your support,

194
00:09:31,689 --> 00:09:33,188
I'll start over!

195
00:09:33,358 --> 00:09:35,235
I'll say "The House of Roses,"
you say "let's go!"

196
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:36,358
"The House of Roses!"

197
00:09:36,358 --> 00:09:37,559
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

198
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:38,568
"The House of Roses!"

199
00:09:38,568 --> 00:09:40,499
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

200
00:09:43,998 --> 00:09:46,438
- What a relief.
- This is great.

201
00:09:49,478 --> 00:09:50,708
Well done.

202
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:53,879
- We did it.
- Good job.

203
00:09:59,448 --> 00:10:00,688
I apologize.

204
00:10:01,189 --> 00:10:03,789
I let my personal issues
cause trouble within the company.

205
00:10:04,858 --> 00:10:08,229
To the director, scriptwriter,
cast, and crew,

206
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:13,129
I'd like to take the opportunity...

207
00:10:14,098 --> 00:10:15,668
to apologize once again.

208
00:10:22,939 --> 00:10:24,838
You've been through a lot too.

209
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:27,178
It can't have been easy...

210
00:10:27,248 --> 00:10:30,078
to protest alongside us
as CEO of the company.

211
00:10:30,578 --> 00:10:32,218
You gave us the strength
to carry on.

212
00:10:32,318 --> 00:10:33,489
Thank you.

213
00:10:33,988 --> 00:10:35,119
Not at all.

214
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:38,858
I failed to protect you
and let this happen,

215
00:10:38,858 --> 00:10:40,159
and I'm sorry.

216
00:10:41,088 --> 00:10:42,798
I'll do all I can...

217
00:10:43,198 --> 00:10:46,629
to make sure
the rest of the shoot goes well.

218
00:10:54,009 --> 00:10:56,208
We got through the crisis
thanks to you.

219
00:10:57,078 --> 00:10:58,909
To make it up to you,

220
00:10:59,179 --> 00:11:00,979
until the drama's wrapped up,

221
00:11:01,448 --> 00:11:02,879
I'll give it my all.

222
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:04,818
Thank you so much!

223
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,889
Good for you, Director Ko.

224
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:13,489
If you'd given up and left us,

225
00:11:13,828 --> 00:11:15,859
I'd have hated you forever.

226
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:19,444
Instead, throughout the pressure,
you stayed and didn't give up,

227
00:11:19,468 --> 00:11:20,828
and for that, I thank you.

228
00:11:21,468 --> 00:11:23,198
Well done, Director Ko!

229
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:27,238
I was anxious
you'd fly into a rage...

230
00:11:27,238 --> 00:11:28,779
and say you'd quit.

231
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:32,509
You have a great sense
of responsibility and patience.

232
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:33,808
Why would I quit?

233
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:37,119
I won't ever quit
until "The House of Roses" is done.

234
00:11:37,248 --> 00:11:40,289
I'll stick with you until the end!

235
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:44,259
Everyone.

236
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:46,958
This meal is on me.

237
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:50,259
Relax and eat all you want!

238
00:11:52,568 --> 00:11:55,468
Come on, guys. Grill them some meat.

239
00:11:55,468 --> 00:11:56,539
- Okay.
- Okay.

240
00:11:56,539 --> 00:11:57,568
- Eat lots.
- Thank you.

241
00:11:57,568 --> 00:11:58,869
- I'll bring some meat.
- Excuse me.

242
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:02,379
Thank you. Eat all you want.

243
00:12:02,539 --> 00:12:03,909
- I'll enjoy it.
- Sure.

244
00:12:03,909 --> 00:12:05,308
Thank you.

245
00:12:06,448 --> 00:12:08,519
Thanks for staying on our side.

246
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,619
I'll cook you some amazing meat.

247
00:12:10,818 --> 00:12:11,989
Thank you.

248
00:12:13,218 --> 00:12:15,389
- Can I have more of this?
- Sure.

249
00:12:18,789 --> 00:12:19,928
Thank you.

250
00:12:20,289 --> 00:12:21,389
Enjoy the food.

251
00:12:25,568 --> 00:12:27,399
It's even better
because you cooked it.

252
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:28,798
This is good.

253
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:32,369
Bring two more plates of pork belly.

254
00:12:32,468 --> 00:12:34,039
You should have some too.

255
00:12:34,968 --> 00:12:37,208
It tastes better with the sides.

256
00:12:42,478 --> 00:12:46,149
It's definitely worth trying
what a skilled eater recommends.

257
00:12:53,929 --> 00:12:55,928
Ji Young, eat all you want.

258
00:12:56,998 --> 00:12:58,629
You went through a lot today.

259
00:12:59,868 --> 00:13:02,869
I didn't, actually.

260
00:13:04,998 --> 00:13:06,668
Eat up. Thank you.

261
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:10,678
- Eat as much as you want.
- Thank you.

262
00:13:11,338 --> 00:13:12,479
Here.

263
00:13:14,478 --> 00:13:16,479
- It worked out well.
- I know.

264
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:19,649
We can eat as much as we want.

265
00:13:19,718 --> 00:13:21,548
It's so good.

266
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:26,129
Do you need anything else?

267
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:28,029
- Yes.
- Can I have more of this?

268
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:29,198
Sure you can.

269
00:13:29,629 --> 00:13:30,899
Where are you, Ji Young?

270
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:32,729
It's so delicious.

271
00:13:35,868 --> 00:13:37,269
I'm at a team dinner.

(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

273
00:13:42,838 --> 00:13:45,979
Bring two more plates of pork belly.

274
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,348
Leave right now. It's urgent.

275
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:50,279
Leave before I come barging in.

276
00:13:51,448 --> 00:13:52,889
Tell me if you need anything else.

277
00:13:54,218 --> 00:13:55,618
It's so nice.

278
00:13:55,618 --> 00:13:57,259
Let's get some more meat.

279
00:13:57,259 --> 00:13:58,334
It's delicious.

280
00:13:58,358 --> 00:14:01,129
Sorry, but something came up
at home.

281
00:14:01,129 --> 00:14:02,558
I need to leave.

282
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:04,129
Okay. Take care.

283
00:14:08,838 --> 00:14:10,598
Let's try this one.

284
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:13,139
Try it this way. It's so nice.

285
00:14:13,968 --> 00:14:16,838
(Goban Restaurant)

286
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:19,979
Ji Young.

287
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,149
Why are you leaving early?

288
00:14:23,318 --> 00:14:24,649
Well...

289
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:29,519
Something urgent came up at home.

290
00:14:29,789 --> 00:14:32,358
Is it your grandmother?
I'll drive you, then.

291
00:14:32,358 --> 00:14:34,659
No, you don't have to.

292
00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:38,204
I can't let you leave on your own
when you were hurt.

293
00:14:38,228 --> 00:14:40,668
- Let's go.
- No.

294
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:42,468
I'm fine.

295
00:14:43,338 --> 00:14:45,198
I called for a taxi.

296
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:48,808
This dinner is all about you.

297
00:14:48,838 --> 00:14:51,578
It's not right for you to leave.

298
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:54,285
The cast and crew all came here...

299
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:57,818
to congratulate you
and cheer for and support you.

300
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:01,348
Are you really okay?

301
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,718
Are you and your family all right?

302
00:15:05,689 --> 00:15:08,188
There aren't any problems,
are there?

303
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:15,639
No.

304
00:15:17,169 --> 00:15:18,639
I'm fine.

305
00:15:24,409 --> 00:15:25,548
Ji Young.

306
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:27,749
You're Do Ra,

307
00:15:28,748 --> 00:15:31,749
but you don't remember anything
so all I can do is watch from afar.

308
00:15:32,549 --> 00:15:33,848
It can be hard sometimes.

309
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:37,659
When will you stop pushing me away?

310
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:40,029
If your memory never returns,

311
00:15:40,488 --> 00:15:42,229
will you push me away forever?

312
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:46,168
How long will you make me wait?

313
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:54,438
Well...

314
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:57,879
Director...

315
00:16:02,118 --> 00:16:03,418
Talk to me.

316
00:16:04,118 --> 00:16:05,749
Something's going on, right?

317
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:17,598
Nothing's going on.

318
00:16:19,098 --> 00:16:21,098
I'm sorry to leave first.

319
00:16:22,598 --> 00:16:24,198
I have to go now.

(Goban Restaurant)

00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:47,759
Ji Young.

322
00:16:49,498 --> 00:16:51,659
I felt let down today.

323
00:16:53,498 --> 00:16:54,574
What?

324
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:57,338
I still can't believe
you demanded I step down.

325
00:16:58,299 --> 00:17:01,109
How could you even join
those losers for dinner?

326
00:17:01,909 --> 00:17:05,848
That was because
we were having a team dinner.

327
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:10,848
You seem to keep forgetting it,

328
00:17:11,348 --> 00:17:13,318
but you are my girlfriend now.

329
00:17:14,048 --> 00:17:16,789
But how could you be calling
for my resignation...

330
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:19,858
with those good-for-nothing fellows
when I was your boyfriend?

331
00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:23,358
You're not supposed to do
such a thing to your boyfriend.

332
00:17:28,528 --> 00:17:31,368
It's true that I'm dating you.

333
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,878
But Mr. Gong,

334
00:17:37,738 --> 00:17:39,548
this is about my work.

335
00:17:40,048 --> 00:17:41,308
When everyone is...

336
00:17:41,308 --> 00:17:43,849
working together
for our drama "The House of Roses,"

337
00:17:43,849 --> 00:17:45,689
I can't just sit back
and do nothing.

338
00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:48,789
I need you to respect my work.

339
00:17:50,058 --> 00:17:52,019
And I did believe...

340
00:17:52,689 --> 00:17:55,388
what happened here was unfair.

341
00:17:55,929 --> 00:17:57,128
What did you say?

342
00:17:58,558 --> 00:17:59,769
So what?

343
00:17:59,869 --> 00:18:02,638
Are you trying
to stand up for Ko Pil Seung?

344
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:06,408
How are you taking
your ex-boyfriend's side,

345
00:18:06,808 --> 00:18:08,509
not mine?

346
00:18:08,639 --> 00:18:11,038
No, it's not like that.

347
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:12,209
Forget it.

348
00:18:12,548 --> 00:18:16,048
Anyway, I don't want you
to take his side ever again.

349
00:18:16,048 --> 00:18:17,179
Okay?

350
00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:20,989
It's just bad manners to take
your ex-boyfriend's side against me.

351
00:18:21,389 --> 00:18:22,618
Do you understand?

352
00:18:23,689 --> 00:18:24,789
Yes.

353
00:18:25,988 --> 00:18:27,088
All right.

354
00:18:29,528 --> 00:18:30,858
Go ahead and eat.

355
00:18:31,099 --> 00:18:32,529
Do you not like the food?

356
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:33,699
Do you want something else?

357
00:18:33,968 --> 00:18:36,039
No.

358
00:18:36,869 --> 00:18:38,138
I like it.

359
00:18:43,008 --> 00:18:44,509
Try this too.

360
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,948
Get home safely.

361
00:18:45,948 --> 00:18:47,048
Bye.

362
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,148
You're on my side, Ji Young.

00:18:51,579 --> 00:18:53,089
- Sure.
- Okay?

364
00:18:53,089 --> 00:18:54,219
Yes.

365
00:19:02,629 --> 00:19:05,328
Bye. Goodnight.

366
00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:16,039
Ji Young.

367
00:19:20,849 --> 00:19:22,449
Why were you with Mr. Gong?

368
00:19:24,518 --> 00:19:26,249
You said you had a family emergency.

369
00:19:27,288 --> 00:19:29,358
Did you just say that
to meet Mr. Gong?

370
00:19:33,788 --> 00:19:34,888
Yes.

371
00:19:37,758 --> 00:19:39,029
That's true.

372
00:19:39,298 --> 00:19:41,128
But why did you meet him?

373
00:19:42,238 --> 00:19:45,098
Mr. Gong and I are
officially dating now.

374
00:19:46,738 --> 00:19:48,209
Mr. Gong is...

375
00:19:49,308 --> 00:19:50,878
my boyfriend now.

376
00:19:56,948 --> 00:19:59,148
What nonsense are you talking about?

377
00:20:00,518 --> 00:20:02,519
You hate him.

378
00:20:03,058 --> 00:20:05,289
I'm the one you like.

379
00:20:07,189 --> 00:20:08,958
I don't like you anymore.

380
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,959
I've decided to like Mr. Gong.

381
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,298
It's not that you like him now.

382
00:20:13,968 --> 00:20:15,298
You decided to like him?

383
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,169
No.

384
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:20,108
I do like him.

385
00:20:20,139 --> 00:20:22,479
It was a slip of the tongue.

386
00:20:24,478 --> 00:20:25,848
So, Director Ko,

387
00:20:29,048 --> 00:20:32,548
please stop showing up
at my place so late.

388
00:20:33,889 --> 00:20:35,489
You're making me uncomfortable.

389
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,489
I'll see you at work.

390
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,989
Please get home safely then.

391
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,208
Ms. Lee.

392
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,539
Director Ko.

393
00:20:57,778 --> 00:21:00,148
That silly thing
must be out of her mind.

394
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:04,818
I saw her cheat on you...

395
00:21:05,448 --> 00:21:09,289
with someone else the other day.

396
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,789
But you know, Director Ko,

397
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,558
that the person
whom Ji Young really likes...

398
00:21:15,758 --> 00:21:17,529
is you.

399
00:21:18,698 --> 00:21:20,298
Yes, I do.

400
00:21:21,028 --> 00:21:24,338
But Ms. Lee, do you know why
Ji Young is being like this?

401
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:27,239
That I don't know.

402
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,555
The whole thing happened...

403
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:32,279
without my being aware of it.

404
00:21:34,609 --> 00:21:38,179
Director Ko, please wait a bit.

405
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:42,618
I'll figure out
what's going on with her.

406
00:21:42,819 --> 00:21:44,119
So, Director Ko,

407
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:48,088
please don't have
a change of heart until then.

408
00:21:48,528 --> 00:21:51,459
Okay, I will never change.

409
00:21:54,528 --> 00:21:57,239
We are allies now.

410
00:21:58,339 --> 00:21:59,469
Sure.

411
00:22:04,738 --> 00:22:07,009
Gosh, that darn leech.

412
00:22:07,308 --> 00:22:10,179
Why wouldn't he
give up on my Ji Young?

413
00:22:10,748 --> 00:22:12,919
What do I do now?

414
00:22:14,018 --> 00:22:15,919
And that old hag.

415
00:22:34,654 --> 00:22:36,584
What if I like you again...

416
00:22:37,614 --> 00:22:39,254
and recover my memories?

417
00:22:40,823 --> 00:22:44,093
What if I end up blaming you,

418
00:22:45,493 --> 00:22:47,163
hating you,

419
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:50,663
and having a hard time again?

420
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:57,274
I'm sure
she still has feelings for me.

421
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:00,603
But why?

422
00:23:02,944 --> 00:23:04,813
I don't like you anymore.

423
00:23:04,813 --> 00:23:06,743
I've decided to like Mr. Gong.

424
00:23:06,743 --> 00:23:08,113
It's not that you like him now.

425
00:23:08,753 --> 00:23:10,054
You decided to like him?

426
00:23:10,614 --> 00:23:12,153
No.

427
00:23:13,224 --> 00:23:14,894
I do like him.

428
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,324
It was a slip of the tongue.

429
00:23:20,424 --> 00:23:21,863
There must be something wrong.

430
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:24,433
Something's wrong.

431
00:23:41,783 --> 00:23:42,984
Director Ko?

432
00:23:44,853 --> 00:23:46,453
We need to talk.

433
00:23:51,364 --> 00:23:52,494
Director Ko.

434
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:55,834
You were here yesterday too.
Why do you keep coming here?

435
00:23:56,293 --> 00:23:57,664
Why do you keep swaying Ji Young?

436
00:23:57,664 --> 00:23:59,404
You two were over a long time ago.

437
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:01,534
Why are you being like this?

438
00:24:03,303 --> 00:24:04,873
Ji Young is dating Mr. Gong.

439
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:07,343
That's your doing, right?

440
00:24:08,474 --> 00:24:10,343
You sent her
to the nightclub before.

441
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:14,143
Why are you making her date him now?

442
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:17,284
Did you get money from him?

443
00:24:17,783 --> 00:24:18,923
Money?

444
00:24:19,654 --> 00:24:21,353
What money are you talking about?

445
00:24:21,724 --> 00:24:24,353
What kind of nonsense is that?

446
00:24:24,593 --> 00:24:26,023
I can't believe this.

447
00:24:26,023 --> 00:24:28,393
It's not like you can say anything
that comes to your mind.

448
00:24:29,533 --> 00:24:32,103
This is how things are
supposed to be.

449
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:35,573
Ji Young and Mr. Gong had
feelings for each other.

450
00:24:35,573 --> 00:24:38,244
They were going to get engaged.

451
00:24:39,843 --> 00:24:40,943
But...

452
00:24:41,474 --> 00:24:42,814
Director Ko,

453
00:24:43,214 --> 00:24:46,343
what gives you the right
to take issue with me on that?

454
00:24:46,644 --> 00:24:47,883
Seriously,

455
00:24:48,184 --> 00:24:50,184
this is just absurd.

456
00:24:50,184 --> 00:24:52,554
When Ji Young was Do Ra,
you gave her a hard time...

457
00:24:53,224 --> 00:24:54,853
because of money.

458
00:24:55,924 --> 00:24:57,893
Ji Young wouldn't be like this
if it wasn't about money.

459
00:24:58,823 --> 00:25:00,623
Whatever the reason is,

460
00:25:00,724 --> 00:25:04,033
you have no right
to take issue with me.

461
00:25:04,033 --> 00:25:05,804
There's nothing going on
between you and Ji Young.

462
00:25:08,503 --> 00:25:11,203
Is this a situation where a director
has a thing for a colleague actress?

463
00:25:11,704 --> 00:25:14,380
That's against work ethics.

464
00:25:14,404 --> 00:25:17,273
Director Ko,
please leave my Ji Young alone.

465
00:25:17,273 --> 00:25:19,813
Otherwise,
I will make an issue of it.

466
00:25:19,813 --> 00:25:22,214
I'll tell people that
you're using your authority...

467
00:25:22,214 --> 00:25:23,853
to boss an actress around.

468
00:25:26,184 --> 00:25:29,593
And I have something to give you.

469
00:25:30,924 --> 00:25:32,123
Director Ko.

470
00:25:33,624 --> 00:25:37,234
This is the 50,000 dollars
that you paid to the nightclub.

471
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:40,803
You seem to believe that
you have a say in our matters...

472
00:25:40,803 --> 00:25:42,033
because of the 50,000 dollars
you spent,

473
00:25:42,033 --> 00:25:43,373
so I'm giving you...

474
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,943
an extra 500 dollars as interest.

475
00:25:46,573 --> 00:25:49,013
So we're even now.

476
00:25:49,013 --> 00:25:50,843
Stay away from Ji Young.

477
00:25:51,343 --> 00:25:53,314
Remember that I paid you back.

478
00:25:56,984 --> 00:25:59,183
I was going to leave,

479
00:25:59,484 --> 00:26:01,154
but I'm just too furious.

480
00:26:01,154 --> 00:26:02,393
Listen, Ko Pil Seung.

481
00:26:02,593 --> 00:26:03,923
Where's your conscience?

482
00:26:04,394 --> 00:26:06,294
If it hadn't been for you,

483
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:10,534
Do Ra would've married Mr. Gong
and had a luxurious life.

484
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,934
She wouldn't have died
if you had left her alone.

485
00:26:13,934 --> 00:26:17,380
Just look at the state
she showed up in.

486
00:26:17,404 --> 00:26:19,703
This is all your fault.

487
00:26:21,644 --> 00:26:22,774
Ko Pil Seung.

488
00:26:23,343 --> 00:26:25,744
If you feel
the slightest bit responsible...

489
00:26:26,243 --> 00:26:28,584
and if you truly want
what's best for her,

490
00:26:29,783 --> 00:26:33,024
you will stay away from her. Got it?

491
00:26:34,154 --> 00:26:35,324
Unbelievable.

492
00:26:35,993 --> 00:26:37,754
I'm asking you to do that.

493
00:26:37,894 --> 00:26:39,593
My gosh.

494
00:26:40,394 --> 00:26:41,494
Goodness.

495
00:26:51,103 --> 00:26:52,943
Where did Ms. Baek
get all this money?

496
00:26:55,874 --> 00:26:57,574
Once again, was it for the money?

497
00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:03,113
No way.

498
00:27:04,353 --> 00:27:05,584
If she has a heart...

499
00:27:10,753 --> 00:27:11,863
Ji Young.

500
00:27:12,394 --> 00:27:15,309
You used to love this mango cake.

501
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:16,433
Try it.

502
00:27:18,263 --> 00:27:19,504
Mango cake?

503
00:27:20,033 --> 00:27:22,133
Was this my favorite?

504
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:24,749
I haven't had this before.

505
00:27:24,773 --> 00:27:26,974
Really? Try some, then.

506
00:27:35,714 --> 00:27:37,584
That's delicious.

507
00:27:37,984 --> 00:27:40,084
It melts in your mouth.

508
00:27:40,424 --> 00:27:41,893
How is it this good?

509
00:27:42,593 --> 00:27:44,353
I knew you'd like it.

510
00:27:44,864 --> 00:27:46,363
Thanks, Do Jun.

511
00:27:46,523 --> 00:27:47,824
It's really delicious.

512
00:27:56,974 --> 00:27:58,074
Ji Young.

513
00:27:58,204 --> 00:27:59,943
- Yes?
- Here's some money to spend.

514
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,673
- Money to spend?
- Back in the day,

515
00:28:03,714 --> 00:28:05,814
you always gave me money to spend.

516
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:07,460
This isn't much though.

517
00:28:07,484 --> 00:28:09,989
Why would you give me
money to spend?

518
00:28:10,013 --> 00:28:11,984
That's a job for your big sister.

519
00:28:13,083 --> 00:28:15,254
Do Jun, just wait a while longer.

520
00:28:15,624 --> 00:28:18,464
I'll earn more money
and give you enough to spend.

521
00:28:18,464 --> 00:28:19,663
Don't, Ji Young.

522
00:28:21,424 --> 00:28:23,464
I won't take your money anymore.

523
00:28:24,464 --> 00:28:25,804
I'm all grown up now.

524
00:28:27,204 --> 00:28:28,304
From this moment on,

525
00:28:28,904 --> 00:28:31,203
I'll give back
everything you did for me.

526
00:28:33,343 --> 00:28:35,173
So please take it.

527
00:28:36,073 --> 00:28:38,514
I really wanted
to give you this money.

528
00:28:39,783 --> 00:28:40,943
Gosh.

529
00:28:44,884 --> 00:28:46,254
Sure, Do Jun.

530
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:50,093
I'll take it.

531
00:28:52,823 --> 00:28:54,123
You...

532
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:58,304
You may feel awkward around me
since you've lost your memories,

533
00:29:00,303 --> 00:29:01,933
but you're still my sister.

534
00:29:03,474 --> 00:29:05,173
So be comfortable around me.

535
00:29:09,474 --> 00:29:11,113
You're adorable.

536
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:15,753
That's right.
You always said I was adorable...

537
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:17,559
and called me your boy.

538
00:29:17,583 --> 00:29:20,453
- I called you my boy?
- Yes.

539
00:29:20,523 --> 00:29:24,093
I don't think
I can call you that just yet.

540
00:29:26,993 --> 00:29:28,093
Enjoy.

541
00:29:29,293 --> 00:29:30,769
- This is delicious.
- Really?

542
00:29:30,793 --> 00:29:32,833
Ji Young, Do Jun, what's this?

543
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:34,933
Are you having cake without us?

544
00:29:36,003 --> 00:29:37,833
Mom, tell them off.

545
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:40,343
They always hang out without me.

546
00:29:40,343 --> 00:29:41,474
Is that so?

547
00:29:41,914 --> 00:29:43,413
Ji Young and Do Jun.

548
00:29:43,644 --> 00:29:46,883
How dare you exclude
my son Geum Dong?

549
00:29:47,013 --> 00:29:49,154
Grandma, come and have a seat.

550
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:51,329
Sure thing.

551
00:29:51,353 --> 00:29:53,284
Mom, are you kidding me?

552
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,053
Grandma, what do you want?
What can I order for you?

553
00:29:56,053 --> 00:29:57,893
- Do Sik, come on.
- This is more than enough.

554
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,564
Ms. Jang,

555
00:30:01,394 --> 00:30:03,593
here are the divorce papers
sent over by the chairman.

556
00:30:05,033 --> 00:30:06,363
Sure thing, Attorney Kang.

557
00:30:07,404 --> 00:30:09,173
I'll read them and get back to you.

558
00:30:11,033 --> 00:30:12,343
I'll sign them then.

559
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:14,544
Sure, read them and get back to me.

560
00:30:14,803 --> 00:30:17,443
I'll get going, then.

561
00:30:33,293 --> 00:30:34,894
(Divorce Agreement)

562
00:30:34,894 --> 00:30:36,964
(Gong Jin Taek, Jang Soo Yeon)

563
00:30:47,043 --> 00:30:48,890
Mr. Gong, what is this about?

564
00:30:48,914 --> 00:30:50,213
Ms. Jang,

565
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:54,644
you have been dismissed as CEO
of GOGO Entertainment as of today.

566
00:30:58,154 --> 00:30:59,424
What?

567
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:01,154
Jin Dan,

568
00:31:01,553 --> 00:31:03,924
what do you mean
I've been dismissed?

569
00:31:04,353 --> 00:31:07,963
The board just agreed
on your dismissal.

570
00:31:09,364 --> 00:31:11,434
That's why I will be taking over...

571
00:31:11,664 --> 00:31:14,380
as interim CEO
of GOGO Entertainment.

572
00:31:14,404 --> 00:31:17,303
So please vacate this office.

573
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:20,644
Who says I'm dismissed?

574
00:31:21,543 --> 00:31:24,213
Don't just stand there
and move her things out.

575
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:26,884
What do you think you're doing?

576
00:31:27,543 --> 00:31:28,813
Stop this immediately.

577
00:31:28,813 --> 00:31:32,453
Soo Yeon, it's Jin Taek
you should take it up with.

578
00:31:33,454 --> 00:31:35,430
The order came...

579
00:31:35,454 --> 00:31:36,654
from APP Group's Chairman Gong,

580
00:31:36,654 --> 00:31:38,864
the largest shareholder
of GOGO Entertainment.

581
00:31:40,763 --> 00:31:42,894
Until I get back here,

582
00:31:43,093 --> 00:31:46,003
leave everything as is.
Do you hear me?

583
00:31:53,343 --> 00:31:54,574
All right.

584
00:31:55,743 --> 00:31:58,243
Ms. Jang has been removed
from her position.

585
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,614
And I, Gong Jin Dan,

586
00:32:01,184 --> 00:32:03,384
will be acting as interim CEO.

587
00:32:04,513 --> 00:32:07,553
I hope to do my best
for GOGO Entertainment,

588
00:32:07,924 --> 00:32:11,394
so I ask for all your cooperation.

589
00:32:16,664 --> 00:32:21,404
(Chairman Gong Jin Taek)

590
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:26,243
Honey, how could you?

591
00:32:28,644 --> 00:32:30,114
Mr. Kim, leave us.

592
00:32:36,813 --> 00:32:39,483
Anything you need to say
will be said to Attorney Kang.

593
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:42,253
There's nothing for us
to talk about in person.

594
00:32:43,224 --> 00:32:45,053
I don't want to see you again,

595
00:32:45,993 --> 00:32:47,263
so leave.

596
00:32:47,464 --> 00:32:48,834
Jin Taek, please.

597
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,864
How can you dismiss me
as CEO of GOGO Entertainment?

598
00:32:52,134 --> 00:32:54,333
I told you
I didn't want anything else...

599
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:55,974
other than GOGO Entertainment.

600
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,334
How could you do this to me?

601
00:33:00,303 --> 00:33:02,543
Why? Is it because of Ko Pil Seung?

602
00:33:03,374 --> 00:33:05,344
So that you could keep your son
by your side?

603
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,213
You want to see him every day,
is that it?

604
00:33:09,513 --> 00:33:12,424
- Honey, please!
- I'm sorry, but no.

605
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:14,354
I can't allow that.

606
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:17,823
I allowed "The House of Roses"
to continue filming...

607
00:33:17,823 --> 00:33:19,064
due to various reasons,

608
00:33:19,563 --> 00:33:20,593
but I'm closing
GOGO Entertainment down...

609
00:33:20,593 --> 00:33:21,924
once they finish.

610
00:33:22,234 --> 00:33:24,763
Jin Dan will serve
as interim CEO until then,

611
00:33:24,763 --> 00:33:26,134
so leave knowing that.

612
00:33:26,234 --> 00:33:27,503
And get ready...

613
00:33:28,634 --> 00:33:30,203
to sign the divorce papers
as promised.

614
00:33:33,204 --> 00:33:35,374
As if I'll back out this easily.

615
00:33:36,374 --> 00:33:38,144
If this is how it's going to be,

616
00:33:38,543 --> 00:33:41,543
I won't accept your terms!

617
00:33:41,884 --> 00:33:43,114
What?

618
00:33:43,184 --> 00:33:44,930
Have you lost all your conscience?

619
00:33:44,954 --> 00:33:46,553
As if I'd let you get what you want!

620
00:33:47,853 --> 00:33:51,454
Don't argue!

621
00:33:51,454 --> 00:33:52,700
Ma Ri!

622
00:33:52,724 --> 00:33:54,924
- Ma Ri, are you all right?
- Don't argue!

623
00:33:54,924 --> 00:33:56,664
- Don't argue!
- Ma Ri.

624
00:33:56,664 --> 00:33:58,234
- Ma Ri...
- Ma Ri.

625
00:33:58,234 --> 00:33:59,904
- Calm down.
- Ma Ri.

626
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:02,533
- Ma Ri, please.
- Ma Ri.

627
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:07,074
Gong Ma Ri,

628
00:34:07,543 --> 00:34:09,013
what's with that suitcase?

629
00:34:10,043 --> 00:34:11,874
I'm not going to live here anymore.

630
00:34:12,114 --> 00:34:13,814
I'm not going to live with you.

631
00:34:14,184 --> 00:34:16,614
Ma Ri, what are you talking about?

632
00:34:17,253 --> 00:34:18,623
I may not be right in the head,

633
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:19,824
but I can tell
what's wrong from right.

634
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:22,023
What Mom did was wrong,

635
00:34:22,023 --> 00:34:23,194
but your actions are even worse.

636
00:34:23,194 --> 00:34:25,464
That's why I can't live
with you right now.

637
00:34:25,893 --> 00:34:27,464
I'm 28 now,

638
00:34:27,464 --> 00:34:29,564
and I can choose
what to do with my life.

639
00:34:29,764 --> 00:34:31,664
And I'm going to live with Mom.

640
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,303
What on earth are you saying?

641
00:34:35,174 --> 00:34:37,873
Ma Ri, are you saying
you won't live with your dad...

642
00:34:37,873 --> 00:34:40,050
but with that evil witch?

643
00:34:40,074 --> 00:34:42,413
- Don't talk that way about my mom!
- Ma Ri.

644
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:43,949
Ma Ri, what's wrong with you?

645
00:34:43,973 --> 00:34:45,960
How can you move out
of your dad's house?

646
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:48,084
- Ms. Yeoju, grab her.
- Sure.

647
00:34:48,654 --> 00:34:51,253
- No, let go of me.
- Come on.

648
00:34:51,253 --> 00:34:52,999
- Take her to her room.
- Come here.

649
00:34:53,023 --> 00:34:55,054
Dad, I hate you.

650
00:34:55,054 --> 00:34:57,194
Why won't you let me go to Mom?

651
00:34:57,194 --> 00:34:59,023
I want to live with Mom!

652
00:34:59,023 --> 00:35:01,599
- Ma Ri, stop.
- Let go of me!

653
00:35:01,623 --> 00:35:04,234
- Stop it. I hate you, Dad.
- Unbelievable.

654
00:35:05,163 --> 00:35:07,604
Look at what our family has become.

655
00:35:10,103 --> 00:35:12,444
All this because
you married the wrong woman!

656
00:35:22,183 --> 00:35:24,714
What will you do with Ma Ri
after the divorce?

657
00:35:27,054 --> 00:35:28,823
What do you mean by that?

658
00:35:29,353 --> 00:35:31,894
It hurts to say this,

659
00:35:33,094 --> 00:35:35,564
but Ma Ri isn't like other children.

660
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:39,033
She only has the intelligence
of a 12-year-old.

661
00:35:40,203 --> 00:35:42,403
It's wrong to keep her
locked up like that...

662
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:45,033
when all she wants
is to be with her mom.

663
00:35:46,404 --> 00:35:49,473
I know that she
is the apple of your eye,

664
00:35:50,444 --> 00:35:54,243
but Ma Ri should live
with her mother.

665
00:35:54,744 --> 00:35:56,484
It's for her sake as well.

666
00:35:57,484 --> 00:35:58,714
Auntie, please.

667
00:35:58,784 --> 00:36:01,624
Ever since she was young,
her mother took care of her.

668
00:36:02,023 --> 00:36:03,194
After Ma Ri suffered her injury,

669
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:06,564
her mom took her to see doctors
in the US.

670
00:36:07,594 --> 00:36:09,964
Are you going
to keep her locked up like that?

671
00:36:11,134 --> 00:36:14,334
Let Ma Ri go to her mom.

672
00:36:20,744 --> 00:36:22,044
And Jin Taek,

673
00:36:23,273 --> 00:36:24,874
seriously consider...

674
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,243
what I'm about to tell you.

675
00:36:30,614 --> 00:36:33,024
Once Ma Ri goes
to live with her mom,

676
00:36:33,154 --> 00:36:34,883
no one will be left by your side.

677
00:36:36,453 --> 00:36:40,294
Also, it'll be difficult for you
to remarry and start over.

678
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:42,633
Even if it's possible,

679
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,664
when will you marry someone new...

680
00:36:45,264 --> 00:36:47,403
and raise another child?

681
00:36:50,203 --> 00:36:51,734
That's why I propose...

682
00:36:52,904 --> 00:36:55,444
that you adopt Jin Dan on paper.

683
00:36:56,643 --> 00:36:58,013
Adopt him?

684
00:36:58,714 --> 00:37:01,444
Why would you say that
out of the blue?

685
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:05,383
Just consider it.
It's not entirely crazy.

686
00:37:05,953 --> 00:37:09,254
Adopt Jin Dan as my son?

687
00:37:09,723 --> 00:37:11,894
Auntie, please.

688
00:37:11,924 --> 00:37:13,893
Jin Dan has everything
going for him...

689
00:37:13,893 --> 00:37:16,593
except for the fact
that he's the son of a mistress.

690
00:37:17,094 --> 00:37:19,803
Still, he is of the Gong bloodline.

691
00:37:20,163 --> 00:37:22,979
If you take this opportunity...

692
00:37:23,003 --> 00:37:24,479
to adopt him,

693
00:37:24,503 --> 00:37:26,744
Tae Hee's family...

694
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,813
will also think more highly of him.

695
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:31,119
Our family will stand even taller
because of it.

696
00:37:31,143 --> 00:37:32,820
Auntie, still.

697
00:37:32,844 --> 00:37:36,460
How can I adopt my half-brother?

698
00:37:36,484 --> 00:37:38,883
That may have been custom
back in the day,

699
00:37:38,953 --> 00:37:40,683
but the world
is a different place now.

700
00:37:40,683 --> 00:37:42,670
Consider your age.

701
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:45,823
Don't brush this off
and just think about it.

702
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:53,564
What?

703
00:37:53,833 --> 00:37:56,834
You want Jin Taek to adopt me?

704
00:37:57,304 --> 00:37:58,504
That's right.

705
00:37:58,973 --> 00:38:01,073
You're the only one we have
in our family now.

706
00:38:01,703 --> 00:38:03,143
Your brother's too old...

707
00:38:03,143 --> 00:38:05,173
to marry someone new
and raise a successor.

708
00:38:05,884 --> 00:38:08,383
It's wiser to just adopt you
as his son.

709
00:38:09,984 --> 00:38:13,059
But still, that sounds absurd.

710
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:15,153
Jin Dan's my son.

711
00:38:15,223 --> 00:38:18,754
I don't know
how Chairman Gong will take this,

712
00:38:18,924 --> 00:38:21,694
but he will accept it
for the sake of this family.

713
00:38:22,563 --> 00:38:24,994
So if he agrees to it,

714
00:38:24,994 --> 00:38:27,803
do so for the sake of this family.

715
00:38:28,833 --> 00:38:32,374
Jin Dan, it wouldn't be bad for you
to be Jin Taek's adopted son.

716
00:38:32,674 --> 00:38:34,543
What will happen to this family
if this doesn't happen?

717
00:38:34,543 --> 00:38:36,743
Once Ma Ri goes
to live with her mom,

718
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:39,113
Chairman Gong
will have no successor.

719
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,984
Jin Dan, you're all we have now.

720
00:38:46,683 --> 00:38:49,194
Of course, Auntie.

721
00:38:49,623 --> 00:38:52,470
We should accept it
for this family's sake.

722
00:38:52,494 --> 00:38:54,624
How could I be selfish
in this matter?

723
00:38:55,694 --> 00:38:58,934
Jin Dan, if your brother
agrees to this,

724
00:38:59,163 --> 00:39:00,504
we'll accept it.

725
00:39:01,764 --> 00:39:03,104
But Mom...

726
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:11,843
Mom, come on.

727
00:39:12,143 --> 00:39:15,013
How can you want me to be his son?

728
00:39:15,214 --> 00:39:16,484
That's humiliating.

729
00:39:16,484 --> 00:39:18,353
As if being humiliated
matters right now.

730
00:39:18,353 --> 00:39:19,953
Once you become his adopted son,

731
00:39:19,953 --> 00:39:22,754
you will own APP Group
down the road.

732
00:39:24,293 --> 00:39:26,493
If he agrees to adopt you,

733
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,523
that means
he'll give the group to you...

734
00:39:28,523 --> 00:39:30,363
and not to Ma Ri's future husband.

735
00:39:31,034 --> 00:39:33,639
Jin Dan, being adopted by him...

736
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:35,304
won't mean you aren't
my son as well.

737
00:39:35,304 --> 00:39:37,033
Let's do that, Jin Dan.

738
00:39:37,734 --> 00:39:40,403
I can't believe your aunt
actually thought of that.

739
00:39:40,703 --> 00:39:42,613
She must be a genius.

740
00:39:42,873 --> 00:39:44,914
Isn't she a wise woman?

741
00:39:51,748 --> 00:39:55,334
My gosh. What just happened?

742
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,830
Jin Dan will someday own APP Group.

743
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,670
Am I dreaming or what?

744
00:40:01,843 --> 00:40:05,283
I hope Chairman Gong
quickly decides to accept Jin Dan...

745
00:40:05,283 --> 00:40:07,143
as his adopted son.

746
00:40:11,323 --> 00:40:12,652
Gosh.

747
00:40:13,522 --> 00:40:15,123
Hey, Sang Gu. It's me.

748
00:40:17,122 --> 00:40:19,563
What? You're where?

749
00:40:29,502 --> 00:40:30,733
Ae Kyo.

750
00:40:35,573 --> 00:40:36,773
Sang Gu.

751
00:40:48,452 --> 00:40:49,952
How did you know to come here?

752
00:40:50,222 --> 00:40:51,992
Are you kidding me?

753
00:40:52,193 --> 00:40:54,833
You. Get out of my house!

754
00:40:57,863 --> 00:40:59,379
Why that...

755
00:40:59,403 --> 00:41:00,663
Cut, okay.

756
00:41:01,332 --> 00:41:02,432
We'll go
with Yeon Doo's close-up shot.

757
00:41:02,432 --> 00:41:04,603
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

758
00:41:04,972 --> 00:41:06,742
I'm fine.

759
00:41:07,443 --> 00:41:09,673
How dare she slap my Ji Young?

760
00:41:09,673 --> 00:41:11,513
- I'm sorry.
- You could've slapped me harder.

761
00:41:11,513 --> 00:41:13,542
- Did she have to slap her so hard?
- It turned red.

762
00:41:13,542 --> 00:41:15,983
- I'm truly fine.
- I'm really sorry.

763
00:41:16,113 --> 00:41:18,823
Hey, Bong Soo. That actress Na Bi...

764
00:41:18,823 --> 00:41:20,083
Jin Dan.

765
00:41:20,153 --> 00:41:22,393
I'd rather
you not speak to me anymore.

766
00:41:22,852 --> 00:41:25,262
People like you are those I loathe.

767
00:41:26,222 --> 00:41:28,492
- Gosh, hello.
- Hi.

768
00:41:29,963 --> 00:41:31,533
Hi, there.

769
00:41:31,533 --> 00:41:33,132
Hi.

770
00:41:35,972 --> 00:41:38,143
Cha Bong Soo, what's with you?

771
00:41:49,912 --> 00:41:51,722
We'll go
with Yeon Doo's close-up shot.

772
00:42:02,162 --> 00:42:04,163
Unbelievable.

773
00:42:05,832 --> 00:42:07,772
Is everyone choosing to ignore me?

774
00:42:07,772 --> 00:42:09,602
We'll do that again,

775
00:42:09,602 --> 00:42:11,472
but don't force it this time.

776
00:42:11,472 --> 00:42:13,842
Don't they know
who pays their salaries?

777
00:42:14,312 --> 00:42:16,543
How dare they ignore me?

778
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,443
You.

779
00:42:19,642 --> 00:42:21,813
What do you even do around here?

780
00:42:22,952 --> 00:42:24,853
I'm the CEO of GOGO Entertainment.

781
00:42:25,452 --> 00:42:26,799
When I'm seen,

782
00:42:26,823 --> 00:42:30,123
I should be bowed down to
by the director and the staff.

783
00:42:30,892 --> 00:42:32,963
I pay their salaries...

784
00:42:33,423 --> 00:42:35,262
and the cost is covered
by the company,

785
00:42:35,863 --> 00:42:37,239
but they audaciously ignore me.

786
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,379
I apologize, sir.

787
00:42:38,403 --> 00:42:40,062
Next time,
I'll make sure they greet you.

788
00:42:40,062 --> 00:42:42,103
This is all because of Ko Pil Seung!

789
00:42:42,633 --> 00:42:45,702
They all look down on me
because the director does.

790
00:42:46,702 --> 00:42:50,373
From now on,
make sure Ko Pil Seung is educated,

791
00:42:51,082 --> 00:42:53,612
or you'll be the first one
to lose your job.

792
00:42:54,682 --> 00:42:57,112
Also, bring me the screenplay.

793
00:42:57,952 --> 00:43:00,623
I'm going to have
to go over it myself.

794
00:43:12,263 --> 00:43:14,163
Yes, there it is.

795
00:43:14,803 --> 00:43:15,972
Here.

796
00:43:15,972 --> 00:43:19,149
Omit the scene where Na Bi
slaps Kim Ji Young.

797
00:43:19,173 --> 00:43:20,543
Unbelievable.

798
00:43:21,213 --> 00:43:24,072
How can two women
slap each other like animals?

799
00:43:24,142 --> 00:43:28,313
I won't allow that
in a series I'm producing.

800
00:43:29,053 --> 00:43:30,253
Also,

801
00:43:31,153 --> 00:43:32,652
cut Cha Bong Soo from the show.

802
00:43:33,222 --> 00:43:34,952
Kill him off in a car accident...

803
00:43:34,952 --> 00:43:36,522
or send him to study abroad.

804
00:43:36,522 --> 00:43:37,638
Sir.

805
00:43:37,662 --> 00:43:40,963
Cha Bong Soo is the male lead,
so how can he be cut from the show?

806
00:43:40,963 --> 00:43:42,163
What?

807
00:43:44,932 --> 00:43:47,902
Because I told you to.
Is that so hard to understand?

808
00:43:48,502 --> 00:43:52,202
That guy with the ponytail.
Park Jin Soo, was it?

809
00:43:52,372 --> 00:43:54,202
Have him be the lead instead.

810
00:43:55,042 --> 00:43:56,542
Have the writer
rewrite her script...

811
00:43:56,542 --> 00:43:58,913
and film the scenes again
starting with episode 12.

812
00:43:59,312 --> 00:44:00,512
Got it?

813
00:44:01,213 --> 00:44:02,452
Sir.

814
00:44:03,812 --> 00:44:05,052
What did you just say?

815
00:44:05,483 --> 00:44:07,452
The male lead's character
should be sent abroad to study?

816
00:44:07,823 --> 00:44:09,023
That's right.

817
00:44:09,122 --> 00:44:11,762
Or you should kill him off
with a car accident.

818
00:44:11,792 --> 00:44:13,623
Did Mr. Gong actually say that?

819
00:44:14,263 --> 00:44:15,492
Yes.

820
00:44:16,763 --> 00:44:18,402
Unbelievable.

821
00:44:20,102 --> 00:44:21,333
Seriously?

822
00:44:21,803 --> 00:44:23,603
You call this drama?

823
00:44:24,843 --> 00:44:26,642
Are you telling me
she got paid that much...

824
00:44:26,642 --> 00:44:28,612
for writing scenes that are a joke?

825
00:44:29,142 --> 00:44:30,413
Unbelievable.

826
00:44:31,013 --> 00:44:33,413
I could write better scenes
in my sleep.

827
00:44:37,113 --> 00:44:39,683
Hey, you're just the person
I wanted to see.

828
00:44:41,122 --> 00:44:42,992
I had a lot to say to you.

829
00:44:44,022 --> 00:44:45,263
Did you order the scene
in episode 12...

830
00:44:45,263 --> 00:44:46,693
where Kim Ji Young gets slapped...

831
00:44:47,323 --> 00:44:48,933
to be omitted?

832
00:44:49,463 --> 00:44:51,663
That's right. Omit that scene.

833
00:44:52,463 --> 00:44:55,733
How can two women get into it
by slapping one another?

834
00:44:55,733 --> 00:44:57,003
It's barbaric.

835
00:44:57,432 --> 00:44:59,848
Look.
Korean shows are being aired...

836
00:44:59,872 --> 00:45:01,512
all over the world.

837
00:45:02,243 --> 00:45:04,042
If foreigners were to watch this,

838
00:45:04,042 --> 00:45:06,012
how unsophisticated
would they think we are?

839
00:45:07,812 --> 00:45:09,112
Step aside.

840
00:45:11,153 --> 00:45:14,282
"Unsophisticated?"
Is that what you called me?

841
00:45:15,053 --> 00:45:17,523
I'm not saying
you're unsophisticated.

842
00:45:17,662 --> 00:45:20,193
I'm saying
the contents of the script are.

843
00:45:20,193 --> 00:45:21,562
It's the same thing.

844
00:45:21,562 --> 00:45:22,739
Also,

845
00:45:22,763 --> 00:45:25,433
is it true you want Cha Bong Soo's
character to go abroad?

846
00:45:25,633 --> 00:45:26,739
Yes, it is.

847
00:45:26,763 --> 00:45:28,773
The plot needs him to go.

848
00:45:29,872 --> 00:45:32,202
I don't believe this.

849
00:45:32,843 --> 00:45:35,213
I've never met someone
this darn ignorant.

850
00:45:35,213 --> 00:45:37,742
What... What did you say?

851
00:45:38,483 --> 00:45:40,213
- "Darn ignorant?"
- Yes.

852
00:45:40,443 --> 00:45:43,658
I called you that because that's
what you are, you ignorant fool.

853
00:45:43,682 --> 00:45:44,882
My gosh.

854
00:45:47,823 --> 00:45:49,693
A woman like this writes scripts?

855
00:45:50,493 --> 00:45:54,408
Did you read even a full line
of the script properly?

856
00:45:54,432 --> 00:45:56,768
Do you know anything
about TV dramas?

857
00:45:56,792 --> 00:45:59,132
Cha Bong Soo's the male lead
until episode 11.

858
00:45:59,363 --> 00:46:01,609
How can we suddenly kill him off?

859
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:03,779
Not even a stray dog
would want that.

860
00:46:03,803 --> 00:46:05,272
Don't act like one.

861
00:46:05,272 --> 00:46:06,572
You're mad, woman.

862
00:46:07,173 --> 00:46:10,348
How dare you liken me
to a stray dog?

863
00:46:10,372 --> 00:46:12,959
If you speak like that
to me once more,

864
00:46:12,983 --> 00:46:14,452
I'll have you replaced!

865
00:46:14,452 --> 00:46:17,728
Fine. Do it. Replace me.

866
00:46:17,752 --> 00:46:19,853
I make enough without this project.

867
00:46:20,082 --> 00:46:23,328
If I stay on a project even though
someone toys with my script,

868
00:46:23,352 --> 00:46:25,362
I swear I'll change my name!

869
00:46:26,122 --> 00:46:28,592
You can't do this
in this day and age.

870
00:46:28,693 --> 00:46:31,433
Not even upstarts act like this,
you ignorant fool!

871
00:46:31,863 --> 00:46:33,702
Ms. Kim, that's enough.

872
00:46:34,472 --> 00:46:37,303
This crass woman's a scriptwriter?

873
00:46:37,303 --> 00:46:38,603
Mr. Gong!

874
00:46:39,073 --> 00:46:40,702
What are you playing at?

875
00:46:41,412 --> 00:46:44,683
We work in specific fields,
and you can't say who we axe or add.

876
00:46:45,513 --> 00:46:47,612
Why intrude on the writer's job?

877
00:46:48,153 --> 00:46:50,512
Why intrude on the director's job?

878
00:46:51,752 --> 00:46:53,098
Watch your basic manners.

879
00:46:53,122 --> 00:46:55,893
What? My basic manners?

880
00:46:56,153 --> 00:46:58,623
Are you saying
I don't know the basics?

881
00:46:59,463 --> 00:47:02,393
You work for GOGO Entertainment.
Do as the CEO says!

882
00:47:03,033 --> 00:47:04,393
That's your job!

883
00:47:05,702 --> 00:47:07,103
I can't do that.

884
00:47:07,463 --> 00:47:09,373
I'll stick to Ms. Kim's script.

885
00:47:09,872 --> 00:47:11,373
Let's go.

886
00:47:11,702 --> 00:47:13,902
I'm infuriated. That ignorant fool.

887
00:47:14,202 --> 00:47:15,413
Darn it.

888
00:47:16,472 --> 00:47:18,612
Hey, you. Fine.

889
00:47:18,682 --> 00:47:21,183
You! I'll fire you all.

890
00:47:21,513 --> 00:47:24,753
Ko Pil Seung, Kim Oh Kyeong!
I'll fire you all!

891
00:47:32,022 --> 00:47:34,463
- Oh, my gosh.
- I don't want an operation!

892
00:47:34,463 --> 00:47:36,933
- I don't like injections!
- Calm down, Ma Ri.

893
00:47:37,463 --> 00:47:40,709
- Go away. Get off me.
- Calm down, Ma Ri.

894
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:43,478
- Relax.
- What's wrong, Ma Ri?

895
00:47:43,502 --> 00:47:44,873
- Ma Ri.
- What is it, Ma Ri?

896
00:47:45,472 --> 00:47:48,049
Go away! I don't want an operation!

897
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:49,448
I'm scared of injections!

898
00:47:49,472 --> 00:47:51,382
Ma Ri.

899
00:47:52,443 --> 00:47:54,182
I want to go to Mom.

900
00:47:54,182 --> 00:47:55,452
- Where's Mom?
- Ma Ri!

901
00:47:55,452 --> 00:47:56,888
Mom, I'm sick.

902
00:47:56,912 --> 00:48:00,029
Mom, Ma Ri's sick! Mom!

903
00:48:00,053 --> 00:48:02,193
Mom!

904
00:48:02,252 --> 00:48:04,422
- Oh, dear...
- Ma Ri...

905
00:48:04,722 --> 00:48:06,222
- Oh, gosh.
- Mom!

906
00:48:06,222 --> 00:48:09,169
Come and get me, Mom.

907
00:48:09,193 --> 00:48:11,193
Where's Mom?

908
00:48:12,403 --> 00:48:14,578
What? Ma Ri's screaming?

909
00:48:14,602 --> 00:48:17,049
Yes.
Chairman Gong wants you here now.

910
00:48:17,073 --> 00:48:18,472
Ma Ri's not well at all.

911
00:48:18,903 --> 00:48:20,443
Okay. I'll come right over.

912
00:48:38,323 --> 00:48:40,862
It's post-traumatic stress disorder?

913
00:48:41,463 --> 00:48:42,663
Yes.

914
00:48:42,832 --> 00:48:46,463
It's a psychological condition
some get after experiencing...

915
00:48:47,062 --> 00:48:50,802
a serious accident
or trauma like she did.

916
00:48:52,303 --> 00:48:55,018
I'm thinking
she recently suffered from...

917
00:48:55,042 --> 00:48:57,472
a great deal of stress or shock.

918
00:48:59,713 --> 00:49:03,012
It caused memories
of her accident to resurface.

919
00:49:03,682 --> 00:49:05,683
She needs absolute rest.

920
00:49:06,182 --> 00:49:07,928
If it gets any worse,

921
00:49:07,952 --> 00:49:11,098
she might be unable
to function normally.

922
00:49:11,122 --> 00:49:12,523
Be very careful.

923
00:49:15,292 --> 00:49:17,803
Fortunately, though,
she seems to calm down...

924
00:49:17,803 --> 00:49:21,003
around Ms. Jang enough
to allow injections and to talk.

925
00:49:21,673 --> 00:49:23,303
For a while,

926
00:49:23,303 --> 00:49:25,972
you should stay with her, ma'am.

927
00:49:26,303 --> 00:49:28,313
Okay. I'll do that.

928
00:49:29,312 --> 00:49:30,612
I'll be with her.

929
00:49:34,412 --> 00:49:35,983
I'll keep Ma Ri with me.

930
00:49:36,613 --> 00:49:38,899
At least for a while,
until she calms down.

931
00:49:38,923 --> 00:49:42,193
Yes. What else can we do
when she needs her mom?

932
00:49:42,622 --> 00:49:44,592
You aren't taking her anywhere.

933
00:49:45,093 --> 00:49:46,362
You can't.

934
00:49:47,522 --> 00:49:48,933
Not even for a while.

935
00:49:49,233 --> 00:49:52,362
You want her to suffer like this?
Relying on sedatives?

936
00:49:54,102 --> 00:49:57,503
What if what Dr. Kim said
comes true and Ma Ri...

937
00:49:57,573 --> 00:50:01,172
becomes unable to function
like she used to?

938
00:50:01,443 --> 00:50:02,672
What?

939
00:50:03,472 --> 00:50:04,882
You don't know...

940
00:50:06,013 --> 00:50:08,713
how much Ma Ri suffered
when she was admitted.

941
00:50:09,312 --> 00:50:10,682
You don't know
what she went through...

942
00:50:10,682 --> 00:50:13,522
so she could become well enough
and act the way she did.

943
00:50:13,522 --> 00:50:15,122
You don't know it all.

944
00:50:15,122 --> 00:50:17,853
And she might revert
to that condition.

945
00:50:18,662 --> 00:50:20,092
I can't let her.

946
00:50:20,162 --> 00:50:23,469
I can't let Ma Ri
suffer like that again.

947
00:50:23,493 --> 00:50:24,733
Honey.

948
00:50:25,602 --> 00:50:28,302
Let me take her with me, please.

949
00:50:28,733 --> 00:50:30,472
I can't do that.

950
00:50:31,472 --> 00:50:32,902
You move back.

951
00:50:34,613 --> 00:50:37,913
You stay here until Ma Ri's better.

952
00:50:38,182 --> 00:50:41,452
Chairman Gong. What are you saying?

953
00:50:44,053 --> 00:50:47,759
Are you going to reconcile with her
because of Ma Ri?

954
00:50:47,783 --> 00:50:50,023
No, we will get divorced.

955
00:50:50,153 --> 00:50:51,393
We won't reconcile.

956
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:55,793
I can't let you take Ma Ri.

957
00:50:56,292 --> 00:50:57,563
Not even for a day.

958
00:50:58,033 --> 00:50:59,332
So move back...

959
00:50:59,332 --> 00:51:02,902
and nurse her back to health
if you have a conscience.

960
00:51:08,113 --> 00:51:09,373
He's right.

961
00:51:09,872 --> 00:51:13,012
It's your fault
Ma Ri ended up like this.

962
00:51:13,713 --> 00:51:18,152
How dare you act so righteous
to sit with your head held high?

963
00:51:18,783 --> 00:51:22,822
My goodness.
How can someone be so shameless?

964
00:51:23,993 --> 00:51:25,222
Goodness.

965
00:51:37,832 --> 00:51:39,202
Mom.

966
00:51:39,542 --> 00:51:42,542
How could he let her stay with us?

967
00:51:42,542 --> 00:51:45,083
I don't get it either.
She's a nutcase.

968
00:51:45,682 --> 00:51:46,682
Jin Dan.

969
00:51:46,682 --> 00:51:49,852
What should we do
if they patch things up?

970
00:51:49,852 --> 00:51:52,952
No, Jin Taek's not that soft, Mom.

971
00:51:54,022 --> 00:51:56,268
I wish the two of them
could go far away,

972
00:51:56,292 --> 00:51:58,293
like to the US.

973
00:51:58,423 --> 00:52:00,163
I don't like this.

974
00:52:01,662 --> 00:52:02,893
Chairman Gong.

975
00:52:03,633 --> 00:52:06,702
It breaks my heart
to see Ma Ri like that.

976
00:52:07,533 --> 00:52:11,702
But then my heart sinks
as other issues come to mind.

977
00:52:12,272 --> 00:52:15,873
What will happen
to our family and company?

978
00:52:16,272 --> 00:52:17,813
I'm so worried.

979
00:52:20,243 --> 00:52:21,443
Did you...

980
00:52:22,312 --> 00:52:24,853
think about what I said?

981
00:52:27,423 --> 00:52:28,693
Auntie.

982
00:52:29,153 --> 00:52:31,092
I'd love to...

983
00:52:31,693 --> 00:52:33,862
leave everything to Jin Dan...

984
00:52:33,892 --> 00:52:36,663
and go somewhere far away.

985
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:40,638
But it's not that simple an issue.

986
00:52:40,662 --> 00:52:43,032
Then find a new wife.

987
00:52:45,173 --> 00:52:47,072
I'm sick of women now.

988
00:52:48,142 --> 00:52:50,413
The woman I loved
turned out to be a mess.

989
00:52:50,772 --> 00:52:53,643
No woman forced upon me
would work out.

990
00:52:54,783 --> 00:52:56,413
Chairman Gong.

991
00:52:56,812 --> 00:53:01,282
The best option for us
would be for you to adopt Jin Dan.

992
00:53:02,323 --> 00:53:06,722
He'll soon marry the daughter
of Illyu Foods' chairman.

993
00:53:07,222 --> 00:53:10,063
And Angel Investment Corp.
is doing okay.

994
00:53:10,733 --> 00:53:12,402
More than anything,
he's related to me.

995
00:53:14,033 --> 00:53:17,933
Doesn't that make him
a better option than a stranger?

996
00:53:19,243 --> 00:53:20,503
Yes.

997
00:53:21,972 --> 00:53:24,443
I'll think about it some more.

998
00:53:28,153 --> 00:53:31,983
Did you think
about being adopted by your brother?

999
00:53:32,653 --> 00:53:35,593
If you're against it, say so now
instead of way down the line.

1000
00:53:35,593 --> 00:53:38,123
Why would we be against it?
We're not, Auntie.

1001
00:53:38,193 --> 00:53:40,669
We decided to follow...

1002
00:53:40,693 --> 00:53:42,992
whatever decision you made.

1003
00:53:43,463 --> 00:53:44,893
Right, Jin Dan?

1004
00:53:45,303 --> 00:53:47,632
Well... Yes.

1005
00:53:48,303 --> 00:53:49,503
Really?

1006
00:53:50,002 --> 00:53:51,572
Auntie.

1007
00:53:51,702 --> 00:53:53,802
Seeing Ma Ri's condition...

1008
00:53:53,943 --> 00:53:57,018
convinced me that the chairman...

1009
00:53:57,042 --> 00:54:00,713
should adopt Jin Dan so he could
take charge of the family.

1010
00:54:01,013 --> 00:54:02,753
What can I do...

1011
00:54:02,883 --> 00:54:05,452
but sacrifice my wishes
for the household?

1012
00:54:06,582 --> 00:54:10,253
Yes. I think our family and company
should come first.

1013
00:54:11,093 --> 00:54:12,793
That's right.

1014
00:54:13,323 --> 00:54:14,963
Being adopted doesn't mean...

1015
00:54:14,963 --> 00:54:17,233
you'll part with your mom for good.

1016
00:54:19,303 --> 00:54:21,872
I have to get back to work
to handle things.

1017
00:54:21,872 --> 00:54:23,072
Okay.

1018
00:54:33,182 --> 00:54:35,252
The phone is turned off.

1019
00:54:35,252 --> 00:54:36,812
- She's not answering.
- After the tone,

1020
00:54:36,812 --> 00:54:38,452
you will be connected
to the voicemail.

1021
00:54:38,452 --> 00:54:40,452
- She must be really sick.
- Charges will apply...

1022
00:54:40,452 --> 00:54:41,893
after the connection.

1023
00:54:44,022 --> 00:54:45,363
We're home.

1024
00:54:45,363 --> 00:54:46,722
- Hey.
- Hello.

1025
00:54:46,722 --> 00:54:48,932
Pil Seung, you're all back together.

1026
00:54:48,932 --> 00:54:50,563
Yes. We met outside.

1027
00:54:50,792 --> 00:54:53,563
Pil Seung. Sun Young.

1028
00:54:54,602 --> 00:54:58,072
I met Ms. Yeoju a moment ago
while I was out getting groceries.

1029
00:54:58,303 --> 00:55:00,172
She said Ma Ri was very ill.

1030
00:55:00,772 --> 00:55:03,673
How she was ill before
is just nothing compared to this.

1031
00:55:03,673 --> 00:55:05,242
Apparently,
she is seriously ill now.

1032
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:08,113
She can barely swallow even water.

1033
00:55:08,113 --> 00:55:09,413
She keeps throwing up.

1034
00:55:09,752 --> 00:55:12,422
- Ma Ri is ill?
- Why? What's wrong?

1035
00:55:12,852 --> 00:55:15,093
Ms. Yeoju says...

1036
00:55:15,093 --> 00:55:18,393
she seems to be in deep shock.

1037
00:55:18,863 --> 00:55:21,193
She refuses to see a doctor...

1038
00:55:21,193 --> 00:55:23,709
or get an injection.

1039
00:55:23,733 --> 00:55:27,132
It turned the whole family
upside down.

1040
00:55:27,832 --> 00:55:30,308
What if something serious
happens to Ma Ri?

1041
00:55:30,332 --> 00:55:31,943
Oh, dear.

1042
00:55:32,943 --> 00:55:35,173
The phone is turned off.

1043
00:55:35,173 --> 00:55:38,742
After the tone, you will be
connected to the voicemail.

1044
00:55:41,653 --> 00:55:43,022
(Ms. Jang)

1045
00:55:54,932 --> 00:55:58,682
Hello. It's you, Pil Seung.

1046
00:56:00,363 --> 00:56:03,352
Is Ma Ri seriously ill?

1047
00:56:08,213 --> 00:56:09,493
Yes.

1048
00:56:10,372 --> 00:56:12,932
It's post-traumatic stress disorder.

1049
00:56:13,682 --> 00:56:16,062
Post-traumatic stress disorder?

1050
00:56:18,283 --> 00:56:19,952
It's all my fault.

1051
00:56:19,952 --> 00:56:22,642
She's deeply hurt because of me.

1052
00:56:24,022 --> 00:56:27,443
Can I talk to her
if she's with you now?

1053
00:56:28,363 --> 00:56:31,852
She is sleeping under sedation now.

1054
00:56:32,702 --> 00:56:34,553
Without sedation,

1055
00:56:35,102 --> 00:56:36,952
she is in too much pain.

1056
00:56:39,303 --> 00:56:41,823
But why aren't you
taking her to a doctor?

1057
00:56:42,312 --> 00:56:45,989
It is an illness of the mind.

1058
00:56:46,013 --> 00:56:48,093
Things can be serious and urgent.

1059
00:56:48,412 --> 00:56:51,162
You're right. We're aware of that.

1060
00:56:54,222 --> 00:56:57,173
After the car accident,

1061
00:56:57,923 --> 00:57:00,522
Ma Ri had to go through
arduous procedures...

1062
00:57:00,522 --> 00:57:02,613
that even grown-ups can't handle.

1063
00:57:03,463 --> 00:57:05,852
And while she was in the hospital,

1064
00:57:06,263 --> 00:57:08,983
she had to get numerous shots.

1065
00:57:10,573 --> 00:57:13,403
So she hates going to a hospital,

1066
00:57:13,403 --> 00:57:15,493
so I'm having her doctor come over.

1067
00:57:16,843 --> 00:57:18,562
I see.

1068
00:57:20,582 --> 00:57:22,733
By the way, Pil Seung,

1069
00:57:23,613 --> 00:57:27,502
I'm sorry to say this,

1070
00:57:29,722 --> 00:57:31,843
but Ma Ri keeps saying...

1071
00:57:32,162 --> 00:57:35,443
that she misses you
whenever she's awake.

1072
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:38,808
Me?

1073
00:57:38,832 --> 00:57:40,082
Yes.

1074
00:57:40,932 --> 00:57:44,352
If she could go out,
I would take her to meet you.

1075
00:57:44,903 --> 00:57:48,622
But she's not in a condition
where she can go out.

1076
00:57:50,673 --> 00:57:51,963
Pil Seung.

1077
00:57:52,613 --> 00:57:54,792
What should I do with Ma Ri?

1078
00:58:25,513 --> 00:58:26,993
All right.

1079
00:58:37,452 --> 00:58:39,343
What are you doing here?

1080
00:58:40,823 --> 00:58:42,582
I heard Ma Ri was ill,

1081
00:58:43,162 --> 00:58:44,513
so I came to see her.

1082
00:58:45,463 --> 00:58:48,883
Whether she is ill or not
has nothing to do with you.

1083
00:58:51,002 --> 00:58:52,049
I'm sorry.

1084
00:58:52,073 --> 00:58:54,653
I think I told you
to stop seeing her.

1085
00:58:54,943 --> 00:58:56,463
How dare you show up here?

1086
00:58:57,472 --> 00:58:58,863
Leave this instant.

1087
00:58:59,042 --> 00:59:01,093
And do not show your face
around here again.

1088
00:59:15,763 --> 00:59:17,582
How is Ma Ri?

1089
00:59:18,193 --> 00:59:19,582
Is it still bad?

1090
00:59:21,002 --> 00:59:22,779
She can't even swallow water.

1091
00:59:22,803 --> 00:59:25,622
You should talk to her
so we can take her to a hospital.

1092
00:59:25,943 --> 00:59:28,722
At this rate,
she will soon be in big trouble.

1093
00:59:41,823 --> 00:59:43,392
Look, Ma Ri.

1094
00:59:43,392 --> 00:59:45,843
I bought all your favorite snacks.

1095
00:59:46,363 --> 00:59:49,343
Look at that.
They are your favorite.

1096
00:59:49,693 --> 00:59:52,613
Ma Ri, do you want
some custard pudding?

1097
00:59:53,702 --> 00:59:56,752
Or strawberry cake?

1098
01:00:01,002 --> 01:00:03,213
Ma Ri, you have to eat something.

1099
01:00:03,213 --> 01:00:05,288
You could get really ill.

1100
01:00:05,312 --> 01:00:08,863
If you keep being like this,
you'll have to go to a hospital.

1101
01:00:09,983 --> 01:00:13,472
No! I'm not going to a hospital.
I don't even like the smell.

1102
01:00:14,252 --> 01:00:17,698
Get out, Dad. I don't want you
to tell me to go to a hospital.

1103
01:00:17,722 --> 01:00:18,722
I hate you!

1104
01:00:18,722 --> 01:00:21,292
All right, Ma Ri.
It's all right. Calm down.

1105
01:00:21,292 --> 01:00:23,763
You're not going to a hospital,
okay?

1106
01:00:23,763 --> 01:00:25,263
- You're not going.
- Right. I'm sorry, Ma Ri.

1107
01:00:25,263 --> 01:00:27,363
I won't say that again.

1108
01:00:27,363 --> 01:00:29,582
Never again.

1109
01:00:31,073 --> 01:00:32,323
Ma Ri.

1110
01:00:32,673 --> 01:00:34,472
You should at least have some water.

1111
01:00:34,472 --> 01:00:36,312
You need to drink water.

1112
01:00:36,312 --> 01:00:37,763
Honey, get her some water.

1113
01:00:38,142 --> 01:00:39,392
Okay.

1114
01:00:39,743 --> 01:00:40,993
Here.

1115
01:00:43,752 --> 01:00:45,328
Go ahead and drink it.

1116
01:00:45,352 --> 01:00:48,432
Just try to drink it a little.

1117
01:00:51,622 --> 01:00:54,513
Have some water
and try to eat the cake.

1118
01:00:57,162 --> 01:00:58,502
- Ma Ri.
- Ma Ri.

1119
01:00:58,502 --> 01:01:00,602
You should at least have some water.

1120
01:01:00,602 --> 01:01:02,952
Why are you being like this?

1121
01:01:04,233 --> 01:01:05,593
Dad.

1122
01:01:06,002 --> 01:01:08,392
I want to drink it.

1123
01:01:09,142 --> 01:01:12,533
But I just can't force it down.

1124
01:01:14,983 --> 01:01:16,303
What?

1125
01:01:17,013 --> 01:01:19,222
I do want to drink water...

1126
01:01:19,222 --> 01:01:21,472
and get better.

1127
01:01:22,222 --> 01:01:24,542
But I just can't help it.

1128
01:01:25,193 --> 01:01:27,113
So it hurts...

1129
01:01:27,363 --> 01:01:30,082
It really hurts here.

1130
01:01:33,803 --> 01:01:35,053
Dad.

1131
01:01:36,602 --> 01:01:40,722
I really miss Pil Seung.

1132
01:01:42,113 --> 01:01:44,622
Can't we have him come over?

1133
01:02:01,263 --> 01:02:02,693
(Chairman Gong Jin Taek)

1134
01:02:06,403 --> 01:02:08,582
Hello. Ko Pil Seung speaking.

1135
01:02:09,272 --> 01:02:11,553
Where are you now?

1136
01:02:12,303 --> 01:02:13,622
I'm on my way home.

1137
01:02:14,372 --> 01:02:16,363
My Ma Ri is...

1138
01:02:18,113 --> 01:02:19,392
quite ill now.

1139
01:02:19,582 --> 01:02:21,493
And she wants to see you.

1140
01:02:22,682 --> 01:02:25,673
Can you come over to my place now?

1141
01:02:26,053 --> 01:02:27,372
Please.

1142
01:02:45,133 --> 01:02:46,852
Chairman Gong got off early today.

1143
01:02:50,513 --> 01:02:51,792
I know.

1144
01:02:52,443 --> 01:02:54,763
You may leave, Mr. Kim.

1145
01:03:02,792 --> 01:03:04,872
You're the only one we have
in our family now.

1146
01:03:07,993 --> 01:03:09,633
Your brother's too old...

1147
01:03:09,633 --> 01:03:11,443
to marry someone new
and raise a successor.

1148
01:03:11,693 --> 01:03:14,082
It's wiser to just adopt you
as his son.

1149
01:03:25,843 --> 01:03:26,943
(Chairman Gong Jin Taek)

1150
01:03:30,582 --> 01:03:31,903
That's right.

1151
01:03:32,323 --> 01:03:33,702
This seat...

1152
01:03:34,252 --> 01:03:35,743
will belong to me.

1153
01:03:36,892 --> 01:03:38,743
To Gong Jin Dan.

1154
01:03:57,443 --> 01:03:58,863
Hey, Ko Pil Seung.

1155
01:03:59,912 --> 01:04:02,193
How dare you come here?

1156
01:04:13,292 --> 01:04:15,993
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1157
01:04:48,263 --> 01:04:49,669
Jin Taek wants to talk to me.

1158
01:04:49,693 --> 01:04:51,932
I think he wants
to discuss adoption.

1159
01:04:51,932 --> 01:04:54,209
Mom, should I be his adopted son?

1160
01:04:54,233 --> 01:04:55,533
Thanks to "The House of Roses,"

1161
01:04:55,533 --> 01:04:58,308
produced by our subsidiary,
GOGO Entertainment,

1162
01:04:58,332 --> 01:05:00,843
APP Group has grown
in status and reputation a lot.

1163
01:05:00,843 --> 01:05:02,213
As if I don't know
what you're scheming.

1164
01:05:02,213 --> 01:05:04,018
Now that the cat's out of the bag,

1165
01:05:04,042 --> 01:05:05,042
you're trying to take advantage
of the stupid Ma Ri...

1166
01:05:05,042 --> 01:05:06,292
to score a position in the company.

1167
01:05:07,383 --> 01:05:08,788
Watch your words.

1168
01:05:08,812 --> 01:05:12,852
Ji Young is head over heels
for another man.

1169
01:05:12,852 --> 01:05:15,228
You should move on.

1170
01:05:15,252 --> 01:05:17,629
- I'm sorry.
- Don't date Mr. Gong.

1171
01:05:17,653 --> 01:05:19,399
He's not a good man for you.

1172
01:05:19,423 --> 01:05:22,768
Once you regain your memories,
you'll know why I'm saying this.

1173
01:05:22,792 --> 01:05:24,142
Ji Young!

1174
01:05:27,028 --> 01:05:29,249
