1
00:00:00,104 --> 00:00:07,372
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:11,472
Why are you being this way?

3
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:13,272
It's because I like you.

4
00:00:14,542 --> 00:00:15,542
Sorry?

5
00:00:16,482 --> 00:00:17,542
Ji Young,

6
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:19,382
go out with me.

7
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:22,751
What?

8
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:27,752
If you can't answer me right now,

9
00:00:27,992 --> 00:00:29,792
give it some thought
and then make up your mind.

10
00:00:30,461 --> 00:00:31,932
We still have two more meals
to enjoy.

11
00:00:32,362 --> 00:00:34,461
Think about it during that time
and tell me...

12
00:00:35,432 --> 00:00:36,461
if you'll be my girlfriend.

13
00:00:37,301 --> 00:00:39,932
Until then, I won't pressure you
for an answer.

14
00:00:40,932 --> 00:00:41,941
But...

15
00:00:42,701 --> 00:00:46,441
Right, then.
I'll give it some thought.

16
00:00:46,572 --> 00:00:49,381
It seems as though
I got the green light for now.

17
00:00:50,011 --> 00:00:51,011
Then, accept these.

18
00:00:51,011 --> 00:00:52,752
No, I can't.

19
00:00:53,182 --> 00:00:54,481
I can't accept those right now.

20
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:57,121
I will when I agree
to be your girlfriend.

21
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:01,021
This outfit you got me
is more than enough.

22
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:02,491
I mean that.

23
00:01:03,422 --> 00:01:04,962
This is exactly why I like you.

24
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:06,892
Sure. Do that, then.

25
00:01:07,462 --> 00:01:09,402
I'll get going.
I'll call you tomorrow.

26
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:10,902
Sure.

27
00:01:11,102 --> 00:01:12,872
Gosh, these are heavy.

28
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:14,872
If only you'd soon take these.

29
00:01:17,342 --> 00:01:18,372
Good night.

30
00:01:28,452 --> 00:01:30,051
What just happened?

31
00:01:36,392 --> 00:01:37,562
What the...

32
00:01:40,491 --> 00:01:41,562
Director Ko,

33
00:01:42,032 --> 00:01:43,661
why are you standing there...

34
00:01:43,661 --> 00:01:46,301
like a ghost
that lurks around in the night?

35
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:48,502
You're such a weird one.

36
00:01:48,502 --> 00:01:50,601
My heart almost dropped.

37
00:01:58,211 --> 00:01:59,211
Ji Young.

38
00:02:00,252 --> 00:02:01,722
Didn't this big brother of yours...

39
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:03,181
tell you not to get a ride
from just any guy?

40
00:02:04,021 --> 00:02:05,722
Why are you ignoring what I said?

41
00:02:05,722 --> 00:02:08,422
What did you just say?

42
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:10,562
What the...

43
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:13,562
Who are you referring to
as my brother?

44
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:16,061
You're unbelievable.

45
00:02:16,801 --> 00:02:18,702
Starting today,
I will be that for you.

46
00:02:19,271 --> 00:02:22,371
It seems as though you need
a big brother to protect you.

47
00:02:22,771 --> 00:02:25,142
You're getting a ride
from random men...

48
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:26,672
which worries me.

49
00:02:26,672 --> 00:02:30,582
I'm too flabbergasted
to put this in words.

50
00:02:31,082 --> 00:02:32,112
Director Ko,

51
00:02:32,582 --> 00:02:35,251
Mr. Gong isn't some random guy.

52
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:37,051
He's my boyfriend.

53
00:02:37,051 --> 00:02:38,452
You see,

54
00:02:38,822 --> 00:02:41,692
we agreed to see each other.

55
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,192
What?

56
00:02:44,292 --> 00:02:45,392
Your boyfriend?

57
00:02:46,162 --> 00:02:47,192
I...

58
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:50,031
If I say I heard everything
and that I know she's lying,

59
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:52,871
it'll tick her off even more...

60
00:02:52,871 --> 00:02:54,531
which will make her call Mr. Gong...

61
00:02:54,531 --> 00:02:56,202
and agree to date him.

62
00:02:57,602 --> 00:02:59,642
Right. Let's hold back.

63
00:03:00,042 --> 00:03:02,582
What? Why are you smiling like that?

64
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:05,452
Does it seem like I'm lying?

65
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:07,112
It's the truth.

66
00:03:07,952 --> 00:03:11,852
Mr. Gong officially
asked me out today.

67
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,762
Unlike someone who only confuses me,

68
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:17,591
he is straightforward and manly.

69
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:19,431
How cool is that?

70
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:22,061
So I said yes.

71
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:24,132
Don't date him.

72
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,871
I'm against you seeing him.

73
00:03:26,871 --> 00:03:28,102
Gosh.

74
00:03:28,102 --> 00:03:30,371
Who are you to voice your opinion?

75
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:32,072
This wasn't put up for a vote.

76
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:34,811
I don't know why I'm talking...

77
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:38,311
about my personal life in detail
with some guy.

78
00:03:39,811 --> 00:03:41,251
I'll get going.

79
00:03:43,221 --> 00:03:44,852
Don't date Mr. Gong...

80
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:46,692
and date me instead.

81
00:03:46,692 --> 00:03:47,692
Director Ko.

82
00:03:48,692 --> 00:03:51,431
You said you weren't interested
when I said I liked you.

83
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:54,232
Does it seem like a waste
now that I'm dating someone else?

84
00:03:54,461 --> 00:03:57,862
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but the ship has already sailed.

85
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:01,672
Take these flowers though.
They're for you.

86
00:04:01,672 --> 00:04:03,042
Forget it.

87
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:05,971
I'm already dating someone...

88
00:04:05,971 --> 00:04:08,811
and can't accept flowers
from other men.

89
00:04:12,982 --> 00:04:13,982
Do Ra,

90
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:17,221
you said you didn't want
to remember your past.

91
00:04:18,121 --> 00:04:20,121
Dating Mr. Gong
is too dangerous for you.

92
00:04:21,192 --> 00:04:23,322
What if he also finds out
who you are?

93
00:04:24,692 --> 00:04:25,961
Listen to me, will you?

94
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:33,572
Goodness.

95
00:04:34,072 --> 00:04:36,302
Unbelievable.

96
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:48,322
What just happened today?

97
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:51,382
Did both men lose their minds
at the same time?

98
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:53,692
Why are they showing interest
in some hillbilly like me?

99
00:04:55,622 --> 00:04:56,661
I don't get it though.

100
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,062
Director Ko put up a steel wall
saying there was a reason...

101
00:05:00,062 --> 00:05:01,502
he couldn't like me.

102
00:05:02,031 --> 00:05:03,802
So what got into him?

103
00:05:06,132 --> 00:05:07,132
Is he free...

104
00:05:07,502 --> 00:05:09,872
to like me as he pleases now?

105
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:13,341
But you should've refused.

106
00:05:13,942 --> 00:05:18,287
How could you...

107
00:05:18,311 --> 00:05:20,441
hop into his car
just because he invited you to?

108
00:05:20,441 --> 00:05:22,681
You're both young and single.

109
00:05:22,981 --> 00:05:24,481
You should be careful.

110
00:05:24,481 --> 00:05:25,850
There's a wealthy family...

111
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,881
that wants our Pil Seung
to be their son-in-law.

112
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:32,321
Yes, of course.

113
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,090
Lying to Director Ko
about having a boyfriend...

114
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,931
was the right thing to do.

115
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,960
Ms. Kim and Ms. So
were clear about their requests.

116
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,871
I can't let his actions sway me.

117
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,441
Ms. Kim lives and breathes
for her only son.

118
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,071
I have no right to like him...

119
00:05:52,071 --> 00:05:54,580
when a wealthy family
wants him as a son-in-law.

120
00:05:56,011 --> 00:05:58,481
Besides, he changed his mind once...

121
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,481
and already broke my heart
after giving me hope.

122
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,850
He's a jerk.

123
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,460
They say a love
that is heartbreaking...

124
00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:11,090
isn't love at all.

125
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,311
Jin Ok made the final round.

126
00:06:35,321 --> 00:06:37,481
How did she know
she made the final round?

127
00:06:41,191 --> 00:06:42,191
Who knows?

128
00:06:42,191 --> 00:06:43,991
But I think she knows someone
at the broadcasting station.

129
00:06:45,431 --> 00:06:46,530
The broadcasting station?

130
00:06:55,171 --> 00:06:56,241
Ji Young,

131
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,071
go out with me.

132
00:06:58,571 --> 00:07:00,840
Right, then.
I'll give it some thought.

133
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,311
What do you mean
you'll think about it?

134
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:06,950
Yes?

135
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,720
Can I come in?

136
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,950
Hey, Auntie. Why are you still up?

137
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,390
Oh, right.

138
00:07:14,051 --> 00:07:15,590
I entered...

139
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,361
the screenplay contest
at your broadcasting station.

140
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,561
Is that so?

141
00:07:21,361 --> 00:07:22,460
Yes.

142
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,071
And it seems like
the finalists were chosen.

143
00:07:27,671 --> 00:07:30,840
Can you find out if I made the cut?

144
00:07:31,241 --> 00:07:32,770
How is that important?

145
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:33,840
Winning the contest should be
your goal.

146
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,640
Even if you make it
to the final round,

147
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,981
it won't mean anything
unless you win.

148
00:07:38,111 --> 00:07:39,111
Hey.

149
00:07:40,111 --> 00:07:42,150
How could you put it like that?

150
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,321
What I mean...

151
00:07:46,051 --> 00:07:48,861
is that you'll be notified
if you win the prize.

152
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:51,931
Just wait
until the notification is made.

153
00:07:51,931 --> 00:07:55,001
How can you be so mean?

154
00:07:56,061 --> 00:07:58,700
You always shoot down my ideas
whenever I come to you.

155
00:07:59,731 --> 00:08:01,801
So what if you're
a TV series director?

156
00:08:01,801 --> 00:08:03,571
So much for being a family.

157
00:08:07,871 --> 00:08:10,941
Auntie, how does being family
matter in this field?

158
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,210
You of all people know
that I can't pave the way for you.

159
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:16,681
If that is how things are done,

160
00:08:16,681 --> 00:08:18,390
children of screenwriters
will become screenwriters...

161
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,991
and actors' children
will all become actors.

162
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,361
Not even the President's child...

163
00:08:22,361 --> 00:08:24,660
can have a career in this field
without having the talent.

164
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,660
You know that.

165
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,631
Hey. As if we don't know that.

166
00:08:28,631 --> 00:08:31,770
But that doesn't mean
you can't give her a helping hand.

167
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:34,030
For over ten years, she has been...

168
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,501
working her butt off
to become a screenwriter.

169
00:08:35,501 --> 00:08:38,210
Don't you feel sorry for your aunt?

170
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,710
- Forget it, Mom.
- Hey.

171
00:08:40,871 --> 00:08:42,511
- Hey, why...
- Goodness.

172
00:08:42,511 --> 00:08:45,751
Mom. Why would you
take it out on Pil Seung?

173
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,221
Did he make Myung Dong
work her butt off?

174
00:08:48,221 --> 00:08:50,020
- What?
- It was her choice.

175
00:08:50,481 --> 00:08:52,991
Come with me, Mom. Let's go.

176
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,290
My goodness.

177
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:55,820
- Oh, dear.
- Go downstairs.

178
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,190
Is scriptwriting that big a deal?

179
00:08:57,491 --> 00:09:00,030
Why is she still trying
instead of getting married?

180
00:09:00,461 --> 00:09:02,900
Pil Seung,
don't you mind her at all.

181
00:09:03,701 --> 00:09:04,701
Goodness...

182
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,310
- Gosh, Mom.
- Let go.

183
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:14,780
Would he do this...

184
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,810
if he considered us family?

185
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,351
He acts like that
because he's a foundling.

186
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,920
Times like this are when that shows.

187
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,050
Mother. You were quiet for a while.
Why are you starting up again?

188
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,690
Okay, fine.

189
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,361
I'm so sorry for starting up again.
I deserve to die, don't I?

190
00:09:32,461 --> 00:09:34,131
- My goodness.
- Geez.

191
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,270
Why don't you say anything
when she says that word?

192
00:09:38,971 --> 00:09:41,770
I find it really hard
to have to live with her...

193
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,371
when she talks like that.

194
00:09:43,871 --> 00:09:45,570
Do whatever you want.

195
00:09:45,741 --> 00:09:47,770
You say that all the time yourself.

196
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,540
My goodness.

197
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,910
That's unbelievable.

198
00:09:53,081 --> 00:09:54,780
He's upset with me right now?

199
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,721
(Ko Pil Seung)

200
00:10:06,331 --> 00:10:08,060
Good luck, Auntie.

201
00:10:09,201 --> 00:10:10,701
I'm rooting for Ko Myung Dong.

202
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,471
Good morning, Ji Young.

203
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:52,640
Where are you going?

204
00:10:53,371 --> 00:10:54,371
Get in.

205
00:10:55,211 --> 00:10:56,741
Director Ko.

206
00:10:57,211 --> 00:10:59,011
I have a boyfriend now.

207
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:02,050
Why would someone's girlfriend
get in another man's car?

208
00:11:02,451 --> 00:11:04,820
I won't hitch rides
with other guys anymore.

209
00:11:04,851 --> 00:11:06,150
We're done carpooling.

210
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,351
Ji Young.

211
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,820
You already paid me
half the bus fare.

212
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,261
Let's at least go the full month.

213
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,861
Do you want to make me an embezzler?

214
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:18,570
You can consider that a tip.

215
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,601
Buy yourself some rice cakes.

216
00:11:21,701 --> 00:11:22,741
Bye.

217
00:11:24,001 --> 00:11:25,270
What? It's a tip?

218
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:35,621
What the...

219
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:38,351
Did you follow me to get on the bus?

220
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,420
What are you doing?

221
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,621
Why say I followed you?

222
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,261
Do you own this bus?

223
00:11:44,831 --> 00:11:47,261
Buses are public transport
anyone can take.

224
00:11:47,491 --> 00:11:49,060
I have a right to take a ride.

225
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,530
You were standing
next to your car just now.

226
00:11:51,701 --> 00:11:53,930
You got on this bus because I did.

227
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:55,670
I felt like...

228
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,140
taking the bus to work today.

229
00:11:58,371 --> 00:12:00,711
I usually take the bus, you know.

230
00:12:00,711 --> 00:12:02,140
So don't you mind...

231
00:12:02,381 --> 00:12:05,481
whether I take a bus or the subway.

232
00:12:08,011 --> 00:12:09,121
Goodness. Be careful.

233
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,800
Ji Young.

234
00:12:25,701 --> 00:12:26,930
You just hugged me, didn't you?

235
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,270
What stupid nonsense
are you on about?

236
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,640
I didn't hug you.

237
00:12:34,981 --> 00:12:37,341
I only helped you
in case you fell...

238
00:12:37,711 --> 00:12:38,780
and got hurt.

239
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:43,381
I thought you hugged me
because you liked me.

240
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:47,991
Goodness.
I shouldn't talk to you at all.

241
00:12:49,221 --> 00:12:52,131
You're the type
I should stay well away from.

242
00:12:58,001 --> 00:13:01,170
Ma Ri. I think you were
too generous with the presents.

243
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,540
I didn't do anything for you.

244
00:13:03,471 --> 00:13:06,241
You even offered
to treat me to a meal here.

245
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,780
I asked you to shop with me,
so of course...

246
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,711
I should pay and give you something.

247
00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:12,951
No, don't.

248
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,780
I don't know
how much a meal here costs,

249
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,680
but I'll pay for that.

250
00:13:17,981 --> 00:13:19,690
I know my manners.

251
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:21,861
Grandma. My dad told me...

252
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,731
not to be too frugal when treating
a friend to food or gifts.

253
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,601
- I see.
- You're my friend.

254
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,501
You listen when I talk,

255
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,131
and you like me a lot.

256
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:35,341
I like you so much, Grandma.

257
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,140
So don't worry
about the cost of today's date.

258
00:13:38,611 --> 00:13:40,611
We're BFs.

259
00:13:41,341 --> 00:13:42,711
"BF?"

260
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,341
Best friends?

261
00:13:45,011 --> 00:13:48,180
You say the sweetest things.

262
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:53,221
Ma Ri. I feel like
you're my friend too.

263
00:13:53,591 --> 00:13:57,261
True friends that go beyond age
and family background.

264
00:13:58,331 --> 00:14:00,361
There's nothing wrong
with this girl.

265
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,930
Pil Seung's such a fool.

266
00:14:03,461 --> 00:14:05,831
I think she's just adorable.

267
00:14:06,101 --> 00:14:08,640
I'd snatch her up if I were a guy.

268
00:14:08,871 --> 00:14:10,341
Ma Ri.

269
00:14:11,341 --> 00:14:13,070
We might be friends,

270
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:15,981
but I feel bad to always be
on the receiving end.

271
00:14:16,111 --> 00:14:19,751
As a friend,
I want to do something for you.

272
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,221
Ma Ri.

273
00:14:25,621 --> 00:14:27,650
Do you want to go on...

274
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,221
a private date with our Pil Seung?

275
00:14:32,361 --> 00:14:34,731
A private date with Pil Seung?

276
00:14:38,001 --> 00:14:39,070
Director Ko.

277
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:43,501
The revised script is out
and there's a problem.

278
00:14:43,971 --> 00:14:45,270
What problem?

279
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:47,040
The market clothes seller role...

280
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,111
that Ji Young
filled in for last time.

281
00:14:49,111 --> 00:14:50,111
What about it?

282
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,810
The writer thought
Ji Young did such a good job,

283
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,180
that she included
a few scenes for her.

284
00:14:55,851 --> 00:14:58,280
What? That's nonsense.

285
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,890
Why give Ji Young more scenes
when she's not even an actor?

286
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,491
I explained the actor
we'd hired got sick...

287
00:15:03,491 --> 00:15:06,060
and a crew member
stepped in at the last minute.

288
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:07,690
She said she didn't mind.

289
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,101
It's just a few lines
and she wants Ji Young.

290
00:15:10,831 --> 00:15:12,471
I think she loves her.

291
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,070
This is way too sudden.

292
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:21,371
What is Ms. Kim thinking?

293
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,511
Director Ko.
Ji Young did really well last time.

294
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,550
I checked the script
and her part isn't that long.

295
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,721
Here.

296
00:15:33,091 --> 00:15:36,020
We can't shoot today
if we ask for another revision.

297
00:15:38,361 --> 00:15:40,991
We can't afford another delay.

298
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,761
What's the matter with Ms. Kim?

299
00:15:43,761 --> 00:15:44,930
Why would she revise this?

300
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:56,680
Who are you?

301
00:15:59,581 --> 00:16:01,881
Hey. Aren't you the lady
from the market...

302
00:16:01,881 --> 00:16:03,581
who told us to take our pick?

303
00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:05,320
Yes.

304
00:16:06,621 --> 00:16:07,690
That's me.

305
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,020
Why are you here?

306
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:13,560
I saw the truth
and turned a blind eye...

307
00:16:13,731 --> 00:16:15,131
and it gave me insomnia.

308
00:16:16,231 --> 00:16:17,800
I'm here because I think...

309
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,170
I should tell you the truth
if I'm to sleep peacefully again.

310
00:16:21,371 --> 00:16:22,741
What truth?

311
00:16:23,501 --> 00:16:26,140
The woman you were with.
Don't let her deceive you.

312
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,711
She's a real dangerous woman.

313
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,881
Everything about her...

314
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,591
is a lie.

315
00:16:39,951 --> 00:16:41,020
What?

316
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,190
Who...

317
00:16:46,861 --> 00:16:47,861
are you?

318
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,300
Cut. Okay.

319
00:16:58,471 --> 00:17:00,341
- Your name is Kim Ji Young?
- Yes.

320
00:17:00,741 --> 00:17:03,711
When did you memorize all that
when we got the new script today?

321
00:17:04,241 --> 00:17:06,410
You're a true actor. You're amazing.

322
00:17:06,711 --> 00:17:09,650
Why would you flatter me so?

323
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:12,290
Stop it.
I'm getting all embarrassed.

324
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:15,391
I don't even remember how I did.

325
00:17:15,391 --> 00:17:16,991
You did really well.

326
00:17:16,991 --> 00:17:18,530
You're a genius
when it comes to acting.

327
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,731
Did you act in a previous lifetime?

328
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,701
You sucked me in and got all tense.

329
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,770
I think you have the talent
to get into acting.

330
00:17:28,231 --> 00:17:29,471
You should learn.

331
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,370
Should I?

332
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,171
You should. You did great.

333
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,971
You were incredible today, Ji Young.

334
00:17:35,011 --> 00:17:36,511
That was awesome. Well done.

335
00:17:36,711 --> 00:17:38,340
Thank you.

336
00:17:40,251 --> 00:17:41,280
Goodness.

337
00:17:42,481 --> 00:17:44,751
Ji Young. You did so well.

338
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,721
Director Ko. Wasn't she great?

339
00:17:49,161 --> 00:17:51,391
Well, that wasn't bad.

340
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:54,860
Thanks.

341
00:17:56,731 --> 00:17:59,770
"Well, that wasn't bad."
Was that a compliment or what?

342
00:18:00,001 --> 00:18:02,141
Couldn't he have made
a decent compliment?

343
00:18:04,241 --> 00:18:07,540
Gosh.
Why is my heart beating so fast?

344
00:18:12,451 --> 00:18:15,451
My heart is beating out of my chest.

345
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,620
Is acting this much fun?

346
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:22,421
A country bumpkin like me
came to Seoul and even tried acting.

347
00:18:22,761 --> 00:18:26,461
Kim Ji Young, you made it big.

348
00:18:28,701 --> 00:18:29,701
Ji Young.

349
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,870
Ji Young, I think
you are a gifted actress.

350
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,241
Did you learn acting?

351
00:18:35,241 --> 00:18:36,501
Learn acting?

352
00:18:39,011 --> 00:18:42,780
I've never done
anything like that before.

353
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,441
And you are still that good?

354
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,380
Unbelievable.

355
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:47,610
But you know what?

356
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:50,550
Maybe I was an actress
in my previous life.

357
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,921
With the lights above me,

358
00:18:51,921 --> 00:18:54,421
as soon
as the director gave his cue,

359
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,590
I felt as if the cells in my body
started popping like popcorn.

360
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,491
Then I started saying my lines
before I knew it.

361
00:19:00,491 --> 00:19:04,130
I was feeling so excited
and on cloud nine at the moment...

362
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,141
That's how I felt.

363
00:19:10,171 --> 00:19:14,011
Ji Young, why don't you start
studying acting?

364
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,080
What?

365
00:19:17,411 --> 00:19:19,310
That's ridiculous.

366
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:22,251
How on earth would
someone like me study acting?

367
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,050
Only special people can be actors.

368
00:19:25,721 --> 00:19:26,951
That's not true.

369
00:19:26,951 --> 00:19:29,020
It's not like there are people
who were born special.

370
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,790
They just become special
as they go along.

371
00:19:31,261 --> 00:19:33,761
You know, I've been working
only with top actresses...

372
00:19:33,761 --> 00:19:35,860
like Park Do Ra and Cho Bi Bi.

373
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,461
I can tell when someone has
what it takes to be a good actor...

374
00:19:37,461 --> 00:19:39,431
with my animal instinct.

375
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:41,630
You're really talented.

376
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:43,641
Are you serious?

377
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:46,340
Yes. You have to trust me.

378
00:19:46,741 --> 00:19:47,911
If you want,

379
00:19:47,911 --> 00:19:49,340
I can find you a good acting school.

380
00:19:49,941 --> 00:19:51,110
Acting school?

381
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,181
(King Acting School)

382
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,820
So this is it.

383
00:20:06,161 --> 00:20:09,530
Is it really okay for a girl like me
to study acting?

384
00:20:18,924 --> 00:20:19,924
Director.

385
00:20:20,565 --> 00:20:22,124
Hello. It's me, Baek Mi Ja.

386
00:20:22,124 --> 00:20:24,164
I'm Park Do Ra's mom.
You remember me, right?

387
00:20:26,535 --> 00:20:27,535
Director.

388
00:20:28,204 --> 00:20:31,035
I'm Baek Mi Ja, Park Do Ra's mom.
Do you remember me?

389
00:20:31,035 --> 00:20:32,634
Yes. Hello.

390
00:20:32,634 --> 00:20:34,045
It's been a long time.

391
00:20:34,045 --> 00:20:35,745
- Have you been doing well?
- Yes.

392
00:20:36,674 --> 00:20:39,884
I'm starting
a management agency again.

393
00:20:39,884 --> 00:20:41,545
Her name is Do Do.

394
00:20:41,545 --> 00:20:43,154
She's an actress at my agency.

395
00:20:43,154 --> 00:20:45,914
She's a diamond in the rough.

396
00:20:45,914 --> 00:20:48,654
Please take good care of her, sir.

397
00:20:48,654 --> 00:20:50,355
- Okay.
- All right.

398
00:20:54,025 --> 00:20:56,634
My goodness.
Mr. Jang and Director Hong.

399
00:20:57,495 --> 00:20:58,495
Baek...

400
00:21:02,204 --> 00:21:03,204
(Do Do, DOB October 23, 2001)

401
00:21:03,204 --> 00:21:06,105
After my Do Ra left me like that,

402
00:21:07,704 --> 00:21:09,245
I've been in a living death.

403
00:21:09,245 --> 00:21:10,414
To make a living,

404
00:21:11,414 --> 00:21:13,015
I've done all sorts of jobs.

405
00:21:13,015 --> 00:21:15,184
I was sick and tired
of the show business world,

406
00:21:15,184 --> 00:21:17,884
so I didn't want
to stick my fingers back in.

407
00:21:18,785 --> 00:21:20,855
But this is all I'm good at.

408
00:21:21,825 --> 00:21:25,525
So I had no choice but to come back.

409
00:21:32,734 --> 00:21:35,134
Thank you, Mr. Jang.

410
00:21:39,805 --> 00:21:40,974
- Mr. Jang.
- Yes.

411
00:21:41,904 --> 00:21:43,545
- Director Hong.
- Yes.

412
00:21:43,545 --> 00:21:45,644
You know, once I set my mind to it,

413
00:21:45,644 --> 00:21:47,484
I can excel at my job in this field.

414
00:21:48,045 --> 00:21:51,015
I can recognize
diamonds in the rough.

415
00:21:51,154 --> 00:21:52,914
And I can turn them
into beautiful gems...

416
00:21:52,914 --> 00:21:54,954
and make them top stars.

417
00:21:54,954 --> 00:21:58,694
That's how I made my Do Ra a star.

418
00:22:00,265 --> 00:22:01,595
- Mr. Jang.
- Yes.

419
00:22:01,765 --> 00:22:03,434
- Director Hong.
- Yes.

420
00:22:03,795 --> 00:22:06,164
Please help me this once.

421
00:22:06,164 --> 00:22:09,134
For my Do Ra's sake.

422
00:22:13,704 --> 00:22:15,045
Oh, dear.

423
00:22:17,745 --> 00:22:19,515
Hey, where's Pil Seung?

424
00:22:19,884 --> 00:22:22,745
He went out to the site
with the camera director.

425
00:22:22,984 --> 00:22:23,984
Really?

426
00:22:24,684 --> 00:22:26,015
Sook Ja.

427
00:22:26,015 --> 00:22:28,855
Don't you need a female extra,
by any chance?

428
00:22:29,085 --> 00:22:30,795
- A female extra?
- Yes.

429
00:22:31,194 --> 00:22:34,325
This is a new actress
Park Do Ra's mom is training.

430
00:22:34,325 --> 00:22:36,335
Do you have a minor role
that she can play?

431
00:22:36,995 --> 00:22:38,664
Actually, we were...

432
00:22:38,664 --> 00:22:41,404
looking for an actress in her 20s
for about 3 scenes.

433
00:22:42,535 --> 00:22:43,775
And I like her face.

434
00:22:43,775 --> 00:22:45,974
You do? I'm glad to hear that.

435
00:22:45,974 --> 00:22:47,144
Let her play the role.

436
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:49,505
Okay. I'll talk to Director Ko.

437
00:22:49,974 --> 00:22:51,714
Fine. Tell him...

438
00:22:51,714 --> 00:22:53,944
that it's Mr. Jang's favor.

439
00:22:53,944 --> 00:22:55,684
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

440
00:22:55,684 --> 00:22:57,384
- All right. See you.
- Yes.

441
00:23:13,305 --> 00:23:14,605
Yes, Director Hong.

442
00:23:16,134 --> 00:23:17,174
Are you serious?

443
00:23:17,904 --> 00:23:20,105
Are you sure
Do Do will be on the project?

444
00:23:20,105 --> 00:23:21,105
Yes.

445
00:23:21,105 --> 00:23:25,015
It's a minor role that appears
in three scenes. Is that all right?

446
00:23:25,115 --> 00:23:27,184
Of course, it is.

447
00:23:27,684 --> 00:23:29,755
I owe you big time.

448
00:23:29,755 --> 00:23:32,555
I just did as I was told.

449
00:23:32,855 --> 00:23:35,484
Mr. Jang took care of it.

450
00:23:35,484 --> 00:23:38,654
Really? I don't know
how I can ever repay your kindness.

451
00:23:38,654 --> 00:23:40,924
By the way, Director Hong,
what about the script?

452
00:23:40,924 --> 00:23:42,865
She can't practice without a script.

453
00:23:42,865 --> 00:23:44,565
When can we get one?

454
00:23:44,565 --> 00:23:47,434
We need the main director
to approve it first.

455
00:23:47,434 --> 00:23:48,464
You will hear from them soon.

456
00:23:48,664 --> 00:23:50,934
Okay. Thank you so much.

457
00:23:50,934 --> 00:23:52,305
Yes. I'll be waiting.

458
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,644
Yes. Thank you.

459
00:23:54,075 --> 00:23:56,714
My goodness. I can't believe this.

460
00:23:57,874 --> 00:23:59,144
This is so nice.

461
00:24:04,355 --> 00:24:05,684
It's me, Do Do.

462
00:24:06,785 --> 00:24:08,724
You've been cast.

463
00:24:09,525 --> 00:24:10,724
Yes.

464
00:24:10,724 --> 00:24:12,424
So don't do anything silly.

465
00:24:12,424 --> 00:24:14,894
Just make sure to stick
to the diet I gave you and exercise.

466
00:24:14,894 --> 00:24:16,595
Don't go out, okay?

467
00:24:16,865 --> 00:24:20,634
If I catch you messing around,
you'll be in big trouble. Okay?

468
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:24,305
Ji Young, I'll see you there.

469
00:24:25,075 --> 00:24:26,075
Bye.

470
00:24:27,874 --> 00:24:29,204
Okay.

471
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:32,674
Do I look all right today?

472
00:24:34,444 --> 00:24:35,444
(Tae Hee)

473
00:24:43,894 --> 00:24:46,595
It's me, Tae Hee. Yes.

474
00:24:46,894 --> 00:24:48,464
I was going to give you a call.

475
00:24:48,924 --> 00:24:50,164
I guess I'm a little late.

476
00:24:50,795 --> 00:24:52,095
It doesn't matter who calls first.

477
00:24:52,095 --> 00:24:53,305
I know you're busy.

478
00:24:53,365 --> 00:24:55,565
A foreign investor came to visit
a few days ago,

479
00:24:56,335 --> 00:24:58,204
so I've been really busy.

480
00:24:58,605 --> 00:24:59,874
I was all over the place.

481
00:25:00,775 --> 00:25:01,775
Really?

482
00:25:02,345 --> 00:25:04,474
I was hoping
we could have dinner together.

483
00:25:04,474 --> 00:25:05,515
And watch a movie.

484
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:07,414
I see.

485
00:25:09,045 --> 00:25:10,785
I'm so sorry,

486
00:25:10,785 --> 00:25:13,724
but I have dinner plans
with the investor tonight.

487
00:25:15,355 --> 00:25:16,495
I'm sorry, Tae Hee.

488
00:25:16,855 --> 00:25:19,525
Don't be. I understand
your work comes first.

489
00:25:21,065 --> 00:25:22,865
Tae Hee, what about tomorrow?

490
00:25:24,765 --> 00:25:25,964
I'll see you tomorrow then.

491
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:27,734
Bye.

492
00:25:36,404 --> 00:25:39,045
Hello, ma'am. I'm Tae Hee.

493
00:25:39,045 --> 00:25:41,245
Hey. Welcome, Tae Hee.

494
00:25:41,684 --> 00:25:42,714
This is for you.

495
00:25:43,454 --> 00:25:44,454
It's puer tea.

496
00:25:44,984 --> 00:25:48,055
Jin Dan told me
that you liked puer tea.

497
00:25:49,085 --> 00:25:50,154
This is rare.

498
00:25:50,154 --> 00:25:53,025
Really? I love puer tea.

499
00:25:53,394 --> 00:25:54,424
Thanks.

500
00:26:02,964 --> 00:26:05,904
I've always wanted to meet you.

501
00:26:05,904 --> 00:26:06,904
You're beautiful.

502
00:26:06,904 --> 00:26:09,275
Come on. Not anymore.

503
00:26:09,845 --> 00:26:12,845
I was quite good-looking
when I was younger.

504
00:26:13,115 --> 00:26:14,785
You still look gorgeous.

505
00:26:14,785 --> 00:26:16,585
I guess he's handsome
because he takes after you.

506
00:26:16,585 --> 00:26:18,585
My gosh. Do you really think so?

507
00:26:18,585 --> 00:26:19,615
Of course.

508
00:26:20,325 --> 00:26:22,624
Ma'am, when I date a man,
I do care about his looks.

509
00:26:22,785 --> 00:26:23,995
I'm not easily satisfied.

510
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:29,295
Aren't you sweet, Tae Hee?

511
00:26:30,095 --> 00:26:32,835
By the way,
why do you have to wait a year...

512
00:26:32,835 --> 00:26:35,335
when you two are so into each other?

513
00:26:35,335 --> 00:26:36,634
That's exactly what I thought.

514
00:26:37,374 --> 00:26:39,404
But there are
a lot of divorces that happen,

515
00:26:39,404 --> 00:26:40,605
so my parents are worried.

516
00:26:41,505 --> 00:26:44,315
They don't want me to make
a decision that I might regret.

517
00:26:44,845 --> 00:26:47,115
I guess they have a point.

518
00:26:48,085 --> 00:26:51,515
But I think you guys are
old enough to know better.

519
00:26:52,115 --> 00:26:53,884
I'll talk about it with Jin Dan.

520
00:26:54,424 --> 00:26:56,255
Okay. Have some tea.

521
00:27:04,934 --> 00:27:08,134
What? Isn't that Jin Dan?

522
00:27:11,734 --> 00:27:13,404
Who's that girl next to him?

523
00:27:22,345 --> 00:27:25,285
- The person you have reached is...
- Gosh, he rejected my call.

524
00:27:25,285 --> 00:27:26,355
That brat.

525
00:27:27,124 --> 00:27:28,924
He told Tae Hee
that he had a meeting to attend,

526
00:27:28,924 --> 00:27:30,694
but he was seeing someone else.

527
00:27:31,454 --> 00:27:32,894
That's just wrong.

528
00:27:41,734 --> 00:27:44,305
How can a unit
be this spacious and nice?

529
00:27:44,835 --> 00:27:47,105
Anyway, why are we here?

530
00:27:47,944 --> 00:27:49,944
If you like the place, move in.

531
00:27:51,845 --> 00:27:52,845
Me?

532
00:27:54,515 --> 00:27:55,644
Goodness.

533
00:27:56,245 --> 00:27:59,454
You and your silly jokes.

534
00:28:01,424 --> 00:28:02,855
I wasn't joking.

535
00:28:02,954 --> 00:28:05,095
I told you before
that I'm fond of you.

536
00:28:05,654 --> 00:28:07,295
I don't want the woman I like...

537
00:28:07,295 --> 00:28:09,525
to live in some dingy unit.

538
00:28:10,434 --> 00:28:12,434
But I don't have the money
to live in a place this nice.

539
00:28:13,535 --> 00:28:16,404
The unit is in my name,
so move in at any time you want.

540
00:28:18,305 --> 00:28:21,275
How could I live
in a unit this nice for free?

541
00:28:21,404 --> 00:28:22,745
What gives me the right?

542
00:28:23,144 --> 00:28:24,275
That's insane.

543
00:28:24,414 --> 00:28:25,444
It isn't.

544
00:28:25,444 --> 00:28:28,315
Being my girlfriend
will give you the right.

545
00:28:29,384 --> 00:28:30,384
Sorry?

546
00:28:30,414 --> 00:28:33,624
What I mean is that
being my girlfriend...

547
00:28:34,085 --> 00:28:35,785
will have its perks.

548
00:28:36,855 --> 00:28:39,894
That's something to consider
while you make up your mind.

549
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:42,464
- Perks?
- Yes.

550
00:28:43,124 --> 00:28:45,835
Goodness me. Forget it.

551
00:28:46,365 --> 00:28:48,305
I'm not shameless enough...

552
00:28:48,305 --> 00:28:50,874
to live in such a big unit
all by myself.

553
00:28:51,835 --> 00:28:54,474
Besides, I like
where I'm currently staying.

554
00:28:54,644 --> 00:28:57,374
It's small, cozy,
and puts me to sleep easily.

555
00:28:58,815 --> 00:29:02,085
The unit is nice, I give you that.

556
00:29:03,315 --> 00:29:04,654
You're Do Ra's substitute.

557
00:29:06,255 --> 00:29:08,184
You'll keep me company in her stead.

558
00:29:08,724 --> 00:29:11,255
We should get going, then.

559
00:29:16,065 --> 00:29:18,295
Why is that nobody
playing hard to get, though?

560
00:29:19,194 --> 00:29:21,805
Of course.
Hunting is all about the chase.

561
00:29:24,275 --> 00:29:26,174
Sure. We'll film
the vacation home scene...

562
00:29:26,174 --> 00:29:27,644
at the place we scouted today.

563
00:29:28,374 --> 00:29:29,674
Right. Great work.

564
00:29:33,015 --> 00:29:34,214
Did Ji Young head home?

565
00:29:37,755 --> 00:29:39,085
Don't tell me...

566
00:29:39,984 --> 00:29:42,055
she went to meet Mr. Gong
since work ended early.

567
00:29:48,295 --> 00:29:49,464
Hey, Grandma. It's me.

568
00:29:51,095 --> 00:29:53,035
Yes, I guess I'm done at work today.

569
00:29:55,934 --> 00:29:56,934
What?

570
00:29:57,704 --> 00:29:59,234
You're near
the broadcasting station?

571
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:01,174
Pil Seung.

572
00:30:02,305 --> 00:30:03,575
Ma Ri, just a second.

573
00:30:09,745 --> 00:30:10,755
Come here.

574
00:30:14,884 --> 00:30:18,255
Grandma, what's going on?
Why are you with Ma Ri?

575
00:30:19,325 --> 00:30:20,424
You see,

576
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:23,224
I felt bad for Ma Ri...

577
00:30:23,634 --> 00:30:25,535
that I arranged this today.

578
00:30:26,394 --> 00:30:27,805
What do you mean by that?

579
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:32,374
What else could I do
when she likes you so much?

580
00:30:32,835 --> 00:30:34,275
She calls you a prince...

581
00:30:34,275 --> 00:30:36,075
and says her heart pounds
when she thinks about you.

582
00:30:36,605 --> 00:30:38,714
I felt bad for her,
so I brought her here.

583
00:30:40,484 --> 00:30:42,984
It's only one meal.

584
00:30:43,045 --> 00:30:45,785
Make her wish come true
just this once, Pil Seung.

585
00:30:46,684 --> 00:30:47,755
Grandma,

586
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:50,924
that doesn't mean
you can spring this on me.

587
00:30:51,795 --> 00:30:53,724
I feel bad for her.

588
00:30:54,365 --> 00:30:57,565
Ma Ri isn't like
other girls her age.

589
00:30:57,694 --> 00:30:58,894
She's sick.

590
00:30:59,535 --> 00:31:01,664
But she comes by our house
all the time...

591
00:31:01,664 --> 00:31:04,005
looking for you,
and she can't take her eyes off you.

592
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:06,874
Besides, she's the daughter...

593
00:31:06,874 --> 00:31:09,545
of your mom's best friend.

594
00:31:10,245 --> 00:31:11,414
Pil Seung,

595
00:31:11,815 --> 00:31:15,714
you'll be blessed one day
for being nice to her.

596
00:31:15,984 --> 00:31:17,214
Unbelievable.

597
00:31:19,384 --> 00:31:22,555
I didn't know your grandma
had other plans today.

598
00:31:22,555 --> 00:31:23,694
Please don't get the wrong idea.

599
00:31:23,755 --> 00:31:26,964
I only came to see her
because she suggested this meal.

600
00:31:28,194 --> 00:31:29,795
I hope you don't get the wrong idea.

601
00:31:31,035 --> 00:31:32,565
I won't, so dig in.

602
00:31:33,904 --> 00:31:34,904
Sure.

603
00:31:36,335 --> 00:31:39,974
Mr. Ko,
I want to get to know you better.

604
00:31:40,404 --> 00:31:43,775
Our moms are friends,
so let's be friends too.

605
00:31:45,714 --> 00:31:49,085
I don't have many friends...

606
00:31:49,745 --> 00:31:52,384
and would love to have you...

607
00:31:52,384 --> 00:31:54,085
as a friend.

608
00:31:56,894 --> 00:31:59,224
Sure. I'm fond of Ms. Jang,

609
00:31:59,654 --> 00:32:01,124
and she's friends with my mom,

610
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:03,194
so we should also get along.

611
00:32:03,694 --> 00:32:07,204
To celebrate this day,
I'll treat you to today's meal.

612
00:32:07,404 --> 00:32:08,634
That's ridiculous.

613
00:32:08,634 --> 00:32:09,865
I should treat you instead
since I'm older.

614
00:32:10,234 --> 00:32:11,275
Really, Pil Seung?

615
00:32:13,505 --> 00:32:15,075
When you call him,

616
00:32:15,275 --> 00:32:18,515
don't call him by his name
which makes you sound too young.

617
00:32:19,474 --> 00:32:22,345
Just go with Mr. Ko,

618
00:32:22,345 --> 00:32:24,384
and he'll see you more
as a romantic interest.

619
00:32:26,484 --> 00:32:27,984
Sure, think of me as a big brother.

620
00:32:28,184 --> 00:32:29,355
Our moms are friends, right?

621
00:32:29,855 --> 00:32:31,255
It's fine, Mr. Ko.

622
00:32:31,624 --> 00:32:34,595
I'd rather
just address you like that.

623
00:32:38,365 --> 00:32:39,365
Is that so?

624
00:32:39,934 --> 00:32:42,035
Do what makes you feel comfortable.

625
00:32:42,505 --> 00:32:43,805
I don't mind it either way.

626
00:32:44,874 --> 00:32:46,974
Sure. Thanks, Mr. Ko.

627
00:33:01,785 --> 00:33:04,855
So you spent time with her
and now you're driving her home?

628
00:33:06,355 --> 00:33:07,464
I see.

629
00:33:08,164 --> 00:33:09,894
Her driver said...

630
00:33:09,894 --> 00:33:12,095
she was out with a friend
which is what I believed.

631
00:33:12,595 --> 00:33:13,865
Isn't Mr. Park around?

632
00:33:15,265 --> 00:33:16,734
She sent him home.

633
00:33:17,134 --> 00:33:18,204
Anyway, I'm almost there.

634
00:33:24,015 --> 00:33:25,045
I see.

635
00:33:25,775 --> 00:33:27,585
I appreciate you calling me.

636
00:33:28,444 --> 00:33:29,444
Sure.

637
00:33:31,414 --> 00:33:33,315
What on earth?

638
00:33:38,795 --> 00:33:41,365
Do Jun, where are you?

639
00:33:41,724 --> 00:33:43,734
I'm waiting for Ma Ri
at the restaurant parking lot.

640
00:33:45,535 --> 00:33:48,704
What? Ma Ri's heading home
in someone else's car?

641
00:33:48,964 --> 00:33:51,904
Yes, so don't wait for her
and head home.

642
00:33:56,704 --> 00:33:58,745
How did she get in touch
with Pil Seung?

643
00:34:00,275 --> 00:34:02,414
She even lied to Do Jun
about meeting a friend.

644
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:05,085
Darn.

645
00:34:06,184 --> 00:34:08,154
What am I going to do about Ma Ri?

646
00:34:24,935 --> 00:34:25,935
Hi.

647
00:34:26,205 --> 00:34:27,475
Hey, Pil Seung.

648
00:34:28,975 --> 00:34:30,674
I hope Ma Ri didn't put you out.

649
00:34:30,674 --> 00:34:32,044
I'm sorry about this.

650
00:34:32,044 --> 00:34:33,115
It's all right.

651
00:34:33,115 --> 00:34:35,345
We grabbed a bite to eat
and had a great time.

652
00:34:35,415 --> 00:34:38,285
Mom, I had so much fun
with Mr. Ko today.

653
00:34:38,354 --> 00:34:39,814
We went to an arcade together...

654
00:34:39,814 --> 00:34:42,055
and had ice cream together
on the street.

655
00:34:44,794 --> 00:34:45,794
I see.

656
00:34:46,154 --> 00:34:48,365
I'll get going, then.
Have a good night.

657
00:34:48,995 --> 00:34:50,694
Sure. Drive home safely.

658
00:34:50,935 --> 00:34:51,995
Thanks.

659
00:34:53,064 --> 00:34:55,134
Mr. Ko, until next time!

660
00:34:55,765 --> 00:34:57,205
Sure. Bye, Ms. Ma Ri.

661
00:35:05,214 --> 00:35:06,345
Hold on.

662
00:35:09,015 --> 00:35:10,714
What on earth is this?

663
00:35:10,714 --> 00:35:11,984
You didn't even tell me...

664
00:35:12,884 --> 00:35:13,984
and made him wait for you.

665
00:35:13,984 --> 00:35:15,524
lied to Do Jun
about meeting a friend,

666
00:35:15,955 --> 00:35:19,725
I wanted to get a ride home
from Mr. Ko, that's all.

667
00:35:19,995 --> 00:35:21,024
What?

668
00:35:22,424 --> 00:35:24,765
And why do you keep calling him that
when he's like a brother to you?

669
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:26,734
What's wrong with that?

670
00:35:26,865 --> 00:35:29,964
I didn't want him
to see me as a young girl,

671
00:35:29,964 --> 00:35:31,774
so I'll be addressing him
by his last name.

672
00:35:31,904 --> 00:35:34,044
Only that way will he see me
for the grown woman I am.

673
00:35:35,404 --> 00:35:36,504
Is that why?

674
00:35:36,745 --> 00:35:39,044
He treated me
like a young lady today...

675
00:35:39,044 --> 00:35:40,274
and not like a baby sister.

676
00:35:41,185 --> 00:35:42,214
Ma Ri, please.

677
00:35:43,245 --> 00:35:46,354
You promised me and your dad
that you'd move on from him.

678
00:35:46,515 --> 00:35:48,754
Mom, according
to Pil Seung's grandma,

679
00:35:48,754 --> 00:35:50,455
he isn't seeing anyone.

680
00:35:50,725 --> 00:35:52,455
Why should I move on
when he's not taken?

681
00:35:52,595 --> 00:35:53,625
Why should I give up?

682
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:55,365
I'll keep making a move...

683
00:35:55,365 --> 00:35:57,134
- until it works.
- What?

684
00:35:57,665 --> 00:35:58,694
Ma Ri.

685
00:35:59,995 --> 00:36:01,234
Why are you both outside?

686
00:36:02,134 --> 00:36:03,165
Dad.

687
00:36:03,504 --> 00:36:06,935
I had a date with Mr. Ko today.
It was just the two of us.

688
00:36:06,935 --> 00:36:08,904
You have no idea how much fun I had.

689
00:36:09,575 --> 00:36:12,314
What? What do you mean by that?

690
00:36:15,283 --> 00:36:17,414
Are they still on their date?

691
00:36:17,783 --> 00:36:19,854
How nice would it be
for them to go on a few dates...

692
00:36:19,854 --> 00:36:21,524
and end up together?

693
00:36:21,996 --> 00:36:25,096
Hold on.
Where are the Korean melons?

694
00:36:25,496 --> 00:36:27,636
- Darn.
- Mother.

695
00:36:28,065 --> 00:36:31,306
Mother, I heard you set Ma Ri up
with Pil Seung.

696
00:36:31,406 --> 00:36:34,136
Yes, that I did. What about it?

697
00:36:34,675 --> 00:36:36,806
Mother, what is the matter with you?

698
00:36:36,806 --> 00:36:39,416
Why are you causing trouble
for everyone?

699
00:36:39,416 --> 00:36:40,445
What?

700
00:36:40,445 --> 00:36:42,386
Soo Yeon was barely able
to get Ma Ri to move on,

701
00:36:42,386 --> 00:36:44,016
but she called just now...

702
00:36:44,016 --> 00:36:46,355
saying how upset she was
to see Ma Ri hopeful again.

703
00:36:46,516 --> 00:36:50,386
Ma Ri has the biggest crush
on Pil Seung.

704
00:36:50,886 --> 00:36:52,925
We even grant wishes for the dead,

705
00:36:52,925 --> 00:36:56,166
so how was it wrong
to set them up on a dinner date?

706
00:36:56,166 --> 00:36:59,065
Ma Ri isn't like the girls her age.

707
00:36:59,065 --> 00:37:00,065
And it's a problem...

708
00:37:00,065 --> 00:37:02,666
because she likes him
when he doesn't like her back.

709
00:37:02,666 --> 00:37:04,706
Exactly! Your friend
should be grateful...

710
00:37:04,706 --> 00:37:07,775
since I set up a dinner date that
would've never happened otherwise.

711
00:37:07,775 --> 00:37:10,206
What's your friend's problem?

712
00:37:10,206 --> 00:37:11,505
And she calls herself the mother?

713
00:37:11,505 --> 00:37:13,916
How could she not be considerate
of her daughter's feelings?

714
00:37:13,916 --> 00:37:15,445
So heartless!

715
00:37:16,145 --> 00:37:17,445
I'm home.

716
00:37:17,886 --> 00:37:18,956
Gosh, Pil Seung.

717
00:37:19,386 --> 00:37:22,386
I heard you met with Ma Ri today.

718
00:37:22,826 --> 00:37:24,156
I bet it was tough.

719
00:37:24,925 --> 00:37:26,425
Hardly. It was fine.

720
00:37:26,425 --> 00:37:28,156
We had dinner together
and talked a bit.

721
00:37:28,826 --> 00:37:30,726
I owe Ms. Jang that much.

722
00:37:31,226 --> 00:37:32,295
I'll head upstairs, then.

723
00:37:32,295 --> 00:37:33,735
Sure, go ahead.

724
00:37:35,105 --> 00:37:37,065
Hey.

725
00:37:37,835 --> 00:37:40,636
Pil Seung just said he was fine.

726
00:37:41,576 --> 00:37:43,105
I'm home.

727
00:37:45,416 --> 00:37:47,246
What's with Mom?

728
00:37:47,645 --> 00:37:50,616
Did you two argue?

729
00:37:51,545 --> 00:37:52,755
You...

730
00:37:53,386 --> 00:37:55,326
Were you aware of it too?

731
00:37:55,485 --> 00:37:57,326
Were you and your mother
in this together again?

732
00:37:57,686 --> 00:38:00,556
What are you accusing me of
out of the blue? Come on.

733
00:38:00,556 --> 00:38:01,996
Hey!

734
00:38:02,326 --> 00:38:04,166
Hyun Chul doesn't know anything.

735
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:05,465
What do you mean we colluded?

736
00:38:05,735 --> 00:38:07,996
Also, when your husband
comes home at night,

737
00:38:07,996 --> 00:38:09,735
you should ask how his day was...

738
00:38:09,735 --> 00:38:11,166
and if he had dinner!

739
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:15,206
You have no right to say anything...

740
00:38:15,206 --> 00:38:17,145
even if Hyun Chul
ends up cheating on you.

741
00:38:17,145 --> 00:38:18,375
Do you get it?

742
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:19,445
Why you...

743
00:38:22,916 --> 00:38:25,416
My gosh.

744
00:38:25,416 --> 00:38:26,485
What is it?

745
00:38:27,386 --> 00:38:30,085
Is someone having an affair?

746
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:31,656
Seriously?

747
00:38:43,005 --> 00:38:44,005
Do Jun!

748
00:38:44,565 --> 00:38:45,675
Ma Ri.

749
00:38:46,835 --> 00:38:47,875
What's up?

750
00:38:49,246 --> 00:38:51,846
Sorry. I wanted to apologize
for today.

751
00:38:53,576 --> 00:38:55,145
I'm glad nothing happened to you.

752
00:38:58,516 --> 00:38:59,516
Still,

753
00:39:00,116 --> 00:39:02,686
I'm your driver
and also your bodyguard.

754
00:39:04,386 --> 00:39:05,925
If I can't be there to protect you,

755
00:39:05,925 --> 00:39:07,456
there's no point in me staying here.

756
00:39:08,056 --> 00:39:09,425
I said I was sorry.

757
00:39:09,826 --> 00:39:11,266
I won't pull
something like this again.

758
00:39:12,096 --> 00:39:13,695
Will you forgive me?

759
00:39:14,695 --> 00:39:15,735
Fine.

760
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:19,476
If I had told you
to go home without me,

761
00:39:19,476 --> 00:39:22,005
you would've insisted on waiting...

762
00:39:22,005 --> 00:39:24,306
and would've told my mom.

763
00:39:24,505 --> 00:39:27,616
That would've ruined my plans
which left me with no other choice.

764
00:39:28,545 --> 00:39:30,786
So, did everything go as planned?

765
00:39:30,786 --> 00:39:32,956
Yes, Pil Seung and me...

766
00:39:33,386 --> 00:39:35,425
I mean, this day
will go down in history...

767
00:39:35,425 --> 00:39:38,525
as the day Mr. Ko and I
had our first date.

768
00:39:38,525 --> 00:39:40,855
The excitement alone
will keep me up tonight.

769
00:39:42,465 --> 00:39:43,866
I'm glad to see you're happy.

770
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:49,166
Gosh.

771
00:39:49,965 --> 00:39:51,005
No way.

772
00:39:53,175 --> 00:39:55,605
Hey, what's going on?

773
00:39:57,105 --> 00:39:59,875
Can I touch your biceps?

774
00:40:00,516 --> 00:40:01,645
No.

775
00:40:01,645 --> 00:40:04,145
Just this once. Come on.

776
00:40:06,386 --> 00:40:07,386
Fine.

777
00:40:08,186 --> 00:40:09,286
Just this once.

778
00:40:09,755 --> 00:40:10,755
Sure.

779
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:13,625
No way!

780
00:40:15,025 --> 00:40:17,025
Look how firm it is.

781
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:19,195
Do Jun, that's so cool.

782
00:40:19,795 --> 00:40:20,936
It's really nothing.

783
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:40,116
Ma Ri must truly be infatuated
with Pil Seung.

784
00:40:40,786 --> 00:40:43,625
A meal with him
has her on cloud nine.

785
00:40:46,195 --> 00:40:47,295
Honey,

786
00:40:48,596 --> 00:40:49,965
this won't do.

787
00:40:50,525 --> 00:40:52,335
I'll take Ma Ri...

788
00:40:52,965 --> 00:40:54,735
and live in the US for 1 or 2 years.

789
00:40:55,706 --> 00:40:59,505
She'll study art design
while she's there.

790
00:40:59,505 --> 00:41:00,835
What do you think?

791
00:41:01,675 --> 00:41:03,375
I can't agree to that.

792
00:41:04,605 --> 00:41:06,746
She had a hard time
adjusting in the US.

793
00:41:06,746 --> 00:41:08,516
That's why she had to come back.

794
00:41:09,916 --> 00:41:12,485
It wasn't easy for her
to make new friends there.

795
00:41:13,255 --> 00:41:16,186
It wasn't easy for me
to be alone here either.

796
00:41:17,386 --> 00:41:18,596
What else can we do?

797
00:41:18,596 --> 00:41:21,125
How can we get her
to lose interest in Pil Seung?

798
00:41:21,496 --> 00:41:22,525
Honey.

799
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:25,295
Don't worry too much.

800
00:41:25,295 --> 00:41:27,366
We'll see how things go.

801
00:41:28,936 --> 00:41:32,306
I'm grateful
for what Pil Seung did today.

802
00:41:33,005 --> 00:41:35,275
For having a good time with Ma Ri.

803
00:41:36,545 --> 00:41:39,545
Pil Seung is a fine young man.

804
00:41:40,815 --> 00:41:42,916
The two could end up together.

805
00:41:43,386 --> 00:41:45,516
But even if it doesn't work out,

806
00:41:46,286 --> 00:41:47,956
this process...

807
00:41:48,855 --> 00:41:51,056
could help Ma Ri mature.

808
00:41:52,156 --> 00:41:53,326
Besides,

809
00:41:54,295 --> 00:41:56,425
Ma Ri won't agree to go to the US.

810
00:42:00,536 --> 00:42:01,596
I'll wash up.

811
00:42:10,145 --> 00:42:11,175
Sure.

812
00:42:12,416 --> 00:42:15,346
It's not like Pil Seung
is interested in Ma Ri.

813
00:42:17,246 --> 00:42:20,255
After a while,
this will only exhaust her.

814
00:42:24,226 --> 00:42:27,125
Ji Young, I treated you
to dinner today,

815
00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:28,596
so we still have
two dinner dates left.

816
00:42:29,465 --> 00:42:31,625
I should've treated you
to the meal today.

817
00:42:31,625 --> 00:42:34,266
I can't believe
you got the bill before me.

818
00:42:34,266 --> 00:42:36,636
You won't make up your mind
about being my girlfriend,

819
00:42:36,636 --> 00:42:38,505
so I'm desperately trying
to buy some time.

820
00:42:39,175 --> 00:42:42,045
Anyway, let me know
by the end of our last dinner date.

821
00:42:42,875 --> 00:42:44,505
Although I'd like it more
if you got back to me before that.

822
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,875
Sure thing. Get home safely, then.

823
00:43:01,295 --> 00:43:03,125
- Bye.
- Bye.

824
00:43:11,436 --> 00:43:12,476
Gosh.

825
00:43:19,976 --> 00:43:21,715
I see he isn't your boyfriend yet.

826
00:43:24,215 --> 00:43:26,215
So why did you lie to me?

827
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:31,656
You should know that I have
already made up my mind.

828
00:43:31,656 --> 00:43:34,625
I'm only taking my time
because I want to be sure.

829
00:43:35,366 --> 00:43:36,496
What was that again?

830
00:43:36,826 --> 00:43:39,536
That's right.
I'm playing hard to get.

831
00:43:39,866 --> 00:43:42,965
Either way, he isn't
officially your boyfriend yet.

832
00:43:44,706 --> 00:43:47,275
Right, we're just flirting.

833
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:48,375
How's that for an answer?

834
00:43:50,875 --> 00:43:54,246
Anyway, why are you interested
in what goes on in my life?

835
00:43:54,246 --> 00:43:55,386
You're being a nuisance.

836
00:43:56,246 --> 00:43:58,085
I didn't think you'd be this way,

837
00:43:58,416 --> 00:44:00,516
but you can be quite unfair.

838
00:44:00,815 --> 00:44:01,815
Me?

839
00:44:02,355 --> 00:44:04,855
What do you mean? I'm not like that.

840
00:44:04,855 --> 00:44:06,695
Then why do you have meals
with Mr. Gong...

841
00:44:07,255 --> 00:44:08,355
and not me?

842
00:44:09,266 --> 00:44:12,065
Have three meals with me
and then decide.

843
00:44:12,295 --> 00:44:13,335
I don't want to.

844
00:44:14,195 --> 00:44:16,666
I don't want to have meals with you.

845
00:44:16,706 --> 00:44:17,735
Why not?

846
00:44:19,605 --> 00:44:21,375
I have my reasons.

847
00:44:22,206 --> 00:44:23,445
Which is?

848
00:44:24,505 --> 00:44:27,246
You said there was a reason
you couldn't like me.

849
00:44:27,246 --> 00:44:29,386
Be honest with me first,
and I'll return the favor.

850
00:44:29,485 --> 00:44:31,215
What is it? I bet you can't tell me.

851
00:44:31,215 --> 00:44:33,556
Then don't ask me
about what I can't tell you either.

852
00:44:33,656 --> 00:44:35,255
I bet it makes you curious.

853
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:36,556
It must get on your nerves.

854
00:44:52,275 --> 00:44:54,206
Judging by how you can't tell me...

855
00:44:54,206 --> 00:44:56,175
proves that there wasn't a reason
to begin with.

856
00:44:57,045 --> 00:44:59,116
You were testing the waters with me.

857
00:44:59,746 --> 00:45:01,375
But now that
I'm dating someone else,

858
00:45:01,375 --> 00:45:03,145
you're poking at me again.

859
00:45:03,585 --> 00:45:06,456
I'm not that gullible, you know.

860
00:45:06,456 --> 00:45:08,616
I know everything that goes on.

861
00:45:08,616 --> 00:45:11,286
So don't test the waters
with me again.

862
00:45:14,755 --> 00:45:16,525
This is driving me crazy.

863
00:45:21,735 --> 00:45:24,536
Hey. Who was that woman
from earlier?

864
00:45:24,536 --> 00:45:26,036
Who had you smiling?

865
00:45:26,235 --> 00:45:29,246
You even lied to Tae Hee
about meeting up with investors.

866
00:45:30,576 --> 00:45:31,945
What woman?

867
00:45:31,945 --> 00:45:33,516
I saw you earlier.

868
00:45:33,516 --> 00:45:35,175
You were on a walk
with another girl.

869
00:45:35,886 --> 00:45:37,545
Are you already seeing
someone else on the side?

870
00:45:37,916 --> 00:45:40,255
What if your aunt
finds out about this?

871
00:45:40,916 --> 00:45:43,255
Jin Dan, you promised to behave.

872
00:45:43,255 --> 00:45:44,925
Aren't you going to marry Tae Hee?

873
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:48,726
What are you talking about?
Of course I'm going to marry her.

874
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:51,366
Then who was that woman
from earlier?

875
00:45:52,395 --> 00:45:53,436
Who is she to me?

876
00:45:54,565 --> 00:45:56,036
Oh, her?

877
00:45:56,866 --> 00:45:59,476
She's an interpreter
for foreign buyers.

878
00:46:00,235 --> 00:46:02,105
Is she the reason you're on my case?

879
00:46:02,545 --> 00:46:05,476
Are you sure nothing's going on?
Is she really an interpreter?

880
00:46:06,116 --> 00:46:07,275
Yes.

881
00:46:11,246 --> 00:46:12,386
What's going on?

882
00:46:13,186 --> 00:46:14,456
Jin Dan, is something up?

883
00:46:14,556 --> 00:46:18,156
Gosh, no.
He played a silly trick on me.

884
00:46:20,156 --> 00:46:22,125
And here I thought
something had happened.

885
00:46:22,695 --> 00:46:25,096
You're lucky to have a son like him.

886
00:46:26,295 --> 00:46:29,306
By the way,
Tae Hee's family reached out.

887
00:46:29,306 --> 00:46:32,105
Tae Hee wants
to bump up the wedding.

888
00:46:32,105 --> 00:46:33,976
- Does she really?
- Yes.

889
00:46:34,735 --> 00:46:36,976
She must be fond of our Jin Dan.

890
00:46:37,306 --> 00:46:39,275
Let's get a date set soon.

891
00:46:39,976 --> 00:46:41,246
Are you okay with that too?

892
00:46:42,686 --> 00:46:45,085
Yes, but...

893
00:46:45,346 --> 00:46:48,985
I think we should take the time
to get to know each other more.

894
00:46:49,226 --> 00:46:51,255
Why bother with that
if you like each other?

895
00:46:51,656 --> 00:46:54,795
Tae Hee's pretty
and pleasant and I love her.

896
00:46:55,695 --> 00:46:58,996
Her family's pleased with you too,
so good luck with her.

897
00:46:59,335 --> 00:47:00,366
Okay.

898
00:47:07,005 --> 00:47:09,275
Jin Dan.
Things are going so well right now.

899
00:47:09,476 --> 00:47:10,775
Don't you dare get in trouble.

900
00:47:11,145 --> 00:47:12,416
I trust in you.

901
00:47:12,945 --> 00:47:14,476
Trust me, Mom.

902
00:47:14,976 --> 00:47:18,085
I'll marry Tae Hee. Don't worry.

903
00:47:20,916 --> 00:47:24,525
Director Ko. There's something
I forgot to tell you yesterday.

904
00:47:25,186 --> 00:47:27,056
The male lead's blind date.

905
00:47:27,596 --> 00:47:28,866
They want you to cast her.

906
00:47:28,996 --> 00:47:31,565
It's the station director
and Director Hong's request.

907
00:47:33,735 --> 00:47:34,735
Do Do?

908
00:47:35,806 --> 00:47:36,936
I've never heard of her.

909
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:39,419
(Do Do, DOB October 23, 2001)

910
00:47:39,419 --> 00:47:41,819
She has zero work experience.

911
00:47:42,127 --> 00:47:43,368
Yes, but...

912
00:47:43,728 --> 00:47:46,138
the station director
made a special request.

913
00:47:47,737 --> 00:47:48,797
The station director?

914
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:51,107
Who is she?

915
00:47:52,113 --> 00:47:53,124
(Baek Mi Ja, Baek Entertainment)

916
00:47:53,124 --> 00:47:55,654
Baek Entertainment, Baek Mi Ja?

917
00:47:56,893 --> 00:47:59,863
It's Park Do Ra's mom's new agency.

918
00:48:00,424 --> 00:48:02,464
I guess that's why
the station director asked.

919
00:48:04,163 --> 00:48:05,194
Say no.

920
00:48:05,763 --> 00:48:06,763
What?

921
00:48:06,904 --> 00:48:09,104
The male lead
goes on this blind date...

922
00:48:09,104 --> 00:48:10,874
after breaking up
with his liar girlfriend.

923
00:48:11,604 --> 00:48:13,203
It's the drama's
last source of conflict.

924
00:48:14,243 --> 00:48:15,643
It's an important scene,

925
00:48:16,214 --> 00:48:17,944
and I can't use someone
with no experience.

926
00:48:18,714 --> 00:48:21,714
Make it clear I said no
and find someone else.

927
00:48:22,953 --> 00:48:23,953
Okay.

928
00:48:33,663 --> 00:48:36,093
Do Sik. Hang in there.

929
00:48:36,093 --> 00:48:37,763
I'll get myself settled...

930
00:48:37,763 --> 00:48:40,404
and open you a store, okay?

931
00:48:40,604 --> 00:48:41,604
Mom.

932
00:48:42,163 --> 00:48:44,334
I don't want or expect that at all.

933
00:48:44,404 --> 00:48:45,874
Please, just don't get into trouble.

934
00:48:46,874 --> 00:48:48,104
I'm going out.

935
00:48:48,404 --> 00:48:49,913
Watch out for motorcycles.

936
00:48:51,814 --> 00:48:52,814
Goodness.

937
00:48:53,143 --> 00:48:55,444
I need to get things
back on track soon...

938
00:48:55,444 --> 00:48:57,254
for Do Jun and Do Sik's sake.

939
00:48:58,113 --> 00:48:59,354
Why won't they call...

940
00:49:01,484 --> 00:49:02,524
Gosh.

941
00:49:05,663 --> 00:49:08,163
- Director Hong.
- Ms. Baek.

942
00:49:08,464 --> 00:49:09,734
I'm so sorry.

943
00:49:10,033 --> 00:49:12,093
I don't think
it'll work out this time.

944
00:49:13,004 --> 00:49:15,104
Why not?
You said it was as good as done.

945
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:17,334
Do Do's a great actor.

946
00:49:17,334 --> 00:49:19,044
I just heard back from the team.

947
00:49:19,243 --> 00:49:20,843
It's too important a role for her.

948
00:49:22,044 --> 00:49:23,113
Is it?

949
00:49:23,314 --> 00:49:25,013
Director Hong.

950
00:49:25,013 --> 00:49:27,783
Can you tell me who the director is?

951
00:49:27,783 --> 00:49:30,783
I'll bring Do Do over
and see if she can impress him.

952
00:49:31,314 --> 00:49:33,124
Will you do that, then?

953
00:49:33,354 --> 00:49:35,154
You know the guy.

954
00:49:35,154 --> 00:49:38,124
It's Ko Pil Seung, my assistant
on "Straightforward Romance."

955
00:49:40,363 --> 00:49:41,363
Who?

956
00:49:41,924 --> 00:49:43,794
Ko Pil Seung?

957
00:49:49,703 --> 00:49:52,504
- Please, Mr. Jang.
- Well...

958
00:49:52,643 --> 00:49:54,343
If she can't have that role,

959
00:49:54,573 --> 00:49:56,243
can you find her something else?

960
00:49:57,544 --> 00:50:00,643
There aren't
any other roles available.

961
00:50:01,544 --> 00:50:03,214
That was just perfect.

962
00:50:04,714 --> 00:50:07,024
But it won't happen
if the director said no.

963
00:50:08,754 --> 00:50:09,754
Ms. Baek.

964
00:50:10,024 --> 00:50:12,794
I'll give you a call
if I find something else.

965
00:50:13,194 --> 00:50:14,893
There's always tomorrow.

966
00:50:14,893 --> 00:50:18,194
There isn't. I go down for good
if this doesn't work.

967
00:50:18,863 --> 00:50:21,163
I need you to get me that role.

968
00:50:22,473 --> 00:50:24,203
Okay. I'll try again.

969
00:50:32,743 --> 00:50:34,143
Why won't he pick up?

970
00:50:37,714 --> 00:50:39,823
Sook Ja. Is Ko Pil Seung there?

971
00:50:40,053 --> 00:50:41,084
He's not picking up.

972
00:50:42,053 --> 00:50:43,854
What? You don't film today?

973
00:50:46,593 --> 00:50:48,564
Sook Ja. Listen.

974
00:50:49,064 --> 00:50:52,263
The thing I asked about.
Is there nothing you can do?

975
00:50:55,734 --> 00:50:57,274
Really?

976
00:50:58,374 --> 00:51:00,674
Okay. Take care.

977
00:51:05,044 --> 00:51:06,113
It's a no.

978
00:51:08,783 --> 00:51:11,354
You know I have
a fancy station director title...

979
00:51:11,354 --> 00:51:12,924
and desk and all,

980
00:51:13,884 --> 00:51:15,024
but I'm powerless.

981
00:51:16,524 --> 00:51:19,694
If the drama director says no,

982
00:51:20,294 --> 00:51:21,624
it's a no.

983
00:51:23,234 --> 00:51:24,834
I'm sorry.

984
00:51:34,104 --> 00:51:35,104
Ms. Baek.

985
00:51:45,584 --> 00:51:48,484
How could I live
in a unit this nice for free?

986
00:51:48,683 --> 00:51:50,024
What gives me the right?

987
00:51:50,393 --> 00:51:53,263
Being my girlfriend
will give you the right.

988
00:51:53,464 --> 00:51:55,124
Then why do you have meals
with Mr. Gong...

989
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:56,933
and not me?

990
00:51:57,163 --> 00:51:58,263
Have three meals with me
and then decide.

991
00:51:58,363 --> 00:51:59,533
Don't date him.

992
00:52:00,234 --> 00:52:02,234
I'm against you seeing him.

993
00:52:03,803 --> 00:52:04,834
Yes.

994
00:52:05,533 --> 00:52:07,544
It's not just because of
what the director said.

995
00:52:07,643 --> 00:52:09,774
Mr. Gong's a bit iffy.

996
00:52:10,643 --> 00:52:12,544
Does it make sense that I can...

997
00:52:12,544 --> 00:52:14,513
live in that fancy apartment
for free?

998
00:52:16,254 --> 00:52:17,783
Grandma said...

999
00:52:17,783 --> 00:52:19,953
nothing in the world's for free.

1000
00:52:20,183 --> 00:52:21,924
You pay for everything in the end.

1001
00:52:22,854 --> 00:52:24,553
If I were to live there for free,

1002
00:52:24,553 --> 00:52:26,294
what else would I have to pay with?

1003
00:52:26,593 --> 00:52:28,863
Is being his girlfriend the price?

1004
00:52:31,134 --> 00:52:34,004
I might have nothing to my name,
but that's wrong.

1005
00:52:39,774 --> 00:52:42,044
We don't film today.

1006
00:52:43,513 --> 00:52:44,573
Hello?

1007
00:52:45,174 --> 00:52:47,484
We don't shoot today.
What's the occasion?

1008
00:52:48,143 --> 00:52:49,953
Ji Young. I need your help.

1009
00:52:50,354 --> 00:52:52,723
Come here, quick. Hurry.

1010
00:52:52,854 --> 00:52:55,323
Goodness.
What's the matter, Director Ko?

1011
00:52:56,794 --> 00:52:58,154
Where are you?

1012
00:52:58,493 --> 00:52:59,763
Director Ko!

1013
00:52:59,763 --> 00:53:02,064
(Seoul International Garden Show)

1014
00:53:02,064 --> 00:53:03,334
What's going on?

1015
00:53:05,734 --> 00:53:07,504
What is happening?

1016
00:53:07,863 --> 00:53:10,134
What happened to the director?

1017
00:53:11,134 --> 00:53:13,143
I've never heard him
speak like that.

1018
00:53:14,203 --> 00:53:15,643
What disaster is he facing?

1019
00:53:18,214 --> 00:53:19,243
Director Ko.

1020
00:53:19,814 --> 00:53:21,243
Where are you?

1021
00:53:21,343 --> 00:53:22,814
Director Ko!

1022
00:53:23,354 --> 00:53:25,214
Ji Young. I'm right here.

1023
00:53:25,714 --> 00:53:28,183
Director Ko. What's going on?

1024
00:53:31,453 --> 00:53:32,624
Are you okay?

1025
00:53:32,723 --> 00:53:34,093
Were you worried about me?

1026
00:53:34,694 --> 00:53:35,794
I'm just fine.

1027
00:53:39,363 --> 00:53:40,363
What?

1028
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:42,263
Did you...

1029
00:53:42,634 --> 00:53:45,573
dupe me and pretend
something had happened?

1030
00:53:46,404 --> 00:53:49,913
Do you know how concerned I was
while I was on the way here?

1031
00:53:50,243 --> 00:53:52,584
I thought my heart would shrivel!

1032
00:53:53,283 --> 00:53:54,283
Gosh.

1033
00:53:55,613 --> 00:53:57,453
Is that how much you care about me?

1034
00:53:58,553 --> 00:53:59,624
I'm so touched.

1035
00:53:59,854 --> 00:54:01,124
Is this a joke?

1036
00:54:01,424 --> 00:54:03,524
Why do you think I went this far?

1037
00:54:03,593 --> 00:54:05,424
I wanted to go on a date with you,

1038
00:54:05,453 --> 00:54:07,624
but I knew you'd say no
if I asked you out.

1039
00:54:07,794 --> 00:54:09,533
I had no choice but to lie.

1040
00:54:10,663 --> 00:54:12,493
For that, I'm sorry.

1041
00:54:12,634 --> 00:54:13,663
Goodness.

1042
00:54:14,933 --> 00:54:16,033
Forget it.

1043
00:54:17,334 --> 00:54:19,904
Ji Young. Let's go on a date.

1044
00:54:20,944 --> 00:54:22,874
At least give me a chance.

1045
00:54:23,544 --> 00:54:25,274
You're not dating Mr. Gong.

1046
00:54:26,044 --> 00:54:27,714
That means you're not two-timing...

1047
00:54:28,044 --> 00:54:29,314
or cheating on him.

1048
00:54:31,183 --> 00:54:32,884
You can do this, Ji Young.

1049
00:54:33,584 --> 00:54:36,354
Go on a date with Mr. Gong
and then with me as well.

1050
00:54:37,093 --> 00:54:40,064
And then decide
who you wish to be with.

1051
00:54:40,893 --> 00:54:43,363
This man is truly a bad man.

1052
00:54:44,933 --> 00:54:48,163
He's a bad man
who's shaking my world.

1053
00:54:48,504 --> 00:54:49,533
Let's go.

1054
00:54:53,073 --> 00:54:56,374
Why am I letting this bad man
drag me off?

1055
00:55:10,453 --> 00:55:11,723
Hello.

1056
00:55:13,464 --> 00:55:14,624
What's this?

1057
00:55:14,763 --> 00:55:16,933
It's a gift
we're handing out to visitors.

1058
00:55:17,393 --> 00:55:18,933
Thank you.

1059
00:55:25,604 --> 00:55:26,703
It's pretty here, isn't it?

1060
00:55:28,303 --> 00:55:31,343
Well, yes. It is pretty.

1061
00:55:33,384 --> 00:55:37,084
You need to bow with thanks
to the flowers.

1062
00:55:37,553 --> 00:55:38,953
If it weren't for them,

1063
00:55:38,953 --> 00:55:40,683
I'd have slapped you for lying.

1064
00:55:41,384 --> 00:55:44,694
I'm letting it slide
because of the pretty flowers.

1065
00:55:45,924 --> 00:55:47,124
Thanks, flowers.

1066
00:55:47,663 --> 00:55:48,924
You saved me.

1067
00:55:56,274 --> 00:55:58,404
Ji Young. Stand here.

1068
00:55:58,904 --> 00:56:00,544
We came to such a great place.

1069
00:56:00,643 --> 00:56:02,274
We should take a photo
as a souvenir.

1070
00:56:04,143 --> 00:56:06,913
I guess you have a point.

1071
00:56:07,984 --> 00:56:11,314
Could you take
a photo of us, please?

1072
00:56:11,453 --> 00:56:13,024
- Sure.
- Thank you.

1073
00:56:18,323 --> 00:56:19,424
Are you ready?

1074
00:56:19,794 --> 00:56:21,593
One, two, three.

1075
00:56:31,634 --> 00:56:33,104
Director Ko and I...

1076
00:56:33,643 --> 00:56:36,044
kind of make a cute couple.

1077
00:56:39,113 --> 00:56:42,444
My gosh, Kim Ji Young.
Why are you being like this again?

1078
00:56:42,444 --> 00:56:45,513
You can't be with Director Ko.
Pull yourself together.

1079
00:57:01,803 --> 00:57:02,803
Hey.

1080
00:57:03,473 --> 00:57:04,634
Ko Myung Dong.

1081
00:57:05,874 --> 00:57:07,174
Today is the day, right?

1082
00:57:08,243 --> 00:57:11,944
They are announcing the winners
of the screenwriting contest today,

1083
00:57:12,343 --> 00:57:13,343
right?

1084
00:57:15,643 --> 00:57:17,283
What? Hey.

1085
00:57:17,783 --> 00:57:21,053
Did you not make the cut again?

1086
00:57:23,723 --> 00:57:25,924
Gosh, this is really upsetting.

1087
00:57:26,363 --> 00:57:29,363
You must remember
that you promised me.

1088
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:30,964
You promised...

1089
00:57:30,964 --> 00:57:33,703
you'd quit writing screenplays
if you failed again.

1090
00:57:33,703 --> 00:57:35,404
You can't change your words
after all this time.

1091
00:57:35,404 --> 00:57:38,274
You have to give up
as you promised, okay?

1092
00:57:38,604 --> 00:57:41,203
Fine! Will you please stop?

1093
00:57:41,203 --> 00:57:44,613
What are you raising your voice for,
by the way?

1094
00:57:49,013 --> 00:57:50,053
What?

1095
00:57:50,654 --> 00:57:52,384
Congratulations, Auntie Myung Dong.

1096
00:57:53,183 --> 00:57:56,053
On what? What are you talking about?

1097
00:57:56,794 --> 00:57:59,053
The winners of the screenwriting contest
were announced today,

1098
00:57:59,053 --> 00:58:00,794
and your name is on the list.

1099
00:58:01,093 --> 00:58:02,093
You won the Excellence Award.

1100
00:58:02,993 --> 00:58:05,763
What? Are you sure, Pil Seung?

1101
00:58:07,134 --> 00:58:09,404
Yes! Okay!

1102
00:58:09,904 --> 00:58:13,404
Why? What's the matter?

1103
00:58:13,404 --> 00:58:16,143
Mom. I think I won.

1104
00:58:16,143 --> 00:58:18,613
- What? Are you serious?
- Yes.

1105
00:58:19,044 --> 00:58:20,243
My goodness.

1106
00:58:22,183 --> 00:58:23,214
Hello?

1107
00:58:24,553 --> 00:58:27,183
Yes. This is Ko Myung Dong.

1108
00:58:28,584 --> 00:58:29,624
What?

1109
00:58:30,254 --> 00:58:31,294
Are you serious?

1110
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:34,593
What?

1111
00:58:35,064 --> 00:58:38,033
Thank you. Thank you so much!

1112
00:58:38,533 --> 00:58:40,334
Why? What's wrong?

1113
00:58:40,334 --> 00:58:42,803
- Mom! My gosh.
- What?

1114
00:58:42,803 --> 00:58:44,634
- It's true.
- What?

1115
00:58:44,634 --> 00:58:46,743
They told me to come to the office
next Wednesday.

1116
00:58:46,743 --> 00:58:48,504
With the necessary documents.

1117
00:58:48,504 --> 00:58:49,774
- My gosh.
- Mom!

1118
00:58:49,774 --> 00:58:53,113
- That's my girl. My dear.
- What do I do?

1119
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:55,683
- You're the best.
- What's going on, Mother?

1120
00:58:56,214 --> 00:58:57,783
- Sun Young.
- Yes?

1121
00:58:57,783 --> 00:59:00,924
Sun Young, Myung Dong finally won.

1122
00:59:00,924 --> 00:59:03,993
Myung Dong is
becoming a screenwriter!

1123
00:59:03,993 --> 00:59:06,564
- My goodness. Are you serious?
- My gosh.

1124
00:59:06,564 --> 00:59:10,033
- Sun Young!
- That's great.

1125
00:59:10,033 --> 00:59:11,533
I can't believe this.

1126
00:59:11,533 --> 00:59:15,533
- I'm so happy for you.
- You finally did it.

1127
00:59:19,874 --> 00:59:21,504
- Mr. Ko.
- Yes.

1128
00:59:21,504 --> 00:59:22,803
Please train him.

1129
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:24,643
Okay.

1130
00:59:25,073 --> 00:59:27,643
Manager Ko Hyun Chul has
the highest seniority here.

1131
00:59:27,643 --> 00:59:29,143
- Make sure to learn a lot from him.
- Yes, sir.

1132
00:59:29,444 --> 00:59:31,384
- And work hard.
- Yes, sir.

1133
00:59:31,384 --> 00:59:32,484
All right.

1134
00:59:33,484 --> 00:59:35,124
Cook it evenly like this.

1135
00:59:35,124 --> 00:59:38,593
And when it's
about 80 percent cooked,

1136
00:59:38,593 --> 00:59:41,024
place it on the grill like this.

1137
00:59:43,294 --> 00:59:44,294
Excuse me.

1138
00:59:46,234 --> 00:59:47,904
One moment.

1139
00:59:47,904 --> 00:59:48,904
Hello?

1140
00:59:49,734 --> 00:59:50,774
Yes, Mom.

1141
00:59:51,703 --> 00:59:54,343
What did you say? Are you sure?

1142
00:59:55,803 --> 00:59:56,814
Well...

1143
00:59:57,544 --> 00:59:58,544
Excuse me.

1144
00:59:58,544 --> 00:59:59,783
Cheers!

1145
00:59:59,783 --> 01:00:01,884
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

1146
01:00:01,884 --> 01:00:04,413
- Congratulations.
- My gosh.

1147
01:00:04,413 --> 01:00:05,553
How nice.

1148
01:00:05,553 --> 01:00:09,024
Congratulations, Myung Dong.
You've been through a lot.

1149
01:00:09,024 --> 01:00:11,524
Congratulations, Myung Dong.

1150
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:14,663
I hope you'll become a writer
with a lot of great drama series.

1151
01:00:14,663 --> 01:00:16,493
Thank you, Sun Young and Hyun Chul.

1152
01:00:16,493 --> 01:00:17,564
All right.

1153
01:00:17,564 --> 01:00:19,363
- Auntie, this is for you.
- My gosh.

1154
01:00:19,363 --> 01:00:21,663
- Really?
- What's that?

1155
01:00:22,234 --> 01:00:24,274
- Gosh, this is nice.
- Where are you going?

1156
01:00:24,274 --> 01:00:26,004
- I'll go get my phone.
- Okay.

1157
01:00:26,004 --> 01:00:28,944
Now I can sleep with no worry.

1158
01:00:28,944 --> 01:00:30,643
I'm so happy.

1159
01:00:30,674 --> 01:00:33,613
Excuse me. Is there anyone in there?

1160
01:00:34,143 --> 01:00:35,613
Who's that? Hey.

1161
01:00:35,613 --> 01:00:37,683
The voice sounds somewhat familiar.

1162
01:00:38,183 --> 01:00:40,553
- What?
- Who is this?

1163
01:00:40,553 --> 01:00:41,553
Who would that be?

1164
01:00:41,783 --> 01:00:43,294
My goodness.

1165
01:00:43,294 --> 01:00:45,453
Hello.

1166
01:00:45,453 --> 01:00:47,524
- My gosh.
- Hello. How are you?

1167
01:00:47,524 --> 01:00:50,634
Hey. What are you doing here?

1168
01:00:50,634 --> 01:00:52,433
How dare you show up here?

1169
01:00:52,433 --> 01:00:53,763
Well, the thing is...

1170
01:00:53,763 --> 01:00:56,004
I called Director Ko,

1171
01:00:56,004 --> 01:00:58,774
and he wasn't answering my call.

1172
01:00:59,743 --> 01:01:02,303
Why would you want
to see my Pil Seung?

1173
01:01:02,303 --> 01:01:03,513
He has nothing to do with you.

1174
01:01:03,513 --> 01:01:06,343
My goodness.
Please don't get me wrong.

1175
01:01:06,944 --> 01:01:10,053
I just need to talk to him
about the actress I'm training.

1176
01:01:10,053 --> 01:01:13,024
So I'd like to meet
with Director Ko.

1177
01:01:13,024 --> 01:01:15,654
Pil Seung, come on down here.

1178
01:01:15,654 --> 01:01:16,654
Okay.

1179
01:01:21,794 --> 01:01:23,064
What are you doing here?

1180
01:01:23,863 --> 01:01:24,863
Gosh.

1181
01:01:27,363 --> 01:01:30,004
Director Ko, I believe you heard.

1182
01:01:30,004 --> 01:01:33,104
I'm here to talk with you
about Do Do.

1183
01:01:35,774 --> 01:01:37,174
Let's talk somewhere else.

1184
01:01:37,814 --> 01:01:39,174
Okay. Sure.

1185
01:01:39,374 --> 01:01:41,413
This is for you. It's a roll cake.

1186
01:01:41,413 --> 01:01:44,854
There was a famous bakery,
so I waited in line to buy this.

1187
01:01:44,854 --> 01:01:46,484
Please enjoy it.

1188
01:01:46,484 --> 01:01:47,624
Here.

1189
01:01:47,624 --> 01:01:48,783
- My goodness.
- Please take it.

1190
01:01:48,783 --> 01:01:49,924
My gosh.

1191
01:01:49,924 --> 01:01:51,453
- Wait.
- Hey, Sun Young.

1192
01:01:51,453 --> 01:01:54,723
What is going on, by the way?

1193
01:01:55,093 --> 01:01:56,564
This is unbelievable.

1194
01:02:00,504 --> 01:02:01,604
Director Ko.

1195
01:02:06,134 --> 01:02:07,803
I think I have made myself clear.

1196
01:02:08,473 --> 01:02:10,513
You can't just show up
at my place like this.

1197
01:02:11,143 --> 01:02:14,814
I wouldn't have shown up like this
if things weren't that bad,

1198
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:16,243
Director Ko.

1199
01:02:16,243 --> 01:02:19,783
Please do me a favor this one time.

1200
01:02:20,683 --> 01:02:23,624
This isn't about doing you a favor.

1201
01:02:24,194 --> 01:02:27,624
She's just not right for the part,
so you will have to accept that.

1202
01:02:27,663 --> 01:02:28,694
You know what?

1203
01:02:30,064 --> 01:02:32,663
After Do Ra left,
I even went to jail.

1204
01:02:32,663 --> 01:02:35,604
And now I live in a tiny room.

1205
01:02:35,763 --> 01:02:37,404
My family got split apart,

1206
01:02:37,404 --> 01:02:40,544
so I don't even know
where Do Jun is now.

1207
01:02:40,944 --> 01:02:42,303
My life had no purpose.

1208
01:02:43,073 --> 01:02:45,174
And I can hardly make ends meet.

1209
01:02:46,374 --> 01:02:48,643
I was in despair
after Do Ra's death.

1210
01:02:49,314 --> 01:02:52,913
So I want to train someone
to be a great actress like Do Ra.

1211
01:02:52,913 --> 01:02:54,553
That's why
I'm back in this business.

1212
01:02:55,683 --> 01:02:58,553
Director Ko,
please help me this once.

1213
01:02:59,194 --> 01:03:00,393
Do Do isn't experienced,

1214
01:03:00,393 --> 01:03:02,163
but I can make it happen.

1215
01:03:02,163 --> 01:03:05,294
You can't just reject her like this.

1216
01:03:05,294 --> 01:03:07,703
It's not like we're total strangers.

1217
01:03:07,703 --> 01:03:09,263
I'm asking you, Director Ko.

1218
01:03:09,803 --> 01:03:12,803
Please do me a favor
this one time, okay?

1219
01:03:12,803 --> 01:03:13,874
I'm sorry.

1220
01:03:14,303 --> 01:03:16,513
I'd like you to leave now.

1221
01:03:16,643 --> 01:03:18,473
I checked her profile,

1222
01:03:18,473 --> 01:03:19,613
and she's not right for the part.

1223
01:03:20,113 --> 01:03:23,613
And please don't show up
at my place ever again.

1224
01:03:25,113 --> 01:03:27,384
Hey! You jerk!

1225
01:03:28,024 --> 01:03:31,524
How dare you treat me like this?

1226
01:03:32,393 --> 01:03:34,263
Now that you're successful,
are you looking down on me?

1227
01:03:34,564 --> 01:03:36,634
You are the reason
I ended up like this.

1228
01:03:36,993 --> 01:03:39,234
If you didn't hit on Do Ra
back then,

1229
01:03:39,234 --> 01:03:41,964
things wouldn't have come to this.

1230
01:03:42,703 --> 01:03:43,703
You...

1231
01:03:44,874 --> 01:03:46,874
Bring my Do Ra back to me, you jerk.

1232
01:03:47,504 --> 01:03:50,374
How dare you kick me out
when I came all the way here?

1233
01:03:50,874 --> 01:03:54,013
Bring my daughter back, you punk!

1234
01:03:54,013 --> 01:03:55,183
My goodness. Director Ko.

1235
01:03:55,183 --> 01:03:57,154
- I want my daughter back!
- What are you doing to him?

1236
01:03:57,154 --> 01:03:59,314
- You idiot.
- Let go of this first.

1237
01:03:59,314 --> 01:04:00,754
- How dare you...
- Please stop it.

1238
01:04:00,754 --> 01:04:02,424
- Ji Young. Don't do this.
- Bring her back.

1239
01:04:02,424 --> 01:04:03,854
Let go of it already!

1240
01:04:03,854 --> 01:04:05,794
- Stop it, Ji Young!
- My gosh.

1241
01:04:06,564 --> 01:04:08,464
My goodness.

1242
01:04:13,734 --> 01:04:14,803
Gosh.

1243
01:04:20,803 --> 01:04:23,544
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1244
01:04:55,743 --> 01:04:58,073
I'm a screenwriter now.

1245
01:04:58,073 --> 01:04:59,913
I'll make money
and become successful.

1246
01:04:59,913 --> 01:05:01,113
So let's start dating again.

1247
01:05:01,113 --> 01:05:02,944
I will take care of you.

1248
01:05:02,944 --> 01:05:04,513
You don't know who she is.

1249
01:05:04,513 --> 01:05:06,553
She's the only daughter
of APP Group's chairman.

1250
01:05:06,553 --> 01:05:07,884
Then is Director Ko...

1251
01:05:07,884 --> 01:05:09,924
going to be the son-in-law
of APP Group?

1252
01:05:09,924 --> 01:05:13,624
So she's from the rich family
that his grandmother talked about.

1253
01:05:13,624 --> 01:05:16,194
When I watched your acting,
I had this feeling.

1254
01:05:16,194 --> 01:05:17,863
You are really talented.

1255
01:05:17,863 --> 01:05:20,464
Will you be the first actress
at my agency?

1256
01:05:20,464 --> 01:05:22,064
Why would you start acting?

1257
01:05:22,203 --> 01:05:23,573
Do you want to be an actress?

1258
01:05:23,573 --> 01:05:25,374
You should never
be an actress, okay?

1259
01:05:25,374 --> 01:05:27,774
Ji Young wants to be an actress
like Park Do Ra?

1260
01:05:27,774 --> 01:05:29,004
What a strange coincidence.

1261
01:05:29,004 --> 01:05:30,913
I just want you...

1262
01:05:30,913 --> 01:05:33,743
to lead a happy life
with no worries like you do now.

1263
01:05:33,743 --> 01:05:35,183
I can't lead a happy life...

1264
01:05:35,183 --> 01:05:37,314
without pursuing acting now.

1265
01:05:37,314 --> 01:05:38,314
Do you understand?

1266
01:05:38,913 --> 01:05:40,870
