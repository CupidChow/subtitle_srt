00:00:00,107 --> 00:00:07,454
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:08,162 --> 00:00:09,492
So tell me.

3
00:00:09,989 --> 00:00:11,758
Tell me that you like me too!

4
00:00:13,128 --> 00:00:14,369
Gong Jin Dan!

5
00:00:33,419 --> 00:00:34,748
Did you just punch me?

6
00:00:35,419 --> 00:00:36,919
Who do you think you are?

7
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:41,488
What do you think you're doing?

8
00:00:41,628 --> 00:00:44,528
Director Ko, please don't!

9
00:00:44,528 --> 00:00:45,658
How dare you cause a scene?

10
00:00:45,698 --> 00:00:48,399
Please stop. Let's head back.

11
00:00:50,298 --> 00:00:53,738
Harass Ji Young again like this,

12
00:00:54,738 --> 00:00:56,039
and I will make you pay.

13
00:00:59,509 --> 00:01:01,048
Ji Young, let's go.

14
00:01:04,548 --> 00:01:06,679
(Episode 25)

15
00:01:10,588 --> 00:01:11,789
Ji Young, are you all right?

16
00:01:12,218 --> 00:01:13,489
I bet that startled you.

17
00:01:14,858 --> 00:01:17,828
Right, but I'm fine.

18
00:01:18,929 --> 00:01:20,159
What happened?

19
00:01:20,629 --> 00:01:22,599
Why was Gong Jin Dan here?

20
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:26,198
He came by to apologize
for how his mother treated me...

21
00:01:26,198 --> 00:01:27,938
at the house.

22
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:32,138
I didn't want to hear about it
nor see him,

23
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,748
but I had to give back
the money his mother threw at me.

24
00:01:35,748 --> 00:01:38,078
I had no reason to take it.

25
00:01:38,948 --> 00:01:42,088
So I met him to return the money,

26
00:01:42,948 --> 00:01:45,918
but Mr. Gong suddenly grabbed me.

27
00:01:47,989 --> 00:01:49,259
I can't believe him.

28
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,429
Ji Young, I'm glad
nothing happened to you.

29
00:01:58,168 --> 00:02:01,168
Director Ko,
I don't care how angry you were.

30
00:02:01,168 --> 00:02:02,838
You shouldn't throw punches.

31
00:02:03,638 --> 00:02:04,638
Ji Young.

32
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:07,478
I don't throw punches
whenever I feel like it.

33
00:02:08,308 --> 00:02:10,549
How could I stand by and let him...

34
00:02:10,549 --> 00:02:11,849
assault you like that?

35
00:02:12,248 --> 00:02:14,119
I will take action...

36
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:15,388
every time he mistreats you.

37
00:02:17,348 --> 00:02:18,359
Director Ko,

38
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:22,829
I think I'm touched.

39
00:02:25,128 --> 00:02:27,128
As if that should move you.

40
00:02:27,128 --> 00:02:29,799
You're my girlfriend,
so of course I should protect you.

41
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:31,739
Aren't you glad
you decided to date me?

42
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:36,169
Don't be alone with him again.

43
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:38,109
Of course not.

44
00:02:38,109 --> 00:02:40,239
Why would I agree
to meet someone like him?

45
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,549
I haven't been shot in the brain.

46
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:44,408
What?

47
00:02:47,848 --> 00:02:49,188
Darn it.

48
00:03:01,028 --> 00:03:02,128
Darn.

49
00:03:10,808 --> 00:03:12,179
Jin Dan, you...

50
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:15,079
Goodness, what happened
to your face?

51
00:03:15,378 --> 00:03:17,949
Who did this to you?
Did someone punch you?

52
00:03:18,848 --> 00:03:21,848
As if. Do you see me
as someone who gets punched?

53
00:03:21,848 --> 00:03:23,718
Then what happened to your face?

54
00:03:23,718 --> 00:03:25,218
Why do you have a busted lip?

55
00:03:25,218 --> 00:03:26,959
And why are your clothes
covered in dirt?

56
00:03:27,258 --> 00:03:29,528
What happened? Tell me this instant.

57
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:31,528
- This is all your fault!
- My goodness.

58
00:03:31,758 --> 00:03:32,929
- But...
- Get out of my room.

59
00:03:32,929 --> 00:03:34,869
- Wait.
- I don't want to talk to you.

60
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:35,968
Jin Dan, wait.

61
00:03:37,938 --> 00:03:39,438
Shoot!

62
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:49,209
Besides, I like someone else,
so don't come looking for me again.

63
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:54,788
What on earth?

64
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:57,119
Is she...

65
00:03:58,288 --> 00:04:00,688
dating that punk Ko Pil Seung?

66
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:04,389
Are you kidding me?

67
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:12,369
Ma Ri.

68
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:15,169
I brought you mango cake.

69
00:04:15,308 --> 00:04:17,239
Do Jun, it's me.
Bring the car upfront.

70
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:21,139
Where are you going?

71
00:04:22,209 --> 00:04:23,348
To Pil Seung's.

72
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:25,219
Ma Ri.

73
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,188
Why would you go there? What now?

74
00:04:31,859 --> 00:04:33,419
To see Pil Seung.

75
00:04:34,628 --> 00:04:37,558
Ma Ri, why are you being this way?

76
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:40,628
Mom, why are you startled?

77
00:04:40,628 --> 00:04:41,698
Are you worried...

78
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,529
I might say something
I'm not supposed to say?

79
00:04:44,568 --> 00:04:46,438
That's shameless of you.

80
00:04:47,698 --> 00:04:48,708
What?

81
00:04:48,869 --> 00:04:52,638
Mom, shouldn't you feel guilty
for what you did...

82
00:04:52,638 --> 00:04:55,078
to Pil Seung and Ms. Kim?

83
00:04:55,078 --> 00:04:58,779
But you're only scared
that I might speak out of line.

84
00:04:59,148 --> 00:05:00,578
Is that all you care about?

85
00:05:01,619 --> 00:05:02,688
Ma Ri, please.

86
00:05:02,888 --> 00:05:05,719
I can't just sit around
like you did.

87
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:10,089
I feel too guilty
for what you did to them...

88
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:12,558
and must do something.

89
00:05:12,558 --> 00:05:15,029
Hey, Ma Ri.

90
00:05:16,998 --> 00:05:19,839
This is a pearl necklace
for Grandma.

91
00:05:20,568 --> 00:05:22,708
- This is a bag for you, Ms. Kim.
- My goodness.

92
00:05:23,869 --> 00:05:25,808
This is a shirt for Mr. Ko.

93
00:05:26,739 --> 00:05:29,578
These are sunglasses for Myung Dong.

94
00:05:29,648 --> 00:05:30,648
- Why...
- Gosh.

95
00:05:30,648 --> 00:05:32,648
But Ma Ri.

96
00:05:33,018 --> 00:05:35,549
What's all this for?

97
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:45,698
For raising Pil Seung so well
into the good man he is,

98
00:05:46,198 --> 00:05:47,698
I want to thank you.

99
00:05:51,498 --> 00:05:53,239
- My gosh.
- Ms. Kim.

100
00:05:53,498 --> 00:05:55,808
You're a real angel.

101
00:05:56,109 --> 00:05:57,138
Thank you.

102
00:05:57,138 --> 00:05:58,839
Thank you so much.

103
00:05:59,378 --> 00:06:00,409
Gosh.

104
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:04,679
What kind of strategy is this?

105
00:06:08,648 --> 00:06:11,758
Ma Ri. What got into you?

106
00:06:12,489 --> 00:06:15,828
Why would you thank us
and what are the gifts for?

107
00:06:18,498 --> 00:06:22,099
I bought the gifts
as a way to apologize.

108
00:06:22,628 --> 00:06:25,739
I scared you a lot by hiding in...

109
00:06:25,739 --> 00:06:27,339
Pil Seung's closet.

110
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:31,169
From now on,
that will never happen again.

111
00:06:32,138 --> 00:06:33,279
Because...

112
00:06:35,179 --> 00:06:38,049
I decided to view Pil Seung
not as a man...

113
00:06:38,049 --> 00:06:40,078
but as an older brother.

114
00:06:40,619 --> 00:06:41,619
What?

115
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,188
Grandma, Ms. Kim,

116
00:06:44,549 --> 00:06:46,258
Mr. Ko, Myung Dong.

117
00:06:47,188 --> 00:06:52,328
From now on, think of me
just as Pil Seung's younger sister.

118
00:07:05,078 --> 00:07:06,279
Look.

119
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:08,578
- This is the male lead's face.
- The TV's too small.

120
00:07:09,549 --> 00:07:10,979
Should I get them a new one?

121
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:21,058
Did she really say she'd
think of Pil Seung as a brother?

122
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:23,359
Yes.

123
00:07:23,388 --> 00:07:26,758
She was mistaken because she grew up
as an only child and felt lonely.

124
00:07:26,758 --> 00:07:28,599
She won't be Pil Seung's girlfriend.

125
00:07:29,698 --> 00:07:33,268
Just imagining kissing him
makes her want to throw up.

126
00:07:33,638 --> 00:07:36,508
No way can she be
his girlfriend, then.

127
00:07:36,508 --> 00:07:37,739
That's never possible.

128
00:07:38,138 --> 00:07:39,739
She said she'd visit often...

129
00:07:39,739 --> 00:07:42,308
as Pil Seung's younger sister.

130
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:46,878
She does this one moment
and that the next and it's crazy.

131
00:07:47,318 --> 00:07:49,849
She really is a bit weird.

132
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:54,359
We let her manipulate us
without knowing it.

133
00:07:55,258 --> 00:07:59,029
I like it much more that she
changed her mind about Pil Seung.

134
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:04,099
Ms. Kim, when will
the spicy cold noodles be ready?

135
00:08:04,268 --> 00:08:06,599
Just a moment, Ma Ri.

136
00:08:09,008 --> 00:08:10,568
It's done.

137
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:14,638
My daughter Ma Ri said that?

138
00:08:15,148 --> 00:08:17,148
Yes. She said
she must've been lonely...

139
00:08:17,148 --> 00:08:19,748
because she grew up an only child.

140
00:08:20,148 --> 00:08:22,549
She liked Pil Seung
as he was like an older brother.

141
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:25,688
She was mistaken that she wanted to
be his girlfriend.

142
00:08:25,989 --> 00:08:29,089
She doesn't want to marry him.
She just wants to be his sister.

143
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,159
I see.

144
00:08:33,328 --> 00:08:36,198
She sincerely apologized
for hiding in the closet,

145
00:08:36,198 --> 00:08:39,138
and she even thanked me...

146
00:08:39,398 --> 00:08:42,908
for raising Pil Seung
to be the good man he is.

147
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:45,579
Did she really?

148
00:08:46,979 --> 00:08:50,579
Anyway, Soo Yeon.
Ma Ri bought us all a gift.

149
00:08:50,648 --> 00:08:52,719
A designer bag, clothes...

150
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:55,949
Everything looked so expensive.

151
00:08:56,548 --> 00:08:59,359
We couldn't accept them,
so I put them all aside.

152
00:08:59,359 --> 00:09:00,658
I'll return them when we next meet.

153
00:09:00,658 --> 00:09:03,189
Why would you say that?

154
00:09:03,989 --> 00:09:07,998
Ma Ri wanted to give you something,
so accept them and don't feel bad.

155
00:09:08,528 --> 00:09:10,199
She must've gone shopping...

156
00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:12,839
because she felt terrible
and wanted to thank you too.

157
00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:15,969
That would make Ma Ri feel better.

158
00:09:16,268 --> 00:09:17,439
Please keep them.

159
00:09:17,638 --> 00:09:18,739
Goodness.

160
00:09:19,408 --> 00:09:21,138
Okay, then.

161
00:09:21,849 --> 00:09:24,809
Anyway,
I called to say Ma Ri's fine.

162
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,349
We had spicy cold noodles,

163
00:09:27,349 --> 00:09:30,449
and she gets along so well
with my mother-in-law.

164
00:09:30,888 --> 00:09:34,158
Okay. I'm sorry
about the nuisance, Sun Young.

165
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:38,498
Ma Ri's hard to look after,
isn't she?

166
00:09:39,798 --> 00:09:41,599
I'm sorry for the trouble.

167
00:09:41,699 --> 00:09:44,298
Why would you say that?

168
00:09:44,469 --> 00:09:46,369
It's not like that at all.

169
00:09:46,638 --> 00:09:49,869
Don't worry.
Ma Ri's as good as my daughter too.

170
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:54,609
You have no idea how much
I enjoy her chatter when she visits.

171
00:09:55,048 --> 00:09:58,319
Our house was so quiet,
but now it's full of laughter.

172
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:04,418
Pil Seung's an only child
and so is Ma Ri.

173
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:07,689
It would be nice if they could
get along well like siblings.

174
00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:10,158
Hearing you say that...

175
00:10:11,699 --> 00:10:14,699
makes me so happy, Sun Young.

176
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:17,229
Thanks a lot.

177
00:10:17,428 --> 00:10:19,199
Not that again.

178
00:10:19,398 --> 00:10:21,199
Why do you always say that?

179
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:24,508
Anyway, Ma Ri wanted to
see Pil Seung,

180
00:10:24,508 --> 00:10:25,579
so I'll send her home later.

181
00:10:25,979 --> 00:10:27,479
Okay. Bye.

182
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:39,989
Sun Young.

183
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:45,398
Thanks so much, Sun Young.

184
00:11:02,748 --> 00:11:03,878
Goodness.

185
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:06,748
Why are you back here?

186
00:11:06,748 --> 00:11:09,648
Kim Ji Young.
Were you two-timing us?

187
00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:12,559
What? What are you talking about?

188
00:11:12,859 --> 00:11:13,918
You don't know?

189
00:11:14,518 --> 00:11:16,028
You were dating Pil Seung,

190
00:11:16,388 --> 00:11:18,559
but when I asked you out,
you said you'd think about it.

191
00:11:19,628 --> 00:11:21,869
You led me on and gave me hope,

192
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:23,329
and now it's a no?

193
00:11:24,369 --> 00:11:27,339
Compensate me
for toying with my feelings.

194
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:33,309
Mr. Gong. You know,

195
00:11:33,878 --> 00:11:37,508
I never led you on or gave you hope.

196
00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:41,018
You told me to treat you
in return for the damaged suit.

197
00:11:41,788 --> 00:11:43,648
I had little money then,

198
00:11:43,719 --> 00:11:46,489
and I was so grateful
you let me buy you dinner...

199
00:11:46,489 --> 00:11:48,388
instead of a new suit.

200
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:51,059
That's the only reason
I ate out with you.

201
00:11:53,229 --> 00:11:55,768
Hey. Do you call that
an explanation?

202
00:11:56,569 --> 00:11:58,898
You shouldn't have said
you'd think about it, then.

203
00:11:59,239 --> 00:12:03,168
I explained to you last time
why I had to say that.

204
00:12:04,138 --> 00:12:06,209
I had to buy you one more meal,

205
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:07,878
and if I were to reject you then,

206
00:12:07,878 --> 00:12:10,109
it would make the last meal awkward.

207
00:12:10,178 --> 00:12:11,609
That's why I said
I'd think about it.

208
00:12:13,048 --> 00:12:16,148
Also, I said
I'd think about dating you.

209
00:12:16,349 --> 00:12:18,819
I never said
I was interested in you.

210
00:12:19,219 --> 00:12:22,158
If I'd known
you'd get such a wrong idea,

211
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,498
I'd have taken out a loan
to pay you for the suit.

212
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:29,528
I said my part and I'm busy,
so I have to dash.

213
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:31,099
Hey.

214
00:12:31,469 --> 00:12:33,268
I'm not done talking.
You can't leave.

215
00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:36,109
If you don't let go,

216
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:38,939
I'll tell my boyfriend
the director...

217
00:12:39,038 --> 00:12:41,678
to beat you up again.

218
00:12:41,979 --> 00:12:43,548
- Do you get that?
- What?

219
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:48,689
Go and spoil the woman
you're going to marry.

220
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:51,319
What a nuisance.

221
00:12:52,319 --> 00:12:53,918
Don't come here again.

222
00:12:54,388 --> 00:12:55,689
You're not welcome.

223
00:12:59,658 --> 00:13:00,959
That country bumpkin...

224
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:03,628
What should I do about her?

225
00:13:04,798 --> 00:13:07,498
Gosh. You country bumpkin...

226
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,038
Don't call me that!

227
00:13:13,349 --> 00:13:15,038
(Queen Mother)

228
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:16,809
What do you want?

229
00:13:19,248 --> 00:13:20,248
What?

230
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:22,319
Tae Hee?

231
00:13:22,349 --> 00:13:23,349
I see.

232
00:13:23,849 --> 00:13:26,189
- I'm back.
- Hello.

233
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:28,658
Hello, Jin Dan.

234
00:13:28,758 --> 00:13:29,859
Tae Hee.

235
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:32,729
What happened? Why didn't you call?

236
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:34,699
I'd have gone to pick you up.

237
00:13:35,628 --> 00:13:37,128
I wanted to surprise you.

238
00:13:37,729 --> 00:13:39,839
Your mother invited me.

239
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:41,369
Did she?

240
00:13:42,109 --> 00:13:44,768
Chairman Gong and Auntie
were curious and wanted to meet her.

241
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:48,479
You should visit her family too now.

242
00:13:49,778 --> 00:13:53,119
So, when are your parents free
to meet with our family?

243
00:13:53,349 --> 00:13:56,619
They told me to ask if you're free
for lunch next weekend.

244
00:13:57,989 --> 00:13:59,959
Chairman Gong. Are you free then?

245
00:14:00,918 --> 00:14:02,158
I'll make myself free.

246
00:14:02,158 --> 00:14:04,158
This is a great
and welcome family event.

247
00:14:05,658 --> 00:14:08,628
Soo Yeon, you should help out too.

248
00:14:09,498 --> 00:14:10,528
Yes, Auntie.

249
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,138
- Have some of this.
- Thanks.

250
00:14:27,378 --> 00:14:28,819
Did you take Tae Hee home?

251
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:32,319
Mom.

252
00:14:33,518 --> 00:14:36,359
Why did you invite her over?
What are you up to?

253
00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:39,059
And what's
the sudden family meet-up about?

254
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:40,998
It's not sudden.

255
00:14:41,099 --> 00:14:42,969
We'd been talking about it.

256
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:46,839
What? Do you have regrets
about the other girl?

257
00:14:47,398 --> 00:14:48,668
Is this about her?

258
00:14:49,038 --> 00:14:51,408
Do you want me to
rip into her hair once more?

259
00:14:51,878 --> 00:14:54,709
Mom. If you do that
to Ji Young once more,

260
00:14:55,138 --> 00:14:56,748
no one knows how I might react.

261
00:14:56,748 --> 00:14:58,079
Get a grip, Gong Jin Dan.

262
00:15:01,148 --> 00:15:04,388
I put up with and covered up
all your crazy antics...

263
00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:07,059
and waited for you.

264
00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:11,229
"It won't last forever.
He'll come round."

265
00:15:11,788 --> 00:15:13,459
But why are you being like this?

266
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:15,699
How far are you going to take this?

267
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:21,869
Jin Dan.

268
00:15:23,239 --> 00:15:25,069
You can't be doing this to Tae Hee.

269
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:28,109
It was no big deal...

270
00:15:28,109 --> 00:15:30,408
to end things with the girls
you were seeing before,

271
00:15:31,008 --> 00:15:32,719
but Tae Hee is different.

272
00:15:34,378 --> 00:15:36,888
Think of Auntie, Jin Taek,
and even Soo Yeon.

273
00:15:37,548 --> 00:15:40,589
They all are excited
about your wedding with Tae Hee.

274
00:15:41,158 --> 00:15:44,559
But how could you get distracted
by such a lame girl like her?

275
00:15:45,498 --> 00:15:49,199
Do you really not mind
losing everything you have now?

276
00:15:52,898 --> 00:15:53,998
No, Mom.

277
00:15:55,069 --> 00:15:56,538
I'm not all that crazy.

278
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:01,739
I won't be like that now.
It won't happen again.

279
00:16:03,248 --> 00:16:04,309
Are you sure?

280
00:16:05,178 --> 00:16:06,518
Do you really mean it?

281
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:10,248
Fine.

282
00:16:10,788 --> 00:16:14,388
I can't give up on everything
just because of a lowlife like her.

283
00:16:16,528 --> 00:16:18,859
Mom, I told you.

284
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:20,928
I won't lose Tae Hee.

285
00:16:21,628 --> 00:16:23,599
I'll marry her no matter that.

286
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:26,569
I knew it. You will, right?

287
00:16:27,369 --> 00:16:28,939
I trust you.

288
00:16:29,638 --> 00:16:30,908
Of course.

289
00:16:37,979 --> 00:16:39,079
I'm finished.

290
00:16:39,648 --> 00:16:41,079
Where are you, Ji Young?

291
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:42,489
Is the script-reading over?

292
00:16:42,489 --> 00:16:43,640
(Ms. Kim Ji Young)

293
00:16:59,869 --> 00:17:03,354
I'm so sorry, Director Ko.
I'm not finished yet.

294
00:17:03,869 --> 00:17:06,439
Since we're doing the shoot
next week, Director Hong...

295
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:08,638
and the actors want
to practice reading until late.

296
00:17:08,638 --> 00:17:10,048
You should go home without me.

297
00:17:11,678 --> 00:17:12,948
You want me to go home alone?

298
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:16,549
I'm bored when I go home by myself.

299
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:17,888
My gosh.

300
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:20,359
This is just getting
worse and worse.

301
00:17:21,158 --> 00:17:23,688
How did you manage
without me before?

302
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:25,359
You must've been bored.

303
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,658
This won't do.

304
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,928
I should call Director Hong
and ask him to wrap things up.

305
00:17:30,468 --> 00:17:32,039
So we can go home together
having a date.

306
00:17:32,168 --> 00:17:35,408
What? Gosh, you can't do that.

307
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:38,609
I'm joking.
You fall for that every time.

308
00:17:42,009 --> 00:17:44,579
You worked hard today.

309
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:46,049
You should go home early
and get some rest.

310
00:17:46,718 --> 00:17:48,349
I'll text you when I'm done.

311
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:50,188
Okay.

312
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:54,859
Now that we're not
going on a date tonight,

313
00:17:56,428 --> 00:17:58,559
you should at least give me a hug.
Then I'll go home.

314
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:00,958
My goodness.

315
00:18:04,898 --> 00:18:06,039
Fine.

316
00:18:06,999 --> 00:18:10,369
Just hug me before anyone sees us.

317
00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:20,948
Did you watch "Lovely Runner?"

318
00:18:20,948 --> 00:18:22,148
- My gosh.
- It's really fun.

319
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:25,249
I'm sorry, Director Ko.
I should get going.

320
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:26,958
I know.

321
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:29,559
What are you doing, Director Ko?

322
00:18:30,658 --> 00:18:31,759
Did you fall?

323
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:34,398
No. It's just that
my shoelaces came undone.

324
00:18:36,398 --> 00:18:37,529
I see.

325
00:18:41,898 --> 00:18:42,938
We will go on ahead then.

326
00:18:42,938 --> 00:18:43,968
Bye.

327
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:50,678
Grandma, it's really fun
to hear about Pil Seung.

328
00:18:50,678 --> 00:18:52,349
Tell me more about him.

329
00:18:52,349 --> 00:18:55,718
All right then. Do you want to hear
about Pil Seung's childhood now?

330
00:18:55,948 --> 00:18:58,049
- His childhood? That sounds great.
- Yes.

331
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:00,718
I think it was
after his first birthday...

332
00:19:00,718 --> 00:19:03,888
when he was crawling around.

333
00:19:04,688 --> 00:19:06,698
Pil Seung was sitting
right next to us,

334
00:19:06,698 --> 00:19:09,499
but when we looked at him
a little later, he was missing.

335
00:19:10,198 --> 00:19:12,599
He went missing? Where did he go?

336
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:13,968
We had no idea back then.

337
00:19:13,968 --> 00:19:16,509
We all were surprised,
so we looked for him everywhere...

338
00:19:16,509 --> 00:19:18,109
searching the whole house.

339
00:19:18,109 --> 00:19:19,378
And you know what?

340
00:19:19,378 --> 00:19:21,809
He was a little baby
crawling around on all fours,

341
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:23,878
so I have no idea
how he could get there,

342
00:19:23,878 --> 00:19:25,549
but he was found on the rooftop.

343
00:19:25,549 --> 00:19:26,878
- On the rooftop?
- Yes.

344
00:19:26,878 --> 00:19:28,918
So? Didn't he get hurt?

345
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:32,119
So our whole family was worried...

346
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:34,388
if he'd fall off.

347
00:19:34,388 --> 00:19:36,059
We were shaking in fear.

348
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:37,589
But she's a mom, after all.

349
00:19:37,589 --> 00:19:39,559
Pil Seung's mom, Sun Young...

350
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:42,198
crept up the stairs
to the rooftop...

351
00:19:42,198 --> 00:19:45,099
and caught Pil Seung right away.

352
00:19:46,898 --> 00:19:48,638
- Thank goodness.
- My gosh.

353
00:19:48,638 --> 00:19:50,269
I'm so relieved.

354
00:19:50,738 --> 00:19:53,408
Ms. Kim, you're unbelievable.

355
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,109
What?

356
00:19:55,378 --> 00:19:58,918
And Grandma, Mr. Ko, and Myung Dong.

357
00:19:59,249 --> 00:20:01,178
You all raised Pil Seung well...

358
00:20:01,178 --> 00:20:03,819
into a healthy and brave man.

359
00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:05,958
You must've been through a lot.

360
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,319
I should thank you all.

361
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,829
I will never forget
what you've done.

362
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:14,599
Oh, dear. How sweet.

363
00:20:15,829 --> 00:20:16,829
I'm home.

364
00:20:16,829 --> 00:20:18,668
- Pil Seung.
- Hey.

365
00:20:20,898 --> 00:20:22,039
Ms. Ma Ri.

366
00:20:22,269 --> 00:20:23,309
Well...

367
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:26,809
Pil Seung.

368
00:20:28,908 --> 00:20:30,079
Yes, Ms. Ma Ri.

369
00:20:31,109 --> 00:20:34,079
Please don't call me Ms. Ma Ri.

370
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:36,349
Just call me Ma Ri instead.

371
00:20:36,349 --> 00:20:37,488
Because...

372
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:43,532
I just want to be
your younger sister.

373
00:20:43,888 --> 00:20:46,428
So you can speak casually to me.

374
00:20:50,468 --> 00:20:51,468
Can I do that?

375
00:20:52,869 --> 00:20:54,099
Fine, Ma Ri.

376
00:20:54,698 --> 00:20:55,708
All right.

377
00:20:56,408 --> 00:20:57,839
Pil Seung, you know,

378
00:20:58,908 --> 00:21:00,478
I grew up as an only child,

379
00:21:00,478 --> 00:21:02,648
so I've always wanted
an older brother.

380
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:06,079
What I wanted was
an older brother like you.

381
00:21:07,579 --> 00:21:09,718
I was being silly and confused,

382
00:21:09,718 --> 00:21:11,519
so I asked you to be my boyfriend.

383
00:21:12,988 --> 00:21:16,428
Pil Seung, I'm sorry
for what I've done.

384
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,059
I apologize.

385
00:21:23,128 --> 00:21:24,128
I see.

386
00:21:24,829 --> 00:21:27,599
Yes. So I never want you...

387
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:29,908
to be my boyfriend anymore.

388
00:21:29,908 --> 00:21:32,039
It will never happen again.

389
00:21:32,779 --> 00:21:36,749
So can I just hang out with you...

390
00:21:36,908 --> 00:21:40,579
like an older brother
and a younger sister?

391
00:21:40,678 --> 00:21:43,289
Of course. I'd love that.

392
00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:45,789
I'm glad I got a younger sister.

393
00:21:46,718 --> 00:21:49,428
Really? Thank you so much.

394
00:21:49,428 --> 00:21:51,728
Now that we're
a brother and a sister,

395
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:53,658
we should shake hands
to celebrate it.

396
00:21:59,535 --> 00:22:00,765
I heard...

397
00:22:01,567 --> 00:22:03,567
Pil Seung and you will be like
a brother and a sister.

398
00:22:04,097 --> 00:22:06,666
Yes. At first, I hated you...

399
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:09,797
and had a hard time understanding
why you did such a thing.

400
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:13,136
But Pil Seung said
he'd be my brother,

401
00:22:13,136 --> 00:22:15,436
so I don't hate you as much anymore.

402
00:22:15,436 --> 00:22:18,837
And I'm grateful that you got me
a great brother like him.

403
00:22:21,277 --> 00:22:22,277
Ma Ri.

404
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:27,547
Thank you so much for saying so.

405
00:22:29,686 --> 00:22:32,757
Mom, I'm just grateful...

406
00:22:32,757 --> 00:22:34,226
that you got me a brother.

407
00:22:34,226 --> 00:22:36,156
But I still don't understand you.

408
00:22:36,156 --> 00:22:37,597
If I were Pil Seung,

409
00:22:37,597 --> 00:22:39,656
I would never forgive you.

410
00:22:44,067 --> 00:22:46,837
Speaking of which, Mom,

411
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,037
if you feel bad for Pil Seung,
you should be nice to him.

412
00:22:51,906 --> 00:22:52,906
What?

413
00:22:53,107 --> 00:22:56,077
Mom, I want to share
what I have with Pil Seung.

414
00:22:56,176 --> 00:22:59,176
How can we make him
as rich as we are now?

415
00:22:59,176 --> 00:23:00,987
What should I do
to share what I have with him?

416
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:05,257
I can't tell Dad that
I want to share things with him.

417
00:23:05,257 --> 00:23:07,787
We can't tell Dad about Pil Seung.

418
00:23:08,757 --> 00:23:11,726
How can we share
what we have with him?

419
00:23:14,827 --> 00:23:16,497
Thank you, Ma Ri.

420
00:23:18,136 --> 00:23:20,966
You are a way smarter
and better person...

421
00:23:21,866 --> 00:23:23,636
than I am, Ma Ri.

422
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:27,107
You really are.

423
00:23:29,946 --> 00:23:31,616
("Don't Lie" Got off to a Good Start
With a Rating of 15.2 Percent)

424
00:23:33,587 --> 00:23:35,347
(Number 1 on Streaming Service!
Now streaming)

425
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,817
(KMS Has Revived After 2 Years
Since "Straightforward Romance")

426
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:39,386
(The First Episode of "Don't Lie"
Recorded the Rating of 15.2 Percent)

427
00:23:40,186 --> 00:23:42,886
It's not just popular,
but it's a huge hit?

428
00:23:43,027 --> 00:23:44,297
Yes, it is.

429
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:46,926
The first episode recorded
a rating of over 15.2 percent.

430
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,497
- My goodness.
- A rating like this...

431
00:23:48,497 --> 00:23:50,396
is like a miracle these days.

432
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:52,567
My goodness.

433
00:23:53,237 --> 00:23:55,936
This is amazing news.

434
00:23:56,107 --> 00:23:57,876
My dear Pil Seung.

435
00:23:57,876 --> 00:24:00,876
Hang on.
Then what is going to happen...

436
00:24:00,876 --> 00:24:02,547
to Pil Seung now?

437
00:24:02,847 --> 00:24:05,916
He will be offered jobs everywhere.

438
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:07,317
After a big hit like this,

439
00:24:07,317 --> 00:24:09,416
he will receive job offers
from all the companies in the industry.

440
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:11,287
That's so cool.

441
00:24:11,357 --> 00:24:15,587
He'll then take on the job
that pays the most.

442
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:16,956
Mother, no.

443
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:19,896
That means he'll have
to quit the broadcasting station.

444
00:24:19,997 --> 00:24:23,866
Sun Young, please.
Many directors freelance these days.

445
00:24:23,866 --> 00:24:26,737
The industry isn't like
how it was before.

446
00:24:26,737 --> 00:24:28,666
Still, I want Pil Seung...

447
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:31,136
to have a solid job at a company.

448
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,636
One that will let him work
until he retires.

449
00:24:33,176 --> 00:24:34,476
Remember how his father...

450
00:24:34,946 --> 00:24:38,116
quit his job and made a huge fuss
about starting a business?

451
00:24:38,116 --> 00:24:41,386
The anxiety I felt
and all that upset me...

452
00:24:41,686 --> 00:24:44,787
The last thing I want is
for Pil Seung to suffer like that.

453
00:24:45,156 --> 00:24:47,027
The sufferings from back then...

454
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,386
are enough to still wake me
from my sleep.

455
00:24:49,527 --> 00:24:50,527
Sun Young.

456
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:54,666
Do you have to bring up
Hyun Chul's failure at this moment?

457
00:24:55,226 --> 00:24:56,866
Mother, that's not what I meant.

458
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:02,507
Anyway Myung Dong,
don't give him any ideas like that.

459
00:25:03,107 --> 00:25:04,206
All right.

460
00:25:04,406 --> 00:25:06,136
But he's not one to listen to me...

461
00:25:06,136 --> 00:25:08,307
even when I give him ideas.

462
00:25:08,547 --> 00:25:09,646
- Gosh.
- Seriously though.

463
00:25:09,646 --> 00:25:11,716
What good does his success do...

464
00:25:11,716 --> 00:25:13,017
when someone else
will benefit from it?

465
00:25:13,317 --> 00:25:15,987
Mom, come on.
Why would you say that?

466
00:25:15,987 --> 00:25:18,557
Can you blame me for saying so?

467
00:25:18,557 --> 00:25:21,527
She isn't just a hillbilly
who has nothing to her name.

468
00:25:21,557 --> 00:25:22,626
He fell for a vixen...

469
00:25:22,626 --> 00:25:25,027
who seduced
a soon-to-be-married man.

470
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:27,426
Why is it that Pil Seung...

471
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:30,396
has the worst taste in women?

472
00:25:31,866 --> 00:25:33,607
Don't worry, Mother.

473
00:25:33,936 --> 00:25:36,136
Pil Seung will soon snap out of it.

474
00:25:36,237 --> 00:25:40,307
As if. They live close by and
are together at work all the time.

475
00:25:40,307 --> 00:25:42,077
They'll be glued to the hip!

476
00:25:42,077 --> 00:25:43,107
Mom!

477
00:25:43,307 --> 00:25:45,676
What? It's not like I'm wrong.

478
00:25:46,146 --> 00:25:47,287
Stop it.

479
00:25:49,847 --> 00:25:52,916
Director Ko, did you give
my proposal some thought?

480
00:25:54,027 --> 00:25:56,857
Yes, and I appreciate
how you've been coming to see me...

481
00:25:56,857 --> 00:25:58,797
to talk about your offer.

482
00:25:59,956 --> 00:26:03,126
But I don't have enough experience
to quit the broadcasting station...

483
00:26:03,366 --> 00:26:04,497
and work as a freelancer.

484
00:26:05,037 --> 00:26:06,497
It doesn't seem like the right time.

485
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:09,807
Goodness. How so?
Was the offer not good enough?

486
00:26:11,337 --> 00:26:12,737
That isn't the case,

487
00:26:13,946 --> 00:26:16,847
but I don't think
I'm ready to quit my job...

488
00:26:16,847 --> 00:26:18,277
at the broadcasting station.

489
00:26:18,916 --> 00:26:21,747
Let us revisit this idea
some other time.

490
00:26:22,587 --> 00:26:25,216
All right. I'll think about it,

491
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:28,426
and come to you again
with an offer too good...

492
00:26:28,426 --> 00:26:29,827
that is impossible to reject.

493
00:26:30,186 --> 00:26:32,797
When I do,
strongly consider my offer.

494
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:33,966
Sure thing.

495
00:26:34,567 --> 00:26:36,027
- You should take that.
- Right.

496
00:26:36,226 --> 00:26:37,636
- I'll be in touch.
- Sure.

497
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:40,267
- Thank you.
- Right.

498
00:26:43,507 --> 00:26:44,507
Hey.

499
00:26:46,307 --> 00:26:47,307
The station director?

500
00:26:49,176 --> 00:26:50,176
Pil Seung.

501
00:26:50,847 --> 00:26:52,547
Rumor has it...

502
00:26:52,547 --> 00:26:54,587
that the best production houses
in the business...

503
00:26:55,317 --> 00:26:58,317
are all trying
to sign a deal with you.

504
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:02,287
I bet you've been receiving
a lot of offers.

505
00:27:02,656 --> 00:27:03,757
It's not that much.

506
00:27:04,557 --> 00:27:07,497
Have you not been meeting
with production houses?

507
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:11,136
That I have.

508
00:27:12,237 --> 00:27:13,466
Pil Seung, look.

509
00:27:14,807 --> 00:27:18,706
If you think about it, you could say
I helped build your career.

510
00:27:19,107 --> 00:27:22,047
So for you to quit
the broadcasting station?

511
00:27:22,277 --> 00:27:24,047
If I'm being harsh,

512
00:27:24,716 --> 00:27:26,216
it's a betrayal.

513
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:29,686
What I'm saying is that...
you should stay...

514
00:27:30,557 --> 00:27:31,716
centered.

515
00:27:31,757 --> 00:27:34,156
You're making it sound
like we went out.

516
00:27:34,156 --> 00:27:35,257
How is this a betrayal?

517
00:27:35,827 --> 00:27:39,557
Pil Seung, the world
only seems like a nice place...

518
00:27:39,726 --> 00:27:42,626
because you're seeing it
from under our roof.

519
00:27:42,997 --> 00:27:44,567
This is a greenhouse,

520
00:27:44,567 --> 00:27:48,107
and it's the Himalayas out there.
You'll be walking on thin ice.

521
00:27:48,237 --> 00:27:49,666
Come on, Mr. Jang.

522
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:52,636
Why are you scaring
a director on the rise?

523
00:27:52,777 --> 00:27:54,446
What do you mean I'm scaring you?

524
00:27:54,476 --> 00:27:56,946
I'm worried about you,

525
00:27:56,946 --> 00:27:58,847
and I want you
to be smart about this.

526
00:27:59,376 --> 00:28:01,487
All right. I'll keep that in mind.

527
00:28:02,487 --> 00:28:04,956
Of course.
Don't make hasty decisions,

528
00:28:05,857 --> 00:28:06,916
and stay put.

529
00:28:07,827 --> 00:28:08,857
What?

530
00:28:09,557 --> 00:28:11,497
You want to run
a drama production house?

531
00:28:13,357 --> 00:28:15,797
Honey, that's out of the blue.

532
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:17,466
It's not sudden.

533
00:28:17,466 --> 00:28:19,567
I've been mentioning it
for years now.

534
00:28:19,696 --> 00:28:21,966
You said we'd revisit the idea
after I gained experience...

535
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:23,307
running the store.

536
00:28:24,607 --> 00:28:26,976
Yes, that's something I said.

537
00:28:28,077 --> 00:28:31,047
Don't you believe in me, honey?
You seem doubtful.

538
00:28:31,847 --> 00:28:34,587
Of course I believe in you.
It's a bit sudden, that's all.

539
00:28:35,446 --> 00:28:37,017
Dad, don't argue with her on this...

540
00:28:37,017 --> 00:28:38,817
and just let her do what she wants.

541
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:40,686
A man should keep his promise.

542
00:28:43,587 --> 00:28:45,896
Sure. I made a promise
and I should keep it.

543
00:28:46,827 --> 00:28:48,797
How well you ran the store...

544
00:28:48,926 --> 00:28:50,997
does imply that you'll do a good job
running the production house.

545
00:28:52,196 --> 00:28:53,196
Goodness.

546
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:55,837
Thanks, honey.

547
00:28:57,607 --> 00:28:59,936
Dad, thanks. I love you so much.

548
00:29:00,136 --> 00:29:04,077
Ma Ri seems to be more thrilled
with you running a production house.

549
00:29:04,646 --> 00:29:06,277
Are you that delighted?

550
00:29:06,676 --> 00:29:09,547
Weren't you furious with your mother
these past few days?

551
00:29:11,017 --> 00:29:14,626
When did the two of you make up?

552
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,156
Dad, a quarrel between
a mom and daughter...

553
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:19,426
is like cutting water with a knife.

554
00:29:20,027 --> 00:29:22,797
What? Cutting water with a knife?

555
00:29:28,237 --> 00:29:29,866
Where did you learn that saying?

556
00:29:35,077 --> 00:29:37,317
Ji Young. Here.

557
00:29:39,317 --> 00:29:42,747
Mr. Lee, the anxiety might kill me.

558
00:29:44,087 --> 00:29:46,257
My heart is beating out of my chest,

559
00:29:46,656 --> 00:29:48,926
and I can't remember
any of my lines.

560
00:29:49,327 --> 00:29:51,797
My head hurts, and I feel queasy.

561
00:29:52,626 --> 00:29:55,527
What? Ji Young, hold on.

562
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:59,997
I'll get you a calming drink,
so try to hang in there.

563
00:30:06,507 --> 00:30:07,547
Gosh.

564
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:10,577
What do I do?
Filming will start any time soon.

565
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,517
Why am I this nervous?

566
00:30:27,896 --> 00:30:29,027
Director Ko.

567
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,896
Ji Young, you must be nervous
with this being your first day.

568
00:30:32,767 --> 00:30:34,507
I wish I could be there with you,

569
00:30:35,136 --> 00:30:36,767
but I had too many meetings.

570
00:30:37,577 --> 00:30:38,577
Are you all right?

571
00:30:38,906 --> 00:30:42,507
Yes, I'm... I'm fine.

572
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:46,247
Besides, I would've been
more nervous with you here.

573
00:30:46,476 --> 00:30:48,017
You don't seem fine to me.

574
00:30:49,017 --> 00:30:50,017
Ji Young.

575
00:30:50,216 --> 00:30:51,416
You weren't nervous at all...

576
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:53,216
when playing that role
in "Don't Lie."

577
00:30:53,757 --> 00:30:56,057
What is it?
Why are you this nervous?

578
00:30:56,456 --> 00:30:57,597
Tell me about it.

579
00:30:57,956 --> 00:30:59,857
I don't know why I am this way.

580
00:31:00,966 --> 00:31:04,067
It must be because
I have to play the lead.

581
00:31:04,497 --> 00:31:07,166
The whole show will tank
if I don't do a good job.

582
00:31:08,337 --> 00:31:10,706
That thought alone terrifies me,

583
00:31:10,976 --> 00:31:12,777
and I see nothing but darkness.

584
00:31:13,176 --> 00:31:14,646
It's because
you're a responsible person.

585
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:16,847
But that's never a bad thing.

586
00:31:18,017 --> 00:31:19,317
I guess, but...

587
00:31:20,847 --> 00:31:21,916
I'm a nervous wreck,

588
00:31:21,916 --> 00:31:24,317
and I don't know
if I'll be able to do a good job.

589
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:29,027
Ji Young, focus and imagine that
you're the character you're playing.

590
00:31:30,057 --> 00:31:33,027
"I am someone else.
Not Kim Ji Young."

591
00:31:33,966 --> 00:31:35,166
Say that to yourself...

592
00:31:35,166 --> 00:31:36,396
just like you did
when filming "Don't Lie."

593
00:31:36,966 --> 00:31:39,537
Got it. I'll do that.

594
00:31:40,767 --> 00:31:41,767
Baby chick.

595
00:31:42,107 --> 00:31:44,007
Sorry? A baby chick?

596
00:31:44,476 --> 00:31:45,476
What baby chick?

597
00:31:47,777 --> 00:31:50,146
There are too many people around me.

598
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:53,176
If I say "baby chick" to you,

599
00:31:53,446 --> 00:31:55,216
that's me saying "I like you."

600
00:31:56,386 --> 00:31:57,456
What?

601
00:31:58,357 --> 00:31:59,757
Goodness me.

602
00:32:03,997 --> 00:32:05,126
Got it.

603
00:32:07,567 --> 00:32:08,666
Chirp.

604
00:32:11,267 --> 00:32:13,636
- Baby chick.
- Chirp.

605
00:32:36,327 --> 00:32:39,257
How do I look?
Do I look like a city girl?

606
00:32:39,827 --> 00:32:41,626
Will it be okay
for my job interview tomorrow?

607
00:32:41,896 --> 00:32:44,497
Yes, you look like a city girl.
Very good.

608
00:32:46,366 --> 00:32:49,607
Excuse me.
I'll take everything here.

609
00:32:52,206 --> 00:32:53,976
Cut, okay. Nice job!

610
00:32:55,607 --> 00:32:59,976
How is it that the country bumpkin
is this good at putting on an act?

611
00:32:59,976 --> 00:33:02,386
She's not intimidated
despite being a rookie.

612
00:33:02,886 --> 00:33:04,087
Unbelievable.

613
00:33:06,156 --> 00:33:08,487
Mr. Lee, how was I?

614
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:09,857
Did I do all right?

615
00:33:09,857 --> 00:33:11,797
As if I need to tell you that.

616
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:14,396
Ji Young, you did great.

617
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:17,997
- There's no need to be nervous.
- Why is Jae Dong with her?

618
00:33:18,237 --> 00:33:19,797
Jae Dong, hey.

619
00:33:20,466 --> 00:33:22,636
Why were you with
that country bumpkin?

620
00:33:23,866 --> 00:33:26,176
Ms. Baek, I started
an agency of my own.

621
00:33:28,676 --> 00:33:31,277
Also, her name is Kim Ji Young,
not Country Bumpkin.

622
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:32,876
She's the first actor I signed.

623
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:35,087
Popcorn Entertainment?
Are you saying...

624
00:33:35,386 --> 00:33:38,386
that she's an actor
signed with your agency?

625
00:33:38,386 --> 00:33:39,416
Yes.

626
00:33:40,216 --> 00:33:43,156
Look at you.

627
00:33:53,067 --> 00:33:54,107
Ji Young.

628
00:33:56,837 --> 00:33:57,936
Director Ko.

629
00:33:59,777 --> 00:34:00,807
Ji Young, what's wrong?

630
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:02,906
Was there a problem on set?

631
00:34:03,906 --> 00:34:05,317
I was the problem.

632
00:34:06,317 --> 00:34:08,416
I botched my scenes many times...

633
00:34:08,686 --> 00:34:11,186
and didn't do as well
as I wanted to.

634
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:14,686
Is that why you're so glum?

635
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:16,327
Yes.

636
00:34:17,157 --> 00:34:18,556
That's how it is at first.

637
00:34:19,027 --> 00:34:20,826
Being nervous leads to errors,

638
00:34:21,067 --> 00:34:22,326
and there are actors...

639
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:24,237
who forget their lines
in front of the camera.

640
00:34:24,666 --> 00:34:26,436
An actor who only had one line...

641
00:34:26,436 --> 00:34:28,206
could not say it right for 30 takes.

642
00:34:28,206 --> 00:34:30,166
The whole day went by
without making any progress.

643
00:34:31,206 --> 00:34:33,007
That sounds like a lie.

644
00:34:34,146 --> 00:34:35,146
I bet it is.

645
00:34:35,146 --> 00:34:38,646
I'd be lying
if I didn't add some drama to it,

646
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:40,416
but that's how everyone starts out.

647
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:43,016
Thank you.

648
00:34:43,746 --> 00:34:45,857
I feel better now...

649
00:34:45,857 --> 00:34:48,686
after hearing you say that,
Director Ko.

650
00:34:50,056 --> 00:34:51,157
Ji Young,

651
00:34:51,726 --> 00:34:53,626
when will you stop addressing me
as Director Ko?

652
00:34:53,956 --> 00:34:55,396
Are we at the office?

653
00:34:55,396 --> 00:34:56,927
I thought we were dating,

654
00:34:56,927 --> 00:34:58,737
but you keep calling me Director.

655
00:34:59,496 --> 00:35:00,967
How should I call you, then?

656
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:03,467
Well,

657
00:35:04,036 --> 00:35:05,177
Sweetie would be nice.

658
00:35:05,407 --> 00:35:07,476
Wait, what?

659
00:35:08,876 --> 00:35:11,677
Gosh, I can't say
something like that.

660
00:35:11,677 --> 00:35:14,617
Besides, it's not like
we're a family or anything.

661
00:35:14,617 --> 00:35:16,146
It's not appropriate at all.

662
00:35:16,146 --> 00:35:19,117
And I've always been against
addressing a boyfriend like that.

663
00:35:19,587 --> 00:35:21,987
Will you keep calling me
Director Ko, then?

664
00:35:22,387 --> 00:35:24,257
I guess I won't, but...

665
00:35:25,596 --> 00:35:27,297
How about Mr. Ko?

666
00:35:27,967 --> 00:35:30,697
Well, that doesn't sound so bad.

667
00:35:32,266 --> 00:35:36,067
I can't say
I'm excited about it either.

668
00:35:37,007 --> 00:35:39,137
Let me think about it, then.

669
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:41,547
Meanwhile, how should I address you?

670
00:35:43,846 --> 00:35:44,846
Darling?

671
00:35:45,246 --> 00:35:46,246
What?

672
00:35:46,547 --> 00:35:48,346
- Baby?
- What?

673
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:50,087
- Honey?
- My gosh!

674
00:35:50,087 --> 00:35:53,286
Stop that already
and stick to my name.

675
00:35:53,516 --> 00:35:55,726
The goosebumps
might actually kill me.

676
00:35:55,826 --> 00:35:58,626
Okay, fine.
I can't have goosebumps kill you,

677
00:35:58,896 --> 00:36:00,556
so I'll stick to Ji Young for now.

678
00:36:01,396 --> 00:36:02,496
I'd like that.

679
00:36:02,596 --> 00:36:06,266
I love it the most
when you call me by my name.

680
00:36:07,337 --> 00:36:08,467
All right.

681
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:11,306
I prepared something to celebrate
your first day of filming,

682
00:36:11,306 --> 00:36:12,407
so let's get going for now.

683
00:36:12,806 --> 00:36:13,907
What is it?

684
00:36:13,907 --> 00:36:15,306
You'll know once you see it.

685
00:36:15,677 --> 00:36:17,876
But I'm curious.

686
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:19,876
Can't you tell me in advance?

687
00:36:23,087 --> 00:36:25,887
Director Ko, these are pretty.

688
00:36:28,027 --> 00:36:29,657
There's a treasure box somewhere,

689
00:36:29,657 --> 00:36:30,757
so try to find it.

690
00:36:31,527 --> 00:36:32,527
Sure.

691
00:36:39,467 --> 00:36:41,036
Here. I found it.

692
00:36:41,907 --> 00:36:42,936
Open it.

693
00:36:43,237 --> 00:36:44,376
Sure.

694
00:36:47,237 --> 00:36:48,246
What?

695
00:36:54,416 --> 00:36:55,846
Let it only be rainbows
and sunshine for you.

696
00:36:56,516 --> 00:36:58,757
From Ko Pil Seung,
who will always be...

697
00:36:58,757 --> 00:36:59,916
your number one fan.

698
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,357
Director Ko, my gosh.

699
00:37:06,527 --> 00:37:09,067
If anything brings you down,

700
00:37:09,067 --> 00:37:10,697
look at these and cheer up.

701
00:37:11,266 --> 00:37:14,067
Also, yell at it
when you get mad at me.

702
00:37:15,337 --> 00:37:16,867
Am I allowed to do that?

703
00:37:18,206 --> 00:37:19,507
Are you actually thinking about it?

704
00:37:22,677 --> 00:37:25,447
As if I would have a reason
to yell at you.

705
00:37:25,547 --> 00:37:27,346
I won't, Director Ko.

706
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,846
You're still calling me that.

707
00:37:29,846 --> 00:37:31,516
Fine, Pil Seung.

708
00:37:35,357 --> 00:37:36,427
What was that?

709
00:37:37,826 --> 00:37:39,357
Go ahead and address me like that.

710
00:38:06,087 --> 00:38:07,286
My gosh.

711
00:38:10,456 --> 00:38:12,797
It's my grandma. What do I do?

712
00:38:13,226 --> 00:38:14,496
Director Ko, get going.

713
00:38:14,496 --> 00:38:16,596
My grandma will have a fit
when she finds out.

714
00:38:16,596 --> 00:38:18,396
She'll beat me to a pulp.

715
00:38:19,266 --> 00:38:20,367
What did I do wrong?

716
00:38:20,367 --> 00:38:22,107
- Get going already.
- I'll see myself out.

717
00:38:22,107 --> 00:38:24,067
- Sure. Get going.
- Right.

718
00:38:30,706 --> 00:38:33,646
Gosh. Hey, Grandma.

719
00:38:34,217 --> 00:38:37,657
Did you have to call me
at that particular moment?

720
00:38:37,657 --> 00:38:41,087
I called because
I wanted to hear your voice.

721
00:38:41,726 --> 00:38:44,527
Why are you yelling at me?

722
00:38:45,826 --> 00:38:48,996
When did I yell at you?

723
00:38:48,996 --> 00:38:50,027
Ji Young,

724
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:53,867
do not date random men in Seoul,

725
00:38:53,867 --> 00:38:57,237
and do not let men into your unit.

726
00:38:57,237 --> 00:38:59,507
Keep that in mind.

727
00:38:59,507 --> 00:39:02,177
Sure thing.

728
00:39:02,547 --> 00:39:04,717
You worry like
it's a habit of yours.

729
00:39:05,016 --> 00:39:08,447
Grandma, we'll talk again soon.

730
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:18,826
Even from way over there,
she knows what's going on.

731
00:39:20,427 --> 00:39:23,596
Because of her,
I can't get anywhere in life.

732
00:39:26,766 --> 00:39:27,907
Goodness.

733
00:39:28,837 --> 00:39:32,277
What almost happened just now?

734
00:39:35,047 --> 00:39:36,177
Ji Young,

735
00:39:36,806 --> 00:39:39,516
what are you picturing?

736
00:39:58,949 --> 00:40:00,019
Pil Seung.

737
00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:02,590
I'm starting
my own production house.

738
00:40:04,059 --> 00:40:05,119
A production house?

739
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:09,329
It has been my dream for years now,

740
00:40:09,729 --> 00:40:11,530
and I'm finally
devoting myself to it.

741
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:14,570
I see.

742
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,099
Before the foundation ceremony,
I've been meeting...

743
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:19,309
with writers and directors to hire.

744
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:24,039
Can I ask for your support?

745
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:26,780
Sorry?

746
00:40:27,249 --> 00:40:30,519
I want you to be the first one...

747
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:32,889
that is signed
by GOGO Entertainment.

748
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,090
That is why I asked to meet you.

749
00:40:37,289 --> 00:40:38,360
Me?

750
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:41,329
Yes, I thoroughly enjoyed...

751
00:40:41,329 --> 00:40:43,659
your series "Don't Lie."

752
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,769
Your directing ability
is what made the show sparkle.

753
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:51,570
Your skills are even
being recognized internationally.

754
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:54,309
Pil Seung,

755
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,539
join GOGO Entertainment.

756
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,849
Ms. Jang, I appreciate the offer,

757
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:09,420
but I still lack in many ways
and need more experience.

758
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,960
Gosh, no.
You're already good enough.

759
00:41:16,429 --> 00:41:17,499
Here's the contract.

760
00:41:17,999 --> 00:41:20,769
Why don't you go ahead
and give it a read?

761
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:23,570
Tell me if there's anything else
you'd like to add.

762
00:41:38,619 --> 00:41:39,650
This...

763
00:41:40,749 --> 00:41:42,720
The signing bonus is too much.

764
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,720
Don't be ridiculous.

765
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,460
You're being offered that
because you're worth every penny.

766
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:50,699
I did my research,
and other production houses...

767
00:41:50,699 --> 00:41:53,199
are desperately trying to sign you.

768
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:54,400
Only an offer like this...

769
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,039
would get you to consider
joining us.

770
00:41:57,999 --> 00:41:59,010
Ms. Jang...

771
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:03,479
My dream is to have
GOGO Entertainment...

772
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:06,010
be Korea's best
drama production house.

773
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:08,920
If you agree to join us,

774
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,749
I will support you unsparingly...

775
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:14,220
and let you tell your own stories.

776
00:42:15,789 --> 00:42:18,289
I'm just getting started
and need someone I can rely on.

777
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:22,559
Director Ko... I mean, Pil Seung.

778
00:42:24,099 --> 00:42:25,329
I would appreciate your help.

779
00:42:31,999 --> 00:42:34,470
All right. I'll think about it.

780
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:37,840
Good.

781
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,229
My dream is to have
GOGO Entertainment...

782
00:42:52,229 --> 00:42:54,630
be Korea's best
drama production house.

783
00:42:55,329 --> 00:42:57,099
If you agree to join us,

784
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:00,400
I will support you unsparingly...

785
00:43:01,229 --> 00:43:02,670
and let you tell your own stories.

786
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,309
I can make two million dollars
after a few hours of a photo shoot.

787
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:11,010
Can you give me that money instead?

788
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:12,809
The mistake will be mine to regret,

789
00:43:12,809 --> 00:43:15,309
so shut it and get lost
unless you have two million dollars!

790
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,949
Two million dollars?

791
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:20,820
No, I don't.

792
00:43:23,389 --> 00:43:27,090
Not two million dollars,
not 200,000 dollars,

793
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:30,599
not even 20,000 dollars.

794
00:43:33,999 --> 00:43:36,499
I guess I could offer 2,000 dollars.

795
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:40,809
If I save up...

796
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,210
and scrape up everything I have,

797
00:43:46,679 --> 00:43:48,849
I'll be able to offer 2,000 dollars.

798
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:57,760
I won't waver again.

799
00:44:00,229 --> 00:44:02,199
Never again
will I lose someone I cherish...

800
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,030
just because I lack money and power.

801
00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:09,139
Never again.

802
00:44:16,179 --> 00:44:17,240
What?

803
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:20,150
You'll move to the company
Soo Yeon's starting?

804
00:44:21,449 --> 00:44:22,449
Yes.

805
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:28,720
Are you saying you'll quit
working at the TV station?

806
00:44:30,289 --> 00:44:31,320
Yes.

807
00:44:32,019 --> 00:44:33,960
Ms. Jang offered me...

808
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:35,900
a crazy deal through the company.

809
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:40,099
I don't think I'll get another shot
like it, so I'll give it a go.

810
00:44:42,099 --> 00:44:44,499
Yes, but still, Pil Seung.

811
00:44:44,499 --> 00:44:47,110
Can't you think about it
a little more cautiously?

812
00:44:48,369 --> 00:44:50,380
The moment you leave the TV station,

813
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:54,079
you'll lose all the perks
and protection they offered.

814
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:58,079
The TV station guarantees a job
until you reach retirement age,

815
00:44:58,179 --> 00:44:59,420
and the work is stable.

816
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:03,220
Even if you mess up
and your drama flops a few times,

817
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:05,220
you can get another shot.

818
00:45:06,289 --> 00:45:09,460
But if a contract-based director
messes up just one project,

819
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:12,599
it becomes much harder
to get another chance.

820
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:15,699
Yes. Think about it again.

821
00:45:16,369 --> 00:45:18,699
Wouldn't you prefer a stable job?

822
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:23,240
It will be tougher
once I leave the TV station,

823
00:45:24,309 --> 00:45:25,979
but I want to succeed on my own.

824
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:27,880
And make money.

825
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:32,220
I'll trust in myself
and give it a go.

826
00:45:32,289 --> 00:45:33,690
So don't worry too much.

827
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,159
Well, okay, then.

828
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:40,860
If you made up your mind,
then you must go with it.

829
00:45:41,559 --> 00:45:42,630
I understand.

830
00:45:43,059 --> 00:45:46,070
Since you made the decision,
do your best.

831
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:47,229
Be successful.

832
00:45:48,499 --> 00:45:52,470
Yes. She offered you
a much better pay.

833
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:54,269
- Why would you refuse?
- Yes.

834
00:45:54,309 --> 00:45:56,210
Pil Seung. Good for you.

835
00:45:56,539 --> 00:45:59,179
You must strike
while the iron is hot.

836
00:46:00,309 --> 00:46:02,820
A production house
beneath APP Group...

837
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,320
will never go belly up.

838
00:46:04,749 --> 00:46:06,349
I'm happy for you. Congratulations.

839
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,030
Okay.

840
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:17,760
I trust in you too.

841
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:21,099
Thank you.

842
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,240
Mom, Dad, Grandma, Auntie.

843
00:46:25,499 --> 00:46:26,570
What?

844
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:30,309
You'll sign Director Ko
for that amount of money?

845
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:34,809
Why would you offer
that much money to a small fry?

846
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:38,050
Are you out of your mind?

847
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:42,889
Jin Dan. How dare you
talk to my wife like that?

848
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:44,690
Are you saying she's crazy?

849
00:46:45,289 --> 00:46:46,329
I apologize.

850
00:46:47,289 --> 00:46:50,030
But Jin Taek.
This is out of the ordinary.

851
00:46:50,699 --> 00:46:53,130
If you offer that much money
to a lowly director,

852
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:55,170
it will drive up
the other directors' pay.

853
00:46:56,199 --> 00:46:57,999
Other production companies
will badmouth her.

854
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:01,210
It goes against business morals.

855
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,309
Soo Yeon.

856
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:06,449
Did you offer that much
because he's your friend's son?

857
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,280
Why would you say
it's because he's my friend's son?

858
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,019
How could you?

859
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:15,019
Director Ko isn't a small fry.

860
00:47:15,019 --> 00:47:17,389
He's one of
the hottest rising directors.

861
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,190
It's true he doesn't have
much experience,

862
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:21,829
but two years ago,

863
00:47:21,829 --> 00:47:24,329
his one-episode drama won an award
at an international drama festival.

864
00:47:24,699 --> 00:47:26,929
His current drama "Don't Lie"...

865
00:47:27,099 --> 00:47:29,139
is a candidate
for the Juniper Award.

866
00:47:29,139 --> 00:47:31,499
Even people abroad
have begun to notice him.

867
00:47:31,869 --> 00:47:34,610
Another production house
was trying to scout him,

868
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:36,909
and I barely managed to
get him interested in my offer.

869
00:47:37,309 --> 00:47:38,479
I'm still against it.

870
00:47:40,849 --> 00:47:42,820
I'm the CEO of GOGO Entertainment.

871
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,579
Why are you so involved?

872
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:45,949
Soo Yeon.

873
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:48,720
I invested
my company's money in yours...

874
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:50,690
because Jin Taek told me to.

875
00:47:51,789 --> 00:47:53,690
That gives me a right to comment.

876
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,300
You can't sign Ko Pil Seung.
I object.

877
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:00,900
Meet some other directors.

878
00:48:01,769 --> 00:48:03,800
Who are you
to talk like that to my mom?

879
00:48:06,369 --> 00:48:09,280
How much did you invest in
that you're being so meddlesome?

880
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,280
How much was it?

881
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,749
Dad, take that amount
from my shares and give it to him.

882
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:15,210
- Goodness.
- Gong Ma Ri.

883
00:48:16,249 --> 00:48:18,079
You can't talk like that
to your uncle.

884
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:21,190
Uncle.
Stay out of my mom's business...

885
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:22,789
and concentrate on your own.

886
00:48:22,789 --> 00:48:25,190
Shall I name
all your projects that flopped?

887
00:48:25,289 --> 00:48:27,229
The Myanmar condo,
the Vietnam condo,

888
00:48:27,229 --> 00:48:29,429
and Lemon Construction.
Did you think I didn't know?

889
00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:31,199
My gosh. Ma Ri.

890
00:48:31,729 --> 00:48:34,829
Ma Ri. Your uncle's saying that
because he's worried...

891
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:37,369
your mom's starting a business
in drama production,

892
00:48:37,369 --> 00:48:39,670
a field she has no experience in.

893
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:43,010
Don't worry, Great Auntie.

894
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:45,639
Pil Seung will become
a massively huge director.

895
00:48:46,349 --> 00:48:48,280
My mom will never flop.

896
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:02,760
Here. Sign right there.

897
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:04,260
Okay.

898
00:49:06,869 --> 00:49:08,630
(CEO Jang Soo Yeon,
Director Ko Pil Seung)

899
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:17,010
Director Ko. I hope things go well.

900
00:49:17,809 --> 00:49:19,749
So do I, Ms. Jang.

901
00:49:20,809 --> 00:49:22,309
Let's make this work.

902
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:24,579
Okay. I'll do my best.

903
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:35,590
What's this?

904
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:38,900
It looks like a bankbook.
Is there money in the account?

905
00:49:39,499 --> 00:49:41,900
Wait.
You got the down-payment already?

906
00:49:42,499 --> 00:49:43,570
Yes.

907
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,909
Pil Seung.
Why would you give me the money?

908
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:50,039
It's yours. You should manage it.

909
00:49:51,079 --> 00:49:54,909
Mom.
Take it and pay off the mortgage.

910
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:57,479
Dad, you wanted to start a business.

911
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,220
Pick an item you like.

912
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:02,320
Gosh, no.

913
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,320
We can't take this money.

914
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:07,329
You worked so hard
to pay the principal...

915
00:50:07,329 --> 00:50:08,960
and interest for us.

916
00:50:09,829 --> 00:50:12,360
You should keep this safe...

917
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:14,900
for when you move out
or get married.

918
00:50:15,369 --> 00:50:19,440
Sun Young. Pil Seung wants to do
his duty as a son for once.

919
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:20,909
Why would you stop him?

920
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:24,110
Thank you, Pil Seung.

921
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:26,880
You're a good boy and son.

922
00:50:27,449 --> 00:50:30,019
You handed over
a huge sum for your dad.

923
00:50:30,619 --> 00:50:31,679
Pil Seung.

924
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:34,619
It was worth raising you.

925
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:36,920
Gosh, no, Mother.

926
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:37,960
Pil Seung.

927
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:40,760
This money wasn't for free.

928
00:50:40,929 --> 00:50:43,260
You must work
to make this much for the company.

929
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:45,159
So you should manage it.

930
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:48,570
Mom. This isn't everything I got.

931
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:50,070
I put some aside.

932
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:51,840
So don't worry.

933
00:50:52,499 --> 00:50:55,210
I'm going to make much more now.

934
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:56,479
So it's fine.

935
00:50:57,340 --> 00:51:01,249
Mom and Dad
did so much for me to raise me.

936
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:03,449
Can't I give you this much?

937
00:51:08,749 --> 00:51:10,019
Pil Seung.

938
00:51:11,019 --> 00:51:12,889
Goodness...

939
00:51:13,229 --> 00:51:15,630
Yes, Pil Seung.

940
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:17,860
Thanks so much.

941
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:20,869
Good for you. Thank you.

942
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:26,070
Good boy.

943
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,599
What should I get?

944
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:02,340
Sorry.

945
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:07,010
Aren't you Myung Dong's boyfriend?

946
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,880
Oh... Sorry. I mistook you
for someone else.

947
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:12,479
I apologize.

948
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:15,550
What?

949
00:52:21,389 --> 00:52:23,360
What is this?
I felt this last time too.

950
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:33,570
Also, her name is Kim Ji Young,
not Country Bumpkin.

951
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:35,139
She's the first actor I signed.

952
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,409
Wait.

953
00:52:40,249 --> 00:52:44,150
Where did Jae Dong find
that gem of a girl?

954
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:47,920
But then I did teach him...

955
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,320
how to recognize talent
when he was Do Ra's manager.

956
00:52:53,159 --> 00:52:54,490
Do Sik, you're home?

957
00:52:55,929 --> 00:52:59,400
Mom. I saw Do Ra
while I was out making a delivery.

958
00:52:59,729 --> 00:53:01,369
What? You saw whom?

959
00:53:01,699 --> 00:53:03,099
I swear it was Do Ra.

960
00:53:03,099 --> 00:53:04,999
I chased after her
and grabbed her arm and...

961
00:53:06,610 --> 00:53:07,639
It wasn't her.

962
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:09,809
It was Director Ko's tenant girl.

963
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:13,150
My goodness.

964
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:15,079
Will you pull yourself together?

965
00:53:15,079 --> 00:53:17,820
How could you compare
that country bumpkin with my Do Ra?

966
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,590
It was really confusing.

967
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:21,889
I actually mistook her
for Do Ra before.

968
00:53:21,889 --> 00:53:23,159
This is the second time.

969
00:53:23,159 --> 00:53:26,090
I swear she felt just like Do Ra.

970
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:34,329
Mom, isn't it that
Do Ra had a twin sister...

971
00:53:34,329 --> 00:53:35,900
and you abandoned her?

972
00:53:36,999 --> 00:53:39,300
You crazy brat.
How dare you say such a thing?

973
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,539
Hey, I will never abandon
my own child...

974
00:53:41,539 --> 00:53:44,479
no matter how hard it gets.

975
00:53:44,909 --> 00:53:47,079
Then did Dad have a daughter
with someone else?

976
00:53:47,249 --> 00:53:49,150
What's wrong with you?

977
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:51,280
You're giving me a headache.
Just go and wash up.

978
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,349
Let's just eat. My gosh.

979
00:53:53,349 --> 00:53:54,720
- I know, right?
- Gosh.

980
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,590
You silly thing.

981
00:53:56,590 --> 00:53:58,690
Why do you always talk nonsense?

982
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:00,630
- Hurry and wash up.
- Okay.

983
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:02,760
Gosh, my head is killing me.

984
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:10,240
Right.

985
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:13,740
That country bumpkin
does look a little like Do Ra.

986
00:54:14,909 --> 00:54:18,380
I have this strange feeling
whenever I see her.

987
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:21,050
There are a lot of people
in the world who look similar.

988
00:54:24,679 --> 00:54:26,019
My goodness.

989
00:54:26,519 --> 00:54:29,119
If only Do Ra could come back alive.

990
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:32,420
Then we wouldn't be living
so miserably like this.

991
00:54:33,659 --> 00:54:34,960
Right, Do Ra?

992
00:54:48,139 --> 00:54:51,079
Come on. What took you so long?

993
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:53,150
I signed a contract today.
This is a great day for me.

994
00:54:53,909 --> 00:54:56,349
What do you want to do today?
Just tell me anything.

995
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:59,380
What if someone sees us?

996
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,590
We can't be doing this
in our neighborhood.

997
00:55:01,749 --> 00:55:04,320
What? I don't care
even if someone sees us.

998
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,720
We're dating now.

999
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,329
My goodness.

1000
00:55:07,329 --> 00:55:09,360
Ms. Kim and your family
are still upset...

1001
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:12,630
about what happened
between me and Mr. Gong's mother.

1002
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:14,970
They will be furious
if they see us together.

1003
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:17,869
And it will just give you and me
a hard time.

1004
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:22,570
Things will get better over time.

1005
00:55:23,409 --> 00:55:25,579
Ji Young,
just hang in there a little more.

1006
00:55:26,349 --> 00:55:28,309
Don't worry
about anything like that.

1007
00:55:28,309 --> 00:55:31,079
So what do you want to do?
Just name it,

1008
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:32,420
and we will do it.

1009
00:55:36,289 --> 00:55:37,590
Well...

1010
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:41,090
There was something...

1011
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:44,260
I wanted to do
when I got a boyfriend.

1012
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:46,130
What is it?

1013
00:55:47,869 --> 00:55:49,329
Just come with me.

1014
00:55:50,199 --> 00:55:51,400
Where are we going?

1015
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,869
You'll see when we get there.

1016
00:55:53,139 --> 00:55:55,639
Ji Young,
we should walk hand in hand.

1017
00:55:56,610 --> 00:55:57,840
My gosh.

1018
00:56:07,090 --> 00:56:10,389
(Ji Young, Pil Seung)

1019
00:56:11,389 --> 00:56:13,130
Is this what you wanted to do?

1020
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:14,860
Yes.

1021
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:17,300
This is what I wanted to do the most
with my boyfriend.

1022
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:22,670
Why? Do you not like it?

1023
00:56:23,269 --> 00:56:24,400
Do you think it's childish?

1024
00:56:25,499 --> 00:56:27,409
You just thought it was tacky,
didn't you?

1025
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:30,110
No. It's not like that.

1026
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:33,409
I like it
as long as it makes you happy.

1027
00:56:34,309 --> 00:56:35,579
Do you really mean that?

1028
00:56:36,749 --> 00:56:37,820
I do.

1029
00:56:41,949 --> 00:56:44,960
We locked up our love now.

1030
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,960
So our love will last forever...

1031
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:49,130
unless the lock comes open.

1032
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:51,229
We should never change, okay?

1033
00:56:53,269 --> 00:56:54,999
I will never change.

1034
00:56:59,769 --> 00:57:02,909
So this is the love we have.

1035
00:57:02,909 --> 00:57:06,710
(Ji Young, Pil Seung)

1036
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:48,320
(GOGO Entertainment
Foundation Ceremony)

1037
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:49,860
- Hello.
- Welcome.

1038
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:51,090
Nice to meet you.

1039
00:57:51,389 --> 00:57:52,760
Hello.

1040
00:57:53,789 --> 00:57:54,789
Auntie Dae Sook.

1041
00:57:55,190 --> 00:57:58,729
I wonder what's gotten into her
all of a sudden.

1042
00:57:58,729 --> 00:58:00,030
What is all this?

1043
00:58:00,729 --> 00:58:02,070
And I don't understand
Chairman Gong either.

1044
00:58:02,329 --> 00:58:04,699
When Jin Dan wanted
to invest in a drama,

1045
00:58:04,699 --> 00:58:06,199
he made such a fuss.

1046
00:58:06,539 --> 00:58:08,539
But he let his wife
start a production house...

1047
00:58:08,539 --> 00:58:10,280
when she had no experience
in the field.

1048
00:58:11,079 --> 00:58:13,679
I understand
Jin Taek is a henpecked husband,

1049
00:58:14,249 --> 00:58:17,050
but I have no idea
what's going on in his head.

1050
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:19,650
Obviously, she's going to blow it.

1051
00:58:20,249 --> 00:58:22,150
It won't even last a year.

1052
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,059
It's a waste of money.

1053
00:58:24,789 --> 00:58:27,130
I know. He should've given me
the money instead.

1054
00:58:29,699 --> 00:58:32,460
I'd like to thank everyone here...

1055
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:35,170
for taking the time
to come in today.

1056
00:58:36,030 --> 00:58:39,269
Though I don't have
much experience in business,

1057
00:58:39,269 --> 00:58:41,470
I've always wanted...

1058
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:44,139
to make good stories.

1059
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,610
And I didn't want
to waste more time,

1060
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:49,550
so I plucked up my courage
and started it.

1061
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:53,289
I hope
GOGO Entertainment will bring...

1062
00:58:53,289 --> 00:58:55,949
a lot of joy, hope, and pleasure...

1063
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:59,059
to many people with good stories.

1064
00:58:59,789 --> 00:59:02,460
And I will need your help
in doing so.

1065
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:05,860
Now I will try my best...

1066
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:08,530
to discover good directors,
good writers,

1067
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:10,340
and good stories.

1068
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:13,309
Thank you.

1069
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:26,550
Here's the first ever director...

1070
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:28,990
of GOGO Entertainment.

1071
00:59:28,990 --> 00:59:31,789
Director Ko Pil Seung,
would you like to say something?

1072
00:59:39,970 --> 00:59:42,670
Hello. I'm Director Ko Pil Seung.

1073
00:59:43,639 --> 00:59:47,110
I'm grateful to GOGO Entertainment
for choosing me,

1074
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:49,470
and I will return the favor
with good works.

1075
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,240
I would appreciate your help.

1076
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:55,880
I'll try hard and do well.

1077
00:59:56,249 --> 00:59:57,249
Thank you.

(GOGO Entertainment
Foundation Ceremony)

1079
01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:17,869
We appreciate all of you
who came and participated...

1080
01:00:18,499 --> 01:00:20,340
in the event today.

1081
01:00:20,970 --> 01:00:23,840
I hope GOGO Entertainment,
which is taking off today,

1082
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,449
will become a big success.

1083
01:00:27,179 --> 01:00:29,749
I'd like to propose a toast...

1084
01:00:29,749 --> 01:00:32,780
to GOGO Entertainment
that will hopefully become...

1085
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:35,389
the leader of K-content.

1086
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:41,289
To the growth of GOGO Entertainment.

1087
01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:43,329
- To GOGO Entertainment.
- To GOGO Entertainment.

1088
01:00:43,659 --> 01:00:45,329
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

1089
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,099
Sun Young.

1090
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:49,070
Thank you.

1091
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:55,769
- Hey, Pil Seung.
- Director Ko.

1092
01:00:55,769 --> 01:00:58,340
- Come on.
- Good luck with your new job.

1093
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:01,179
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

1094
01:01:01,179 --> 01:01:03,010
Pil Seung, let's drink together.

1095
01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:05,220
Sure, Ma Ri. Cheers.

1096
01:01:05,619 --> 01:01:09,050
I'm so happy
that you're working with my mom.

1097
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:11,760
I'm glad that you're happy.

1098
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:12,820
Thanks.

1099
01:01:14,090 --> 01:01:15,630
Ma Ri, what's your favorite genre?

1100
01:01:16,389 --> 01:01:17,530
Sun Young.

1101
01:01:17,530 --> 01:01:19,329
- Hello.
- Hello.

1102
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:22,229
She will soon set a date
for her wedding with Jin Dan.

1103
01:01:22,499 --> 01:01:25,400
Pil Seung should find someone nice
and get married too.

1104
01:01:25,769 --> 01:01:28,340
Sure. He will meet someone
when the time comes.

1105
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:30,710
Tell me once you set the date.

1106
01:01:31,539 --> 01:01:33,349
She looks so nice and pretty.

1107
01:01:34,249 --> 01:01:37,220
You must be happy to get
such a great daughter-in-law.

1108
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:39,780
Yes. I hope you enjoy
the rest of the day.

1109
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:41,389
- Let's go, Tae Hee.
- Please take care.

1110
01:01:45,559 --> 01:01:49,530
I wonder why her son
fell for our tenant lady...

1111
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:53,499
when he had such a pretty
and graceful girlfriend.

1112
01:01:54,199 --> 01:01:57,070
I would never understand him.

1113
01:01:57,769 --> 01:02:00,240
Stop it, Mother.
Someone might hear you.

1114
01:02:10,949 --> 01:02:11,949
Director Ko.

1115
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:14,789
I hear you're dating Ji Young.

1116
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:17,119
I just found that out.

1117
01:02:23,229 --> 01:02:24,559
How ill-mannered you are.

1118
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:26,829
You're ignoring what I said.

1119
01:02:30,039 --> 01:02:32,099
I don't think we're close enough...

1120
01:02:32,099 --> 01:02:34,309
to have a private conversation
in a place like this.

1121
01:02:34,970 --> 01:02:36,039
All right then.

1122
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:38,380
Fine.

1123
01:02:39,010 --> 01:02:41,979
You can have Ji Young.

1124
01:02:43,179 --> 01:02:44,720
I just found...

1125
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:48,090
that country bumpkin
a bit interesting and unusual.

1126
01:02:48,289 --> 01:02:50,019
So I just hung out with her
a few times.

1127
01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:53,960
And I'm not interested anymore.

1128
01:02:59,429 --> 01:03:01,329
I think you're here
with someone you will marry.

1129
01:03:02,329 --> 01:03:03,570
Don't you think...

1130
01:03:04,039 --> 01:03:06,340
you're not supposed to do this
to your fiancee?

1131
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:10,409
Are you admitting to me
that you're human trash?

1132
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,920
What? That darn punk.

1133
01:03:17,079 --> 01:03:19,720
Hey, what did you say to me?

1134
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:24,220
Hey.

(GOGO Entertainment

1136
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:32,400
You impertinent punk.

1137
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:34,369
What did you just say to me?

1138
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,840
Human trash?

1139
01:03:41,869 --> 01:03:42,869
Hey.

1140
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:45,110
Who are you throwing punches at?

1141
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:56,789
How are you not human trash
when you went...

1142
01:03:56,789 --> 01:03:58,889
after another woman
while engaged to someone else?

1143
01:03:59,289 --> 01:04:00,860
No decent man would do that.

1144
01:04:02,090 --> 01:04:04,460
Whether I date
more than one woman...

1145
01:04:04,929 --> 01:04:06,229
is none of your business.

1146
01:04:06,729 --> 01:04:08,400
I showed interest in Ji Young first.

1147
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:11,970
You're the one
who took my girl from me!

1148
01:04:20,179 --> 01:04:21,179
Darn it.

1149
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:26,949
How dare you take what's mine?

1150
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:28,749
Kim Ji Young is mine!

1152
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:38,199
Don't hit my brother.

1153
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:40,030
- Darn you.
- Pil Seung!

1154
01:04:40,030 --> 01:04:41,570
Don't hit my brother.

1155
01:04:41,570 --> 01:04:43,470
Pil Seung's my brother!

1156
01:04:46,139 --> 01:04:47,970
Stop hitting him.

1157
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:50,280
Don't!

1158
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:54,380
- That's my brother!
- Darn!

1159
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:57,479
Stop hitting him.

1160
01:04:57,550 --> 01:04:59,820
Get off him!

They say one's roots never lie.

1163
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:44,229
This is exactly why you're only seen
as the mistress' son.

1164
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:45,300
Is that the woman...

1165
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:47,369
Pil Seung and Jin Dan
were fighting over?

1166
01:05:47,369 --> 01:05:49,900
He won't change his mind
no matter how much we object.

1167
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:51,999
You didn't raise him this hard...

1168
01:05:51,999 --> 01:05:53,840
to let him marry a girl like her.

1169
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:56,940
I thought Kim Ji Young
was perfect for the role.

1170
01:05:57,179 --> 01:05:59,539
I want her to play
the second female lead.

1171
01:05:59,639 --> 01:06:01,710
I object to casting Ms. Kim.

1172
01:06:01,849 --> 01:06:04,119
I'm nervous to go on a business trip
and leave you behind.

1173
01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:05,220
Maybe I shouldn't go.

1174
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:06,679
Please don't say...

1175
01:06:06,679 --> 01:06:10,019
anything weird to Ji Young
while I'm away.

1176
