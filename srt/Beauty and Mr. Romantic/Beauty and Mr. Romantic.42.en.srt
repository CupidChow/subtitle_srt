(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:09,244 --> 00:00:11,274
(Episode 42)

3
00:00:13,344 --> 00:00:14,814
You remember everything now.

4
00:00:15,447 --> 00:00:17,146
You're back as Do Ra.

5
00:00:18,254 --> 00:00:20,654
It all came back to you
when we filmed at the vacation home.

6
00:00:21,155 --> 00:00:22,855
So why didn't you tell me?

7
00:00:23,655 --> 00:00:26,155
You should've come to me first
after regaining your memories.

8
00:00:26,155 --> 00:00:27,955
Why didn't you tell me?

9
00:00:28,025 --> 00:00:30,424
Because I felt guilty.

10
00:00:33,194 --> 00:00:34,595
I feel guilty.

11
00:00:37,005 --> 00:00:38,305
What?

12
00:00:39,635 --> 00:00:41,644
After regaining my memories,

13
00:00:42,605 --> 00:00:45,614
I could only think about
the times that I hurt you.

14
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:49,684
I betrayed you, hurt you,

15
00:00:50,085 --> 00:00:52,184
and broke your heart.

16
00:00:53,884 --> 00:00:57,625
But even though I hurt you,
rather than resenting me,

17
00:00:57,925 --> 00:01:00,125
you kept loving me.

18
00:01:01,524 --> 00:01:04,625
The guilt was too much,
and I felt ashamed.

19
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:08,405
That's why I couldn't come clean.

20
00:01:14,005 --> 00:01:15,775
I'm the one who wronged you.

21
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:19,344
I'm the one who should feel guilty.

22
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,714
I was the one
who let go of your hand.

23
00:01:23,214 --> 00:01:24,984
So why would you feel guilty?

24
00:01:26,184 --> 00:01:27,555
How stupid are you?

25
00:01:29,854 --> 00:01:32,124
You didn't let go of me.

26
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:34,994
I let go of you first.

27
00:01:35,925 --> 00:01:37,494
You know that.

28
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:39,934
After ending it with you,

29
00:01:41,934 --> 00:01:44,404
I drove a nail through your heart.

30
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:47,635
You know about the choices I made.

31
00:01:54,785 --> 00:01:56,184
I don't care.

32
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:00,214
You came back to me alive,

33
00:02:00,884 --> 00:02:02,354
so none of that matters.

34
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:05,895
And I'm the one who wronged you.

35
00:02:06,524 --> 00:02:07,925
More than you wronged me.

36
00:02:15,705 --> 00:02:17,304
Pil Seung, don't do this.

37
00:02:19,605 --> 00:02:23,375
If you do this,
you'll put yourself in harm's way.

38
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,315
Imagine what will happen
when people find out that I'm Do Ra.

39
00:02:27,774 --> 00:02:29,315
What would happen?

40
00:02:30,915 --> 00:02:33,115
That's why I didn't tell you...

41
00:02:33,115 --> 00:02:34,785
that I remembered who I was.

42
00:02:36,925 --> 00:02:38,794
If you stay by my side,

43
00:02:39,624 --> 00:02:41,524
life will only get harder for you.

44
00:02:42,964 --> 00:02:45,334
And that's not what I want.

45
00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:47,965
So please,

46
00:02:49,365 --> 00:02:50,905
let us go...

47
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:56,304
our separate ways.

48
00:02:57,904 --> 00:03:00,915
I'm saying I don't mind.

49
00:03:01,585 --> 00:03:03,014
Pil Seung.

50
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:06,584
Look at me.

51
00:03:07,615 --> 00:03:09,484
Look at me with clear eyes.

52
00:03:10,885 --> 00:03:12,954
I'm not Park Do Ra.

53
00:03:13,325 --> 00:03:15,495
I'm Kim Ji Young.

54
00:03:17,425 --> 00:03:19,764
Park Do Ra died that day,

55
00:03:21,365 --> 00:03:23,565
and what we had also ended.

56
00:03:27,735 --> 00:03:29,104
What?

57
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:32,875
So, please...

58
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:38,454
keep treating me as Kim Ji Young,
not as Park Do Ra.

59
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,024
Please do it for me.

60
00:03:59,934 --> 00:04:02,644
- You darn scumbag!
- No, Jin Dan.

61
00:04:03,504 --> 00:04:05,575
You're not supposed to punch him.

62
00:04:05,575 --> 00:04:07,375
You can't!

63
00:04:11,314 --> 00:04:13,385
I'm not supposed to punch him?

64
00:04:14,115 --> 00:04:16,084
What's the deal with him?

65
00:04:16,684 --> 00:04:18,125
This man here?

66
00:04:19,395 --> 00:04:21,764
I will marry him.
We will get married,

67
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:26,334
which means
he will be your stepfather.

68
00:04:26,565 --> 00:04:28,464
So don't, Jin Dan.

69
00:04:30,734 --> 00:04:34,074
Mom, what did you say?
You'll marry him?

70
00:04:34,844 --> 00:04:37,474
Have you lost your mind, Mom?
Have you gone completely insane?

71
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:42,214
You will marry a gigolo
who extorts money from women?

72
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:44,485
Have you seriously lost your mind,
Mom?

73
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:47,784
Hey, I'm sorry,

74
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,784
but I swear I'm not a gigolo.

75
00:04:53,154 --> 00:04:56,041
Hey, you're not a gigolo,
but you extort money from women?

76
00:04:56,065 --> 00:04:57,241
Get back here!

77
00:04:57,265 --> 00:04:58,565
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

78
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:01,094
Jin Dan! Please, Jin Dan.

79
00:05:01,664 --> 00:05:04,164
Mom, have you seriously
lost your mind?

80
00:05:04,205 --> 00:05:06,080
Sure, maybe you're going crazy,

81
00:05:06,104 --> 00:05:08,921
but you kept telling me
to date a girl from a good family.

82
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:11,051
How could you date a gigolo?

83
00:05:11,075 --> 00:05:12,945
He's not a gigolo!

84
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,485
The truth is,

85
00:05:16,114 --> 00:05:17,784
he's my first love.

86
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:21,514
What? Your first love?

87
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:25,425
My gosh!

88
00:05:27,024 --> 00:05:29,971
Mom, don't you know
my situation now?

89
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:32,294
Jin Taek and Auntie already think
I'm a joke.

90
00:05:32,294 --> 00:05:34,164
What if they find out about this?

91
00:05:34,164 --> 00:05:36,534
I'll look so stupid!

92
00:05:40,335 --> 00:05:41,875
Gosh, forget it.

93
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:44,974
Mom, do not meet him again.

94
00:05:45,015 --> 00:05:46,820
Let me make this very clear.

95
00:05:46,844 --> 00:05:48,784
Seriously, if you meet him
one more time,

96
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:52,555
I will beat him up to a pulp.
You got that?

97
00:05:53,484 --> 00:05:56,330
Gosh, you and your terrible taste
in men.

98
00:05:56,354 --> 00:05:57,654
Darn it!

99
00:05:58,794 --> 00:06:00,200
I get that he's angry,

100
00:06:00,224 --> 00:06:02,871
but how could he want
to beat up his father to a pulp?

101
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:04,295
That brat.

102
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:07,164
Anyway, what should I do now?

103
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,865
Hey.

104
00:06:11,305 --> 00:06:12,875
What's with Jin Dan?

105
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,774
What happened?

106
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:17,950
Is he having girl trouble again?

107
00:06:17,974 --> 00:06:19,514
No.

108
00:06:21,445 --> 00:06:25,555
Auntie, do you think
all he does is cause girl trouble?

109
00:06:25,854 --> 00:06:28,514
You see, everyone makes mistakes.

110
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,900
We humans are weak by nature.

111
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:33,330
What's wrong with making mistakes?
Everyone does it.

112
00:06:33,354 --> 00:06:35,294
As his family,
we should embrace and comfort him.

113
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:36,864
You always want to criticize him
like this.

114
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:38,995
No wonder
Jin Dan can't even stand tall!

115
00:06:39,835 --> 00:06:43,135
Hey, what is with you today?
What did I even do?

116
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:14,935
My gosh. If I do it today,

117
00:07:15,265 --> 00:07:16,935
I think I'll win big, for sure.

118
00:07:16,935 --> 00:07:18,834
They say
one event can transform your life.

119
00:07:19,835 --> 00:07:24,274
I just need some money.
I'm confident I can win today.

120
00:07:29,445 --> 00:07:32,954
Yes, just today. Just this once.

121
00:07:53,835 --> 00:07:58,305
I swear,
I saw her put it somewhere here.

122
00:09:10,744 --> 00:09:13,631
It is a reenactment actor
named Hwang Jeong Sik.

123
00:09:13,655 --> 00:09:15,755
He said he had been paid to do that.

124
00:09:16,984 --> 00:09:18,755
Do Ra was framed.

125
00:09:19,994 --> 00:09:22,264
She wouldn't have done such a thing.

126
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:25,294
I trust her.

127
00:09:31,435 --> 00:09:32,774
Yes.

128
00:09:34,035 --> 00:09:36,674
I will clear my name,
no matter what.

129
00:09:37,775 --> 00:09:39,975
I know I'm living
as Kim Ji Young now,

130
00:09:41,344 --> 00:09:44,115
but I will clear Park Do Ra's name.

131
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:05,975
Oh, no. You look awful.
Are you feeling sick?

132
00:10:06,075 --> 00:10:07,634
No, I'm fine.

133
00:10:07,634 --> 00:10:10,651
You look way worse
than you did last night.

134
00:10:10,675 --> 00:10:13,314
How are you going to get married
in that state?

135
00:10:13,374 --> 00:10:16,684
I'm so upset because of you.

136
00:10:17,344 --> 00:10:19,255
Ji Young, are you heading out now?

137
00:10:20,514 --> 00:10:21,914
I'll see you later.

138
00:10:21,984 --> 00:10:24,524
- All right, see you.
- Gosh, my back.

139
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:26,554
- Oh, boy.
- Who's here?

140
00:10:28,624 --> 00:10:30,095
Who is it?

141
00:10:33,894 --> 00:10:34,964
(Express Delivery)

142
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,235
Mr. Gong Jin Dan sent these for you.

143
00:10:44,205 --> 00:10:46,220
Oh, my goodness!

144
00:10:46,244 --> 00:10:48,820
This must be a designer purse!

145
00:10:48,844 --> 00:10:50,815
And he sent you flowers too!
My gosh.

146
00:10:50,815 --> 00:10:53,631
Hey, I told you.
Mr. Gong is so sweet.

147
00:10:53,655 --> 00:10:55,325
Look, there's a card too.

148
00:10:55,325 --> 00:10:57,161
Here, you should read it.

149
00:10:57,185 --> 00:10:59,925
My gosh, look at this.

150
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:03,095
How sweet! Oh, my goodness.
Let's see this.

151
00:11:04,394 --> 00:11:05,435
(To Actress Kim Ji Young)

152
00:11:05,435 --> 00:11:06,535
Put it back in!

153
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:09,064
I hope your drama, "Seoul Lady,"
becomes a big hit.

154
00:11:09,705 --> 00:11:11,935
- Forever yours,
- Gosh, put it back.

155
00:11:11,935 --> 00:11:14,105
- Gong Jin Dan.
- Seriously, stop.

156
00:11:23,085 --> 00:11:24,745
Hold on.

157
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:27,055
Ji Young must've received
the bag by now.

158
00:11:27,055 --> 00:11:28,485
Why isn't she calling?

159
00:11:30,455 --> 00:11:31,855
No way.

160
00:11:32,254 --> 00:11:34,995
She won't just take the bag
and ignore me, will she?

161
00:11:35,894 --> 00:11:38,865
Even if she's going to return it,
she should at least meet me.

162
00:11:40,195 --> 00:11:41,534
Darn it.

163
00:11:46,104 --> 00:11:47,475
Sir.

164
00:11:48,405 --> 00:11:51,304
These came for you.
Ms. Kim Ji Young sent them.

165
00:11:51,405 --> 00:11:54,115
- What?
- There's a card inside.

166
00:12:06,624 --> 00:12:09,865
Mr. Gong, don't send me
these things again.

167
00:12:10,195 --> 00:12:12,794
I have no reason
to receive such gifts from you.

168
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:15,735
I will refuse them
even if you send them again.

169
00:12:16,134 --> 00:12:18,365
She sent them right back?

170
00:12:24,405 --> 00:12:25,745
Darn it!

171
00:12:31,114 --> 00:12:32,855
Kim Ji Young, this girl...

172
00:12:33,655 --> 00:12:35,924
Does she really want
to end things with me?

173
00:12:37,484 --> 00:12:39,095
Gosh, seriously...

174
00:12:40,195 --> 00:12:41,894
Who says I'll let her do that?

175
00:12:45,795 --> 00:12:48,905
(Actors Guild)

176
00:12:49,004 --> 00:12:50,835
Hello. Oh, man.

177
00:12:53,335 --> 00:12:55,075
What was the actor's name again?

178
00:12:55,604 --> 00:12:57,105
Hwang Jeong Sik.

179
00:12:57,175 --> 00:12:58,804
- Hwang Jeong Sik?
- Yes.

180
00:13:01,275 --> 00:13:03,814
Hwang Jeong Sik, was it?

181
00:13:07,915 --> 00:13:09,325
Oh, found him.

182
00:13:10,155 --> 00:13:12,184
Here, look.

183
00:13:13,555 --> 00:13:15,195
(Name: Hwang Jeong Sik)

184
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:18,464
(Name: Hwang Jeong Sik)

185
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:23,105
- What are you going to do?
- My gosh, what...

186
00:13:24,205 --> 00:13:26,075
Let go of me!

187
00:13:28,844 --> 00:13:30,975
Are you all right?

188
00:13:33,175 --> 00:13:34,514
Yes.

189
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:37,115
I'm fine.

190
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:42,825
Was there any project
that this actor worked on recently?

191
00:13:43,025 --> 00:13:44,924
I only have his old profile.

192
00:13:45,655 --> 00:13:48,224
The actor information is updated
once a year,

193
00:13:48,224 --> 00:13:50,294
but we don't have any records here.

194
00:13:50,425 --> 00:13:52,194
I don't think he's working now.

195
00:13:54,364 --> 00:13:56,404
Why are you looking
for this actor, though?

196
00:14:00,104 --> 00:14:02,375
It's just for a personal reason.

197
00:14:04,545 --> 00:14:06,775
Can I take a picture
of his profile here?

198
00:14:06,775 --> 00:14:08,575
Sure. Go ahead.

199
00:14:16,085 --> 00:14:18,385
Thank you. I should get going.

200
00:14:19,854 --> 00:14:21,594
(Actors Guild)

201
00:14:24,195 --> 00:14:26,134
Is the president in there?

202
00:14:26,134 --> 00:14:27,894
We're supposed
to have lunch together today.

203
00:14:29,665 --> 00:14:32,075
He's not here at the moment,
but he will be back soon.

204
00:14:32,075 --> 00:14:33,404
Okay.

205
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:39,414
I think the woman who just left
was Kim Ji Young.

206
00:14:39,744 --> 00:14:41,744
She must be busy with the new drama.

207
00:14:41,744 --> 00:14:43,314
What was she doing here?

208
00:14:46,455 --> 00:14:49,124
(Name: Hwang Jeong Sik)

209
00:14:54,295 --> 00:14:57,240
The number you have dialed
is not in service.

210
00:14:57,264 --> 00:14:59,894
Please check the number,
and try again.

211
00:14:59,964 --> 00:15:03,005
The number you have dialed
is not in service.

212
00:15:03,065 --> 00:15:04,934
Please check the number and...

213
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:24,755
How did you get my number?

214
00:15:25,254 --> 00:15:26,955
Did Ae Kyo tell you?

215
00:15:27,055 --> 00:15:29,725
What? "Ae Kyo?"

216
00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:33,365
How dare you address
my mom like that?

217
00:15:34,295 --> 00:15:37,164
If you ever call
my mom like that again,

218
00:15:37,435 --> 00:15:39,335
I won't let it slide.

219
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:45,845
Jin Sang Gu.

220
00:15:47,075 --> 00:15:49,184
How much money do I need
to make you disappear?

221
00:15:52,754 --> 00:15:55,960
What are you talking about?
What money?

222
00:15:55,984 --> 00:15:58,455
I already did some digging around.

223
00:15:58,894 --> 00:16:00,194
You.

224
00:16:00,795 --> 00:16:03,094
Your business
in the Philippines failed,

225
00:16:03,094 --> 00:16:05,965
so you fled to Korea
after pulling a bunch of scams.

226
00:16:06,364 --> 00:16:08,495
That's why you approached my mom.

227
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:11,934
To swindle my naive mom
saying she was your first love.

228
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:14,975
So how much do you want?

229
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:18,674
I'll give you the money,
so tell me how much you want.

230
00:16:18,775 --> 00:16:20,874
No, I'm not seeing your mom
for money.

231
00:16:20,874 --> 00:16:22,661
I don't need money.

232
00:16:22,685 --> 00:16:24,485
I swear, Jin Dan.

233
00:16:25,244 --> 00:16:28,054
What? "Jin Dan?"

234
00:16:28,685 --> 00:16:30,184
"Jin Dan?"

235
00:16:30,624 --> 00:16:33,495
How dare you call my name, you jerk?

236
00:16:34,025 --> 00:16:36,394
So why did you go to see Jin Dan?

237
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:38,664
He's not in his right mind now.

238
00:16:41,065 --> 00:16:44,105
He called me and asked to meet up.
That's why I met him.

239
00:16:44,535 --> 00:16:47,735
I thought he probably wanted
to apologize for what he did before.

240
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:49,874
But he talked about money instead.

241
00:16:49,874 --> 00:16:51,705
He told me to take the money
and stop seeing you...

242
00:16:51,705 --> 00:16:53,514
and that I'd be in big trouble
otherwise.

243
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:57,845
He even called me names.

244
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:01,115
My own son called me a jerk.

245
00:17:01,555 --> 00:17:04,154
I just want to kill myself.

246
00:17:05,354 --> 00:17:07,595
Did Jin Dan really say that?

247
00:17:08,295 --> 00:17:09,965
Yes.

248
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,864
Ae Kyo,
can't we just tell him the truth?

249
00:17:14,864 --> 00:17:16,065
That I'm his dad.

250
00:17:16,065 --> 00:17:19,275
Sang Gu, have you lost your mind?
Are you insane?

251
00:17:19,735 --> 00:17:22,704
If Jin Dan finds out
that I'm his dad later,

252
00:17:22,704 --> 00:17:25,080
he will be devastated
and heartbroken.

253
00:17:25,104 --> 00:17:26,615
Still, we can't tell him.

254
00:17:26,775 --> 00:17:28,245
If he finds out about you,

255
00:17:28,245 --> 00:17:30,944
he will be shocked to death.

256
00:17:31,085 --> 00:17:33,231
Do you want Jin Dan
to go through a hard time?

257
00:17:33,255 --> 00:17:36,525
No, I can't let it happen.
I wish him the best.

258
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,924
Sang Gu.

259
00:17:38,285 --> 00:17:42,325
Just think that
Jin Dan isn't your son.

260
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:44,365
No, don't even think about it.

261
00:17:44,765 --> 00:17:46,434
He's not your son.

262
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:49,904
Jin Dan is Chairman Gong's son.

263
00:17:49,904 --> 00:17:51,204
Okay?

264
00:17:51,505 --> 00:17:53,734
Okay. Don't worry about it.

265
00:17:54,535 --> 00:17:57,045
Even when my son called me a jerk,

266
00:17:57,505 --> 00:17:59,204
I didn't say anything.

267
00:18:01,045 --> 00:18:03,545
I'm sorry, Sang Gu.

268
00:18:07,154 --> 00:18:09,085
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

269
00:18:14,495 --> 00:18:15,825
What?

270
00:18:15,864 --> 00:18:19,110
That's Hyun Chul's friend
from school.

271
00:18:19,134 --> 00:18:23,105
What is he doing here
with CEO Gong's mom?

272
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:25,811
What?

273
00:18:25,835 --> 00:18:27,475
What's going on between those two?

274
00:18:27,475 --> 00:18:31,575
Why are they crying so sadly
sitting together like that?

275
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,674
My goodness.

276
00:18:42,424 --> 00:18:45,930
Sun Young. Hey.

277
00:18:45,954 --> 00:18:48,354
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?

278
00:18:48,354 --> 00:18:51,164
No. My joints were starting to ache,

279
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:52,765
so I was on my way to see a doctor.

280
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:57,035
And I saw Sang Gu,
our tenant and Hyun Chul's friend,

281
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:59,674
and your friend
who is CEO Gong's mom.

282
00:18:59,674 --> 00:19:02,275
They were crying together at a cafe.

283
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:06,021
They were weeping sadly
looking at each other.

284
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:07,815
Mom, are you sure?

285
00:19:07,815 --> 00:19:09,515
Yes, I am.

286
00:19:10,285 --> 00:19:13,384
That can't be right.
I'm sure you were mistaken.

287
00:19:13,384 --> 00:19:15,660
Why would Ae Kyo meet him?

288
00:19:15,684 --> 00:19:17,624
Come on. I'm serious.

289
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:20,330
I saw it with my own eyes.

290
00:19:20,354 --> 00:19:22,725
Are you sure it was CEO Gong's mom?

291
00:19:22,725 --> 00:19:25,394
I'm telling you it was her.

292
00:19:25,394 --> 00:19:27,864
They were looking
at each other so sadly...

293
00:19:27,864 --> 00:19:28,864
at the cafe near here.

294
00:19:28,864 --> 00:19:32,605
They were shedding bitter tears
looking at each other like this.

295
00:19:33,174 --> 00:19:37,174
By the way,
Sang Gu said he met his first love.

296
00:19:38,005 --> 00:19:41,120
Maybe that was CEO Gong's mom.

297
00:19:41,144 --> 00:19:43,214
Gosh, that's impossible.

298
00:19:43,285 --> 00:19:45,914
My gosh. I'm really curious, though.

299
00:19:45,914 --> 00:19:49,555
If that's the case,
they make a really interesting couple.

300
00:19:54,954 --> 00:19:57,994
Ma Ri, don't be mad.
I'll explain everything.

301
00:19:58,525 --> 00:20:00,865
Okay. Go ahead.

302
00:20:02,404 --> 00:20:04,964
I told you about this before.

303
00:20:05,235 --> 00:20:07,234
That I don't want to see my mom.

304
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:11,605
That's why
I didn't want to tell her about you.

305
00:20:11,874 --> 00:20:15,075
I didn't want Mom to stick her nose
in our relationship.

306
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,914
Do Jun, are you serious?

307
00:20:20,555 --> 00:20:23,225
But how is it possible
that you don't want to see your mom?

308
00:20:23,225 --> 00:20:25,025
You shouldn't be like that.

309
00:20:26,755 --> 00:20:30,164
Ma Ri, you have a good mom,

310
00:20:31,225 --> 00:20:33,094
but it's not like all moms are good.

311
00:20:33,094 --> 00:20:34,565
Still, she's your mom.

312
00:20:34,565 --> 00:20:36,305
You should like her
because she's your mom.

313
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:39,164
There must be someone you hate,
right?

314
00:20:40,634 --> 00:20:42,775
If I told you
not to hate the person,

315
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:44,275
how would you feel?

316
00:20:45,045 --> 00:20:46,320
I wouldn't like it.

317
00:20:46,344 --> 00:20:47,845
I feel the same way.

318
00:20:48,475 --> 00:20:50,515
I can't like her
just because she's my mom.

319
00:20:53,854 --> 00:20:55,184
Okay.

320
00:20:55,985 --> 00:20:57,325
I understand.

321
00:20:58,525 --> 00:21:01,295
I'm not 100 percent sure,

322
00:21:01,295 --> 00:21:04,724
but I think I can understand you
a little better.

323
00:21:04,995 --> 00:21:06,894
Thank you for understanding me.

324
00:21:08,295 --> 00:21:11,734
So you're not mad at me anymore?

325
00:21:12,674 --> 00:21:13,850
No.

326
00:21:13,874 --> 00:21:17,174
Now, I know
why you were being like that.

327
00:21:17,174 --> 00:21:18,744
So I shouldn't be mad.

328
00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:21,975
Now that you're feeling better,
can I make you pollack roe pasta?

329
00:21:21,975 --> 00:21:23,385
I know you like it.

330
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:24,944
Yes. I love it.

331
00:21:24,944 --> 00:21:26,315
Wait a little.

332
00:21:37,094 --> 00:21:39,765
How is it possible that
he is on bad terms with his mom?

333
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:43,335
If he's in bad with his own mom,
that's really sad.

334
00:21:44,434 --> 00:21:46,575
I have to do something to make him
patch things up with her.

335
00:21:46,575 --> 00:21:48,875
Then Do Jun will be happy too.

336
00:21:56,818 --> 00:22:00,618
So you are my Do Jun's girlfriend?

337
00:22:00,788 --> 00:22:03,788
Yes. My name is Gong Ma Ri.

338
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:06,159
How old are you?

339
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,959
I'm 28.

340
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:10,268
You're 28?

341
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:13,499
You're older than Do Jun.

342
00:22:14,068 --> 00:22:17,308
Are you sure you're 28?
You look quite young.

343
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:20,238
My mental age is about 12 years old.

344
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:23,149
So people think
I look younger than my age.

345
00:22:24,478 --> 00:22:27,179
You have the mentality
of a 12-year-old?

346
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,749
What do you mean by that?

347
00:22:29,889 --> 00:22:31,459
When I was a little girl,

348
00:22:31,459 --> 00:22:34,194
I was heavily injured
in a car accident.

349
00:22:34,218 --> 00:22:36,629
That's why. But don't you worry.

350
00:22:36,629 --> 00:22:38,258
I know everything there is to know,

351
00:22:38,258 --> 00:22:40,959
and Do Jun doesn't mind
that I'm like this.

352
00:22:42,669 --> 00:22:45,239
Goodness. What is she saying?

353
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:50,685
Anyway, I heard you and Do Jun
weren't exactly on good terms.

354
00:22:50,709 --> 00:22:55,378
I want to be a bridge
that brings you two together.

355
00:22:55,748 --> 00:22:59,179
That's why I asked you to see me
so that we can come up with a plan.

356
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,288
You've got to be kidding me.

357
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:06,895
You. Don't date my son.

358
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:08,659
You're not the girl for him.

359
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:11,528
Why is that?

360
00:23:11,998 --> 00:23:14,999
Do Jun and I like each other.

361
00:23:17,199 --> 00:23:18,538
Look here.

362
00:23:18,639 --> 00:23:21,439
Do Jun may have quit
his studies halfway,

363
00:23:21,808 --> 00:23:24,238
but he still studied abroad.

364
00:23:24,238 --> 00:23:27,278
He will be
a world-renowned architect.

365
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:31,649
So what good would it do
to have you clinging by his side?

366
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:35,088
If you want what's best for him,

367
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:38,159
you shouldn't date him.

368
00:23:38,189 --> 00:23:40,689
Do you get what I'm saying?

369
00:23:41,558 --> 00:23:42,929
Ma'am,

370
00:23:43,328 --> 00:23:47,135
I know I lack in many ways,
but Do Jun likes who I am.

371
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:49,328
He said he'd protect me forever.

372
00:23:50,669 --> 00:23:53,439
Why should he protect you?
Who do you think you are?

373
00:23:53,498 --> 00:23:57,415
I get that you're stupid,
but you're also shameless.

374
00:23:57,439 --> 00:23:59,078
I do have a conscience.

375
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:00,979
What?

376
00:24:02,008 --> 00:24:04,709
Okay. Since you say that you do,

377
00:24:04,949 --> 00:24:06,719
channel that conscience...

378
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:09,689
and don't get in Do Jun's way.

379
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:13,358
You two should break up. Got it?

380
00:24:27,468 --> 00:24:28,838
Ma Ri,

381
00:24:29,268 --> 00:24:30,444
why are you crying?

382
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:32,578
Where did you go without telling me?

383
00:24:33,909 --> 00:24:35,348
Do Jun.

384
00:24:35,709 --> 00:24:39,778
Your mom told me
not to get in your way.

385
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:43,149
She said we weren't compatible
and that we should break up.

386
00:24:43,389 --> 00:24:44,689
What?

387
00:24:45,488 --> 00:24:48,788
Did you meet my mom?
Why would you do that?

388
00:24:49,528 --> 00:24:53,734
You didn't seem
to get along with your mom,

389
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:56,469
so I met her to help you reconcile.

390
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,238
But she said
I was shameless to date you,

391
00:24:59,238 --> 00:25:00,974
considering my condition.

392
00:25:00,998 --> 00:25:02,808
She told us to break up.

393
00:25:12,449 --> 00:25:13,848
Ma Ri.

394
00:25:14,349 --> 00:25:15,919
Why would we break up?

395
00:25:15,988 --> 00:25:17,919
I promised to always be
by your side.

396
00:25:18,718 --> 00:25:22,989
Really? Will you do that
even though your mom hates me?

397
00:25:23,659 --> 00:25:26,659
Yes, it's my choice.

398
00:25:27,228 --> 00:25:28,568
So don't cry.

399
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:30,929
Do Jun!

400
00:25:33,939 --> 00:25:36,409
It's all right. Don't cry.

401
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:42,209
Ji Young was visiting
the Actors Guild?

402
00:25:42,578 --> 00:25:44,679
Yes. I went out for a meal
with the guild's president...

403
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:46,125
for the first time in a while,

404
00:25:46,149 --> 00:25:48,649
and I saw Ms. Kim at their office.

405
00:25:51,558 --> 00:25:52,989
Why was she there?

406
00:25:53,288 --> 00:25:56,558
I found it odd as well,
so I asked an employee.

407
00:25:57,328 --> 00:26:01,175
Do you remember
that reenactment actor?

408
00:26:01,199 --> 00:26:03,899
The one who was involved
in Park Do Ra's sponsorship case.

409
00:26:04,669 --> 00:26:06,568
I believe his name
was Hwang Jeong Sik.

410
00:26:06,568 --> 00:26:09,239
Anyway, she was there
to ask about him.

411
00:26:10,909 --> 00:26:13,479
Oh, I see.

412
00:26:13,909 --> 00:26:17,679
Why would Ms. Kim be looking
into him?

413
00:26:17,778 --> 00:26:19,618
It's not like
she's a casting director.

414
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:22,318
Could she personally know him?

415
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:25,459
I don't know.

416
00:26:25,518 --> 00:26:27,959
She must have her reasons.

417
00:26:28,288 --> 00:26:29,828
Of course.

418
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:33,558
No one's heard from him
ever since that incident, right?

419
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,999
That's right. He hasn't been found.

420
00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:40,469
He probably changed his name
after moving to the Philippines.

421
00:26:41,508 --> 00:26:45,479
Right. He actively went into hiding,
so he'll be impossible to locate.

422
00:26:46,909 --> 00:26:50,608
Oh, boy.
I only feel bad for the late Do Ra.

423
00:26:50,949 --> 00:26:52,978
She died with that dirty rumor
still attached to her name.

424
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:54,778
I can only imagine her resentment.

425
00:26:55,419 --> 00:26:56,848
Darn.

426
00:27:02,659 --> 00:27:03,959
Over here.

427
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:13,169
Director, what have you found out
about Hwang Jeong Sik?

428
00:27:14,468 --> 00:27:17,939
You went to the Actors Guild alone
to ask about Hwang Jeong Sik.

429
00:27:19,409 --> 00:27:21,778
How did you know that?

430
00:27:23,179 --> 00:27:25,348
Don't you know
how close-knit this industry is?

431
00:27:25,548 --> 00:27:27,895
What if looking into Hwang...

432
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,149
reveals your identity as Do Ra?

433
00:27:30,818 --> 00:27:32,558
You could find yourself
in a predicament...

434
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:34,159
way before you get
to clear your name.

435
00:27:34,828 --> 00:27:36,358
What can I do, though?

436
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:40,199
I should at least try every option.

437
00:27:41,028 --> 00:27:43,469
I'm looking into it
and will help you,

438
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:45,239
so stay put.

439
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:49,368
I'll handle it since it involves me.

440
00:27:49,909 --> 00:27:52,378
A journalist I know
is looking into it as well,

441
00:27:53,179 --> 00:27:54,878
so trust me and be patient.

442
00:27:55,379 --> 00:27:57,778
I'm worried people will find out
that you're Do Ra...

443
00:27:57,879 --> 00:28:00,054
if you investigate this yourself.

444
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:02,919
People might get
the wrong idea and say...

445
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:04,889
that you faked your own death,
changed your face,

446
00:28:04,889 --> 00:28:06,858
and started a new career
as Kim Ji Young.

447
00:28:07,288 --> 00:28:08,889
Until Hwang Jeong Sik is found,

448
00:28:08,889 --> 00:28:10,459
and we prove
you didn't have a sponsor,

449
00:28:10,629 --> 00:28:12,759
no one can know you're Do Ra.

450
00:28:17,068 --> 00:28:18,568
All right, Pil Seung.

451
00:28:19,169 --> 00:28:21,098
I understand what you're saying.

452
00:28:26,308 --> 00:28:29,808
If we're done here, I'll get going.

453
00:28:34,149 --> 00:28:37,618
Are you leaving like that
when we took the time to meet?

454
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,419
What else are we supposed to do?

455
00:28:42,228 --> 00:28:44,929
Director, I'll see you on set.

456
00:28:49,768 --> 00:28:51,669
Gosh, it's where I had the surgery.

457
00:28:54,369 --> 00:28:55,838
What now?

458
00:28:57,238 --> 00:28:59,108
Do you think you popped a stitch?

459
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:02,149
What? Yes.

460
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:05,378
Can you help me stand?

461
00:29:07,818 --> 00:29:10,718
Pil Seung, I know you're faking it.

462
00:29:10,718 --> 00:29:12,719
I know you removed
all your stitches too.

463
00:29:12,859 --> 00:29:14,189
I also saw you...

464
00:29:14,189 --> 00:29:17,489
running around with the staff
during our lunch break.

465
00:29:21,998 --> 00:29:24,828
You're right. I was faking it.

466
00:29:25,699 --> 00:29:27,669
But I had no choice.

467
00:29:29,209 --> 00:29:31,338
There were many things
I wanted us to do...

468
00:29:31,879 --> 00:29:33,739
and many places
I wanted to visit with you...

469
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,249
once you regained your memories.

470
00:29:36,349 --> 00:29:38,749
But you've been giving me
the cold shoulder,

471
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,649
so I had no choice
but to fake the pain.

472
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:50,328
Fine.

473
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:53,598
Since we met up like this,

474
00:29:55,429 --> 00:29:58,268
tell me one thing
you've been meaning to do.

475
00:29:59,939 --> 00:30:01,469
Just one.

476
00:30:02,738 --> 00:30:03,768
Let's go.

477
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:06,038
Why are you taking my hand?

478
00:30:07,508 --> 00:30:10,548
(Young Mi Snacks)

479
00:30:15,149 --> 00:30:19,389
Was this the place
you wanted us to visit?

480
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:22,058
Yes.

481
00:30:22,689 --> 00:30:24,659
We made many memories here...

482
00:30:25,129 --> 00:30:27,759
even before I had changed my name.

483
00:30:28,728 --> 00:30:30,304
Do you remember
how I brought you here...

484
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,969
when you didn't remember anything?

485
00:30:34,909 --> 00:30:36,209
Yes.

486
00:30:37,768 --> 00:30:39,538
So you remember...

487
00:30:40,278 --> 00:30:42,578
your life as Do Ra and as Ji Young.

488
00:30:51,718 --> 00:30:53,734
I say this for your own good.

489
00:30:53,758 --> 00:30:56,889
Study hard,
and don't come home late.

490
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:58,459
Got it?

491
00:31:01,099 --> 00:31:02,304
Fine.

492
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:05,538
I get it, so stuff yourself
with this tteokbokki.

493
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:09,845
I haven't been back here
since I left 15 years ago,

494
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:11,685
but everything's still the same.

495
00:31:11,709 --> 00:31:14,409
The corner shop, the dry cleaner's,

496
00:31:14,409 --> 00:31:16,149
and even this snack bar.

497
00:31:16,849 --> 00:31:18,919
This brings back so many memories.

498
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:30,459
What's wrong?

499
00:31:35,968 --> 00:31:39,038
I think it was better
when I didn't remember anything.

500
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:41,699
Going down memory lane...

501
00:31:42,808 --> 00:31:44,169
has me in tears.

502
00:31:50,778 --> 00:31:52,419
Clearing your name?

503
00:31:54,748 --> 00:31:56,189
We'll do that together.

504
00:32:00,488 --> 00:32:01,919
So, be by my side.

505
00:32:05,899 --> 00:32:07,959
I don't want you
to ever be alone again.

506
00:32:09,328 --> 00:32:10,929
No matter what,

507
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:13,268
I'll be there for you.

508
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:16,509
So, stop running from me.

509
00:32:17,308 --> 00:32:19,139
Even if you run,

510
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:21,139
I'll always find you.

511
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:24,179
Then, I won't let you leave my side.

512
00:32:25,578 --> 00:32:26,919
Pil Seung.

513
00:32:28,218 --> 00:32:29,749
I already told you...

514
00:32:31,248 --> 00:32:33,558
that being with me
would only make life harder for you.

515
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:37,788
Have you forgotten
about everything I did to you?

516
00:32:39,429 --> 00:32:41,659
Why would someone as sweet as you...

517
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:45,939
want to be
with a nasty girl like me?

518
00:32:47,768 --> 00:32:49,669
Don't you know how I feel?

519
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:55,878
All this time, I waited
for you to regain your memories.

520
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,679
You feel guilty.

521
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:00,979
You're sorry for hurting me.

522
00:33:02,488 --> 00:33:04,489
If you actually meant that,

523
00:33:05,288 --> 00:33:06,759
you wouldn't treat me this way.

524
00:33:08,929 --> 00:33:11,065
Do you want
to break my heart even more?

525
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:12,499
Is that why you're doing this?

526
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,459
It's not like that.

527
00:33:16,099 --> 00:33:19,068
You know it's not like that.

528
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,068
Then stop pushing me away.

529
00:33:23,709 --> 00:33:25,439
Don't say anything,

530
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,209
put your faith in me,

531
00:33:27,879 --> 00:33:29,649
and stay by my side.

532
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:48,969
Do Ra.

533
00:33:52,068 --> 00:33:53,399
Hold on.

534
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:55,768
I should stop calling you that.

535
00:33:56,939 --> 00:33:59,209
But all this time,

536
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:00,778
I must've badly wanted...

537
00:34:01,508 --> 00:34:03,209
to call you that.

538
00:34:03,978 --> 00:34:05,518
I can't help myself.

539
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:10,048
Did you want to say my name
that badly?

540
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:12,389
Of course.

541
00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:14,889
After you died,

542
00:34:15,689 --> 00:34:17,328
I kept...

543
00:34:18,029 --> 00:34:19,829
calling out for you every day.

544
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:23,829
That being said,

545
00:34:24,169 --> 00:34:25,798
can I call you ten times...

546
00:34:27,268 --> 00:34:28,769
No, five times will do.

547
00:34:29,669 --> 00:34:31,409
Can I call you as Do Ra?

548
00:34:36,248 --> 00:34:37,809
Fine.

549
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,278
Call me by my name
as much as you want.

550
00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:50,028
Do Ra.

551
00:34:52,928 --> 00:34:54,259
Do Ra.

552
00:34:58,638 --> 00:34:59,969
Do Ra.

553
00:35:05,279 --> 00:35:06,978
I missed you so much.

554
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:11,208
Do Ra.

555
00:35:13,518 --> 00:35:14,878
Do Ra...

556
00:35:21,189 --> 00:35:22,559
I'm good now.

557
00:35:24,828 --> 00:35:26,829
I'm good now that you're by my side.

558
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:40,739
I heard you wrote scripts
for TV dramas.

559
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:42,248
What are some of your projects?

560
00:35:43,078 --> 00:35:44,978
None of my work has been on air,

561
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:46,719
but one of my pieces won a prize.

562
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:48,889
And now,
I'm putting together a miniseries.

563
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:51,648
Oh, I see.

564
00:35:52,018 --> 00:35:54,318
This is my first time
meeting a screenwriter.

565
00:35:54,459 --> 00:35:58,028
It's fascinating to meet one
in real life.

566
00:35:58,359 --> 00:36:01,958
How can you come up
with all those characters in your head?

567
00:36:02,228 --> 00:36:03,528
It's impressive.

568
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:07,668
You're the one
who's more impressive.

569
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:10,639
How did you become
a foreign exchange trader?

570
00:36:10,908 --> 00:36:14,878
With just a click of the mouse,
you move around millions of dollars.

571
00:36:15,078 --> 00:36:16,478
Is that true?

572
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:18,778
Yes, I guess.

573
00:36:20,118 --> 00:36:23,389
I hear screenwriters
make a lot of money.

574
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,388
I'm just getting started, so not me.

575
00:36:26,388 --> 00:36:28,588
Also, it doesn't pay
as much as you think.

576
00:36:28,828 --> 00:36:31,998
TV dramas aren't something
that you make in a factory,

577
00:36:31,998 --> 00:36:34,299
so they can't be sold continuously.

578
00:36:34,299 --> 00:36:36,128
You rarely find success.

579
00:36:36,698 --> 00:36:40,739
People don't exactly write screenplays
for the money.

580
00:36:42,038 --> 00:36:43,369
Is that so?

581
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:46,409
I heard you people earned more
than six figures.

582
00:36:46,678 --> 00:36:48,239
I guess that's not true.

583
00:36:50,478 --> 00:36:53,179
Isn't that the same
with foreign exchange traders?

584
00:36:54,018 --> 00:36:56,189
Only the 0.1 percent earn that much.

585
00:36:56,189 --> 00:36:58,389
Not everyone.

586
00:36:58,819 --> 00:37:01,219
I guess that's true, but...

587
00:37:02,658 --> 00:37:03,958
Honey!

588
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:06,528
My gosh!

589
00:37:12,799 --> 00:37:15,338
What are you doing here
when our kids are crying at home?

590
00:37:17,908 --> 00:37:20,079
Do Sik, have you lost your mind?

591
00:37:21,978 --> 00:37:23,578
Come on.
Your meal's waiting at home.

592
00:37:23,578 --> 00:37:25,009
- Come on.
- Let go of me.

593
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:27,048
- We're leaving.
- But...

594
00:37:29,448 --> 00:37:30,748
My gosh.

595
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:33,759
What on earth?

596
00:37:35,301 --> 00:37:38,077
Hey. Do Sik, what do you think
you're doing?

597
00:37:38,101 --> 00:37:40,131
I could ask you the same thing.

598
00:37:40,201 --> 00:37:42,640
How can you go on a blind date
when you have a boyfriend?

599
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:46,410
How are you my boyfriend
when I can't even say that you are?

600
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,251
Myung Dong, please.
But this is still wrong.

601
00:37:52,511 --> 00:37:54,480
I agreed to it
because my mom forced this on me.

602
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,520
He also had the same job
as the character I'm writing about,

603
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,791
so I met him
to gain some insight on his job.

604
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,990
How did you know I was here, though?

605
00:38:05,661 --> 00:38:07,061
Have you been stalking me?

606
00:38:07,061 --> 00:38:09,000
Of course not. That's not who I am.

607
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,631
I was... Right.

608
00:38:13,101 --> 00:38:16,640
I was making a delivery
when I happened to see you.

609
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:21,280
It didn't seem like
you wanted to be there.

610
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,510
Also, he wasn't that interested
in you...

611
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,281
Wait. Now, I'm annoyed.

612
00:38:25,281 --> 00:38:27,351
Who is he
not to be interested in you?

613
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,750
You saw wrong.

614
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,626
I was annoyed as is!

615
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:32,320
Myung Dong, wait.

616
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:36,161
Don't be like that.
You probably didn't have dinner,

617
00:38:36,161 --> 00:38:38,691
so come to my place
for some ramyeon.

618
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,760
What was that?

619
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,910
Why isn't anyone home?

620
00:38:57,141 --> 00:39:00,311
Oh, that? I live alone now.

621
00:39:00,311 --> 00:39:03,320
Mom and Ji Young all moved out.

622
00:39:03,851 --> 00:39:07,351
That means you can come by...

623
00:39:07,761 --> 00:39:09,620
whenever you want...

624
00:39:09,991 --> 00:39:12,961
to have ramyeon or something.

625
00:39:15,601 --> 00:39:18,800
Then, why don't we boil some water?

626
00:39:22,301 --> 00:39:23,601
Sure.

627
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,651
That reminds me.

628
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,390
Does your family know
that you're back as Do Ra?

629
00:39:40,451 --> 00:39:43,961
Only Do Jun.
Mom and Do Sik still don't know.

630
00:39:46,931 --> 00:39:49,061
Was Ms. Baek the reason...

631
00:39:50,061 --> 00:39:51,601
you suddenly moved out?

632
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:54,101
Yes.

633
00:39:55,641 --> 00:39:57,401
Once I got my memories back,

634
00:39:58,011 --> 00:39:59,870
I couldn't stand her face.

635
00:40:00,681 --> 00:40:02,211
That's why I moved out.

636
00:40:02,811 --> 00:40:04,180
But now,

637
00:40:04,811 --> 00:40:06,851
we're living together again.

638
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:11,791
Really? How so?

639
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:16,191
My grandma thinks
she's her daughter.

640
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,231
Mom has been nicer these days,

641
00:40:21,201 --> 00:40:23,030
and I felt bad for her.

642
00:40:24,701 --> 00:40:26,370
She's my mom, after all.

643
00:40:28,101 --> 00:40:29,700
Are you sure about this?

644
00:40:30,301 --> 00:40:33,510
To be honest,
it isn't easy for me to look at her.

645
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,811
But it's fine.

646
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:40,251
I'm not the same Park Do Ra.

647
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,421
I won't let her ruin my life again.

648
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,421
Gosh.

649
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,061
You've gotten stronger, Do Ra.

650
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,970
Still, don't struggle on your own
if anything happens.

651
00:40:58,101 --> 00:41:00,870
Tell me everything. Got it?

652
00:41:01,701 --> 00:41:04,611
Sure. I heard you.

653
00:41:07,011 --> 00:41:09,510
You should get going. It's late.

654
00:41:11,951 --> 00:41:13,481
All right.

655
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:20,291
Are you going
to spend the night here?

656
00:41:28,931 --> 00:41:30,231
All right.

657
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:34,370
- Come on.
- Okay.

658
00:41:39,141 --> 00:41:40,510
Good night, okay?

659
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,820
Bye.

660
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:15,611
What's going on?

661
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:17,751
Did something happen?

662
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,811
Director, haven't you seen
this article?

663
00:42:20,851 --> 00:42:22,651
Kim Ji Young is getting engaged.

664
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,050
What? What did you say?

665
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:26,790
Kim Ji Young?

666
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:30,021
That's right. Here's the article.

667
00:42:32,991 --> 00:42:33,991
(CEO Gong Jin Dan
and Actress Kim Ji Young)

668
00:42:33,991 --> 00:42:35,031
(Engaged After Dating for 1 Year)

669
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,760
Director!

670
00:42:37,061 --> 00:42:38,501
Director Ko.

671
00:42:39,371 --> 00:42:40,400
Ms. Kim.

672
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,840
I heard Ji Young
and CEO Gong were getting engaged.

673
00:42:43,971 --> 00:42:45,370
Is it true?

674
00:42:46,141 --> 00:42:48,081
No, she never said
anything like that.

675
00:42:48,311 --> 00:42:50,016
This isn't true.

676
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,351
Why would they publish it
if it weren't true?

677
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,680
My gosh. I can't believe her.

678
00:42:54,721 --> 00:42:56,796
It's a romance drama.

679
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,027
They published this article
before our premiere date.

680
00:42:59,051 --> 00:43:01,336
The viewers will have a hard time
getting absorbed in the drama.

681
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:04,206
And if she wanted to marry
into a rich family that badly,

682
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:06,561
why not wait until the drama ends
to release the article?

683
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:09,137
Why does she keep causing trouble
like this?

684
00:43:09,161 --> 00:43:12,130
Also, CEO Gong or whatever.

685
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:14,971
Why let them publish this article
when he invested in the drama?

686
00:43:14,971 --> 00:43:17,640
Is he trying to ruin our drama?
My gosh.

687
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:20,270
What's their deal?
Are they both trying to ruin our drama?

688
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:21,557
They're taking turns
to cause trouble.

689
00:43:21,581 --> 00:43:24,557
Gosh! I want to swear at them.

690
00:43:24,581 --> 00:43:26,881
No, Ji Young would never do
such a thing.

691
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:28,851
I'll check.

692
00:43:29,721 --> 00:43:31,081
My gosh.

693
00:43:32,391 --> 00:43:34,490
Seriously, what's going on?

694
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:37,090
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

695
00:43:42,101 --> 00:43:44,601
Hey, Ji Young. Good to see you.

696
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:47,970
Mr. Gong, you told them to publish
those articles, didn't you?

697
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,240
Why would I get engaged to you?

698
00:43:51,311 --> 00:43:54,910
This is my way
of officially proposing to you.

699
00:43:55,241 --> 00:43:56,780
Let's get engaged first...

700
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,911
and get married as soon as possible.

701
00:43:58,911 --> 00:44:01,351
What on earth are you talking about?

702
00:44:01,451 --> 00:44:04,081
Why would we get engaged?
Why should we get married?

703
00:44:04,181 --> 00:44:05,697
We are nothing.

704
00:44:05,721 --> 00:44:08,021
Why are you doing this,
making these unilateral decisions?

705
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:15,831
What? "Unilateral?"

706
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:18,331
We're nothing?

707
00:44:19,201 --> 00:44:21,001
We're in a relationship.

708
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,410
I want to ask you this.

709
00:44:26,311 --> 00:44:28,981
Tell me.
Why are you doing this to me?

710
00:44:29,911 --> 00:44:33,751
I took you out on a date,
and we had a great time.

711
00:44:34,051 --> 00:44:35,981
When I held your hand,

712
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,490
and even when I hugged you,
you let me.

713
00:44:40,051 --> 00:44:43,320
You invited me over to your place
and gave me that dumpling soup.

714
00:44:44,161 --> 00:44:46,160
I'm making unilateral decisions?

715
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:48,430
Like I said...

716
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,061
I told you.

717
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:56,001
Back then, I was trying
to work things out with you.

718
00:44:56,301 --> 00:44:58,870
But I realized it'd never work out,
so I told you.

719
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:00,371
It's over between us.

720
00:45:00,371 --> 00:45:02,211
And I paid you back in full.

721
00:45:02,641 --> 00:45:05,010
Why are you doing this
when there's nothing going on between us?

722
00:45:05,311 --> 00:45:07,921
Why did I break up with the daughter
of the Illyu Foods family?

723
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:10,881
I ended things with her
to marry you.

724
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:14,090
I gave up all those things
to be with you.

725
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:18,131
So if you keep being like this,
what does that make me?

726
00:45:19,531 --> 00:45:20,930
Ji Young.

727
00:45:21,201 --> 00:45:23,760
Don't look at other men, okay?

728
00:45:23,801 --> 00:45:25,370
It's considered cheating.

729
00:45:25,701 --> 00:45:27,800
Let me make this very clear to you.

730
00:45:28,471 --> 00:45:31,771
I do not want to be engaged to you,
let alone marry you.

731
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:34,410
I don't even want to see you again.

732
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,780
Take down those articles
by the end of the day,

733
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:40,550
or I'll have to take action too.

734
00:45:51,061 --> 00:45:53,660
Take action?
What is she going to do?

735
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,501
My goodness.

736
00:45:56,931 --> 00:45:58,800
Is she the Kim Ji Young I know?

737
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,271
She keeps getting on my nerves
more and more.

738
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:16,280
Hold on. This is...

739
00:46:16,781 --> 00:46:18,351
- Let's go inside, Ae Kyo.
- Wait.

740
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,496
You live here?

741
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,120
- Yes. Why?
- My gosh.

742
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:27,961
No. I can't go inside.

743
00:46:28,031 --> 00:46:31,530
You said we should hang out
at my place to avoid Jin Dan.

744
00:46:31,601 --> 00:46:32,777
Why can't you go inside?

745
00:46:32,801 --> 00:46:35,677
Sang Gu, my friend lives here too.

746
00:46:35,701 --> 00:46:37,271
Kim Sun Young.

747
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:39,016
- Really?
- Yes.

748
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,840
My gosh. What is going on?

749
00:46:41,681 --> 00:46:44,557
What if people find out
about our relationship?

750
00:46:44,581 --> 00:46:47,650
And what if they become suspicious
of Jin Dan too?

751
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:51,521
My goodness.
Who'd become suspicious of Jin Dan?

752
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:54,720
You're thinking that
because you feel guilty.

753
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:56,867
- You think so?
- Yes.

754
00:46:56,891 --> 00:46:59,691
And if your friend lives here,

755
00:47:00,031 --> 00:47:01,631
I think it's actually a good thing.

756
00:47:02,261 --> 00:47:04,376
Even if Jin Dan sees you here,

757
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,070
he'll think
you're visiting a friend.

758
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:08,541
- Oh, good point.
- Yes.

759
00:47:22,581 --> 00:47:23,881
What?

760
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:26,766
My gosh.

761
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:29,320
Isn't that CEO Gong's mother?

762
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:33,831
My goodness. Oh, boy.

763
00:47:34,701 --> 00:47:38,407
Sun Young! Hey.

764
00:47:38,431 --> 00:47:42,376
I told you I saw your friend
with the tenant the other day.

765
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,077
I wasn't mistaken.

766
00:47:44,101 --> 00:47:46,941
I'm telling you. I was right.

767
00:47:47,411 --> 00:47:49,240
What do you mean?

768
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:54,680
All right, let's eat.

769
00:47:56,281 --> 00:47:58,021
My gosh. It looks so good.

770
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:00,766
Remember? When I visited your place
back in the day,

771
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:04,421
we only cooked one packet
of ramyeon and fought over it.

772
00:48:05,061 --> 00:48:07,890
Today, we don't need to fight.
I cooked two.

773
00:48:11,531 --> 00:48:13,570
Oh, who is it?

774
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:16,416
Sang Gu, it's me.

775
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,746
Open up.

776
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:21,157
Oh, well... Why?

777
00:48:21,181 --> 00:48:24,851
I'm sorry, but can't you
just stay there and talk?

778
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:28,057
Come on, Sang Gu.
This is heavy. My arms hurt.

779
00:48:28,081 --> 00:48:30,381
Hurry up and open the door.

780
00:48:36,161 --> 00:48:37,490
Okay, hold on.

781
00:48:38,991 --> 00:48:40,860
My goodness.

782
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:43,177
Here, it's sikhye. Take this.

783
00:48:43,201 --> 00:48:44,601
Thank you.

784
00:48:44,931 --> 00:48:47,077
Sun Young, come on in
with the kimchi.

785
00:48:47,101 --> 00:48:49,441
Oh, okay.

786
00:48:49,641 --> 00:48:52,211
This new batch of green onion kimchi
is very good.

787
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:55,941
My goodness. You must eat well
especially when you live alone.

788
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:58,287
I smell ramyeon.

789
00:48:58,311 --> 00:49:00,450
Were you having ramyeon?

790
00:49:01,781 --> 00:49:04,890
Oh? Who's there?

791
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,590
Hello, it's me.

792
00:49:13,061 --> 00:49:15,831
- My gosh.
- Goodness. Who is this?

793
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,630
You're CEO Gong's mother.

794
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:20,030
My gosh. Ae Kyo.

795
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,201
Hold on, you two.
What is your relationship...

796
00:49:23,201 --> 00:49:25,541
that you're having ramyeon here
together?

797
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:28,481
My gosh, Sang Gu.

798
00:49:28,681 --> 00:49:31,081
You talked about your first love
the other day.

799
00:49:31,181 --> 00:49:34,557
Is she your first love
you were talking about?

800
00:49:34,581 --> 00:49:37,757
- No, don't get the wrong idea.
- No, she isn't.

801
00:49:37,781 --> 00:49:40,220
Sang Gu is my... No, I mean...

802
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:44,237
He's my cousin.

803
00:49:44,261 --> 00:49:47,507
That's right.
I'm her maternal cousin.

804
00:49:47,531 --> 00:49:48,930
I see.

805
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:57,441
What is this?
These clothes are all for young people.

806
00:50:00,011 --> 00:50:02,340
Oh, this is nice.

807
00:50:02,811 --> 00:50:06,211
Gosh, what's the point?
I can't even get it.

808
00:50:06,311 --> 00:50:07,950
I should know my place.

809
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:11,691
You bought a lot of things today,
Ma Ri.

810
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:15,697
Mom, Dad.
Let's go and get burgers now.

811
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:16,867
What?

812
00:50:16,891 --> 00:50:19,061
Just a burger?
That's what you want to eat?

813
00:50:19,061 --> 00:50:20,391
- Yes.
- My goodness.

814
00:50:20,391 --> 00:50:23,201
Thanks to Ma Ri,
I get to eat a burger after so long.

815
00:50:23,201 --> 00:50:24,531
- Let's go!
- All right, let's go.

816
00:50:24,531 --> 00:50:26,200
- Shall we?
- Let's go.

817
00:50:28,201 --> 00:50:29,570
Oh, my.

818
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:33,740
That couple looks very rich.
They're her parents?

819
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:37,481
Hold on.

820
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:40,510
Her father looks familiar.

821
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,581
No way.

822
00:50:52,285 --> 00:50:53,360
(Gong Jin Taek,
Chairman of APP Group)

823
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,431
It is him.

824
00:50:54,831 --> 00:50:58,030
Chairman Gong Jin Taek of APP Group.

825
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:00,831
Hold on. What does this mean?

826
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:03,677
The only daughter
of APP Group's chairman...

827
00:51:03,701 --> 00:51:05,941
His daughter who was in an accident
in the past...

828
00:51:06,911 --> 00:51:08,110
was Gong Ma Ri?

829
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:11,111
- It's pretty.
- I don't like it. Let's go.

830
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:13,681
My gosh. What's going on?

831
00:51:13,681 --> 00:51:16,150
So, Do Jun is dating the daughter
of APP Group's chairman?

832
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:18,020
Oh, my goodness.

833
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,090
They say every dog has its day.
What is going on?

834
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:22,760
My gosh. What do I do?

835
00:51:22,991 --> 00:51:25,007
There were articles about
your engagement to CEO Gong...

836
00:51:25,031 --> 00:51:27,691
when you weren't even going out
with him?

837
00:51:28,661 --> 00:51:29,960
Is that true?

838
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:32,331
Yes. That's true.

839
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:34,470
My gosh.

840
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:36,601
How is it even possible?

841
00:51:36,601 --> 00:51:38,971
Has Gong Jin Dan lost his mind?

842
00:51:38,971 --> 00:51:40,410
Is he a stalker or what?

843
00:51:41,241 --> 00:51:42,680
I did...

844
00:51:43,411 --> 00:51:45,450
go out with Mr. Gong
for a little while.

845
00:51:46,411 --> 00:51:47,950
Then we broke up,

846
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:51,890
but he didn't accept it
and spread the news.

847
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:56,260
My gosh.
How could he do such a thing?

848
00:51:57,020 --> 00:52:00,461
Ji Young, this is dating violence.

849
00:52:00,891 --> 00:52:03,261
I mean, people date and break up.

850
00:52:03,261 --> 00:52:06,070
People go through
all kinds of breakups in life.

851
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:08,316
Why wouldn't he accept the breakup?

852
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:10,070
We will have the media...

853
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:13,211
publish a correction
that says it was a false report.

854
00:52:13,871 --> 00:52:15,511
What do you think you did?

855
00:52:15,511 --> 00:52:17,981
What did you intend to do
with these false reports?

856
00:52:20,311 --> 00:52:23,450
As you can see,
it's just about my engagement.

857
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,296
What other intention would there be?

858
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,751
What? It's "just about"
your engagement?

859
00:52:27,891 --> 00:52:30,190
But you didn't discuss it
with your family.

860
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:31,960
We knew nothing about this marriage.

861
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,106
And how could you say
there was no ulterior motive?

862
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:35,960
You ignored
even the most basic procedures.

863
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,936
How could you act so rashly?

864
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,300
Chairman.

865
00:52:39,931 --> 00:52:41,401
I mean, Jin Taek.

866
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:44,640
Be honest.
You don't even care about me.

867
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:48,811
But do I have to report
everything to you...

868
00:52:48,911 --> 00:52:50,611
and ask for your approval?

869
00:52:51,181 --> 00:52:54,027
You don't even treat me
as your younger brother.

870
00:52:54,051 --> 00:52:55,981
But you want to be my older brother
for things like this?

871
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:59,550
Jin Taek. No, Chairman Gong.

872
00:52:59,951 --> 00:53:01,221
Whatever I do,

873
00:53:01,221 --> 00:53:04,461
stay out of it, okay?

874
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,381
Do Ra.

875
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:23,941
Pil Seung.

876
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:26,811
Pil Seung.

877
00:53:27,051 --> 00:53:29,050
We published a correction...

878
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:31,420
saying that
the engagement wasn't true.

879
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,490
But the articles keep
getting put down.

880
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:36,690
And we asked them to delete
the articles about my engagement,

881
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:38,930
but they just kept going viral
on social media.

882
00:53:40,061 --> 00:53:42,601
There's nothing I can do.

883
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,671
When I lost all my memories,

884
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,340
I heard
Mr. Gong and I had been engaged,

885
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:55,981
so I did try to work things out
with him for a while.

886
00:53:56,781 --> 00:53:58,250
But after I regained my memories,

887
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:00,851
I realized
the whole thing was wrong.

888
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:04,480
So right away, I paid back the money
my mom had borrowed...

889
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,390
and ended things with him.

890
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:09,890
I think I made myself clear.

891
00:54:10,261 --> 00:54:12,590
I don't know
why he's being like this.

892
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:15,061
Pil Seung.

893
00:54:15,561 --> 00:54:17,300
Everything he says...

894
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:19,631
is a lie.

895
00:54:22,371 --> 00:54:23,740
I know.

896
00:54:26,411 --> 00:54:28,370
You asked me before.

897
00:54:30,811 --> 00:54:33,510
About what happened
at the vacation home.

898
00:54:35,051 --> 00:54:36,751
During the shoot,

899
00:54:37,781 --> 00:54:41,120
you asked if I got my memories back.

900
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,861
Mr. Gong locked me...

901
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,470
in the vacation home.

902
00:54:58,311 --> 00:54:59,611
What?

903
00:55:02,241 --> 00:55:03,541
Mr. Gong...

904
00:55:05,451 --> 00:55:06,950
locked you in?

905
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:09,450
That's why I ran away.

906
00:55:10,621 --> 00:55:11,921
Back then...

907
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:15,191
and during the shoot
the other day too.

908
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:20,090
Just thinking about that time...

909
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:22,961
gives me the creeps.

910
00:55:23,661 --> 00:55:26,831
How could I possibly get engaged
to a man like him?

911
00:55:28,371 --> 00:55:29,671
Pil Seung.

912
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,811
That's not true.

913
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:35,910
You have to trust me, Pil Seung.

914
00:55:41,781 --> 00:55:43,180
I believe you.

915
00:55:44,551 --> 00:55:45,890
I do.

916
00:55:46,391 --> 00:55:49,291
So you don't have to worry.

917
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:54,930
I want to get away from him.

918
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,131
I'm so miserable around him.

919
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,570
He's already giving me a hard time,

920
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,840
so if he finds out that I'm Do Ra,

921
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:11,581
I don't even know what he will do.
It really scares me.

922
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:17,251
I didn't tell you this before,

923
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:19,820
but I think he was the one...

924
00:56:20,891 --> 00:56:22,490
who framed me for sponsorship.

925
00:56:26,061 --> 00:56:27,390
What?

926
00:56:28,931 --> 00:56:30,700
You think he was the one...

927
00:56:32,471 --> 00:56:34,101
who framed you for sponsorship?

928
00:56:36,371 --> 00:56:38,370
I don't have any evidence, though.

929
00:56:39,911 --> 00:56:42,481
I know I'm not supposed
to suspect anyone without evidence.

930
00:56:44,011 --> 00:56:46,311
But I've been racking my brain,

931
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:50,151
and there's no one else
who would do such a thing to me.

932
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:54,921
To be honest,

933
00:56:57,690 --> 00:57:00,731
I was going to leave with my grandma
after this project was over.

934
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:07,231
I didn't want to put you
and my family in trouble.

935
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:13,240
But I don't think
running away will solve anything.

936
00:57:14,971 --> 00:57:16,311
Pil Seung.

937
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:19,881
I don't want to run away anymore.

938
00:57:20,811 --> 00:57:22,751
Help me, Pil Seung.

939
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,450
Please help me.

940
00:57:33,230 --> 00:57:34,890
I promised you.

941
00:57:37,201 --> 00:57:39,001
That I would never let go
of your hand.

942
00:57:42,371 --> 00:57:43,771
Trust me.

943
00:57:45,141 --> 00:57:46,510
Only me.

944
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,760
I think he was the one...

945
00:58:04,061 --> 00:58:05,760
who framed me for sponsorship.

946
00:58:06,761 --> 00:58:08,061
Pil Seung.

947
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,561
I don't want to run away anymore.

948
00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:14,300
Help me, Pil Seung.

949
00:58:18,201 --> 00:58:19,510
Do Ra.

950
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:23,240
I'll protect you.

951
00:58:25,811 --> 00:58:28,050
I won't let you go through
the same thing again.

952
00:58:36,061 --> 00:58:37,461
Yes.

953
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:40,331
Hey, Mr. Ko.

954
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:42,501
Welcome.

955
00:58:44,431 --> 00:58:46,131
Have a seat.

956
00:58:51,641 --> 00:58:55,111
So you have something to tell me?

957
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:58,311
Yes, Chairman.

958
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:02,820
You wanted to adopt me on paper.

959
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:05,751
Is your offer still valid?

960
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:09,890
Of course.

961
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:13,530
I'm still waiting for your answer.

962
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,800
Then,

963
00:59:18,701 --> 00:59:21,131
I'd like to be your adopted son.

964
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:26,541
Are you serious?

965
00:59:27,411 --> 00:59:28,711
Yes.

966
00:59:31,781 --> 00:59:35,720
I'm glad you made up your mind.
That's great.

967
00:59:37,721 --> 00:59:39,090
I've been...

968
00:59:39,721 --> 00:59:41,390
fond of you...

969
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:44,521
for a very long time.

970
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:47,961
And at some point,

971
00:59:48,161 --> 00:59:49,631
I wished...

972
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:54,831
that you were my son.

973
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:57,840
So...

974
00:59:58,610 --> 01:00:02,581
I'm very pleased and happy
that you want to be my son.

975
01:00:05,951 --> 01:00:07,311
Thank you.

976
01:00:07,581 --> 01:00:10,851
I will gladly follow...

977
01:00:10,851 --> 01:00:12,351
your wish.

978
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:17,760
I will take good care
of your family...

979
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:21,030
so your choice will be
a good thing...

980
01:00:21,491 --> 01:00:23,930
for your family as well as mine.

981
01:00:27,701 --> 01:00:29,140
Thank you.

982
01:00:32,641 --> 01:00:34,070
Chairman.

983
01:00:35,781 --> 01:00:37,180
I have a favor to ask of you.

984
01:00:38,141 --> 01:00:40,610
Okay. Just tell me.

985
01:00:40,610 --> 01:00:42,481
I'll do anything for you.

986
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,320
Dad.

987
01:00:50,761 --> 01:00:52,061
Mom.

988
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:55,061
Grandma and Auntie.

989
01:00:56,661 --> 01:00:58,731
I met with Chairman Gong today.

990
01:00:59,301 --> 01:01:02,300
I told him I'd be his adopted son.

991
01:01:03,070 --> 01:01:04,347
- My gosh.
- What?

992
01:01:04,371 --> 01:01:05,887
- Really?
- Are you serious?

993
01:01:05,911 --> 01:01:07,640
Did you make up your mind?

994
01:01:08,110 --> 01:01:09,441
Yes, Auntie.

995
01:01:09,511 --> 01:01:13,027
All right. I'm glad you did.

996
01:01:13,051 --> 01:01:14,911
It's not something to turn down.

997
01:01:14,911 --> 01:01:16,880
There was nothing to think about.

998
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,391
My gosh.
You made a good decision, Pil Seung.

999
01:01:19,391 --> 01:01:21,151
It's a good thing.

1000
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,120
Even though I've accepted his offer,

1001
01:01:25,931 --> 01:01:28,961
how I feel about you two
will remain the same.

1002
01:01:31,661 --> 01:01:33,470
Of course, we know that.

1003
01:01:34,101 --> 01:01:35,340
We know that all too well.

1004
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:37,470
Pil Seung, don't worry about us.

1005
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:39,711
He's right, Pil Seung.

1006
01:01:40,311 --> 01:01:42,541
No matter what you decide,

1007
01:01:42,681 --> 01:01:44,910
we will trust and support you.

1008
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:48,981
It's been that way up until now,
and that will never change.

1009
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:54,220
Mom, thank you.

1010
01:01:55,121 --> 01:01:56,490
Dad,

1011
01:01:56,690 --> 01:01:58,791
Grandma, Auntie.

1012
01:01:59,290 --> 01:02:00,731
Thank you.

1013
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:05,037
This is great news.

1014
01:02:05,061 --> 01:02:06,706
I'm happy for you too.

1015
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:09,441
What on earth? What is this?

1016
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:13,211
What happened to all those articles
about our engagement?

1017
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:17,211
Who did this?

1018
01:02:19,811 --> 01:02:21,111
Could it be...

1019
01:02:22,281 --> 01:02:23,620
No way.

1020
01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:32,907
Mr. Gong, I just received a call
from the chairman's assistant.

1021
01:02:32,931 --> 01:02:35,031
Articles about your engagement
have been pulled down,

1022
01:02:35,031 --> 01:02:37,300
and they are not to surface again.

1023
01:02:37,531 --> 01:02:38,831
Darn.

1024
01:02:39,201 --> 01:02:42,470
Are you saying
that this was the chairman's doing?

1025
01:02:43,141 --> 01:02:45,271
He had all the articles taken down?

1026
01:02:46,670 --> 01:02:48,311
Why?

1027
01:02:51,011 --> 01:02:52,811
Mr. Cho, leave us.

1028
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:57,751
Those articles
are the least of your problems.

1029
01:02:57,980 --> 01:02:59,590
Ko Pil Seung, that brat,

1030
01:02:59,590 --> 01:03:01,950
told your brother
he'd accept the adoption.

1031
01:03:02,161 --> 01:03:03,490
What?

1032
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:05,620
What was that?

1033
01:03:06,590 --> 01:03:08,490
Is that true?

1034
01:03:08,661 --> 01:03:11,000
Did Ko Pil Seung agree
to the adoption?

1035
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,201
Your brother...

1036
01:03:12,201 --> 01:03:14,800
ordered Lawyer Kang
to file the paperwork.

1037
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,717
Gong Jin Dan, it's all over for you.

1038
01:03:17,741 --> 01:03:19,740
We're done for.

1039
01:03:19,770 --> 01:03:21,911
You lost your position
to that riffraff.

1040
01:03:21,911 --> 01:03:24,941
So what now?
What will you do about this?

1041
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:27,050
That means...

1042
01:03:28,011 --> 01:03:30,320
it was Ko Pil Seung who took down...

1043
01:03:30,851 --> 01:03:33,450
the articles about my engagement.

1044
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,820
Ko Pil Seung, you...

1045
01:03:37,261 --> 01:03:39,590
Jin Dan, where are you going?

1046
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:41,861
Ko Pil Seung!

1047
01:03:42,261 --> 01:03:43,731
Where's Ko Pil Seung?

1048
01:03:44,431 --> 01:03:45,970
Mr. Ko went home.

1049
01:03:50,241 --> 01:03:51,440
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

1050
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:53,510
Please leave a message
after the tone.

1051
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:55,311
What the...

1052
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:00,180
Seriously?

1053
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:05,180
That psycho.

1054
01:04:11,891 --> 01:04:13,231
Darn you...

1055
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:22,401
But if you do that first...

1056
01:04:24,641 --> 01:04:26,140
Ko Pil Seung!

1057
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:31,640
Pil Seung!

1058
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:36,927
Who do you think you are?

1059
01:04:36,951 --> 01:04:39,151
Who are you
to steal everything I have?

1060
01:04:39,551 --> 01:04:42,066
What now?
What is the meaning of this?

1061
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:43,390
Move.

1062
01:04:44,061 --> 01:04:45,361
Do Ra!

1063
01:05:02,641 --> 01:05:05,480
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1064
01:05:37,581 --> 01:05:40,887
Their son stole Jin Dan's spot
as the chairman's adopted son.

1065
01:05:40,911 --> 01:05:43,150
He's the biological brother
of our brainless Ma Ri.

1066
01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:45,081
I never pegged you as such a man.

1067
01:05:45,081 --> 01:05:46,520
I don't care
how hungry for money you are.

1068
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:47,851
How could you take advantage
of your own son?

1069
01:05:47,851 --> 01:05:48,991
The fight isn't over.

1070
01:05:48,991 --> 01:05:52,061
Find anything you can
on Ko Pil Seung to discredit him.

1071
01:05:52,061 --> 01:05:54,360
With that,
I'll have the adoption canceled.

1072
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:56,601
How was I booked for a beverage ad?

1073
01:05:56,601 --> 01:05:58,606
Tell me about it. Isn't it great?

1074
01:05:58,630 --> 01:06:00,777
You're being offered
a lot of money too.

1075
01:06:00,801 --> 01:06:04,177
When ending a relationship,
one needs time to get closure.

1076
01:06:04,201 --> 01:06:07,046
I need to be with you
while I try to move on.

1077
01:06:07,070 --> 01:06:09,516
Forcing yourself onto someone
is the definition of abuse.

1078
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:11,181
Why are you doing this
when I don't want you in my life?

1079
01:06:11,181 --> 01:06:13,157
I'll solve it all one by one,

1080
01:06:13,181 --> 01:06:15,351
so don't worry about anything.

1081
