00:00:00,104 --> 00:00:07,467
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:08,505 --> 00:00:10,964
("Don't Lie")

3
00:00:12,635 --> 00:00:15,175
Assistant Director,
I'll head home first.

4
00:00:15,301 --> 00:00:17,141
You did great work today.
See you tomorrow.

5
00:00:17,244 --> 00:00:19,275
Sure. Get home safely too.

6
00:00:20,314 --> 00:00:22,414
Where could the director be?

7
00:00:22,945 --> 00:00:25,015
Director Ko left a minute ago.

8
00:00:26,254 --> 00:00:28,324
I see. I'll get going, then.

9
00:00:28,324 --> 00:00:29,324
Sure.

10
00:00:33,754 --> 00:00:35,724
So much for carpooling.

11
00:00:35,724 --> 00:00:37,224
He left without even telling me.

12
00:00:38,294 --> 00:00:39,734
That's just rude.

13
00:00:40,535 --> 00:00:42,535
(Episode 19)

14
00:00:45,735 --> 00:00:46,775
Ji Young.

15
00:00:46,775 --> 00:00:47,775
Gosh.

16
00:00:50,105 --> 00:00:51,245
Hop in.

17
00:00:52,114 --> 00:00:54,614
He was waiting for me,
and I got mad at him for nothing.

18
00:00:55,544 --> 00:00:58,815
Gosh, it's fine. I can take the bus.

19
00:00:59,315 --> 00:01:01,154
We agreed to carpool this morning.

20
00:01:01,154 --> 00:01:03,084
That was you making a suggestion.

21
00:01:03,084 --> 00:01:05,355
Besides, I don't even know
what that is.

22
00:01:06,095 --> 00:01:09,364
Also, I can't put you out like this.

23
00:01:10,364 --> 00:01:12,334
You're not putting me out.

24
00:01:13,634 --> 00:01:15,504
Pay me half
of your monthly bus fare.

25
00:01:16,104 --> 00:01:17,705
You'll get to go home comfortably,

26
00:01:17,705 --> 00:01:18,905
and I'll save money on gas.

27
00:01:19,304 --> 00:01:21,175
Half of my monthly bus fare?

28
00:01:21,175 --> 00:01:22,944
I want to save money on gas,
that's all.

29
00:01:23,804 --> 00:01:25,175
Didn't you say I was your savior...

30
00:01:25,175 --> 00:01:27,244
for getting you a place to stay
and giving you a job?

31
00:01:27,914 --> 00:01:29,744
Do you draw the line
on me saving gas money?

32
00:01:29,845 --> 00:01:32,285
Gosh, no.

33
00:01:32,285 --> 00:01:34,724
There's no need to put it like that.

34
00:01:34,724 --> 00:01:36,425
Fine, let's go.

35
00:01:46,265 --> 00:01:49,304
Director, don't you think
you made the wrong turn?

36
00:01:50,104 --> 00:01:53,774
This isn't the way home.

37
00:01:55,274 --> 00:01:56,575
Let's have dinner first.

38
00:01:57,705 --> 00:01:58,744
Dinner?

39
00:02:00,474 --> 00:02:02,785
Just the two of us?

40
00:02:05,515 --> 00:02:07,884
You got injured
in my stead yesterday.

41
00:02:08,455 --> 00:02:10,254
You saved my life,

42
00:02:11,024 --> 00:02:12,395
and I couldn't ignore that.

43
00:02:13,295 --> 00:02:16,464
Let me treat you to dinner today
as a token of my gratitude.

44
00:02:16,695 --> 00:02:20,494
But you fully stocked
my fridge yesterday.

45
00:02:20,564 --> 00:02:22,334
That was more than enough.

46
00:02:22,834 --> 00:02:25,605
That doesn't seem nearly enough
on my part.

47
00:02:26,374 --> 00:02:28,244
I want to treat you
to something delicious.

48
00:02:29,145 --> 00:02:30,175
Gosh.

49
00:02:30,575 --> 00:02:34,015
If I save your life twice,
you might end up...

50
00:02:34,015 --> 00:02:35,784
spending all your money on me.

51
00:02:36,744 --> 00:02:39,415
Still, I'm fine.

52
00:02:39,614 --> 00:02:41,985
It wasn't a big deal,
and now you're embarrassing me.

53
00:02:42,284 --> 00:02:44,624
One should repay another
when grateful.

54
00:02:45,355 --> 00:02:47,295
Don't make me out
to be a selfish brat.

55
00:02:47,295 --> 00:02:48,295
Well...

56
00:02:48,795 --> 00:02:51,464
If that's how you feel about it,

57
00:02:52,665 --> 00:02:53,695
fine.

58
00:02:55,464 --> 00:02:58,934
To what extent is he going
to wine and dine me today?

59
00:03:12,314 --> 00:03:13,314
How's the food?

60
00:03:13,314 --> 00:03:14,314
It's the bomb!

61
00:03:15,325 --> 00:03:16,385
Goodness.

62
00:03:17,054 --> 00:03:20,425
It means the food tastes very good.

63
00:03:22,395 --> 00:03:24,795
How is the food here so tasty?

64
00:03:25,165 --> 00:03:28,334
The meat melts
as soon as it enters my mouth.

65
00:03:28,635 --> 00:03:30,304
It's just awesome.

66
00:03:31,165 --> 00:03:34,175
It's the best cut of meat
I ever had.

67
00:03:36,605 --> 00:03:39,045
Here, Ji Young. Have some more.

68
00:03:39,374 --> 00:03:40,515
Gosh, no.

69
00:03:41,244 --> 00:03:43,045
I can't. It's your...

70
00:03:43,045 --> 00:03:44,244
No, it's fine.

71
00:03:45,955 --> 00:03:46,985
Okay, then.

72
00:03:48,054 --> 00:03:51,755
Why do they keep bringing us stuff?

73
00:03:52,955 --> 00:03:56,295
Earlier, we got octopus salad
which they called an appetizer.

74
00:03:56,564 --> 00:03:58,364
Then we got crab meat soup,

75
00:03:58,364 --> 00:04:00,235
then fish, and then steak.

76
00:04:01,564 --> 00:04:03,635
Is there more to come?

77
00:04:05,334 --> 00:04:07,135
- There will be dessert.
- What?

78
00:04:08,505 --> 00:04:09,844
There's more?

79
00:04:11,205 --> 00:04:13,274
Yes. I ordered ice cream.

80
00:04:13,575 --> 00:04:14,844
You love ice cream, don't you?

81
00:04:15,645 --> 00:04:17,844
How do you know I love ice cream?

82
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,355
Well, usually,

83
00:04:21,925 --> 00:04:23,554
women like ice cream.

84
00:04:24,484 --> 00:04:25,625
That's right.

85
00:04:26,055 --> 00:04:28,325
I like ice cream a lot.

86
00:04:42,445 --> 00:04:44,774
Ji Young.
I want to ask you something.

87
00:04:45,015 --> 00:04:46,914
Sure. Ask away.

88
00:04:47,575 --> 00:04:50,245
Yesterday,
I visited your grandmother.

89
00:04:50,414 --> 00:04:53,755
Yes. She called to tell me about it.

90
00:04:54,484 --> 00:04:56,455
Are we going to film there again?

91
00:04:56,625 --> 00:05:00,325
No. I went by in case we had to
shoot another seaside scene,

92
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:01,495
but we cut it from the script.

93
00:05:01,724 --> 00:05:02,825
I see.

94
00:05:03,765 --> 00:05:06,594
What do you want to ask me about?

95
00:05:09,334 --> 00:05:10,435
I hear...

96
00:05:11,334 --> 00:05:13,234
you don't remember your life
before your accident.

97
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,745
My grandma told you that too?

98
00:05:18,044 --> 00:05:20,044
She told me not to tell anyone.

99
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,284
It's okay. I won't tell anyone.

100
00:05:22,685 --> 00:05:25,584
Okay. Thank you.

101
00:05:28,325 --> 00:05:29,354
Do you really...

102
00:05:31,354 --> 00:05:32,594
remember nothing at all?

103
00:05:36,695 --> 00:05:37,695
No.

104
00:05:39,094 --> 00:05:40,094
Don't you...

105
00:05:41,495 --> 00:05:42,964
want your memories back?

106
00:05:46,974 --> 00:05:49,075
Of course, I want them back.

107
00:05:50,274 --> 00:05:52,315
I told Grandma I was fine...

108
00:05:52,544 --> 00:05:54,515
because I didn't want her to worry.

109
00:05:55,914 --> 00:05:58,555
But to be honest,
I really want to recover my memory.

110
00:05:59,854 --> 00:06:02,224
When I woke up after the surgery,

111
00:06:02,224 --> 00:06:03,885
I didn't know who I was.

112
00:06:04,185 --> 00:06:06,625
I didn't even recognize
my own grandma.

113
00:06:07,854 --> 00:06:09,195
It's so terribly scary...

114
00:06:09,724 --> 00:06:12,635
when you don't remember anything.

115
00:06:13,234 --> 00:06:15,135
You'll never know the feeling.

116
00:06:16,734 --> 00:06:18,305
It's like standing on your own...

117
00:06:19,234 --> 00:06:21,034
surrounded by darkness.

118
00:06:24,145 --> 00:06:25,174
But...

119
00:06:26,245 --> 00:06:28,315
the memories could cause you pain.

120
00:06:30,544 --> 00:06:32,185
The misfortunes, the upsets.

121
00:06:33,284 --> 00:06:34,584
They might all come back.

122
00:06:36,555 --> 00:06:38,524
It could weigh you down.

123
00:06:40,224 --> 00:06:41,495
Do you still want them back
despite that?

124
00:06:42,424 --> 00:06:43,865
Not knowing your past...

125
00:06:44,964 --> 00:06:46,195
could be better for you.

126
00:06:49,935 --> 00:06:52,305
No matter how painful
the memories are,

127
00:06:53,005 --> 00:06:54,734
they are a part of me.

128
00:06:56,245 --> 00:06:57,474
They form my life...

129
00:06:58,575 --> 00:07:00,214
and show the path I've been on.

130
00:07:03,484 --> 00:07:06,354
Right now, it feels like
I'm living half a life.

131
00:07:07,854 --> 00:07:09,385
I need to get my memories back...

132
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:11,695
if I'm to live as myself as a whole.

133
00:07:22,435 --> 00:07:23,635
You love flowers, right?

134
00:07:24,205 --> 00:07:25,334
Let me get you some.

135
00:07:26,234 --> 00:07:29,474
Gosh, no. Why buy me flowers too?

136
00:07:29,904 --> 00:07:31,305
Give me all you have.

137
00:07:31,674 --> 00:07:32,974
- All of them?
- Yes.

138
00:07:34,344 --> 00:07:36,484
No, it's fine.

139
00:07:39,615 --> 00:07:40,984
- I really...
- How much are they?

140
00:07:51,265 --> 00:07:52,365
Director Ko.

141
00:07:52,695 --> 00:07:54,065
Your company...

142
00:07:54,935 --> 00:07:56,604
makes the drive to work fun.

143
00:07:57,005 --> 00:07:59,305
Are you okay, Ji Young?
Were you hurt?

144
00:08:00,474 --> 00:08:01,575
What is all that?

145
00:08:03,044 --> 00:08:04,044
Is it...

146
00:08:10,044 --> 00:08:11,084
Go on inside.

147
00:08:11,515 --> 00:08:12,555
Okay.

148
00:08:26,495 --> 00:08:28,265
Director Ko.
I have something to say.

149
00:08:28,935 --> 00:08:29,935
Something to say?

150
00:08:29,935 --> 00:08:31,805
Why are you being so nice to me?

151
00:08:34,075 --> 00:08:35,075
Well...

152
00:08:36,404 --> 00:08:38,245
- That's...
- You shouldn't be this nice...

153
00:08:38,245 --> 00:08:39,615
to any woman.

154
00:08:40,215 --> 00:08:43,215
Are you this sweet and nice
to other women?

155
00:08:44,444 --> 00:08:45,554
What do you mean?

156
00:08:45,554 --> 00:08:47,755
You gave me rides, talked about...

157
00:08:47,755 --> 00:08:49,085
carpooling and whatnot,

158
00:08:49,184 --> 00:08:52,554
then took me to a nice restaurant
and bought me an expensive steak.

159
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,424
And then there's this.
You even got me flowers.

160
00:08:58,265 --> 00:09:00,194
I could get the wrong idea.

161
00:09:01,595 --> 00:09:04,064
These kinds of actions
you do for women.

162
00:09:04,064 --> 00:09:06,005
This is extremely dangerous.

163
00:09:06,735 --> 00:09:07,934
It's... What's that called?

164
00:09:08,304 --> 00:09:10,674
You're flirting with me.

165
00:09:11,674 --> 00:09:13,515
If you do this...

166
00:09:15,885 --> 00:09:18,554
I could mistakenly think that...

167
00:09:20,115 --> 00:09:21,615
you like me.

168
00:09:23,654 --> 00:09:26,355
I see. I apologize.

169
00:09:28,524 --> 00:09:30,064
I thought the flowers were pretty.

170
00:09:30,765 --> 00:09:33,995
And I wanted to thank you
for saving me.

171
00:09:45,044 --> 00:09:47,544
Next time,

172
00:09:48,885 --> 00:09:50,085
if you're grateful,

173
00:09:50,944 --> 00:09:53,314
buy something like
a whole watermelon,

174
00:09:53,314 --> 00:09:54,755
say thanks, and end it there.

175
00:10:04,865 --> 00:10:06,365
The flowers did nothing wrong.

176
00:10:07,335 --> 00:10:08,365
Give them to me.

177
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:13,005
You bought them for me,
so I'll take them home.

178
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,674
Thanks anyway.

179
00:10:25,615 --> 00:10:27,284
Let me summarize what you said.

180
00:10:27,284 --> 00:10:30,554
A man hurt the woman he loved
in a terrible way...

181
00:10:30,554 --> 00:10:32,755
and did something
he could never be forgiven for.

182
00:10:33,054 --> 00:10:34,095
And the woman died.

183
00:10:34,755 --> 00:10:37,225
But the woman
they thought had died reappeared,

184
00:10:37,225 --> 00:10:38,424
but with no memory of her past,

185
00:10:38,524 --> 00:10:41,395
and the man grew to like her again?

186
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:43,434
Yes.

187
00:10:44,605 --> 00:10:46,434
Is that the plot of a new drama?

188
00:10:46,635 --> 00:10:48,674
I like it. Keep going.

189
00:10:50,404 --> 00:10:53,245
If that woman
were to recover her memories...

190
00:10:54,414 --> 00:10:56,845
and realize the same man loves her,

191
00:10:58,015 --> 00:10:59,015
how would she feel?

192
00:11:00,615 --> 00:11:03,154
He hurt her and did something
he could never be forgiven for,

193
00:11:03,485 --> 00:11:05,924
and then lurked around her
because she didn't remember him?

194
00:11:06,755 --> 00:11:08,255
She'd want to kill him.

195
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,625
She'd crush him for toying with her.

196
00:11:11,564 --> 00:11:13,365
Is the drama about revenge?

197
00:11:15,095 --> 00:11:16,105
I guess?

198
00:11:17,465 --> 00:11:18,534
Then...

199
00:11:19,034 --> 00:11:21,235
how should the guy treat her?

200
00:11:22,605 --> 00:11:24,204
If the theme isn't revenge,

201
00:11:24,605 --> 00:11:26,245
they can get back together...

202
00:11:26,245 --> 00:11:29,115
if her memories return
and she forgives him.

203
00:11:29,615 --> 00:11:31,745
Until she forgives the guy,

204
00:11:31,745 --> 00:11:33,314
he has no right to love her.

205
00:11:37,024 --> 00:11:38,054
Right.

206
00:11:39,395 --> 00:11:40,625
He has no right to love her.

207
00:11:42,495 --> 00:11:45,564
The drama title.
How does "The Right to Love" sound?

208
00:11:46,995 --> 00:11:49,534
Why does my heart ache?

209
00:11:50,235 --> 00:11:52,605
Ko Pil Seung.
If you turn that into a drama,

210
00:11:52,605 --> 00:11:54,005
cast me as the male lead.

211
00:11:55,804 --> 00:11:57,444
It's okay if her memories return...

212
00:11:58,505 --> 00:11:59,914
and she hates me.

213
00:12:01,414 --> 00:12:02,814
But if her memories return,

214
00:12:04,985 --> 00:12:06,284
she might get hurt again.

215
00:12:08,824 --> 00:12:11,324
I'm worried to death
that she'll suffer again.

216
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,554
But she wants to
recover her memories.

217
00:12:17,064 --> 00:12:19,395
She'll only regret it
if that happens.

218
00:12:21,294 --> 00:12:23,164
She's happier now
without the memories.

219
00:12:25,235 --> 00:12:26,235
Pil Seung.

220
00:12:27,074 --> 00:12:28,845
You're the one who thinks...

221
00:12:28,845 --> 00:12:32,174
she'll get hurt and suffer
if she recovers her memories.

222
00:12:34,444 --> 00:12:36,745
She said she wants to find herself.

223
00:12:37,515 --> 00:12:40,015
Even if the memories cause her pain,

224
00:12:40,654 --> 00:12:43,424
that's for her to handle.
The decision isn't yours to make.

225
00:12:44,755 --> 00:12:47,225
If you truly love that woman,

226
00:12:47,824 --> 00:12:49,694
you should help her
get what she wants.

227
00:12:51,164 --> 00:12:52,335
Isn't that love?

228
00:12:52,635 --> 00:12:54,595
Doing what the other person wants.

229
00:12:57,664 --> 00:13:00,375
Was that story not a drama plot?

230
00:13:01,335 --> 00:13:02,375
Was it your story?

231
00:13:09,184 --> 00:13:11,215
(We support actor Cha Bong Soo.)

232
00:13:11,284 --> 00:13:13,215
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

233
00:13:13,784 --> 00:13:14,985
- Enjoy yourselves.
- Thank you.

234
00:13:14,985 --> 00:13:16,255
- Be sure to post about it.
- Okay.

235
00:13:16,424 --> 00:13:17,554
I'll take one with Bi Bi.

236
00:13:17,554 --> 00:13:18,755
- All right.
- Bi Bi, make a V sign.

237
00:13:21,225 --> 00:13:22,324
- Actor Cha.
- Hey.

238
00:13:22,324 --> 00:13:24,694
Jin Dan, come on.

239
00:13:24,694 --> 00:13:25,835
You didn't have to do this.

240
00:13:25,835 --> 00:13:28,335
You send me a coffee truck
every time.

241
00:13:28,335 --> 00:13:30,904
I just wanted to boost your morale.

242
00:13:30,904 --> 00:13:32,835
After the lame fight
we'd had that day,

243
00:13:32,835 --> 00:13:34,105
we became sworn brothers.

244
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,505
I had to do something for you.

245
00:13:35,745 --> 00:13:37,174
Bi Bi, let me introduce him.

246
00:13:37,174 --> 00:13:38,914
- This is CEO Gong.
- Hello.

247
00:13:39,015 --> 00:13:41,074
- It's tough, isn't it?
- Not really.

248
00:13:41,414 --> 00:13:42,684
Director Ko must be here somewhere.

249
00:13:42,684 --> 00:13:44,544
Director Ko, come here.

250
00:13:44,544 --> 00:13:45,715
Come and say hello.

251
00:13:48,115 --> 00:13:49,184
That's Director Ko.

252
00:13:50,524 --> 00:13:51,625
Hello.

253
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,554
Thank you
for your continued support.

254
00:13:54,294 --> 00:13:56,694
Hey, it's been a long time.

255
00:13:56,924 --> 00:13:58,865
So you're not
an assistant director anymore.

256
00:13:58,865 --> 00:14:00,194
You're the main director now, right?

257
00:14:00,835 --> 00:14:03,465
Director Ko, I hope
your new project will be successful.

258
00:14:03,465 --> 00:14:04,765
"Don't Lie."

259
00:14:04,765 --> 00:14:07,505
The title is so catchy.
I have a good feeling.

260
00:14:07,505 --> 00:14:08,505
Director Ko.

261
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,544
Thank you. I have a lot to work on,
so I should get going.

262
00:14:11,544 --> 00:14:12,544
All right.

263
00:14:13,274 --> 00:14:15,115
Mr. Cha, let's begin the shoot.

264
00:14:15,215 --> 00:14:16,585
- Me?
- Shall we go?

265
00:14:16,585 --> 00:14:17,715
Darn it.

266
00:14:17,715 --> 00:14:20,314
I'm so sorry, Jin Dan.

267
00:14:20,314 --> 00:14:22,284
You should go. Don't mind me.

268
00:14:22,755 --> 00:14:24,324
I'll just take a look around
before I leave.

269
00:14:24,485 --> 00:14:26,294
Call me when you're off.
Let's go for a drink.

270
00:14:26,294 --> 00:14:27,755
Sounds great. Okay.

271
00:14:27,755 --> 00:14:29,465
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

272
00:14:29,465 --> 00:14:30,895
Let's go.

273
00:14:38,434 --> 00:14:39,475
My gosh.

274
00:14:40,204 --> 00:14:43,204
Oh, dear. My goodness.

275
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:47,544
This is horrible. I'm so sorry.

276
00:14:48,544 --> 00:14:52,015
What do I do? You've got
coffee stains on your clothes.

277
00:14:56,684 --> 00:14:57,684
Watch out.

278
00:14:58,924 --> 00:15:00,024
Are you all right?

279
00:15:01,294 --> 00:15:02,694
Oh, no.

280
00:15:04,924 --> 00:15:06,064
Move over.

281
00:15:06,395 --> 00:15:07,595
How dare you touch me?

282
00:15:07,635 --> 00:15:10,465
I didn't mean to touch you.

283
00:15:10,465 --> 00:15:14,174
I was just trying
to wipe the stains off.

284
00:15:14,174 --> 00:15:17,105
I'm sorry.
Please don't get me wrong.

285
00:15:17,145 --> 00:15:18,204
What's wrong?

286
00:15:19,774 --> 00:15:21,414
Director Ko, the thing is,

287
00:15:21,814 --> 00:15:24,115
I didn't see him standing here...

288
00:15:24,115 --> 00:15:26,784
and spilled coffee on these clothes.

289
00:15:27,085 --> 00:15:29,284
I'm sorry, Mr. Gong.
Let me pay to get it cleaned.

290
00:15:29,284 --> 00:15:32,324
Gosh, no. It was my mistake.

291
00:15:32,324 --> 00:15:33,625
Please let me take care of it.

292
00:15:33,824 --> 00:15:35,794
How much do I owe you?

293
00:15:38,024 --> 00:15:39,095
Forget it.

294
00:15:39,895 --> 00:15:42,235
It's no problem.
You should get back to work.

295
00:15:42,605 --> 00:15:43,704
I'm leaving now.

296
00:15:50,044 --> 00:15:51,704
What do I do?

297
00:15:51,704 --> 00:15:54,074
The suit looks expensive.

298
00:15:54,174 --> 00:15:56,814
Mr. Gong says it's okay,
so you don't need to worry.

299
00:15:57,245 --> 00:15:58,544
It's not like you did it on purpose.

300
00:16:01,015 --> 00:16:02,225
By the way,

301
00:16:03,154 --> 00:16:04,524
didn't he say anything else?

302
00:16:05,654 --> 00:16:08,255
Like what?
He didn't say anything special.

303
00:16:09,765 --> 00:16:10,865
It's all right then.

304
00:16:10,965 --> 00:16:12,995
Director Ko, it's all set.

305
00:16:13,434 --> 00:16:14,735
Get back to your business then.

306
00:16:14,735 --> 00:16:15,804
Okay.

307
00:16:18,204 --> 00:16:20,804
What does it mean
it's all right then?

308
00:16:26,015 --> 00:16:27,145
That was strange.

309
00:16:28,515 --> 00:16:30,585
Why did that hillbilly
look like Do Ra?

310
00:16:32,184 --> 00:16:33,615
And why is my heart racing?

311
00:16:35,115 --> 00:16:37,654
Does the filming set
remind me of Do Ra?

312
00:16:39,054 --> 00:16:41,895
Or is it because
that lady touched my body?

313
00:16:44,794 --> 00:16:46,235
This is ridiculous.

314
00:16:54,274 --> 00:16:56,704
Excuse me. One moment, please.

315
00:16:56,845 --> 00:16:58,345
What's with her?

316
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:04,814
What is it?

317
00:17:04,914 --> 00:17:06,715
I'm sorry, Mr. Gong.

318
00:17:06,715 --> 00:17:08,215
How much does your suit cost?

319
00:17:08,755 --> 00:17:10,755
It seems quite expensive.

320
00:17:11,255 --> 00:17:12,724
If you don't want the laundry fee,

321
00:17:12,724 --> 00:17:15,295
I will reimburse you for the suit.

322
00:17:16,325 --> 00:17:17,825
Do you have any idea
how much this will cost?

323
00:17:19,065 --> 00:17:21,494
Please tell me how much it is.

324
00:17:23,065 --> 00:17:25,934
I'll give you the money
once I get paid next month.

325
00:17:26,704 --> 00:17:27,835
Forget it.

326
00:17:27,835 --> 00:17:30,045
Then please let me
at least pay to get it cleaned.

327
00:17:30,045 --> 00:17:31,404
Can I have your number?

328
00:17:32,974 --> 00:17:34,875
Mr. Oh, let's go.

329
00:17:34,974 --> 00:17:36,014
Yes, sir.

330
00:17:39,214 --> 00:17:40,785
I feel so bad.

331
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:46,424
Grandma told me
to always watch where I was going,

332
00:17:47,194 --> 00:17:48,694
but I was being clumsy.

333
00:17:49,224 --> 00:17:51,625
I truly hope you don't work
at other restaurants.

334
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,795
You not causing trouble
is a good day for anyone.

335
00:17:56,234 --> 00:17:59,875
Now that I'm doing odd chores,
they just treat me as mud.

336
00:18:04,345 --> 00:18:05,674
What should I do to make a living?

337
00:18:07,615 --> 00:18:08,815
What do I do?

338
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:20,325
(Baekamkwan Cabaret Nightclub)

339
00:18:57,464 --> 00:19:00,934
My gosh. Did Tae Hee say...

340
00:19:01,065 --> 00:19:03,135
she was interested in Jin Dan
back in New York?

341
00:19:03,135 --> 00:19:05,135
My gosh. Really?

342
00:19:05,135 --> 00:19:08,875
My goodness.
What an interesting turn of fate.

343
00:19:09,404 --> 00:19:11,904
Yes. I see.

344
00:19:12,545 --> 00:19:14,214
Of course.

345
00:19:14,214 --> 00:19:16,585
As long as they're okay with it,
I hope they will go out...

346
00:19:16,585 --> 00:19:18,914
and end up getting married
within this year.

347
00:19:19,414 --> 00:19:20,414
Yes.

348
00:19:21,055 --> 00:19:22,115
All right.

349
00:19:22,825 --> 00:19:24,885
Okay. It's settled then.

350
00:19:25,454 --> 00:19:27,395
Yes. Bye.

351
00:19:28,325 --> 00:19:31,424
Auntie Dae Sook, did you just
talk about marriage?

352
00:19:31,525 --> 00:19:34,395
I guess that's what
they already talked about.

353
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,865
My gosh. Even without
an engagement ceremony?

354
00:19:37,535 --> 00:19:39,805
People these days don't
have an engagement ceremony.

355
00:19:40,335 --> 00:19:42,135
We will let them date
for about a year...

356
00:19:42,135 --> 00:19:45,704
and get married at the end
of this year or next spring.

357
00:19:46,514 --> 00:19:49,944
Auntie Dae Sook, you know
how hard I've been trying...

358
00:19:49,944 --> 00:19:51,984
to find someone for him to marry.

359
00:19:52,115 --> 00:19:54,855
But things didn't work out
every time.

360
00:19:55,385 --> 00:19:57,184
I must say
there's nothing you can't do.

361
00:19:57,184 --> 00:19:59,325
Thank you so much.

362
00:19:59,895 --> 00:20:01,454
This isn't just about marriage.

363
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,924
Illyu Foods is
a big enough company...

364
00:20:03,924 --> 00:20:06,865
to be able to support Jin Dan
as his in-laws.

365
00:20:06,994 --> 00:20:08,535
Of course.

366
00:20:08,535 --> 00:20:11,365
Illyu Foods is good enough
to give him some protection.

367
00:20:11,464 --> 00:20:12,704
Exactly.

368
00:20:12,704 --> 00:20:15,805
Then people will stop calling him
a child of a mistress.

369
00:20:17,704 --> 00:20:21,145
How could she call me
a mistress like that?

370
00:20:21,514 --> 00:20:23,684
It's just impossible to like her.

371
00:20:26,355 --> 00:20:28,414
Okay. This is it.

372
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:31,125
(Solid men's blazer coat)

373
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,754
Hang on. How much is this?

374
00:20:34,754 --> 00:20:38,224
What? Is it 5,600 dollars?

375
00:20:38,994 --> 00:20:41,694
What kind of clothes
cost more than 5,000 dollars?

376
00:20:41,694 --> 00:20:43,434
This is ridiculous.

377
00:20:43,434 --> 00:20:46,575
I know it's designer clothes,
but this is just too much.

378
00:20:50,244 --> 00:20:53,815
So I ruined
an expensive blazer like this?

379
00:20:55,315 --> 00:20:56,885
What do I do?

380
00:20:58,345 --> 00:21:01,315
("Don't Lie")

381
00:21:04,954 --> 00:21:07,295
No matter how painful
the memories are,

382
00:21:07,994 --> 00:21:09,924
they are a part of me.

383
00:21:10,025 --> 00:21:11,224
They form my life...

384
00:21:12,395 --> 00:21:14,095
and show the path I've been on.

385
00:21:15,395 --> 00:21:18,105
If you truly love that woman,

386
00:21:18,504 --> 00:21:20,504
you should help her
get what she wants.

387
00:21:21,835 --> 00:21:23,075
Isn't that love?

388
00:21:23,345 --> 00:21:25,474
Doing what the other person wants.

389
00:21:39,085 --> 00:21:41,555
Ji Young, can we talk for a moment?

390
00:21:49,817 --> 00:21:51,017
Where are we going?

391
00:21:52,017 --> 00:21:53,456
We're almost there.

392
00:21:53,456 --> 00:21:54,926
Wait a little more.

393
00:22:03,966 --> 00:22:06,997
Director Ko, I'm here.

394
00:22:08,567 --> 00:22:11,507
Why did you want to talk to me
at this time of night?

395
00:22:12,176 --> 00:22:14,406
And what's with the bikes?

396
00:22:14,706 --> 00:22:17,206
You wanted to regain your memories.

397
00:22:17,206 --> 00:22:19,646
Right, I do.

398
00:22:19,977 --> 00:22:20,987
But...

399
00:22:21,287 --> 00:22:24,257
I'm sure everyone has at least
been on a bicycle once.

400
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:26,116
So who knows?

401
00:22:26,216 --> 00:22:28,926
Riding it around the park
might bring back some memories.

402
00:22:30,227 --> 00:22:32,997
You're now trying to help me
gain my memories back.

403
00:22:32,997 --> 00:22:34,926
I'm truly grateful.

404
00:22:35,327 --> 00:22:39,166
Still, I lived by the sea
my whole life,

405
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:42,206
so why would riding a bike
bring back any memories?

406
00:22:43,037 --> 00:22:45,676
Also, I don't know how to ride one.

407
00:22:46,106 --> 00:22:47,277
It'll come to you.

408
00:22:47,446 --> 00:22:49,977
I told you I didn't know
how to ride one.

409
00:22:49,977 --> 00:22:51,747
- Just get on it, will you?
- My gosh.

410
00:22:52,777 --> 00:22:54,146
Director Ko, my gosh.

411
00:22:54,847 --> 00:22:56,186
Did you just speak in a dialect?

412
00:22:56,186 --> 00:22:57,787
That's right, so get on it.

413
00:23:01,126 --> 00:23:03,156
But...

414
00:23:03,626 --> 00:23:05,827
I don't know how to ride one.

415
00:23:06,057 --> 00:23:08,827
Ji Young, I'll keep it steady
from behind you,

416
00:23:08,896 --> 00:23:10,267
so trust me and get on it.

417
00:23:10,497 --> 00:23:12,567
Besides, you need to be able...

418
00:23:12,567 --> 00:23:14,866
to run errands on bikes
in urgent situations on set.

419
00:23:15,237 --> 00:23:18,636
I can't have a new recruit
who can't ride a bike.

420
00:23:18,876 --> 00:23:20,706
I guess you're right.

421
00:23:21,347 --> 00:23:24,216
Then I'll give it a try.

422
00:23:29,287 --> 00:23:31,416
- Here.
- Sure.

423
00:23:36,656 --> 00:23:38,156
Gosh, this is scary.

424
00:23:39,156 --> 00:23:40,696
It's fine. You can do it.

425
00:23:40,926 --> 00:23:42,097
Step on the pedal.

426
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:44,737
Hold on.

427
00:23:46,097 --> 00:23:48,466
Why can't I keep it steady?

428
00:23:48,466 --> 00:23:49,866
Tell me you're still holding on.

429
00:23:49,866 --> 00:23:52,037
Ji Young, I'm holding on tight,

430
00:23:52,037 --> 00:23:53,206
so look straight ahead.

431
00:23:53,436 --> 00:23:55,547
I got you, so keep pedaling.

432
00:23:55,547 --> 00:23:58,047
All right. I'll keep pedaling,

433
00:23:58,047 --> 00:23:59,277
so don't you let go.

434
00:24:01,017 --> 00:24:03,186
- My gosh!
- Looking good.

435
00:24:04,156 --> 00:24:05,317
You're doing great.

436
00:24:06,757 --> 00:24:07,757
Director...

437
00:24:08,757 --> 00:24:11,426
Director Ko,
you're still holding on, right?

438
00:24:13,396 --> 00:24:16,027
Why aren't you answering me?

439
00:24:16,297 --> 00:24:18,696
Director Ko,
you'd better be behind me.

440
00:24:19,866 --> 00:24:21,206
Are you not?

441
00:24:24,436 --> 00:24:26,577
Wait, am I riding it by myself?

442
00:24:26,577 --> 00:24:30,077
Gosh!
Director Ko, this isn't as promised.

443
00:24:30,706 --> 00:24:32,547
I'll fall.

444
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:35,317
Help!

445
00:24:45,827 --> 00:24:46,997
Ji Young, are you all right?

446
00:24:56,307 --> 00:24:57,366
Yes,

447
00:24:59,337 --> 00:25:00,406
I'm good.

448
00:25:19,126 --> 00:25:20,196
By the way,

449
00:25:21,426 --> 00:25:24,126
how long was I riding it by myself?

450
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:26,097
From way over there.

451
00:25:27,337 --> 00:25:29,037
What? Really?

452
00:25:30,537 --> 00:25:32,507
I said you could ride one, remember?

453
00:25:34,577 --> 00:25:38,247
But how did you know
I could ride a bike?

454
00:25:38,847 --> 00:25:40,577
I had a hunch, that's all.

455
00:25:42,247 --> 00:25:45,386
Like this, you will regain
your memory one by one.

456
00:25:45,956 --> 00:25:47,386
That was your first memory.

457
00:25:49,287 --> 00:25:52,057
I can't believe
I knew how to ride a bike.

458
00:25:53,356 --> 00:25:55,227
Director Ko, thank you.

459
00:25:55,896 --> 00:25:59,166
Anyway, I had a blast riding this.

460
00:25:59,396 --> 00:26:00,537
Then take it for another spin.

461
00:26:01,307 --> 00:26:03,267
Sure, but hold onto the bike.

462
00:26:03,267 --> 00:26:05,507
- Got it.
- Don't you lie this time.

463
00:26:05,537 --> 00:26:06,977
All right. Look straight ahead.

464
00:26:10,847 --> 00:26:11,876
This is so fun.

465
00:26:17,047 --> 00:26:18,856
- Look ahead.
- Okay.

466
00:26:27,426 --> 00:26:28,797
Ma Ri,

467
00:26:28,966 --> 00:26:31,337
what brings you here at this hour?

468
00:26:32,396 --> 00:26:35,406
I wanted to have
some of your cheonggukjang...

469
00:26:35,866 --> 00:26:38,037
and see Pil Seung.

470
00:26:38,337 --> 00:26:41,446
If I get here too late,
it'll be after he goes to work.

471
00:26:42,446 --> 00:26:44,676
He hasn't gone to work yet, has he?

472
00:26:45,477 --> 00:26:48,317
Right. He hasn't left for work yet.

473
00:26:48,487 --> 00:26:50,487
Really? What a relief.

474
00:26:50,487 --> 00:26:53,057
Can I say hi today?

475
00:26:53,116 --> 00:26:55,327
I have something to give him.

476
00:26:55,327 --> 00:26:57,287
Here comes Pil Seung.

477
00:26:57,827 --> 00:26:59,456
Pil Seung, hi!

478
00:26:59,527 --> 00:27:01,067
Finally, we meet again.

479
00:27:01,827 --> 00:27:04,396
Hey, Ma Ri.

480
00:27:05,237 --> 00:27:06,297
Pil Seung,

481
00:27:06,896 --> 00:27:09,666
why don't you two talk
and have breakfast together?

482
00:27:10,206 --> 00:27:12,537
She's been wanting to see you.

483
00:27:13,676 --> 00:27:14,747
Me?

484
00:27:16,077 --> 00:27:17,347
Is that so?

485
00:27:17,747 --> 00:27:19,916
But I have a meeting
before filming begins today,

486
00:27:19,916 --> 00:27:21,287
and I have to head out.

487
00:27:22,287 --> 00:27:24,656
Right now?
Do you have to go right away?

488
00:27:25,487 --> 00:27:27,727
I'm afraid so.
Ma Ri, maybe next time.

489
00:27:28,087 --> 00:27:31,196
Pil Seung, wait.
I have something for you.

490
00:27:31,527 --> 00:27:32,527
What?

491
00:27:32,597 --> 00:27:34,027
- For me?
- Yes.

492
00:27:35,997 --> 00:27:38,366
Here. It's my gift to you.

493
00:27:39,797 --> 00:27:40,837
A gift?

494
00:27:41,436 --> 00:27:43,106
Yes, please open it.

495
00:27:43,767 --> 00:27:46,737
If you don't like it,
I'll get you something else.

496
00:27:46,837 --> 00:27:48,047
Pil Seung, come on.

497
00:27:48,047 --> 00:27:50,406
I don't know how busy you are,
but at least open that.

498
00:27:50,747 --> 00:27:53,347
Be considerate of how
she came here this early.

499
00:27:53,517 --> 00:27:55,646
She's right, Pil Seung.
Let's see what it is.

500
00:28:01,186 --> 00:28:02,186
This...

501
00:28:03,057 --> 00:28:05,557
That's a luxurious watch.

502
00:28:05,557 --> 00:28:07,196
It costs
tens of thousands of dollars.

503
00:28:07,196 --> 00:28:09,027
- What?
- What did you say?

504
00:28:09,027 --> 00:28:10,767
- Tens of thousands of dollars?
- Yes.

505
00:28:13,837 --> 00:28:17,206
Ma Ri, I can't accept
a gift this expensive,

506
00:28:17,206 --> 00:28:18,537
so I'll just appreciate the gesture.

507
00:28:20,037 --> 00:28:21,077
I'm sorry.

508
00:28:21,547 --> 00:28:22,807
I'll see you around, then.

509
00:28:23,347 --> 00:28:24,376
I'm off to work.

510
00:28:24,376 --> 00:28:26,317
- Sure. Have a good day.
- Sure.

511
00:28:31,517 --> 00:28:34,487
Did I do something wrong?

512
00:28:36,257 --> 00:28:37,856
Ma Ri, my gosh.

513
00:28:38,227 --> 00:28:40,557
No, you didn't do anything wrong.

514
00:28:42,126 --> 00:28:44,196
Why don't we have a seat?

515
00:28:45,097 --> 00:28:48,106
Honey, wait.
This seems to be the better choice.

516
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,376
Honey,

517
00:28:55,406 --> 00:28:57,347
are you still angry with me?

518
00:29:01,787 --> 00:29:02,787
Honey,

519
00:29:03,817 --> 00:29:05,216
can't you...

520
00:29:06,317 --> 00:29:09,027
let me handle Ma Ri's situation?

521
00:29:19,136 --> 00:29:21,136
Why is Sun Young calling
at this hour?

522
00:29:23,507 --> 00:29:24,876
Hey, Sun Young.

523
00:29:27,176 --> 00:29:28,247
What?

524
00:29:28,807 --> 00:29:30,307
Ma Ri's at your place?

525
00:29:49,227 --> 00:29:51,997
Ji Young, why don't we
listen to a song?

526
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,537
There's one
I wanted to play for you.

527
00:29:56,136 --> 00:29:57,206
Sure.

528
00:29:58,136 --> 00:29:59,206
I'd like that.

529
00:30:02,646 --> 00:30:04,176
Turn on the last song played.

530
00:30:04,376 --> 00:30:06,317
(Turn on the last song played.)

531
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:10,547
Gosh, there's a song
he wants me to listen?

532
00:30:11,146 --> 00:30:13,116
Could it be a love song?

533
00:30:13,716 --> 00:30:14,956
One about a marriage proposal?

534
00:30:15,287 --> 00:30:16,926
One, two, three, four.

535
00:30:16,926 --> 00:30:19,997
<i>I'm attracted to her</i>

536
00:30:19,997 --> 00:30:23,196
<i>I'm falling for her</i>

537
00:30:23,527 --> 00:30:27,097
<i>The woman who stole my heart</i>

538
00:30:27,097 --> 00:30:28,106
Do Ra,

539
00:30:28,406 --> 00:30:30,866
I'll turn around and sing out loud.

540
00:30:30,966 --> 00:30:34,136
So don't worry about me
and relieve yourself. Okay?

541
00:30:34,136 --> 00:30:35,146
Okay.

542
00:30:40,416 --> 00:30:43,787
<i>I'm attracted to her</i>

543
00:30:43,787 --> 00:30:47,287
<i>I'm falling for her</i>

544
00:30:47,487 --> 00:30:52,097
<i>The woman who stole my heart</i>

545
00:30:52,196 --> 00:30:57,327
<i>Real, real, she's a real deal</i>

546
00:30:57,366 --> 00:31:00,466
<i>She's a total real deal</i>

547
00:31:00,636 --> 00:31:04,007
<i>The real deal has just appeared</i>

548
00:31:05,007 --> 00:31:06,606
<i>Eat your chicken and peep</i>

549
00:31:07,406 --> 00:31:09,606
Hold on.

550
00:31:09,876 --> 00:31:11,777
Is this the song...

551
00:31:12,616 --> 00:31:13,817
you wanted to play for me?

552
00:31:13,817 --> 00:31:14,916
Isn't it a blast?

553
00:31:15,886 --> 00:31:16,886
Ji Young,

554
00:31:17,416 --> 00:31:19,557
have you listened
to this song before,

555
00:31:19,557 --> 00:31:22,087
or did a guy ever sing it for you?

556
00:31:23,386 --> 00:31:28,166
What kind of a man
plays this song for a woman?

557
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:35,206
What is his problem?

558
00:31:35,767 --> 00:31:38,337
I wasn't expecting
the most romantic song,

559
00:31:38,577 --> 00:31:40,436
but "eat your chicken and peep?"

560
00:31:41,446 --> 00:31:43,477
Where did he even pick that up?

561
00:32:01,327 --> 00:32:03,966
Why on earth
did he play that song for me?

562
00:32:05,537 --> 00:32:07,196
Fine.

563
00:32:07,966 --> 00:32:09,966
Let's see what the lyrics mean.

564
00:32:13,906 --> 00:32:15,247
(The woman who stole my heart)

565
00:32:15,247 --> 00:32:16,277
(Real, real, she's a real deal.)

566
00:32:16,577 --> 00:32:17,577
Gosh.

567
00:32:18,277 --> 00:32:20,716
It's about a guy
expressing his love for her.

568
00:32:23,347 --> 00:32:25,087
"I'm attracted to her."

569
00:32:26,787 --> 00:32:28,626
Does he mean he's attracted to me?

570
00:32:31,426 --> 00:32:33,356
"I'm falling for her."

571
00:32:34,527 --> 00:32:35,597
What the...

572
00:32:35,797 --> 00:32:38,037
Is he saying he's falling for me?

573
00:32:38,567 --> 00:32:39,666
Goodness.

574
00:32:41,507 --> 00:32:42,567
My gosh.

575
00:32:43,436 --> 00:32:46,936
He expressed his feelings for me,

576
00:32:46,936 --> 00:32:48,106
but all I heard...

577
00:32:48,106 --> 00:32:50,847
was the last part
that is "eat your chicken and peep."

578
00:32:53,216 --> 00:32:54,347
Still,

579
00:32:54,987 --> 00:32:57,347
can't he be a man...

580
00:32:57,347 --> 00:32:58,716
and just say...

581
00:32:58,716 --> 00:33:01,757
that he has feelings for me?

582
00:33:02,186 --> 00:33:04,956
How am I supposed
to read between the lines?

583
00:33:05,827 --> 00:33:09,027
I'm terrible
at catching onto these things.

584
00:33:10,466 --> 00:33:11,567
You fool.

585
00:33:21,337 --> 00:33:23,106
What now?

586
00:33:23,206 --> 00:33:25,747
Why is he looking at me
with those lovey-dovey eyes?

587
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:27,847
Tell me how you feel...

588
00:33:28,487 --> 00:33:30,416
rather than staring at me!

589
00:33:38,327 --> 00:33:39,757
Get in here.

590
00:33:40,926 --> 00:33:41,966
Unbelievable.

591
00:33:42,696 --> 00:33:45,466
Ma Ri, what's the matter with you?

592
00:33:45,466 --> 00:33:46,597
It's rude to go
to someone else's house...

593
00:33:46,597 --> 00:33:48,537
so early in the morning
without giving them notice.

594
00:33:48,537 --> 00:33:50,737
Whatever. I'm upset as is,

595
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,277
so don't add it.

596
00:33:52,436 --> 00:33:53,477
- Ma Ri!
- What...

597
00:33:55,876 --> 00:33:57,547
Goodness me.

598
00:33:57,676 --> 00:33:59,347
She got in a cab...

599
00:33:59,347 --> 00:34:01,747
without Do Jun knowing,
carrying this expensive watch.

600
00:34:02,287 --> 00:34:04,757
What if something
had happened to her?

601
00:34:04,886 --> 00:34:07,557
Gosh, what's this?

602
00:34:08,426 --> 00:34:10,787
Did she take it from home
for Sun Young's son?

603
00:34:10,987 --> 00:34:13,926
Ma Ri needs to be given an earful.

604
00:34:14,057 --> 00:34:16,166
She'll cause big trouble
at this rate.

605
00:34:16,997 --> 00:34:19,696
This is exactly why
I lied about Pil Seung...

606
00:34:19,696 --> 00:34:21,136
having a girlfriend.

607
00:34:21,136 --> 00:34:22,636
It was to get her to give up.

608
00:34:23,136 --> 00:34:27,037
Honey, you need
to tell her off harshly this time...

609
00:34:27,037 --> 00:34:28,446
so that she doesn't do
anything like this again.

610
00:34:28,707 --> 00:34:31,077
Unbelievable.

611
00:34:31,546 --> 00:34:34,176
So much for a peaceful morning.

612
00:34:34,616 --> 00:34:36,046
Goodness.

613
00:34:43,187 --> 00:34:44,227
Ma Ri.

614
00:34:45,397 --> 00:34:46,557
I told you before...

615
00:34:46,557 --> 00:34:48,727
that it was dangerous for you
to go out by yourself.

616
00:34:50,127 --> 00:34:53,836
Why would you go out on your own
when Do Jun is here for you?

617
00:34:54,366 --> 00:34:56,636
On top of that, you took
an expensive watch with you.

618
00:35:00,377 --> 00:35:01,377
Dad,

619
00:35:01,377 --> 00:35:04,147
Pil Seung must not
be interested in me at all.

620
00:35:04,816 --> 00:35:07,147
Everyone gladly
became friends with me...

621
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:09,187
after receiving
the gifts I got them.

622
00:35:10,287 --> 00:35:13,116
I thought it'd be the same with him,

623
00:35:14,616 --> 00:35:16,656
but he left for work...

624
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:17,787
without bothering
to even look at the watch.

625
00:35:18,997 --> 00:35:22,097
He must hate me because I'm stupid.

626
00:35:22,696 --> 00:35:24,627
It's not like that, Ma Ri.

627
00:35:24,836 --> 00:35:27,997
Ma Ri, you are a sweet girl.

628
00:35:29,406 --> 00:35:32,006
Then, can't you help me?

629
00:35:32,607 --> 00:35:35,377
Have him fall for me.

630
00:35:36,147 --> 00:35:38,847
You're a powerful man
who can make anything happen.

631
00:35:41,816 --> 00:35:43,417
Do you like him that much?

632
00:35:44,247 --> 00:35:46,586
Yes, I like him a lot.

633
00:35:47,086 --> 00:35:49,026
From the second I met him,

634
00:35:49,026 --> 00:35:50,787
I felt my whole body buzzing.

635
00:35:50,787 --> 00:35:52,926
It's as if we were connected
in our past lives.

636
00:35:54,966 --> 00:35:56,267
Please, Dad.

637
00:35:57,296 --> 00:35:59,336
Can't you help me?

638
00:36:00,097 --> 00:36:01,097
Please?

639
00:36:28,667 --> 00:36:29,926
Sweetheart.

640
00:36:29,926 --> 00:36:32,437
Make do with this
for the time being.

641
00:36:32,437 --> 00:36:34,097
Buy whatever you need.

642
00:36:34,597 --> 00:36:37,537
I didn't want
to put you out like this.

643
00:36:37,537 --> 00:36:39,437
Gosh, I feel terrible.

644
00:36:39,437 --> 00:36:43,046
I want to give you the money.

645
00:36:43,046 --> 00:36:45,546
Get yourself a pretty dress.

646
00:36:45,676 --> 00:36:49,216
Also, I'm looking
for a decent studio apartment,

647
00:36:49,347 --> 00:36:51,086
so be patient.

648
00:36:51,687 --> 00:36:53,486
Thank you so much.

649
00:36:53,486 --> 00:36:54,957
I'm a lucky girl...

650
00:36:54,957 --> 00:36:57,586
for being able to meet
a generous man like you.

651
00:36:57,627 --> 00:37:00,656
You're the only one I have.

652
00:37:00,656 --> 00:37:03,597
The only one. My gosh.

653
00:37:03,997 --> 00:37:05,236
You thief!

654
00:37:05,236 --> 00:37:07,366
How dare you pocket that?
Give it here.

655
00:37:07,366 --> 00:37:09,636
- Honey?
- You rat!

656
00:37:09,636 --> 00:37:11,776
How dare you?

657
00:37:11,776 --> 00:37:12,937
I can't believe...

658
00:37:12,937 --> 00:37:14,807
you were giving money
to this old hag.

659
00:37:14,807 --> 00:37:16,446
Let go of me.

660
00:37:16,446 --> 00:37:19,517
Hey! Forget it.

661
00:37:19,517 --> 00:37:22,017
You gold-digger.
Where do you think you're going?

662
00:37:23,517 --> 00:37:24,787
How could you?

663
00:38:12,989 --> 00:38:16,440
Mom, I got you Korean melon,
your favorite.

664
00:38:19,843 --> 00:38:22,302
She said she didn't have work today.
Did she go somewhere?

665
00:38:27,713 --> 00:38:28,713
Mom?

666
00:38:33,153 --> 00:38:34,182
Mom...

667
00:38:35,753 --> 00:38:39,593
What happened to you?

668
00:38:39,593 --> 00:38:42,563
Why are you in this state?
Who did this to you?

669
00:38:43,193 --> 00:38:45,563
It's nothing, Do Sik.

670
00:38:45,563 --> 00:38:47,102
As if.

671
00:38:48,563 --> 00:38:50,773
Did you run into former creditors?

672
00:38:50,773 --> 00:38:52,003
Did they do this to you?

673
00:38:52,432 --> 00:38:55,872
I said it was nothing. I'm fine.

674
00:38:57,543 --> 00:39:00,713
Mom, what's going on? Just tell me.

675
00:39:02,713 --> 00:39:03,713
Do Sik,

676
00:39:06,352 --> 00:39:07,852
I worked at restaurants...

677
00:39:08,722 --> 00:39:11,253
washing dishes and mopping floors.

678
00:39:12,793 --> 00:39:15,563
I wanted to take your advice
and try all that I could.

679
00:39:15,563 --> 00:39:17,293
However,
it isn't working out for me.

680
00:39:18,633 --> 00:39:20,662
Most places
won't give me any work...

681
00:39:21,463 --> 00:39:22,802
saying I'm too old.

682
00:39:23,633 --> 00:39:26,773
How can life be this hard?

683
00:39:27,702 --> 00:39:28,872
Mom, please.

684
00:39:29,972 --> 00:39:31,343
Do Sik,

685
00:39:32,813 --> 00:39:34,943
I can't live like this anymore.

686
00:39:37,782 --> 00:39:39,452
That being said,

687
00:39:41,082 --> 00:39:43,722
I only have the skills
that I managed to obtain so far...

688
00:39:44,793 --> 00:39:47,963
which is why I want to start
a new entertainment agency.

689
00:39:49,523 --> 00:39:52,193
You want to start
a talent agency again?

690
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:53,403
That's right.

691
00:39:53,602 --> 00:39:56,673
I made Do Ra
into the top celebrity that she was.

692
00:39:56,673 --> 00:40:00,102
So I'll let the world
have another Park Do Ra.

693
00:40:00,102 --> 00:40:02,503
I still have a lot of connections
in the entertainment industry,

694
00:40:02,503 --> 00:40:03,872
so I know I can do it.

695
00:40:03,872 --> 00:40:06,043
Do Sik, please.

696
00:40:06,782 --> 00:40:09,113
Help me do that
if you have the money.

697
00:40:09,582 --> 00:40:10,983
- Help me out.
- Mom...

698
00:40:10,983 --> 00:40:12,782
- Help me.
- Mom!

699
00:40:13,722 --> 00:40:15,653
As if I have any money.

700
00:40:17,722 --> 00:40:19,153
Help me.

701
00:40:45,383 --> 00:40:46,582
Fasten your seat belt.

702
00:40:47,082 --> 00:40:48,323
Of course.

703
00:40:51,722 --> 00:40:53,722
Look at him
being worried about my safety.

704
00:40:54,523 --> 00:40:57,162
How sweet of him.

705
00:41:03,162 --> 00:41:04,733
By the way, Director Ko,

706
00:41:05,403 --> 00:41:07,343
allow me to buy dinner today.

707
00:41:08,043 --> 00:41:10,573
What would you like to have?

708
00:41:12,343 --> 00:41:13,582
That isn't necessary.

709
00:41:14,142 --> 00:41:15,213
Gosh.

710
00:41:15,313 --> 00:41:19,153
My grandma said
people who like freebies go bald.

711
00:41:19,383 --> 00:41:21,682
I'll lose my hair
if you keep treating me.

712
00:41:23,452 --> 00:41:26,423
You came to my rescue yesterday,

713
00:41:27,262 --> 00:41:30,032
so I'll treat you today
as a thank-you.

714
00:41:31,963 --> 00:41:33,293
Treat me next time, then.

715
00:41:33,432 --> 00:41:35,162
I already organized today's dinner.

716
00:41:35,832 --> 00:41:39,133
Today, let's eat outdoors
as we enjoy the clear air.

717
00:41:40,702 --> 00:41:41,742
Okay.

718
00:41:44,573 --> 00:41:45,573
My gosh.

719
00:41:46,242 --> 00:41:47,983
He smiled at me just now.

720
00:41:48,642 --> 00:41:49,742
What does that mean?

721
00:41:50,613 --> 00:41:52,282
Is today D-day?

722
00:41:53,082 --> 00:41:55,182
Is he going to assault me
with a confession of love?

723
00:41:56,153 --> 00:41:57,722
My heart's beating so hard.

724
00:42:05,892 --> 00:42:07,302
I should...

725
00:42:07,302 --> 00:42:08,702
No. Sit down.

726
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:12,372
Let me help.

727
00:42:12,472 --> 00:42:15,242
You're doing all the work
on your own.

728
00:42:15,602 --> 00:42:16,673
It's all done.

729
00:42:18,173 --> 00:42:19,242
Ji Young.

730
00:42:20,912 --> 00:42:22,012
Sit here,

731
00:42:23,113 --> 00:42:24,452
drink this tea,

732
00:42:25,052 --> 00:42:27,452
and look at the stars and flowers.

733
00:42:30,193 --> 00:42:31,392
It's hot, so be careful.

734
00:42:49,573 --> 00:42:50,613
Gosh.

735
00:42:51,043 --> 00:42:53,142
What kind of luxury is this?

736
00:42:54,182 --> 00:42:56,613
I'm being treated like a princess.

737
00:42:58,412 --> 00:43:02,722
Director Ko must think
so much of women.

738
00:43:03,323 --> 00:43:05,653
He's such a cool, romantic guy.

739
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:10,133
How could I not fall for such a man?

740
00:43:10,633 --> 00:43:12,793
There's no exit
from this heart-beat highway.

741
00:43:22,773 --> 00:43:24,642
Isn't that a guitar?

742
00:43:25,043 --> 00:43:26,883
You know how to play?

743
00:43:27,582 --> 00:43:29,242
Yes. I'm pretty good.

744
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:32,613
Is he going to assault me
with a song?

745
00:43:33,153 --> 00:43:36,923
Oh, gosh. It might be cringy.

746
00:43:42,323 --> 00:43:44,363
<i>What is there</i>

747
00:43:45,162 --> 00:43:48,963
<i>That I can do</i>

748
00:43:49,202 --> 00:43:51,102
<i>For you?</i>

749
00:43:52,602 --> 00:43:54,773
<i>I think about that</i>

750
00:43:57,642 --> 00:44:01,543
<i>Just sitting quietly</i>
<i>And listening to you talk</i>

751
00:44:01,543 --> 00:44:05,412
<i>Walking down the street</i>
<i>As I keep pace with you</i>

752
00:44:05,412 --> 00:44:07,923
<i>Singing a friendly song</i>

753
00:44:07,923 --> 00:44:11,523
<i>For you</i>

754
00:44:13,823 --> 00:44:16,293
<i>Which jerk</i>

755
00:44:16,892 --> 00:44:22,363
<i>Made my Ji Young angry?</i>

756
00:44:22,733 --> 00:44:24,432
<i>Just say the word</i>

757
00:44:24,602 --> 00:44:27,073
<i>I will scold him</i>

758
00:44:27,343 --> 00:44:31,173
<i>Very harshly</i>

759
00:44:31,173 --> 00:44:33,813
<i>If things get hard</i>

760
00:44:33,983 --> 00:44:38,852
<i>You can always lean on me</i>

761
00:44:39,182 --> 00:44:43,483
<i>I'm stronger than you think</i>

762
00:44:43,523 --> 00:44:48,093
<i>Both my heart and body</i>

763
00:44:56,032 --> 00:44:57,332
That was awesome.

764
00:44:57,773 --> 00:45:00,702
That was so touching, Director Ko.

765
00:45:04,742 --> 00:45:05,813
Was that okay?

766
00:45:06,372 --> 00:45:09,113
Yes. It was so amazing.

767
00:45:10,043 --> 00:45:11,582
Never in my life...

768
00:45:11,582 --> 00:45:14,352
did I hear
such a moving performance.

769
00:45:15,682 --> 00:45:16,722
Thanks.

770
00:45:16,992 --> 00:45:18,023
Sit back down.

771
00:45:24,133 --> 00:45:25,133
Ji Young.

772
00:45:27,633 --> 00:45:29,503
Did any thoughts...

773
00:45:30,773 --> 00:45:32,173
or memories come to mind?

774
00:45:33,802 --> 00:45:34,872
Yes.

775
00:45:37,343 --> 00:45:38,343
What was it?

776
00:45:39,943 --> 00:45:41,213
The night sky.

777
00:45:41,912 --> 00:45:44,153
The breeze, the stars,
the smell of flowers.

778
00:45:45,253 --> 00:45:47,282
And the beautiful sound
of the guitar.

779
00:45:51,193 --> 00:45:52,293
We live in...

780
00:45:52,793 --> 00:45:56,262
a world that's beautiful
and worth living in.

781
00:45:56,492 --> 00:45:58,832
That's what I thought.

782
00:46:01,903 --> 00:46:04,773
It's such a romantic evening,
Director Ko.

783
00:46:09,343 --> 00:46:10,343
Is it?

784
00:46:11,872 --> 00:46:14,313
I'm glad you liked my guitar solo.

785
00:46:16,282 --> 00:46:17,483
Let's go home now.

786
00:46:19,113 --> 00:46:20,153
Already?

787
00:46:20,452 --> 00:46:21,983
Yes. It's late.

788
00:46:31,593 --> 00:46:33,662
What was that? That's it?

789
00:46:36,802 --> 00:46:39,332
Why did he bring me
all the way here and not confess?

790
00:46:43,912 --> 00:46:47,043
Wait. Is there
another planned event?

791
00:46:59,923 --> 00:47:01,122
You can sleep if you're tired.

792
00:47:01,793 --> 00:47:03,023
I'll wake you when we're there.

793
00:47:05,733 --> 00:47:08,563
No. I'm not sleepy at all.

794
00:47:12,573 --> 00:47:13,843
I'm dead sleepy.

795
00:47:14,642 --> 00:47:17,573
Why did I eat the meat
and ramyeon too?

796
00:47:18,372 --> 00:47:20,983
I'm so full,
I can't keep my eyes open.

797
00:47:23,412 --> 00:47:26,483
When is he going to say he likes me?

798
00:47:26,483 --> 00:47:27,983
Why is he stalling?

799
00:47:28,883 --> 00:47:30,452
I'm so sleepy.

800
00:48:00,682 --> 00:48:01,722
My gosh.

801
00:48:03,753 --> 00:48:06,093
Why... What's wrong?

802
00:48:07,023 --> 00:48:09,963
Are you covering me up
in case I feel cold?

803
00:48:10,693 --> 00:48:13,063
Yes. It's late at night.

804
00:48:13,332 --> 00:48:15,302
It's getting a bit chilly.

805
00:48:20,202 --> 00:48:22,472
Let's stop all this stuff.

806
00:48:23,343 --> 00:48:25,043
We can get to the point.

807
00:48:25,742 --> 00:48:28,843
I'm ready and prepared for it.

808
00:48:29,642 --> 00:48:33,412
So you can stop stalling.

809
00:48:34,323 --> 00:48:36,082
Confess to me already.

810
00:48:38,193 --> 00:48:39,222
What?

811
00:48:39,892 --> 00:48:42,262
Confess what to you?

812
00:48:44,093 --> 00:48:47,162
I'd be long dead
if I were any more impatient.

813
00:48:47,863 --> 00:48:49,932
You took me to a camping site,

814
00:48:49,932 --> 00:48:52,133
sang to me,
and let me see the stars.

815
00:48:52,133 --> 00:48:53,202
That's not all.

816
00:48:53,202 --> 00:48:55,073
You took me to and from work...

817
00:48:55,242 --> 00:48:56,872
and bought me dinner all the time.

818
00:48:57,073 --> 00:48:58,142
And then...

819
00:48:58,142 --> 00:49:00,412
you took me to the Han River
and taught me how to ride a bike.

820
00:49:00,912 --> 00:49:02,182
And just now...

821
00:49:03,012 --> 00:49:06,182
you covered me up
with a blanket in case I felt cold.

822
00:49:07,782 --> 00:49:09,653
So why can't you say it?

823
00:49:11,492 --> 00:49:13,693
That you like me.

824
00:49:14,892 --> 00:49:15,892
You do, right?

825
00:49:17,633 --> 00:49:18,662
Well...

826
00:49:19,233 --> 00:49:22,003
Well, that's... So, Ji Young...

827
00:49:23,202 --> 00:49:24,602
Sorry if I gave you the wrong idea.

828
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:27,702
I was checking out
places to shoot at.

829
00:49:28,573 --> 00:49:31,173
You said you wanted to
get your memories back.

830
00:49:31,173 --> 00:49:32,472
I thought going to lots of places...

831
00:49:32,472 --> 00:49:34,113
could help jog your memory.

832
00:49:34,412 --> 00:49:37,253
What I'm saying is,
I feel like I'm an older brother,

833
00:49:37,313 --> 00:49:39,452
and I want to help you
as a little sister.

834
00:49:42,452 --> 00:49:43,483
So...

835
00:49:44,423 --> 00:49:45,552
you're saying...

836
00:49:46,892 --> 00:49:50,023
you weren't nice to me
because you liked me?

837
00:49:52,032 --> 00:49:54,963
Did I ever ask you
to be my older brother?

838
00:49:55,432 --> 00:49:56,762
Did I ask for your help?

839
00:49:59,602 --> 00:50:01,702
Let me out. Right now!

840
00:50:11,653 --> 00:50:13,452
I'll take a taxi back.

841
00:50:13,653 --> 00:50:14,883
You can drive on.

842
00:50:21,992 --> 00:50:23,622
It's hard to find a taxi this late.

843
00:50:24,932 --> 00:50:26,992
Don't you care...

844
00:50:26,992 --> 00:50:28,432
whether I take a taxi or walk.

845
00:50:28,662 --> 00:50:30,702
Go on your way.

846
00:50:30,832 --> 00:50:32,773
I can't drive off leaving you here.

847
00:50:35,273 --> 00:50:37,443
Let me give you some advice.

848
00:50:38,173 --> 00:50:40,113
If you don't like the woman,

849
00:50:40,242 --> 00:50:42,713
don't play the guitar for her,
teach her how to ride a bike,

850
00:50:42,843 --> 00:50:44,512
buy her dinner and flowers,

851
00:50:44,753 --> 00:50:46,883
or drive her to
and from work every day.

852
00:50:48,483 --> 00:50:50,253
Don't look at her
with that warm gaze.

853
00:50:51,492 --> 00:50:52,892
Don't do any of that.

854
00:50:53,992 --> 00:50:55,093
Do you get that?

855
00:50:59,332 --> 00:51:02,003
(For hire)

856
00:51:06,332 --> 00:51:08,202
You did all that,
then said it meant nothing?

857
00:51:09,173 --> 00:51:11,943
You shouldn't toy
with someone's feelings like that.

858
00:51:12,372 --> 00:51:15,182
I'm really so darn offended!

859
00:51:29,863 --> 00:51:31,463
After flirting with me...

860
00:51:31,932 --> 00:51:34,133
and shaking me up like that,

861
00:51:34,403 --> 00:51:37,102
he just wanted to help me
as a big brother?

862
00:51:37,673 --> 00:51:39,503
That's just absurd.

863
00:51:40,332 --> 00:51:43,302
Fine.
He's not interested in me at all.

864
00:51:43,302 --> 00:51:46,073
It's just pathetic
that I have a crush on him.

865
00:51:46,173 --> 00:51:48,582
I'll put an end to it tonight.

866
00:51:48,713 --> 00:51:50,242
It's over.

867
00:51:53,452 --> 00:51:54,552
Who is this?

868
00:51:55,782 --> 00:51:56,823
It's me.

869
00:51:57,722 --> 00:51:59,193
Will you open up the door?

870
00:52:01,823 --> 00:52:03,023
What does he want now?

871
00:52:03,992 --> 00:52:05,863
What do you want
at this time of night?

872
00:52:07,432 --> 00:52:09,063
I have something to tell you.

873
00:52:09,563 --> 00:52:10,903
Can we talk for a moment?

874
00:52:12,273 --> 00:52:13,302
Something to tell me?

875
00:52:14,642 --> 00:52:15,642
My gosh.

876
00:52:16,273 --> 00:52:19,512
Does he want to apologize
and ask me out?

877
00:52:40,903 --> 00:52:43,363
What is this?

878
00:52:45,733 --> 00:52:46,832
It's tteokbokki.

879
00:52:47,702 --> 00:52:49,273
What?

880
00:52:49,943 --> 00:52:51,142
Tteokbokki?

881
00:52:52,912 --> 00:52:54,582
You like tteokbokki, Ji Young.

882
00:52:55,512 --> 00:52:56,543
So...

883
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:59,383
eat this
and stop being so mad at me.

884
00:53:04,622 --> 00:53:07,193
I think I told you
not to do things like this.

885
00:53:08,563 --> 00:53:11,262
And you flirt with me again
using some tteokbokki at this hour?

886
00:53:12,293 --> 00:53:15,863
You even showed up here drunk.
Are you kidding me?

887
00:53:16,302 --> 00:53:18,102
Do you think I'm a country bumpkin
you can mess with?

888
00:53:19,802 --> 00:53:21,802
I've never felt that way about you.

889
00:53:24,073 --> 00:53:26,343
I just have my reason
for doing all this.

890
00:53:27,813 --> 00:53:29,483
So, Ji Young,

891
00:53:31,282 --> 00:53:33,983
can't we get along
like a big brother and a little sister?

892
00:53:36,122 --> 00:53:37,722
I don't want to.

893
00:53:38,793 --> 00:53:42,392
I don't want you
to be my big brother.

894
00:53:43,593 --> 00:53:46,563
Take this tteokbokki with you and leave.
You're upsetting me.

895
00:54:03,912 --> 00:54:05,883
(All For You)

896
00:54:08,352 --> 00:54:09,352
Welcome.

897
00:54:09,983 --> 00:54:10,992
Hello.

898
00:54:21,932 --> 00:54:23,332
Can I try this on?

899
00:54:23,332 --> 00:54:24,403
Sure.

900
00:54:32,142 --> 00:54:33,313
All right.

901
00:54:34,443 --> 00:54:35,843
This is pretty.

902
00:54:39,153 --> 00:54:40,713
My goodness.

903
00:54:41,282 --> 00:54:42,483
What's all this?

904
00:54:42,582 --> 00:54:45,253
I got my first paycheck today.

905
00:54:45,253 --> 00:54:48,262
One should buy gifts for the family
after receiving the first paycheck.

906
00:54:48,492 --> 00:54:49,892
So I bought something.

907
00:54:50,293 --> 00:54:53,392
Now that we live
under the same roof,

908
00:54:53,392 --> 00:54:55,733
you are like my family.

909
00:54:55,733 --> 00:54:57,903
You didn't have to do this.

910
00:54:57,903 --> 00:55:00,332
It's no big deal.

911
00:55:00,332 --> 00:55:03,102
The rent here is really cheap.

912
00:55:03,102 --> 00:55:05,313
This is nothing
compared to what you've done for me.

913
00:55:05,972 --> 00:55:08,282
Did you get me something too?

914
00:55:08,282 --> 00:55:10,142
Of course.

915
00:55:10,142 --> 00:55:11,653
This is for you.

916
00:55:11,653 --> 00:55:14,823
And this is for Mr. Ko.
This is for Ms. Kim.

917
00:55:14,823 --> 00:55:17,622
I also bought something
for Ms. Ko and Director Ko.

918
00:55:17,622 --> 00:55:19,253
That's so sweet.

919
00:55:19,253 --> 00:55:21,262
Let me try this on. Look at me.

920
00:55:21,262 --> 00:55:23,293
How do I look? Does it look good?

921
00:55:23,293 --> 00:55:24,932
What about me?

922
00:55:24,932 --> 00:55:28,032
You two look great in them.

923
00:55:28,032 --> 00:55:29,463
Ms. Kim, please go ahead
and try it on.

924
00:55:29,463 --> 00:55:31,403
- My gosh.
- Hurry. Try it on.

925
00:55:32,032 --> 00:55:34,003
- The color is so pretty.
- Hey.

926
00:55:34,003 --> 00:55:36,302
- It's the perfect size for you.
- I know.

927
00:55:36,302 --> 00:55:40,273
How can a young lady like you
have such a sharp eye?

928
00:55:40,642 --> 00:55:44,043
Thank you so much. I love it.

929
00:55:44,313 --> 00:55:45,912
You should buy something
for your grandmother.

930
00:55:45,912 --> 00:55:48,452
You didn't have to care about us.

931
00:55:48,452 --> 00:55:51,793
I got something for my grandma
and sent it by courier.

932
00:55:53,452 --> 00:55:55,923
By the way, aren't you
going to work today?

933
00:55:55,923 --> 00:55:58,032
I'm working
an afternoon shift today,

934
00:55:58,032 --> 00:56:00,032
- so I should leave now.
- I see.

935
00:56:00,032 --> 00:56:01,963
I'll get going then.

936
00:56:01,963 --> 00:56:03,633
- Okay.
- All right.

937
00:56:03,633 --> 00:56:06,673
- Thank you again for the clothes.
- It's my pleasure.

938
00:56:06,673 --> 00:56:08,202
- Bye.
- Thank you.

939
00:56:08,202 --> 00:56:09,802
- My goodness.
- How sweet.

940
00:56:09,802 --> 00:56:14,012
She's a young lady,
but she's well-mannered and considerate.

941
00:56:14,682 --> 00:56:16,713
She's not like
young people these days.

942
00:56:16,713 --> 00:56:19,952
Tell me about it.
And she's hard-working and clever.

943
00:56:27,892 --> 00:56:30,262
I just have my reason
for doing all this.

944
00:56:31,733 --> 00:56:33,392
So, Ji Young,

945
00:56:35,162 --> 00:56:37,733
can't we get along like
a big brother and a little sister?

946
00:56:39,133 --> 00:56:41,443
He has his reason
for doing all this?

947
00:56:43,443 --> 00:56:44,943
What's that supposed to mean?

948
00:56:46,613 --> 00:56:49,182
Are you okay, Ji Young?
Were you hurt?

949
00:56:52,613 --> 00:56:55,383
That's right.
Director Ko is interested in me.

950
00:56:55,923 --> 00:56:57,052
He likes me a lot.

951
00:56:57,852 --> 00:56:59,852
He has feelings for me,

952
00:56:59,852 --> 00:57:01,793
but there's a reason
why he can't be with me.

953
00:57:02,093 --> 00:57:04,932
That's why he wants
to act like my older brother.

954
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,662
I had no idea.

955
00:57:11,503 --> 00:57:14,372
By the way, what is the reason...

956
00:57:14,372 --> 00:57:16,702
that he can't be with me
when he has feelings for me?

957
00:57:21,943 --> 00:57:22,943
My gosh.

958
00:57:24,142 --> 00:57:27,753
Does he have
an incurable disease or something?

959
00:57:30,023 --> 00:57:31,052
Is he terminally ill?

960
00:57:35,323 --> 00:57:36,492
Where are you, Director Ko?

961
00:57:37,733 --> 00:57:38,793
Where are you?

962
00:57:44,372 --> 00:57:45,372
Ji Young.

963
00:57:59,113 --> 00:58:00,412
I'm here, Director Ko.

964
00:58:05,552 --> 00:58:07,523
What's the matter, Ji Young?
Is something wrong?

965
00:58:07,762 --> 00:58:09,323
I'm sorry, Director Ko.

966
00:58:10,693 --> 00:58:13,093
I lost my cool last night,

967
00:58:13,733 --> 00:58:17,102
so I didn't understand
what you were saying.

968
00:58:18,602 --> 00:58:19,702
What do you mean?

969
00:58:22,202 --> 00:58:23,602
Is it that...

970
00:58:25,972 --> 00:58:29,943
you're terminally ill or suffering
from an incurable disease?

971
00:58:31,582 --> 00:58:34,682
Is that why you can't go out with me
when you like me?

972
00:58:36,082 --> 00:58:38,222
I don't care about things like that.

973
00:58:39,023 --> 00:58:42,392
I still like you, Director Ko.

974
00:58:46,793 --> 00:58:48,563
I'll be by your side.

975
00:58:50,032 --> 00:58:53,133
I'm not going to leave you alone.

976
00:58:54,133 --> 00:58:55,202
Ji Young.

977
00:58:56,742 --> 00:58:58,173
What are you talking about?

978
00:58:59,543 --> 00:59:02,113
Who is suffering
from an incurable disease? Me?

979
00:59:15,262 --> 00:59:17,463
Aren't you ill, Director Ko?

980
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:19,492
Ji Young, I guess...

981
00:59:19,963 --> 00:59:22,363
you've been watching
too many soap operas.

982
00:59:22,903 --> 00:59:24,003
So...

983
00:59:25,273 --> 00:59:28,642
are you saying
I was mistaken about you again?

984
00:59:29,602 --> 00:59:30,872
I get it.

985
00:59:32,412 --> 00:59:34,983
You made me realize my place.

986
00:59:36,383 --> 00:59:40,113
The thing is,
I'm weak in the head, you know.

987
00:59:40,213 --> 00:59:42,952
So I get the wrong idea
when you're nice to me.

988
00:59:44,023 --> 00:59:47,693
Maybe we should quit carpooling now.

989
00:59:48,622 --> 00:59:52,032
And you should stop
being so nice to me.

990
00:59:52,693 --> 00:59:54,963
I'd like you to treat me...

991
00:59:54,963 --> 00:59:57,302
just as a staff member at work...

992
00:59:58,332 --> 01:00:01,372
and as a tenant renting a room
in your house when we're home.

993
01:00:12,012 --> 01:00:14,582
Hey, Jin Dan. What brings you here?

994
01:00:14,622 --> 01:00:17,222
I was just passing by
and popped in to say hello.

995
01:00:18,093 --> 01:00:19,293
Seriously?

996
01:00:20,452 --> 01:00:21,662
Thanks.

997
01:00:22,122 --> 01:00:25,392
I'm so moved
that my heart feels so warm.

998
01:00:25,492 --> 01:00:28,503
I didn't know
you cared about me so much.

999
01:00:28,802 --> 01:00:32,532
Jin Dan, you can call me
whenever you need me.

1000
01:00:32,532 --> 01:00:34,673
I'll come running to you
whenever you call me...

1001
01:00:34,673 --> 01:00:36,142
no matter where you are.

1002
01:00:36,543 --> 01:00:37,573
Okay.

1003
01:00:37,702 --> 01:00:38,813
My gosh.

1004
01:00:38,813 --> 01:00:39,813
- Mr. Cha.
- Yes.

1005
01:00:39,813 --> 01:00:40,843
Director Ko wants to see you.

1006
01:00:40,843 --> 01:00:42,043
- Now?
- Yes.

1007
01:00:43,043 --> 01:00:44,113
Oh, dear.

1008
01:00:44,213 --> 01:00:46,313
I'm sorry. This isn't a good time.

1009
01:00:46,313 --> 01:00:47,552
It's okay. Just go.

1010
01:00:47,552 --> 01:00:50,452
I just dropped in
to see how you were doing.

1011
01:00:50,582 --> 01:00:53,052
So you should get back to work now.

1012
01:00:53,052 --> 01:00:54,863
Don't worry about me. Just go.

1013
01:00:55,323 --> 01:00:56,793
- Are you sure? Okay.
- Yes.

1014
01:00:56,793 --> 01:00:59,892
Then I'll buy you a drink later.

1015
01:01:00,193 --> 01:01:02,032
- Okay.
- Thanks for this.

1016
01:01:03,463 --> 01:01:04,602
Let's go, Bi Bi.

1017
01:01:15,843 --> 01:01:18,753
Goodness. Hello, Mr. Gong.

1018
01:01:20,213 --> 01:01:21,653
Oh, right.

1019
01:01:22,852 --> 01:01:23,852
Gosh.

1020
01:01:25,093 --> 01:01:28,923
I was actually hoping
to see you again someday.

1021
01:01:29,923 --> 01:01:31,733
Me?

1022
01:01:32,432 --> 01:01:33,863
You wanted to see me?

1023
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:37,972
That suit of yours I ruined.

1024
01:01:38,573 --> 01:01:42,173
I looked it up and it costs
more than 5,000 dollars.

1025
01:01:43,372 --> 01:01:45,573
You said you were okay with it,

1026
01:01:46,043 --> 01:01:48,213
but I couldn't sleep at night...

1027
01:01:48,213 --> 01:01:50,543
without making up...

1028
01:01:50,943 --> 01:01:53,282
for ruining such an expensive suit.

1029
01:01:54,653 --> 01:01:55,653
So?

1030
01:01:55,782 --> 01:01:59,492
I don't have the money...

1031
01:01:59,793 --> 01:02:01,793
to replace the suit,

1032
01:02:04,122 --> 01:02:06,793
but I'd still like
to make it up to you somehow.

1033
01:02:09,602 --> 01:02:13,503
By the way, did you pay
the full 5,000 dollars for it?

1034
01:02:14,503 --> 01:02:17,443
Didn't you get it
while it was on sale?

1035
01:02:17,443 --> 01:02:20,012
Well... It wasn't on sale.

1036
01:02:21,483 --> 01:02:22,613
Really?

1037
01:02:23,713 --> 01:02:27,653
Then how much can I pay
to make it up to you?

1038
01:02:27,852 --> 01:02:30,852
Forget it. I threw it out anyway,
so don't worry about it.

1039
01:02:32,452 --> 01:02:35,863
Wait. You threw away a suit
that cost over 5,000 dollars?

1040
01:02:37,193 --> 01:02:38,293
Goodness.

1041
01:02:39,832 --> 01:02:43,863
It's an expensive suit,
and I still feel terrible.

1042
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:47,802
If you feel that way,
treat me to a meal.

1043
01:02:48,742 --> 01:02:49,773
A meal?

1044
01:02:51,472 --> 01:02:52,613
By the way,

1045
01:02:53,372 --> 01:02:55,813
I'm curious about the watch
Ma Ri brought over yesterday.

1046
01:02:56,512 --> 01:02:58,852
Does it really cost
over tens of thousands of dollars?

1047
01:02:59,782 --> 01:03:03,352
A watch costs as much as a car.

1048
01:03:03,352 --> 01:03:04,952
How does that make any sense?

1049
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:07,492
There are watches
that cost more than 100,000 dollars.

1050
01:03:08,593 --> 01:03:10,222
Goodness me.

1051
01:03:10,722 --> 01:03:12,293
How can you walk around...

1052
01:03:12,293 --> 01:03:14,262
wearing a watch
that costs six figures?

1053
01:03:14,262 --> 01:03:15,832
What if someone cuts off your wrist?

1054
01:03:15,832 --> 01:03:17,863
Mother, please.

1055
01:03:20,202 --> 01:03:21,443
Anyway,

1056
01:03:22,503 --> 01:03:25,372
was it necessary
to refuse the gift...

1057
01:03:26,512 --> 01:03:28,713
that Ma Ri brought over for him?

1058
01:03:29,182 --> 01:03:31,113
If he didn't want it,

1059
01:03:31,113 --> 01:03:33,582
he could've given it
to my Hyun Chul.

1060
01:03:33,582 --> 01:03:35,352
- Mother, please.
- What?

1061
01:03:35,753 --> 01:03:37,122
Are you home?

1062
01:03:37,782 --> 01:03:38,952
Is anyone home?

1063
01:03:39,552 --> 01:03:40,852
That sounds like a man.

1064
01:03:41,193 --> 01:03:43,622
- Who could it be?
- Beats me.

1065
01:03:43,963 --> 01:03:46,133
Honey, he's here.

1066
01:03:46,332 --> 01:03:48,903
Gong Jin Taek.

1067
01:03:48,903 --> 01:03:50,863
- Who?
- Gong Jin Taek.

1068
01:03:50,863 --> 01:03:52,573
Who's here?

1069
01:03:53,773 --> 01:03:55,872
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

1070
01:03:56,403 --> 01:03:57,742
I'm aware...

1071
01:03:58,443 --> 01:03:59,943
that this is ill-mannered
on my part,

1072
01:03:59,943 --> 01:04:01,682
but I came by to say something.

1073
01:04:03,383 --> 01:04:04,883
You're welcomed here.

1074
01:04:05,313 --> 01:04:06,952
You can visit at any time...

1075
01:04:06,952 --> 01:04:09,282
especially since the families
are acquainted.

1076
01:04:10,222 --> 01:04:12,423
I hear Ma Ri
has been randomly coming by...

1077
01:04:12,423 --> 01:04:14,093
putting you all out.

1078
01:04:14,593 --> 01:04:15,762
I apologize for that.

1079
01:04:18,593 --> 01:04:22,162
As you know,
Ma Ri is still immature...

1080
01:04:22,662 --> 01:04:24,032
due to the accident she was in.

1081
01:04:25,032 --> 01:04:26,932
I ask for your understanding.

1082
01:04:27,372 --> 01:04:30,102
Please don't say that.

1083
01:04:30,302 --> 01:04:32,372
Of course, we understand.

1084
01:04:32,843 --> 01:04:36,713
Besides,
she might talk like a child,

1085
01:04:36,983 --> 01:04:39,682
but she's polite and adorable.

1086
01:04:40,012 --> 01:04:43,323
We're all fond of her.

1087
01:04:43,582 --> 01:04:45,952
I appreciate you saying that.

1088
01:04:47,753 --> 01:04:50,762
Anyway, I came by today...

1089
01:04:52,593 --> 01:04:54,903
to seek approval...

1090
01:04:55,662 --> 01:04:58,032
for what I'm about to propose.

1091
01:05:02,102 --> 01:05:03,503
I've been fond of Pil Seung...

1092
01:05:04,242 --> 01:05:06,573
for quite a long time now.

1093
01:05:12,782 --> 01:05:15,523
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1094
01:05:47,713 --> 01:05:50,282
The second Pil Seung
marries into that family,

1095
01:05:50,282 --> 01:05:51,753
he'll have wealthy in-laws.

1096
01:05:51,753 --> 01:05:53,622
What Pil Seung wants
is more important.

1097
01:05:53,622 --> 01:05:56,323
If he likes Ma Ri,
everything will be good.

1098
01:05:56,323 --> 01:05:57,622
If not, it won't work out.

1099
01:05:57,662 --> 01:06:01,133
Is Pil Seung dating your tenant?

1100
01:06:01,133 --> 01:06:02,262
Why is Pil Seung...

1101
01:06:02,262 --> 01:06:04,872
coming from her unit
at this early hour?

1102
01:06:04,872 --> 01:06:06,202
We need to talk.

1103
01:06:06,332 --> 01:06:08,173
Why were you
stepping out of Mr. Gong's car?

1104
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:09,573
Don't have meals with him.

1105
01:06:09,573 --> 01:06:10,843
Don't spend time with him either!

1106
01:06:12,213 --> 01:06:14,213
