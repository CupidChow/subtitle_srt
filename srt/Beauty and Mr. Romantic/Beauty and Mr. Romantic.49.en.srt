(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

00:00:07,703 --> 00:00:09,743
(Episode 49)

3
00:00:13,123 --> 00:00:14,423
Mom.

4
00:00:15,314 --> 00:00:17,413
Jin Dan. Are you okay?

5
00:00:17,654 --> 00:00:19,784
You look dreadful.

6
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:24,554
I'm okay.

7
00:00:24,853 --> 00:00:26,223
Mom.

8
00:00:26,594 --> 00:00:29,123
What do you mean
we have cash to leave with?

9
00:00:29,434 --> 00:00:31,594
Where did you get so much money?

10
00:00:31,594 --> 00:00:35,103
It's in here.
Your brother gave it to me.

11
00:00:36,134 --> 00:00:38,810
Jin Taek gave you the money?

12
00:00:38,834 --> 00:00:41,104
Yes. He said...

13
00:00:41,104 --> 00:00:43,520
APP Group and family would look bad
if you got caught.

14
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:46,190
So he wants us to leave the country.

15
00:00:46,214 --> 00:00:49,344
He talked about
Park Do Ra's attempted murder.

16
00:00:49,413 --> 00:00:51,813
Jin Dan.
You didn't do that, did you?

17
00:00:52,114 --> 00:00:55,524
No way, Mom. Would I do that?
Are you crazy?

18
00:00:55,684 --> 00:00:57,054
Gong Jin Dan!

19
00:00:58,254 --> 00:00:59,664
Oh, no.

20
00:00:59,824 --> 00:01:01,124
Mom.

21
00:01:01,824 --> 00:01:03,593
Did you bring him here?

22
00:01:03,593 --> 00:01:05,334
What do you mean?

23
00:01:05,763 --> 00:01:07,334
Darn it.

24
00:01:07,663 --> 00:01:10,204
Was this money bait?

25
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:11,834
What? Bait?

26
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:15,644
Mom, run!

27
00:01:17,273 --> 00:01:18,614
Gong Jin Dan!

28
00:01:21,284 --> 00:01:23,913
- Mom, run. Faster!
- What?

29
00:01:23,913 --> 00:01:25,413
My gosh.

30
00:01:25,413 --> 00:01:26,653
What...

31
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:29,453
Mom, are you all right?

32
00:01:29,853 --> 00:01:31,954
- Why are you wearing heels?
- I can't.

33
00:01:31,954 --> 00:01:33,894
- Go without me.
- What?

34
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:36,224
I'm sorry about this.

35
00:01:36,364 --> 00:01:39,264
Pil Seung, let Jin Dan be.

36
00:01:39,264 --> 00:01:42,263
Let him go. Don't go after him!

37
00:01:42,633 --> 00:01:45,034
Move!

38
00:01:45,034 --> 00:01:47,474
My goodness.

39
00:01:47,743 --> 00:01:49,373
What on earth?

40
00:01:49,573 --> 00:01:51,243
- Get him!
- What's wrong with him?

41
00:01:51,243 --> 00:01:53,413
- He's a criminal.
- What's going on?

42
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,814
- He hurt Park Do Ra.
- What?

43
00:01:57,353 --> 00:02:00,024
Don't come near me, darn it!

44
00:02:03,993 --> 00:02:05,293
Darn.

45
00:02:05,293 --> 00:02:07,424
- Yes, it's him.
- That rat!

46
00:02:07,424 --> 00:02:10,034
- It's him.
- That jerk.

47
00:02:27,444 --> 00:02:29,954
He drove Park Do Ra
to try to kill herself!

48
00:02:29,954 --> 00:02:31,053
- Why you...
- You punk.

49
00:02:31,053 --> 00:02:32,514
- It's him.
- He's despicable.

50
00:02:32,514 --> 00:02:33,723
Look here.

51
00:02:33,723 --> 00:02:35,584
Having money doesn't give you
the right to do that.

52
00:02:35,584 --> 00:02:38,324
- How dare you?
- I can't believe him.

53
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,063
- What a rat.
- Take that!

54
00:02:40,063 --> 00:02:41,694
- He's a criminal.
- Darn him.

55
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:44,694
Is this the police?
I'd like to report someone.

56
00:02:45,294 --> 00:02:47,033
I have Gong Jin Dan,

57
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:49,164
the man wanted for embezzlement
and attempted murder.

58
00:02:49,164 --> 00:02:50,433
- Darn you.
- What did I tell you?

59
00:02:50,433 --> 00:02:52,033
- Please come quick.
- You rat.

60
00:02:52,033 --> 00:02:55,744
- You'll get what's coming.
- Take that!

61
00:02:56,414 --> 00:02:58,650
- Over here!
- Take him away.

62
00:02:58,674 --> 00:03:00,444
- Coming through.
- There they are.

63
00:03:00,444 --> 00:03:01,944
- Arrest him.
- Good for you.

64
00:03:01,944 --> 00:03:03,114
He should be locked up.

65
00:03:03,114 --> 00:03:05,053
- Darn it.
- I can't believe it.

66
00:03:05,053 --> 00:03:07,854
- You rat.
- Serves him right.

67
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:08,854
He's a spoiled rich kid.

68
00:03:08,854 --> 00:03:11,670
It's him. It's Ko Pil Seung.

69
00:03:11,694 --> 00:03:13,300
He beat me up.

70
00:03:13,324 --> 00:03:15,640
Take him too. Lock him up too!

71
00:03:15,664 --> 00:03:18,264
I won't ever settle with him.

72
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:20,710
Hey. Who are you saying hit you?

73
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,734
That joke would make a dog bark.

74
00:03:22,734 --> 00:03:24,273
- Yes.
- My gosh.

75
00:03:24,273 --> 00:03:25,604
- You scumbag.
- What a jerk.

76
00:03:25,604 --> 00:03:28,403
You're the reason
Park Do Ra drowned,

77
00:03:28,403 --> 00:03:30,243
and you're upset
you got hit a few times?

78
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,789
- Why you darn...
- That's enough.

79
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,643
Stop it, all of you!

80
00:03:34,813 --> 00:03:37,714
Mr. Gong Jin Dan.
You're under arrest for slander,

81
00:03:37,854 --> 00:03:40,183
defamation, embezzlement,

82
00:03:40,183 --> 00:03:41,629
- and attempted murder.
- Unbelievable.

83
00:03:41,653 --> 00:03:43,294
- Take the bag.
- It's mine!

84
00:03:43,294 --> 00:03:46,264
It's mine, you jerks! It's mine!

85
00:03:46,264 --> 00:03:47,963
You can hire a lawyer,

86
00:03:47,963 --> 00:03:50,593
make excuses for yourself,
refuse to incriminate yourself,

87
00:03:50,593 --> 00:03:52,810
and challenge this arrest in court.

88
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:55,734
- Let's go.
- Wait. Why are you taking just me?

89
00:03:55,734 --> 00:03:57,473
That punk beat me up!

90
00:03:57,473 --> 00:03:59,743
You should arrest him too!

91
00:03:59,743 --> 00:04:01,379
- Take him too!
- Take him!

92
00:04:01,403 --> 00:04:03,520
- Get lost!
- Ko Pil Seung!

93
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:05,843
- Darn you!
- Good riddance.

94
00:04:05,843 --> 00:04:07,384
- Get lost.
- Hey!

95
00:04:10,585 --> 00:04:12,153
(Ko Pil Seung and the Public
Caught Gong Jin Dan!)

96
00:04:12,153 --> 00:04:14,584
Look at this. My goodness.

97
00:04:14,584 --> 00:04:16,330
Is this true?

98
00:04:16,354 --> 00:04:18,994
Pil Seung caught Gong Jin Dan?

99
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:20,993
What's all this about?

100
00:04:20,993 --> 00:04:23,269
- How did he do that?
- Yes.

101
00:04:23,293 --> 00:04:24,994
I don't know exactly,

102
00:04:24,994 --> 00:04:26,879
but from what I read in the news,

103
00:04:26,903 --> 00:04:29,709
over 30 members of the public
and Pil Seung...

104
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:31,934
surrounded Gong Jin Dan
and kept him there.

105
00:04:32,304 --> 00:04:33,343
My gosh.

106
00:04:33,343 --> 00:04:35,144
He was beaten to a pulp,

107
00:04:35,144 --> 00:04:37,773
but because there were
so many people,

108
00:04:37,773 --> 00:04:39,644
no one knows who hit him.

109
00:04:39,644 --> 00:04:41,814
When the police asked,
they said they had no idea.

110
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:42,853
- What?
- My gosh.

111
00:04:42,853 --> 00:04:45,283
How angry do you think they were...

112
00:04:45,283 --> 00:04:47,329
if they all ganged up against him?

113
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:49,999
It's a good thing
that Gong Jin Dan's behind bars,

114
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:52,329
but APP Group's a mess right now.

115
00:04:52,353 --> 00:04:53,839
- What?
- Why?

116
00:04:53,863 --> 00:04:56,209
Gong Jin Dan made it look like
Do Ra had a sponsor.

117
00:04:56,233 --> 00:04:58,564
And he also tried to kill her.

118
00:04:58,894 --> 00:05:01,603
People are boycotting APP Group,

119
00:05:01,603 --> 00:05:04,674
protesting outside the company,
and their stock price fell.

120
00:05:04,773 --> 00:05:06,704
There's never been this bad a mess.

121
00:05:06,704 --> 00:05:08,449
Myung Dong.

122
00:05:08,473 --> 00:05:11,949
Gong Jin Dan has nothing to do
with APP Group.

123
00:05:11,973 --> 00:05:14,360
Gong Jin Dan is not really
Gong Jin Dan.

124
00:05:14,384 --> 00:05:16,283
He's Jin Jin Dan.

125
00:05:16,613 --> 00:05:20,354
We know that but the public doesn't.

126
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:23,199
Oh, dear.

127
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:26,994
Chairman Gong
just adopted Pil Seung.

128
00:05:28,064 --> 00:05:30,294
Why is there such a huge mess?

129
00:05:31,394 --> 00:05:32,963
Darn it.

130
00:05:34,224 --> 00:05:37,572
(Ko Pil Seung and the Public
Caught Gong Jin Dan!)

131
00:05:50,754 --> 00:05:52,913
They caught the dirtbag.

132
00:05:53,884 --> 00:05:56,453
Let's forget about him now.

133
00:05:59,394 --> 00:06:00,963
How can I forget him?

134
00:06:06,363 --> 00:06:07,703
Do Sik.

135
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:10,934
Take me to see him.

136
00:06:12,574 --> 00:06:15,504
I want to ask him something.

137
00:06:16,773 --> 00:06:19,143
Why did he do this to me?

138
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:21,360
I want to ask why.

139
00:06:21,384 --> 00:06:23,054
- No, don't.
- Do Ra.

140
00:06:23,054 --> 00:06:25,283
- It's dangerous.
- Don't, Do Ra. Calm down.

141
00:06:29,994 --> 00:06:31,294
Do Sik.

142
00:06:33,523 --> 00:06:34,963
Do Jun.

143
00:06:35,923 --> 00:06:37,234
I want to...

144
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:41,903
see him so I can slap him good.

145
00:06:43,374 --> 00:06:45,533
But I can't move.

146
00:06:45,874 --> 00:06:48,403
I can't move my legs.

147
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,643
Do Ra.

148
00:06:53,783 --> 00:06:56,444
Don't cry over someone like him.

149
00:06:56,954 --> 00:06:59,384
He's done for.
He'll rot in jail forever,

150
00:06:59,384 --> 00:07:01,424
and he'll never show himself.

151
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:04,924
Why would you even ruin your sight
by looking at him?

152
00:07:05,353 --> 00:07:09,294
Let's forget about him now, okay?

153
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:11,833
Yes, Do Ra.

154
00:07:12,494 --> 00:07:16,079
Now everyone knows
he lied that you had a sponsor.

155
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,573
Everyone knows what he did.

156
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:23,104
Do you know
how many people are rooting for you?

157
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,874
Thousands of people...

158
00:07:26,244 --> 00:07:29,144
comment online hoping
you'll stay strong and recover.

159
00:07:29,144 --> 00:07:33,083
So, let's hang in there.
Okay, Do Ra?

160
00:07:41,564 --> 00:07:43,593
So what?

161
00:07:44,963 --> 00:07:46,963
What good is that?

162
00:07:48,403 --> 00:07:50,680
He got arrested,

163
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:53,504
but it won't help me walk.

164
00:07:56,173 --> 00:07:57,544
Do Sik.

165
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,013
Do Jun.

166
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:04,453
What am I to do now?

167
00:08:05,754 --> 00:08:08,583
How am I to live now?

168
00:08:12,194 --> 00:08:13,523
Do Ra...

169
00:08:18,634 --> 00:08:19,963
Darn it.

170
00:08:32,413 --> 00:08:33,759
Hello.

171
00:08:33,783 --> 00:08:36,889
I'm the chairman of APP Group...

172
00:08:36,913 --> 00:08:38,454
Gong Jin Taek.

173
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:42,099
Angel Investment Corp.
is a subsidiary of our APP Group,

174
00:08:42,123 --> 00:08:45,594
and its ex-CEO Gong Jin Dan
has caused great turmoil.

175
00:08:46,294 --> 00:08:48,763
For the social unrest he caused,

176
00:08:49,093 --> 00:08:51,864
I apologize with all my heart.

177
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,890
There are a few misunderstandings...

178
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,714
surrounding APP Group,

179
00:09:09,784 --> 00:09:13,354
and I stand before you
in order to correct them.

180
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,954
Ex-CEO Gong Jin Dan...

181
00:09:17,694 --> 00:09:21,763
no longer has anything to do
with Angel Investment Corp.

182
00:09:22,463 --> 00:09:24,864
Our board dismissed him already.

183
00:09:25,263 --> 00:09:28,533
He also has nothing to do...

184
00:09:28,804 --> 00:09:30,773
with my family.

185
00:09:32,103 --> 00:09:33,874
Ex-CEO Gong Jin Dan...

186
00:09:35,103 --> 00:09:37,714
is not my brother at all.

187
00:09:39,473 --> 00:09:44,354
I will show you a report
of our DNA test.

188
00:09:45,113 --> 00:09:47,154
(None shared, No match,
They cannot be biological siblings.)

189
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:50,329
No way.

190
00:09:50,353 --> 00:09:52,354
I can't believe this.

191
00:09:52,454 --> 00:09:54,164
What's going on now?

192
00:09:54,164 --> 00:09:55,599
It's for real.

193
00:09:55,623 --> 00:09:57,270
That's an actual report.

194
00:09:57,294 --> 00:09:58,934
I lived my whole life thinking...

195
00:09:58,934 --> 00:10:03,634
Gong Jin Dan was related
to me by blood.

196
00:10:04,373 --> 00:10:05,903
But recently,

197
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:09,103
I found out he was not the son...

198
00:10:09,103 --> 00:10:12,413
of APP Group's former chairman...

199
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:15,214
and my father Chairman Gong Dae Gil.

200
00:10:16,013 --> 00:10:18,714
He deceived me
and my whole family...

201
00:10:18,753 --> 00:10:20,653
and hurt us beyond belief.

202
00:10:21,353 --> 00:10:24,893
I cannot forgive
all the atrocities he committed,

203
00:10:25,654 --> 00:10:28,540
and I'm currently suing him
to take back...

204
00:10:28,564 --> 00:10:32,533
Angel Investment Corp,
which he was given as inheritance.

205
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:37,574
I also sued to have him removed
from our family registry.

206
00:10:39,404 --> 00:10:41,244
I'll say this again.

207
00:10:41,904 --> 00:10:44,513
Ex-CEO Gong Jin Dan...

208
00:10:46,044 --> 00:10:49,214
has nothing to do with my family.

209
00:10:49,584 --> 00:10:50,954
However,

210
00:10:51,613 --> 00:10:53,884
actor Park Do Ra...

211
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:56,554
suffered a great deal at his hand,

212
00:10:56,554 --> 00:11:01,023
and I offered to compensate her
as best I can.

213
00:11:02,493 --> 00:11:05,793
So that Ms. Park can walk again,

214
00:11:06,064 --> 00:11:09,864
I will help her to the end
with the best of my abilities.

215
00:11:10,473 --> 00:11:14,443
Finally, I wish
Ms. Park makes a speedy recovery,

216
00:11:15,304 --> 00:11:18,513
and I apologize with all my heart.

217
00:11:19,352 --> 00:11:21,559
(APP Group's Gong Jin Taek
emergency press conference)

218
00:11:21,584 --> 00:11:23,332
(Position on ex-CEO Gong Jin Dan)

219
00:11:35,824 --> 00:11:38,494
Do Ra. Let's go back to your room.

220
00:11:38,863 --> 00:11:40,163
Okay.

221
00:11:43,934 --> 00:11:45,334
Do Ra.

222
00:11:47,552 --> 00:11:48,822
(Pil Seung)

223
00:11:51,174 --> 00:11:52,673
Hi, Pil Seung.

224
00:11:54,643 --> 00:11:57,484
Yes. I'm with Do Jun.

225
00:11:58,184 --> 00:11:59,653
I'm coming upstairs.

226
00:12:01,753 --> 00:12:03,594
Wait in my room.

227
00:12:17,574 --> 00:12:19,404
Hi. Did you get some air?

228
00:12:19,404 --> 00:12:20,773
Yes.

229
00:12:21,243 --> 00:12:23,650
Do Jun. I'm here to relieve you.

230
00:12:23,674 --> 00:12:24,819
Okay.

231
00:12:24,843 --> 00:12:27,084
Do Ra. I'll come back later.

232
00:12:27,544 --> 00:12:29,984
No, don't come back today.

233
00:12:30,013 --> 00:12:31,859
My carer will be here later.

234
00:12:31,883 --> 00:12:34,023
Okay. Call me, then.

235
00:12:35,383 --> 00:12:37,553
- Bye.
- Go on home.

236
00:12:46,664 --> 00:12:48,004
Do Ra.

237
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:50,433
Did you read the news?

238
00:12:52,774 --> 00:12:56,004
Yes. I did.

239
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:58,913
You caught Gong Jin Dan.

240
00:13:00,843 --> 00:13:02,484
Thank you, Pil Seung.

241
00:13:03,753 --> 00:13:05,354
Thank you so much.

242
00:13:07,054 --> 00:13:08,800
Thanks to you,

243
00:13:08,824 --> 00:13:10,724
I've let go of my grudges.

244
00:13:12,824 --> 00:13:15,594
All the things you've done for me...

245
00:13:16,893 --> 00:13:19,964
I will never forget them.

246
00:13:27,503 --> 00:13:28,844
Do Ra.

247
00:13:30,444 --> 00:13:32,043
Gong Jin Dan won't be able...

248
00:13:32,774 --> 00:13:34,943
to give you a hard time ever again.

249
00:13:39,454 --> 00:13:40,754
Do Ra.

250
00:13:42,084 --> 00:13:43,793
I know things are tough,

251
00:13:45,294 --> 00:13:46,824
but we can get over them together.

252
00:13:49,524 --> 00:13:51,263
After rehabilitation training,

253
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:53,763
you will be able to get up again.

254
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:56,104
I promise...

255
00:13:56,633 --> 00:13:58,874
I will make you walk again.

256
00:14:00,804 --> 00:14:04,074
I'll always be with you, okay?

257
00:14:10,054 --> 00:14:11,384
Okay.

258
00:14:12,314 --> 00:14:13,653
I see.

259
00:14:18,654 --> 00:14:19,994
Pil Seung.

260
00:14:20,424 --> 00:14:22,393
I feel suddenly hungry.

261
00:14:23,534 --> 00:14:26,439
You do? What do you want to eat?

262
00:14:26,463 --> 00:14:28,434
Just tell me anything,
and I'll get it for you.

263
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:29,763
Well...

264
00:14:31,603 --> 00:14:33,533
I want cream puffs...

265
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:36,273
and blueberry yogurt.

266
00:14:36,814 --> 00:14:38,214
I want some coffee too.

267
00:14:38,713 --> 00:14:40,743
Okay. I'll go buy them all.

268
00:14:40,743 --> 00:14:42,244
Wait a second.

269
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:05,933
Yogurt and coffee.

270
00:15:59,824 --> 00:16:01,964
Do Ra, you...

271
00:16:06,694 --> 00:16:08,063
Where did she go?

272
00:16:10,934 --> 00:16:13,303
Did she go out for a walk
with Do Jun again?

273
00:16:23,013 --> 00:16:24,713
Do Jun, it's me.

274
00:16:24,713 --> 00:16:27,013
Are you out with Do Ra now?

275
00:16:27,123 --> 00:16:29,653
No, I'm at the kalguksu diner now.

276
00:16:31,093 --> 00:16:32,893
Is Do Sik there too?

277
00:16:33,123 --> 00:16:34,724
Yes, he's here.

278
00:16:36,223 --> 00:16:38,494
Why? Isn't Do Ra there?

279
00:16:39,893 --> 00:16:43,263
No. I went out to buy some bread
for a moment,

280
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,334
and Do Ra isn't in her room.

281
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:48,343
I'll look for her.
I guess she's out to get some air.

282
00:16:48,343 --> 00:16:50,913
Don't worry. Bye.

283
00:17:10,264 --> 00:17:12,993
Wait. Excuse me.

284
00:17:13,064 --> 00:17:14,334
Patient Park Do Ra
isn't in her room.

285
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:16,240
Is she out for a test or something?

286
00:17:16,264 --> 00:17:19,774
No, all the tests were over
this morning.

287
00:17:20,244 --> 00:17:21,574
What?

288
00:17:22,244 --> 00:17:25,373
Then, where do you think she is now?

289
00:17:25,373 --> 00:17:26,574
Did you not see her?

290
00:17:26,574 --> 00:17:27,913
She was in her room
until just a few minutes ago,

291
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:28,943
but she's not there.

292
00:17:28,943 --> 00:17:31,653
Are you talking about Park Do Ra?

293
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:35,483
I just saw her leave the hospital
in the wheelchair.

294
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:37,393
What? She went out?

295
00:17:37,393 --> 00:17:38,723
Yes.

296
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,223
Thank you.

297
00:17:49,264 --> 00:17:50,604
Do Ra!

298
00:17:51,133 --> 00:17:52,473
Park Do Ra!

299
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:55,903
Do Ra!

300
00:17:57,413 --> 00:17:58,814
Park Do Ra!

301
00:18:00,514 --> 00:18:01,814
Do Ra!

302
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:05,683
Do Ra!

303
00:18:07,784 --> 00:18:09,153
Park Do Ra!

304
00:18:10,794 --> 00:18:12,124
Do Ra.

305
00:18:16,923 --> 00:18:18,233
Do Ra.

306
00:18:19,334 --> 00:18:20,703
Do Ra.

307
00:18:20,964 --> 00:18:24,074
Do Ra, are you all right?

308
00:18:24,633 --> 00:18:26,304
Why did you come out alone?

309
00:18:26,534 --> 00:18:28,143
Where were you going?

310
00:18:28,343 --> 00:18:30,613
If there was a place to go,
you should've told me.

311
00:18:30,613 --> 00:18:33,044
Look at you.
It could've been dangerous!

312
00:18:38,683 --> 00:18:41,884
I was going to run away
where you could never find me.

313
00:18:46,294 --> 00:18:49,094
Any place will be fine
as long as you can't find me.

314
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:51,764
What?

315
00:18:54,703 --> 00:18:56,163
Park Do Ra.

316
00:18:58,234 --> 00:18:59,673
Why are you being like this?

317
00:19:05,974 --> 00:19:07,514
I told you...

318
00:19:08,143 --> 00:19:10,213
that I couldn't stand the sight
of you.

319
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:13,354
I told you to get out of my face.

320
00:19:14,024 --> 00:19:16,659
But you're not going anywhere.

321
00:19:16,683 --> 00:19:20,054
That's why
I tried to run away from you.

322
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,864
Look at me, Pil Seung.

323
00:19:25,133 --> 00:19:27,034
Just look how miserable I am now.

324
00:19:29,064 --> 00:19:31,274
I can't even run away.

325
00:19:33,234 --> 00:19:36,104
I can't do anything on my own,

326
00:19:36,574 --> 00:19:39,643
and I can't go anywhere on my own.

327
00:19:40,383 --> 00:19:42,913
There's nothing I can do on my own.

328
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,753
But why would you stay with me?

329
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:54,093
Please just leave me
when I tell you to go!

330
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:55,663
Go away!

331
00:19:56,923 --> 00:19:58,233
Do Ra.

332
00:19:58,494 --> 00:19:59,794
Do Ra.

333
00:20:00,703 --> 00:20:02,403
I know how you feel.

334
00:20:03,834 --> 00:20:05,733
But this isn't what I want.

335
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,703
You are only breaking my heart.

336
00:20:09,504 --> 00:20:11,473
I'm happy when I'm with you.

337
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:15,243
Do Ra.

338
00:20:16,714 --> 00:20:18,453
We can get over this.

339
00:20:19,113 --> 00:20:22,124
So, Do Ra,
don't be like this ever again.

340
00:20:23,893 --> 00:20:25,594
Please don't do this.

341
00:20:30,693 --> 00:20:32,134
Please.

342
00:20:53,368 --> 00:20:54,839
Honey.

343
00:20:54,969 --> 00:20:56,084
Okay.

344
00:20:56,108 --> 00:20:57,354
Pil Seung.

345
00:20:57,378 --> 00:21:01,208
I know you're busy,
but can we talk for a moment?

346
00:21:04,249 --> 00:21:05,678
Okay, Dad.

347
00:21:10,719 --> 00:21:12,089
So,

348
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:16,059
what are you going to do now?

349
00:21:18,229 --> 00:21:19,698
What do you mean?

350
00:21:21,128 --> 00:21:22,998
About Do Ra.

351
00:21:27,069 --> 00:21:28,369
Dad.

352
00:21:29,108 --> 00:21:32,408
Do Ra will be able to walk again.

353
00:21:32,908 --> 00:21:34,609
The rehabilitation therapy
began already.

354
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:36,819
I believe...

355
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:40,718
Do Ra will get back up again.

356
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:42,789
Of course.

357
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:45,388
It will be nice if a miracle happens
and Do Ra walks again.

358
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:47,488
That's what we all hope for.

359
00:21:48,158 --> 00:21:52,099
But things don't always go the way
you want them to.

360
00:21:52,868 --> 00:21:56,769
What if she has to live like that
for the rest of her life?

361
00:21:58,499 --> 00:22:00,269
It doesn't change anything.

362
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:02,309
Mom.

363
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,639
However she ends up,

364
00:22:05,178 --> 00:22:07,079
I will always be with her.

365
00:22:07,249 --> 00:22:09,279
Pil Seung, that's...

366
00:22:10,219 --> 00:22:12,279
What about your own life?

367
00:22:12,448 --> 00:22:14,688
You have your whole life
ahead of you,

368
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:17,995
so how can you
let her weigh you down?

369
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:19,329
Mom.

370
00:22:19,989 --> 00:22:21,688
What do you mean
she'll weigh me down?

371
00:22:22,428 --> 00:22:24,359
Please don't say things like that.

372
00:22:24,628 --> 00:22:26,968
Besides,
we've been over this already.

373
00:22:27,428 --> 00:22:29,414
I married Do Ra...

374
00:22:29,438 --> 00:22:31,215
with you and Dad present.

375
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:33,809
Pil Seung, let's at least
get the facts straight.

376
00:22:33,969 --> 00:22:36,384
You didn't marry anyone.

377
00:22:36,408 --> 00:22:39,039
Technically,
your wedding never finished.

378
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:41,109
Please don't bring this up again.

379
00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:44,879
I don't want to hear it, so I won't.

380
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:47,418
I'm off to work.

381
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:51,019
But...

382
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:53,188
- What...
- My gosh.

383
00:22:54,229 --> 00:22:56,258
Mother, what do we do?

384
00:23:05,868 --> 00:23:07,738
Hey, Sun Young.

385
00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:11,779
I was about to call you
to talk about Pil Seung.

386
00:23:12,448 --> 00:23:14,248
Sure, we should meet right now.

387
00:23:20,348 --> 00:23:22,465
Park Do Sik, you punk.

388
00:23:22,489 --> 00:23:24,089
How can you act
like I don't exist...

389
00:23:24,089 --> 00:23:26,059
after all I did to raise you?

390
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:27,928
You brat.

391
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:38,599
You. Park Do Sik.

392
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:41,245
How can you not get me tofu...

393
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:43,815
when I was released
from lock-up today?

394
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,239
Anyway, forget that...

395
00:23:45,239 --> 00:23:46,908
and tell me the hospital
Do Ra is in.

396
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:48,678
It's none of your business.

397
00:23:49,148 --> 00:23:50,178
What?

398
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:52,549
Are you kidding me with that tone?

399
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:55,488
As her mother,
I should know how she is.

400
00:23:55,719 --> 00:23:57,319
Did you call her your daughter?

401
00:23:57,489 --> 00:24:00,559
I told you not to call us
or show up in our lives again.

402
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:01,958
Bye!

403
00:24:03,398 --> 00:24:05,658
Hey. Park Do...

404
00:24:06,469 --> 00:24:08,529
That darn brat.

405
00:24:08,898 --> 00:24:11,069
Who does he think he's talking to?

406
00:24:13,069 --> 00:24:16,678
Fine. I'll figure out
where she is myself.

407
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:21,008
As if you can keep me away
by not telling me.

408
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:23,555
You brats.

409
00:24:23,643 --> 00:24:25,178
(Park Do Ra hospital)

410
00:24:25,178 --> 00:24:26,989
(Park Do Ra, Be Back on Your Feet!
Fans Show Their Support)

411
00:24:26,989 --> 00:24:29,072
(Park Do Ra Might Not Walk Again
Because of Gong Jin Dan)

412
00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:32,619
Do Ra.

413
00:24:38,329 --> 00:24:39,668
Do Ra, please.

414
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:41,529
You didn't even finish
your meal earlier.

415
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:43,999
I'll have no choice
but to tell Pil Seung...

416
00:24:43,999 --> 00:24:45,898
that you're barely eating.

417
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:49,168
He'll stop what he's doing
and run over here.

418
00:24:55,009 --> 00:24:56,349
Do Ra.

419
00:24:56,519 --> 00:24:59,119
At least have one of these slices.

420
00:24:59,888 --> 00:25:02,648
How else will you have the energy
to get better?

421
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:20,109
My gosh.

422
00:25:20,638 --> 00:25:22,208
Please stay as you are.

423
00:25:22,269 --> 00:25:24,379
Sit comfortably.

424
00:25:33,688 --> 00:25:35,089
Do Jun.

425
00:25:35,448 --> 00:25:36,819
Yes?

426
00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:39,529
Go home and go about your day.

427
00:25:40,829 --> 00:25:42,859
My caregiver will be here later.

428
00:25:44,098 --> 00:25:47,069
All right, Do Ra.
Call me later, okay?

429
00:25:47,469 --> 00:25:48,799
Sure.

430
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:05,918
Do Ra.

431
00:26:07,219 --> 00:26:08,549
I am...

432
00:26:10,388 --> 00:26:13,329
devastated to see you...

433
00:26:14,829 --> 00:26:16,829
like this...

434
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:19,569
and am lost for words.

435
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:28,708
Do Ra.

436
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:34,648
My poor Pil Seung.

437
00:26:39,489 --> 00:26:41,819
What will you two do?

438
00:26:43,188 --> 00:26:45,718
What will you two do?

439
00:26:53,829 --> 00:26:55,269
Mother.

440
00:26:59,239 --> 00:27:02,309
I am aware of what you're implying.

441
00:27:05,009 --> 00:27:08,248
I don't want to be a burden
to him either.

442
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:13,819
That's why I've been asking him...

443
00:27:14,948 --> 00:27:16,958
not to come here...

444
00:27:17,688 --> 00:27:19,789
and even pleaded with him.

445
00:27:20,628 --> 00:27:23,359
But Pil Seung won't listen.

446
00:27:26,769 --> 00:27:28,099
I want...

447
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:31,398
to break up with him.

448
00:27:33,438 --> 00:27:36,478
Please let me end our relationship.

449
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:42,478
Even yesterday,
he caught me running away.

450
00:27:44,019 --> 00:27:45,349
I am...

451
00:27:46,418 --> 00:27:52,059
It kills me to let him see me
in this state.

452
00:27:54,158 --> 00:27:58,599
I want nothing more than to hide
in a place where he can't find me.

453
00:28:00,868 --> 00:28:02,299
Mother.

454
00:28:03,239 --> 00:28:05,769
Mother, this is what I want.

455
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,279
So please help me, Mother.

456
00:28:11,579 --> 00:28:13,408
But...

457
00:28:14,448 --> 00:28:16,418
You're already in pain,

458
00:28:16,819 --> 00:28:19,218
and I'm sorry
for only making it worse.

459
00:28:20,219 --> 00:28:23,065
What are you people doing here?

460
00:28:23,089 --> 00:28:26,089
Are you here to tell her
to end things with Pil Seung...

461
00:28:26,089 --> 00:28:28,759
now that she can't walk?

462
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:31,259
Mom, it's not that. Please don't.

463
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:34,329
Look at what happened to you.

464
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:38,168
How can you do this to her
when she can't even walk?

465
00:28:38,168 --> 00:28:40,908
How can people be this cruel?

466
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,079
Just leave
if that is why you're here.

467
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:45,815
- Get lost already!
- Mom...

468
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:47,124
Sun Young, let's go.

469
00:28:47,148 --> 00:28:48,948
It is wrong to swallow
only what's sweet...

470
00:28:48,948 --> 00:28:51,448
and spit out anything
that tastes bitter!

471
00:28:51,448 --> 00:28:53,648
Mom, stop it!

472
00:28:54,489 --> 00:28:56,458
How can people be this cruel?

473
00:28:56,458 --> 00:29:01,065
Anyway, look at the state you're in.

474
00:29:01,089 --> 00:29:03,128
Are your legs paralyzed?

475
00:29:03,128 --> 00:29:06,029
Is that why you can't walk?

476
00:29:06,029 --> 00:29:09,799
Goodness me.
What are we going to do?

477
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:12,168
- You poor thing.
- Mom.

478
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:13,468
What?

479
00:29:15,668 --> 00:29:18,579
I want to break up with Pil Seung.

480
00:29:20,948 --> 00:29:24,418
What can I do
to end our relationship?

481
00:29:27,388 --> 00:29:28,948
What are you saying?

482
00:29:28,948 --> 00:29:31,834
You must cling onto him
now more than ever.

483
00:29:31,858 --> 00:29:33,589
That is how you can live.

484
00:29:33,589 --> 00:29:34,705
No!

485
00:29:34,729 --> 00:29:38,658
I'd rather die
than let him see me this way.

486
00:29:39,259 --> 00:29:41,729
I'll do anything humanly possible...

487
00:29:41,729 --> 00:29:44,139
to end my relationship with him.

488
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:47,769
Mom, take me...

489
00:29:48,208 --> 00:29:52,708
Take me somewhere
he won’t find me, Mom.

490
00:29:53,509 --> 00:29:54,978
Mom...

491
00:29:55,509 --> 00:29:58,049
Mom, please take me away.

492
00:30:00,489 --> 00:30:01,889
What?

493
00:30:05,719 --> 00:30:08,658
Mom, please help me hide.

494
00:30:10,628 --> 00:30:11,958
Sun Young,

495
00:30:12,658 --> 00:30:15,529
I'll do the talking, so stay put.

496
00:30:16,239 --> 00:30:17,599
All right.

497
00:30:19,198 --> 00:30:20,668
She's probably going
to give us an earful...

498
00:30:20,668 --> 00:30:21,968
about what happened.

499
00:30:22,408 --> 00:30:24,339
I can't believe her.

500
00:30:24,608 --> 00:30:26,408
Her children abandoned her,

501
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:28,255
which is why
she wasn't at the wedding,

502
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:30,748
so what gives her the right
to speak as her mom?

503
00:30:32,249 --> 00:30:34,289
Back at the hospital,

504
00:30:35,089 --> 00:30:38,958
my heart ached to see Park Do Ra
like that.

505
00:30:40,628 --> 00:30:43,198
Seeing her in person was nothing
like reading news articles.

506
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:48,269
Soo Yeon, what do we do?

507
00:30:49,198 --> 00:30:51,799
Now that she is injured,

508
00:30:52,339 --> 00:30:55,738
Pil Seung will never be able
to leave her.

509
00:31:03,249 --> 00:31:04,549
Sun Young.

510
00:31:16,089 --> 00:31:17,559
Do Ra...

511
00:31:18,529 --> 00:31:21,228
must truly love Director Ko.

512
00:31:23,539 --> 00:31:26,139
She doesn't want to be a burden
to him...

513
00:31:27,108 --> 00:31:29,139
and wants to go...

514
00:31:29,579 --> 00:31:31,978
somewhere far
where he can’t find her.

515
00:31:33,178 --> 00:31:35,748
I was asked to make it happen...

516
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:39,119
and would like to do this for her,

517
00:31:40,418 --> 00:31:42,819
but I don't have any resources.

518
00:31:44,388 --> 00:31:46,258
That's why I came to discuss this...

519
00:31:47,128 --> 00:31:48,988
despite it being shameless of me.

520
00:31:50,529 --> 00:31:52,074
If you choose to help me,

521
00:31:52,098 --> 00:31:55,029
I'll take Do Ra somewhere far...

522
00:31:55,769 --> 00:31:57,139
and live quietly.

523
00:31:58,469 --> 00:32:00,644
Out of sight, out of mind.

524
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:04,839
He'll eventually forget about her
and move on.

525
00:32:06,448 --> 00:32:09,648
I'll move to the countryside
or somewhere abroad...

526
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:12,579
and live...

527
00:32:13,388 --> 00:32:16,389
with Do Ra in a nursing home.

528
00:32:18,259 --> 00:32:20,428
I'll leave with her
without even telling...

529
00:32:21,358 --> 00:32:22,829
my two sons.

530
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:14,248
Do Ra.

531
00:33:16,678 --> 00:33:18,879
Do you want to live in a place...

532
00:33:19,648 --> 00:33:21,019
hidden from everyone else?

533
00:33:21,589 --> 00:33:24,158
Do you want to leave with me?

534
00:33:27,458 --> 00:33:28,859
Mom.

535
00:33:30,029 --> 00:33:32,299
Can you do that for me?

536
00:33:34,029 --> 00:33:37,245
As long as Pil Seung can't find me,

537
00:33:37,269 --> 00:33:39,238
I will go anywhere.

538
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:44,238
Sure.

539
00:33:45,938 --> 00:33:47,809
We'll leave together.

540
00:34:15,432 --> 00:34:21,042
(Accessible Taxi Service)

541
00:34:32,358 --> 00:34:33,658
Do...

542
00:34:33,788 --> 00:34:35,228
Is Do Ra at physical therapy?

543
00:34:35,228 --> 00:34:36,628
Beats me.

544
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:40,128
- I'll take that.
- Sure.

545
00:34:45,038 --> 00:34:48,039
Do Jun, Do Sik.

546
00:34:49,069 --> 00:34:51,439
I'm going away for the time being...

547
00:34:52,378 --> 00:34:54,749
until Pil Seung moves on.

548
00:34:56,378 --> 00:34:58,648
I won't skip out
on physical therapy,

549
00:34:58,648 --> 00:35:00,249
so don't worry.

550
00:35:01,018 --> 00:35:03,088
I'll call when I'm stable enough.

551
00:35:05,058 --> 00:35:08,488
Please take care
of my grandma for me.

552
00:35:09,828 --> 00:35:11,128
Do Sik.

553
00:35:11,498 --> 00:35:12,558
Do Sik.

554
00:35:12,558 --> 00:35:14,869
- What is it?
- Read this.

555
00:35:15,128 --> 00:35:16,698
What's this?

556
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,738
You're here together.

557
00:35:21,569 --> 00:35:23,608
Anyway, where's Do Ra?

558
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:26,238
Pil Seung, read this.

559
00:35:26,748 --> 00:35:28,178
What?

560
00:35:43,128 --> 00:35:45,328
The phone is turned off.

561
00:35:45,328 --> 00:35:48,968
Please leave a message
after the tone.

562
00:35:50,438 --> 00:35:51,968
What happened today?

563
00:35:53,139 --> 00:35:54,568
I don't know.

564
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:56,069
You were with Do Ra today.

565
00:35:56,069 --> 00:35:57,514
Did something happen?

566
00:35:57,538 --> 00:35:58,939
Well,

567
00:35:58,978 --> 00:36:02,108
your mother visited
with Ma Ri's mother.

568
00:36:04,518 --> 00:36:05,818
What?

569
00:36:11,058 --> 00:36:14,258
Where... Where's our Do Ra?

570
00:36:23,768 --> 00:36:26,738
Mom, what did you say to Do Ra?

571
00:36:27,208 --> 00:36:28,838
Where did you send her?

572
00:36:29,569 --> 00:36:31,979
Where would I send her off to?

573
00:36:32,509 --> 00:36:34,548
I don't know anything about this.

574
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:36,948
You visited her
in the hospital today.

575
00:36:37,549 --> 00:36:40,488
What did you say to her
to make her disappear?

576
00:36:42,349 --> 00:36:44,389
Yes, you're right. Soo Yeon and I...

577
00:36:44,389 --> 00:36:46,959
visited her in the hospital today.

578
00:36:47,688 --> 00:36:50,299
But we couldn't say anything
after seeing her like that,

579
00:36:50,299 --> 00:36:52,059
so we came home.

580
00:36:52,228 --> 00:36:53,528
Mom!

581
00:36:54,328 --> 00:36:57,669
Honey, what on earth did you do?

582
00:36:57,768 --> 00:36:59,668
Did you hide Do Ra somewhere?

583
00:36:59,668 --> 00:37:01,538
Where did you take
an injured person?

584
00:37:01,538 --> 00:37:02,538
Tell me this instant.

585
00:37:02,538 --> 00:37:05,608
What do you mean
I made her disappear?

586
00:37:06,748 --> 00:37:08,378
Do Ra's mom...

587
00:37:08,578 --> 00:37:11,318
She asked us to help her
take Do Ra away,

588
00:37:11,619 --> 00:37:13,248
so Soo Yeon gave her some money.

589
00:37:13,248 --> 00:37:14,548
What?

590
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:17,988
What did you just say?

591
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:21,459
That's the truth.

592
00:37:21,858 --> 00:37:25,099
Do Ra begged her mother in tears.

593
00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:26,699
She didn't want to burden you...

594
00:37:26,699 --> 00:37:28,968
and asked her mother
to help her disappear.

595
00:37:29,029 --> 00:37:31,199
Do Ra's mother wanted to honor that,

596
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:32,769
so how could we stop her?

597
00:37:32,938 --> 00:37:34,939
That's what they wanted.

598
00:37:35,369 --> 00:37:36,954
Mom!

599
00:37:36,978 --> 00:37:39,708
What did you do to someone...

600
00:37:39,708 --> 00:37:41,649
who isn't well?

601
00:37:42,378 --> 00:37:43,849
That's right.

602
00:37:45,049 --> 00:37:47,488
To be honest,

603
00:37:47,918 --> 00:37:50,689
I was grateful
she suggested it first.

604
00:37:51,288 --> 00:37:54,059
I didn't hide her anywhere.

605
00:37:54,259 --> 00:37:56,188
Her mother wanted to leave with her.

606
00:37:56,188 --> 00:37:58,198
What could I do about that?

607
00:38:00,628 --> 00:38:03,939
It's not like I am at ease
with any of this.

608
00:38:07,339 --> 00:38:08,639
Besides,

609
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:12,584
Do Ra was adamant about leaving you.

610
00:38:12,608 --> 00:38:15,084
She wanted to end things with you.

611
00:38:15,108 --> 00:38:19,048
Pil Seung,
it's about time you gave up.

612
00:38:19,279 --> 00:38:22,088
Forget about her and move on!

613
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:25,059
Mom.

614
00:38:26,659 --> 00:38:30,798
I never thought
you'd hurt me this badly.

615
00:38:31,858 --> 00:38:33,158
Pil Seung...

616
00:38:35,168 --> 00:38:36,599
My gosh.

617
00:38:37,139 --> 00:38:41,238
Honey. You are one cruel woman.

618
00:38:41,268 --> 00:38:43,878
You always said
we should divorce, right?

619
00:38:43,878 --> 00:38:45,739
That's exactly what we'll do.

620
00:38:45,739 --> 00:38:47,308
I'll see you
at the courthouse tomorrow!

621
00:38:47,308 --> 00:38:48,449
Honey,

622
00:38:48,449 --> 00:38:51,819
I did what was best for Pil Seung...

623
00:38:51,819 --> 00:38:53,288
Don't say this was for his sake...

624
00:38:53,288 --> 00:38:55,749
when he left in tears.

625
00:38:56,049 --> 00:38:58,489
How can you even say that...

626
00:38:58,489 --> 00:39:00,758
when he's shedding tears of blood?

627
00:39:00,929 --> 00:39:02,258
Unbelievable!

628
00:39:06,799 --> 00:39:08,099
My goodness.

629
00:39:09,768 --> 00:39:11,869
Mom, what now?

630
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:13,838
Goodness.

631
00:39:15,865 --> 00:39:19,395
Pil Seung,
did you say that our mom took Do Ra?

632
00:39:19,695 --> 00:39:20,995
Yes.

633
00:39:21,064 --> 00:39:22,635
Try calling Ms. Baek.

634
00:39:22,635 --> 00:39:23,704
She's not taking my calls.

635
00:39:23,704 --> 00:39:26,805
She might at least answer
one of you.

636
00:39:29,744 --> 00:39:31,575
The phone is turned off.

637
00:39:31,575 --> 00:39:34,145
- It's been turned off.
- Please leave a message...

638
00:39:34,474 --> 00:39:36,685
Are you sure our mom took her?

639
00:39:37,744 --> 00:39:39,084
Yes.

640
00:39:39,414 --> 00:39:42,285
It doesn’t make sense
for Do Ra to have gone with her.

641
00:39:44,655 --> 00:39:45,955
Pil Seung,

642
00:39:46,555 --> 00:39:48,355
did our mom ask for money?

643
00:39:55,635 --> 00:39:57,805
Are you kidding me?

644
00:39:57,865 --> 00:40:00,775
What... What's going on?

645
00:40:00,775 --> 00:40:02,405
Mom, it's nothing.

646
00:40:02,405 --> 00:40:04,474
I pulled a prank on Do Jun,

647
00:40:04,474 --> 00:40:06,615
and he was being a baby about it.

648
00:40:06,615 --> 00:40:08,314
Why you...

649
00:40:08,314 --> 00:40:12,785
By the way,
is Ji Young not back yet?

650
00:40:13,184 --> 00:40:15,954
Mom, I told you
she was filming in the US.

651
00:40:15,954 --> 00:40:18,385
She won't be back for another month.
I told you that.

652
00:40:18,385 --> 00:40:21,695
Gosh, I miss my Ji Young.

653
00:40:21,695 --> 00:40:22,841
My goodness.

654
00:40:22,865 --> 00:40:24,064
Ji Young...

655
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:26,134
Go back to sleep.

656
00:40:32,775 --> 00:40:34,704
Hello, is this
Saemmul Rehabilitation Center?

657
00:40:34,704 --> 00:40:37,244
Do you have a patient
by the name of Park Do Ra?

658
00:40:37,244 --> 00:40:39,274
Hi, is this
Somang Rehabilitation Center?

659
00:40:39,514 --> 00:40:42,785
Do you have a patient
by the name of Park Do Ra?

660
00:40:42,885 --> 00:40:45,384
You don't? Got it.

661
00:40:48,385 --> 00:40:50,925
Yes, is this
Joy Rehabilitation Center?

662
00:40:50,925 --> 00:40:53,131
Do you have a patient
by the name of Park Do Ra?

663
00:40:53,155 --> 00:40:55,925
- Deal.
- Be kind to me this time.

664
00:40:55,925 --> 00:40:57,064
You should raise.

665
00:40:57,064 --> 00:40:58,924
- I call ten.
- Who wants a smoke?

666
00:40:59,095 --> 00:41:00,564
Are you kidding me with this hand?

667
00:41:00,564 --> 00:41:03,334
- Fold if you have a crappy hand.
- Okay, here we go.

668
00:41:03,334 --> 00:41:04,665
Two for me.

669
00:41:07,704 --> 00:41:09,374
- I'm in.
- Two more.

670
00:41:09,374 --> 00:41:11,105
- I'm in too.
- Good.

671
00:41:11,675 --> 00:41:13,814
- Shoot.
- What a hand. I'm out.

672
00:41:13,814 --> 00:41:15,174
Play on.

673
00:41:22,784 --> 00:41:25,484
Hello, is this
Bada Rehabilitation Center?

674
00:41:25,925 --> 00:41:29,024
Do you have a patient
called Park Do Ra?

675
00:41:33,064 --> 00:41:34,634
Okay, thanks.

676
00:41:41,034 --> 00:41:43,875
What did the police say?
Did you report her missing?

677
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:48,321
They won't take a report
because she left with Mom,

678
00:41:48,345 --> 00:41:50,485
and she wasn't involved in a crime,

679
00:41:50,485 --> 00:41:52,330
so they won't trace
her phone either.

680
00:41:52,354 --> 00:41:54,255
How could they say that...

681
00:41:54,255 --> 00:41:56,424
when she's missing
and we can't reach her?

682
00:41:58,025 --> 00:41:59,925
I asked a friend.

683
00:41:59,925 --> 00:42:03,095
Her phone's turned off,
so it's hard to trace.

684
00:42:03,664 --> 00:42:05,194
Darn it.

685
00:42:09,604 --> 00:42:10,964
Do Sik.

686
00:42:11,834 --> 00:42:13,834
Do you think Mom did that?

687
00:42:15,275 --> 00:42:17,404
She wouldn't do that.

688
00:42:18,144 --> 00:42:19,444
Do what?

689
00:42:21,144 --> 00:42:24,115
We've been calling
all the hospitals we can find,

690
00:42:24,115 --> 00:42:26,254
and no one has heard of Do Ra.

691
00:42:26,555 --> 00:42:27,655
He's wondering...

692
00:42:27,655 --> 00:42:29,654
if Mom took the money
to gamble with.

693
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:32,285
She wouldn't have done that.

694
00:42:32,854 --> 00:42:35,765
Do Sik. What happened to Do Ra?

695
00:42:36,124 --> 00:42:39,134
We need to find Mom.
We must find her.

696
00:42:40,564 --> 00:42:42,035
Shoot.

697
00:42:45,704 --> 00:42:47,134
Here it is.

698
00:42:49,305 --> 00:42:53,145
Hello. It's Do Sik.
I'm Baek Mi Ja's son.

699
00:42:53,675 --> 00:42:55,620
I have a question.

700
00:42:55,644 --> 00:42:59,091
You used to go gambling with my mom.

701
00:42:59,115 --> 00:43:00,830
What are you saying?

702
00:43:00,854 --> 00:43:03,684
I haven't played cards in years.

703
00:43:03,684 --> 00:43:07,370
No, I'm not asking
if you still gamble.

704
00:43:07,394 --> 00:43:11,325
Can you tell me
where you used to gamble at?

705
00:43:11,425 --> 00:43:12,995
Please, ma'am.

706
00:43:15,434 --> 00:43:18,535
- Let's see.
- Here we go.

707
00:43:20,974 --> 00:43:23,274
- It's time for the last...
- Mom!

708
00:43:23,345 --> 00:43:26,415
I'm all-in.

709
00:43:28,215 --> 00:43:29,715
- Hey.
- Who are you?

710
00:43:29,715 --> 00:43:31,884
- Do Sik.
- Where's Do Ra?

711
00:43:32,255 --> 00:43:34,884
Do Ra... Where is she?

712
00:43:35,985 --> 00:43:38,785
What day is it today?
What's the date?

713
00:43:38,825 --> 00:43:40,631
Where is Do Ra?

714
00:43:40,655 --> 00:43:42,564
Hang on.

715
00:43:45,295 --> 00:43:47,095
I'm five days late already.

716
00:43:48,764 --> 00:43:50,404
Where is Do Ra?

717
00:43:50,735 --> 00:43:52,364
Where is she?

718
00:43:53,104 --> 00:43:54,404
Do Ra...

719
00:43:54,534 --> 00:43:56,845
Do Ra? Where is she?

720
00:43:57,045 --> 00:43:58,475
Where is Do Ra?

721
00:44:03,429 --> 00:44:08,549
(Jungsan Clinic)

722
00:44:10,454 --> 00:44:12,125
You can get lost now.

723
00:44:13,055 --> 00:44:15,394
Do Sik. I'm sorry.

724
00:44:15,394 --> 00:44:16,895
Get lost!

725
00:44:19,295 --> 00:44:20,634
Do Sik...

726
00:45:03,445 --> 00:45:04,805
Pil Seung.

727
00:45:05,545 --> 00:45:06,944
Park Do Ra.

728
00:45:09,684 --> 00:45:11,145
What are you doing here?

729
00:45:14,985 --> 00:45:16,325
Pil Seung.

730
00:45:17,854 --> 00:45:19,725
What are you doing here?

731
00:45:22,664 --> 00:45:24,395
Can't you tell?

732
00:45:27,064 --> 00:45:30,105
I tried to run away from you.

733
00:45:31,564 --> 00:45:34,705
Why did you come all the way here?

734
00:45:39,675 --> 00:45:42,575
Now I have to try to get away
from you again.

735
00:45:48,284 --> 00:45:50,455
Do you want to leave me that badly?

736
00:45:53,854 --> 00:45:55,424
Yes, I do.

737
00:45:56,664 --> 00:45:58,024
Okay, then.

738
00:46:00,465 --> 00:46:01,895
Then walk.

739
00:46:02,805 --> 00:46:04,364
When you're able to walk...

740
00:46:04,905 --> 00:46:07,004
and run away from me on your own,

741
00:46:07,635 --> 00:46:09,421
then I'll break up with you.

742
00:46:09,445 --> 00:46:10,875
So, walk.

743
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:14,214
If you want to break up
with me, walk.

744
00:46:15,545 --> 00:46:16,944
Until you do,

745
00:46:17,644 --> 00:46:19,285
you can't leave me.

746
00:46:20,385 --> 00:46:21,984
You're stuck with me.

747
00:46:41,305 --> 00:46:42,634
It's okay.

748
00:46:44,204 --> 00:46:45,605
You're okay now.

749
00:46:46,045 --> 00:46:47,544
Come with me.

750
00:46:51,445 --> 00:46:53,385
(Establishing law and order
with humane respect)

751
00:46:59,774 --> 00:47:02,103
Jin Dan. Are you okay?

752
00:47:02,474 --> 00:47:05,513
Someone heard a fight happen
in your cell.

753
00:47:05,914 --> 00:47:07,583
Did someone harass you?

754
00:47:13,283 --> 00:47:15,424
I told you not to talk to me.

755
00:47:17,794 --> 00:47:19,894
How dare you talk
like that to elders...

756
00:47:19,894 --> 00:47:22,640
when we were taught better?

757
00:47:22,664 --> 00:47:24,533
Where are your manners?

758
00:47:24,763 --> 00:47:29,004
Hey. You're the punk
who crippled Park Do Ra, aren't you?

759
00:47:29,204 --> 00:47:30,750
I'm a huge fan.

760
00:47:30,774 --> 00:47:33,819
I spent so much money
to make her a star.

761
00:47:33,843 --> 00:47:35,473
You killed her in one go.

762
00:47:37,343 --> 00:47:38,544
You punks!

763
00:47:38,544 --> 00:47:41,060
- Why are you beating him up?
- Who are you, old man?

764
00:47:41,084 --> 00:47:43,283
Are you his dad or something?

765
00:47:46,823 --> 00:47:48,283
Jin Dan.

766
00:47:50,923 --> 00:47:52,864
You get on my nerves.

767
00:47:53,494 --> 00:47:54,863
- Jin Dan!
- Move.

768
00:47:54,863 --> 00:47:56,239
What's going on here?

769
00:47:56,263 --> 00:47:59,194
You look so much better.
What do you do?

770
00:48:02,133 --> 00:48:03,973
Your food's ready.

771
00:48:04,434 --> 00:48:05,804
My gosh, Ae Kyo.

772
00:48:06,204 --> 00:48:07,549
What are you doing here?

773
00:48:07,573 --> 00:48:09,314
Do you work here?

774
00:48:09,314 --> 00:48:10,790
No.

775
00:48:10,814 --> 00:48:14,183
This is my aunt's restaurant.
I'm helping her out.

776
00:48:15,644 --> 00:48:18,614
Lady. We're too busy
for you to be standing around.

777
00:48:21,084 --> 00:48:23,370
Lady?

778
00:48:23,394 --> 00:48:26,000
There was a rumor
that she got kicked out...

779
00:48:26,024 --> 00:48:29,324
with nothing at all
after her son went to prison.

780
00:48:30,064 --> 00:48:31,464
I don't believe this.

781
00:48:32,633 --> 00:48:35,103
Did they have to come and eat here?

782
00:48:35,633 --> 00:48:37,734
Now that they saw me,

783
00:48:38,033 --> 00:48:40,504
they'll tell everyone
I went to school with.

784
00:48:41,073 --> 00:48:43,214
How am I to live now?

785
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:45,890
Ae Kyo.

786
00:48:45,914 --> 00:48:48,183
Hey, Kyung Sook.

787
00:48:49,513 --> 00:48:50,913
Take this.

788
00:48:51,113 --> 00:48:53,724
It's from me and Mi Sook.

789
00:48:53,724 --> 00:48:56,824
- You don't have to.
- Keep it.

790
00:48:57,323 --> 00:48:58,824
You need all the money you can get.

791
00:48:59,294 --> 00:49:01,123
Stay strong, Ae Kyo.

792
00:49:01,363 --> 00:49:03,634
You'll find a way out.

793
00:49:03,994 --> 00:49:06,263
Don't mind us and go back to work.

794
00:49:10,803 --> 00:49:13,973
This is all Jin Sang Gu's fault.

795
00:49:14,604 --> 00:49:17,444
If he hadn't come back
from the Philippines...

796
00:49:18,573 --> 00:49:21,444
Jin Dan. What am I to do now?

797
00:49:22,184 --> 00:49:24,683
What will happen to my son?

798
00:49:28,483 --> 00:49:29,824
Oh, no.

799
00:49:33,093 --> 00:49:35,763
- Here you go.
- Okay.

800
00:49:36,363 --> 00:49:38,734
- Don't worry.
- Be careful.

801
00:49:48,774 --> 00:49:50,513
Enjoy your meal.

802
00:49:51,573 --> 00:49:53,184
- Thanks.
- Sure.

803
00:49:53,184 --> 00:49:54,743
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

804
00:49:57,553 --> 00:49:59,013
Hey.

805
00:49:59,724 --> 00:50:03,393
Serving food is hard work.
Can you sit here and wipe spoons?

806
00:50:03,954 --> 00:50:06,664
But I want to serve food.

807
00:50:06,664 --> 00:50:08,124
It's so much fun.

808
00:50:08,124 --> 00:50:10,194
I've never done anything like this.

809
00:50:10,934 --> 00:50:13,040
I won't mess up.

810
00:50:13,064 --> 00:50:16,473
Will you let me work out here
in the hall?

811
00:50:16,533 --> 00:50:17,974
Boss, please.

812
00:50:17,974 --> 00:50:20,944
I'm not the boss. My brother is.

813
00:50:21,244 --> 00:50:22,319
Is it that much fun?

814
00:50:22,343 --> 00:50:24,020
Yes. I want to do it again.

815
00:50:24,044 --> 00:50:26,884
Will you let me? Please?

816
00:50:27,684 --> 00:50:29,684
Why stop her when she's good at it?

817
00:50:29,684 --> 00:50:31,589
Ma Ri, thanks for your help.

818
00:50:31,613 --> 00:50:34,223
Sure. I'll do my very best.

819
00:50:35,624 --> 00:50:36,924
Welcome.

820
00:50:37,093 --> 00:50:39,194
Welcome. Sit over here.

821
00:50:45,064 --> 00:50:49,063
- My gosh. It smells lovely.
- I told you, didn't I?

822
00:50:51,033 --> 00:50:54,103
- Ma Ri, you might trip up.
- What got into you?

823
00:50:54,774 --> 00:50:57,573
Mom, Dad. I made money today.

824
00:50:57,573 --> 00:51:00,113
I worked
at Do Jun's kalguksu restaurant...

825
00:51:00,113 --> 00:51:02,954
and got paid 50 dollars for my work.

826
00:51:02,954 --> 00:51:05,913
What? You earned money?

827
00:51:05,983 --> 00:51:09,353
What did you do to get paid
at the kalguksu diner?

828
00:51:09,624 --> 00:51:10,653
I waited tables.

829
00:51:10,653 --> 00:51:12,524
- What?
- Some customers even said...

830
00:51:12,524 --> 00:51:14,739
I was nice and kind.

831
00:51:14,763 --> 00:51:16,863
What? Are you serious?

832
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:18,169
Yes, I'm serious.

833
00:51:18,193 --> 00:51:21,604
Ma Ri, you know
kalguksu is served hot.

834
00:51:21,604 --> 00:51:23,803
What if you get scalded
or something?

835
00:51:23,803 --> 00:51:25,004
I'm good at this.

836
00:51:25,004 --> 00:51:27,073
Do Jun and Do Sik said...

837
00:51:27,073 --> 00:51:28,774
a lot of good things about me today.

838
00:51:28,774 --> 00:51:31,644
Mom, Dad,
I find this job really fun.

839
00:51:31,644 --> 00:51:32,814
I want to do it again tomorrow.

840
00:51:32,814 --> 00:51:34,783
No, Ma Ri. You can't do that.

841
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:37,854
Come on. She seems to like it a lot.
Just let her do it.

842
00:51:37,854 --> 00:51:40,754
Ma Ri, you should be careful though.

843
00:51:40,754 --> 00:51:43,454
If you get hurt,
your mom and dad will be really sad.

844
00:51:43,454 --> 00:51:44,624
He's right.

845
00:51:44,624 --> 00:51:45,724
Okay.

846
00:51:45,724 --> 00:51:49,164
Oh, right.
I bought some gifts for you.

847
00:51:49,164 --> 00:51:51,194
- What? You bought us gifts?
- What?

848
00:51:52,733 --> 00:51:55,104
People say
I'm supposed to buy you...

849
00:51:55,104 --> 00:51:58,173
red thermal underwear
with my first salary.

850
00:51:58,173 --> 00:52:00,744
But I didn't make that much money.

851
00:52:00,744 --> 00:52:03,113
- So I bought red socks instead.
- What?

852
00:52:03,113 --> 00:52:04,873
Here, Mom.

853
00:52:05,073 --> 00:52:07,314
- Thank you, Ma Ri.
- My gosh.

854
00:52:07,314 --> 00:52:09,614
- I hope you like it.
- Great.

855
00:52:10,713 --> 00:52:12,053
Of course.

856
00:52:12,053 --> 00:52:14,254
You bought this
with the money you made yourself.

857
00:52:14,254 --> 00:52:15,553
You have to wear them.

858
00:52:15,553 --> 00:52:17,254
Okay. We have matching socks.

859
00:52:17,254 --> 00:52:19,193
- Thanks, Ma Ri.
- What?

860
00:52:19,193 --> 00:52:21,524
- Did something good happen?
- Yes.

861
00:52:22,423 --> 00:52:24,033
Here. This is for you.

862
00:52:24,033 --> 00:52:25,694
What is this?

863
00:52:26,403 --> 00:52:28,504
What? They are socks.

864
00:52:29,263 --> 00:52:31,604
Ma Ri worked part-time today,

865
00:52:31,604 --> 00:52:33,950
so she bought us gifts
with the money she made.

866
00:52:33,974 --> 00:52:35,504
What?

867
00:52:36,274 --> 00:52:39,073
You worked part-time and made money?

868
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:40,683
My goodness.

869
00:52:41,144 --> 00:52:43,614
- Aren't these pretty?
- How sweet.

870
00:52:44,053 --> 00:52:46,384
Thank you so much.

871
00:52:46,624 --> 00:52:48,724
They are warm and comfortable.

872
00:52:48,724 --> 00:52:51,724
Look at us. We are wearing...

873
00:52:51,724 --> 00:52:53,600
- matching socks.
- They're matching socks.

874
00:52:53,624 --> 00:52:56,194
I'm going to work
in these socks tomorrow.

875
00:52:56,334 --> 00:52:57,394
Are you serious?

876
00:52:57,394 --> 00:53:01,233
Of course. Our daughter bought them
with her first salary.

877
00:53:01,233 --> 00:53:03,603
I'll wear them
and tell people about it.

878
00:53:04,374 --> 00:53:07,774
Ma Ri did choose pretty socks.

879
00:53:08,274 --> 00:53:09,513
I'm glad...

880
00:53:09,513 --> 00:53:13,143
that Ma Ri is
with a nice guy like Do Jun,

881
00:53:15,414 --> 00:53:19,513
but his mother, Baek Mi Ja,
still bothers me.

882
00:53:20,854 --> 00:53:23,353
She's just despicable.

883
00:53:24,693 --> 00:53:26,763
I also like everything about Do Jun,

884
00:53:26,763 --> 00:53:28,593
but that's the only thing
that bothers me.

885
00:53:28,593 --> 00:53:30,263
And Park Do Ra too.

886
00:53:30,633 --> 00:53:33,103
Why does a woman like her
have to be their mom?

887
00:53:33,834 --> 00:53:37,004
Why did you give her money
when you knew all that?

888
00:53:37,974 --> 00:53:41,874
She used her injured daughter
to get some money from you,

889
00:53:41,874 --> 00:53:44,414
and you gave her money
to split them up.

890
00:53:44,414 --> 00:53:45,774
You are no different from her.

891
00:53:47,713 --> 00:53:52,183
Sun Young and you were
completely wrong about that.

892
00:53:53,383 --> 00:53:57,124
Honey, I know it was my mistake.

893
00:53:57,124 --> 00:53:58,953
I have no excuse.

894
00:53:59,354 --> 00:54:02,524
Apart from anything else,

895
00:54:02,724 --> 00:54:05,834
I just admire
how Pil Seung loves one person...

896
00:54:05,834 --> 00:54:08,933
and keeps faith with her.

897
00:54:10,633 --> 00:54:13,274
Our son is such a great person.

898
00:54:13,604 --> 00:54:16,103
I wasn't wrong about him.

899
00:54:17,544 --> 00:54:19,483
If the same thing happened to you,

900
00:54:19,483 --> 00:54:22,344
I wouldn't give up on you either.

901
00:54:24,883 --> 00:54:26,214
Honey.

902
00:54:27,553 --> 00:54:31,324
Of course, I feel bad for him
as his father.

903
00:54:31,894 --> 00:54:33,664
But that's Pil Seung's choice.

904
00:54:33,664 --> 00:54:35,294
There's nothing we can do about it.

905
00:54:35,593 --> 00:54:36,933
So,

906
00:54:38,193 --> 00:54:42,063
you should talk to Sun Young too.

907
00:54:43,374 --> 00:54:46,203
Okay. I will.

908
00:54:46,504 --> 00:54:49,603
I'm glad
you like the revised script.

909
00:54:50,044 --> 00:54:52,883
I was afraid...

910
00:54:52,883 --> 00:54:54,520
you might not like it.

911
00:54:54,544 --> 00:54:56,359
The first draft was good too,

912
00:54:56,383 --> 00:54:58,283
but the revision
made the story richer,

913
00:54:58,283 --> 00:55:00,884
and it has a faster pace,
so I liked it even better.

914
00:55:01,354 --> 00:55:04,154
I think we can move on
to the third episode now.

915
00:55:04,754 --> 00:55:08,464
Okay. I'll give you a call
when it's done.

916
00:55:13,903 --> 00:55:15,709
I should get going then.

917
00:55:15,733 --> 00:55:17,234
Wait.

918
00:55:20,274 --> 00:55:22,603
Ms. Ko, this is for you.

919
00:55:23,914 --> 00:55:25,274
What is this?

920
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:29,013
It's nothing special.
They are earrings.

921
00:55:30,314 --> 00:55:31,883
I was passing by a store...

922
00:55:31,883 --> 00:55:34,683
and thought
they would look nice on you.

923
00:55:40,593 --> 00:55:43,464
I don't think
you bought them on a whim.

924
00:55:44,233 --> 00:55:46,234
This is Bulgaria.

925
00:55:47,033 --> 00:55:48,933
Why are you giving them to me?

926
00:55:49,633 --> 00:55:51,333
Ms. Ko,

927
00:55:51,573 --> 00:55:53,950
are you seeing anyone now?

928
00:55:53,974 --> 00:55:55,274
What?

929
00:55:56,713 --> 00:56:00,183
To be honest,
I fell for you when I first met you.

930
00:56:00,483 --> 00:56:01,843
You're so beautiful.

931
00:56:01,843 --> 00:56:03,983
But since we were working together,

932
00:56:03,983 --> 00:56:06,113
I wanted to be careful,
so I didn't express my feelings.

933
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:07,524
But...

934
00:56:08,254 --> 00:56:11,924
I've never done this before,
so I don't know what to do.

935
00:56:12,193 --> 00:56:13,864
Do you want to go out with me?

936
00:56:14,923 --> 00:56:17,694
Well... Director.

937
00:56:40,624 --> 00:56:41,984
I'm sorry.

938
00:56:42,584 --> 00:56:44,893
I have a boyfriend.

939
00:56:46,524 --> 00:56:48,263
I see.

940
00:56:48,923 --> 00:56:51,033
I made a big mistake.

941
00:56:51,633 --> 00:56:53,134
No.

942
00:56:54,963 --> 00:56:58,404
Still, I'd like you
to accept the earrings.

943
00:56:59,233 --> 00:57:02,944
I'm giving you these
because I like and admire your work.

944
00:57:04,213 --> 00:57:08,083
You can just think
they are from your friend.

945
00:57:10,383 --> 00:57:11,853
Ms. Ko.

946
00:57:14,483 --> 00:57:16,283
I'm so sorry.

947
00:58:23,394 --> 00:58:24,924
To be honest,

948
00:58:25,323 --> 00:58:27,664
I fell for you when I first met you.

949
00:58:27,664 --> 00:58:28,963
You're so beautiful.

950
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:31,133
But since we were working together,

951
00:58:31,133 --> 00:58:33,204
I wanted to be careful,
so I didn't express my feelings.

952
00:58:33,204 --> 00:58:34,563
But...

953
00:58:35,363 --> 00:58:39,250
I've never done this before,
so I don't know what to do.

954
00:58:39,274 --> 00:58:40,973
Do you want to go out with me?

955
00:58:41,903 --> 00:58:43,774
My goodness.

956
00:58:48,565 --> 00:58:50,298
(My Love Ddo Sik)

957
00:58:52,674 --> 00:58:54,302
(My Love Ddo Sik)

958
00:59:05,886 --> 00:59:07,316
Yes, it's me.

959
00:59:09,556 --> 00:59:10,925
Now?

960
00:59:11,625 --> 00:59:13,726
You have something important to say?

961
00:59:19,625 --> 00:59:22,095
Okay. I'll see you now.

962
00:59:22,165 --> 00:59:23,865
I also have something to say.

963
00:59:32,605 --> 00:59:34,675
What is the important thing
you want to say?

964
00:59:40,485 --> 00:59:42,055
I think we should stop
seeing each other.

965
00:59:44,855 --> 00:59:46,385
What?

966
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:49,195
I saw you earlier today...

967
00:59:49,556 --> 00:59:51,566
with another man at a cafe.

968
00:59:52,665 --> 00:59:54,336
You like him, don't you?

969
00:59:58,766 --> 01:00:00,276
Well...

970
01:00:03,145 --> 01:00:05,845
I felt betrayed and upset at first.

971
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:09,075
Then I realized
that I had been uncaring.

972
01:00:10,516 --> 01:00:12,215
I was too busy to meet you,

973
01:00:12,215 --> 01:00:14,055
but I forced you to stay with me.

974
01:00:14,956 --> 01:00:16,285
I'm sorry.

975
01:00:19,085 --> 01:00:20,655
No, Do Sik.

976
01:00:22,255 --> 01:00:23,796
I'm sorry.

977
01:00:26,226 --> 01:00:28,196
I really want you to be happy.

978
01:00:28,196 --> 01:00:29,865
I mean it.

979
01:00:32,206 --> 01:00:33,776
I should get going then.

980
01:00:34,335 --> 01:00:35,976
Take care.

981
01:01:13,946 --> 01:01:15,246
Pil Seung.

982
01:01:16,246 --> 01:01:18,722
I can't do it anymore.
I'm done for the day.

983
01:01:18,746 --> 01:01:22,256
Do Ra, just a bit more.
You're halfway there.

984
01:01:22,786 --> 01:01:24,126
Pil Seung.

985
01:01:24,656 --> 01:01:27,125
My arms carried me this far,

986
01:01:27,125 --> 01:01:29,456
not my legs.

987
01:01:29,625 --> 01:01:31,972
I didn't actually walk.

988
01:01:31,996 --> 01:01:35,211
Yes, Do Ra. You may be relying on
your arms and me right now,

989
01:01:35,235 --> 01:01:38,211
but you'll be able to walk
once you put in the work.

990
01:01:38,235 --> 01:01:40,182
So stay strong for me.

991
01:01:40,206 --> 01:01:41,411
You've got this.

992
01:01:41,435 --> 01:01:43,351
I've been trying my hardest.

993
01:01:43,375 --> 01:01:45,052
I did the best I could,

994
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:47,515
but I still can't walk.

995
01:01:47,946 --> 01:01:50,345
Nothing's working.

996
01:01:51,085 --> 01:01:53,855
Do Ra, you couldn't even stand
like this before,

997
01:01:53,855 --> 01:01:55,391
but look at you now.

998
01:01:55,415 --> 01:01:57,425
You can move
as long as you can grab the bars.

999
01:01:58,025 --> 01:02:00,501
No, I can't. I can't.

1000
01:02:00,525 --> 01:02:01,856
Do Ra.

1001
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:06,996
Pil Seung.

1002
01:02:08,335 --> 01:02:11,765
I can't stand properly
if I let go like this.

1003
01:02:13,105 --> 01:02:15,776
There's nothing I can do.

1004
01:02:19,176 --> 01:02:23,015
I need to walk
if I'm to break up with you.

1005
01:02:23,045 --> 01:02:25,616
That's why I want to walk,

1006
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:29,186
but I can't.

1007
01:02:30,426 --> 01:02:33,356
I can't do this anymore.

1008
01:02:35,125 --> 01:02:36,456
Pil Seung.

1009
01:02:38,196 --> 01:02:40,365
Let's please end it.

1010
01:02:41,935 --> 01:02:44,235
Break up with me.

1011
01:02:45,406 --> 01:02:48,076
It must be killing you to see me
like this,

1012
01:02:48,076 --> 01:02:50,405
and seeing you leaves me in agony.

1013
01:02:50,875 --> 01:02:53,615
I'm suffering to the point
that I want to die.

1014
01:02:54,016 --> 01:02:56,575
So please, just leave.

1015
01:02:57,045 --> 01:02:59,916
Okay? Leave me.

1016
01:03:00,056 --> 01:03:01,916
Leave me.

1017
01:03:02,956 --> 01:03:05,526
Please leave me!

1018
01:03:05,656 --> 01:03:07,256
Leave me!

1019
01:03:07,525 --> 01:03:09,496
Leave me.

1020
01:03:09,996 --> 01:03:11,365
Do Ra.

1021
01:03:13,266 --> 01:03:14,965
I told you before...

1022
01:03:16,935 --> 01:03:18,965
that whether it is the past,

1023
01:03:19,505 --> 01:03:21,075
present, or future,

1024
01:03:22,735 --> 01:03:24,805
I couldn't live without you.

1025
01:03:27,116 --> 01:03:29,215
That's why
I can't break up with you.

1026
01:03:32,585 --> 01:03:34,655
You can push me away all you want,

1027
01:03:37,185 --> 01:03:39,555
but I will still stick to you
like gum.

1028
01:03:58,145 --> 01:04:00,121
Did you hear about the nation's gum?

1029
01:04:00,145 --> 01:04:02,246
The nation's gum? What's that?

1030
01:04:02,375 --> 01:04:04,346
Haven't you watched this video?

1031
01:04:04,346 --> 01:04:06,661
Park Do Ra was
with her boyfriend at the hospital.

1032
01:04:06,685 --> 01:04:09,032
You know,
that Director Ko Pil Seung.

1033
01:04:09,056 --> 01:04:11,156
She wanted to break up with him
since she couldn't walk...

1034
01:04:11,156 --> 01:04:12,886
and told him to leave.

1035
01:04:12,886 --> 01:04:14,556
But Director Ko said...

1036
01:04:14,556 --> 01:04:16,156
he wouldn't leave her...

1037
01:04:16,156 --> 01:04:18,565
and vowed to stick to her like gum.

1038
01:04:18,565 --> 01:04:21,141
No way. What a hopeless romantic!

1039
01:04:21,165 --> 01:04:24,036
Now, Director Ko is known
as Mr. Romantic...

1040
01:04:24,036 --> 01:04:26,006
and the nation's gum.

1041
01:04:29,806 --> 01:04:31,581
You can push me away all you want,

1042
01:04:31,605 --> 01:04:33,722
but I will still stick to you
like gum.

1043
01:04:33,746 --> 01:04:35,976
Do Ra, accept the love of Mr. Gum.

1044
01:04:35,976 --> 01:04:37,145
Don't get rid of your gum.

1045
01:04:37,145 --> 01:04:39,815
Do Ra, film another masterpiece
with Mr. Gum.

1046
01:04:39,815 --> 01:04:42,315
"Seoul Lady" filmed
by Director Gum is the bomb.

1047
01:04:42,315 --> 01:04:44,426
Park Do Ra was compelling
in "Seoul Lady."

1048
01:04:44,426 --> 01:04:45,702
"Seoul Lady" is a masterpiece.

1049
01:04:45,726 --> 01:04:46,996
I'm late to the party,
but I've been binge-watching it.

1050
01:04:46,996 --> 01:04:48,756
So please, just leave.

1051
01:04:49,926 --> 01:04:51,796
Leave me.

1052
01:04:52,165 --> 01:04:54,065
- Please leave me!
- What the...

1053
01:04:54,065 --> 01:04:55,465
Is Pil Seung being this way...

1054
01:04:55,465 --> 01:04:58,305
when Do Ra wants
to end their relationship?

1055
01:04:58,766 --> 01:05:01,175
This is killing me.

1056
01:05:02,676 --> 01:05:04,976
Should he break up with her...

1057
01:05:05,076 --> 01:05:08,816
and turn her back on her
when she can't walk?

1058
01:05:09,875 --> 01:05:11,746
Imagine if it were you.

1059
01:05:11,746 --> 01:05:13,786
Should I leave you...

1060
01:05:13,786 --> 01:05:15,956
if you can't walk?

1061
01:05:16,556 --> 01:05:18,856
You shouldn't be this way...

1062
01:05:19,185 --> 01:05:21,456
when their story is this sad.

1063
01:05:21,496 --> 01:05:23,595
- Darn.
- What?

1064
01:05:24,465 --> 01:05:27,095
What on earth...

1065
01:05:27,196 --> 01:05:30,735
Why is he angry
when Sun Young barely said anything?

1066
01:05:31,165 --> 01:05:33,166
Mom, Sun Young,

1067
01:05:33,636 --> 01:05:34,906
I don't think...

1068
01:05:34,906 --> 01:05:36,782
Pil Seung can ever break up
with Do Ra.

1069
01:05:36,806 --> 01:05:38,805
It's about time you gave up.

1070
01:05:39,875 --> 01:05:42,222
Of course, they can still break up.

1071
01:05:42,246 --> 01:05:45,291
He should leave her
when Do Ra wants to end this.

1072
01:05:45,315 --> 01:05:46,915
This is the perfect moment.

1073
01:05:46,915 --> 01:05:49,432
Mom, didn't you see the video?

1074
01:05:49,456 --> 01:05:50,985
The entire nation...

1075
01:05:50,985 --> 01:05:53,855
is supporting him
as the nation's Mr. Romantic,

1076
01:05:53,855 --> 01:05:55,526
so how can they break up?

1077
01:05:56,156 --> 01:05:57,796
By any chance,

1078
01:05:58,295 --> 01:06:00,396
if he leaves Do Ra,

1079
01:06:01,665 --> 01:06:05,865
he'll be branded
as the nation's traitor.

1080
01:06:06,406 --> 01:06:08,006
The nation's traitor?

1081
01:06:08,306 --> 01:06:09,911
Myung Dong, please.

1082
01:06:09,935 --> 01:06:12,605
Come on. Should that scare him
into staying...

1083
01:06:12,605 --> 01:06:15,776
with Do Ra all her life
when she can't walk?

1084
01:06:15,915 --> 01:06:18,215
Being together is easier said
than done,

1085
01:06:18,215 --> 01:06:20,655
and not just anyone can do that.

1086
01:06:21,485 --> 01:06:22,916
Anyway,

1087
01:06:23,056 --> 01:06:25,831
Park Do Ra is just as annoying.

1088
01:06:25,855 --> 01:06:29,472
Why can't she just let him be there
when that's what he wants?

1089
01:06:29,496 --> 01:06:31,796
Instead, she keeps telling him
to leave and break up with her.

1090
01:06:31,926 --> 01:06:34,735
Must she break his heart like that?

1091
01:06:34,996 --> 01:06:36,365
Darn it.

1092
01:06:38,505 --> 01:06:39,906
We'll strongly consider it, then.

1093
01:06:39,906 --> 01:06:41,476
Sure. Have a good day.

1094
01:06:47,446 --> 01:06:48,916
Mr. Ko.

1095
01:06:49,076 --> 01:06:51,316
It's big.

1096
01:06:51,485 --> 01:06:53,956
What is it? What's going on?

1097
01:06:54,056 --> 01:06:57,001
Europe, Southeast Asia,
North America, and...

1098
01:06:57,025 --> 01:07:00,061
I mean,
every country across the world...

1099
01:07:00,085 --> 01:07:02,672
wants to air "Seoul Lady."

1100
01:07:02,696 --> 01:07:04,771
We're being bombarded
with inquiries.

1101
01:07:04,795 --> 01:07:06,095
What?

1102
01:07:07,136 --> 01:07:08,666
"Seoul Lady?"

1103
01:07:09,866 --> 01:07:11,805
How did that happen out of the blue?

1104
01:07:12,335 --> 01:07:14,306
You vowing
to stick to her like gum...

1105
01:07:14,306 --> 01:07:17,146
touched the hearts of Koreans...

1106
01:07:17,206 --> 01:07:18,521
and everyone else around the world.

1107
01:07:18,545 --> 01:07:21,851
That led to "Seoul Lady"
having a major resurgence.

1108
01:07:21,875 --> 01:07:24,186
It's all thanks to you.

1109
01:07:25,516 --> 01:07:26,885
What?

1110
01:07:27,656 --> 01:07:30,586
Anyway, that's great news.

1111
01:07:30,886 --> 01:07:34,001
Tell everyone to gather.
We're late to the party,

1112
01:07:34,025 --> 01:07:36,601
but we'll try to increase the sales.

1113
01:07:36,625 --> 01:07:38,242
Call for an urgent meeting.

1114
01:07:38,266 --> 01:07:40,666
Of course. Sure thing, sir.

1115
01:07:44,706 --> 01:07:46,066
No way.

1116
01:08:00,855 --> 01:08:02,686
I can't.

1117
01:08:03,215 --> 01:08:04,926
Pil Seung, I can't.

1118
01:08:04,926 --> 01:08:06,285
Do Ra.

1119
01:08:06,855 --> 01:08:08,226
Do Ra.

1120
01:08:08,956 --> 01:08:10,256
Do Ra, look at this.

1121
01:08:12,496 --> 01:08:15,396
You are being supported
not only by fans in Korea...

1122
01:08:16,165 --> 01:08:18,135
but by those overseas.

1123
01:08:19,465 --> 01:08:22,005
- Do Ra, I miss you.
- Do Ra, come back to us.

1124
01:08:22,005 --> 01:08:23,406
Get well soon
and star in a new project.

1125
01:08:23,406 --> 01:08:24,805
Do Ra, I love you.

1126
01:08:31,786 --> 01:08:33,586
Many are waiting for you...

1127
01:08:34,855 --> 01:08:36,716
to make a comeback on the screen.

1128
01:08:46,626 --> 01:08:48,035
Pil Seung...

1129
01:08:49,235 --> 01:08:50,605
I'll...

1130
01:08:50,966 --> 01:08:53,006
I'll try again.

1131
01:08:53,435 --> 01:08:55,306
Sure. Let's do that.

1132
01:09:02,015 --> 01:09:04,815
One, two, three.

1133
01:09:07,456 --> 01:09:09,216
- Are you grabbing them?
- Yes.

1134
01:09:26,765 --> 01:09:28,105
Do Ra!

1135
01:09:29,876 --> 01:09:31,346
Do Ra, are you all right?

1136
01:09:32,645 --> 01:09:34,016
Do Ra.

1137
01:09:35,076 --> 01:09:37,145
As if I can do this.

1138
01:09:37,485 --> 01:09:39,145
As if!

1139
01:09:41,855 --> 01:09:43,216
Do Ra.

1140
01:09:44,485 --> 01:09:46,325
Do you want to see what I've become?

1141
01:09:51,166 --> 01:09:52,496
Do Ra...

1142
01:09:53,265 --> 01:09:55,735
Do Ra.

1143
01:10:05,946 --> 01:10:08,645
I can't even stand, let alone walk.

1144
01:10:08,645 --> 01:10:10,416
How can I possibly get better?

1145
01:10:10,586 --> 01:10:12,886
What can I even do?

1146
01:10:14,355 --> 01:10:17,831
So, stop giving me false hope.

1147
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:21,155
You should stop
getting your hopes up as well.

1148
01:10:22,296 --> 01:10:23,756
Fine.

1149
01:10:24,565 --> 01:10:26,025
We'll end it.

1150
01:10:27,235 --> 01:10:29,296
Tolerating this negative attitude
is worse...

1151
01:10:29,796 --> 01:10:31,806
than seeing you handicapped anyway.

1152
01:10:32,166 --> 01:10:33,766
I'm fed up with it!

1153
01:10:34,105 --> 01:10:37,006
That's right. Let's end it.

1154
01:10:37,275 --> 01:10:38,846
Just end it.

1155
01:10:39,645 --> 01:10:42,546
There's no need for you
to try this hard!

1156
01:11:00,565 --> 01:11:01,966
Do Ra...

1157
01:11:05,966 --> 01:11:07,376
Look at you.

1158
01:11:15,576 --> 01:11:16,975
Do Ra.

1159
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:21,397
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1160
01:11:46,547 --> 01:11:48,448
Do Jun is getting engaged? To whom?

1161
01:11:48,448 --> 01:11:50,448
Why do you care
whether I get engaged or not?

1162
01:11:50,448 --> 01:11:51,957
That means you'll get married.

1163
01:11:51,957 --> 01:11:54,788
You should talk to your mom
about things like that.

1164
01:11:54,788 --> 01:11:56,158
Get out so I can close up the shop.

1165
01:11:56,158 --> 01:11:57,328
Park Do Jun's mom?

1166
01:11:57,328 --> 01:11:59,603
What brings you here?

1167
01:11:59,627 --> 01:12:01,597
Do Sik. Why are we here?

1168
01:12:01,597 --> 01:12:02,728
It's scary.

1169
01:12:02,728 --> 01:12:05,613
Why did we come here
in the dead of night?

1170
01:12:05,637 --> 01:12:08,307
Do Ra wanted to break up with him.

1171
01:12:08,307 --> 01:12:11,038
You must be so pleased
that you got your way.

1172
01:12:11,038 --> 01:12:14,078
You and Sun Young
need to clean this up.

1173
01:12:14,108 --> 01:12:15,547
Mother.

1174
01:12:15,707 --> 01:12:18,918
Do you really mean that?
