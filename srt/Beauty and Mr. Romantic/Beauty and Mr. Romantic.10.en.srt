1
00:00:00,104 --> 00:00:07,465
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,250
Oh, right.

3
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:15,059
I met Pil Seung earlier today.

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,999
What? Why did you meet him?

5
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:22,999
Why is that so surprising?

6
00:00:23,299 --> 00:00:25,200
Am I not supposed to see him?

7
00:00:26,669 --> 00:00:29,770
Well... It's not like that.

8
00:00:30,709 --> 00:00:34,649
But why would you meet Pil Seung?
How did you meet him?

9
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:36,680
Did you call him?

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,779
How would I call him
when I didn't even have his number?

11
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,419
I just ran into him.

12
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,059
He was filming a drama
in front of my office today.

13
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:48,730
So we had some tea together.
I was glad to see him.

14
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,429
I see.

15
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,970
By the way,
he seems like a nice guy.

16
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,599
The more I see him,
the more I like him.

17
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:03,169
You do?

18
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,679
So I was thinking, honey...

19
00:01:09,679 --> 00:01:13,349
What do you think of Pil Seung
as Ma Ri's spouse?

20
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:16,149
What?

21
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:21,429
What are you talking about?

22
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:24,429
Ma Ri's spouse?

23
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,160
You know,

24
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,170
I like Pil Seung so much.

25
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,569
Honey.

26
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:35,910
I only saw him a few times,
but for some strange reason,

27
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:39,310
I find him so reliable
and trustworthy.

28
00:01:41,349 --> 00:01:43,880
Plus, he's the son
of your friend Sun Young,

29
00:01:44,949 --> 00:01:47,920
so we can trust him
and his background even more.

30
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,089
A man like Pil Seung...

31
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,890
could take good care of our Ma Ri.

32
00:01:56,989 --> 00:01:58,530
Why don't you...

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,929
ask your friend Sun Young
what she thinks?

34
00:02:04,699 --> 00:02:07,000
Darling. That's preposterous.

35
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,209
Why? Is it that nonsensical an idea?

36
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,940
Well...

37
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,310
Sun Young...

38
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,549
She practically put her life on hold
to raise her son.

39
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,019
How could you ask me to ask her...

40
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:26,590
to give us her son...

41
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,690
so he can look after our daughter
for the rest of her life?

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,299
That's asking too much on our part.

43
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,240
Is it?

44
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:42,240
Even if I offer to give him
all I own? All we own?

45
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:45,079
Honey.

46
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:48,109
However rich we are
and however much we have,

47
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,210
it's not right to ask a young man...

48
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:54,349
to sacrifice his future
to look after Ma Ri.

49
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,449
I couldn't ask that of Sun Young.

50
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,789
Yes. You're right.
You're very right.

51
00:03:05,829 --> 00:03:07,699
I got a bit too greedy.

52
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,400
Not to mention, honey,
Pil Seung has a girlfriend.

53
00:03:14,539 --> 00:03:16,039
He's seeing someone?

54
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,910
Yes.

55
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,810
I see.

56
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,949
We almost made a grave mistake.

57
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,900
What a dreadful idea.

58
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,870
What has gotten into him?

59
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:52,810
How could he think of
marrying Pil Seung to Ma Ri?

60
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:55,509
That's just nonsense.

61
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,250
Hey.

62
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,690
What's the matter?

63
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:08,859
- Goodness.
- Auntie.

64
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:10,329
Soo Yeon.

65
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:13,259
Why did you jump?

66
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,970
Are you guilty of something?

67
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:18,769
What?

68
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:21,269
I was just kidding.

69
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:24,610
You were talking to yourself,
and then you jumped in surprise.

70
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,310
Are you all right?

71
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,409
Yes. I'm fine.

72
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:34,149
- Do you need something?
- Goodness.

73
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,319
Oh, dear.

74
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:39,959
Madam Cho,
will you give me a minute?

75
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:49,800
What do you mean, Madam Cho?

76
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,839
You can't come tomorrow?

77
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,199
Why not?

78
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,009
The weather here is terrible.

79
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:00,880
The winds were so strong,
that the flights got canceled.

80
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,750
I'll come over as soon as
the weather improves and call you.

81
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,420
Okay, you do that.

82
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,290
Thanks so much. Stay in touch.

83
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,930
Yes. Who cares
if we wait a few days?

84
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,930
Once Jin Taek hears about
that vixen's promiscuous past...

85
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:24,430
from Madam Cho,

86
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,170
he will not let it slide.

87
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:29,009
He'll be sick of her.

88
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,709
He'll be too appalled by her
to keep her in his life.

89
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,110
No, wait.

90
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,019
Did she have the baby then,

91
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,089
keep it hidden somewhere until now,

92
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:46,290
and keep in touch in secret?

93
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,560
- Mother.
- Goodness.

94
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,190
Why do you suddenly want to
stick eyeballs in toys?

95
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,230
We won't make much doing this.

96
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:56,800
I'm trying to earn whatever I can
to contribute to expenses.

97
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,399
My son's doing even harder work
at a construction site.

98
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:04,509
Hey.

99
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:08,680
What's that?

100
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:10,279
Look at him.

101
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:12,920
"Complete moron?"

102
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,050
(I am a complete moron.)

103
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,519
What is a tall guy...

104
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:18,420
doing out in public
with that stuck on his back?

105
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,759
I wonder whose son that is.

106
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:25,259
Good for him, getting so drunk
he can't control himself.

107
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,959
Good for you.

108
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,130
You're right, Mother.

109
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,199
- What a sight.
- Mother.

110
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,540
- What?
- It looks like Pil Seung.

111
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,540
What?

112
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,339
Isn't that our Pil Seung?

113
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:41,310
Why would Pil Seung have
something like that stuck on him?

114
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:44,380
Pil Seung.

115
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:48,550
- Mother, it is Pil Seung.
- Goodness.

116
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,050
- Hey, Pil Seung.
- Hey.

117
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,860
- Wait.
- Pil Seung.

118
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,159
Pil Seung. My goodness.

119
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:56,659
Hey. It's Mom.

120
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,159
And Grandma.

121
00:06:59,529 --> 00:07:01,430
Ko Pil Seung.

122
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:04,230
What's this?

123
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,300
Why do you have this on your back?

124
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,139
What's this?

125
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:10,969
"Complete moron."

126
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,909
"I am a complete moron."

127
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,380
This was on my back?

128
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:22,690
Yes.

129
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:25,159
Who were you with until now?

130
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,319
Who would stick this on your back?

131
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,300
I don't know.
When did I end up with it?

132
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,769
Cheers.

133
00:07:38,769 --> 00:07:42,139
Pil Seung, only be interested
in your work, okay?

134
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,610
I get it.

135
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,449
We had a team dinner.
Someone must've pranked me.

136
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:51,819
- A team dinner?
- Yes.

137
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:54,350
Who would pull a prank like this...

138
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,719
on someone's precious son?

139
00:07:55,719 --> 00:07:58,219
Who would call you a complete moron?

140
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,990
It didn't just say "fool."
It said "complete moron."

141
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:06,659
This is true malice.

142
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,000
You shouldn't let this go.

143
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,240
Do you have anyone in mind?

144
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,240
What? No.

145
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:18,940
Why did you drink so much
you blacked out?

146
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,240
You're a lightweight.

147
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:23,810
Do you know how bad
blacking out is to your health?

148
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,719
Yes. Don't drink too much.
You could make a terrible mistake.

149
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,620
Okay. I'll be careful.

150
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,889
When did our Pil Seung get drunk...

151
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,259
and mess up and insult someone?

152
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:38,630
Why would you even worry about that?

153
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:42,130
This isn't a big deal.
Don't worry about it.

154
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,169
How is this not a big deal?

155
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,240
You need to find out
who did this to you.

156
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,639
Okay, I will.

157
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:54,439
How could he cry about her
15 years later?

158
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:58,279
What? His youth ended
right there and then?

159
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,950
His heart gets torn into pieces?

160
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,659
He used to ride around
on his motorcycle...

161
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:07,320
and get into all sorts of trouble.

162
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,590
He's still a fool
and a troublemaker.

163
00:09:10,189 --> 00:09:12,730
To think that I fell
for Ko Dae Chung.

164
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,059
I was out of my mind.

165
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,399
I'd lost it completely.

166
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:18,539
Darn it!

167
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,370
It's the worst humiliation
in all of my life.

168
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:26,909
Ko Dae Chung. No, Ko Pil Seung.

169
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:31,779
You're out from now on. It's over.

170
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:42,429
(I am a complete moron.)

171
00:09:42,429 --> 00:09:43,490
It's you, right?

172
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,700
What's that?

173
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,299
(What's that?)

174
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,240
You're going to pretend
you don't know?

175
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:02,049
You did this!

176
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,909
My goodness.

177
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,350
Assistant Director Ko.

178
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,649
You can't do this to an actress
in the middle of the night.

179
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,320
Why are you so rude?

180
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,590
From now on, on set,
and even after the shoot,

181
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,289
let's keep things formal,

182
00:10:18,289 --> 00:10:20,159
as actor and assistant director.

183
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,970
And don't send me such texts
in the middle of the night.

184
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,840
Wasn't it Park Do Ra's doing?

185
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,439
Then who did it?

186
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,950
By the way,

187
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,649
why does Do Ra sound so serious?

188
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,389
Did I make a mistake
when I got blackout drunk?

189
00:10:46,289 --> 00:10:47,519
Gosh, I don't care.

190
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:52,230
It didn't just say "fool."
I was called a complete moron.

191
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,799
I'll find whoever wrote this.

192
00:10:56,669 --> 00:10:58,970
I strolled around the neighborhood
with this stuck to my back.

193
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,669
This is so embarrassing.

194
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:04,840
(Night Club)

195
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,480
Seriously, this is...

196
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:12,220
What? Hello, ma'am.

197
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,590
You were here yesterday.
What? Did you forget something?

198
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,820
It's not like that.

199
00:11:17,289 --> 00:11:18,289
Ma'am.

200
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:21,159
Did you see
who stuck this on my back?

201
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:22,389
That one?

202
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:24,730
The lady who was here with you
stuck it.

203
00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:28,000
She asked me for paper and a pen.

204
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:30,470
I knew it. It was her, right?

205
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:33,070
(I am a complete moron.)

206
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:41,710
My heart...

207
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:44,080
gets torn into pieces again.

208
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,580
As if you know anything about love.

209
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,980
As if you know how it feels
to have your heart crushed...

210
00:11:48,789 --> 00:11:50,450
by love.

211
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:03,029
Park Do Ra.

212
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:05,399
Why can't you...

213
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:08,570
stop thinking about
that curly-haired Ko Dae Chung?

214
00:12:09,169 --> 00:12:11,409
Yesterday, you said it was over.

215
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,779
Don't even think about that jerk.

216
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,820
Do Ra.

217
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,220
There's something
I want to say to you.

218
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:29,590
Can we meet up now?

219
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:33,360
Why is he being like this?

220
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,169
What is it he wants to say to me?

221
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,899
Maybe...

222
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,360
Hey,

223
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,029
why did you call me here?

224
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:13,740
What is it you want to say?

225
00:13:17,409 --> 00:13:19,509
What? Do you want
to go to a nightclub?

226
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,980
I told you I didn't do it.

227
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,990
Is that why
you called me out here...

228
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:32,490
when I was busy
working on my script?

229
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,360
Of course.
Why else would I call you out?

230
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,429
I know you did this.

231
00:13:35,429 --> 00:13:36,789
I said it wasn't me.

232
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:38,860
Do you have proof I did it?

233
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,700
Anyway, I'm busy,
so I should get going.

234
00:13:44,269 --> 00:13:46,399
Wait. I do have proof.

235
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,240
You asked me...

236
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,570
for paper, tape,
and a pen yesterday.

237
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,409
Then you wrote that thing...

238
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:56,049
and stuck it on his back.

239
00:13:56,649 --> 00:13:58,450
And as you left,

240
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,580
you asked me
not to tell him about this.

241
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,419
So I didn't say anything.

242
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,590
I thought you were
playing a joke on your boyfriend.

243
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:12,630
Come on, what boyfriend?
I'm telling you we're not together.

244
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,230
Pil Seung.

245
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,700
Did you call me out here
just to make sure?

246
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,539
Of course, I did.
Why else would I see you?

247
00:14:23,169 --> 00:14:24,870
By the way... Hang on.

248
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:27,679
You look somewhat familiar.

249
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,480
Are you a TV celebrity or something?

250
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,049
No, ma'am.

251
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:33,880
Goodbye.

252
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,490
Ma'am, I'll come again later.
Thank you.

253
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,960
Park Do Ra.

254
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:44,090
Why did you do this?

255
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,399
Are you looking down on me
because I'm an assistant director?

256
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:48,100
Am I a joke to you?

257
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:50,029
Or did I do something wrong?

258
00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:52,029
Even if I did,

259
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,340
you can't do this to me.

260
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:57,370
There's a line you shouldn't cross.

261
00:14:57,509 --> 00:14:59,039
You're not
a 12-year-old girl anymore.

262
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:03,110
I had no idea I had this on my back,

263
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,980
and I strolled around
the whole neighborhood.

264
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,049
It made a fool of me.

265
00:15:08,049 --> 00:15:09,649
Even my mom and grandma saw it.

266
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:12,189
Do you know how humiliating it was?

267
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,490
Can you at least tell me why?

268
00:15:16,189 --> 00:15:18,090
Why are you doing this to me?

269
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:21,200
Just tell me
if I did anything wrong.

270
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:29,240
Do you really not know...

271
00:15:30,909 --> 00:15:31,909
why I did this?

272
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,840
I don't know. I really don't.

273
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,480
That's why I'm asking you.

274
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,409
So you are a complete moron.

275
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:40,779
What...

276
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,549
What did you just say?

277
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:44,620
I like you.

278
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,389
I did it because I liked you.

279
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:51,289
What?

280
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:53,730
And think about what you said to me.

281
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:57,269
You said you were still heartbroken
because of Jung Mi.

282
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,100
You even cried.

283
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,210
I, who is beloved...

284
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:05,809
by half of the men in this country,
was sitting in front of you,

285
00:16:05,809 --> 00:16:07,939
but you cried
talking about someone else.

286
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:10,080
How could you do
something so stupid?

287
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,549
That makes you a complete moron.
That's why I did that.

288
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,750
I've been signaling you
time and time again...

289
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,549
regarding my feelings for you.

290
00:16:17,549 --> 00:16:18,850
Only a complete moron...

291
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,159
would be daft enough
not to notice it,

292
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:21,590
you complete moron!

293
00:16:27,929 --> 00:16:29,899
Do Ra, why are you being like this?

294
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:33,500
You're making a joke
to get away with this, right?

295
00:16:34,269 --> 00:16:36,970
Why are you talking nonsense
after I told you the whole thing?

296
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,340
I'm not joking.

297
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,110
I'm really serious now.

298
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:45,380
I really mean it.

299
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:49,919
This isn't a joke,
so hear me loud and clear.

300
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:55,220
I have feelings for you.

301
00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:00,360
Even when I didn't know
you were Dae Chung.

302
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:02,669
I've had a crush on you ever since.

303
00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:06,340
So we should go out
starting from today.

304
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,740
This is our first day
as a couple. Okay?

305
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:12,610
Well...

306
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,580
Do Ra.

307
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,350
I'm sorry, but I should get going.

308
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:19,219
Go home safe.

309
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:23,620
You should answer it first.
You can't just leave like that.

310
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,489
You're my boyfriend now, okay?

311
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,229
I'm not your boyfriend.

312
00:17:34,229 --> 00:17:35,630
I don't have feelings for you.

313
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,600
I don't want to go out with you.

314
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,040
What?

315
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,469
You don't have feelings for me?

316
00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:44,709
You don't want to go out with me?

317
00:17:46,979 --> 00:17:49,580
Did I hear it wrong?

318
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,610
I'm sorry.

319
00:17:51,209 --> 00:17:53,550
I really don't like you.

320
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,719
That can't be true.

321
00:17:57,389 --> 00:17:59,320
How is it possible
that you don't like me?

322
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:05,030
What is it?
Are you playing hard to get?

323
00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:07,860
No, Do Ra.

324
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,100
I really don't want
to go out with you.

325
00:18:10,729 --> 00:18:12,770
I'll pretend you didn't say that.

326
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:16,370
I hope things won't be awkward
when we meet at work.

327
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,669
We can get along as coworkers.

328
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,610
Bye.

329
00:18:24,949 --> 00:18:25,979
That's ridiculous.

330
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,590
What is going on?

331
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,889
I see.

332
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,189
He's just surprised.

333
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:42,060
It was so sudden
that he was flustered.

334
00:18:42,699 --> 00:18:44,870
That's understandable.
Who can stay in his right mind...

335
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,540
when Park Do Ra asks him out?

336
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,739
Of course, he's shocked.

337
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:52,209
Once he calms down
and pulls himself together,

338
00:18:52,739 --> 00:18:55,639
I'm sure he will give me a call.

339
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,860
Do Ra was reckless like that
even when she was little.

340
00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:13,399
What's wrong with her?
It's so upsetting.

341
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:16,429
Gosh, I don't care.

342
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,499
Is this Ms. Kim Sun Young's place?

343
00:19:18,499 --> 00:19:20,169
This is from Ms. Jang Soo Yeon.

344
00:19:20,169 --> 00:19:22,070
Okay. Thank you.

345
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,770
Have a nice day, then.

346
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,580
My gosh.

347
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,209
What's going on?
Hey, what's all that?

348
00:19:30,209 --> 00:19:31,709
What is it?

349
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,719
Is this
from that rich friend of yours?

350
00:19:35,719 --> 00:19:38,520
Yes. She sent me all this again.

351
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,820
I feel so bad.

352
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,760
Just hurry and bring them here.
What's all that?

353
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,590
- Gosh, this is fruit.
- Fruit.

354
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:46,030
It looks so fresh and delicious.

355
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,600
Hey, what's that?
It's dried croaker aged in barley.

356
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,929
- And is this Korean beef?
- Yes.

357
00:19:50,929 --> 00:19:52,399
- My goodness.
- And that's...

358
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:55,300
It's hairtail from Jeju.
It must be expensive.

359
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,310
I wonder what this is.

360
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,909
I have no idea.

361
00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:01,040
Let me see.

362
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,050
- My goodness.
- Gosh, it's rice cake.

363
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,919
The rice cake looks so beautiful.

364
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,080
Look at the colors.

365
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,550
It looks really tasty.

366
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:13,760
Let me try one.

367
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,959
The rice cake looks so...

368
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:16,229
- My gosh.
- It looks delicious.

369
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,570
Hey, the rice cake is so chewy.

370
00:20:22,699 --> 00:20:24,969
And it's really sweet.
It's absolutely delicious.

371
00:20:24,969 --> 00:20:27,999
- Myung Dong, try one yourself.
- Sure.

372
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:30,540
Try this one instead.

373
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,239
- Mother, my gosh.
- Gosh.

374
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:35,850
- It's so good.
- It's delicious!

375
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,010
- Isn't it good?
- It is.

376
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,880
- Sun Young, try one.
- It's good.

377
00:20:39,249 --> 00:20:41,080
- Gosh.
- I can't believe it.

378
00:20:41,249 --> 00:20:42,820
- They're pretty as well.
- My gosh.

379
00:20:43,149 --> 00:20:44,189
How pretty are they?

380
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,729
- How can a rice cake be this good?
- Yummy.

381
00:20:49,889 --> 00:20:51,030
- How yummy.
- I'm home.

382
00:20:51,989 --> 00:20:53,959
Pil Seung, how...

383
00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:56,999
- Pil Seung, hey.
- What brings you home so early?

384
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,899
I should get days like this as well.

385
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,540
Anyway, what is all this?

386
00:21:00,699 --> 00:21:02,639
Pil Seung, look.

387
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,439
Your mom's friend.

388
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:08,040
That chairman's wife
sent these our way again.

389
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:11,310
And like always,
she didn't forget to include...

390
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,749
Jeju hairtail
which is your favorite.

391
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,179
- Did Ms. Jang send all of these?
- Yes.

392
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,850
Pil Seung, try one.

393
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:19,459
You won't believe
how soft and delicious it is.

394
00:21:19,459 --> 00:21:23,790
You must've been blessed in life
to have a friend like her.

395
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:27,260
She sends you meat
when we're almost out of it.

396
00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:29,669
The same goes for fish.

397
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:33,199
My gosh. No one has a friend
quite like her.

398
00:21:33,199 --> 00:21:34,840
Tell me about it.

399
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:38,310
Although I'm grateful,
I kind of feel guilty now.

400
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:42,310
Gosh. How can I ever repay her?

401
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,520
That reminds me. Her husband
treated me to coffee yesterday.

402
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:50,149
What? Chairman Gong
treated you to coffee?

403
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,350
Really?

404
00:21:51,949 --> 00:21:53,290
How did that happen?

405
00:21:54,219 --> 00:21:56,429
Our team was filming
outside APP Group's building,

406
00:21:56,429 --> 00:21:57,630
and I ran into him.

407
00:21:58,189 --> 00:22:01,560
Did he first ask you
to have coffee with him?

408
00:22:01,899 --> 00:22:05,600
Yes. At first, I was nervous
to have coffee...

409
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,139
with someone of his social status,

410
00:22:07,499 --> 00:22:09,139
but he made it comfortable for me.

411
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:12,510
So? What did you
talk about over coffee?

412
00:22:13,209 --> 00:22:16,209
Things like what I ate
that made me so tall,

413
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,479
the project I'm working on,

414
00:22:17,479 --> 00:22:19,050
what kind of show
I want to be filming,

415
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:20,520
- and so on and so forth.
- Gosh.

416
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,419
No way. You've come a long way...

417
00:22:23,419 --> 00:22:26,820
to have actually had coffee
with the chairman of APP Group.

418
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:30,189
Not just anyone gets to have coffee
with someone like him.

419
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,429
Tell me about it.

420
00:22:31,689 --> 00:22:34,729
Pil Seung, that is something
you can proudly speak of.

421
00:22:38,199 --> 00:22:39,669
If I had known
how big of a deal this was,

422
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:41,139
I would've taken photos...

423
00:22:41,139 --> 00:22:43,040
of us having coffee together.
It totally slipped my mind.

424
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,340
What a bummer.

425
00:22:44,469 --> 00:22:45,840
- Gosh.
- My gosh.

426
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,179
Hey, Sun Young.

427
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,449
What? You're outside our house?

428
00:23:07,097 --> 00:23:09,437
This is so good.

429
00:23:09,437 --> 00:23:11,038
I expected nothing less.

430
00:23:11,177 --> 00:23:14,048
I'm happy to know that you like it.

431
00:23:15,877 --> 00:23:18,677
You shouldn't have brought
something so heavy.

432
00:23:18,677 --> 00:23:19,748
I feel guilty
that you made the trip.

433
00:23:19,978 --> 00:23:21,647
Don't be ridiculous.

434
00:23:21,647 --> 00:23:24,357
I'm the one
who should be feeling guilty.

435
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:30,998
Soo Yeon, stop sending meat
and other things our way.

436
00:23:31,798 --> 00:23:34,328
I feel guilty to always be
on the receiving end...

437
00:23:34,328 --> 00:23:35,397
especially since
all I can do in return...

438
00:23:35,397 --> 00:23:36,468
is make kimchi for you.

439
00:23:37,697 --> 00:23:39,038
That's nonsense.

440
00:23:40,268 --> 00:23:41,968
Ma Ri and her father...

441
00:23:42,268 --> 00:23:45,107
love the kimchi you make.

442
00:23:45,207 --> 00:23:48,207
I start sweating
when I see we're almost out of it.

443
00:23:48,548 --> 00:23:49,978
- Do you mean that?
- Yes.

444
00:23:50,207 --> 00:23:52,847
You should've told me that
whenever you ran out.

445
00:23:52,847 --> 00:23:54,687
I'd gladly make
more batches for you.

446
00:23:54,947 --> 00:23:56,347
I didn't want to put you out.

447
00:23:56,347 --> 00:23:58,218
Making kimchi
isn't a stroll in the park.

448
00:23:58,617 --> 00:24:02,288
It's fine,
so don't hesitate to tell me.

449
00:24:02,857 --> 00:24:05,558
This is nothing compared
to the generosity you show me.

450
00:24:05,558 --> 00:24:07,397
This doesn't
inconvenience me at all.

451
00:24:07,728 --> 00:24:11,338
I'm dying to always do something
for you. Remember that.

452
00:24:11,838 --> 00:24:13,907
Really? Got it.

453
00:24:14,838 --> 00:24:16,068
- Thanks.
- My gosh.

454
00:24:17,377 --> 00:24:18,677
- By the way...
- Yes?

455
00:24:19,177 --> 00:24:20,707
Ae Kyo must not be home.

456
00:24:21,748 --> 00:24:23,508
Who knows? She must've gone out.

457
00:24:23,707 --> 00:24:25,578
- I see.
- Honey, I'm home.

458
00:24:25,578 --> 00:24:27,117
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

459
00:24:27,218 --> 00:24:29,018
Hello, Ms. Kim.

460
00:24:29,018 --> 00:24:30,588
Hello.

461
00:24:30,617 --> 00:24:32,258
You're home early today.

462
00:24:32,518 --> 00:24:34,657
Honey, Sun Young brought
the water kimchi...

463
00:24:34,657 --> 00:24:36,728
and young radish kimchi she made
which are your favorite.

464
00:24:37,157 --> 00:24:38,228
Is that so?

465
00:24:38,528 --> 00:24:40,968
My mouth is watering
just to hear about them.

466
00:24:40,968 --> 00:24:41,968
I appreciate this.

467
00:24:41,968 --> 00:24:45,338
We've always been enjoying
the kimchi you make for us.

468
00:24:45,338 --> 00:24:49,008
Gosh, I'm the one who appreciates
you enjoying something...

469
00:24:49,008 --> 00:24:50,937
that isn't worth the praise.

470
00:24:51,377 --> 00:24:56,107
By the way, I heard
you treated Pil Seung to coffee.

471
00:24:56,907 --> 00:25:00,478
I also appreciate
you saying nice things to him.

472
00:25:00,947 --> 00:25:04,718
Right. He grew up
to be a fine young man.

473
00:25:05,318 --> 00:25:09,788
He's now a fine young man
who also has a girlfriend.

474
00:25:10,488 --> 00:25:12,528
It was pleasing to hear that.

475
00:25:12,927 --> 00:25:13,927
Sorry?

476
00:25:14,528 --> 00:25:18,137
But Pil Seung
doesn't have a girlfriend.

477
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:20,707
Did he tell you otherwise?

478
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:25,338
No, it's not like that.
Soo Yeon told me...

479
00:25:25,738 --> 00:25:27,947
that Pil Seung was seeing someone.

480
00:25:29,078 --> 00:25:32,548
Soo Yeon, did you happen
to run into his girlfriend?

481
00:25:33,018 --> 00:25:36,048
What? Well, that's...

482
00:25:36,617 --> 00:25:37,917
- I'll tell you later.
- What?

483
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:40,518
Honey, you should wash up.

484
00:25:40,518 --> 00:25:42,157
Sun Young should leave
to cook dinner for her family.

485
00:25:42,728 --> 00:25:45,758
Sure. Tell Mr. Kang
to safely drive her home.

486
00:25:45,758 --> 00:25:47,897
- Right.
- Gosh, that isn't necessary.

487
00:25:47,897 --> 00:25:51,167
I'd rather you let him drive you.
Please visit when you can.

488
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:53,968
Sure thing.
Have a good evening, then.

489
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:55,867
- I'll see her off.
- Sure.

490
00:26:01,707 --> 00:26:02,778
Goodness.

491
00:26:03,847 --> 00:26:05,018
Soo Yeon.

492
00:26:06,018 --> 00:26:09,288
What do you mean
Pil Seung has a girlfriend?

493
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,617
Did you catch him with a girl?

494
00:26:13,088 --> 00:26:15,328
No, it's not like that.

495
00:26:15,728 --> 00:26:16,857
My husband kept saying...

496
00:26:16,857 --> 00:26:18,328
how Pil Seung grew up
to be a fine young man.

497
00:26:19,298 --> 00:26:21,568
He commented about
him being popular among women.

498
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:24,238
I said he might have a girlfriend,
and he must've misunderstood me.

499
00:26:25,538 --> 00:26:27,167
I see.

500
00:26:27,167 --> 00:26:29,437
- You should get in.
- Right.

501
00:26:33,107 --> 00:26:34,177
Mr. Kang.

502
00:26:35,078 --> 00:26:36,347
Please drive her home safely.

503
00:26:37,248 --> 00:26:38,347
I'll get going.

504
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,018
- Sure. Take care. And thanks.
- Bye.

505
00:26:41,788 --> 00:26:42,847
Bye.

506
00:27:00,068 --> 00:27:03,308
What's up with Soo Yeon today?

507
00:27:05,107 --> 00:27:06,808
Why did she say
Pil Seung's seeing someone...

508
00:27:06,808 --> 00:27:08,478
when he isn't?

509
00:27:22,357 --> 00:27:24,927
I like you.

510
00:27:25,228 --> 00:27:27,097
I have feelings for you!

511
00:27:30,127 --> 00:27:31,667
Is she kidding me?

512
00:27:32,597 --> 00:27:33,838
We're dating starting today?

513
00:27:34,867 --> 00:27:37,207
Should I date her
if she says she wants to date me?

514
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,377
Did she have
to confess her feelings...

515
00:27:41,377 --> 00:27:43,107
and disrupt my peaceful life?

516
00:27:44,518 --> 00:27:45,917
We'll be filming scenes tomorrow.

517
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:49,548
She confessed her feelings
out of nowhere,

518
00:27:50,818 --> 00:27:53,058
and now I'm bothered by this
to say the least.

519
00:27:54,988 --> 00:27:56,058
Darn.

520
00:27:56,927 --> 00:27:58,728
How am I going
to look her in the eyes again?

521
00:28:00,157 --> 00:28:01,998
- Ji Sung, can you hand these out?
- Sure.

522
00:28:04,468 --> 00:28:05,498
Sung Ha.

523
00:28:17,778 --> 00:28:20,248
("Straightforward Romance")

524
00:28:33,897 --> 00:28:34,897
Dae Chung.

525
00:28:36,627 --> 00:28:37,697
Pil Seung.

526
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:40,838
Ms. Park, what are you doing?

527
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:42,607
You said you wouldn't
be like this on set.

528
00:28:46,107 --> 00:28:47,548
Is your phone not working?

529
00:28:47,907 --> 00:28:49,877
No, it's perfectly fine.

530
00:28:50,008 --> 00:28:51,147
Then why didn't you call me?

531
00:28:51,677 --> 00:28:53,778
Do you really not
have feelings for me?

532
00:28:54,947 --> 00:28:56,917
Come on. I doubt it.

533
00:29:11,097 --> 00:29:13,397
What's the matter with you?
This is our workplace.

534
00:29:15,008 --> 00:29:16,038
Pil Seung.

535
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:19,877
I understand how flustered
you must've been yesterday.

536
00:29:20,137 --> 00:29:22,278
An actress of my level
confessed her feelings for you,

537
00:29:22,278 --> 00:29:23,808
so it would've seemed
too good to be true.

538
00:29:24,048 --> 00:29:26,117
I bet you thought
you were daydreaming.

539
00:29:27,347 --> 00:29:30,647
But my feelings for you are genuine.

540
00:29:31,157 --> 00:29:32,318
You aren't daydreaming.

541
00:29:37,228 --> 00:29:40,058
I don't believe
that you don't have feelings for me.

542
00:29:40,058 --> 00:29:42,097
How can one not like me?

543
00:29:42,097 --> 00:29:43,728
It isn't possible.

544
00:29:45,697 --> 00:29:47,298
Is it because...

545
00:29:47,298 --> 00:29:50,407
I'm an A-list actor
and you're an assistant director?

546
00:29:50,768 --> 00:29:52,937
Don't let that bother you at all.

547
00:29:52,937 --> 00:29:54,347
I'm perfectly fine with it.

548
00:29:54,808 --> 00:29:58,278
Pil Seung, let's go out.

549
00:29:58,548 --> 00:30:00,048
I know you have feelings for me too.

550
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:03,088
Do Ra, this is not what I want.

551
00:30:07,288 --> 00:30:08,328
Do you really...

552
00:30:09,988 --> 00:30:12,597
not have any feelings for me?

553
00:30:12,597 --> 00:30:14,528
- No.
- How is that possible?

554
00:30:15,367 --> 00:30:16,627
Fine.

555
00:30:16,968 --> 00:30:19,167
Then, make me understand...

556
00:30:19,167 --> 00:30:21,707
by stating three things
you dislike about me.

557
00:30:21,937 --> 00:30:24,538
I'll reconsider
if what you say is plausible.

558
00:30:25,478 --> 00:30:27,877
See? You can't come up
with anything.

559
00:30:27,877 --> 00:30:29,177
You're rejecting me on purpose.

560
00:30:30,677 --> 00:30:31,677
One.

561
00:30:32,177 --> 00:30:34,078
I don't like women
who are this stubborn.

562
00:30:34,078 --> 00:30:35,088
Two.

563
00:30:35,088 --> 00:30:36,818
You wrote "complete moron"
on my back.

564
00:30:36,818 --> 00:30:38,687
I don't like women
who look down on others.

565
00:30:38,687 --> 00:30:39,988
And three.

566
00:30:40,218 --> 00:30:42,328
You're not my type.
Are you satisfied?

567
00:30:46,828 --> 00:30:48,468
How does that make any sense?

568
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:50,667
That doesn't make any sense.

569
00:30:52,338 --> 00:30:55,038
Ms. Park, what's wrong?
What is it this time around?

570
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:56,637
Did Pil Seung bother you again?

571
00:30:56,738 --> 00:30:59,078
Gosh, no. It's nothing.

572
00:30:59,078 --> 00:31:01,748
Jin Gu, I didn't do anything wrong.

573
00:31:03,078 --> 00:31:05,318
Did Pil Seung
talk smack about you again?

574
00:31:05,778 --> 00:31:06,818
No.

575
00:31:07,748 --> 00:31:10,818
It's just that we couldn't
see eye to eye on something.

576
00:31:12,117 --> 00:31:13,387
So Director Hong,

577
00:31:13,387 --> 00:31:15,588
don't tell him off like that again.

578
00:31:17,957 --> 00:31:20,998
What's going on when we're close
to wrapping up this project?

579
00:31:21,498 --> 00:31:24,068
How can that be his reason
for not liking me?

580
00:31:24,298 --> 00:31:25,738
I'm not his type?

581
00:31:26,437 --> 00:31:28,808
As if that makes any sense.

582
00:31:33,377 --> 00:31:36,947
Seriously.
I know he has feelings for me too,

583
00:31:38,177 --> 00:31:40,347
so why is he acting like he doesn't?

584
00:31:54,028 --> 00:31:55,228
I had fun at the coin karaoke,

585
00:31:55,228 --> 00:31:56,597
and taking our four-cut photos
was a blast.

586
00:31:56,597 --> 00:31:58,038
It was a fun day today.

587
00:31:58,038 --> 00:31:59,897
Why don't we get together
next weekend as well?

588
00:32:00,137 --> 00:32:02,738
Sounds good. Next weekend,

589
00:32:03,207 --> 00:32:04,268
we'll go to an amusement park.

590
00:32:04,268 --> 00:32:06,078
An amusement park? Sure thing!

591
00:32:06,078 --> 00:32:07,778
- Bye, Ma Ri.
- Bye, Ma Ri.

592
00:32:07,778 --> 00:32:10,947
Bye, guys. See you next weekend.

593
00:32:13,518 --> 00:32:15,318
Ru Ru, let's go.

594
00:32:21,387 --> 00:32:23,488
No way. Toy claw machines!

595
00:32:28,597 --> 00:32:32,238
Ru Ru, I got myself
a lot of change today.

596
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:35,207
I'll make sure
to take home your friend.

597
00:32:55,957 --> 00:32:56,988
Again.

598
00:32:57,758 --> 00:32:59,058
Nice.

599
00:33:00,157 --> 00:33:01,167
Gosh.

600
00:33:02,197 --> 00:33:05,097
That's the one
I've always wanted to have.

601
00:33:05,738 --> 00:33:07,367
Do you want this?

602
00:33:07,738 --> 00:33:09,907
Yes, it's adorable.

603
00:33:14,907 --> 00:33:17,508
There are a lot of prettier toys
at that store across the street.

604
00:33:18,117 --> 00:33:20,548
How about you come with me
and let me get them for you?

605
00:33:20,847 --> 00:33:22,818
Really? Yes, I'd like that.

606
00:33:25,157 --> 00:33:26,157
Come on.

607
00:33:29,427 --> 00:33:31,157
Are we still not there?

608
00:33:32,828 --> 00:33:34,968
I doubt there's a shop
in an alleyway like this.

609
00:33:37,397 --> 00:33:38,397
Excuse me.

610
00:33:40,437 --> 00:33:42,468
I'd rather get going.

611
00:33:44,038 --> 00:33:46,338
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

612
00:33:46,338 --> 00:33:48,248
There are other
pretty toys over there.

613
00:33:48,248 --> 00:33:50,008
I'd rather go.

614
00:33:50,478 --> 00:33:51,578
Get over here!

615
00:33:51,578 --> 00:33:53,677
Mom! No!

616
00:33:53,677 --> 00:33:55,647
Ru Ru, no.

617
00:34:02,387 --> 00:34:04,728
Come with me, darn it.

618
00:34:04,728 --> 00:34:06,597
- Wait. What am I hearing?
- Help!

619
00:34:06,597 --> 00:34:08,627
- We're almost there.
- Zip it, will you?

620
00:34:08,627 --> 00:34:11,298
- Come on, and shut it.
- Get away from me!

621
00:34:11,298 --> 00:34:13,468
- Hey, do you have a death wish?
- Don't!

622
00:34:19,477 --> 00:34:21,807
- Ma Ri!
- Ma Ri.

623
00:34:21,807 --> 00:34:22,807
- Ma Ri.
- Dad.

624
00:34:22,807 --> 00:34:24,077
- Ma Ri...
- Mom, Dad.

625
00:34:24,077 --> 00:34:25,318
We're here.

626
00:34:25,477 --> 00:34:28,488
Goodness. You're all right.

627
00:34:29,588 --> 00:34:31,417
Daddy's here, and you're fine.

628
00:34:32,088 --> 00:34:33,758
Ma Ri, what happened?

629
00:34:34,088 --> 00:34:36,127
Please tell me you're all right.

630
00:34:36,388 --> 00:34:37,388
I am.

631
00:34:37,758 --> 00:34:40,327
That jerk dragged me away,

632
00:34:40,327 --> 00:34:42,598
but he helped me escape.

633
00:34:44,738 --> 00:34:46,167
That's not true.

634
00:34:46,368 --> 00:34:48,868
She willingly came with me
when I asked her to.

635
00:34:48,868 --> 00:34:50,968
I didn't take her anywhere
against her will.

636
00:34:51,537 --> 00:34:52,537
But then,

637
00:34:53,477 --> 00:34:55,307
she suddenly hit me with a brick,

638
00:34:55,448 --> 00:34:57,747
and this punk
threw punches out of nowhere.

639
00:34:57,747 --> 00:34:59,517
This is so unfair.

640
00:34:59,778 --> 00:35:02,388
You hurt me first.

641
00:35:02,618 --> 00:35:04,618
You promised
to give me pretty toys...

642
00:35:04,618 --> 00:35:07,517
but then dragged me
into some dark alleyway.

643
00:35:07,787 --> 00:35:09,827
You touched me
when I didn't want you to.

644
00:35:10,057 --> 00:35:12,827
Look at what happened to my clothes!

645
00:35:12,827 --> 00:35:15,468
You punk.
How dare you touch my daughter?

646
00:35:15,468 --> 00:35:17,127
- You punk. Get over here.
- Sir, please.

647
00:35:17,127 --> 00:35:18,568
- Please calm down.
- You're done for.

648
00:35:18,568 --> 00:35:20,897
- Sir, please.
- Help!

649
00:35:20,897 --> 00:35:22,037
Get over here!

650
00:35:23,508 --> 00:35:24,838
Bear with me a little longer.

651
00:35:25,477 --> 00:35:28,647
Ma Ri, how many times
did I tell you...

652
00:35:28,647 --> 00:35:31,008
not to follow a stranger?

653
00:35:31,008 --> 00:35:33,747
Man or woman, it doesn't matter.

654
00:35:34,377 --> 00:35:37,747
I'm sorry, Dad.
I remember what you taught me,

655
00:35:37,747 --> 00:35:40,557
but I liked the doll that guy had.

656
00:35:41,088 --> 00:35:43,888
It slipped my mind since I thought
it could be Ru Ru's sister.

657
00:35:44,727 --> 00:35:48,468
Besides, he seemed nice at first.

658
00:35:48,598 --> 00:35:50,167
He didn't seem evil, so...

659
00:35:50,167 --> 00:35:51,667
We taught you not to fall for it.

660
00:35:51,667 --> 00:35:53,167
You shouldn't have followed him out.

661
00:35:54,667 --> 00:35:56,037
Something similar
happened in the past...

662
00:35:56,037 --> 00:35:57,338
which caused you big trouble.

663
00:35:57,338 --> 00:35:59,477
He was a bad man, remember?

664
00:35:59,477 --> 00:36:01,107
How could you have
been foolish enough...

665
00:36:01,107 --> 00:36:02,778
to trust a stranger again?

666
00:36:02,977 --> 00:36:04,147
Honey, please.

667
00:36:04,147 --> 00:36:06,377
You promised us, remember?

668
00:36:06,377 --> 00:36:08,088
But then you forgot and...

669
00:36:09,517 --> 00:36:12,557
You're not a child.
You're not an idiot!

670
00:36:14,417 --> 00:36:17,357
Mom, I'm sorry.

671
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:19,928
I'm really sorry. I...

672
00:36:21,127 --> 00:36:24,327
I'm sorry for being a retard.

673
00:36:31,437 --> 00:36:33,537
No, Ma Ri. Don't apologize.

674
00:36:35,348 --> 00:36:37,178
That came out wrong.

675
00:36:37,877 --> 00:36:41,147
Ma Ri, I'm the one who's sorry.

676
00:36:42,088 --> 00:36:44,147
This isn't your fault at all.

677
00:36:45,758 --> 00:36:49,158
I'm to blame. It's my fault.

678
00:36:49,627 --> 00:36:51,528
Ma Ri...

679
00:36:52,497 --> 00:36:56,198
Ma Ri, you're not an idiot.
You aren't.

680
00:36:56,428 --> 00:37:00,068
You overcame a serious trauma,

681
00:37:00,068 --> 00:37:02,707
and withstood
all those risky surgeries.

682
00:37:02,707 --> 00:37:05,278
Our Ma Ri is one strong woman.

683
00:37:05,937 --> 00:37:09,107
And you are the apple of my eye.

684
00:37:11,577 --> 00:37:14,917
That will be the last time
I go with a stranger.

685
00:37:14,917 --> 00:37:16,118
I promise.

686
00:37:17,088 --> 00:37:20,318
So Dad, please don't cry.

687
00:37:21,017 --> 00:37:22,758
Mom, don't you cry either.

688
00:37:22,758 --> 00:37:25,658
I'm so sorry.

689
00:37:26,557 --> 00:37:28,098
Please don't cry.

690
00:37:28,368 --> 00:37:30,868
Ma Ri, it's all right.

691
00:37:32,738 --> 00:37:35,437
Don't follow strangers
and always be careful.

692
00:37:35,437 --> 00:37:37,207
You're all right.

693
00:37:38,207 --> 00:37:39,537
Why are you crying?

694
00:37:41,207 --> 00:37:42,747
Please don't cry.

695
00:37:44,607 --> 00:37:45,618
Auntie.

696
00:37:47,948 --> 00:37:50,517
Things could've been worse today.

697
00:37:50,517 --> 00:37:52,818
When something catches
Ma Ri's attention like that,

698
00:37:52,818 --> 00:37:54,417
she can't think straight.

699
00:37:54,888 --> 00:37:57,627
She follows strangers
just to get a pretty doll.

700
00:37:58,057 --> 00:37:59,227
And at that age,

701
00:37:59,227 --> 00:38:01,258
she plays with neighborhood girls
who are in elementary school.

702
00:38:01,968 --> 00:38:02,997
What?

703
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:07,138
She plays with neighborhood girls
who are in elementary school?

704
00:38:07,267 --> 00:38:08,437
That's right.

705
00:38:08,437 --> 00:38:11,207
Girls her age
don't want to hang out with her.

706
00:38:11,607 --> 00:38:13,807
But that's only because
she treats them to ice cream,

707
00:38:13,807 --> 00:38:15,977
candies, and coin karaoke.

708
00:38:17,008 --> 00:38:18,077
Little girls hang out with her...

709
00:38:18,077 --> 00:38:20,218
because Ma Ri pays for everything
like a loser.

710
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:23,848
Goodness. How upsetting is this?

711
00:38:24,917 --> 00:38:27,888
But they want Ma Ri
to take over the company one day...

712
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:30,857
and have her marry
to give them a son-in-law.

713
00:38:32,298 --> 00:38:34,428
But why would
anyone decent enough...

714
00:38:34,428 --> 00:38:36,767
marry a girl
who can't tell right from wrong?

715
00:38:37,167 --> 00:38:39,537
Only scumbags
would try to win her over.

716
00:38:42,107 --> 00:38:44,008
Every time this happens,

717
00:38:44,008 --> 00:38:46,738
this gravely upsets me...

718
00:38:46,738 --> 00:38:48,577
being her grandmother and all.

719
00:38:50,307 --> 00:38:53,178
What can I do
about my poor Jin Taek?

720
00:38:53,747 --> 00:38:55,318
My poor nephew.

721
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,357
The only child he has
is in that state,

722
00:38:58,988 --> 00:39:00,457
and he has no idea
that he is being played...

723
00:39:00,457 --> 00:39:01,957
by a vixen wearing a human face.

724
00:39:02,357 --> 00:39:03,357
Goodness.

725
00:39:03,357 --> 00:39:05,758
Auntie, what do you mean by that?

726
00:39:06,227 --> 00:39:08,767
A vixen wearing a human face?
Who are you referring to?

727
00:39:09,167 --> 00:39:11,667
Are you talking about Soo Yeon?

728
00:39:12,437 --> 00:39:14,497
As if I said anything.

729
00:39:15,238 --> 00:39:17,638
Would it kill you
to keep your mouth shut?

730
00:39:17,667 --> 00:39:19,937
You never know when to talk or not.

731
00:39:19,937 --> 00:39:22,147
What? Me?

732
00:39:23,048 --> 00:39:26,417
Look at what has happened
to this family.

733
00:39:27,548 --> 00:39:29,417
What did I say
that got her so upset?

734
00:39:29,687 --> 00:39:31,247
She brought it up.

735
00:39:33,088 --> 00:39:35,488
A vixen wearing a human face?

736
00:39:36,258 --> 00:39:37,428
What does that mean?

737
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:44,022
Hi, Madam Cho. It's me.

738
00:39:44,761 --> 00:39:47,232
I was waiting to hear from you.

739
00:39:47,861 --> 00:39:50,201
The weather changed,

740
00:39:50,567 --> 00:39:53,538
so I'll take
the last flight out to Seoul.

741
00:39:54,168 --> 00:39:55,938
When should we meet tomorrow?

742
00:39:56,107 --> 00:39:57,137
Really?

743
00:39:57,578 --> 00:40:01,748
Are you free to meet
at 11 a.m. tomorrow?

744
00:40:02,947 --> 00:40:06,248
Then I'll see you
at the cafe in Seoul Hotel.

745
00:40:07,748 --> 00:40:10,058
Okay, Madam Cho. Thanks.

746
00:40:11,188 --> 00:40:12,628
Have a safe trip.

747
00:40:15,927 --> 00:40:16,998
Yes.

748
00:40:17,657 --> 00:40:19,427
The timing worked out.

749
00:40:20,427 --> 00:40:21,868
Ma Ri's a mess.

750
00:40:22,637 --> 00:40:25,067
Once Jin Taek hears...

751
00:40:25,067 --> 00:40:27,607
what Madam Cho has to say,

752
00:40:28,168 --> 00:40:30,777
he'll believe and listen to me.

753
00:40:31,507 --> 00:40:33,208
Yes. All will be well tomorrow.

754
00:40:36,378 --> 00:40:39,078
Who's this?
Is this really my son Do Jun?

755
00:40:39,078 --> 00:40:42,217
What are you doing here
when you should be in the US?

756
00:40:42,317 --> 00:40:43,918
It's spring break.

757
00:40:43,918 --> 00:40:46,558
What? Oh, right. Spring break.

758
00:40:46,558 --> 00:40:48,257
Silly me. I forgot.

759
00:40:49,188 --> 00:40:50,398
Do Jun.

760
00:40:50,558 --> 00:40:53,228
If you'd called, I'd have
picked you up at the airport.

761
00:40:53,228 --> 00:40:54,297
Come here.

762
00:40:54,567 --> 00:40:56,137
I haven't seen you in so long.

763
00:40:56,337 --> 00:40:58,637
- Let's have a look.
- At what?

764
00:40:58,637 --> 00:41:01,538
- What happened to your face?
- Oh, that.

765
00:41:01,538 --> 00:41:02,637
Who did this?

766
00:41:02,938 --> 00:41:05,378
It's nothing, Mom.
I helped someone on the way.

767
00:41:05,607 --> 00:41:08,047
Who did you help? Why get involved
in other people's business?

768
00:41:08,047 --> 00:41:10,118
There are so many weirdos out there.

769
00:41:10,118 --> 00:41:12,848
What if it leaves a mark
on your handsome face?

770
00:41:12,848 --> 00:41:14,648
- It's fine.
- Goodness.

771
00:41:14,648 --> 00:41:16,217
- It looks bad.
- It's not.

772
00:41:16,217 --> 00:41:17,387
- It is.
- Hey.

773
00:41:17,387 --> 00:41:19,217
- Do Jun!
- Do Ra.

774
00:41:22,058 --> 00:41:23,958
What happened to you?

775
00:41:23,958 --> 00:41:26,498
You said you'd be
too busy with studies to come.

776
00:41:26,498 --> 00:41:28,668
I said that to surprise you.

777
00:41:29,268 --> 00:41:31,098
My baby brother.

778
00:41:31,098 --> 00:41:34,507
- I missed you so much.
- My gosh.

779
00:41:34,507 --> 00:41:37,438
People would think you're his mom.

780
00:41:37,507 --> 00:41:40,208
Mom, did you forget
I practically raised him?

781
00:41:40,808 --> 00:41:44,047
- My baby brother.
- Goodness.

782
00:41:44,648 --> 00:41:46,317
Welcome home.

783
00:41:46,317 --> 00:41:49,148
Me too now. Can I join in?

784
00:41:49,148 --> 00:41:50,387
Go away.

785
00:41:50,387 --> 00:41:52,058
- I'm a brother too.
- No.

786
00:41:53,587 --> 00:41:55,628
- I want to join in too.
- Okay.

787
00:41:55,628 --> 00:41:57,297
Do Jun.

788
00:41:57,297 --> 00:41:59,797
- Do Jun.
- Long time no see.

789
00:42:15,148 --> 00:42:17,817
Honey. Mr. Kang's here.

790
00:42:22,788 --> 00:42:23,817
Mr. Kang.

791
00:42:24,618 --> 00:42:27,027
From now on, when Ma Ri goes out,

792
00:42:27,828 --> 00:42:29,498
will you take good care of her?

793
00:42:31,657 --> 00:42:32,828
You can't let her...

794
00:42:34,067 --> 00:42:37,098
out of your sight for a second.

795
00:42:37,467 --> 00:42:39,137
Yes, sir. I understand.

796
00:42:39,507 --> 00:42:41,967
Please do that. You can go now.

797
00:42:50,918 --> 00:42:51,918
Darling.

798
00:42:54,547 --> 00:42:55,788
What happened today...

799
00:42:56,717 --> 00:42:58,717
will never happen again.

800
00:42:59,357 --> 00:43:01,257
We can protect Ma Ri.

801
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:22,078
Who are you going to meet
that you're making such a fuss?

802
00:43:22,878 --> 00:43:25,078
I have a meeting in a short while.

803
00:43:25,277 --> 00:43:28,018
It's someone you must meet,
Jin Taek.

804
00:43:28,717 --> 00:43:29,958
You'll know when you meet her.

805
00:43:30,487 --> 00:43:32,618
The meeting's
the least of your worries.

806
00:43:44,498 --> 00:43:46,868
We've been here for 30 minutes.
Why isn't she here yet?

807
00:43:47,237 --> 00:43:48,368
Is the traffic holding her up?

808
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:54,208
Did she miss the flight
from Jeju Island yesterday?

809
00:43:54,677 --> 00:43:57,578
Why won't she even answer her phone?

810
00:43:58,717 --> 00:44:00,987
Auntie.
Why don't you call her again?

811
00:44:01,348 --> 00:44:02,518
Okay.

812
00:44:06,058 --> 00:44:07,188
It's ringing now.

813
00:44:08,188 --> 00:44:09,228
Hello?

814
00:44:11,027 --> 00:44:14,728
Isn't this Madam Cho's phone?

815
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:18,837
Who are you?

816
00:44:20,808 --> 00:44:22,567
What?

817
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:25,177
What did you just say?

818
00:44:26,277 --> 00:44:27,348
Oh, dear.

819
00:44:28,478 --> 00:44:29,547
Goodness.

820
00:44:30,947 --> 00:44:34,648
Auntie. Tell me what this is about.

821
00:44:34,918 --> 00:44:35,987
Oh, dear.

822
00:44:35,987 --> 00:44:39,387
Who is this dead Madam Cho?

823
00:44:43,098 --> 00:44:46,297
Honey,
I brought some warm honey water.

824
00:44:47,098 --> 00:44:49,637
Auntie. Drink some honey tea.

825
00:44:51,197 --> 00:44:52,268
Get out.

826
00:44:53,137 --> 00:44:55,467
I want to be alone.

827
00:44:58,137 --> 00:44:59,308
What's wrong?

828
00:45:00,808 --> 00:45:02,978
She wanted me to meet someone today.

829
00:45:04,277 --> 00:45:05,848
I think it was someone important.

830
00:45:07,148 --> 00:45:09,487
But she died in a car accident.

831
00:45:10,657 --> 00:45:12,788
Oh, dear. Who was it?

832
00:45:13,987 --> 00:45:15,027
Get out.

833
00:45:15,387 --> 00:45:18,197
Leave. I said I wanted to be alone.

834
00:45:19,357 --> 00:45:21,427
I don't want to see either of you.

835
00:45:22,328 --> 00:45:23,398
Okay.

836
00:45:24,768 --> 00:45:26,668
Let's go, honey.

837
00:45:33,507 --> 00:45:34,607
Oh, my gosh.

838
00:45:39,848 --> 00:45:40,848
Goodness.

839
00:45:42,618 --> 00:45:44,317
With Madam Cho dead and gone,

840
00:45:45,357 --> 00:45:46,857
if I were to tell Jin Taek...

841
00:45:47,157 --> 00:45:48,927
without any proof,

842
00:45:49,757 --> 00:45:52,297
he'd think I'm a senile old woman.

843
00:45:54,328 --> 00:45:57,337
What am I to do about it now?

844
00:46:00,837 --> 00:46:01,907
Yes.

845
00:46:02,808 --> 00:46:04,677
I can find Jessica.

846
00:46:05,478 --> 00:46:07,047
Madam Cho's friend Jessica.

847
00:46:08,177 --> 00:46:11,677
The landlady who leased the annex
to that vixen's boyfriend.

848
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:13,848
That's it.

849
00:46:22,857 --> 00:46:23,857
Yes.

850
00:46:24,757 --> 00:46:25,828
It's me.

851
00:46:26,427 --> 00:46:28,998
I need to find someone.

852
00:46:29,868 --> 00:46:31,868
I need you to find a woman...

853
00:46:32,297 --> 00:46:35,737
called Jessica who lived in Boston
about 35 years ago.

854
00:46:37,407 --> 00:46:38,837
She'll be in her late 60s now.

855
00:46:46,848 --> 00:46:47,848
Excuse me.

856
00:47:01,868 --> 00:47:03,467
Can I have a cappuccino?

857
00:47:06,837 --> 00:47:08,438
One cappuccino.

858
00:47:08,438 --> 00:47:11,837
Do Sik.
Why on earth are you here today?

859
00:47:12,708 --> 00:47:14,878
She even slapped you
square in the face.

860
00:47:15,447 --> 00:47:16,478
No.

861
00:47:16,677 --> 00:47:19,688
You can't let a woman
remember Park Do Sik as trash.

862
00:47:20,148 --> 00:47:22,418
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.

863
00:47:24,558 --> 00:47:25,618
Excuse me.

864
00:47:30,328 --> 00:47:33,567
- Goodbye.
- Two iced vanilla lattes, please.

865
00:47:37,467 --> 00:47:38,797
What are you doing?

866
00:47:39,967 --> 00:47:41,137
I'm at work.

867
00:47:52,848 --> 00:47:53,887
Two.

868
00:47:56,288 --> 00:47:58,857
Here are two iced vanilla lattes.

869
00:47:59,157 --> 00:48:00,188
Excuse me.

870
00:48:01,157 --> 00:48:02,657
One is for you.

871
00:48:05,857 --> 00:48:08,067
Hey, you. Come outside.

872
00:48:19,947 --> 00:48:21,047
What is it?

873
00:48:23,378 --> 00:48:25,848
What are you trying to pull
at my workplace?

874
00:48:26,618 --> 00:48:27,918
Are you kidding me?

875
00:48:28,547 --> 00:48:29,788
I'm not kidding you.

876
00:48:31,157 --> 00:48:32,157
What I'm saying is...

877
00:48:32,918 --> 00:48:34,887
Can you please stop
holding grudges against me?

878
00:48:35,828 --> 00:48:38,128
I can't go on my way
with you holding grudges against me.

879
00:48:38,598 --> 00:48:41,368
How would I leave with a light heart
in front of your stern eyes?

880
00:48:43,168 --> 00:48:45,737
What should I do with this thing?

881
00:48:45,737 --> 00:48:48,438
Hey, do you want
to get slapped again?

882
00:48:48,438 --> 00:48:52,107
I think I hurt you deeply.

883
00:48:52,438 --> 00:48:54,547
So I want to make it up to you,

884
00:48:54,547 --> 00:48:55,978
but you won't receive the bag.

885
00:48:55,978 --> 00:48:57,478
What should I do
to make you feel better?

886
00:48:57,478 --> 00:48:58,677
What do you want me to do?

887
00:48:58,677 --> 00:49:01,788
I told you to stay out of my sight.

888
00:49:02,018 --> 00:49:04,987
I don't want to see
the trashy face of yours again.

889
00:49:11,458 --> 00:49:13,427
I don't want to do this either.

890
00:49:14,927 --> 00:49:17,268
But why can't I stop coming here?

891
00:49:17,268 --> 00:49:19,907
And why can't I stop
feeling bad for her?

892
00:49:24,507 --> 00:49:26,607
I guess this is why they say
wrongdoing makes my life miserable.

893
00:49:51,598 --> 00:49:52,637
Pil Seung.

894
00:49:53,668 --> 00:49:56,907
I've given it some serious thought.

895
00:49:57,677 --> 00:50:00,507
About why you keep
denying your feelings for me.

896
00:50:01,777 --> 00:50:04,447
I tried to put myself in your shoes.

897
00:50:04,518 --> 00:50:08,217
I understand dating me
isn't an easy decision to make.

898
00:50:09,188 --> 00:50:12,487
I'm an actress
loved by all the men in the country.

899
00:50:12,487 --> 00:50:14,927
And I'm a star
that everyone admires.

900
00:50:14,927 --> 00:50:16,797
Dating someone like me...

901
00:50:18,027 --> 00:50:21,398
can be too much to deal with
for an ordinary person like you.

902
00:50:23,567 --> 00:50:26,268
I understand how you feel.

903
00:50:29,208 --> 00:50:31,777
But, Pil Seung,
we've known each other...

904
00:50:31,777 --> 00:50:34,208
since we were little and innocent.

905
00:50:34,708 --> 00:50:36,248
Just forget that I'm a top star.

906
00:50:36,248 --> 00:50:39,348
Try to see me as an ordinary girl
who lives next door.

907
00:50:40,518 --> 00:50:42,118
You will feel comfortable that way.

908
00:50:45,357 --> 00:50:47,958
Do Ra, it's not like that.

909
00:50:48,657 --> 00:50:50,458
I don't want to go out with you.

910
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:52,328
I don't have feelings for you.

911
00:50:52,927 --> 00:50:54,268
How many times
do I have to tell you?

912
00:50:54,728 --> 00:50:57,038
Why are you getting your own way
without listening to me?

913
00:51:04,938 --> 00:51:06,050
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

914
00:51:12,148 --> 00:51:14,217
Hello, Mr. Gong.

915
00:51:17,918 --> 00:51:19,257
Tonight?

916
00:51:20,728 --> 00:51:23,657
Of course. I'm free tonight.

917
00:51:24,958 --> 00:51:26,898
At a French restaurant...

918
00:51:26,898 --> 00:51:28,868
in Cheongdam-dong at 7 p.m.?

919
00:51:30,737 --> 00:51:31,737
Yes.

920
00:51:33,668 --> 00:51:35,107
I'll see you then.

921
00:51:39,578 --> 00:51:40,578
Pil Seung.

922
00:51:43,348 --> 00:51:44,947
I'm asking you one last time.

923
00:51:46,817 --> 00:51:49,047
Mr. Gong wants to see me tonight.

924
00:51:49,047 --> 00:51:51,458
If you don't want me to go,
I won't see him.

925
00:51:51,518 --> 00:51:54,458
Do whatever you want.
Why are you asking me?

926
00:52:01,898 --> 00:52:05,098
Yes! They say
only the brave deserve the fair.

927
00:52:06,098 --> 00:52:07,938
It's a good thing that I called her.

928
00:52:11,677 --> 00:52:13,348
I guess Do Ra is feeling better now.

929
00:52:14,248 --> 00:52:15,407
What should we do tonight?

930
00:52:16,507 --> 00:52:18,277
What should I do to impress her?

931
00:52:20,348 --> 00:52:21,348
That's right.

932
00:52:21,348 --> 00:52:23,288
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

933
00:52:32,128 --> 00:52:34,967
I'll take this.
The one with the biggest bead.

934
00:52:36,837 --> 00:52:38,938
Yes. I'll take care of it
right away.

935
00:52:38,938 --> 00:52:40,168
Okay. Thank you.

936
00:52:45,677 --> 00:52:46,777
Curly-haired Assistant Director.

937
00:52:47,607 --> 00:52:49,878
I'm heading
to the French restaurant now.

938
00:52:51,348 --> 00:52:52,478
I'm leaving now.

939
00:52:55,788 --> 00:52:56,788
Pil Seung.

940
00:52:57,357 --> 00:52:59,757
This is your last chance to take me.

941
00:53:00,087 --> 00:53:02,427
If you don't stop me, I'll leave.

942
00:53:03,898 --> 00:53:05,098
Ms. Park Do Ra.

943
00:53:05,857 --> 00:53:07,297
What are you doing?

944
00:53:07,868 --> 00:53:10,598
Wherever you go,
it has nothing to do with me.

945
00:53:11,067 --> 00:53:12,438
Go if you want to go.

946
00:53:12,438 --> 00:53:14,038
And don't go if you don't want to.

947
00:53:14,038 --> 00:53:15,907
Just stop asking me what to do.

948
00:53:16,107 --> 00:53:17,337
Do whatever you want.

949
00:53:20,777 --> 00:53:21,947
Fine.

950
00:53:24,918 --> 00:53:26,378
I don't want you...

951
00:53:26,378 --> 00:53:28,348
to regret not holding me back.

952
00:53:39,498 --> 00:53:42,828
Most women would fall for a man
like CEO Gong Jin Dan.

953
00:53:43,098 --> 00:53:45,737
He has a reputation
as a womanizer though.

954
00:53:45,737 --> 00:53:47,768
He's known
to go after new actresses.

955
00:53:47,768 --> 00:53:48,967
Hey, Yoon Hee.

956
00:53:49,708 --> 00:53:51,137
You're at that hotel?

957
00:53:51,607 --> 00:53:54,407
Okay. I'll be right there.
Wait for me.

958
00:53:57,378 --> 00:53:59,317
Why does it have to be
CEO Gong Jin Dan?

959
00:53:59,978 --> 00:54:01,587
She shouldn't be dating a womanizer.

960
00:54:02,788 --> 00:54:04,157
Gosh, forget it.

961
00:54:04,757 --> 00:54:06,288
What does it have to do with me?

962
00:54:06,288 --> 00:54:07,458
Do Ra isn't a little kid.

963
00:54:08,087 --> 00:54:09,427
She's old enough to know
what she's doing.

964
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:12,958
By the way,

965
00:54:13,728 --> 00:54:15,967
does she know we're having
a shoot at 6 a.m. tomorrow?

966
00:54:17,098 --> 00:54:19,538
I don't think I told her.

967
00:54:26,708 --> 00:54:27,907
Ms. Park.

968
00:54:28,447 --> 00:54:30,547
You know we're having a shoot
at 6 a.m. tomorrow, right?

969
00:54:33,277 --> 00:54:35,748
(Ms. Park, you know we're having
a shoot at 6 a.m. tomorrow, right?)

970
00:54:38,157 --> 00:54:39,688
Did she not hear the text tone?

971
00:54:43,328 --> 00:54:44,398
Ms. Park.

972
00:54:45,098 --> 00:54:47,168
You know we're having a shoot
in Paju tomorrow, right?

973
00:54:50,098 --> 00:54:52,837
(Ms. Park, you know we're having
a shoot in Paju tomorrow, right?)

974
00:54:54,368 --> 00:54:56,538
What is she doing?
Why isn't she checking her phone?

975
00:54:56,538 --> 00:54:58,378
What's more important than work?

976
00:55:00,648 --> 00:55:01,748
Ms. Park.

977
00:55:02,208 --> 00:55:04,348
We'll be filming
a lot of scenes tomorrow.

978
00:55:04,348 --> 00:55:06,277
Please make sure
to memorize your lines.

979
00:55:09,248 --> 00:55:11,857
(Please make sure
to memorize your lines.)

980
00:55:14,328 --> 00:55:15,757
Is she drinking?

981
00:55:16,757 --> 00:55:18,898
What if it affects
the shoot tomorrow?

982
00:55:19,697 --> 00:55:21,368
We have a lot of scenes to film!

983
00:55:30,808 --> 00:55:33,177
I'm really sorry
about my mother the other day.

984
00:55:34,007 --> 00:55:35,547
You must've been deeply hurt.

985
00:55:36,177 --> 00:55:38,618
Thank you for letting it slide
and coming here today.

986
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:41,587
Sure.

987
00:55:42,248 --> 00:55:44,018
Please forget what my mother said.

988
00:55:44,887 --> 00:55:46,857
That's not what she usually does.

989
00:55:48,027 --> 00:55:50,757
Anyway, it won't happen again.

990
00:55:52,197 --> 00:55:53,967
What am I doing here now?

991
00:55:54,898 --> 00:55:56,297
Why did I come here?

992
00:56:00,438 --> 00:56:02,438
You seem to like watching musicals.

993
00:56:03,237 --> 00:56:05,708
Once you finish your drama,
"Straightforward Romance,"

994
00:56:05,708 --> 00:56:07,148
why don't we go to New York
and watch musicals?

995
00:56:07,777 --> 00:56:08,777
Pardon?

996
00:56:11,378 --> 00:56:13,118
Well... That's...

997
00:56:13,348 --> 00:56:14,387
Mr. Gong.

998
00:56:15,587 --> 00:56:17,657
It's quite late.

999
00:56:17,657 --> 00:56:19,657
I'm doing the shoot
early in the morning tomorrow.

1000
00:56:19,657 --> 00:56:21,387
I should get going.

1001
00:56:21,387 --> 00:56:22,527
Is that so?

1002
00:56:23,757 --> 00:56:26,598
Then do you want me
to rearrange the filming schedule?

1003
00:56:26,898 --> 00:56:27,898
What?

1004
00:56:28,527 --> 00:56:30,797
Gosh, no. It's all right.

1005
00:56:30,797 --> 00:56:32,268
You don't have to do that.

1006
00:56:32,268 --> 00:56:33,607
I'll get going then.

1007
00:56:33,607 --> 00:56:34,768
Wait.

1008
00:56:47,947 --> 00:56:48,947
Do Ra.

1009
00:56:49,688 --> 00:56:52,157
This is for you. Please accept it.

1010
00:56:53,217 --> 00:56:56,757
I'd like to go out with you.

1011
00:56:57,197 --> 00:56:58,927
Why are you being like this?

1012
00:56:59,558 --> 00:57:02,228
You're making me
really uncomfortable.

1013
00:57:05,737 --> 00:57:06,967
Uncomfortable?

1014
00:57:07,708 --> 00:57:08,837
Yes.

1015
00:57:09,407 --> 00:57:10,737
I just came here today...

1016
00:57:10,737 --> 00:57:13,407
because of the unfortunate thing
that happened the other day.

1017
00:57:13,407 --> 00:57:14,808
I just wanted to patch things up...

1018
00:57:14,808 --> 00:57:16,177
when you called me.

1019
00:57:23,317 --> 00:57:25,087
I thought you came...

1020
00:57:25,087 --> 00:57:27,757
because you were interested in me.

1021
00:57:31,128 --> 00:57:33,697
I think you are far too good
for a woman like me.

1022
00:57:34,297 --> 00:57:36,697
You will meet
someone better than me.

1023
00:57:38,467 --> 00:57:40,438
I shouldn't have come here today.

1024
00:57:41,067 --> 00:57:44,177
I'm sorry I gave you the wrong idea.

1025
00:57:45,308 --> 00:57:46,438
But that's not what I meant.

1026
00:57:50,677 --> 00:57:51,717
Do Ra.

1027
00:57:53,317 --> 00:57:56,047
Please don't go.
We need to talk some more.

1028
00:57:56,587 --> 00:57:57,817
Why are you doing this?

1029
00:57:57,817 --> 00:57:58,887
Do Ra.

1030
00:57:59,118 --> 00:58:01,757
I really like you.

1031
00:58:01,757 --> 00:58:03,188
Just try going out with me once.

1032
00:58:03,427 --> 00:58:04,958
I'm a decent guy.

1033
00:58:04,958 --> 00:58:06,598
I'm sure I'll be nice to you.

1034
00:58:06,598 --> 00:58:07,668
So...

1035
00:58:10,027 --> 00:58:11,737
please give me a chance.

1036
00:58:12,067 --> 00:58:13,498
Forget about my mother.

1037
00:58:14,907 --> 00:58:16,137
I promise.

1038
00:58:20,648 --> 00:58:22,277
Why are you being like this?

1039
00:58:23,748 --> 00:58:25,717
I said I wasn't interested.

1040
00:58:25,878 --> 00:58:27,487
I don't want this!

1041
00:58:29,648 --> 00:58:30,918
Why don't you like me...

1042
00:58:31,918 --> 00:58:33,487
when I made my feelings
for you clear?

1043
00:58:36,788 --> 00:58:37,828
Mr. Gong?

1044
00:58:38,958 --> 00:58:40,527
Is it because
I'm the son of a mistress?

1045
00:58:41,467 --> 00:58:43,067
Is it because
I'm a CEO who gets paid?

1046
00:58:43,498 --> 00:58:44,598
Why don't you like me?

1047
00:58:45,368 --> 00:58:47,137
Are you looking down on me too?

1048
00:58:50,007 --> 00:58:51,007
I...

1049
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:55,078
I'm truly sorry.

1050
00:58:57,018 --> 00:58:59,418
I'll get going, then.

1051
00:59:44,728 --> 00:59:45,958
What am I doing here?

1052
00:59:48,067 --> 00:59:49,197
Have I lost my mind?

1053
00:59:54,268 --> 00:59:55,308
Pil Seung?

1054
00:59:57,777 --> 01:00:00,748
Pil Seung, is that you?

1055
01:00:10,087 --> 01:00:11,118
Pil Seung.

1056
01:00:12,018 --> 01:00:13,418
Please take me elsewhere.

1057
01:00:13,558 --> 01:00:15,527
What's wrong? Did something happen?

1058
01:00:15,527 --> 01:00:17,828
Pil Seung, please.
Take me away from here.

1059
01:00:18,297 --> 01:00:19,927
Sure. Let's go.

1060
01:00:21,697 --> 01:00:23,168
Jin Taek!

1061
01:00:24,337 --> 01:00:25,498
Jin Taek.

1062
01:00:26,567 --> 01:00:28,538
Gong Jin Taek, my brother!

1063
01:00:30,337 --> 01:00:33,848
My gosh, Jin Dan.
What has gotten into you?

1064
01:00:34,107 --> 01:00:36,348
How much did you have to drink?

1065
01:00:36,407 --> 01:00:37,478
Jin Taek!

1066
01:00:38,418 --> 01:00:39,717
Jin Taek...

1067
01:00:40,648 --> 01:00:42,288
Gong Jin Taek, my brother!

1068
01:00:42,447 --> 01:00:45,257
Jin Dan, one shouldn't
drink himself into oblivion.

1069
01:00:45,257 --> 01:00:46,487
What's the matter with you?

1070
01:00:51,058 --> 01:00:53,828
Jin Dan, it seems as though
you're wasted.

1071
01:00:54,168 --> 01:00:55,467
You should rest.

1072
01:00:55,467 --> 01:00:56,527
That's right!

1073
01:00:58,038 --> 01:00:59,837
I'm wasted.

1074
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:03,107
Yes, I'm wasted.

1075
01:01:04,378 --> 01:01:05,938
I didn't think...

1076
01:01:07,148 --> 01:01:09,478
I'd be able to talk to you
while sober,

1077
01:01:10,447 --> 01:01:12,018
so I came home wasted.

1078
01:01:14,547 --> 01:01:15,587
Jin Taek.

1079
01:01:16,918 --> 01:01:18,657
You aren't our father's only son.

1080
01:01:20,058 --> 01:01:21,757
I, Gong Jin Dan,

1081
01:01:24,398 --> 01:01:26,157
am also his son.

1082
01:01:28,168 --> 01:01:29,168
Mom,

1083
01:01:30,027 --> 01:01:31,467
was my father someone else?

1084
01:01:32,538 --> 01:01:35,538
Am I not his son? Is that it?

1085
01:01:35,538 --> 01:01:36,907
You must've lost your mind.

1086
01:01:37,208 --> 01:01:38,708
What nonsense are you spewing?

1087
01:01:38,708 --> 01:01:40,378
Go to your room right now.

1088
01:01:40,378 --> 01:01:42,078
I'm Father's son too,

1089
01:01:44,518 --> 01:01:46,817
so why am I not treated as one?

1090
01:01:48,688 --> 01:01:49,717
Jin Taek.

1091
01:01:51,317 --> 01:01:53,618
Why won't you let me have
what Father gave me?

1092
01:01:55,487 --> 01:01:59,598
This is exactly why
others look down on me.

1093
01:02:00,697 --> 01:02:03,368
Until when will this continue?

1094
01:02:03,598 --> 01:02:05,067
Until when?

1095
01:02:07,137 --> 01:02:10,107
If this is how it's going to be,

1096
01:02:12,038 --> 01:02:13,607
I'll sue you.

1097
01:02:14,478 --> 01:02:15,607
I'll sue you!

1098
01:02:15,607 --> 01:02:17,418
You imbecile.

1099
01:02:18,378 --> 01:02:20,378
Chairman Gong, I'm sorry about this.

1100
01:02:20,547 --> 01:02:23,047
My gosh. Get upstairs this instant.

1101
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:25,487
Why are you apologizing?

1102
01:02:25,587 --> 01:02:28,657
- I'm going to speak my mind now!
- Stop it.

1103
01:02:28,757 --> 01:02:30,958
Goodness me.

1104
01:02:34,427 --> 01:02:37,438
Auntie, please go back to sleep.

1105
01:02:38,368 --> 01:02:40,038
That was the alcohol talking.

1106
01:02:40,567 --> 01:02:42,507
As if.

1107
01:02:42,808 --> 01:02:44,438
He wasn't wrong about any of it.

1108
01:02:46,277 --> 01:02:48,308
Look at what has happened
to this family.

1109
01:02:49,978 --> 01:02:51,547
They say that
marrying the wrong woman...

1110
01:02:51,547 --> 01:02:53,118
could ruin an entire family.

1111
01:02:53,748 --> 01:02:56,018
How upsetting is this?

1112
01:03:07,967 --> 01:03:08,998
Have some of this.

1113
01:03:10,567 --> 01:03:11,967
Right. Thanks.

1114
01:03:17,438 --> 01:03:18,637
I finally feel like
I can breathe again.

1115
01:03:20,748 --> 01:03:24,177
Tell me. You were meeting
Mr. Gong this evening.

1116
01:03:25,047 --> 01:03:26,317
What happened with him?

1117
01:03:30,958 --> 01:03:33,118
I only agreed to meet with him...

1118
01:03:34,887 --> 01:03:36,958
to make you jealous...

1119
01:03:37,228 --> 01:03:39,027
since you kept saying...

1120
01:03:39,027 --> 01:03:40,728
you didn't like me.

1121
01:03:42,328 --> 01:03:44,168
I was wrong to do so.

1122
01:03:44,768 --> 01:03:46,337
That was a mistake.

1123
01:03:48,168 --> 01:03:49,737
Why did you do something like that?

1124
01:03:49,907 --> 01:03:51,978
Whatever. This is all your fault.

1125
01:03:51,978 --> 01:03:54,708
- I'm holding you responsible.
- Hey, it's Park Do Ra.

1126
01:03:55,177 --> 01:03:56,578
Come on. No way.

1127
01:03:56,578 --> 01:03:58,148
I think you're right.

1128
01:03:58,478 --> 01:03:59,918
- You're Park Do Ra, aren't you?
- Wait.

1129
01:03:59,918 --> 01:04:01,387
- Can we take photos?
- She isn't Park Do Ra.

1130
01:04:01,387 --> 01:04:02,618
- I'm a fan.
- Can you look at us?

1131
01:04:02,618 --> 01:04:03,648
- Do Ra.
- Do Ra.

1132
01:04:03,648 --> 01:04:04,717
Hey, it's Bi Bi.

1133
01:04:04,857 --> 01:04:05,857
What?

1134
01:04:06,587 --> 01:04:07,857
- What the...
- Do Ra!

1135
01:04:07,857 --> 01:04:09,257
- Do Ra!
- Do Ra!

1136
01:04:09,257 --> 01:04:11,857
- Wait for us.
- Take photos with us.

1137
01:04:12,628 --> 01:04:14,268
- Do Ra!
- Do Ra!

1138
01:04:14,398 --> 01:04:16,927
- Stop.
- Let's take photos.

1139
01:04:16,927 --> 01:04:18,268
- Do Ra!
- Do Ra!

1140
01:04:18,268 --> 01:04:20,498
- Seriously?
- Take photos with us.

1141
01:04:20,567 --> 01:04:22,237
- Do Ra, please.
- We're fans.

1142
01:04:22,237 --> 01:04:23,808
- Come on.
- Take photos with us.

1143
01:04:23,808 --> 01:04:25,507
Don't go.

1144
01:05:07,217 --> 01:05:09,947
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1145
01:05:13,087 --> 01:05:15,527
(I am a complete moron.)

1146
01:05:42,248 --> 01:05:43,887
Hand it over to Jin Dan.

1147
01:05:43,887 --> 01:05:45,788
Angel Investment Corp. is Jin Dan's,

1148
01:05:45,788 --> 01:05:47,458
so who are you to keep it from him?

1149
01:05:47,458 --> 01:05:49,628
I'll think of you as my mother...

1150
01:05:49,628 --> 01:05:51,197
and serve you indefinitely.

1151
01:05:51,228 --> 01:05:52,927
What brings you by my place?

1152
01:05:52,927 --> 01:05:55,128
Look into Soo Yeon's past for me.

1153
01:05:55,128 --> 01:05:57,197
What was she up to
before she married Jin Taek?

1154
01:05:57,197 --> 01:05:58,868
My pounding heart,

1155
01:05:58,998 --> 01:06:00,668
calm down.

1156
01:06:00,768 --> 01:06:01,967
You can't do this.

1157
01:06:02,507 --> 01:06:03,907
Don't be concerned by her.

1158
01:06:03,907 --> 01:06:06,978
I will love you
even if it means I must be alone.

1159
01:06:06,978 --> 01:06:09,708
I'll head straight for you.

1160
01:06:09,708 --> 01:06:11,817
I can't explain everything to you,

1161
01:06:12,177 --> 01:06:13,348
but we can't be together.

1162
01:06:14,418 --> 01:06:16,387
