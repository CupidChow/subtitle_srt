(Episode 4)

3
00:00:11,673 --> 00:00:14,383
(Park Do Ra, I missed you!)

00:00:14,383 --> 00:00:16,912
(Coy and chic, Park Do Ra)

5
00:00:16,912 --> 00:00:17,982
Do Ra!

6
00:00:17,982 --> 00:00:19,683
- Here she is.
- She's here.

7
00:00:23,422 --> 00:00:25,753
Do Ra, you're beautiful.

8
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:29,597
(Do Ra, welcome back. I missed you.)

9
00:00:30,796 --> 00:00:32,606
Do Ra!

10
00:00:49,587 --> 00:00:51,356
- Do Ra!
- Do Ra.

11
00:00:52,457 --> 00:00:54,227
Do Ra, you're stunning.

12
00:01:00,896 --> 00:01:03,466
Do Ra, I love you.

13
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:06,006
You're the best.

14
00:01:06,237 --> 00:01:08,106
- Do Ra!
- My gosh.

15
00:01:08,106 --> 00:01:09,707
You're stunning.

16
00:01:15,077 --> 00:01:16,517
I might die of exhaustion.

17
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:18,116
I feel cold.

18
00:01:21,887 --> 00:01:23,987
Come on. Get driving already.

19
00:01:24,657 --> 00:01:25,957
Do you want me to spend the night here?

20
00:01:25,957 --> 00:01:28,756
Do Ra, take care!

21
00:01:30,497 --> 00:01:31,926
Do Ra!

22
00:01:39,506 --> 00:01:41,577
How can they make me wear
such shabby clothes?

23
00:01:42,377 --> 00:01:43,707
Hire someone different.

24
00:01:43,707 --> 00:01:45,146
How long do we have left on the contract?

25
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:46,506
They can dress you
on one additional occasion,

26
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,517
but they offered double
to stay on board as your stylist.

27
00:01:48,517 --> 00:01:49,616
Should we still turn it down?

28
00:01:49,616 --> 00:01:50,616
Double the amount?

29
00:01:51,387 --> 00:01:52,387
Really?

30
00:01:54,786 --> 00:01:55,857
Then I guess they should stay on board.

31
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,827
At least tell them to dress me better.

32
00:02:03,797 --> 00:02:07,426
(Park Do Ra airport)

33
00:02:07,426 --> 00:02:09,467
(Park Do Ra Looking Effortlessly Cool)

34
00:02:09,467 --> 00:02:10,937
What I wore will be sold out once again.

35
00:02:11,407 --> 00:02:13,166
It's only because I wore these clothes.

36
00:02:24,176 --> 00:02:25,917
Darn, I'm exhausted.

37
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:27,846
This is tiring.

38
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:31,227
Jae Dong, are we heading home?

39
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:34,896
You have a short photo shoot first.

40
00:02:36,396 --> 00:02:38,126
Are you out of your mind?

41
00:02:38,126 --> 00:02:40,167
How can I do a photo shoot
looking like this?

42
00:02:40,966 --> 00:02:42,096
Was it my mom who scheduled it?

43
00:02:42,697 --> 00:02:43,697
Yes.

44
00:02:45,436 --> 00:02:47,137
She's killing me.

45
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,836
It's not like the gig pays that much.

46
00:02:51,577 --> 00:02:53,646
Also, Do Ra...

47
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,616
What now?

48
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:57,746
You have a meeting tomorrow
with the "Straightforward Romance" team...

49
00:02:57,746 --> 00:02:59,246
to discuss the leading role.

50
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:03,525
But I said I didn't want
to be in that series.

51
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:07,855
Must I, Park Do Ra, be in that series
when they're offering next to nothing?

52
00:03:08,494 --> 00:03:10,265
Also, the male lead is Cha Bong Soo.

53
00:03:10,265 --> 00:03:11,534
He's not my type.

54
00:03:12,094 --> 00:03:13,735
What a sleaze of a womanizer.

55
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,135
He smells like grease,

56
00:03:15,564 --> 00:03:17,434
so how am I supposed
to act like we're in love?

57
00:03:17,434 --> 00:03:19,705
Ms. Baek already had a meal
with the head of the production house...

58
00:03:19,705 --> 00:03:21,205
and the director to seal the deal.

59
00:03:21,205 --> 00:03:22,244
My mom did that?

60
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,575
Yes, so what do you want me to do?

61
00:03:28,444 --> 00:03:29,515
What else?

62
00:03:30,414 --> 00:03:32,955
Get me to the broadcasting station.

63
00:03:33,754 --> 00:03:34,754
Right now.

64
00:03:43,865 --> 00:03:45,765
Victory. Good day, sir.

65
00:03:58,374 --> 00:03:59,374
Hold on.

66
00:03:59,814 --> 00:04:02,184
You want me to work
on "Straightforward Romance" with Jin Gu?

67
00:04:02,985 --> 00:04:04,385
Do Young...

68
00:04:05,085 --> 00:04:07,515
was hospitalized
for being at risk for a miscarriage.

69
00:04:08,055 --> 00:04:10,784
I constantly nagged her
to take better care of herself.

70
00:04:10,885 --> 00:04:12,224
No TV series...

71
00:04:12,224 --> 00:04:14,395
is worth running around
regardless of her condition.

72
00:04:16,164 --> 00:04:17,365
So what can we do?

73
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:20,094
You're the only one we have...

74
00:04:21,564 --> 00:04:22,664
who can work on "Straightforward Romance."

75
00:04:24,005 --> 00:04:25,034
That's right.

76
00:04:25,034 --> 00:04:27,534
I know you exhausted yourself
filming the daily series...

77
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,245
and that you wrapped it up yesterday...

78
00:04:29,245 --> 00:04:32,315
and were just about
to go backpacking across Europe.

79
00:04:33,614 --> 00:04:34,614
But...

80
00:04:35,185 --> 00:04:36,645
Can't you cancel your plans...

81
00:04:37,315 --> 00:04:38,385
and...

82
00:04:39,284 --> 00:04:40,354
help us out?

83
00:04:44,724 --> 00:04:45,955
Sir,

84
00:04:46,825 --> 00:04:49,625
you didn't have to explain
the situation in such detail.

85
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,195
Do Young's my colleague
and I should take her place...

86
00:04:52,195 --> 00:04:53,864
now that she isn't available.

87
00:04:54,364 --> 00:04:55,835
I'll go backpacking across Europe...

88
00:04:55,835 --> 00:04:58,404
once I successfully wrap up...

89
00:04:58,404 --> 00:04:59,534
"Straightforward Romance."

90
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,904
I'm at your service, Mr. Jang.

91
00:05:01,904 --> 00:05:03,344
You...

92
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:06,245
You always know what to say
and how to say it.

93
00:05:06,445 --> 00:05:09,685
I'm highly fond of you.

94
00:05:11,085 --> 00:05:12,185
Pil Seung.

95
00:05:12,714 --> 00:05:14,614
If you do a good job on this project,

96
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:15,755
I'll...

97
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:20,224
have you do your very first
two-part series.

98
00:05:21,594 --> 00:05:24,125
Do you mean that? Is that a promise?

99
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,464
Of course.

100
00:05:25,464 --> 00:05:28,404
But don't go yapping about it to others.

101
00:05:28,404 --> 00:05:31,234
Anyway, just do a good job
this time around.

102
00:05:31,734 --> 00:05:33,104
You get what I mean, right?

103
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,505
I highly understand, sir. Salute!

104
00:05:43,445 --> 00:05:45,185
Hey, you're here.

105
00:05:45,255 --> 00:05:47,185
I just received Mr. Jang's call.

106
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,955
Director, who is this?

107
00:05:50,724 --> 00:05:52,495
Director Ko, say hi.

108
00:05:52,495 --> 00:05:54,625
I'm sure you know her.
It's actress Park Do Ra.

109
00:05:54,924 --> 00:05:57,294
This is Assistant Director Ko Pil Seung...

110
00:05:57,294 --> 00:05:59,335
who will be joining the team as of today.

111
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:05,234
Hello.

112
00:06:08,174 --> 00:06:09,275
Right.

113
00:06:09,505 --> 00:06:11,404
Hello.

114
00:06:11,775 --> 00:06:13,474
Why do you seem shocked?

115
00:06:13,815 --> 00:06:15,315
Don't you know who Ms. Park is?

116
00:06:15,484 --> 00:06:18,955
Gosh. It's not like that.
Of course I know who she is.

117
00:06:21,854 --> 00:06:23,554
Assistant Director Ko...

118
00:06:23,554 --> 00:06:26,794
must've been stunned by your beauty.

119
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,924
Don't just stand there and sit.

120
00:06:30,294 --> 00:06:31,364
What? Oh, right.

121
00:06:36,034 --> 00:06:38,275
What on earth is going on?

122
00:06:39,005 --> 00:06:40,474
Why is Do Ra here?

123
00:06:40,904 --> 00:06:42,674
Was she cast in this series?

124
00:06:43,044 --> 00:06:45,344
The official meeting is tomorrow,

125
00:06:45,344 --> 00:06:47,945
so what couldn't wait until then?

126
00:06:47,945 --> 00:06:51,984
Do you want to adjust the schedule?

127
00:06:52,414 --> 00:06:54,214
- Or do you...
- No.

128
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:59,224
Director Hong. I don't think
I can appear in this drama.

129
00:06:59,825 --> 00:07:02,794
- I came to tell you that.
- Do Ra.

130
00:07:03,364 --> 00:07:06,265
What do you mean you can't appear?

131
00:07:06,265 --> 00:07:08,505
I clearly said I couldn't do it,

132
00:07:08,505 --> 00:07:10,534
but while I was abroad for work,

133
00:07:10,534 --> 00:07:12,275
someone must've relayed the wrong message.

134
00:07:12,604 --> 00:07:15,104
I'm here because
I thought it would be more appropriate...

135
00:07:15,104 --> 00:07:18,544
if I came to tell you in person
than over the phone.

136
00:07:18,544 --> 00:07:20,145
But Ms. Park.

137
00:07:21,075 --> 00:07:24,385
What are we to do if you back out
when we start shooting this week?

138
00:07:24,385 --> 00:07:25,654
I'm really sorry.

139
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,625
Do excuse me, then.

140
00:07:32,755 --> 00:07:34,895
Goodbye. Bye.

141
00:07:34,895 --> 00:07:36,065
Sorry. Bye.

142
00:07:39,935 --> 00:07:42,404
Do Ra. Ms. Park.

143
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:45,205
Ms. Park!

144
00:07:45,534 --> 00:07:47,375
Do Ra.

145
00:07:47,674 --> 00:07:49,404
Ms. Park!

146
00:07:50,075 --> 00:07:52,875
Will you hear me out? Do Ra.

147
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:55,214
We start this week. You can't...

148
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:58,214
She's unbelievable.

149
00:07:58,414 --> 00:07:59,585
She doesn't care.

150
00:07:59,955 --> 00:08:01,784
Does she think she's that great?

151
00:08:02,984 --> 00:08:05,455
What happens if she backs out?

152
00:08:06,325 --> 00:08:09,125
What do you think? We cast someone else.

153
00:08:09,924 --> 00:08:11,594
There are actors everywhere.

154
00:08:15,505 --> 00:08:17,404
How did I come across her here?

155
00:08:19,474 --> 00:08:20,775
She didn't recognize me.

156
00:08:21,974 --> 00:08:23,344
But then how could she?

157
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,015
I have a new name,

158
00:08:25,445 --> 00:08:27,145
and we last met
when she was a kid 15 years ago.

159
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,784
Mr. Kim. Did Park Do Ra
not sign a contract?

160
00:08:34,854 --> 00:08:36,525
Didn't you tell me she did?

161
00:08:38,654 --> 00:08:40,125
Are you serious?

162
00:08:40,725 --> 00:08:43,595
A verbal contract's
nothing like a signed document!

163
00:08:43,595 --> 00:08:46,294
Park Do Ra backed out.
What will you do about it now?

164
00:08:47,934 --> 00:08:49,005
What?

165
00:08:49,365 --> 00:08:52,235
How do you expect me
to cast someone else now?

166
00:08:52,275 --> 00:08:54,304
I don't care anymore! It's up to you!

167
00:09:00,015 --> 00:09:04,115
Jin Gu. I listed up actresses
who are currently available.

168
00:09:05,485 --> 00:09:07,814
How about Bi Bi?

169
00:09:08,584 --> 00:09:10,084
Park Do Ra's forever rival.

170
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,654
Look at her recent works.
She did pretty well.

171
00:09:13,324 --> 00:09:15,465
She has a slightly different image
from Park Do Ra,

172
00:09:15,725 --> 00:09:17,794
but don't you think she'd be good enough?

173
00:09:17,794 --> 00:09:20,735
Bi Bi or Mi Mi, that isn't our problem!

174
00:09:21,564 --> 00:09:22,664
You can't be here.

175
00:09:22,664 --> 00:09:24,534
Go and get Park Do Ra!

176
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,775
What kind of disaster is this?

177
00:09:32,414 --> 00:09:33,414
Wait.

178
00:09:34,245 --> 00:09:37,515
Pil Seung. Go and get a bouquet.

179
00:09:38,115 --> 00:09:40,385
A massive one
with the most expensive flowers.

180
00:09:41,725 --> 00:09:42,855
A flower bouquet?

181
00:09:46,025 --> 00:09:47,054
Hurry up.

182
00:09:50,895 --> 00:09:51,895
Nice.

183
00:09:52,735 --> 00:09:54,834
Tilt, and raise the product.

184
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,064
Here goes.

185
00:10:05,515 --> 00:10:07,074
We're done. Good job.

186
00:10:07,314 --> 00:10:10,544
- Thank you. Good job.
- Well done.

187
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:12,255
- Thanks a lot.
- Thank you.

188
00:10:13,015 --> 00:10:14,154
Here.

189
00:10:14,154 --> 00:10:16,154
- Thanks.
- The photos look awesome.

190
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:22,294
- Aren't they amazing?
- Yes.

191
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,404
Good job, Ms. Park.

192
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:36,904
What are you doing here, Director Hong?

193
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:39,375
Hey.

194
00:10:40,775 --> 00:10:41,784
What?

195
00:10:45,015 --> 00:10:46,954
We got this for you.

196
00:10:46,985 --> 00:10:50,725
Director. I know why you're here.

197
00:10:51,554 --> 00:10:53,125
I really can't do
"Straightforward Romance."

198
00:10:54,495 --> 00:10:56,725
I debuted as a child actor at 15,

199
00:10:56,725 --> 00:10:59,534
and for the past 15 years,
I never got a single day off.

200
00:11:00,465 --> 00:11:01,904
I really want a break.

201
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:05,005
Oh, dear. I get it. I do.

202
00:11:05,505 --> 00:11:08,304
But could you please consider...

203
00:11:08,304 --> 00:11:09,904
It must've been really hard.

204
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:12,914
You worked for 15 years
without a single day off?

205
00:11:13,544 --> 00:11:15,314
You really do need a break.

206
00:11:21,255 --> 00:11:24,985
I'm well aware of
how hard you worked so far.

207
00:11:25,525 --> 00:11:26,824
But this drama...

208
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:30,025
got a slot because you agreed to do it.

209
00:11:30,395 --> 00:11:31,794
If you back out now,

210
00:11:32,495 --> 00:11:34,934
that'll put us in a difficult position,
so please...

211
00:11:34,934 --> 00:11:37,505
I might consider it
if the pay were higher.

212
00:11:38,635 --> 00:11:41,735
To be honest, it really hurt my pride.

213
00:11:42,174 --> 00:11:45,005
Does it make sense that I get paid
less than Jeon Ga Yeon?

214
00:11:46,145 --> 00:11:48,645
We have a tight budget, so...

215
00:11:49,444 --> 00:11:51,485
I'd love to pay you more if I could.

216
00:11:51,485 --> 00:11:54,284
You cast Cha Bong Soo as the male lead.

217
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,924
I don't think we're a good match.

218
00:11:57,324 --> 00:12:00,294
- Anyway, for various reasons...
- You dislike the male lead too.

219
00:12:00,395 --> 00:12:01,865
Then you really can't do it.

220
00:12:02,465 --> 00:12:04,765
Chemistry is paramount
when it comes to filming a romance.

221
00:12:09,534 --> 00:12:12,204
Anyway, director. I'm really sorry.

222
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,434
Please consider my situation too.

223
00:12:16,174 --> 00:12:17,544
Goodbye, then.

224
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,375
Wait. Ms. Park.

225
00:12:19,715 --> 00:12:21,174
Do Ra.

226
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:22,715
Ms. Park. We...

227
00:12:27,985 --> 00:12:29,284
Ko Pil Seung, you lunatic.

228
00:12:29,985 --> 00:12:31,154
Do you have a screw loose?

229
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:34,525
You followed me here just to mess it up?

230
00:12:34,794 --> 00:12:36,995
Instead of going on your knees to beg,

231
00:12:36,995 --> 00:12:39,434
you say what? "You really need a break?"

232
00:12:39,434 --> 00:12:41,834
We have pride too, Jin Gu.

233
00:12:41,834 --> 00:12:43,765
Must we do this
to someone who isn't interested?

234
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:46,375
And just to remind you,

235
00:12:46,674 --> 00:12:49,145
I tagged along because I had no choice,
because you bugged me to.

236
00:12:49,145 --> 00:12:50,544
You said you couldn't go alone.

237
00:12:50,544 --> 00:12:52,174
You punk!

238
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:55,015
Jin Gu! Am I wrong?

239
00:12:55,145 --> 00:12:57,245
Don't take it out on me. I'm not a drum.

240
00:12:57,245 --> 00:12:59,255
Darn it. You shouldn't hit someone
even with flowers.

241
00:12:59,255 --> 00:13:01,414
Ko Pil Seung. Keep your mouth shut.

242
00:13:03,025 --> 00:13:05,025
This is driving me insane.

243
00:13:10,095 --> 00:13:11,865
Do Ra!

244
00:13:11,965 --> 00:13:13,534
What a relief.

245
00:13:14,664 --> 00:13:16,304
I could've ended up working with her.

246
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:18,735
That's a no.

247
00:13:24,174 --> 00:13:26,074
My goodness.

248
00:13:26,215 --> 00:13:30,515
This looks so pretty and luxurious.

249
00:13:34,385 --> 00:13:35,385
Gosh.

250
00:13:35,924 --> 00:13:37,385
My word.

251
00:13:38,054 --> 00:13:40,495
Women who buy things like this
without thinking twice.

252
00:13:40,924 --> 00:13:43,095
I wonder what kind of luck
they were born with.

253
00:13:45,064 --> 00:13:46,235
- Oh, dear.
- Ma'am.

254
00:13:46,794 --> 00:13:48,064
You look amazing.

255
00:13:49,534 --> 00:13:52,235
Do I? Thanks. I'll come by again.

256
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:54,674
Okay. I'll call when we get something new.

257
00:13:54,674 --> 00:13:57,044
I saw that woman somewhere.

258
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,674
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

259
00:14:01,444 --> 00:14:02,444
Hey.

260
00:14:05,284 --> 00:14:07,554
It's Do Ra's mom, that witch.

261
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,554
Hey, you. Excuse me.

262
00:14:10,424 --> 00:14:11,885
Goodness. What are you doing?

263
00:14:12,525 --> 00:14:13,995
It is you.

264
00:14:13,995 --> 00:14:16,664
Look who's here.

265
00:14:16,824 --> 00:14:19,995
I met my enemy after all this time.

266
00:14:20,334 --> 00:14:22,164
Ms. Baek, it's me.

267
00:14:22,765 --> 00:14:24,505
- Don't you know me?
- Gosh.

268
00:14:24,605 --> 00:14:26,975
Let go of me. You got the wrong person.

269
00:14:26,975 --> 00:14:29,904
As if I got the wrong person.

270
00:14:30,105 --> 00:14:31,775
You lived with us, but 15 years ago,

271
00:14:31,775 --> 00:14:34,745
you ran away
in the middle of the night. That's you.

272
00:14:34,745 --> 00:14:37,145
You should take a better look at people.

273
00:14:37,145 --> 00:14:39,454
- That's not me, so let go of me.
- Oh, gosh.

274
00:14:39,454 --> 00:14:42,025
Oh, dear. Why, that gold digger...

275
00:14:42,025 --> 00:14:44,125
Stop her! Get that gold digger!

276
00:14:44,424 --> 00:14:45,625
You there!

277
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:50,125
That evil fraud.

278
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:54,265
Where did that gold digger disappear to?

279
00:14:54,365 --> 00:14:55,965
I'm sure she came this way.

280
00:15:03,174 --> 00:15:04,345
Is it not this way?

281
00:15:05,574 --> 00:15:06,715
Is it that way?

282
00:15:15,255 --> 00:15:16,684
What just happened?

283
00:15:16,985 --> 00:15:19,294
How did we end up meeting here?

284
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:24,794
Who is that crazy woman
calling a gold digger?

285
00:15:26,294 --> 00:15:28,194
How come nothing works these days?

286
00:15:30,505 --> 00:15:31,505
Oh, my gosh.

287
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:37,875
What?

288
00:15:39,275 --> 00:15:41,044
Is something wrong, Mom?

289
00:15:41,245 --> 00:15:43,184
No. What is it? Why did you call?

290
00:15:45,784 --> 00:15:46,784
What?

291
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:48,985
What did you say?

292
00:15:49,284 --> 00:15:53,194
Do Ra said she wouldn't do
"Straightforward Romance?"

293
00:15:55,495 --> 00:15:57,595
Mom. You want me to do that "at least?"

294
00:15:57,995 --> 00:15:59,895
Don't you care about my pride?

295
00:15:59,934 --> 00:16:02,605
Why should I get paid
less than Jeon Ga Yeon?

296
00:16:02,605 --> 00:16:05,164
It's not a bad deal.

297
00:16:05,334 --> 00:16:07,505
It's not bad enough to wound your pride.

298
00:16:07,505 --> 00:16:09,174
And what's the point of not working?

299
00:16:09,245 --> 00:16:10,975
You should work while they let you.

300
00:16:11,074 --> 00:16:12,544
What do you mean what's the point?

301
00:16:12,544 --> 00:16:14,475
I can't work for that.

302
00:16:14,475 --> 00:16:16,084
So don't bring me just any project.

303
00:16:17,284 --> 00:16:20,755
I've been feeling strange lately
and I don't feel like working.

304
00:16:21,485 --> 00:16:24,784
I'm going to New York where Do Jun is
for about six months.

305
00:16:25,355 --> 00:16:27,895
What? For that long?

306
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:30,595
You're out of your mind. That's nonsense.

307
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:32,934
Why is it nonsense? I can rest if I want.

308
00:16:33,934 --> 00:16:35,704
I earned a lot over the years.

309
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:38,564
Wait, Do Ra. Ms. Park.

310
00:16:38,804 --> 00:16:41,005
I told the production house
and the director you'd do it.

311
00:16:41,005 --> 00:16:44,505
So this time,
for your mom's pride and face,

312
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:46,375
will you please do it?

313
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:48,574
No. I don't want to do it.

314
00:16:48,814 --> 00:16:50,584
I made it very clear.

315
00:16:50,745 --> 00:16:52,985
Wait, Do Ra.

316
00:16:52,985 --> 00:16:56,025
These days, a one-month hiatus
is enough to make you fall into oblivion.

317
00:16:56,025 --> 00:16:58,485
What if you lose your job?

318
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:00,355
There are a lot of
young and pretty actresses out there.

319
00:17:00,355 --> 00:17:02,625
It's not like
you can stay in your 20s forever.

320
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:06,064
You can't be a top actress forever,
you silly thing.

321
00:17:06,434 --> 00:17:07,834
You need to strike while the iron is hot!

322
00:17:07,834 --> 00:17:10,164
There's a right time for everything.

323
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:13,405
Mom, Do Ra doesn't want
to do "Straightforward Romance?"

324
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,905
What if she steps away?

325
00:17:15,905 --> 00:17:17,005
It will be a big problem.

326
00:17:17,005 --> 00:17:20,114
What if she doesn't do this drama?

327
00:17:20,114 --> 00:17:21,144
What's wrong with her?

328
00:17:21,144 --> 00:17:23,344
Hey, Do Sik.
Go ahead and tell her to do it.

329
00:17:23,344 --> 00:17:24,485
Hurry and go.

330
00:17:24,485 --> 00:17:26,314
- She wouldn't listen to me.
- Just go. Hey.

331
00:17:26,314 --> 00:17:29,054
Seriously, this can't be happening.

332
00:17:29,324 --> 00:17:31,925
- This is hilarious.
- I'm the prettiest in this town.

333
00:17:33,624 --> 00:17:34,894
I'm home.

334
00:17:35,124 --> 00:17:37,025
Hey, my son. You're home now.

335
00:17:37,025 --> 00:17:38,025
- Hey.
- Did you eat dinner?

336
00:17:38,064 --> 00:17:39,064
I grabbed something to eat.

337
00:17:39,064 --> 00:17:40,794
- Have some fruit.
- My goodness.

338
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:43,064
Hey, listen.

339
00:17:43,064 --> 00:17:45,235
I just saw that lady.

340
00:17:45,235 --> 00:17:46,804
- My gosh.
- What's wrong, Mom?

341
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:49,544
Who did you see? Who is the lady?

342
00:17:49,544 --> 00:17:52,675
- Do Ra's mom. That vixen.
- What?

343
00:17:52,675 --> 00:17:54,515
You know the gold digger.

344
00:17:55,215 --> 00:17:58,344
What? Did you see Do Ra's mom?

345
00:17:59,455 --> 00:18:01,784
Mom, where did you see her?

346
00:18:01,884 --> 00:18:04,384
When I went out today,

347
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:05,925
I had spicy naengmyeon
with half-dried pollack...

348
00:18:05,925 --> 00:18:07,755
at a cafeteria in a department store.

349
00:18:07,755 --> 00:18:09,124
Then I went upstairs...

350
00:18:09,124 --> 00:18:10,564
to some luxury brand stores...

351
00:18:10,564 --> 00:18:12,265
to walk it off
while looking at some clothes.

352
00:18:12,265 --> 00:18:14,894
And there was a woman...

353
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:16,965
dressed up in expensive designer clothes.

354
00:18:16,965 --> 00:18:20,735
She was carrying a lot of shopping bags
in her both hands.

355
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:22,034
So I wondered...

356
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:25,275
what made a woman like her so happy.

357
00:18:25,275 --> 00:18:26,915
I was watching her with envy.

358
00:18:27,814 --> 00:18:30,215
And it turned out...

359
00:18:30,745 --> 00:18:33,685
she was Do Ra's mom, that vixen.

360
00:18:33,685 --> 00:18:34,715
Are you serious?

361
00:18:35,185 --> 00:18:36,324
Yes.

362
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:38,995
So I talked to her. "Look who's here."

363
00:18:38,995 --> 00:18:40,925
"Aren't you Do Ra's mom?"

364
00:18:41,655 --> 00:18:43,064
Then she said no.

365
00:18:43,064 --> 00:18:46,294
"You got the wrong person."
She said that and ran away.

366
00:18:46,294 --> 00:18:47,564
She ran away?

367
00:18:47,695 --> 00:18:49,205
Yes, she did.

368
00:18:49,205 --> 00:18:51,364
She ran away because it was her.

369
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:53,074
If it wasn't her, why would she run away?

370
00:18:54,574 --> 00:18:56,844
Pil Seung, while working
at the broadcasting station,

371
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,745
have you ever run into Do Ra?

372
00:18:59,745 --> 00:19:02,884
What? Why do you ask?

373
00:19:02,884 --> 00:19:04,485
You know why.

374
00:19:04,485 --> 00:19:06,554
Do Ra's mom and your grandfather...

375
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,685
She flirted with Mr. Kim
and wheedled 30,000 dollars out of him.

376
00:19:11,685 --> 00:19:14,155
We have to get the money back.

377
00:19:14,155 --> 00:19:15,695
Hey, Pil Seung.

378
00:19:16,064 --> 00:19:17,824
You work at a broadcasting station,

379
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:20,165
so you can get Park Do Ra's number, right?

380
00:19:20,265 --> 00:19:21,495
You should get it.

381
00:19:22,364 --> 00:19:24,534
Pil Seung, there's no need.

382
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:27,374
Even if you see her at work,

383
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,735
don't even act like you know her.

384
00:19:29,275 --> 00:19:31,844
Don't act like he knows her? Why not?

385
00:19:31,844 --> 00:19:35,784
Mother, please stop talking about her now.

386
00:19:35,784 --> 00:19:38,344
Why do you keep bringing that up
when we're about to move on?

387
00:19:38,814 --> 00:19:41,485
Whenever I hear about Do Ra's mom,

388
00:19:41,485 --> 00:19:43,225
it makes my blood boil.

389
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:46,925
That's all the more reason
why we should get the money back.

390
00:19:46,925 --> 00:19:49,525
Hey, it was 30,000 dollars 15 years ago.

391
00:19:49,525 --> 00:19:51,394
It was a huge amount of money back then.

392
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:53,495
With the interest added,

393
00:19:53,495 --> 00:19:55,705
it's over 100,000 dollars now.

394
00:19:55,705 --> 00:19:59,235
I don't want to get involved
with her anymore.

395
00:19:59,334 --> 00:20:02,604
And I don't want to do anything
that can harm Dad's reputation...

396
00:20:02,604 --> 00:20:04,604
just to get the money back.

397
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:06,175
My goodness.

398
00:20:06,175 --> 00:20:07,844
Hey. Sun Young.

399
00:20:07,844 --> 00:20:10,644
You think 100,000 dollars is nothing?

400
00:20:12,084 --> 00:20:14,554
How can we give up on such big money?

401
00:20:14,554 --> 00:20:17,155
We should at least get the principal back.

402
00:20:17,255 --> 00:20:20,594
That brat is all dressed up
in designer clothes.

403
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,364
Doesn't it make you upset at all?

404
00:20:22,525 --> 00:20:25,225
Mom, will you please stop that?

405
00:20:27,265 --> 00:20:30,165
Why would I stop?
It wouldn't hurt to have more money.

406
00:20:31,134 --> 00:20:33,235
But Sun Young says no.

407
00:20:33,235 --> 00:20:34,874
If I were her, I would say the same thing.

408
00:20:49,405 --> 00:20:52,145
Ma Ri, try this.

409
00:20:52,716 --> 00:20:55,385
The tteokgalbi tastes really good.

410
00:20:55,385 --> 00:20:56,786
You like this.

411
00:20:57,415 --> 00:20:59,456
Dad, don't try to lure me.

412
00:20:59,456 --> 00:21:02,325
No matter what you do,
I won't fall for that.

413
00:21:02,526 --> 00:21:04,296
I understand you're on a diet,

414
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,395
but you need to eat some protein.

415
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,566
Just eat one piece. Here.

416
00:21:08,566 --> 00:21:09,796
I said no.

417
00:21:09,796 --> 00:21:11,296
Leave her be.

418
00:21:11,466 --> 00:21:14,335
She won't change her mind
until she passes out.

419
00:21:14,405 --> 00:21:15,835
It won't last for long.

420
00:21:16,405 --> 00:21:18,105
If losing weight makes you an idol artist,

421
00:21:18,105 --> 00:21:19,236
I can become one as well.

422
00:21:20,605 --> 00:21:23,145
My gosh. How dare you...

423
00:21:23,145 --> 00:21:24,675
Look at those glaring eyes.

424
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:28,216
Ma Ri.

425
00:21:29,946 --> 00:21:32,256
That silly brat does silly things.

426
00:21:33,216 --> 00:21:34,286
Today,

427
00:21:34,685 --> 00:21:38,026
Jin Dan is going on a date
with the daughter of Jeil Steel.

428
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:39,196
Yes.

429
00:21:40,726 --> 00:21:43,296
The chairman of Jeil Steel
is a good-natured man.

430
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,496
I hope things will go well.

431
00:21:44,665 --> 00:21:46,135
It's something unthinkable.

432
00:21:46,296 --> 00:21:48,736
I'm just glad that he can go on a date
with their daughter.

433
00:21:49,236 --> 00:21:52,135
They know Jin Dan will
take over the angel investment company.

434
00:21:52,135 --> 00:21:53,506
That's why they agreed.

435
00:21:56,575 --> 00:21:58,746
Why isn't Jin Dan coming down?

436
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,375
Did he come home late?

437
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:03,585
What? He left early in the morning.

438
00:22:04,486 --> 00:22:06,516
Grandma is full of hot air.

439
00:22:06,516 --> 00:22:08,355
Everything she says is a lie.

440
00:22:08,855 --> 00:22:10,155
Gosh, Ma Ri.

441
00:22:10,155 --> 00:22:13,395
How could you say such foul things
with your pretty lips?

442
00:22:14,226 --> 00:22:17,095
Ma Ri, I told you
not to say things like that.

443
00:22:17,496 --> 00:22:19,696
Uncle Jin Dan didn't come home last night.

444
00:22:19,736 --> 00:22:22,405
Why did you lie
that he left early in the morning?

445
00:22:22,405 --> 00:22:25,236
You could've just said
that he didn't come home.

446
00:22:25,236 --> 00:22:27,905
I think what's foul is your lips.

447
00:22:29,046 --> 00:22:30,046
What?

448
00:22:36,385 --> 00:22:37,415
Cheers.

449
00:22:48,395 --> 00:22:49,966
Why do you like me?

450
00:22:50,665 --> 00:22:52,095
Give me three reasons.

451
00:22:52,466 --> 00:22:53,806
I don't need more than that.

452
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:56,365
Why do I like you?

453
00:22:57,135 --> 00:23:00,075
First, you're good-looking.

454
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:03,405
Second, you buy me expensive bags.

455
00:23:03,405 --> 00:23:06,276
Third, you buy me a lot of clothes.

456
00:23:06,976 --> 00:23:07,986
Hey.

457
00:23:09,115 --> 00:23:10,986
I really like that.

458
00:23:13,115 --> 00:23:16,655
I like someone honest and straightforward.

459
00:23:20,296 --> 00:23:22,796
Gong Jin Dan!

460
00:23:22,796 --> 00:23:25,296
- Open the door.
- My gosh.

461
00:23:25,736 --> 00:23:27,806
What? Who's that?

462
00:23:28,536 --> 00:23:30,466
- My mom.
- Open it.

463
00:23:31,905 --> 00:23:33,135
Open it this instant.

464
00:23:34,306 --> 00:23:35,405
Jin Dan.

465
00:23:35,405 --> 00:23:36,605
Hey, Mom.

466
00:23:36,776 --> 00:23:39,316
You didn't go to work today.
What are you doing here?

467
00:23:40,216 --> 00:23:41,716
Listen, Mom.

468
00:23:41,845 --> 00:23:43,516
Which brat is it this time?

469
00:23:43,516 --> 00:23:45,956
Where is she? Where did you hide her?

470
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,155
I didn't hide anyone.

471
00:23:48,155 --> 00:23:49,825
I had something to think about,

472
00:23:49,825 --> 00:23:51,095
so I was staying in a hotel room alone
to chill out.

473
00:23:51,095 --> 00:23:53,155
Isn't this nice, Mom? Look.

474
00:23:53,395 --> 00:23:54,966
My gosh. What is this?

475
00:23:55,395 --> 00:23:57,865
Hey, Gong Jin Dan.
Is this how you chill out?

476
00:23:58,296 --> 00:24:00,766
I can't believe this. Where's the brat?

477
00:24:00,766 --> 00:24:02,405
- Mom.
- Come on out this instant!

478
00:24:02,405 --> 00:24:04,405
I guess
it's from the guest from yesterday.

479
00:24:04,405 --> 00:24:06,006
Seriously, I was here alone.

480
00:24:06,006 --> 00:24:07,976
So, Mom, please wait in the lobby.

481
00:24:07,976 --> 00:24:10,776
I'll get changed and go down. Okay?

482
00:24:10,915 --> 00:24:12,675
Mom, look at you.

483
00:24:12,675 --> 00:24:14,385
Your makeup looks great today.

484
00:24:14,385 --> 00:24:15,585
You're pretty.

485
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:16,915
Look at you.

486
00:24:17,486 --> 00:24:18,516
My goodness.

487
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:26,226
Hello, Mother.

488
00:24:36,006 --> 00:24:37,476
You're going on a blind date today.

489
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,206
What do you think you're doing...

490
00:24:39,206 --> 00:24:41,145
with such a lousy girl in broad daylight?

491
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:43,075
I said I wouldn't go on a date.

492
00:24:44,075 --> 00:24:45,976
I don't like that.

493
00:24:46,675 --> 00:24:48,986
I prefer NS.

494
00:24:48,986 --> 00:24:50,915
NS? What's that?

495
00:24:53,556 --> 00:24:55,825
I prefer to meet someone
in a natural setting.

496
00:24:56,526 --> 00:24:58,556
I want a fateful encounter.

497
00:24:58,556 --> 00:25:00,496
NS, my foot.

498
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:02,726
When will you grow up?

499
00:25:03,165 --> 00:25:05,135
Do you think your brother doesn't know
you're being like this?

500
00:25:05,466 --> 00:25:08,306
This is why he wouldn't let you
take over the angel investment company.

501
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:09,405
Because you're being like this.

502
00:25:09,405 --> 00:25:11,206
What am I supposed to do then?

503
00:25:11,206 --> 00:25:13,135
The heart wants what the heart wants.

504
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:16,546
How can you do this to me?

505
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:19,875
I've lived only for you.

506
00:25:21,546 --> 00:25:24,155
At the age of 21,
in the flower of my youth,

507
00:25:25,016 --> 00:25:26,855
I met your dad
who was a lot older than me.

508
00:25:27,556 --> 00:25:29,786
I was held in contempt for that.

509
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:33,325
You have no idea
the indignity I've had to suffer.

510
00:25:40,905 --> 00:25:42,706
Don't you even feel pity for me?

511
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:53,645
All right, fine.

512
00:25:54,145 --> 00:25:55,915
So stop talking about your life at 21.

513
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,056
I'll go on the blind date.

514
00:25:59,885 --> 00:26:01,125
I'll meet her.

515
00:26:02,385 --> 00:26:03,456
Do you mean that?

516
00:26:04,226 --> 00:26:05,256
I'll agree to it.

517
00:26:08,496 --> 00:26:09,566
Jin Dan.

518
00:26:09,966 --> 00:26:12,236
It wasn't easy to set up this blind date.

519
00:26:12,996 --> 00:26:15,006
If you marry into the Jeil Steel family,

520
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:17,135
your brother will see you differently.

521
00:26:17,736 --> 00:26:19,675
Your brother won't be able
to look down on you...

522
00:26:19,675 --> 00:26:22,075
once you have in-laws who have your back.

523
00:26:23,075 --> 00:26:24,375
Do you understand what I'm saying?

524
00:26:24,645 --> 00:26:27,115
I get it, Mom, so let it rest.

525
00:26:28,415 --> 00:26:29,546
All right, son.

526
00:26:29,816 --> 00:26:32,115
I booked the salon for you, so get ready.

527
00:26:32,286 --> 00:26:33,456
You can't afford to be late.

528
00:26:58,746 --> 00:27:00,516
Gosh, I'm sorry.

529
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,925
I was looking at my phone
and didn't see you.

530
00:27:07,925 --> 00:27:09,925
That's all right.
I was looking at my phone as well.

531
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:14,095
Hold on. I think I recognize you.

532
00:27:14,996 --> 00:27:17,796
Are you the famous Park Do Ra?

533
00:27:19,635 --> 00:27:21,335
Yes, I'm Park Do Ra.

534
00:27:22,466 --> 00:27:23,605
Anyway, thanks.

535
00:27:27,806 --> 00:27:28,845
Watch out.

536
00:27:34,915 --> 00:27:35,946
What the...

537
00:27:37,085 --> 00:27:38,115
Are you all right?

538
00:27:39,786 --> 00:27:42,256
Yes, I'm fine.

539
00:27:45,155 --> 00:27:46,556
What are you doing up there?

540
00:27:46,796 --> 00:27:48,196
You almost hurt someone.

541
00:27:48,365 --> 00:27:49,825
I'm so sorry.

542
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:53,696
You almost hurt yourself
while helping me out.

543
00:27:54,405 --> 00:27:56,066
Are you okay? I bet that startled you.

544
00:27:56,665 --> 00:27:59,476
Yes, I'm fine. I'm glad you're okay.

545
00:28:00,536 --> 00:28:01,546
Then...

546
00:28:03,546 --> 00:28:04,645
Hold on a second.

547
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:08,685
You literally saved my life,

548
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:12,816
so could I have your number?

549
00:28:13,016 --> 00:28:14,526
I'd like to treat you to a meal.

550
00:28:16,056 --> 00:28:18,895
What do you mean I saved your life? Gosh.

551
00:28:19,425 --> 00:28:21,766
It's all right. Then...

552
00:28:22,996 --> 00:28:23,996
But...

553
00:28:27,395 --> 00:28:30,066
Am I dreaming or what?

554
00:28:31,175 --> 00:28:32,236
My gosh.

555
00:28:32,754 --> 00:28:34,524
(Park Do Ra)

556
00:28:40,294 --> 00:28:42,264
(Queen Mother)

557
00:28:44,163 --> 00:28:48,264
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

558
00:28:59,073 --> 00:29:00,313
Gong Jin Dan,

559
00:29:00,313 --> 00:29:02,083
did you really turn down
the daughter of Jeil Steel's CEO?

560
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:04,353
You imbecile. Would you rather see me die?

561
00:29:04,353 --> 00:29:05,383
How can you blow her off...

562
00:29:05,383 --> 00:29:07,254
when I went out of my way
to set you up with her?

563
00:29:14,563 --> 00:29:17,764
Are you certain
Park Do Ra isn't dating anyone?

564
00:29:18,093 --> 00:29:19,464
That seems to be the case.

565
00:29:19,994 --> 00:29:22,234
Should I look into her life a bit more?

566
00:29:22,234 --> 00:29:23,704
No, this is more than enough.

567
00:29:24,133 --> 00:29:25,803
- You're dismissed.
- Yes, sir.

568
00:29:34,383 --> 00:29:35,583
Mr. Cho, just a second.

569
00:29:37,284 --> 00:29:39,113
Why didn't we sponsor this show?

570
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:41,954
Sorry? Which one?

571
00:29:41,954 --> 00:29:44,994
The series "Straightforward Romance"
which Park Do Ra was cast in.

572
00:29:46,623 --> 00:29:49,593
Oh, that. You turned it down...

573
00:29:49,823 --> 00:29:51,363
saying we shouldn't bother
with trivial investments.

574
00:29:51,734 --> 00:29:52,734
Did I?

575
00:29:55,034 --> 00:29:56,903
As if I would've said that.

576
00:29:57,403 --> 00:30:00,103
Don't you know
that the media content industry...

577
00:30:00,103 --> 00:30:01,103
is one of the most promising fields?

578
00:30:02,504 --> 00:30:04,613
- I want to invest in it.
- Sorry?

579
00:30:04,873 --> 00:30:07,343
I have a feeling this show will be a hit,

580
00:30:07,984 --> 00:30:09,214
so we should invest immediately.

581
00:30:09,843 --> 00:30:11,484
Set up a meeting
with its production house.

582
00:30:12,353 --> 00:30:13,714
Yes, sir.

583
00:30:22,294 --> 00:30:24,024
Yes, I'm Park Do Ra.

584
00:30:28,204 --> 00:30:29,333
I'm feeling dizzy.

585
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,534
I can't believe this woman.

586
00:30:34,403 --> 00:30:36,674
My world is spinning,

587
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:38,244
and I'm feeling dizzy.

588
00:30:41,643 --> 00:30:43,714
Do I have a crush on her?

589
00:30:48,954 --> 00:30:52,393
Tell me. Did you think of a way
to get Park Do Ra back on board?

590
00:30:55,994 --> 00:30:57,764
You see, Jin Gu...

591
00:30:58,194 --> 00:30:59,994
Right, Pil Seung. Speak up.

592
00:31:00,194 --> 00:31:01,534
Do you have any good ideas?

593
00:31:03,264 --> 00:31:05,633
I took the liberty to contact Bi Bi,

594
00:31:06,274 --> 00:31:09,103
and she'll do the show for that amount.

595
00:31:09,103 --> 00:31:12,313
Seriously? I wanted to know
how we can get Park Do Ra back,

596
00:31:12,313 --> 00:31:14,284
so why are you spitting nonsense?

597
00:31:14,284 --> 00:31:15,284
Jin Gu.

598
00:31:16,214 --> 00:31:17,754
I don't know about anything else,

599
00:31:18,284 --> 00:31:21,024
but it's wrong to cling on to an actress
who clearly isn't interested.

600
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:24,454
In this line of work, giving it your best
isn't even enough sometimes.

601
00:31:24,754 --> 00:31:26,254
The viewers can tell...

602
00:31:26,623 --> 00:31:28,393
if the actors' hearts are in it...

603
00:31:28,393 --> 00:31:30,323
or if they're doing it just for the money.

604
00:31:31,563 --> 00:31:32,833
You saw her yesterday.

605
00:31:33,194 --> 00:31:35,063
She ended up questioning her pay.

606
00:31:35,964 --> 00:31:39,373
From what I hear,
Park Do Ra is a money-grubber.

607
00:31:39,373 --> 00:31:41,643
There are rumors about her
doing anything for the right price.

608
00:31:42,903 --> 00:31:44,714
- Really?
- Yes.

609
00:31:45,044 --> 00:31:46,714
Do you know what people call her?

610
00:31:47,274 --> 00:31:49,044
Snark Do Ra.

611
00:31:49,843 --> 00:31:52,553
She must make people real snarky on set...

612
00:31:52,553 --> 00:31:54,214
for people to call her that.

613
00:31:57,424 --> 00:31:59,754
Jin Gu, let's go with Bi Bi instead.

614
00:32:00,194 --> 00:32:01,893
The skinny actress
isn't even that impressive.

615
00:32:02,424 --> 00:32:03,823
I'm not fond of Park Do Ra at all.

616
00:32:07,534 --> 00:32:08,663
Ko Pil Seung, hey.

617
00:32:09,163 --> 00:32:10,333
- Victory.
- Victory.

618
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:12,903
- Sir.
- Director Hong, you're here too.

619
00:32:13,004 --> 00:32:14,303
Sir, what brings you by?

620
00:32:14,303 --> 00:32:16,873
Wait. Hasn't Park Do Ra arrived yet?

621
00:32:17,444 --> 00:32:19,544
Sorry? Park Do Ra?

622
00:32:19,544 --> 00:32:21,113
Yes, we agreed to meet here.

623
00:32:25,214 --> 00:32:28,053
Ms. Park, I see you were already here.

624
00:32:31,524 --> 00:32:32,524
Hi.

625
00:32:35,964 --> 00:32:38,734
Hold on. What's with the overall mood?

626
00:32:45,504 --> 00:32:46,803
- Sir.
- Yes?

627
00:32:47,373 --> 00:32:50,603
I really wanted to take a break,
but since...

628
00:32:51,274 --> 00:32:54,643
you're someone I owe my career to,

629
00:32:55,214 --> 00:32:58,784
I decided to be in the series
out of my loyalty to you.

630
00:32:59,353 --> 00:33:00,454
Right.

631
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:02,224
- But sir...
- Yes?

632
00:33:02,823 --> 00:33:04,994
- I'm sorry.
- About what?

633
00:33:05,954 --> 00:33:06,954
I'm afraid...

634
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:11,093
I can't work with those
who don't trust me.

635
00:33:11,934 --> 00:33:12,934
Trust you?

636
00:33:13,633 --> 00:33:15,133
What do you mean by that?

637
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:18,103
What on earth is she talking about?

638
00:33:20,103 --> 00:33:21,204
Look here.

639
00:33:26,444 --> 00:33:27,744
Curly-haired Assistant Director.

640
00:33:29,714 --> 00:33:32,954
You're right.
I'm skinny and not that impressive.

641
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:36,184
Due to my temper,
I see red and drive people crazy.

642
00:33:37,383 --> 00:33:38,623
Also,

643
00:33:42,994 --> 00:33:44,994
I value money over everything else.

644
00:33:52,073 --> 00:33:56,143
That being said, you can work with Bi Bi
who apparently isn't a money-grubber.

645
00:33:57,303 --> 00:33:58,544
Good luck with her.

646
00:33:59,214 --> 00:34:00,744
I'll get going.

647
00:34:04,143 --> 00:34:06,284
- Ms. Park?
- Have a good day.

648
00:34:06,284 --> 00:34:08,353
Ms. Park? Why you...

649
00:34:08,823 --> 00:34:10,553
Ms. Park!

650
00:34:15,464 --> 00:34:16,924
Are you kidding me?

651
00:34:18,833 --> 00:34:22,763
I may not have gotten down on my knees,

652
00:34:22,763 --> 00:34:24,833
but I begged her to be in this series.

653
00:34:25,033 --> 00:34:27,504
I called her numerous times
to talk her up...

654
00:34:27,703 --> 00:34:30,473
and finally managed to persuade her
due to old times' sake.

655
00:34:32,674 --> 00:34:35,544
But Ko Pil Seung, you ruined it all.

656
00:34:35,743 --> 00:34:38,154
- What are you going to do about it?
- Sir, please.

657
00:34:38,154 --> 00:34:39,953
- Let go of me!
- But...

658
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:42,754
Jun Ho, we already decided
to cast Bi Bi instead,

659
00:34:42,754 --> 00:34:43,984
so please calm down.

660
00:34:44,453 --> 00:34:45,953
What? Bi Bi?

661
00:34:47,964 --> 00:34:48,993
Did Bi Bi agree to it?

662
00:34:48,993 --> 00:34:51,234
Yes, she wants to be in the series.

663
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:53,694
She'll even be on board
at a pay lower than Ms. Park's.

664
00:34:54,663 --> 00:34:56,663
Really? Hold on a second.

665
00:34:57,933 --> 00:35:00,203
Chemistry among the leads
is just as crucial,

666
00:35:00,203 --> 00:35:02,203
and Bi Bi is good friends
with Cha Bong Soo.

667
00:35:02,203 --> 00:35:03,944
Bi Bi's a good fit as well.

668
00:35:06,143 --> 00:35:07,243
Darn it.

669
00:35:10,844 --> 00:35:12,114
I'm sorry, Jin Gu.

670
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:17,583
You...

671
00:35:19,223 --> 00:35:20,324
It's all right.

672
00:35:21,993 --> 00:35:23,493
It's fine. What can we do about it?

673
00:35:24,563 --> 00:35:25,634
It's okay.

674
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,263
It's fine!

675
00:35:31,674 --> 00:35:32,933
No, it's not fine.

676
00:35:35,603 --> 00:35:37,913
Why couldn't Ae Kyo make it today?

677
00:35:39,774 --> 00:35:40,973
She must have other plans.

678
00:35:41,714 --> 00:35:43,643
As in what? Didn't she tell you?

679
00:35:44,013 --> 00:35:46,813
We may live under the same roof,
but we barely run into each other.

680
00:35:47,384 --> 00:35:48,783
That's actually for the best.

681
00:35:48,783 --> 00:35:50,683
Soo Yeon, you're like a saint...

682
00:35:50,683 --> 00:35:53,453
to stomach
all of Ae Kyo's temper tantrums.

683
00:35:55,094 --> 00:35:56,263
- By the way...
- Yes?

684
00:35:56,263 --> 00:35:57,993
Is your son still busy these days?

685
00:35:57,993 --> 00:35:59,533
Of course.

686
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:01,964
He just wrapped up a daily TV series,

687
00:36:01,964 --> 00:36:05,873
and another team asked him
to work with them right away.

688
00:36:06,973 --> 00:36:08,174
Gosh.

689
00:36:08,174 --> 00:36:11,074
The broadcasting station must need my son
for things to run smoothly.

690
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:14,783
He's so busy
that I barely get to see him myself.

691
00:36:14,783 --> 00:36:17,143
Your son must be talented.

692
00:36:17,143 --> 00:36:18,884
He's doing job after job.

693
00:36:19,283 --> 00:36:22,054
These days, broadcasting stations
offer six-figure deals...

694
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:24,654
to work with talented TV show directors.

695
00:36:25,324 --> 00:36:27,154
Yes, I heard that too.

696
00:36:27,453 --> 00:36:30,993
But Pil Seung is still learning the ropes
and has a long way to go.

697
00:36:31,364 --> 00:36:33,364
He needs more experience in the field.

698
00:36:33,964 --> 00:36:37,663
Your son must be extremely popular
among women.

699
00:36:37,663 --> 00:36:40,603
The broadcasting station
must be crawling with such beauties.

700
00:36:41,004 --> 00:36:43,103
But tell him
to watch out for the opposite sex.

701
00:36:43,103 --> 00:36:45,714
Some girls these days
can be so much trouble.

702
00:36:45,714 --> 00:36:48,143
Tell me about it. That worries me as well.

703
00:36:48,384 --> 00:36:50,513
Especially since my son
is quite the looker.

704
00:36:50,884 --> 00:36:52,654
You're helpless when it comes to him.

705
00:36:52,654 --> 00:36:54,254
Unbelievable.

706
00:36:55,554 --> 00:36:59,123
Sun Young, since your son
has a promising career...

707
00:36:59,123 --> 00:37:01,464
My cousin's daughter works at a bank.

708
00:37:01,663 --> 00:37:02,964
Should I set those two up?

709
00:37:03,623 --> 00:37:09,103
Does she work at a bank? That'd be nice.

710
00:37:13,074 --> 00:37:15,703
I shouldn't set Pil Seung up
on a blind date?

711
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:20,044
But someone who works at a bank
is a nice catch.

712
00:37:20,274 --> 00:37:21,274
Why not?

713
00:37:22,143 --> 00:37:24,683
Isn't he a bit young to have his elders...

714
00:37:24,683 --> 00:37:26,513
set him up on blind dates?

715
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:29,524
Once he becomes a main director,

716
00:37:29,524 --> 00:37:32,324
he'll have better options
in the dating pool.

717
00:37:32,694 --> 00:37:36,393
I'll make sure to set him up
with a girl from a better family.

718
00:37:37,063 --> 00:37:38,194
Do you mean that?

719
00:37:38,194 --> 00:37:40,433
Of course. He's your son, isn't he?

720
00:37:40,993 --> 00:37:44,504
Also, I watched him grow up
since he was a boy.

721
00:37:45,533 --> 00:37:47,904
I want him to marry into a decent family.

722
00:37:48,044 --> 00:37:49,504
Soo Yeon, my gosh.

723
00:37:50,804 --> 00:37:53,714
So make sure he doesn't date
just about anyone.

724
00:37:54,143 --> 00:37:56,884
Got it. You promised me that.

725
00:37:57,565 --> 00:37:58,565
All right.

726
00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:00,348
Let's cheers to that.

727
00:38:01,848 --> 00:38:02,848
Cheers.

728
00:38:03,479 --> 00:38:04,519
Thanks.

729
00:38:08,184 --> 00:38:10,695
Director Hong, thank you so much.

730
00:38:10,695 --> 00:38:13,264
I promise I'll give it my all.

731
00:38:13,264 --> 00:38:15,394
I'm already in love with the character,

732
00:38:15,394 --> 00:38:17,864
and I know I can do a good job.

733
00:38:19,465 --> 00:38:20,835
We're more grateful.

734
00:38:20,835 --> 00:38:23,175
You agreed to join the project
the second we offered you the part.

735
00:38:23,505 --> 00:38:25,074
It was a no-brainer.

736
00:38:25,074 --> 00:38:26,775
It's a great series,

737
00:38:26,775 --> 00:38:28,804
and I'd be working with Cha Bong Soo.

738
00:38:29,244 --> 00:38:31,045
You're also the director,

739
00:38:31,045 --> 00:38:33,445
so the pleasure is all mine.

740
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:35,644
I'll contact the production house, then.

741
00:38:35,644 --> 00:38:38,085
Sure, please tell them
I'll sign the contract right away.

742
00:38:39,855 --> 00:38:42,525
Mr. Kim, speak of the devil.

743
00:38:43,795 --> 00:38:46,525
Yes, Mr. Kim.
I'm here with Ms. Bi Bi and...

744
00:38:48,465 --> 00:38:49,635
What was that?

745
00:39:00,344 --> 00:39:01,405
Just a second.

746
00:39:12,255 --> 00:39:13,255
Jin Gu.

747
00:39:14,324 --> 00:39:16,094
Jin Gu, what's going on?

748
00:39:22,425 --> 00:39:24,864
Jin Gu, what is it?

749
00:39:28,534 --> 00:39:30,434
- Mr. Jang?
- You, Ko Pil Seung.

750
00:39:31,034 --> 00:39:32,844
Come to see me immediately.

751
00:39:33,344 --> 00:39:34,344
Sorry?

752
00:39:35,175 --> 00:39:36,215
Right now?

753
00:39:40,085 --> 00:39:41,315
Have a seat.

754
00:39:41,815 --> 00:39:43,114
It's okay. Have a seat.

755
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,394
Pil Seung, what now?

756
00:39:53,494 --> 00:39:56,635
Because of you, we might have to scrap
"Straightforward Romance" altogether.

757
00:39:58,034 --> 00:40:00,534
The main investor will step away...

758
00:40:01,235 --> 00:40:03,204
if Park Do Ra isn't the lead.

759
00:40:05,905 --> 00:40:07,844
But there are previous investors,

760
00:40:08,545 --> 00:40:09,644
so once we start filming...

761
00:40:09,945 --> 00:40:11,045
Once we start filming?

762
00:40:12,414 --> 00:40:14,445
Are you going to pay
the production costs yourself?

763
00:40:14,914 --> 00:40:17,684
Now that our main investor is backing out,

764
00:40:17,684 --> 00:40:21,355
the other investors
want to drop out as well.

765
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:23,195
We'll have to scrap the project...

766
00:40:24,394 --> 00:40:26,164
unless we get her on board.

767
00:40:26,864 --> 00:40:29,864
We don't have a backup show
to play in its time slot,

768
00:40:30,434 --> 00:40:31,735
so what do we do?

769
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:35,664
I'll make sure to get Park Do Ra on board!

770
00:40:35,864 --> 00:40:37,135
That's it!

771
00:40:37,704 --> 00:40:39,644
Clean up your own darn mess.

772
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:45,815
I can't reach Park Do Ra's manager,
so I'm going to her agency instead.

773
00:40:45,815 --> 00:40:48,144
Please get me her home address.

774
00:40:48,385 --> 00:40:51,184
Assistant Director Ko,
Park Do Ra's leaving for the US.

775
00:40:51,355 --> 00:40:52,355
What?

776
00:40:53,324 --> 00:40:55,554
The US? Where exactly?

777
00:40:55,554 --> 00:40:58,155
I called a manager
who's friends with her manager.

778
00:40:58,155 --> 00:41:00,525
She leaves for New York at 7 p.m.,

779
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:03,195
so her manager is currently
driving her to Incheon Airport.

780
00:41:03,195 --> 00:41:04,335
What can we do...

781
00:41:10,675 --> 00:41:12,034
You've got to be kidding me.

782
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:19,215
Darn it. This is killing me.

783
00:41:20,514 --> 00:41:22,445
What's with the darn traffic?

784
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:29,425
Wait. Sir, hold on!

785
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:39,235
Sir, please drive faster.

786
00:41:42,264 --> 00:41:43,735
I really appreciate this.

787
00:41:53,085 --> 00:41:54,144
(Park Do Ra's Manager)

788
00:41:56,815 --> 00:41:58,355
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

789
00:41:58,355 --> 00:42:00,255
- You will be redirected to voicemail.
- What now?

790
00:42:00,255 --> 00:42:01,655
Please leave a message after the tone.

791
00:42:01,655 --> 00:42:02,894
Do Ra, please.

792
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:05,255
Where are you?

793
00:42:06,295 --> 00:42:07,465
Did you already go through
the security checkpoint?

794
00:42:10,835 --> 00:42:11,894
Park Do Ra!

795
00:42:16,405 --> 00:42:17,574
Ms. Park.

796
00:42:23,445 --> 00:42:24,445
Did...

797
00:42:25,474 --> 00:42:28,045
Did you call me casually
by my name just now?

798
00:42:29,045 --> 00:42:31,284
I'm sorry about that.

799
00:42:31,284 --> 00:42:32,885
Things were urgent, and I blurted it out.

800
00:42:33,625 --> 00:42:36,425
Ms. Park, I'm truly sorry.

801
00:42:36,695 --> 00:42:37,894
I must not have been in my right mind.

802
00:42:37,894 --> 00:42:40,465
For speaking ill of you,

803
00:42:40,465 --> 00:42:42,094
I apologize from the heart.

804
00:42:44,094 --> 00:42:45,135
What...

805
00:42:46,505 --> 00:42:49,405
Did you come all this way
to apologize for that?

806
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:54,045
I didn't say what I did
to drag your name through the mud.

807
00:42:54,844 --> 00:42:57,614
You've been working nonstop for 15 years,

808
00:42:58,215 --> 00:43:00,114
so I wanted you to take a break
since I felt bad for you.

809
00:43:00,114 --> 00:43:02,715
Look here,
Curly-haired Assistant Director.

810
00:43:03,684 --> 00:43:05,985
Do you think you're making any sense?

811
00:43:07,155 --> 00:43:09,625
You called me Snark Do Ra
because you felt bad for me?

812
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,355
You called me a money-grubber
behind my back...

813
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:12,695
because you felt bad for me?

814
00:43:14,164 --> 00:43:15,164
What?

815
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:20,534
Ms. Park, I'm sorry about everything.

816
00:43:21,264 --> 00:43:22,735
You can speak ill of me...

817
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:25,704
and punch me if that's what you want.
However,

818
00:43:26,974 --> 00:43:28,074
"Straightforward Romance"...

819
00:43:29,304 --> 00:43:30,744
Please be in our series.

820
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:34,085
If you agree to be on the show,

821
00:43:34,085 --> 00:43:37,215
I'll cater to your every need.

822
00:43:37,885 --> 00:43:38,885
Forget it.

823
00:43:39,454 --> 00:43:40,485
Ms. Park.

824
00:43:40,485 --> 00:43:42,985
- Who do you think you're grabbing?
- Hey.

825
00:43:50,065 --> 00:43:51,534
If you leave like this,

826
00:43:52,994 --> 00:43:54,105
I'll be fired.

827
00:43:56,434 --> 00:43:58,204
Think of it as saving a man's career.

828
00:43:59,005 --> 00:44:00,275
Please.

829
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:06,045
Are you kidding me?

830
00:44:12,655 --> 00:44:13,655
Hey, Mom.

831
00:44:16,894 --> 00:44:17,894
What?

832
00:44:19,125 --> 00:44:20,724
You signed the contract
for "Straightforward Romance?"

833
00:44:22,625 --> 00:44:24,894
Who are you to sign it on my behalf?

834
00:44:25,594 --> 00:44:27,405
Mom, what's the matter with you?

835
00:44:30,804 --> 00:44:33,105
What? A blank check?

836
00:44:39,315 --> 00:44:40,315
Is that for real?

837
00:44:42,344 --> 00:44:45,155
They'll pay me any amount I want?

838
00:44:53,094 --> 00:44:55,764
Okay. Fine, I'll be there.

839
00:44:56,565 --> 00:44:58,335
I'll come over. Hang up.

840
00:45:02,534 --> 00:45:03,635
We're going back.

841
00:45:05,304 --> 00:45:07,144
- We are?
- Yes.

842
00:45:19,485 --> 00:45:20,554
Ms. Park.

843
00:45:22,485 --> 00:45:23,894
Thank you very much...

844
00:45:24,394 --> 00:45:26,795
for deciding to do
"Straightforward Romance."

845
00:45:31,034 --> 00:45:32,034
Hey, you.

846
00:45:37,375 --> 00:45:39,105
Don't let me see you again.

847
00:45:40,175 --> 00:45:41,244
Okay?

848
00:46:09,364 --> 00:46:11,434
The lunatic. The idiot.

849
00:46:12,204 --> 00:46:14,804
He'll never meet someone like
the heiress of Jeil Steel.

850
00:46:15,045 --> 00:46:16,375
How dare he ruin that opportunity?

851
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:19,545
I should kill him. He'll pay for this.

852
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:24,554
Goodness.

853
00:46:27,554 --> 00:46:30,155
Hey, isn't that Ma Ri?

854
00:46:32,295 --> 00:46:34,724
My gosh. She's 26 years old,

855
00:46:34,965 --> 00:46:37,135
and she's with
snotty-nosed elementary school kids?

856
00:46:37,135 --> 00:46:38,335
- Are you sure?
- Hey.

857
00:46:39,434 --> 00:46:40,764
Gong Ma Ri!

858
00:46:43,875 --> 00:46:46,135
What are you doing with these kids?

859
00:46:47,105 --> 00:46:50,045
We're going to a karaoke. Why?

860
00:46:50,275 --> 00:46:52,375
You'll go to a karaoke
with elementary school kids?

861
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:56,344
Are you leeching off her
because you think...

862
00:46:56,585 --> 00:46:58,054
she's not that smart?

863
00:46:58,054 --> 00:47:01,485
Grandma. You can't say that to my friends.

864
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,085
We split the bill.

865
00:47:03,724 --> 00:47:04,824
She's your grandma?

866
00:47:05,394 --> 00:47:07,664
- She's a grandma.
- She looks like one.

867
00:47:08,224 --> 00:47:09,934
I don't. I look like an auntie.

868
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:11,864
I told you not to call me "Grandma."

869
00:47:12,434 --> 00:47:15,735
Last time, you complained
that I didn't call you that.

870
00:47:15,735 --> 00:47:19,005
Ma Ri, so is she your grandma or aunt?

871
00:47:21,074 --> 00:47:22,074
The truth is,

872
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:25,974
she's my grandpa's
second woman. A mistress.

873
00:47:25,974 --> 00:47:27,844
- A mistress?
- A second woman?

874
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:31,284
But she was high-school friends
with my mom,

875
00:47:31,284 --> 00:47:33,114
so I call her both Grandma and Auntie.

876
00:47:33,114 --> 00:47:34,385
I'm not sure what she is.

877
00:47:34,385 --> 00:47:36,355
Hey! You nasty piece of work.

878
00:47:36,554 --> 00:47:37,824
What did you say?

879
00:47:40,724 --> 00:47:41,965
Stop it, granny.

880
00:47:41,965 --> 00:47:43,965
No, lady. No, Auntie!

881
00:47:45,235 --> 00:47:48,005
Mom, Dad.

882
00:47:48,304 --> 00:47:50,675
Ma Ri. What is it?

883
00:47:51,005 --> 00:47:52,605
Who did this to you?

884
00:47:54,074 --> 00:47:56,875
Ma Ri. What happened?

885
00:47:57,574 --> 00:48:01,284
Uncle Jin Dan's mom. Grandma Ae Kyo.

886
00:48:03,114 --> 00:48:06,414
She grabbed me by the hair
in front of my new friends.

887
00:48:06,414 --> 00:48:08,985
- What?
- She pulled out a fistful.

888
00:48:08,985 --> 00:48:11,695
She pinched me and hit me too.

889
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:16,264
Is that true?

890
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:20,304
Did you grab Ma Ri's hair
and hit and pinch her?

891
00:48:20,534 --> 00:48:22,934
Yes. I did all that.

892
00:48:23,434 --> 00:48:25,335
Ma Ri told a group
of elementary school kids...

893
00:48:25,505 --> 00:48:28,474
that I was her grandpa's
second woman and mistress.

894
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:29,704
That's why.

895
00:48:29,875 --> 00:48:31,414
Should I let her off
for talking like that?

896
00:48:32,614 --> 00:48:34,144
What? Ma Ri.

897
00:48:34,844 --> 00:48:36,514
Did you say that?

898
00:48:37,485 --> 00:48:40,684
Yes. She is Grandpa's
second woman and mistress.

899
00:48:41,224 --> 00:48:42,585
It's the truth.

900
00:48:44,594 --> 00:48:45,894
See?

901
00:48:46,795 --> 00:48:48,994
You two look down on me,

902
00:48:49,324 --> 00:48:51,335
so Ma Ri does too.

903
00:48:51,735 --> 00:48:53,534
- Hong Ae Kyo.
- What?

904
00:48:54,764 --> 00:48:56,704
How dare you call me by my name?

905
00:48:57,235 --> 00:49:00,074
Yes. I'm your dad's
second woman and mistress.

906
00:49:00,375 --> 00:49:02,275
You should call me "Mother."

907
00:49:02,275 --> 00:49:05,114
How dare you call me by name?
What kind of unfilial son are you?

908
00:49:06,074 --> 00:49:07,914
Treat me like that again,

909
00:49:07,914 --> 00:49:09,485
and I'll make you pay.

910
00:49:32,934 --> 00:49:36,204
Mom. What if they kick me out?

911
00:49:36,574 --> 00:49:39,074
You stupid thing.

912
00:49:39,315 --> 00:49:42,644
You shouldn't have said such things
just because you could.

913
00:49:44,255 --> 00:49:46,724
Should I have put up with
Ma Ri calling me...

914
00:49:47,954 --> 00:49:50,255
a second woman and mistress in public?

915
00:49:51,295 --> 00:49:54,965
Everyone looks down on me because of that.

916
00:49:55,764 --> 00:49:58,994
You stupid thing.
Are you upset that's what you are?

917
00:49:59,695 --> 00:50:01,335
It's the truth.

918
00:50:01,835 --> 00:50:05,204
That's the life you made for yourself.
It won't go anywhere.

919
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:07,204
You birdbrain.

920
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:10,614
Must you say that to me in death?

921
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:14,545
Why can't you side with me for once?

922
00:50:32,135 --> 00:50:35,135
What's the matter, honey?

923
00:50:42,074 --> 00:50:43,204
Our Ma Ri.

924
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:48,485
What if she's like this forever?

925
00:50:49,485 --> 00:50:51,284
Look at these photos.

926
00:50:52,755 --> 00:50:55,025
She's with elementary school kids.

927
00:50:55,025 --> 00:50:56,894
She can't mix with people her age.

928
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:01,364
But I can't stop her.

929
00:51:03,965 --> 00:51:05,664
What should we do about Ma Ri?

930
00:51:08,505 --> 00:51:09,605
It's fine.

931
00:51:10,905 --> 00:51:12,775
So what if she has younger friends?

932
00:51:13,474 --> 00:51:16,045
Foreigners make friends
with people of various age groups.

933
00:51:18,344 --> 00:51:19,474
Our daughter...

934
00:51:20,514 --> 00:51:24,155
is pure-hearted enough
to be able to befriend young people.

935
00:51:25,655 --> 00:51:27,224
There's nothing wrong with that.

936
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:30,494
Don't worry, okay?

937
00:51:31,494 --> 00:51:33,724
How can I not worry?

938
00:51:33,724 --> 00:51:35,264
We don't live abroad.

939
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:38,494
Honey.

940
00:51:39,434 --> 00:51:42,235
Whether someone's
in elementary school or middle school,

941
00:51:42,635 --> 00:51:44,204
if Ma Ri likes that person,

942
00:51:45,105 --> 00:51:46,605
that's good enough for me.

943
00:51:48,405 --> 00:51:50,614
As long as Ma Ri's healthy and happy,

944
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:52,545
what more could we want?

945
00:51:54,585 --> 00:51:55,614
Honey.

946
00:51:59,315 --> 00:52:01,454
Outside the operating room that day,

947
00:52:02,425 --> 00:52:03,525
I prayed.

948
00:52:04,755 --> 00:52:06,525
For Ma Ri to be saved.

949
00:52:07,465 --> 00:52:09,224
I promised not to ask for anything else.

950
00:52:11,065 --> 00:52:12,135
Honey.

951
00:52:13,264 --> 00:52:15,264
I still feel the exact same.

952
00:52:16,974 --> 00:52:19,074
Ma Ri's alive and well with us.

953
00:52:20,105 --> 00:52:21,474
We should be grateful.

954
00:52:23,144 --> 00:52:24,215
Let's not...

955
00:52:25,744 --> 00:52:27,485
ask for much more.

956
00:52:42,295 --> 00:52:43,324
It suits her.

957
00:52:45,594 --> 00:52:46,965
Look at this.

958
00:52:56,545 --> 00:52:58,844
Do Ra. You sweet thing.

959
00:52:59,014 --> 00:53:01,385
I knew it. I knew you'd come back.

960
00:53:01,385 --> 00:53:03,315
Mom. It's just this time.

961
00:53:03,315 --> 00:53:05,614
Don't sign any papers on your own again.

962
00:53:05,985 --> 00:53:08,155
Okay, I won't.

963
00:53:09,184 --> 00:53:11,394
Hey, sit down.

964
00:53:11,394 --> 00:53:14,264
I'm tired. What do you want to say now?

965
00:53:14,894 --> 00:53:19,394
Do Ra. The new investing company is
called "Angel."

966
00:53:19,795 --> 00:53:21,635
Do you know the representative?

967
00:53:21,905 --> 00:53:24,034
No, I don't. Why?

968
00:53:24,775 --> 00:53:28,775
Angel said they'd invest in
"Straightforward Romance,"

969
00:53:28,775 --> 00:53:30,375
but only if you're in it.

970
00:53:30,715 --> 00:53:32,215
They said they'd back out if you did.

971
00:53:32,215 --> 00:53:34,684
They told the production house...

972
00:53:34,815 --> 00:53:36,954
to give you whatever pay you asked for.

973
00:53:37,655 --> 00:53:39,454
Really? Is that true?

974
00:53:39,454 --> 00:53:41,655
Yes. It's unbelievable.

975
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:45,025
They must've recognized your talent.

976
00:53:45,025 --> 00:53:46,125
My gosh.

977
00:53:46,155 --> 00:53:47,764
But then,

978
00:53:47,764 --> 00:53:50,934
pretty actresses like you
who can act too are rare.

979
00:53:50,934 --> 00:53:52,735
Not just anyone lands a lead role.

980
00:53:53,394 --> 00:53:55,534
Mom. If we pay off the mortgage...

981
00:53:55,534 --> 00:53:58,704
on the Cheongdam-dong building with this,
how about we buy another building?

982
00:53:59,735 --> 00:54:01,144
How about one in Hongdae?

983
00:54:01,844 --> 00:54:02,844
What?

984
00:54:03,605 --> 00:54:05,414
Yes, let's do that.

985
00:54:05,414 --> 00:54:07,244
I'll look into it.

986
00:54:16,724 --> 00:54:18,255
(KMS Drama Center)

987
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,195
Hey. Ko Pil Seung.

988
00:54:22,864 --> 00:54:24,295
You're the best.

989
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:27,764
I knew you'd win back Park Do Ra.

990
00:54:28,105 --> 00:54:30,835
You went all the way
to the airport to do it.

991
00:54:31,105 --> 00:54:32,434
Good for you.

992
00:54:33,335 --> 00:54:35,074
You do what you set your mind to.

993
00:54:35,974 --> 00:54:38,744
She didn't rejoin the project
because of me.

994
00:54:39,844 --> 00:54:42,315
She changed her mind
because the new investor...

995
00:54:42,315 --> 00:54:43,414
offered a great deal.

996
00:54:43,644 --> 00:54:46,755
Still, it all worked out
because you were there.

997
00:54:48,655 --> 00:54:50,525
Good job. Thanks.

998
00:54:52,494 --> 00:54:53,925
- Mr. Jang.
- Yes?

999
00:54:53,925 --> 00:54:55,565
Can you reassign me to another project?

1000
00:54:55,994 --> 00:54:58,295
Instead of "Straightforward Romance."

1001
00:54:59,195 --> 00:55:00,195
Hey.

1002
00:55:02,005 --> 00:55:04,804
Are you being like this
because I yelled at you earlier?

1003
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:08,574
Things can happen
when you work at a broadcasting station.

1004
00:55:08,574 --> 00:55:09,644
Hey.

1005
00:55:10,105 --> 00:55:13,914
What you're going through now
is no big deal.

1006
00:55:15,144 --> 00:55:16,885
Fine. I'm sorry.

1007
00:55:16,885 --> 00:55:19,385
So go for a drink and shake it off.

1008
00:55:20,155 --> 00:55:21,824
And give "Straightforward Romance"
your best shot.

1009
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:24,255
I'll be watching you.

1010
00:55:24,994 --> 00:55:27,264
For a two-part series. Okay?

1011
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:29,565
Good luck.

1012
00:55:33,735 --> 00:55:35,105
This is driving me crazy.

1013
00:55:36,335 --> 00:55:38,235
I'll keep running into Park Do Ra
during the drama.

1014
00:55:39,675 --> 00:55:41,304
What am I supposed to do?

1015
00:55:43,175 --> 00:55:44,215
No.

1016
00:55:45,244 --> 00:55:46,875
Do Ra doesn't recognize me anyway.

1017
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:49,945
I just need to get through this.

1018
00:55:50,755 --> 00:55:51,755
Only this project.

1019
00:55:54,525 --> 00:55:56,925
Do Ra, your hair is seriously damaged.

1020
00:55:57,394 --> 00:55:59,855
- Really?
- You need to get your hair cut.

1021
00:56:00,525 --> 00:56:01,824
But I'm doing a new drama.

1022
00:56:02,824 --> 00:56:04,494
Then I'll put some nutrients...

1023
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:06,364
into your hair and scalp today.

1024
00:56:06,494 --> 00:56:07,934
- Nice.
- All right.

1025
00:56:13,005 --> 00:56:14,574
My gosh.

1026
00:56:17,215 --> 00:56:18,344
What was that?

1027
00:56:32,554 --> 00:56:33,965
Hey, Cho Bi Bi.

1028
00:56:36,025 --> 00:56:37,764
What do you think you're doing?

1029
00:56:38,894 --> 00:56:40,065
You darn wench.

1030
00:56:40,565 --> 00:56:43,434
You stole "Straightforward Romance"
from me knowing I wanted it.

1031
00:56:43,434 --> 00:56:45,235
You stole "Passionate Girl"
from me last time,

1032
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,905
and you're doing it again!

1033
00:56:55,284 --> 00:56:56,585
This is absurd.

1034
00:56:59,184 --> 00:57:00,355
Hey, Cho Bi Bi.

1035
00:57:01,625 --> 00:57:03,684
It's not like I'm desperate
to steal a role from you.

1036
00:57:04,625 --> 00:57:06,625
I wanted to get some rest,

1037
00:57:06,625 --> 00:57:08,894
so I turned down
"Straightforward Romance."

1038
00:57:08,894 --> 00:57:11,894
But they kept insisting it had to be me.

1039
00:57:12,565 --> 00:57:14,135
The producers, investors,
and directors begged me,

1040
00:57:14,135 --> 00:57:16,204
so I accepted the offer against my will.

1041
00:57:17,375 --> 00:57:18,804
Did you know anything about that?

1042
00:57:19,835 --> 00:57:21,144
What did you say?

1043
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:23,605
Then why did they offer me the role?

1044
00:57:23,605 --> 00:57:25,744
I even had a meeting with the director.

1045
00:57:25,744 --> 00:57:28,614
How would I know
why the director had a meeting with you?

1046
00:57:28,614 --> 00:57:29,914
Maybe he wanted you to fill in for me...

1047
00:57:29,914 --> 00:57:31,485
when I turned it down.

1048
00:57:32,614 --> 00:57:34,324
What did you say?

1049
00:57:34,324 --> 00:57:35,554
And about "Passionate Girl."

1050
00:57:37,795 --> 00:57:39,394
The writer worked on it...

1051
00:57:39,394 --> 00:57:41,525
having me in mind in the first place.

1052
00:57:42,965 --> 00:57:44,364
It takes one to know one.

1053
00:57:44,934 --> 00:57:46,335
It's you who steals roles
from other actresses.

1054
00:57:46,335 --> 00:57:47,864
That doesn't mean I'm like you.

1055
00:57:48,335 --> 00:57:50,065
"Straightforward Romance."

1056
00:57:50,065 --> 00:57:51,974
I know you hit on the main investor...

1057
00:57:51,974 --> 00:57:54,644
to take the role from me!

1058
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:58,144
I bet that's what you learned
from your mom growing up.

1059
00:57:58,144 --> 00:57:59,945
Your mom went around...

1060
00:57:59,945 --> 00:58:01,815
wining and dining people
to get you a role.

1061
00:58:01,815 --> 00:58:04,085
Everyone in this field knows that!

1062
00:58:04,155 --> 00:58:05,155
What?

1063
00:58:08,324 --> 00:58:09,585
Hey!

1064
00:58:09,885 --> 00:58:11,195
- What?
- Wait.

1065
00:58:11,195 --> 00:58:12,494
- Hey!
- Let go of me!

1066
00:58:12,494 --> 00:58:15,494
How dare you say such a thing?
Wining and dining people?

1067
00:58:15,494 --> 00:58:17,195
It's not like I said anything wrong.

1068
00:58:17,195 --> 00:58:19,094
Is there anyone
who doesn't know that in this field?

1069
00:58:19,094 --> 00:58:21,635
Everyone here is well aware of that.

1070
00:58:22,005 --> 00:58:23,804
Have you lost your mind? Get off me!

1071
00:58:23,804 --> 00:58:25,835
- Hey!
- Let go!

1072
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:26,974
Get off me!

1073
00:58:26,974 --> 00:58:30,175
Bi Bi has a crush on Cha Bong Soo.

1074
00:58:30,175 --> 00:58:32,744
That's why she wanted
to do "Straightforward Romance."

1075
00:58:32,744 --> 00:58:34,445
She's mad because you got the part.

1076
00:58:34,885 --> 00:58:36,914
She's afraid you'd take Bong Soo from her.

1077
00:58:36,914 --> 00:58:38,085
What? Now...

1078
00:58:39,554 --> 00:58:42,255
She's being like this
because of Cha Bong Soo, that player?

1079
00:58:42,255 --> 00:58:43,255
Yes.

1080
00:58:43,655 --> 00:58:44,925
My gosh.

1081
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,054
I can't believe this.

1082
00:58:48,695 --> 00:58:50,494
I will never let this slide.

1083
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:52,534
Mom.

1084
00:58:52,965 --> 00:58:55,434
Are you sure you didn't meet anyone
from Angel?

1085
00:58:56,135 --> 00:58:57,275
I didn't meet anyone.

1086
00:59:00,375 --> 00:59:02,644
I don't even know who they are.

1087
00:59:03,144 --> 00:59:04,144
Why do you ask?

1088
00:59:04,344 --> 00:59:07,175
Seriously? Are you sure?

1089
00:59:07,175 --> 00:59:09,184
Of course, I'm sure.

1090
00:59:09,414 --> 00:59:10,885
I thought you knew
someone from the company.

1091
00:59:10,885 --> 00:59:14,184
That's why I asked
if you knew the representative.

1092
00:59:16,125 --> 00:59:17,224
Okay.

1093
00:59:18,525 --> 00:59:20,324
It's all right then. Bye.

1094
00:59:24,264 --> 00:59:25,494
Wine and dine?

1095
00:59:27,164 --> 00:59:28,204
Darn it.

1096
00:59:29,105 --> 00:59:30,775
What should I do with Bi Bi?

1097
00:59:32,574 --> 00:59:34,005
What should I do to get back at her?

1098
00:59:38,815 --> 00:59:39,815
Hang on.

1099
00:59:41,485 --> 00:59:43,914
So Bi Bi has a crush on Cha Bong Soo?

1100
00:59:48,025 --> 00:59:50,585
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1101
00:59:50,585 --> 00:59:52,454
- This is nice.
- Enjoy the food.

1102
00:59:54,295 --> 00:59:58,235
You two sitting side by side
make a good drama already.

1103
00:59:58,635 --> 00:59:59,795
Don't you think so?

1104
00:59:59,795 --> 01:00:01,704
I'm sure our drama will be a big hit.

1105
01:00:01,704 --> 01:00:03,704
Sure. We don't need to worry.

1106
01:00:03,704 --> 01:00:05,335
You two look great together.

1107
01:00:05,335 --> 01:00:06,675
All right.

1108
01:00:06,675 --> 01:00:10,074
Let's try our best
so our new drama will be a big hit.

1109
01:00:10,304 --> 01:00:11,545
Go, "Straightforward Romance!"

1110
01:00:11,545 --> 01:00:13,545
- Go, "Straightforward Romance!"
- Go, "Straightforward Romance!"

1111
01:00:16,244 --> 01:00:18,355
Bong Soo, let's get along well.

1112
01:00:19,784 --> 01:00:20,784
Sure.

1113
01:00:30,364 --> 01:00:31,394
Director Hong.

1114
01:00:32,335 --> 01:00:35,704
I heard Cha Bong Soo refused
to do kissing scenes.

1115
01:00:35,905 --> 01:00:36,905
Is that true?

1116
01:00:37,775 --> 01:00:40,744
How can we make a romantic drama
without a kissing scene?

1117
01:00:40,744 --> 01:00:44,675
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

1118
01:00:46,514 --> 01:00:49,085
Did his girlfriend tell him
not to do kissing scenes?

1119
01:00:49,344 --> 01:00:51,255
What are you talking about?

1120
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:52,684
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1121
01:00:55,054 --> 01:00:58,295
Bi Bi has a crush on Cha Bong Soo.

1122
01:00:58,295 --> 01:01:00,894
That's why she wanted
to do "Straightforward Romance."

1123
01:01:00,894 --> 01:01:02,465
She's mad because you got the part.

1124
01:01:02,994 --> 01:01:04,965
She's afraid you'd take Bong Soo from her.

1125
01:01:04,965 --> 01:01:06,835
I'll make sure to talk him into it.

1126
01:01:06,835 --> 01:01:09,005
I'm good at scenes like that.

1127
01:01:11,835 --> 01:01:14,574
Ms. Park Do Ra and Mr. Cha Bong Soo.

1128
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:16,344
I hope we will get along well.

1129
01:01:16,344 --> 01:01:19,315
The chemistry between the lead roles
is important in a romantic drama.

1130
01:01:19,875 --> 01:01:21,344
So you should get to know each other.

1131
01:01:21,644 --> 01:01:23,184
You know what I mean, right?

1132
01:01:23,315 --> 01:01:24,715
Of course.

1133
01:01:25,255 --> 01:01:26,554
Speaking of which,

1134
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:28,525
the next round is on me.

1135
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:32,994
We're going another round?

1136
01:01:32,994 --> 01:01:34,565
Park Do Ra.

1137
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:37,835
- Park Do Ra.
- Park Do Ra.

1138
01:01:37,835 --> 01:01:40,965
- Park Do Ra.
- Park Do Ra.

1139
01:01:40,965 --> 01:01:42,534
- Park Do Ra.
- Park Do Ra.

1140
01:01:42,664 --> 01:01:43,934
Park Do Ra.

1141
01:01:43,934 --> 01:01:45,275
Cheers.

1142
01:01:45,574 --> 01:01:48,775
The writer worked hard for this project.

1143
01:01:48,875 --> 01:01:50,105
I'll appreciate your cooperation.

1144
01:01:50,914 --> 01:01:52,545
I look forward to your cooperation.

1145
01:01:52,614 --> 01:01:53,614
Let me fill your glass.

1146
01:01:56,414 --> 01:01:58,784
- I'll appreciate your help.
- I'll appreciate your help too.

1147
01:02:07,295 --> 01:02:09,164
Let's sing a song.

1148
01:02:09,164 --> 01:02:11,094
Now that we're here,
we can't just stay quiet like this.

1149
01:02:11,235 --> 01:02:12,434
- Bong Soo.
- Yes?

1150
01:02:12,465 --> 01:02:14,534
Let's go and sing a song.

1151
01:02:14,534 --> 01:02:16,335
- Song?
- Come with me.

1152
01:02:16,335 --> 01:02:18,605
- So Ri, let's go.
- I'm not a good singer.

1153
01:02:18,605 --> 01:02:20,775
Sook Ja, join me. Come here.

1154
01:02:21,974 --> 01:02:23,974
Bong Soo, I know you sing well.

1155
01:02:23,974 --> 01:02:26,074
- Gosh, no.
- You're a good singer.

1156
01:02:37,284 --> 01:02:38,295
Park Do Ra.

1157
01:02:39,494 --> 01:02:40,824
What's with her?

1158
01:02:43,594 --> 01:02:47,295
My gosh. We won't
have to worry about our drama.

1159
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:49,065
They hit it off already.

1160
01:02:49,335 --> 01:02:51,304
Let's warm up a little.

1161
01:02:51,304 --> 01:02:52,405
Let's go.

1162
01:02:55,644 --> 01:03:00,614
<i>I, a charming man loved by everyone</i>

1163
01:03:02,585 --> 01:03:06,554
<i>Fell for one woman</i>

1164
01:03:06,554 --> 01:03:07,585
What?

1165
01:03:08,784 --> 01:03:11,695
What is she doing with a man
whom she just met today?

1166
01:03:11,724 --> 01:03:13,795
What are you waiting for, Pil Seung?
Come here.

1167
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,934
Pil Seung, come on and dance.

1168
01:03:18,695 --> 01:03:21,005
<i>She's so sexy</i>

1169
01:03:23,605 --> 01:03:27,105
<i>- Her face is so dazzling</i>
- Dazzling!

1170
01:03:27,105 --> 01:03:30,375
<i>- Her body is so dazzling</i>
- Dazzling!

1171
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:35,445
<i>Everything about her is dazzling</i>

1172
01:03:37,554 --> 01:03:40,284
<i>Her face has the V-line</i>

1173
01:03:40,985 --> 01:03:43,525
<i>Her body has the S-line</i>

1174
01:03:44,324 --> 01:03:49,224
<i>It's just killing me</i>

1175
01:04:00,034 --> 01:04:01,344
I want to go home.

1176
01:04:03,445 --> 01:04:05,275
I really want to go home.

1177
01:04:07,514 --> 01:04:09,614
Why is everyone so excited?

1178
01:04:10,784 --> 01:04:12,054
When will it be over?

1179
01:04:15,385 --> 01:04:16,385
Hey.

1180
01:04:16,824 --> 01:04:19,454
Hey, Park Do Ra. It's you, right?

1181
01:04:19,894 --> 01:04:20,894
Yes.

1182
01:04:20,894 --> 01:04:22,864
You look a lot prettier in person.

1183
01:04:23,394 --> 01:04:25,364
I can't help it.

1184
01:04:25,364 --> 01:04:27,394
I'll be your fan from this day forth.

1185
01:04:28,135 --> 01:04:31,105
Why don't you come and dance with me?

1186
01:04:31,175 --> 01:04:33,704
Wait. Please let go of this.

1187
01:04:33,804 --> 01:04:35,744
I'm not a bad person.

1188
01:04:35,744 --> 01:04:38,315
I'll be your fan.

1189
01:04:38,315 --> 01:04:41,284
I don't need a fan like you.
Just let go of me.

1190
01:04:43,914 --> 01:04:45,215
You're playing hard to get.

1191
01:04:46,755 --> 01:04:48,655
Do you even know who I am?

1192
01:04:49,255 --> 01:04:51,155
- What?
- Don't act like you're a precious doll...

1193
01:04:51,155 --> 01:04:52,525
when you sell your looks for a living.

1194
01:04:54,565 --> 01:04:55,864
What did you just say?

1195
01:04:56,824 --> 01:04:57,835
What the...

1196
01:04:59,335 --> 01:05:00,335
Let go.

1197
01:05:00,594 --> 01:05:02,235
Apologize to Ms. Park.

1198
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:05,434
You grabbing her arm against her will...

1199
01:05:05,534 --> 01:05:08,574
and throwing that lowly comment at her
are considered assault.

1200
01:05:10,204 --> 01:05:12,275
What you did was caught
on that security camera.

1201
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:16,184
Apologize to her now,
or I'll take you to the police.

1202
01:05:18,014 --> 01:05:19,815
Fine. Ms. Park...

1203
01:05:20,315 --> 01:05:22,485
I'm sorry. I apologize.

1204
01:05:23,355 --> 01:05:24,355
Are we good?

1205
01:05:27,025 --> 01:05:29,224
Actors don't sell
their looks for a living.

1206
01:05:30,965 --> 01:05:33,135
They share their beautiful souls
with the viewers.

1207
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:37,065
What the...

1208
01:05:44,005 --> 01:05:45,014
Are you all right?

1209
01:05:46,844 --> 01:05:50,284
Gosh. Yes, I'm fine.

1210
01:05:52,655 --> 01:05:54,954
Thanks for helping me out.

1211
01:05:57,025 --> 01:05:59,094
Please don't thank me.
I only did what anyone would've done.

1212
01:06:02,264 --> 01:06:03,264
Hold on.

1213
01:06:05,764 --> 01:06:08,835
Where did you come across
a saying that nice?

1214
01:06:10,005 --> 01:06:13,204
"Actors share their beautiful souls
with the viewers."

1215
01:06:14,905 --> 01:06:16,675
Oh, that. Well...

1216
01:06:17,304 --> 01:06:19,144
I didn't hear it
from anyone in particular.

1217
01:06:19,144 --> 01:06:20,574
It just came out.

1218
01:06:29,155 --> 01:06:31,795
Since you helped me out just now,

1219
01:06:31,795 --> 01:06:34,594
I'll forget that you badmouthed me
behind my back.

1220
01:06:35,565 --> 01:06:38,094
Also, we'll be working
on set together, so...

1221
01:06:42,405 --> 01:06:43,704
I hope we get along.

1222
01:06:46,835 --> 01:06:47,844
Right.

1223
01:06:48,045 --> 01:06:51,175
I'm truly ashamed of my actions
and I deeply apologize.

1224
01:06:51,215 --> 01:06:53,474
I hope we get along. Thank you.

1225
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:55,945
Let's get along.

1226
01:07:04,494 --> 01:07:05,954
Curly-haired Assistant Director.

1227
01:07:06,755 --> 01:07:07,764
Yes?

1228
01:07:08,894 --> 01:07:10,065
Have we...

1229
01:07:11,235 --> 01:07:13,295
met before?

1230
01:07:15,704 --> 01:07:16,704
Sorry?

1231
01:07:27,914 --> 01:07:30,585
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1232
01:08:02,914 --> 01:08:04,655
Soo Yeon agreed...

1233
01:08:04,655 --> 01:08:07,085
to set you up with a young lady
from a great family down the road.

1234
01:08:07,085 --> 01:08:08,925
I'll find the woman who's right for me,

1235
01:08:08,925 --> 01:08:11,625
so please mind your business
when it comes to my dating life.

1236
01:08:11,625 --> 01:08:13,954
It doesn't matter if you're careful.
Your life will be ruined...

1237
01:08:13,954 --> 01:08:15,264
if you meet the wrong woman.

1238
01:08:15,324 --> 01:08:16,425
Just you wait, Bi Bi.

1239
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:17,894
You threw a knife at my heart,

1240
01:08:17,894 --> 01:08:19,394
so get ready to have
your heart broken as well.

1241
01:08:19,465 --> 01:08:20,565
She's out of her mind.

1242
01:08:20,565 --> 01:08:21,704
She has completely lost it.

1243
01:08:21,704 --> 01:08:23,565
She's not the same Park Do Ra
I used to know.

1244
01:08:23,565 --> 01:08:25,034
I have something to tell you.

1245
01:08:25,204 --> 01:08:27,805
As you know, we need time
to get to know each other better.

01:08:28,005 --> 01:08:29,944
Park Do Ra, Cha Bong Soo!

1247
01:08:29,944 --> 01:08:32,314
What do you think you're doing
sitting that close to one another?

1248
01:08:32,444 --> 01:08:34,685
Don't cause a scene on set
and please talk it out.
