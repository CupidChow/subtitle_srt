00:00:00,107 --> 00:00:07,482
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:09,007 --> 00:00:10,608
(Episode 16)

3
00:00:10,967 --> 00:00:12,137
What's the deal with you?

4
00:00:13,177 --> 00:00:15,408
What made you do such a thing?

5
00:00:16,226 --> 00:00:17,778
A woman killed herself
because of you.

6
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,747
She was faced
with disgraceful death.

7
00:00:22,048 --> 00:00:23,288
Though it's too late,
you have to reveal the truth.

8
00:00:23,817 --> 00:00:25,387
Tell people what you've done!

9
00:00:26,918 --> 00:00:29,127
I just did as I was told
to get paid!

10
00:00:33,798 --> 00:00:36,197
I was told
I'd get 2,000 dollars a day.

11
00:00:37,968 --> 00:00:38,968
I just did it...

12
00:00:39,438 --> 00:00:41,097
as a part-time job.

13
00:00:44,407 --> 00:00:45,638
Who made you do that?

14
00:00:46,108 --> 00:00:47,877
I don't know.

15
00:00:50,877 --> 00:00:52,718
I didn't know
this would happen to Park Do Ra.

16
00:00:54,178 --> 00:00:55,248
But...

17
00:00:55,947 --> 00:00:57,957
after seeing the news
about her having a sponsor...

18
00:00:59,318 --> 00:01:01,227
and then hearing about her death...

19
00:01:02,587 --> 00:01:05,298
scared me so much
that I hid inside my house.

20
00:01:05,998 --> 00:01:07,227
I haven't even been able to eat.

21
00:01:08,227 --> 00:01:09,267
But...

22
00:01:10,398 --> 00:01:12,537
it's not like I actually killed her.

23
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:17,037
I was paid to play a role
and that's what I did.

24
00:01:26,248 --> 00:01:27,278
Sir,

25
00:01:29,147 --> 00:01:30,548
at least speak the truth.

26
00:01:34,218 --> 00:01:36,888
A woman's reputation
was dragged through the mud...

27
00:01:37,688 --> 00:01:38,728
which led to her death.

28
00:01:41,627 --> 00:01:43,968
That dirty reputation
shouldn't be her legacy.

29
00:01:46,198 --> 00:01:47,198
Sir.

30
00:01:48,407 --> 00:01:49,567
Sir, please.

31
00:01:51,407 --> 00:01:53,478
Please tell the world...

32
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:54,647
that Park Do Ra
wasn't trading sexual favors.

33
00:01:56,847 --> 00:01:58,448
At least let her rest in peace...

34
00:01:59,517 --> 00:02:00,918
by clearing her name.

35
00:02:02,017 --> 00:02:03,647
This is unfair to her.

36
00:02:06,688 --> 00:02:07,858
Sir, please.

37
00:02:09,257 --> 00:02:10,257
All right.

38
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,627
But give me some time.

39
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:18,138
The whole world will condemn me now.

40
00:02:20,397 --> 00:02:22,837
I need time to prepare myself.

41
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:25,908
Okay.

42
00:02:26,307 --> 00:02:29,677
Mister. You must keep your word.

43
00:02:30,647 --> 00:02:31,647
You must.

44
00:02:32,217 --> 00:02:34,247
This is just wrong.

45
00:02:34,617 --> 00:02:37,888
This isn't right.
How are we to go on?

46
00:02:38,418 --> 00:02:41,888
How can I live with you gone?

47
00:02:42,957 --> 00:02:45,098
Even if you hated me that much,

48
00:02:45,527 --> 00:02:47,228
how could you leave me?

49
00:02:47,527 --> 00:02:50,397
How could you
take your life and leave me?

50
00:02:50,728 --> 00:02:53,967
Do Ra...

51
00:02:55,437 --> 00:02:57,237
Do Ra.

52
00:03:01,207 --> 00:03:02,307
Do Ra.

53
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:07,117
Do Ra!

54
00:03:10,288 --> 00:03:12,918
I'm so sorry.

55
00:03:17,658 --> 00:03:18,897
I hope...

56
00:03:20,427 --> 00:03:22,328
you forget all about this life...

57
00:03:23,927 --> 00:03:25,798
and rest in peace where you are.

58
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:34,437
Do Ra...

59
00:03:36,048 --> 00:03:37,848
Let's go now, Mom.

60
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:41,247
Do Jun. Help her up.

61
00:03:41,848 --> 00:03:43,948
Okay. Let's...

62
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:47,957
Let's have a light lunch
at the soft tofu restaurant nearby.

63
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:49,187
Let's go.

64
00:03:49,557 --> 00:03:51,328
Let's go, Do Jun.

65
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:55,927
I won't go with you.

66
00:03:56,967 --> 00:04:00,598
As of this moment,
I'm cutting ties with Mom.

67
00:04:01,038 --> 00:04:02,638
What are you talking about?

68
00:04:03,168 --> 00:04:05,807
What do you mean
you'll cut ties with me?

69
00:04:05,807 --> 00:04:07,307
That sounds so scary.

70
00:04:07,608 --> 00:04:09,548
I can't live without you.

71
00:04:10,478 --> 00:04:14,378
Now that Do Ra's gone,
the three of us must stand together.

72
00:04:14,378 --> 00:04:15,388
Do Ra...

73
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:17,788
died because of you, Mom.

74
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:22,888
I can't forgive you.

75
00:04:25,327 --> 00:04:27,358
Do Jun. How could you...

76
00:04:27,798 --> 00:04:29,668
How could you say that to me?

77
00:04:30,197 --> 00:04:33,637
My heart's already in pieces,
so how could you...

78
00:04:35,437 --> 00:04:39,007
I think I'll hate you even more
if I stay around any longer.

79
00:04:41,077 --> 00:04:42,148
Don't look for me.

80
00:04:43,577 --> 00:04:46,377
- Do Jun!
- Hey. Mom, watch your step.

81
00:04:46,518 --> 00:04:48,048
- Do Jun!
- Do Jun!

82
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:49,947
Do...

83
00:04:51,288 --> 00:04:53,557
- Are you Baek Mi Ja?
- Yes, I am.

84
00:04:53,817 --> 00:04:54,827
Who are you?

85
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,327
I'm a detective.

86
00:04:59,127 --> 00:05:00,958
- You must come with us.
- What?

87
00:05:02,098 --> 00:05:03,997
Baek Mi Ja, you're under arrest...

88
00:05:03,997 --> 00:05:05,437
for embezzlement and fraud.

89
00:05:05,598 --> 00:05:07,997
You can hire a lawyer
and defend yourself.

90
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,937
You can refuse
to make incriminating statements,

91
00:05:09,937 --> 00:05:11,708
and you can ask court
to review your arrest.

92
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:14,307
- Wait. Am I going to prison?
- Come along.

93
00:05:14,307 --> 00:05:17,007
- I'm asking if...
- Ms. Baek.

94
00:05:17,007 --> 00:05:19,018
- Do Sik, call a lawyer.
- Mom.

95
00:05:19,048 --> 00:05:22,018
- Mom.
- I don't want to go to prison.

96
00:05:22,018 --> 00:05:23,987
- Do Sik!
- Mom!

97
00:05:23,987 --> 00:05:25,518
- Do Sik.
- Wait!

98
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:33,827
Are you sure he said
he took the job for 2,000 dollars?

99
00:05:33,927 --> 00:05:35,427
Yes, I heard it clearly.

100
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:37,668
Mister.

101
00:05:38,437 --> 00:05:40,197
- Mister!
- Sir!

102
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:42,137
Hey.

103
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:44,807
Why are you making such a noise?

104
00:05:44,807 --> 00:05:46,937
I can't reach the guy
who lives here.

105
00:05:46,937 --> 00:05:49,177
I heard he packed up
and moved in a hurry...

106
00:05:49,177 --> 00:05:50,307
to go abroad.

107
00:05:50,648 --> 00:05:52,577
He's going abroad? Where to?

108
00:05:52,648 --> 00:05:53,918
The Philippines, was it?

109
00:05:54,048 --> 00:05:55,817
He won't come back.

110
00:06:00,617 --> 00:06:01,987
Hey, Pil Seung.

111
00:06:02,158 --> 00:06:03,757
Let's go to the airport right now.

112
00:06:03,887 --> 00:06:06,197
There's nothing we can do.

113
00:06:06,197 --> 00:06:08,327
We can't find him. Do you know
how many islands there are?

114
00:06:08,898 --> 00:06:12,197
He told me
he took the job for two grand.

115
00:06:12,268 --> 00:06:13,497
That's the truth.

116
00:06:13,497 --> 00:06:16,168
- If you write about that...
- I can't write an article...

117
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:17,968
on hearsay without any proof.

118
00:06:18,507 --> 00:06:19,978
I want an exclusive too,

119
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:21,747
but it's over if the guy ran away.

120
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:28,218
Gosh. If that's really the truth,
poor Park Do Ra was wronged.

121
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,317
You're a real loyal guy.

122
00:06:32,257 --> 00:06:34,518
If she were to see what you did
because you worked together,

123
00:06:34,518 --> 00:06:36,458
I'm sure she'd be grateful.

124
00:06:38,088 --> 00:06:40,598
Hey, wait. There's no point
in going to the airport!

125
00:06:41,627 --> 00:06:44,598
Do Ra. What should Mom do?

126
00:06:44,997 --> 00:06:49,108
How am I to live without you?

127
00:06:51,237 --> 00:06:54,577
Can you stop crying
so I can get some sleep?

128
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,307
You're getting on my nerves.

129
00:07:01,518 --> 00:07:04,617
You drove your daughter
to her death.

130
00:07:05,117 --> 00:07:06,817
- How dare you cry now?
- My gosh.

131
00:07:06,817 --> 00:07:08,887
What are you doing? Leave me alone.

132
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,827
I'm a mom too,

133
00:07:10,827 --> 00:07:12,398
and I might steal,

134
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:16,197
but I'd never leech off of my kid.
Not even a beast would do that!

135
00:07:16,367 --> 00:07:18,168
- Darn you.
- You evil thing.

136
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,007
- Teach her a lesson.
- She needs one.

137
00:07:24,007 --> 00:07:25,278
- You witch.
- Oh, my gosh.

138
00:07:25,538 --> 00:07:27,577
- Stop!
- You deserve this.

139
00:07:27,577 --> 00:07:30,348
<i>Until the day the East Sea runs dry</i>

140
00:07:30,348 --> 00:07:33,648
<i>And Mount Baekdu is worn away</i>

141
00:07:33,877 --> 00:07:37,487
<i>May the deities protect our nation</i>

142
00:07:37,487 --> 00:07:40,418
<i>Hurray to Korea</i>

143
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,687
Ma'am, you sing so well.

144
00:07:43,788 --> 00:07:45,358
Is it the national anthem again?

145
00:07:45,358 --> 00:07:48,197
You might end up becoming a singer.

146
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,197
I see you have flowers in your hair.

147
00:07:51,197 --> 00:07:52,338
Aren't I pretty?

148
00:07:52,867 --> 00:07:54,567
My teacher said...

149
00:07:54,838 --> 00:07:58,778
I was a good singer
and that I was pretty.

150
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,377
Are you looking for clams?

151
00:08:01,778 --> 00:08:03,807
I hope you find lots.

152
00:08:03,978 --> 00:08:06,617
<i>Until the day the East Sea runs dry</i>

153
00:08:06,617 --> 00:08:09,648
Since when was she like that?

154
00:08:09,788 --> 00:08:12,987
After her son and his wife
died in a car accident,

155
00:08:13,317 --> 00:08:15,728
her granddaughter Ji Young
ran away from home.

156
00:08:15,987 --> 00:08:20,197
Since then, sometimes she's lucid
and sometimes she's a bit weird.

157
00:08:20,557 --> 00:08:22,798
She's perfectly fine sometimes.

158
00:08:23,528 --> 00:08:25,398
I feel so sorry for her.

159
00:08:25,398 --> 00:08:27,668
I hope her granddaughter
comes home soon.

160
00:08:27,997 --> 00:08:29,268
The poor woman.

161
00:08:32,807 --> 00:08:35,947
Ma'am. I'm heading home.

162
00:08:36,077 --> 00:08:38,247
I'm expecting a lodger.

163
00:08:38,247 --> 00:08:39,817
Okay. Go ahead.

164
00:08:40,847 --> 00:08:43,587
She must be lucid now.

165
00:08:45,418 --> 00:08:47,518
I have to go.
Good luck finding more clams.

166
00:08:47,857 --> 00:08:49,727
- How about we go too?
- Yes.

167
00:09:11,947 --> 00:09:12,977
Oh, dear.

168
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:16,288
I wonder
when Ji Young is coming back.

169
00:09:16,518 --> 00:09:18,618
Oh, dear.

170
00:09:23,288 --> 00:09:25,898
My goodness. What's that?

171
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:29,798
Is that...

172
00:09:30,628 --> 00:09:31,868
Is that Ji Young?

173
00:09:32,898 --> 00:09:34,837
Ji Young!

174
00:09:44,207 --> 00:09:46,018
- Are you her family?
- Yes.

175
00:09:46,347 --> 00:09:49,248
Doctor. How is my Ji Young?

176
00:09:49,817 --> 00:09:52,018
She can't die.

177
00:09:53,187 --> 00:09:57,057
My Ji Young's
the only family I have left.

178
00:09:57,057 --> 00:10:00,528
Will you please
save her life at least?

179
00:10:00,697 --> 00:10:02,927
We managed to save her, fortunately.

180
00:10:02,927 --> 00:10:04,227
Will My Ji Young live?

181
00:10:04,668 --> 00:10:05,998
Will she really?

182
00:10:05,998 --> 00:10:08,168
But she's in a very bad way.

183
00:10:08,437 --> 00:10:10,268
Compound fractures in all her limbs,

184
00:10:10,638 --> 00:10:13,138
multiple fractures to her face,

185
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:16,577
and she's missing lots of flesh,
so she needs emergency surgery.

186
00:10:16,947 --> 00:10:19,447
We practically have to
rebuild her whole body.

187
00:10:19,778 --> 00:10:21,648
By that, you mean...

188
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:23,988
all over her body?

189
00:10:24,288 --> 00:10:27,187
It's possible
she'll end up with a different face.

190
00:10:27,187 --> 00:10:29,528
That's how tough and serious
the surgery is.

191
00:10:30,488 --> 00:10:31,687
That's okay.

192
00:10:32,097 --> 00:10:34,398
I don't care if she has a new face.

193
00:10:34,398 --> 00:10:38,467
Just save her
so she can live a decent life.

194
00:10:38,567 --> 00:10:41,368
I have money, doctor.

195
00:10:42,668 --> 00:10:43,937
I have a diner,

196
00:10:44,107 --> 00:10:47,638
and insurance money I got
when my son died.

197
00:10:48,238 --> 00:10:49,847
She can have a new face.

198
00:10:50,008 --> 00:10:53,148
That's okay as long as you save her.

199
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:03,857
Detractor.

200
00:11:12,668 --> 00:11:13,738
Bone cutter.

201
00:11:46,597 --> 00:11:48,337
Ma'am. Ms. Gong's home.

202
00:11:49,437 --> 00:11:50,668
Good job.

203
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:56,048
Ma Ri. You stood outside
the subway station again?

204
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,207
Why would you do that?

205
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:02,087
I told you. He's my destiny.

206
00:12:02,187 --> 00:12:04,347
He's my destiny, so I must find him.

207
00:12:04,447 --> 00:12:07,158
He's bound to appear again.

208
00:12:08,388 --> 00:12:10,427
Ma Ri. If he's really your destiny,

209
00:12:10,427 --> 00:12:13,597
you'll meet again
without having to wait outside.

210
00:12:13,957 --> 00:12:16,227
Stop waiting for him there, okay?

211
00:12:17,498 --> 00:12:18,498
Are you sure?

212
00:12:18,868 --> 00:12:22,107
If we're meant to be together,
will I end up meeting him again?

213
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:23,707
What?

214
00:12:23,707 --> 00:12:25,038
Yes, of course.

215
00:12:33,548 --> 00:12:34,748
How's my Ji Young?

216
00:12:34,977 --> 00:12:36,518
The surgery went well.

217
00:12:36,648 --> 00:12:38,548
Okay. Thank you.

218
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:39,918
Thank you so much.

219
00:12:42,927 --> 00:12:45,827
Gosh, what is happening?

220
00:12:55,738 --> 00:12:56,868
Gosh, Ji Young.

221
00:12:57,967 --> 00:12:59,038
It's me, your grandma.

222
00:12:59,677 --> 00:13:01,677
You're in a hospital now.

223
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:05,477
Who are you?

224
00:13:06,778 --> 00:13:08,148
You know who I am.

225
00:13:08,717 --> 00:13:11,548
It's your grandma, Ji Young.

226
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,988
Do you not recognize your grandma?

227
00:13:14,988 --> 00:13:16,128
Do you not know me?

228
00:13:22,498 --> 00:13:23,498
My gosh.

229
00:13:24,268 --> 00:13:25,368
What do I do?

230
00:13:26,738 --> 00:13:30,837
Doctor. Ji Young is being strange.

231
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:36,577
(I don't know who the lady is.
I don't remember anything.)

232
00:13:38,148 --> 00:13:40,618
Ms. Kim Ji Young
met with a terrible accident,

233
00:13:40,847 --> 00:13:42,748
and she went through surgery
for over 20 hours.

234
00:13:43,518 --> 00:13:45,888
It looks like she's suffering
a temporary loss of memory.

235
00:13:46,557 --> 00:13:47,888
Loss of memory?

236
00:13:48,288 --> 00:13:51,227
Does that mean
she lost all her memories?

237
00:13:51,857 --> 00:13:54,557
When will she regain
her memory then?

238
00:13:54,758 --> 00:13:57,868
Her memory could return in days,
or it could take years.

239
00:13:57,868 --> 00:14:00,038
We will need to wait and see.

240
00:14:00,937 --> 00:14:01,937
Okay.

241
00:14:03,967 --> 00:14:05,008
Ji Young.

242
00:14:06,207 --> 00:14:09,707
Do you really not know who I am?

243
00:14:13,648 --> 00:14:16,087
Fine. It's okay.

244
00:14:16,988 --> 00:14:19,418
I'm just glad that you're alive.

245
00:14:20,457 --> 00:14:24,187
I'll tell you what's what.

246
00:14:25,028 --> 00:14:28,628
Then you will eventually
recover all your memories.

247
00:14:29,467 --> 00:14:30,967
Don't worry about it.

248
00:14:32,337 --> 00:14:34,498
It will be fine
as long as you're alive.

249
00:14:36,067 --> 00:14:40,077
My dear baby. Ji Young.

250
00:14:47,118 --> 00:14:50,717
(Is...)

251
00:14:50,717 --> 00:14:51,748
All right.

252
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:54,488
(Is my name...)

253
00:14:54,488 --> 00:14:56,028
Your name.

254
00:15:02,028 --> 00:15:05,437
(Is my name Ji Young?)

255
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:06,768
Yes, it is.

256
00:15:07,937 --> 00:15:10,337
Your name is Kim Ji Young.

257
00:15:10,337 --> 00:15:12,607
And you're 26.

258
00:15:13,177 --> 00:15:15,278
My granddaughter, Kim Ji Young.

259
00:15:15,548 --> 00:15:20,018
You're my one and only granddaughter,
Kim Ji Young.

260
00:15:20,618 --> 00:15:25,187
Lee Soon Jung's dear granddaughter,
Kim Ji Young.

261
00:15:42,368 --> 00:15:43,368
Pil Seung,

262
00:15:43,937 --> 00:15:46,908
I lied about having feelings for you.
It was all a lie.

263
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:51,378
I played around with you
out of boredom,

264
00:15:52,477 --> 00:15:54,118
so forget about this cruel witch.

265
00:15:55,748 --> 00:15:56,947
I wish you happiness, Pil Seung.

266
00:15:57,847 --> 00:15:58,888
Park Do Ra.

267
00:16:02,388 --> 00:16:04,028
I know this is a lie.

268
00:16:08,597 --> 00:16:10,298
Stop telling me those lies.

269
00:16:13,368 --> 00:16:15,197
Can you please come back now?

270
00:16:17,837 --> 00:16:19,908
Where in this sea
are you lying down right now?

271
00:16:22,447 --> 00:16:23,807
Can you at least tell me that?

272
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:28,317
If you do, I'll come to pick you up.

273
00:16:33,658 --> 00:16:35,388
When you came to see me,

274
00:16:37,888 --> 00:16:40,298
if I took your hands,
you wouldn't have killed yourself.

275
00:16:43,668 --> 00:16:45,868
You came to see me
looking for a way out,

276
00:16:48,337 --> 00:16:50,508
but I pushed you to the brink.

277
00:16:54,038 --> 00:16:56,548
You cared about me
until the moment you died.

278
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,018
But I...

279
00:17:01,717 --> 00:17:02,717
I...

280
00:17:05,788 --> 00:17:06,817
I'm sorry.

281
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,057
I'm so sorry.

282
00:17:12,057 --> 00:17:14,597
I'm sorry!

283
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:21,097
I'm sorry, Do Ra.

284
00:17:28,478 --> 00:17:36,345
(2 years later)

285
00:17:37,688 --> 00:17:40,458
We should buy some clams
and go home.

286
00:17:41,317 --> 00:17:44,228
We will soon have customers
at the restaurant.

287
00:17:44,228 --> 00:17:45,228
Okay.

288
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:48,258
We're selling Manila clams
at a giveaway price.

289
00:17:48,428 --> 00:17:51,468
- What?
- Please come and buy some clams.

290
00:17:51,827 --> 00:17:53,698
We're clearing out the stock.

291
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:56,637
I need some Manila clams!

292
00:17:56,768 --> 00:17:58,137
Grandma!

293
00:17:59,837 --> 00:18:01,178
All right.

294
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,377
Look at her.

295
00:18:03,377 --> 00:18:06,577
She will survive
even in the middle of a desert.

296
00:18:08,877 --> 00:18:10,548
(Soonjung Diner)

297
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:29,837
<i>Until the day the East Sea runs dry</i>

298
00:18:30,268 --> 00:18:33,208
<i>And Mount Baekdu is worn away</i>

299
00:18:33,678 --> 00:18:36,478
<i>- May the deities protect our nation</i>
- Gosh, Grandma!

300
00:18:36,778 --> 00:18:38,008
My goodness.

301
00:18:39,317 --> 00:18:40,748
It's no problem.

302
00:18:41,178 --> 00:18:42,647
This is what Grandma does sometimes.

303
00:18:42,847 --> 00:18:44,417
You know what?

304
00:18:44,887 --> 00:18:47,357
Her kalguksu is still good,
so you don't have to worry.

305
00:18:49,657 --> 00:18:51,028
<i>Let's preserve it</i>

306
00:18:52,728 --> 00:18:54,198
This is driving me crazy.

307
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:57,698
Gosh, it's hot.

308
00:18:58,627 --> 00:19:00,538
What? A week?

309
00:19:01,738 --> 00:19:04,038
Okay. Take good care of your health.

310
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:05,708
All right.

311
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:08,337
Keep up the great work,
Director Ko Pil Seung.

312
00:19:08,577 --> 00:19:09,647
Good luck!

313
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,548
My goodness. Hey.

314
00:19:13,048 --> 00:19:14,847
You should be that kind
to your husband.

315
00:19:15,278 --> 00:19:18,688
You sound so sweet
when you talk to Pil Seung.

316
00:19:18,887 --> 00:19:20,057
Gosh, Mother.

317
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,357
Pil Seung isn't coming home tonight?

318
00:19:22,587 --> 00:19:25,288
No. He's going out of town
for a shoot.

319
00:19:25,528 --> 00:19:27,198
- He'll be away for a week.
- What?

320
00:19:27,198 --> 00:19:30,498
It's been only a few years
since he got a job at the TV station.

321
00:19:30,827 --> 00:19:33,238
How did he get to work
on such a big project...

322
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:35,238
for a TV series?

323
00:19:35,438 --> 00:19:37,607
The one-part series he made...

324
00:19:37,738 --> 00:19:39,307
won an award
at an international festival.

325
00:19:39,307 --> 00:19:40,938
That's how he got to be
a director of this miniseries.

326
00:19:41,077 --> 00:19:43,248
Mom, that's not something
anyone can do.

327
00:19:43,278 --> 00:19:44,907
- Really?
- Yes.

328
00:19:45,008 --> 00:19:47,077
After Do Ra died,

329
00:19:47,077 --> 00:19:49,147
Pil Seung buried himself
in his work like crazy.

330
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,617
And he's finally made
something of himself.

331
00:19:51,617 --> 00:19:52,617
I know.

332
00:19:54,587 --> 00:19:55,988
But what's the point
of being successful?

333
00:19:56,327 --> 00:19:58,827
I asked him to check my script,
but he couldn't care less about it.

334
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,057
He's so annoying.

335
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:03,528
Sun Young.

336
00:20:03,798 --> 00:20:06,538
Can't you put in a good word
for me with him?

337
00:20:07,167 --> 00:20:09,567
I did ask him
to take good care of you,

338
00:20:09,907 --> 00:20:11,768
but he wouldn't even
let me talk about it...

339
00:20:11,768 --> 00:20:13,137
saying he didn't want to use
his personal connections.

340
00:20:13,678 --> 00:20:15,077
Gosh, Sun Young.

341
00:20:15,607 --> 00:20:17,978
Still, you should talk to Pil Seung.

342
00:20:20,077 --> 00:20:21,117
Okay.

343
00:20:23,548 --> 00:20:25,417
You know how they say
time heals all wounds.

344
00:20:25,718 --> 00:20:27,117
I guess that's true.

345
00:20:27,718 --> 00:20:30,357
Pil Seung finally pulled himself together
to focus on work.

346
00:20:30,857 --> 00:20:31,928
Don't you think so?

347
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:33,758
Hey.

348
00:20:34,557 --> 00:20:35,798
Who on earth are you?

349
00:20:37,428 --> 00:20:38,597
What's your deal?

350
00:20:40,597 --> 00:20:42,198
I feel like
everything you've said...

351
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:44,167
is a lie.

352
00:20:46,137 --> 00:20:47,778
What more do you want to know
about me?

353
00:20:48,978 --> 00:20:51,248
Why can't you take me for who I am?

354
00:20:52,748 --> 00:20:53,748
Fine.

355
00:20:54,218 --> 00:20:55,347
It leaves me with no other choice.

356
00:20:56,448 --> 00:20:57,748
Let's end things here.

357
00:20:59,288 --> 00:21:00,317
Cut.

358
00:21:07,597 --> 00:21:10,268
You know the genre of our drama
is mystery and romance.

359
00:21:11,167 --> 00:21:13,968
A rich man from Seoul is falling
in love with a country girl.

360
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:16,238
But she doesn't look
like a country girl,

361
00:21:16,407 --> 00:21:18,867
so you find it strange
and search for the truth.

362
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:22,337
But you sound emotionally barren.

363
00:21:22,978 --> 00:21:24,248
Let's concentrate on the emotion
and try again.

364
00:21:24,478 --> 00:21:25,478
Director Ko.

365
00:21:25,948 --> 00:21:27,278
This is our fifth attempt.

366
00:21:27,278 --> 00:21:29,018
How much more can we concentrate?

367
00:21:30,147 --> 00:21:32,917
Director Ko, it's not like
you're going to Cannes with this.

368
00:21:34,258 --> 00:21:35,417
All right. Let's do it again.

369
00:21:37,788 --> 00:21:39,758
I wonder what made
Ko Pil Seung change like that.

370
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,627
If I knew he'd be so stubborn,
I wouldn't have done this.

371
00:21:43,597 --> 00:21:45,327
Now he's all condescending.
And he's ridiculously tall.

372
00:21:45,768 --> 00:21:48,038
Jae Dong, get me some water.

373
00:21:51,238 --> 00:21:52,307
Here.

374
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:54,778
You're doing a great job.

375
00:21:55,407 --> 00:21:56,607
- Did it look good?
- Yes, it's great.

376
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,107
- Wipe your lips.
- Okay.

377
00:21:59,107 --> 00:22:00,178
Focus.

378
00:22:00,748 --> 00:22:02,948
All right. One, two.

379
00:22:03,048 --> 00:22:04,147
Ready, action.

380
00:22:11,258 --> 00:22:12,827
- What are you all doing here?
- My goodness.

381
00:22:12,827 --> 00:22:15,258
- Cut. No good.
- You startled me.

382
00:22:15,258 --> 00:22:17,827
Ma'am, we're in the middle
of filming.

383
00:22:17,827 --> 00:22:19,637
That's right. I'm Cha Bong Soo.

384
00:22:19,837 --> 00:22:21,367
Do a better job securing the scene!

385
00:22:22,097 --> 00:22:23,907
Gi Sub! Darn it.

386
00:22:24,107 --> 00:22:27,178
Yes, you're absolutely right.
I'm Cha Bong Soo.

387
00:22:27,238 --> 00:22:28,907
I'm so sorry about this.

388
00:22:29,377 --> 00:22:31,377
Grandma, you can't do this here.

389
00:22:31,377 --> 00:22:32,518
We should get going.

390
00:22:32,647 --> 00:22:34,317
What's the matter with you?

391
00:22:34,347 --> 00:22:35,347
I'm terribly sorry.

392
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:43,249
My gosh.

393
00:22:43,274 --> 00:22:44,375
I'm sorry.

394
00:22:44,675 --> 00:22:46,014
Let's get going.

395
00:22:46,014 --> 00:22:48,185
- Grandma, come on.
- What has gotten into you?

396
00:22:55,224 --> 00:22:56,685
All right, let's resume.

397
00:22:58,425 --> 00:23:00,325
Gosh, I can't believe it.

398
00:23:00,554 --> 00:23:02,895
Bi Bi's an absolute doll,

399
00:23:03,024 --> 00:23:04,895
and Cha Bong Soo's so good-looking.

400
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:06,794
(Filming in progress: "Don't Lie")

401
00:23:06,794 --> 00:23:09,665
In person,
he's not a sleazeball at all.

402
00:23:09,665 --> 00:23:11,534
He's totally my type.

403
00:23:11,534 --> 00:23:13,734
Hold on. Ji Young, wait.

404
00:23:14,304 --> 00:23:16,274
How am I here?

405
00:23:16,274 --> 00:23:18,145
Grandma, have you finally
come back to me?

406
00:23:19,244 --> 00:23:22,345
You're killing me, Grandma.

407
00:23:22,514 --> 00:23:24,855
You caused a mess over there.

408
00:23:25,784 --> 00:23:27,655
You keep telling me
to get my act together,

409
00:23:27,655 --> 00:23:29,625
but take your own advice.

410
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:31,524
Was I out of my mind again?

411
00:23:31,655 --> 00:23:33,895
I don't know
why I keep getting like this.

412
00:23:34,095 --> 00:23:35,595
Goodness me. Come on.

413
00:23:35,794 --> 00:23:37,294
Let's head home.

414
00:23:37,294 --> 00:23:39,464
- Sure thing.
- Come on.

415
00:23:42,204 --> 00:23:46,034
What has gotten into you?
I said we should head home.

416
00:23:46,405 --> 00:23:49,345
Customers will be waiting for us
at the diner.

417
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:51,774
You shouldn't have
left it unattended.

418
00:23:52,044 --> 00:23:55,014
How many times must I repeat myself?

419
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:57,214
Even if I lose my mind and run off,

420
00:23:57,214 --> 00:23:59,155
you shouldn't look for me...

421
00:23:59,385 --> 00:24:03,484
and keep working at the diner
without going anywhere.

422
00:24:03,825 --> 00:24:06,895
It's not like I'd ever leave town.

423
00:24:07,224 --> 00:24:10,224
Our neighbors
will get me back home...

424
00:24:10,494 --> 00:24:12,764
one way or another.

425
00:24:12,835 --> 00:24:15,034
- Let's go.
- Sure. I'm coming.

426
00:24:15,034 --> 00:24:17,135
- Let's get going.
- I hear you.

427
00:24:17,135 --> 00:24:18,974
Okay, I'm coming.

428
00:24:18,974 --> 00:24:20,605
You're killing me.

429
00:24:32,385 --> 00:24:34,284
My gosh. What am I doing?

430
00:24:34,925 --> 00:24:35,954
Darn.

431
00:24:36,585 --> 00:24:38,925
What is it? Has it gone bad?

432
00:24:40,095 --> 00:24:41,165
Grandma.

433
00:24:42,464 --> 00:24:44,034
My heart feels funny.

434
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:47,804
It's pounding for some reason.

435
00:24:48,234 --> 00:24:49,304
What?

436
00:24:50,534 --> 00:24:51,835
Your heart is pounding?

437
00:24:52,234 --> 00:24:56,575
Could it be a side-effect
of your surgery?

438
00:24:56,575 --> 00:24:58,514
Let me see.
Do you also have a fever?

439
00:24:58,575 --> 00:25:00,175
No, it's not like that.

440
00:25:01,685 --> 00:25:05,385
I can't stop thinking
about the filming set from earlier.

441
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:08,425
It keeps distracting me in a way...

442
00:25:09,054 --> 00:25:10,224
that I can't think straight.

443
00:25:11,454 --> 00:25:13,024
I can't seem to focus
on my work either.

444
00:25:13,395 --> 00:25:15,224
What the...

445
00:25:15,565 --> 00:25:18,835
What kind of nonsense
are you spewing?

446
00:25:19,165 --> 00:25:23,865
As if you have anything to do
with that filming crew or set.

447
00:25:23,935 --> 00:25:25,234
Who knows?

448
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:28,175
But what can I do
when my heart won't stop pounding?

449
00:25:30,915 --> 00:25:33,575
Grandma, can't we close up...

450
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:36,284
and go watch
the TV show being filmed?

451
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:38,885
What on earth are you talking about?

452
00:25:39,054 --> 00:25:41,454
We have onions and garlic to peel...

453
00:25:41,454 --> 00:25:43,954
and kimchi to make.

454
00:25:43,954 --> 00:25:45,625
There's so much work
that needs to be done.

455
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:49,325
I'll do all of that
after I get back.

456
00:25:50,294 --> 00:25:51,835
It's not every day...

457
00:25:51,835 --> 00:25:54,504
a filming crew comes to work
in a small town like this.

458
00:25:54,935 --> 00:25:56,464
Gosh. So that's why...

459
00:25:57,435 --> 00:25:58,774
- What the...
- I'm heading over there.

460
00:25:58,774 --> 00:26:01,204
Hey. What on earth...

461
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:02,774
Unbelievable.

462
00:26:03,304 --> 00:26:06,315
What has gotten into her today?

463
00:26:06,675 --> 00:26:08,484
Keep watching her
and be lost in thought.

464
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:10,014
(Filming in progress: "Don't Lie")

465
00:26:10,014 --> 00:26:11,655
- Call her name and...
- After that...

466
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:13,714
- Is that far enough?
- No, make more room.

467
00:26:13,714 --> 00:26:14,724
Okay.

468
00:26:15,054 --> 00:26:16,784
Cha Bong Soo, my gosh.

469
00:26:18,024 --> 00:26:19,224
He's so hot.

470
00:26:20,425 --> 00:26:21,724
Is he a real-life person?

471
00:26:22,095 --> 00:26:23,964
Assistant Director,
where's the puppy?

472
00:26:25,395 --> 00:26:27,165
Director Ko, you see...

473
00:26:27,804 --> 00:26:29,464
What is it? Is it not here?

474
00:26:30,335 --> 00:26:32,135
I just got the call,

475
00:26:32,204 --> 00:26:34,204
but they got into a car accident
on their way here.

476
00:26:34,405 --> 00:26:35,405
What?

477
00:26:36,617 --> 00:26:37,917
So when will they be here?

478
00:26:38,016 --> 00:26:39,217
In about two hours.

479
00:26:40,457 --> 00:26:41,586
Two hours?

480
00:26:44,697 --> 00:26:46,026
I'm sorry, sir.

481
00:26:46,526 --> 00:26:48,697
I should've told them
to hit the road sooner.

482
00:26:48,697 --> 00:26:49,766
Darn it.

483
00:26:51,566 --> 00:26:53,036
Are you looking for a puppy?

484
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:55,036
What kind of puppy?

485
00:26:55,266 --> 00:26:57,207
A black one, a yellow one,
or a white one?

486
00:26:57,776 --> 00:26:59,907
I know a lot of puppies, you see.

487
00:27:01,647 --> 00:27:04,046
Be careful with my babies!

488
00:27:04,076 --> 00:27:06,917
Got it. Don't you worry.

489
00:27:12,357 --> 00:27:14,357
Here. Take your pick.

490
00:27:16,526 --> 00:27:19,427
Gosh, thank you. Thank you so much.

491
00:27:19,657 --> 00:27:20,796
Goodness.

492
00:27:21,867 --> 00:27:25,036
Tell me if there's
anything else you need.

493
00:27:25,137 --> 00:27:27,536
I have everything
except for those I don't have.

494
00:27:28,266 --> 00:27:31,407
I'm known as Handywoman Kim
in this neighborhood.

495
00:27:31,907 --> 00:27:33,836
- Thank you.
- Gosh.

496
00:27:34,947 --> 00:27:35,977
Look at you.

497
00:27:35,977 --> 00:27:38,417
What is this so-called sincerity
you keep talking about?

498
00:27:40,846 --> 00:27:43,016
Cut. That was great. Good job, guys.

499
00:27:43,246 --> 00:27:44,816
Okay, good job.

500
00:27:44,816 --> 00:27:46,756
Gosh, the hair.

501
00:27:47,586 --> 00:27:49,586
- Here's the puppy.
- Right.

502
00:27:50,457 --> 00:27:52,197
By the way, what's your name?

503
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:53,756
Me?

504
00:27:53,826 --> 00:27:55,697
I'm Kim Ji Young.

505
00:27:56,367 --> 00:27:58,766
Ji Young, thank you
for getting us the white dog.

506
00:27:59,066 --> 00:28:01,437
You saved me today.

507
00:28:01,506 --> 00:28:02,867
Goodness.

508
00:28:03,667 --> 00:28:05,637
Don't be ridiculous.

509
00:28:05,776 --> 00:28:08,346
I only walked from here and there...

510
00:28:08,346 --> 00:28:11,046
with puppies
that had nothing better to do.

511
00:28:11,546 --> 00:28:13,516
You're being ridiculous.

512
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:17,657
How did you find out
about this restaurant?

513
00:28:18,657 --> 00:28:20,617
My karaoke friend Byul told me...

514
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:22,127
that the pasta here is to die for.

515
00:28:22,727 --> 00:28:23,727
Really?

516
00:28:24,897 --> 00:28:26,096
Here's your meal.

517
00:28:28,096 --> 00:28:29,096
What?

518
00:28:30,697 --> 00:28:31,697
Do Jun?

519
00:28:32,937 --> 00:28:33,967
Ma Ri?

520
00:28:35,967 --> 00:28:37,467
Gosh, Do Jun.

521
00:28:38,806 --> 00:28:40,677
- Hello.
- Hi.

522
00:28:42,276 --> 00:28:43,276
Gosh.

523
00:28:44,006 --> 00:28:45,546
Driver Kang's resigning?

524
00:28:46,546 --> 00:28:47,546
Yes.

525
00:28:48,016 --> 00:28:49,147
But that's out of the blue.

526
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:51,387
I think he has a family issue.

527
00:28:51,617 --> 00:28:54,086
He's moving to Jeju
where his son is.

528
00:28:55,427 --> 00:28:58,256
It's hard to find someone
we can trust Ma Ri with,

529
00:28:58,256 --> 00:28:59,457
so what now?

530
00:29:00,596 --> 00:29:02,026
We'll have to look for someone.

531
00:29:02,026 --> 00:29:04,227
You should also look for someone
we can trust.

532
00:29:05,236 --> 00:29:06,336
Sure.

533
00:29:07,566 --> 00:29:08,667
By the way,

534
00:29:08,967 --> 00:29:12,437
do you remember Do Jun,
the student who once helped Ma Ri?

535
00:29:14,276 --> 00:29:16,076
The student who studied abroad?

536
00:29:17,246 --> 00:29:19,746
Of course.
How could I ever forget him?

537
00:29:20,417 --> 00:29:22,947
But why would you bring him up?

538
00:29:23,417 --> 00:29:26,316
Ma Ri and I
went to eat at a restaurant,

539
00:29:26,316 --> 00:29:28,857
and he showed up as our server.

540
00:29:30,526 --> 00:29:32,526
Didn't he say
he was studying in the US?

541
00:29:33,457 --> 00:29:35,796
His family's financial situation
took a bad turn,

542
00:29:35,796 --> 00:29:37,096
so he moved back to Korea.

543
00:29:37,867 --> 00:29:40,266
Even though it's been a while,

544
00:29:40,266 --> 00:29:43,566
he was still just as decent
and mature for his age.

545
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:47,707
Honey, I'd love to ask him
if he'd like the job.

546
00:29:48,276 --> 00:29:49,506
What do you say?

547
00:29:51,276 --> 00:29:52,576
Him?

548
00:29:56,217 --> 00:29:58,357
Such a handsome man...

549
00:29:58,586 --> 00:30:00,917
has such a cool autograph.

550
00:30:03,887 --> 00:30:07,427
Grandma, watching
the crew film the series...

551
00:30:07,727 --> 00:30:09,566
was so much fun.

552
00:30:09,627 --> 00:30:11,496
My heart kept on pounding.

553
00:30:12,637 --> 00:30:14,707
I'd love to have a job
as cool as that.

554
00:30:15,137 --> 00:30:17,107
How can one get a job that cool?

555
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:19,637
This is exactly why
you should've listened to me...

556
00:30:19,637 --> 00:30:21,647
and studied hard when I told you to.

557
00:30:22,806 --> 00:30:26,576
Instead, you were busy
chasing after boys.

558
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:28,117
I didn't study in school...

559
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:30,687
and spent my time chasing boys?

560
00:30:30,687 --> 00:30:31,717
That's right.

561
00:30:32,117 --> 00:30:35,187
Why didn't you set me straight?

562
00:30:35,657 --> 00:30:38,127
You should've hit me
if you had to...

563
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:40,227
and get me to study
instead of chasing boys.

564
00:30:40,227 --> 00:30:43,326
What? It's true how they say
that those farts make louder noises.

565
00:30:43,326 --> 00:30:45,937
Is this you resenting me?

566
00:30:46,236 --> 00:30:48,137
No, it's not like that.

567
00:30:49,066 --> 00:30:51,776
If I had known,
I would've studied harder.

568
00:30:52,677 --> 00:30:55,576
I'm angry with myself, that's all.

569
00:30:56,677 --> 00:30:59,877
I'm here making dough
in a small countryside town...

570
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:02,016
while someone does
something so cool.

571
00:31:03,046 --> 00:31:05,887
How can life be this unfair?

572
00:31:08,857 --> 00:31:09,887
What...

573
00:31:11,397 --> 00:31:12,397
Goodness.

574
00:31:14,667 --> 00:31:15,667
Sure.

575
00:31:16,596 --> 00:31:17,627
Excuse me.

576
00:31:18,336 --> 00:31:19,667
Miss.

577
00:31:20,667 --> 00:31:22,836
- I see you're working late.
- Right.

578
00:31:23,536 --> 00:31:25,937
Ma'am, what brings you by
at this hour?

579
00:31:26,836 --> 00:31:28,306
Well...

580
00:31:29,006 --> 00:31:30,246
You see,

581
00:31:30,677 --> 00:31:34,846
I have a granddaughter
by the name of Kim Ji Young,

582
00:31:35,786 --> 00:31:38,256
and she wants to work
on set with you...

583
00:31:38,256 --> 00:31:40,756
doing what you people do.

584
00:31:41,187 --> 00:31:42,187
Sorry?

585
00:31:42,586 --> 00:31:46,457
So I came by to ask for a favor.

586
00:31:46,897 --> 00:31:50,467
Couldn't you give her a job?

587
00:31:51,637 --> 00:31:53,867
If you don't have
a proper job for her,

588
00:31:54,437 --> 00:31:57,236
let her at least clean up for you.

589
00:31:57,506 --> 00:31:59,776
She can also run errands.

590
00:31:59,937 --> 00:32:02,947
Ji Young's a smart one
who gets along with people,

591
00:32:03,377 --> 00:32:05,677
so she'll be good
at whatever task you give her.

592
00:32:06,746 --> 00:32:07,776
Ma'am,

593
00:32:07,776 --> 00:32:10,387
I know who you're talking about.

594
00:32:10,647 --> 00:32:12,486
She helped me immensely
earlier today...

595
00:32:12,486 --> 00:32:14,286
by getting me some puppies.

596
00:32:14,526 --> 00:32:17,086
Gosh, is that so?

597
00:32:17,086 --> 00:32:18,096
Right.

598
00:32:18,357 --> 00:32:21,127
But we don't have a job opening,

599
00:32:21,566 --> 00:32:22,627
so I'm sorry.

600
00:32:24,536 --> 00:32:28,806
Gosh, don't apologize. I understand.

601
00:32:29,236 --> 00:32:32,377
Of course, all spots are taken
when a job is this cool.

602
00:32:33,177 --> 00:32:36,076
I only came by to ask just in case.

603
00:32:36,806 --> 00:32:38,846
All right, then.

604
00:32:40,217 --> 00:32:41,447
- I'm sorry I bothered you.
- Gosh.

605
00:32:41,447 --> 00:32:42,447
Then...

606
00:32:43,217 --> 00:32:45,286
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

607
00:32:49,387 --> 00:32:50,687
Being by the sea...

608
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:54,056
reminds me of Do Ra.

609
00:32:56,296 --> 00:32:59,236
It's already been two years
since she left this world.

610
00:33:03,407 --> 00:33:04,437
Director Ko,

611
00:33:05,306 --> 00:33:07,036
when we filmed
"Straightforward Romance,"

612
00:33:07,306 --> 00:33:09,806
we went through a lot,
filming at locations...

613
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:13,117
such as the beach and woods.

614
00:33:16,447 --> 00:33:19,586
If I had known she'd be gone,
I would've been nicer to her.

615
00:33:23,157 --> 00:33:24,157
Bong Soo, come on.

616
00:33:24,697 --> 00:33:26,296
Why would you talk about the dead?

617
00:33:27,526 --> 00:33:30,397
It must be because we're by the sea,
but the beer is refreshing.

618
00:33:31,127 --> 00:33:32,367
The air is also fresh.

619
00:33:32,697 --> 00:33:33,697
You know,

620
00:33:34,536 --> 00:33:37,607
the fact that she's gone
still hasn't sunken in.

621
00:33:38,607 --> 00:33:40,236
I feel like she's alive somewhere.

622
00:33:47,016 --> 00:33:48,086
Pil Seung.

623
00:33:49,647 --> 00:33:50,647
You don't know...

624
00:33:51,786 --> 00:33:55,357
how it is to live as a celebrity
whose face is known to many people.

625
00:33:57,427 --> 00:33:59,026
If you do something wrong,

626
00:34:00,127 --> 00:34:03,096
the public comes after you
like you're a flea they must burn.

627
00:34:04,427 --> 00:34:06,036
When they find your weakness,

628
00:34:06,467 --> 00:34:08,407
they come at it like hyenas.

629
00:34:09,066 --> 00:34:10,707
It's like
they want to see you suffer.

630
00:34:12,806 --> 00:34:13,977
It was the same with Do Ra.

631
00:34:15,677 --> 00:34:18,176
Remember how the world
talked smack about her?

632
00:34:20,216 --> 00:34:24,116
Do Ra was killed by the whole world.

633
00:34:25,857 --> 00:34:29,457
People in this world
drove her over the edge.

634
00:34:32,897 --> 00:34:33,926
Gosh.

635
00:34:35,366 --> 00:34:37,426
Whenever I think about Do Ra...

636
00:34:38,636 --> 00:34:40,136
Can you imagine...

637
00:34:40,136 --> 00:34:41,607
how lonely she must've been
in her last moments?

638
00:34:42,966 --> 00:34:44,207
For some reason today,

639
00:34:45,107 --> 00:34:47,477
I miss her like crazy.

640
00:34:47,477 --> 00:34:48,977
Do Ra!

641
00:34:52,176 --> 00:34:55,846
If you miss her so much,
meet her in death, why don't you?

642
00:34:56,187 --> 00:34:57,216
Darn it.

643
00:34:57,987 --> 00:34:59,757
- Gosh.
- Bi Bi, wait.

644
00:34:59,757 --> 00:35:01,386
Bi Bi!

645
00:35:15,007 --> 00:35:17,437
Where have you been?

646
00:35:18,536 --> 00:35:21,076
Where on earth did you go?

647
00:35:21,877 --> 00:35:24,716
I went to relieve myself.

648
00:35:25,676 --> 00:35:28,446
I thought you left me alone...

649
00:35:28,446 --> 00:35:31,817
in the haunted house
and went somewhere else.

650
00:35:33,556 --> 00:35:37,142
Don't go anywhere without me
from now on.

651
00:35:43,167 --> 00:35:44,167
Do Ra...

652
00:35:46,167 --> 00:35:47,866
She was so afraid of the dark.

653
00:35:54,007 --> 00:35:55,007
Do Ra.

654
00:35:57,406 --> 00:35:58,446
Are you all right?

655
00:36:01,277 --> 00:36:02,487
Are you doing well?

656
00:36:11,696 --> 00:36:12,757
What are you doing up there?

657
00:36:19,167 --> 00:36:21,806
Gosh, aren't you
that TV show director?

658
00:36:22,906 --> 00:36:26,277
Director, my gosh.
You can't be here.

659
00:36:26,636 --> 00:36:29,147
Didn't you hear
about the infamous sea ghost?

660
00:36:30,607 --> 00:36:31,616
Then...

661
00:36:32,016 --> 00:36:35,616
what are you doing at a place
that is haunted by a sea ghost?

662
00:36:36,547 --> 00:36:38,757
What else?
I was fishing for octopus.

663
00:36:39,317 --> 00:36:40,616
We have meals to cook tomorrow.

664
00:36:43,786 --> 00:36:46,496
As if there's any need
to be so jumpy.

665
00:36:47,027 --> 00:36:48,426
Haven't you seen octopuses before?

666
00:36:50,297 --> 00:36:51,797
Anyway, you should get going.

667
00:36:52,636 --> 00:36:54,567
The sea ghost here is a virgin,

668
00:36:54,766 --> 00:36:57,067
and she'll drag any man
into the sea.

669
00:36:59,076 --> 00:37:02,207
As if such a thing exists
in modern times.

670
00:37:04,547 --> 00:37:05,576
Is that so?

671
00:37:07,417 --> 00:37:09,817
Then stay here all you want...

672
00:37:10,246 --> 00:37:12,187
and do clapping games with her.

673
00:37:13,417 --> 00:37:14,516
It sounds like fun.

674
00:37:17,056 --> 00:37:18,996
Wait.

675
00:37:20,326 --> 00:37:21,426
Hold on.

676
00:37:22,596 --> 00:37:23,727
You sure move fast.

677
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:10,507
Gosh, Jin Dan. What's wrong?

678
00:38:13,047 --> 00:38:14,147
Was it another nightmare?

679
00:38:14,676 --> 00:38:17,386
Goodness me.
You're drenched in sweat.

680
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:23,326
Why have you been like this
ever since Park Do Ra's death?

681
00:38:24,286 --> 00:38:25,457
Was it the same nightmare?

682
00:38:25,457 --> 00:38:26,727
Did she show up again?

683
00:38:27,797 --> 00:38:28,797
Yes.

684
00:38:28,797 --> 00:38:30,766
Why does she continue
to haunt you...

685
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,196
when you're not the one
who killed her?

686
00:38:33,496 --> 00:38:37,937
It seems as though
her spirit is haunting you.

687
00:38:38,406 --> 00:38:39,906
Mom, what are you talking about?

688
00:38:40,377 --> 00:38:42,277
Why else would you be
having these nightmares?

689
00:38:43,346 --> 00:38:44,346
Hold on.

690
00:38:44,607 --> 00:38:46,777
Maybe we should get rid of her
via exorcism.

691
00:38:49,487 --> 00:38:50,516
An exorcism?

692
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:53,962
(Shaman)

693
00:38:55,621 --> 00:38:57,531
Come to me.

694
00:39:03,287 --> 00:39:04,517
Get away from him!

695
00:39:05,157 --> 00:39:06,856
How dare you cling to him?

696
00:39:06,956 --> 00:39:09,586
Even if you were bitter,
you should be long gone by now.

697
00:39:09,856 --> 00:39:11,597
What more do you want
from this life?

698
00:39:16,597 --> 00:39:18,666
She feels too wronged to leave.

699
00:39:20,267 --> 00:39:22,566
Why are you this bitter?

700
00:39:32,077 --> 00:39:33,887
Yes, I know it all too well.

701
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:36,217
I know you've been miserable.

702
00:39:36,717 --> 00:39:38,887
Why else would you have
given up on life?

703
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:42,186
Still, no matter
how wronged you feel,

704
00:39:42,787 --> 00:39:44,927
there is no room for you
in the world of the living.

705
00:39:45,456 --> 00:39:49,697
So detach yourself from him
and find peace.

706
00:39:50,066 --> 00:39:53,666
I will allow you
to unleash your sorrow today.

707
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:57,376
Come to me.

708
00:39:59,077 --> 00:40:00,407
Yes!

709
00:40:00,807 --> 00:40:01,876
That's right.

710
00:40:09,816 --> 00:40:11,086
I'm Do Ra.

711
00:40:12,586 --> 00:40:13,827
Park Do Ra.

712
00:40:16,227 --> 00:40:18,657
Put your hand on your heart...

713
00:40:20,244 --> 00:40:21,675
and ask yourself...

714
00:40:24,545 --> 00:40:27,884
why I'm wandering around here
to haunt you.

715
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:38,665
You left, saying you didn't like me.

716
00:40:39,724 --> 00:40:41,565
Why are you doing this
when you rejected me?

717
00:40:42,235 --> 00:40:43,864
Why are you tormenting me?

718
00:40:44,904 --> 00:40:46,335
Did I tell you to die?

719
00:40:46,875 --> 00:40:48,134
I told you to marry me.

720
00:40:50,005 --> 00:40:51,045
Do you know...

721
00:40:51,744 --> 00:40:54,514
how much my heart ached
because of you?

722
00:40:55,574 --> 00:40:57,815
It would've been fine
if you'd come to me.

723
00:40:58,215 --> 00:40:59,744
Then I'd have taken you back.

724
00:41:00,684 --> 00:41:02,355
Did you dislike me to death?

725
00:41:02,784 --> 00:41:05,724
Tell me.
Did you dislike me that much?

726
00:41:08,724 --> 00:41:09,755
Do Ra.

727
00:41:11,494 --> 00:41:12,525
I'm sorry.

728
00:41:13,665 --> 00:41:15,494
I'm really sorry.

729
00:41:15,494 --> 00:41:17,434
I didn't think you'd die.

730
00:41:17,434 --> 00:41:20,404
I wouldn't have done that
if I'd thought you'd die.

731
00:41:20,404 --> 00:41:22,675
I thought you'd choose me.

732
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:26,715
How could you not see
how I felt about you?

733
00:41:27,074 --> 00:41:29,145
I actually loved you,

734
00:41:29,145 --> 00:41:31,784
so how could you crush my heart?

735
00:41:31,784 --> 00:41:33,585
How could you?

736
00:41:42,824 --> 00:41:45,125
I'm sorry, Do Ra.

737
00:41:46,264 --> 00:41:48,295
(Shaman)

738
00:41:49,065 --> 00:41:52,735
I was too embarrassed
to stay seated.

739
00:41:54,034 --> 00:41:55,804
Why did you cry so much...

740
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:57,605
about a girl who rejected you?

741
00:41:58,145 --> 00:42:00,574
She's haunting you
because you're not over her.

742
00:42:01,244 --> 00:42:02,715
Why care about a dead girl?

743
00:42:03,045 --> 00:42:04,844
When will you get over it?

744
00:42:06,514 --> 00:42:08,585
What were you talking about
in there?

745
00:42:09,085 --> 00:42:11,154
What wouldn't you have done
if you'd known she'd die?

746
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:13,925
Did something happen
between you two before she died?

747
00:42:14,255 --> 00:42:16,125
Did you cause her death
or something?

748
00:42:16,395 --> 00:42:17,764
What would I have done?

749
00:42:18,565 --> 00:42:20,165
I don't remember what I said.

750
00:42:21,994 --> 00:42:23,534
What's happening?

751
00:42:24,165 --> 00:42:26,134
I don't think he's haunted
by Do Ra's ghost.

752
00:42:26,974 --> 00:42:28,534
I think he has gone crazy.

753
00:42:29,404 --> 00:42:32,505
I'm so darn upset.

754
00:42:33,675 --> 00:42:34,974
Gil Dong left?

755
00:42:35,545 --> 00:42:36,645
What do you mean?

756
00:42:36,645 --> 00:42:38,844
His girlfriend
was in a car accident,

757
00:42:38,844 --> 00:42:41,114
and he went to Seoul
saying he needed to look after her.

758
00:42:41,514 --> 00:42:44,425
He said he felt too guilty
to tell you to your face.

759
00:42:45,755 --> 00:42:48,425
He's a lunatic.
He thinks he's so romantic.

760
00:42:48,925 --> 00:42:50,665
He said love came before work.

761
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:54,864
We have a lot to do
and we really need extra help.

762
00:42:54,864 --> 00:42:55,864
What now?

763
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:02,775
What did you just say?

764
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:07,114
You want me
to help you film a drama?

765
00:43:07,415 --> 00:43:10,145
Yes. Your grandmother said
you wanted to...

766
00:43:10,145 --> 00:43:11,545
do that kind of work.

767
00:43:12,045 --> 00:43:14,485
That's what you said.

768
00:43:14,915 --> 00:43:19,384
You said you wanted so much
to do the job they were doing.

769
00:43:19,994 --> 00:43:21,994
Yes, I did say that.

770
00:43:22,494 --> 00:43:23,895
I'd love to work with you.

771
00:43:24,065 --> 00:43:25,965
Will you join us today, then?

772
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:27,195
Today?

773
00:43:27,634 --> 00:43:30,434
My gosh. Are you serious?

774
00:43:30,864 --> 00:43:32,835
Are you sure?

775
00:43:32,835 --> 00:43:35,605
Yes. We have an unexpected opening.

776
00:43:35,934 --> 00:43:37,574
But...

777
00:43:37,904 --> 00:43:41,945
do you think I can do
something so grand?

778
00:43:42,545 --> 00:43:44,744
I haven't learned
anything about the work.

779
00:43:44,744 --> 00:43:46,684
It shouldn't be that hard.

780
00:43:46,755 --> 00:43:49,954
The youngest assistants
run errands and do physical labor.

781
00:43:50,654 --> 00:43:53,525
You have to carry
and move heavy props,

782
00:43:53,525 --> 00:43:56,224
and it's quite physical,
so it will be exhausting.

783
00:43:56,554 --> 00:43:57,864
Are you okay with that?

784
00:43:58,065 --> 00:43:59,724
It requires energy, you mean?

785
00:43:59,965 --> 00:44:03,404
I'm just fine with that.

786
00:44:03,835 --> 00:44:05,505
This is great.

787
00:44:05,835 --> 00:44:07,735
If there's one thing I'm sure about,

788
00:44:07,735 --> 00:44:10,804
I'm the strongest person
in the village.

789
00:44:10,804 --> 00:44:13,545
- Aren't I, Grandma?
- That you are.

790
00:44:13,945 --> 00:44:15,175
She is.

791
00:44:15,175 --> 00:44:19,844
My Ji Young is strong.
I guarantee you that.

792
00:44:31,525 --> 00:44:32,565
Cut. Okay!

793
00:44:33,224 --> 00:44:34,235
Nice one!

794
00:44:34,795 --> 00:44:36,965
Let's move to the next spot!

795
00:44:39,701 --> 00:44:41,137
(Filming in progress: "Don't Lie")

796
00:44:43,175 --> 00:44:45,175
Oh, no. The ice melted.

797
00:44:54,384 --> 00:44:55,884
The camera will spin like this.

798
00:44:57,954 --> 00:44:59,025
Shake him off.

799
00:45:09,764 --> 00:45:10,864
There.

800
00:45:22,244 --> 00:45:23,244
Cut. Okay!

801
00:45:25,485 --> 00:45:28,085
Director.
Drink this while it's cold.

802
00:45:28,315 --> 00:45:29,585
Thanks.

803
00:45:31,925 --> 00:45:33,695
Assistant Director, you too.

804
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:37,895
- Drink this.
- Thanks.

805
00:45:42,165 --> 00:45:43,395
Here.

806
00:45:43,864 --> 00:45:46,775
- Have a nice, cold drink.
- Thanks.

807
00:45:47,005 --> 00:45:48,134
- Here.
- Lovely.

808
00:45:48,275 --> 00:45:50,675
- Here you go.
- Great, thanks.

809
00:45:50,675 --> 00:45:53,045
She's good at this.
She's hard-working too.

810
00:45:53,574 --> 00:45:55,145
Her name is Kim Ji Young.

811
00:45:55,775 --> 00:45:57,945
Right, Kim Ji Young.

812
00:45:58,645 --> 00:46:00,154
Can I have another one?

813
00:46:00,154 --> 00:46:01,815
You want another one?

814
00:46:01,815 --> 00:46:04,085
She's quick-witted
and nimble on her feet.

815
00:46:04,925 --> 00:46:06,824
She moves faster than Gil Dong.

816
00:46:06,824 --> 00:46:08,355
- A soda.
- Thanks.

817
00:46:15,235 --> 00:46:16,934
Take your time.
You might get an upset stomach.

818
00:46:19,665 --> 00:46:21,704
I ran because I was late.

819
00:46:24,545 --> 00:46:27,244
Why did you ask to see me?

820
00:46:30,114 --> 00:46:33,884
Do Jun. I'll be very direct.

821
00:46:34,585 --> 00:46:37,324
Can you drive?

822
00:46:38,125 --> 00:46:39,384
Yes, I can.

823
00:46:39,384 --> 00:46:40,994
At night,
I work as a driver for hire.

824
00:46:41,925 --> 00:46:43,195
You're a driver for hire?

825
00:46:44,695 --> 00:46:46,425
You must be good at driving, then.

826
00:46:47,594 --> 00:46:49,994
Then Do Jun.

827
00:46:50,934 --> 00:46:53,165
Instead of working multiple jobs,

828
00:46:54,105 --> 00:46:56,844
how about you work for my family?

829
00:46:57,545 --> 00:46:58,545
Pardon?

830
00:46:59,704 --> 00:47:02,344
You must know my daughter Ma Ri...

831
00:47:02,775 --> 00:47:05,384
needs a driver and bodyguard.

832
00:47:06,244 --> 00:47:08,915
The person who had that job...

833
00:47:08,915 --> 00:47:11,154
quit suddenly for personal reasons.

834
00:47:12,724 --> 00:47:16,255
Do you think
you could work for us...

835
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:19,695
and take over that job?

836
00:47:20,665 --> 00:47:22,565
- Me?
- Yes.

837
00:47:22,795 --> 00:47:27,005
Ma Ri thinks of you as a brother
and likes you so much,

838
00:47:27,005 --> 00:47:28,335
and feels comfortable around you.

839
00:47:29,804 --> 00:47:32,404
I'm pretty sure
the salary will be more than...

840
00:47:33,404 --> 00:47:36,915
what you make
working multiple part-time jobs.

841
00:47:39,684 --> 00:47:42,085
If you're okay with it,
we can provide...

842
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,384
food and lodging too.

843
00:47:45,755 --> 00:47:47,025
Food and lodging too?

844
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:50,324
Thank you.

845
00:47:50,965 --> 00:47:52,025
Do Jun.

846
00:47:53,364 --> 00:47:55,335
Welcome. You actually came over.

847
00:47:55,335 --> 00:47:56,695
Yes. Hi.

848
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:58,634
Welcome, Do Jun.

849
00:47:58,665 --> 00:47:59,934
- Hello.
- Hi.

850
00:48:00,574 --> 00:48:03,304
Welcome.
Did you quit your other jobs?

851
00:48:03,434 --> 00:48:04,445
Yes.

852
00:48:04,804 --> 00:48:06,775
I can't believe
we'll live in the same house.

853
00:48:06,775 --> 00:48:08,945
Does that mean
I can see you every day?

854
00:48:09,574 --> 00:48:11,244
Is this a dream?

855
00:48:13,344 --> 00:48:14,514
It's not a dream.

856
00:48:16,014 --> 00:48:19,154
I'm grateful you accepted the offer.

857
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:21,795
Not at all. I should thank you.

858
00:48:23,324 --> 00:48:24,324
Hey.

859
00:48:24,764 --> 00:48:27,364
Is he the man
who will replace Mr. Kang?

860
00:48:27,434 --> 00:48:28,434
Yes.

861
00:48:28,434 --> 00:48:30,904
This is Ma Ri's great aunt.

862
00:48:31,235 --> 00:48:33,034
Hello. I'm Park Do Jun.

863
00:48:34,375 --> 00:48:36,775
- I'll show him the annex.
- Okay.

864
00:48:36,775 --> 00:48:38,505
- Come with me, Do Jun.
- Okay.

865
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:40,974
See you.

866
00:48:41,545 --> 00:48:43,415
- I want to come too.
- Do you?

867
00:48:45,244 --> 00:48:47,915
Is he the guy who helped Ma Ri?

868
00:48:48,454 --> 00:48:49,985
Isn't he too young?

869
00:48:50,554 --> 00:48:51,554
He is.

870
00:48:52,125 --> 00:48:54,525
Can someone that young
take good care of Ma Ri?

871
00:48:55,255 --> 00:48:57,925
He's young,
but he's honest and cautious.

872
00:48:57,925 --> 00:48:59,295
I think he'll do fine.

873
00:48:59,795 --> 00:49:03,094
That's much better than a sly person
whom we can't figure out.

874
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:05,404
He does look nice and sweet.

875
00:49:05,404 --> 00:49:06,434
Yes.

876
00:49:07,534 --> 00:49:08,704
- Come in.
- Thanks.

877
00:49:12,045 --> 00:49:13,074
Gosh.

878
00:49:13,715 --> 00:49:14,915
What an amazing place.

879
00:49:15,145 --> 00:49:16,844
Do you like it, Do Jun?

880
00:49:16,844 --> 00:49:18,215
Yes. I like it so much.

881
00:49:18,945 --> 00:49:22,054
It feels like a field compared to
the tiny studios I'm used to.

882
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:26,925
You can do your washing
in the laundry room in there.

883
00:49:27,724 --> 00:49:30,295
Our housekeeper Ms. Yeoju
will take care of your food.

884
00:49:30,295 --> 00:49:33,125
If you need anything,
tell Ms. Yeoju.

885
00:49:33,125 --> 00:49:35,295
I'll do that. Thank you.

886
00:49:36,965 --> 00:49:38,005
Ma Ri.

887
00:49:38,465 --> 00:49:40,404
Shall we go so Do Jun can rest?

888
00:49:40,675 --> 00:49:41,704
Yes, Mom.

889
00:49:41,974 --> 00:49:44,275
Do Jun. Unpack and rest.

890
00:49:44,275 --> 00:49:46,244
- I'll be in touch.
- Okay.

891
00:49:47,014 --> 00:49:48,145
Let's go.

892
00:49:48,145 --> 00:49:49,445
- Shall we?
- Thank you.

893
00:50:07,994 --> 00:50:09,065
Do Ra.

894
00:50:09,665 --> 00:50:11,404
I'm being strong and I'm doing well.

895
00:50:13,065 --> 00:50:14,804
I'll work hard
to make a lot of money.

896
00:50:14,804 --> 00:50:17,005
And I'll go back to school
and get my degree.

897
00:50:17,804 --> 00:50:19,045
Don't worry about me.

898
00:50:20,415 --> 00:50:22,175
Just forget all about us
and rest in peace.

899
00:50:36,125 --> 00:50:37,195
Are you okay?

900
00:50:37,425 --> 00:50:38,425
Oh, dear.

901
00:50:38,594 --> 00:50:40,934
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

902
00:50:41,534 --> 00:50:43,235
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

903
00:50:43,235 --> 00:50:45,704
I should've controlled myself.

904
00:50:45,704 --> 00:50:47,574
It's my mistake.

905
00:50:52,904 --> 00:50:55,844
Ji Young, you made his nose bleed.

906
00:50:56,415 --> 00:50:57,415
I'm sorry.

907
00:50:58,184 --> 00:50:59,184
I'm so sorry.

908
00:50:59,184 --> 00:51:01,384
It's no problem.
I know you didn't do it on purpose.

909
00:51:02,215 --> 00:51:04,684
Director Ko! The dress is here!

910
00:51:05,355 --> 00:51:06,554
Let's start the shoot then.

911
00:51:06,925 --> 00:51:08,025
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

912
00:51:08,295 --> 00:51:09,724
Ji Young, I'm fine.

913
00:51:09,724 --> 00:51:10,965
Don't worry about me.
Let's get back to work.

914
00:51:11,895 --> 00:51:13,125
I'm sorry.

915
00:51:13,965 --> 00:51:14,965
Let's go.

916
00:51:16,934 --> 00:51:19,934
I'm such a fool.

917
00:51:20,474 --> 00:51:22,335
It's not like
I'll be a dodgeball player.

918
00:51:23,304 --> 00:51:25,844
Why did I throw the ball so hard?

919
00:51:27,445 --> 00:51:30,415
He must think
that I'm all brawn and no brain.

920
00:51:33,014 --> 00:51:34,384
You were right.

921
00:51:36,184 --> 00:51:37,184
The thing is,

922
00:51:38,784 --> 00:51:40,695
everything I said was a lie.

923
00:51:44,094 --> 00:51:45,125
No.

924
00:51:45,895 --> 00:51:46,965
That can't be true.

925
00:51:48,735 --> 00:51:50,735
Okay. That was great.

926
00:51:52,264 --> 00:51:54,134
We're done with the beach scene.

927
00:51:54,404 --> 00:51:55,835
Let's wrap things up and go back.

928
00:51:56,134 --> 00:51:58,574
- Okay.
- Yes, sir. Good work.

929
00:51:58,574 --> 00:51:59,605
Good work.

930
00:52:02,545 --> 00:52:03,844
Wait.

931
00:52:04,715 --> 00:52:07,915
Is this the last day of the shoot?

932
00:52:09,614 --> 00:52:11,054
We were supposed
to finish it tomorrow,

933
00:52:11,054 --> 00:52:13,184
but the script was revised,
so we got to finish it today.

934
00:52:14,525 --> 00:52:15,554
Does that mean...

935
00:52:16,125 --> 00:52:18,264
you all are going back to Seoul now?

936
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:19,594
Yes.

937
00:52:19,895 --> 00:52:21,965
Ji Young, please make sure
to wrap things up well.

938
00:52:22,434 --> 00:52:23,434
Okay.

939
00:52:32,204 --> 00:52:33,244
What now?

940
00:52:34,675 --> 00:52:36,675
I can't work here anymore?

941
00:52:50,494 --> 00:52:51,494
Ji Young.

942
00:52:52,565 --> 00:52:54,094
What's wrong?

943
00:52:55,034 --> 00:52:56,735
Did Director Ko scold you?

944
00:52:57,804 --> 00:53:00,065
What did you do wrong?

945
00:53:06,145 --> 00:53:07,974
It's not like that.

946
00:53:12,045 --> 00:53:15,085
They are done with the beach scene.

947
00:53:16,054 --> 00:53:18,324
So they're going back to Seoul.

948
00:53:19,985 --> 00:53:21,025
What?

949
00:53:21,654 --> 00:53:24,695
How could the shoot end so soon?

950
00:53:26,025 --> 00:53:28,364
Grandma, I guess
I shouldn't have started this.

951
00:53:29,965 --> 00:53:32,565
Now that I can't work
at the filming location anymore,

952
00:53:33,304 --> 00:53:35,804
I feel like
there's a huge void in my heart.

953
00:53:36,275 --> 00:53:38,744
It's like
I just got dumped by a man.

954
00:53:40,815 --> 00:53:42,145
What do I do now?

955
00:53:44,415 --> 00:53:45,985
What should we do?

956
00:53:48,614 --> 00:53:50,855
Ji Young, you're here.

957
00:53:54,054 --> 00:53:55,054
Well...

958
00:53:55,594 --> 00:53:58,625
You all are going back to Seoul.

959
00:53:59,395 --> 00:54:01,264
So I just came back here.

960
00:54:02,295 --> 00:54:04,034
Ji Young, thank you
for what you've done so far.

961
00:54:04,364 --> 00:54:06,665
Your pay will be deposited
in your account.

962
00:54:07,335 --> 00:54:10,175
The production crew is leaving now.

963
00:54:10,744 --> 00:54:12,904
But I was wondering if you were
interested in working with us.

964
00:54:13,404 --> 00:54:15,474
We'd like you
to keep working with us.

965
00:54:18,915 --> 00:54:19,915
My gosh.

966
00:54:20,654 --> 00:54:21,654
Are you serious?

967
00:54:23,815 --> 00:54:24,824
I can't believe this.

968
00:54:25,284 --> 00:54:27,224
Of course, I want to work with you.

969
00:54:28,195 --> 00:54:32,324
I'll do whatever you tell me to do.

970
00:54:32,895 --> 00:54:35,235
Then tell us
when you can move to Seoul.

971
00:54:35,695 --> 00:54:37,665
Ma'am, I'm busy,
so I should get going now.

972
00:54:37,965 --> 00:54:39,134
- Okay.
- All right.

973
00:54:39,134 --> 00:54:41,735
- Go back home safely.
- My gosh. Take care.

974
00:54:42,105 --> 00:54:44,974
- I can't believe this.
- Grandma!

975
00:54:45,244 --> 00:54:46,244
Oh, dear.

976
00:54:46,375 --> 00:54:48,344
This is so nice.

977
00:54:49,514 --> 00:54:50,514
Oh, dear.

978
00:54:51,315 --> 00:54:53,415
Why didn't I think of you?

979
00:54:59,025 --> 00:55:00,054
Forget it, Grandma.

980
00:55:00,485 --> 00:55:03,054
I'm not going to Seoul.

981
00:55:03,855 --> 00:55:05,395
I was out of my mind.

982
00:55:06,864 --> 00:55:08,034
I'm not moving to Seoul.

983
00:55:08,835 --> 00:55:11,034
Come to think of it,

984
00:55:11,465 --> 00:55:13,904
the work is really demanding there.

985
00:55:14,474 --> 00:55:18,145
I want to stay here
and sell kalguksu with you.

986
00:55:18,904 --> 00:55:20,175
Living in Seoul isn't for me.

987
00:55:21,375 --> 00:55:22,744
I should call the director.

988
00:55:23,614 --> 00:55:27,014
What are you talking about?

989
00:55:28,114 --> 00:55:32,585
You just told me you loved the job.
You even cried.

990
00:55:33,454 --> 00:55:36,954
You don't have to worry about me.
Just go to Seoul.

991
00:55:37,494 --> 00:55:39,565
I have money.

992
00:55:40,195 --> 00:55:45,105
I have enough money
to get you a room.

993
00:55:45,235 --> 00:55:49,005
So you should go to Seoul
and do what you want to do.

994
00:55:50,875 --> 00:55:54,815
But I can't leave you here alone.

995
00:55:55,945 --> 00:55:58,815
How would I possibly
leave you alone?

996
00:56:00,684 --> 00:56:05,054
You know how you put a flower
in your hair and start singing.

997
00:56:05,625 --> 00:56:08,295
What if you wander around outside...

998
00:56:08,425 --> 00:56:10,625
and end up getting lost?

999
00:56:12,594 --> 00:56:15,134
You don't have to worry about that.

1000
00:56:15,695 --> 00:56:20,934
All the people in the neighborhood
are like my guardians.

1001
00:56:21,304 --> 00:56:24,005
Even a dog on the street knows me.

1002
00:56:24,304 --> 00:56:27,675
And Auntie Duk Ja next door
will take good care of me.

1003
00:56:27,875 --> 00:56:30,175
So you don't need to worry.

1004
00:56:30,175 --> 00:56:32,384
Just go and do what you like.

1005
00:56:32,384 --> 00:56:34,585
That's my wish.

1006
00:56:35,154 --> 00:56:37,485
Grandma.

1007
00:56:38,184 --> 00:56:39,224
Oh, dear.

1008
00:56:39,824 --> 00:56:40,855
Gosh.

1009
00:56:41,525 --> 00:56:43,954
My dear baby.

1010
00:56:44,764 --> 00:56:48,264
How would I leave you behind?

1011
00:56:48,264 --> 00:56:49,264
It's all right.

1012
00:56:51,835 --> 00:56:52,835
I'm home.

1013
00:56:52,835 --> 00:56:55,034
Jin Dan, I'm glad you're here.

1014
00:56:56,434 --> 00:56:59,145
I've been worried sick about you.

1015
00:57:00,545 --> 00:57:01,545
Jin Dan.

1016
00:57:01,545 --> 00:57:04,384
Why don't you go see
a neuropsychiatrist with me?

1017
00:57:04,384 --> 00:57:05,585
I'm coming with you.

1018
00:57:06,514 --> 00:57:09,114
I don't need a neuropsychiatrist.
I'm fine.

1019
00:57:09,614 --> 00:57:11,125
You're not fine at all.

1020
00:57:11,324 --> 00:57:13,025
You're not in your right mind now.

1021
00:57:13,154 --> 00:57:14,525
You have a strange dream
every night.

1022
00:57:15,554 --> 00:57:16,824
I'm really fine.

1023
00:57:17,724 --> 00:57:20,165
Going there
made me feel a lot better.

1024
00:57:21,195 --> 00:57:23,335
It took a load off my mind.

1025
00:57:24,304 --> 00:57:26,235
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I mean it.

1026
00:57:26,864 --> 00:57:30,034
And I'll get my act together now.
So you don't have to worry.

1027
00:57:30,605 --> 00:57:32,505
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1028
00:57:33,344 --> 00:57:34,344
Mom.

1029
00:57:36,275 --> 00:57:37,275
Here.

1030
00:57:37,784 --> 00:57:38,784
What is this?

1031
00:57:40,985 --> 00:57:42,654
It's a special gift for you.

1032
00:57:43,985 --> 00:57:46,485
A slight fall can cause a serious injury
for a woman of your age.

1033
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:48,695
You should take good care
of your health.

1034
00:57:49,224 --> 00:57:51,224
Actually,
I see many people take this.

1035
00:57:53,065 --> 00:57:55,864
Mom, take this first.

1036
00:57:56,094 --> 00:57:57,195
- Okay.
- Here.

1037
00:58:04,275 --> 00:58:05,375
Thanks, Jin Dan.

1038
00:58:05,804 --> 00:58:07,375
You're all I've got.

1039
00:58:08,045 --> 00:58:09,045
I know that.

1040
00:58:13,145 --> 00:58:14,415
I told you...

1041
00:58:15,514 --> 00:58:16,915
that I would tank...

1042
00:58:18,425 --> 00:58:19,684
Park Do Ra's career.

1043
00:58:20,684 --> 00:58:22,224
I'll have her forgotten
as a celebrity.

1044
00:58:24,025 --> 00:58:25,594
You made me out to be a moron...

1045
00:58:27,125 --> 00:58:29,195
and took advantage of me!

1046
00:58:30,565 --> 00:58:31,965
Did you think...

1047
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:35,034
there wouldn't be any consequences?

1048
00:58:41,815 --> 00:58:43,415
It's Gong Jin Dan, that jerk...

1049
00:58:44,945 --> 00:58:46,485
who made Do Ra die.

1050
00:58:48,215 --> 00:58:50,815
That darn article about sponsorship.

1051
00:58:52,525 --> 00:58:54,695
That was his doing.

1052
00:58:58,195 --> 00:59:00,864
I'm going to make him pay.

1053
00:59:02,764 --> 00:59:04,835
I blame that jerk
for the whole thing.

1054
00:59:07,134 --> 00:59:08,335
That scumbag.

1055
00:59:10,335 --> 00:59:11,375
My mortal enemy.

1056
00:59:23,755 --> 00:59:25,855
(Samcheon Penitentiary)

1057
00:59:39,005 --> 00:59:40,534
- Mom!
- Do Sik.

1058
00:59:41,235 --> 00:59:45,445
Do Sik.

1059
00:59:48,145 --> 00:59:49,514
Mom, you've been through a lot.

1060
00:59:49,945 --> 00:59:51,145
Eat this first.

1061
00:59:51,145 --> 00:59:52,585
- What's this?
- You eat tofu when you're released.

1062
00:59:52,815 --> 00:59:54,684
- Tofu? Take this.
- Okay.

1063
00:59:55,654 --> 00:59:57,585
Do I have to eat tofu?

1064
00:59:58,224 --> 01:00:00,125
- My goodness.
- Look at you.

1065
01:00:05,565 --> 01:00:06,864
Hey, what about Do Jun?

1066
01:00:07,594 --> 01:00:08,634
Did you find him?

1067
01:00:09,665 --> 01:00:12,204
He changed his phone number.
I can't reach him at all.

1068
01:00:13,335 --> 01:00:16,034
That brat. How can he do this
to his own mom?

1069
01:00:17,534 --> 01:00:19,574
- Did you get me a phone?
- Yes.

1070
01:00:21,215 --> 01:00:22,215
Here.

1071
01:00:24,744 --> 01:00:27,884
I have a few things to take care of,
so text me the address.

1072
01:00:27,884 --> 01:00:29,014
I'll get there later on.

1073
01:00:29,014 --> 01:00:30,054
Where are you going...

1074
01:00:30,054 --> 01:00:31,425
and what business do you have
when you just got out?

1075
01:00:31,654 --> 01:00:34,054
It's none of your concern.
Here. Take this.

1076
01:00:37,525 --> 01:00:38,965
Where are you going?

1077
01:00:38,965 --> 01:00:42,134
Let go of me! Tell Mr. Gong
that Baek Mi Ja is here.

1078
01:00:42,934 --> 01:00:43,934
You can't go in there.

1079
01:00:48,474 --> 01:00:49,704
Mr. Gong, it's been a while.

1080
01:00:51,005 --> 01:00:52,105
Have you been well?

1081
01:00:53,445 --> 01:00:55,415
You seem to be doing well...

1082
01:00:56,244 --> 01:00:59,014
after what you did
to burn my entire family.

1083
01:00:59,815 --> 01:01:00,945
Mr. Cho!

1084
01:01:01,884 --> 01:01:03,355
Did you let someone like her
enter my office?

1085
01:01:04,215 --> 01:01:05,224
I'm sorry, sir.

1086
01:01:05,525 --> 01:01:07,154
You must leave. Ma'am...

1087
01:01:07,154 --> 01:01:08,154
Let go!

1088
01:01:08,154 --> 01:01:11,324
I'm not leaving. Kill me instead.

1089
01:01:11,324 --> 01:01:14,224
Let go of me.
I'll only leave in a body bag,

1090
01:01:14,395 --> 01:01:16,094
so kill me if you have to.

1091
01:01:23,175 --> 01:01:24,204
Mr. Cho,

1092
01:01:25,605 --> 01:01:26,645
leave the room.

1093
01:01:27,204 --> 01:01:28,244
Yes, sir.

1094
01:01:34,454 --> 01:01:35,485
Come on.

1095
01:01:36,215 --> 01:01:38,454
You should repent quietly
after being released from prison.

1096
01:01:39,324 --> 01:01:42,355
How dare you come here
and cause a scene?

1097
01:01:46,824 --> 01:01:49,165
You're the reason my Do Ra died.

1098
01:01:50,434 --> 01:01:52,764
If you hadn't killed
all of her advertisement deals,

1099
01:01:54,065 --> 01:01:56,505
she would still be alive,
and I wouldn't be in this mess.

1100
01:01:57,634 --> 01:01:59,704
That dirty article
about her having a sponsor.

1101
01:01:59,904 --> 01:02:01,614
You're the one behind it.

1102
01:02:01,715 --> 01:02:04,485
You! You're a murderer.

1103
01:02:06,545 --> 01:02:07,855
Look here, lady.

1104
01:02:08,654 --> 01:02:09,855
Watch what you're saying.

1105
01:02:10,514 --> 01:02:12,525
Why is it my fault
that your daughter died?

1106
01:02:13,224 --> 01:02:15,224
- Where's your proof?
- Proof?

1107
01:02:16,625 --> 01:02:19,025
No one but you
would've done that to her,

1108
01:02:19,025 --> 01:02:20,565
so why do I need proof?

1109
01:02:20,565 --> 01:02:23,134
Your gambling habit
is what ruined her life,

1110
01:02:24,395 --> 01:02:26,165
so who are you
spewing this nonsense at?

1111
01:02:26,634 --> 01:02:27,875
My Do Ra...

1112
01:02:28,675 --> 01:02:31,605
wouldn't have died if it hadn't been
for that scandalous article.

1113
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:35,645
That was you.

1114
01:02:36,574 --> 01:02:39,315
You will compensate me
for killing my daughter...

1115
01:02:39,315 --> 01:02:40,344
and ruining my life.

1116
01:02:40,915 --> 01:02:42,454
Compensate me with money!

1117
01:02:42,855 --> 01:02:43,884
What?

1118
01:02:44,154 --> 01:02:45,755
I'm the one
who should be compensated.

1119
01:02:46,824 --> 01:02:49,094
You and your daughter
played me like a fool,

1120
01:02:49,195 --> 01:02:50,625
so how dare you demand compensation?

1121
01:02:51,025 --> 01:02:53,324
Mr. Cho!

1122
01:02:53,795 --> 01:02:54,835
Yes, Mr. Gong?

1123
01:02:56,295 --> 01:02:58,335
Drag this crazy cow out of here.

1124
01:02:58,934 --> 01:03:01,065
Have security kick her out.

1125
01:03:02,105 --> 01:03:04,134
If she ever enters my office again,

1126
01:03:05,505 --> 01:03:07,105
I'll fire you as well.

1127
01:03:08,474 --> 01:03:09,815
- Do it!
- Yes, sir.

1128
01:03:10,315 --> 01:03:12,145
- Ma'am, please leave.
- You!

1129
01:03:12,445 --> 01:03:13,815
I'll make you pay.

1130
01:03:14,315 --> 01:03:16,755
I'll drag you down
if it's the last thing I do.

1131
01:03:17,284 --> 01:03:18,585
Let go!

1132
01:03:18,585 --> 01:03:21,054
Bring back my Do Ra.

1133
01:03:21,695 --> 01:03:24,355
Bring back my Do Ra!

1134
01:03:44,985 --> 01:03:47,145
Goodness. So this is...

1135
01:03:47,145 --> 01:03:48,654
what a broadcasting station
looks like.

1136
01:03:49,614 --> 01:03:52,824
I can't believe I get to work
at a cool place like this.

1137
01:03:53,525 --> 01:03:55,425
This had better not be a dream.

1138
01:03:57,724 --> 01:03:59,364
Gosh, no.

1139
01:04:00,065 --> 01:04:03,364
Since I'm in Seoul,
I should be more sophisticated.

1140
01:04:04,634 --> 01:04:07,165
The sophisticated Ms. Kim Ji Young.

1141
01:04:09,375 --> 01:04:11,275
Ms. Kim, you're here.

1142
01:04:11,875 --> 01:04:13,404
Hello, Assistant Director.

1143
01:04:13,804 --> 01:04:15,375
I just got here.

1144
01:04:15,875 --> 01:04:17,775
The meeting will begin soon,
so hurry along.

1145
01:04:17,844 --> 01:04:19,045
The entire staff has gathered.

1146
01:04:19,384 --> 01:04:21,454
- This way.
- Right.

1147
01:04:23,384 --> 01:04:25,625
Director Ko, Ms. Kim is here.

1148
01:04:25,884 --> 01:04:27,585
Right. Welcome.

1149
01:04:31,824 --> 01:04:32,994
Hello,

1150
01:04:34,025 --> 01:04:36,134
I'm Kim Ji Young...

1151
01:04:36,134 --> 01:04:38,005
who officially begins
her first day at work.

1152
01:04:40,735 --> 01:04:41,974
I hope we get along,

1153
01:04:44,235 --> 01:04:45,244
everyone.

1154
01:04:52,784 --> 01:04:55,585
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1155
01:05:27,684 --> 01:05:31,184
Grandma, I'm now someone
who works at a broadcasting station.

1156
01:05:31,784 --> 01:05:33,784
I hear the student
who rented out our room...

1157
01:05:33,784 --> 01:05:35,154
isn't moving in.

1158
01:05:35,425 --> 01:05:37,994
There isn't a place in Seoul
where I can live.

1159
01:05:37,994 --> 01:05:40,125
I know a place.
Would you like to take a look?

1160
01:05:40,125 --> 01:05:42,735
Park Do Ra's body
still hasn't been found.

1161
01:05:43,094 --> 01:05:45,465
Could she be alive
and hiding out somewhere?

1162
01:05:45,505 --> 01:05:46,565
Is it true...

1163
01:05:46,565 --> 01:05:47,864
that Park Do Ra killed herself...

1164
01:05:47,864 --> 01:05:49,005
because she traded sexual favors
for money...

1165
01:05:49,074 --> 01:05:50,735
to cover her mom's gambling debt?

1166
01:05:50,775 --> 01:05:52,775
Who do you think you are
running your mouth like that?

1167
01:05:52,775 --> 01:05:53,904
"Straightforward Romance?"

1168
01:05:53,904 --> 01:05:55,614
I don't think
I ever watched this series.

1169
01:05:55,775 --> 01:05:59,344
For some reason,
the title hits close to home.

1170
01:06:00,194 --> 01:06:02,208
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
