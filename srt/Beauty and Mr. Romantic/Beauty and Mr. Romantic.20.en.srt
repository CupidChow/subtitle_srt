00:00:00,104 --> 00:00:07,302
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,739
Anyway, I came by today...

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,140
to seek approval...

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,909
for what I'm about to propose.

5
00:00:20,409 --> 00:00:22,450
(Episode 20)

6
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,990
I believed Ma Ri's interest
in Pil Seung...

7
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,420
was that
of a young girl daydreaming.

8
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:31,159
However, talking to her...

9
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:35,659
made me realize...

10
00:00:35,659 --> 00:00:37,870
that her feelings for him
are genuine.

11
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,370
Right, of course.
It seemed that way.

12
00:00:43,639 --> 00:00:46,010
Ma Ri may not be mature enough,

13
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,839
but she is at an age to get married.

14
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:50,680
That is why I'm saying this...

15
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,980
since I can't turn a blind eye
as her father.

16
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:54,750
You see,

17
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,650
I've been fond of Pil Seung...

18
00:00:59,349 --> 00:01:01,620
for quite a long time now.

19
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,900
For that reason,
I was going to meet him separately.

20
00:01:11,269 --> 00:01:13,630
However, since Ma Ri lacks
in many ways,

21
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:18,410
I believed it was right for me
to seek approval from you first.

22
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,969
That is why I visited today
despite everything.

23
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,279
Goodness.

24
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,150
If we approve,

25
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,419
will Pil Seung marry
into a wealthy family?

26
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,089
I understand
how shocked you must be.

27
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,960
Ma Ri lacks in many ways,

28
00:01:40,029 --> 00:01:42,430
but she is kind
and has a pure heart.

29
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,400
She is getting much better as well.

30
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,199
Ma Ri...

31
00:01:48,139 --> 00:01:49,799
is my only child.

32
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,439
Nothing is worth more...

33
00:01:54,639 --> 00:01:55,880
than her happiness.

34
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,749
I could give her everything I have.

35
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,150
What did you say?

36
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,219
You were at Sun Young's just now?

37
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:09,919
Yes.

38
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:12,859
I went to ask
if I could ask Pil Seung...

39
00:02:12,859 --> 00:02:14,059
about him and Ma Ri.

40
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,630
I sprung this upon them
out of nowhere...

41
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,070
which is why
they wanted time to think.

42
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:21,000
Honey!

43
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,169
What is the matter with you?

44
00:02:25,369 --> 00:02:28,139
How could you do such a thing
without discussing it with me first?

45
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:30,679
Do you honestly think
that this makes sense?

46
00:02:31,649 --> 00:02:34,480
Such a thing?

47
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,220
It's not like I proposed
something outrageous.

48
00:02:37,619 --> 00:02:40,290
Why are you overreacting?

49
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:46,929
You should've thought of a way
to gently discourage her.

50
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,530
You're making things worse
than they already are.

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,570
This is exactly why
I went there alone.

52
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,840
You're objecting to it
even though you haven't tried.

53
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,070
What could I not do
when this is for Ma Ri?

54
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,139
Ma Ri likes him so much.

55
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:05,910
Don't you care about our daughter?

56
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,679
She has been crying her eyes out.

57
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,750
Doesn't that kill you?

58
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,320
My heart has been torn into pieces.

59
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,350
If I could,

60
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:18,090
I'd gladly buy Pil Seung's love.

61
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,299
What did you just say?

62
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,869
That's right. Good for you.

63
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,970
He must've been desperate...

64
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,070
judging by how he went over there
practically groveling.

65
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,079
But rather than being
a shoulder he can lean on,

66
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,709
you're biting his head off.

67
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,179
Tell me about it.

68
00:03:38,179 --> 00:03:40,280
You're also fond of Pil Seung.

69
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,250
It'd be nice for them
to end up together.

70
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,750
Honey.

71
00:03:45,149 --> 00:03:48,760
I could get down on my knees
if it's for Ma Ri.

72
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,060
If you're worried...

73
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,730
about ruining your friendship
with Ms. Kim,

74
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,859
I'll take responsibility
for that too.

75
00:03:55,429 --> 00:03:58,669
Honey, for Ma Ri's sake,

76
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,970
let's make this happen.

77
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,510
What do we do about this?

78
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,549
What else?

79
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:18,549
Didn't you hear Chairman Gong?

80
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:21,090
The second Pil Seung
marries into that family,

81
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,660
he'll have wealthy in-laws.

82
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,290
An opportunity like this...

83
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,700
is rarer than buying yourself
a winning lottery ticket.

84
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,600
This is an opportunity
that was sent from above.

85
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,299
It's not even up for debate.
I'm all for it.

86
00:04:34,299 --> 00:04:36,140
I don't like this at all.

87
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:38,309
I want Pil Seung
to marry someone normal...

88
00:04:38,309 --> 00:04:42,140
from a normal family like ours
and live a quiet and happy life.

89
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,280
A quiet and happy life
paying back debts?

90
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:48,980
Besides, what's wrong with Ma Ri?

91
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,319
There are all sorts
of nasty women in this world,

92
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:55,259
and I'd take Ma Ri
over a woman who might betray him.

93
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:56,919
Don't you agree, Hyun Chul?

94
00:04:57,119 --> 00:04:59,090
- What?
- Is that what you also think?

95
00:05:00,359 --> 00:05:02,460
What Pil Seung wants
is more important.

96
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,730
If he likes Ma Ri,
everything will be good.

97
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,470
If not, it won't work out.

98
00:05:07,869 --> 00:05:10,999
Yes. I too think how Pil Seung feels
is more important.

99
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,439
Yes.

100
00:05:16,179 --> 00:05:17,210
What about you?

101
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:20,850
I like Ma Ri too.

102
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:24,850
But if Pil Seung
were to marry Ma Ri,

103
00:05:25,249 --> 00:05:28,660
he'd have to look after her forever.

104
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:32,059
So what if you're rich?
It's best to live without stress.

105
00:05:41,739 --> 00:05:44,669
Yes. I agree with Sun Young.

106
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:47,840
But if we miss out on
such an opportunity,

107
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:50,109
I think we'll regret it
for the rest of our lives.

108
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:53,549
One thing I learned
in my lifetime...

109
00:05:53,809 --> 00:05:55,780
is that money is the most important thing
in the world.

110
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,989
Money looks after you
and is the source of happiness.

111
00:05:59,489 --> 00:06:02,520
If Pil Seung were to say
he likes Ma Ri,

112
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:04,689
we'd all get to live a better life.

113
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:05,960
Wait.

114
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:08,600
Hang on.

115
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,530
What if Pil Seung really says...

116
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,700
he'll marry into
the APP Group family?

117
00:06:14,299 --> 00:06:17,700
What about us?
What happens to us then?

118
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,770
What?

119
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:21,239
I'm home.

120
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,739
Welcome home, Pil Seung.

121
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:25,309
What?

122
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,850
Me first.

123
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,520
Chairman Gong Jin Taek said...

124
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:34,819
he wanted me to be his son-in-law?

125
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,290
Yes. He said he has liked
you since you first met long ago.

126
00:06:41,559 --> 00:06:45,129
Hey. Ma Ri likes you so much,

127
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,999
if you make up your mind,

128
00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:49,239
you can marry into a rich family.

129
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,239
APP Group will be yours, Pil Seung.

130
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:53,309
Mother.

131
00:06:53,809 --> 00:06:55,710
Don't be like that.

132
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,540
We haven't heard from Pil Seung yet.

133
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:02,350
Pil Seung. Think very carefully.

134
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:05,220
A split-second decision
changes the rest of your life.

135
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:09,090
This could change
your life and our future.

136
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,359
I...

137
00:07:18,929 --> 00:07:20,069
I'm not interested.

138
00:07:21,739 --> 00:07:23,700
I don't know Ms. Gong well.

139
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,169
To me,
she's just Ms. Jang's daughter.

140
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,640
That Ma Ri became disabled
in an accident.

141
00:07:28,809 --> 00:07:31,179
Is that what you're worried about?

142
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,549
If that's your problem,
you don't have to worry at all.

143
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:37,450
From what I saw,

144
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,950
Ma Ri isn't that tactful
when she speaks,

145
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,819
but she's sweet and naive.

146
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:44,419
She's just adorable.

147
00:07:47,489 --> 00:07:48,730
Regardless of everything else,

148
00:07:49,359 --> 00:07:51,359
I don't want to
date anyone right now.

149
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,169
So Mom, Dad.

150
00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:55,470
Talk to Chairman Gong for me.

151
00:07:55,739 --> 00:07:56,970
So there's no misunderstanding.

152
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,140
I'll go to my room now.

153
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,169
- Yes. Go ahead.
- Okay.

154
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,280
My goodness.

155
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:07,450
Pil Seung, that fool.

156
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,780
He's not one of us.

157
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,879
Mother.

158
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,189
What? Am I wrong?

159
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,960
If he were to say yes,

160
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,790
his dad could become
a CEO of a subsidiary,

161
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,660
and we could all live in luxury.

162
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,259
How could he say no
without even thinking about it?

163
00:08:22,929 --> 00:08:25,900
He doesn't appreciate
how we raised him up.

164
00:08:26,299 --> 00:08:29,200
He's the worthless son of scum.

165
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,439
- Mom.
- Mother.

166
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:34,609
Mr. Gong.

167
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,780
Why didn't you go inside?

168
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,409
I'm sorry.

169
00:08:40,609 --> 00:08:42,950
They're closed
to renovate the interior.

170
00:08:43,619 --> 00:08:45,050
I should've checked.

171
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,019
What now, then?

172
00:08:51,359 --> 00:08:53,190
Would you like webfoot octopus?

173
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,430
We're just a five-minute walk...

174
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,700
from a webfoot octopus place
that cooks on open flames.

175
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,269
How about we eat there today?

176
00:09:01,369 --> 00:09:03,239
- Webfoot octopus?
- Yes.

177
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,509
It's so good, you wouldn't notice
if one of us died during the meal.

178
00:09:07,239 --> 00:09:08,879
Trust me.

179
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,310
It's a killer place.

180
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,850
Let's go.

181
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,509
Okay. Let's go.

182
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:16,920
I'll see how good the food is.

183
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,289
Okay. Follow me.

184
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,350
I will.

185
00:09:20,749 --> 00:09:21,759
Gosh.

186
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:23,389
Hey.

187
00:09:23,989 --> 00:09:25,460
- Why is it raining?
- Goodness.

188
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:27,259
- Oh, no.
- The weather forecast was wrong.

189
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:28,999
He can't ruin his suit again.

190
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,800
This must've cost thousands too.

191
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:32,769
This won't do.

192
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:35,999
What...

193
00:09:40,369 --> 00:09:41,409
Let's go.

194
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:53,420
Come on, Mr. Gong.

195
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,560
You'll get all wet. Let's go.

196
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,659
Okay.

197
00:10:09,999 --> 00:10:11,539
Work ended early today.

198
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,509
Why isn't she back yet?

199
00:10:16,909 --> 00:10:18,080
Is she with someone?

200
00:10:39,499 --> 00:10:40,800
I could walk you to the door.

201
00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:43,139
No, it's fine.

202
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,700
The rain stopped,

203
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,269
and I'm grateful
you brought me this far.

204
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:49,340
I live right over there.

205
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,550
I enjoyed dinner. Thanks.

206
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:55,920
I should thank you.

207
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,989
Does that mean
we have four more dinners left?

208
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,289
Yes. Four more to go.

209
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,659
Get home safely, then.

210
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,629
Bye. See you.

211
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,070
My gosh.

212
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:23,680
You startled me.

213
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,279
My liver almost popped out.

214
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:30,580
What were you doing,

215
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,389
standing there like a ghost?

216
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,420
Why were you
stepping out of Mr. Gong's car?

217
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,629
I had dinner with him.

218
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:41,159
He dropped me off because it rained.

219
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,529
Why would you...

220
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,100
have dinner with Mr. Gong?

221
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,769
Because he let me buy him dinner...

222
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:51,739
instead of paying for his clothes.

223
00:11:52,869 --> 00:11:53,869
What?

224
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,609
Am I not allowed
to eat with Mr. Gong?

225
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,109
Don't have meals with him.

226
00:11:59,249 --> 00:12:00,609
Don't spend time with him either!

227
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:01,749
Why not?

228
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:05,420
Who are you to tell me
who I can or can't be with?

229
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,019
Why on earth?

230
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:09,060
What do you mean "why?"

231
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,720
The world is a scary place.

232
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,159
You can't be out this late,
hitching rides with just any man.

233
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,999
As someone who lives with you,
I'm worried about you.

234
00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:20,100
You're being silly again.

235
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:22,840
You're always asking me
to carpool with you.

236
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,739
I hitch rides with you
morning and evening.

237
00:12:25,409 --> 00:12:26,570
What's that?

238
00:12:26,739 --> 00:12:28,109
Aren't you a man?

239
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,680
How is this the same as that?

240
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:32,810
I'm not just any man.

241
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:34,749
I'm the director of the team
you work on.

242
00:12:34,749 --> 00:12:37,279
We live on the same grounds.
I'm someone you can trust!

243
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,720
My goodness.

244
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,389
Mr. Gong's incredibly polite.
He's an utter gentleman.

245
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,590
And Mr. Gong.

246
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:49,600
I ruined his suit
which cost over 5,000 dollars,

247
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,330
but he didn't tell me
to pay him for it.

248
00:12:51,499 --> 00:12:53,230
He was generous enough...

249
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,269
to let me buy him dinner instead.

250
00:12:56,499 --> 00:12:57,539
Ji Young.

251
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,210
I'm looking out for you
and showing concern...

252
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:03,379
as an older brother would.

253
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:05,810
Why are you so twisted?

254
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:06,950
What older brother?

255
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:10,820
Do you and I share blood...

256
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,950
or a family name?

257
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,889
This makes me so uncomfortable.

258
00:13:14,289 --> 00:13:17,460
I'll take care of my own business.

259
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,989
Don't you worry.

260
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:21,830
Take this umbrella.

261
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,029
No, thanks.

262
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,629
Take the umbrella!
You'll catch a cold!

263
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,720
She has been crying her eyes out.

264
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,920
Doesn't that kill you?

265
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,420
My heart has been torn into pieces.

266
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,560
If I could,

267
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:57,230
I'd gladly buy Pil Seung's love.

268
00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:00,869
He won't stop at anything.

269
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,609
What if Pil Seung says
he'll date Ma Ri?

270
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,050
It can't happen.

271
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:13,950
Never.

272
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:23,220
Director Ko's so troublesome.

273
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,259
Who is he to nag
and tell me what not to do?

274
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,359
Why does he care
if I ride someone else's car?

275
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,070
My gosh.

276
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,800
You startled me.

277
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:41,739
Anyway,

278
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:46,980
what was he doing at the bus stop
late at night with an umbrella?

279
00:14:47,909 --> 00:14:49,279
He had two umbrellas.

280
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,550
Was he...

281
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,560
This won't do.

282
00:15:00,989 --> 00:15:03,129
I should end it once and for all.

283
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:11,039
Director Ko, we need to talk.

284
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:12,840
I have something to tell you.

285
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,180
You said you had
something to tell me. What is it?

286
00:15:23,749 --> 00:15:26,450
Director Ko,
I've given it some thought.

287
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,220
You saw me stepping out
of a man's car and got upset.

288
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,789
There's only one
possible reason for that.

289
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:35,289
Are you...

290
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:37,629
feeling jealous?

291
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,269
Don't answer it.
It's obviously jealousy.

292
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:42,739
There's no other explanation.

293
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:48,139
Jealousy? Am I being jealous?

294
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:49,279
Yes.

295
00:15:51,239 --> 00:15:54,109
And what were you doing
at the bus stop?

296
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:56,580
You had two umbrellas.

297
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:00,649
Today, it rained on and off all day.

298
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:03,659
You were worried I'd get rained on,
so you came to pick me up.

299
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,060
- Is that right?
- That's just...

300
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,700
See? You sound startled.
I guess I'm right about that.

301
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,529
No, I just did it...

302
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:16,499
because we work together
and live in the same building.

303
00:16:16,499 --> 00:16:17,700
I was just being nice.

304
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,710
What if you catch a cold
and call in sick?

305
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,609
Then things will be tough
for the rest of us at work.

306
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:24,279
I did it
for the sake of the staff...

307
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:27,249
That's just ridiculous.

308
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,850
That doesn't make any sense.

309
00:16:30,249 --> 00:16:33,190
Everything you've done for me is...

310
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,389
what a man does
for a woman he's interested in.

311
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:37,859
Do you want me
to ask people at work tomorrow?

312
00:16:37,859 --> 00:16:39,090
To see if I'm wrong?

313
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,330
Why would you ask them?

314
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,800
Why would you let your personal life
interfere with your work?

315
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,830
I've already found out
about your feelings,

316
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,730
but why do you keep saying no?

317
00:16:47,129 --> 00:16:49,499
Why do you keep
denying your feelings?

318
00:16:51,499 --> 00:16:53,739
The day you showed up
at my place with some tteokbokki,

319
00:16:53,739 --> 00:16:55,609
you clearly told me...

320
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:58,239
you had your reason
why you couldn't be with me.

321
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,050
What is the reason?

322
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,149
You know what?

323
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,450
Whatever it is, I can handle it.

324
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,519
Because...

325
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,230
I really...

326
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,160
I really like you with all my heart.

327
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,710
I didn't say such a thing.

328
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,279
I don't remember.

329
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:35,009
I don't know
what you're talking about.

330
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,319
I'm sure I heard it.

331
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,720
Do you really not remember
saying that?

332
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,089
I guess
it was just the booze-talking.

333
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,989
I just...

334
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,960
wanted to do something
to help you...

335
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,259
since you just joined my team.

336
00:17:50,829 --> 00:17:53,029
And you were just wandering around
carelessly today,

337
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:54,569
so I was worried
and looked after you.

338
00:17:54,569 --> 00:17:57,370
You're not supposed
to get the wrong idea like this.

339
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,509
I got the wrong idea?

340
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,249
This is why I asked you to stop...

341
00:18:11,249 --> 00:18:12,920
being so nice to me.

342
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,390
I'm weak in the head,

343
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,890
so I get the wrong idea...

344
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,860
when you're nice to me.

345
00:18:19,489 --> 00:18:21,890
But why were you waiting for me
with umbrellas so late at night?

346
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,670
Why do you keep
stirring my heart like that?

347
00:18:26,569 --> 00:18:30,140
And after stirring my heart
like that, you just deny it.

348
00:18:31,999 --> 00:18:34,339
You're a horrible guy, Director Ko.

349
00:18:37,579 --> 00:18:39,079
You're so mean.

350
00:18:42,249 --> 00:18:43,249
Ji Young.

351
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,420
I guess I was wrong.
I mean... It's all my fault.

352
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,420
I'm really sorry.
It won't happen again.

353
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,289
I will...

354
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:54,930
never come to pick you up
with an umbrella...

355
00:18:55,329 --> 00:18:56,730
or suggest carpooling again.

356
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,329
I won't even ask you to eat with me.

357
00:19:02,739 --> 00:19:05,769
I'm so glad
that it's all cleared up.

358
00:19:08,539 --> 00:19:09,779
You know what?

359
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:13,079
If I ever flirt with you again,

360
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:16,680
I will change my family name
from Kim to Park.

361
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:25,589
Park Do Ra.

362
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,789
Then you tell me.

363
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,130
What am I supposed to do now?

364
00:19:33,829 --> 00:19:35,170
What do you want me to do?

365
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,499
Go ahead and tell me what to do.

366
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,809
When are you going to come back?

367
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,210
When will it be?

368
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:55,220
(Pil Seung)

369
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,259
No.

370
00:20:01,329 --> 00:20:04,130
If I call him out and talk about it
at this time of night,

371
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,870
he will find it strange for sure.

372
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,999
Things have been going well
with Pil Seung so far.

373
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,339
No.

374
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:19,249
I have to stop it from happening
no matter what.

375
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:28,920
That's Pil Seung.

376
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,829
Why is he walking around
in the rain?

377
00:20:41,529 --> 00:20:42,700
Pil Seung.

378
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,370
- Ms. Jang.
- Hey.

379
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,940
Why are you walking around
in the rain?

380
00:20:50,809 --> 00:20:52,349
Did something bad happen?

381
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:56,420
No. I was out for a walk,
and it started raining.

382
00:20:56,849 --> 00:20:59,289
Actually, it feels nice to walk
in the rain after a long time.

383
00:21:00,249 --> 00:21:02,789
What? It feels nice?

384
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:06,259
You might catch a cold.

385
00:21:06,259 --> 00:21:08,059
I'll be fine.
You shouldn't get rained on.

386
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:11,329
By the way, what are you doing here?

387
00:21:12,769 --> 00:21:15,499
I was in the neighborhood
to take care of something,

388
00:21:15,499 --> 00:21:17,900
and I just saw you
walking in the rain.

389
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:21,940
Well... Pil Seung.

390
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,950
I know Ma Ri has been bothering you.

391
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,220
And even my husband
went to see you...

392
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,519
and said some silly things.
I'm so sorry about that.

393
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:35,819
Maybe Ma Ri isn't
good enough for you.

394
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:38,190
I told my husband to stop all that.

395
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,160
No. I'm the one
who should apologize.

396
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,700
But this isn't about Ma Ri.

397
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:48,569
I just can't afford to meet someone
and think of marriage now.

398
00:21:48,569 --> 00:21:50,769
Anyway, I'm sorry.

399
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:54,910
I believe
it would be better for me...

400
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,880
to think of her as a friend
and your daughter.

401
00:21:58,739 --> 00:22:01,650
You don't have to apologize.
I'm the one who should feel sorry.

402
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,150
You don't have to worry about it.
I'm really okay with it.

403
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:06,950
I also hope...

404
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,920
Ma Ri and you will
stay good friends...

405
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,089
like an older brother
and a little sister.

406
00:22:14,529 --> 00:22:17,259
Thank you for saying that.

407
00:22:18,099 --> 00:22:20,269
Please go back home safely
in the rain.

408
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,870
Okay. Wait, Pil Seung.
You should take this.

409
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:27,769
It's okay. I just want
to get rained on after a long time.

410
00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:29,309
Drive safe.

411
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:30,539
No. Wait.

412
00:22:41,972 --> 00:22:44,843
(All For You)

413
00:22:44,843 --> 00:22:46,373
Sun Young, you're here.

414
00:22:46,373 --> 00:22:49,942
Soo Yeon, you're early.

415
00:22:58,992 --> 00:23:00,022
Soo Yeon.

416
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:03,093
I'm so sorry.

417
00:23:03,663 --> 00:23:06,962
Pil Seung wants to focus
on work at the moment.

418
00:23:07,093 --> 00:23:09,302
He's not interested
in seeing someone.

419
00:23:10,702 --> 00:23:14,403
Come on. Why are you being
so serious when we're best friends?

420
00:23:15,242 --> 00:23:16,472
I'm sorry.

421
00:23:17,173 --> 00:23:20,212
Ma Ri already went to your place
and caused you trouble,

422
00:23:20,683 --> 00:23:23,952
and my husband put you
under a lot of pressure with silly words.

423
00:23:24,752 --> 00:23:26,383
If I knew, I would've stopped him.

424
00:23:26,383 --> 00:23:27,952
I had no idea.

425
00:23:28,683 --> 00:23:30,083
I'm really sorry.

426
00:23:30,482 --> 00:23:32,823
Don't say that. I'm sorry.

427
00:23:34,022 --> 00:23:37,123
And I understand Pil Seung is
in a crucial moment of his life.

428
00:23:37,123 --> 00:23:40,133
He needs to focus on work
and build a successful career.

429
00:23:41,202 --> 00:23:43,103
You know this isn't something...

430
00:23:43,103 --> 00:23:45,333
we can force him into
just because we want it.

431
00:23:45,802 --> 00:23:47,002
I can't agree more.

432
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:48,843
And...

433
00:23:49,472 --> 00:23:52,113
I've seen Pil Seung
since he was a little baby.

434
00:23:55,442 --> 00:23:58,552
So I feel like he's my son.

435
00:24:00,923 --> 00:24:03,252
There's only one thing
I want from Pil Seung.

436
00:24:03,823 --> 00:24:06,952
He should get to be happy
with a fine young lady.

437
00:24:08,022 --> 00:24:10,692
I'll be sure
to find someone for him.

438
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:12,633
Soo Yeon, my gosh.

439
00:24:13,692 --> 00:24:16,933
I'm truly grateful
for you saying that.

440
00:24:18,972 --> 00:24:20,333
I had no idea...

441
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,173
how I was going
to turn your husband down.

442
00:24:23,242 --> 00:24:25,913
I was worried
this might ruin our friendship.

443
00:24:28,282 --> 00:24:30,313
What? He's not interested?

444
00:24:31,552 --> 00:24:34,383
He's not interested in dating Ma Ri?

445
00:24:34,623 --> 00:24:36,383
If he had been, he wouldn't have
turned you down in a heartbeat.

446
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,093
He turned me down so easily?

447
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:42,022
I'm afraid so.

448
00:24:43,522 --> 00:24:45,232
But I find this more grateful...

449
00:24:45,732 --> 00:24:47,333
than them giving us false hope.

450
00:24:48,702 --> 00:24:51,302
So don't let Ma Ri
persuade you any further...

451
00:24:51,772 --> 00:24:52,972
and move on from this idea.

452
00:24:53,702 --> 00:24:55,002
If we're patient enough,

453
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:57,972
someone decent
will turn up for Ma Ri.

454
00:25:04,552 --> 00:25:06,252
How am I going
to explain this to her?

455
00:25:08,083 --> 00:25:10,353
She has been genuinely excited.

456
00:25:20,563 --> 00:25:21,603
Gosh.

457
00:25:27,472 --> 00:25:29,702
Even a cow needs a hill
to rub against.

458
00:25:29,702 --> 00:25:31,042
I must have some money
to offer as a signing bonus...

459
00:25:31,042 --> 00:25:32,712
to find a talent to manage.

460
00:25:37,813 --> 00:25:38,813
That's right.

461
00:25:39,653 --> 00:25:42,883
Gong Jin Dan is the reason
my life went down the drain.

462
00:25:43,282 --> 00:25:44,823
If he hadn't cut...

463
00:25:44,823 --> 00:25:47,123
all of Do Ra's advertisement deals,

464
00:25:47,863 --> 00:25:48,923
she wouldn't have died.

465
00:25:49,722 --> 00:25:51,163
I wouldn't be living in a dump.

466
00:26:01,873 --> 00:26:03,873
Come on. Don't do this.

467
00:26:03,942 --> 00:26:05,512
- Let go.
- I see that you're back.

468
00:26:05,573 --> 00:26:06,573
Mr. Gong will bite our heads off,

469
00:26:06,573 --> 00:26:07,643
so let's throw her out
before he finds out.

470
00:26:07,643 --> 00:26:09,113
- Come on.
- Let go of me!

471
00:26:09,113 --> 00:26:10,913
- You're leaving.
- I'm Baek Mi Ja, darn it.

472
00:26:10,913 --> 00:26:12,153
Let go of me.

473
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,782
Mr. Gong!

474
00:26:13,952 --> 00:26:15,683
I have something to say to you.

475
00:26:15,683 --> 00:26:18,052
Give me some of your time.

476
00:26:18,052 --> 00:26:19,423
I have something to say.

477
00:26:19,423 --> 00:26:21,522
Mr. Gong, please.

478
00:26:23,823 --> 00:26:25,933
I apologize for the commotion.

479
00:26:27,633 --> 00:26:29,702
I'm not some crazy woman,

480
00:26:29,702 --> 00:26:33,302
and it wasn't easy for me
to come here of my own accord.

481
00:26:34,542 --> 00:26:35,573
However,

482
00:26:36,802 --> 00:26:39,373
you were the only person
I could turn to.

483
00:26:44,512 --> 00:26:47,722
After Do Ra died,

484
00:26:48,883 --> 00:26:50,653
I lost everything.

485
00:26:51,093 --> 00:26:54,722
Money, the house, people,
and everything.

486
00:26:55,722 --> 00:26:57,863
But since I had to live,

487
00:26:58,163 --> 00:27:00,433
I sold gimbap in subway stations...

488
00:27:00,792 --> 00:27:03,333
and even washed dishes
at restaurants.

489
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:07,302
I did all that I could
just to make ends meet.

490
00:27:15,012 --> 00:27:16,313
You should know...

491
00:27:17,413 --> 00:27:19,552
that I was extremely fond of you.

492
00:27:20,212 --> 00:27:22,722
I wanted you as my son-in-law.

493
00:27:23,883 --> 00:27:26,353
Mr. Gong, above everything else,

494
00:27:27,323 --> 00:27:28,762
please think of Do Ra...

495
00:27:29,893 --> 00:27:32,032
and help me out this once.

496
00:27:33,163 --> 00:27:36,532
If you help me, I will never...

497
00:27:36,732 --> 00:27:39,903
I will never
come to your office again.

498
00:27:40,732 --> 00:27:42,702
Who are we to each other anyway,

499
00:27:43,542 --> 00:27:45,343
that has you
telling me your sob story?

500
00:27:53,313 --> 00:27:54,353
(Cashier's Check)

501
00:27:54,353 --> 00:27:55,383
What?

502
00:27:56,222 --> 00:27:57,853
If you were going to pay me,

503
00:27:57,853 --> 00:27:59,752
why not make it 100,000
instead of 50,000 dollars?

504
00:28:00,593 --> 00:28:03,563
I see you're not the hotshot
you used to be.

505
00:28:05,863 --> 00:28:08,863
No, I should be grateful for this.

506
00:28:09,903 --> 00:28:12,833
With this,
I will get back on my feet.

507
00:28:13,232 --> 00:28:16,373
That's right. I will start anew!

508
00:28:20,272 --> 00:28:21,282
Gosh, that's hot.

509
00:28:28,722 --> 00:28:30,482
Do Sik.

510
00:28:34,992 --> 00:28:37,063
Mom, what are those shopper bags?

511
00:28:37,962 --> 00:28:39,333
Did you charge them
on my credit card again?

512
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:40,792
You promised not to do this.

513
00:28:40,792 --> 00:28:42,002
I didn't spend your money.

514
00:28:42,002 --> 00:28:44,063
I don't always go around
causing trouble.

515
00:28:44,232 --> 00:28:46,373
Where did you get the money
to buy these?

516
00:28:46,732 --> 00:28:49,643
Someone made an investment.

517
00:28:50,542 --> 00:28:51,542
Who would trust you
and make an investment?

518
00:28:51,542 --> 00:28:52,742
Stop talking nonsense.

519
00:28:52,742 --> 00:28:53,843
It's true.

520
00:28:54,413 --> 00:28:56,242
I'm going to start...

521
00:28:56,482 --> 00:28:58,683
a new talent agency.

522
00:28:58,913 --> 00:29:02,323
I have the expertise that I used
to make Do Ra a top celebrity.

523
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:05,323
I will have another
be the next Park Do Ra.

524
00:29:05,323 --> 00:29:06,552
You wait and see.

525
00:29:07,393 --> 00:29:10,323
Sure. How much was this investment?

526
00:29:10,492 --> 00:29:12,032
It wasn't much. Just 50,000 dollars.

527
00:29:12,532 --> 00:29:13,593
Did you say 50,000?

528
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:17,002
Are you sure the money's clean?

529
00:29:17,302 --> 00:29:19,502
Of course, it is!
Have you only been duped in your life?

530
00:29:19,573 --> 00:29:21,903
The money is clean, so don't worry.

531
00:29:23,843 --> 00:29:25,913
But 50,000 dollars isn't enough.

532
00:29:25,913 --> 00:29:28,042
It'll cost more these days
to produce new talent.

533
00:29:28,313 --> 00:29:30,113
You should know...

534
00:29:30,113 --> 00:29:32,353
that even when
I had next to no money,

535
00:29:32,512 --> 00:29:34,952
I made Do Ra into the top celebrity
that she was.

536
00:29:34,952 --> 00:29:36,823
Compared to that,
I'm already ahead of the game.

537
00:29:36,823 --> 00:29:37,952
I know I can do this.

538
00:29:38,952 --> 00:29:41,393
Do Sik, believe in me...

539
00:29:41,663 --> 00:29:43,063
and be patient.

540
00:29:43,192 --> 00:29:44,663
When I get back on my feet,

541
00:29:44,663 --> 00:29:47,433
you'll work with me again. Okay?

542
00:29:47,433 --> 00:29:48,702
Cook me some ramyeon.

543

I need to eat and find
an actor for my agency,

544
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:52,472
so get cooking.

545
00:29:54,742 --> 00:29:55,802
Fine.

546
00:29:56,802 --> 00:29:57,873
Darn.

Gosh.

549

No one seems to have the talent.

550
00:30:11,052 --> 00:30:12,252
I didn't get a call back
this time around either.

551
00:30:13,222 --> 00:30:14,823
Darn.

552
00:30:16,222 --> 00:30:17,933
Excuse me. Are you...

553
00:30:19,133 --> 00:30:20,462
an aspiring actress?

554
00:30:21,232 --> 00:30:23,133
Yes. Do I know you?

555
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:24,873
Oh, right. I'm...

556
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:28,603
I'm CEO Baek Mi Ja
from Baek Entertainment.

557
00:30:28,603 --> 00:30:29,643

(CEO Baek Mi Ja)

559
00:30:36,913 --> 00:30:40,413
Dad, was I rejected?

560
00:30:42,752 --> 00:30:44,722
It's not because he dislikes you.

561
00:30:44,722 --> 00:30:46,222
Emotionally,
you're in different places.

562
00:30:47,593 --> 00:30:51,022
So now, it's about time
you moved on from Pil Seung.

563
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:53,192
Don't consider him that way.

564
00:30:53,663 --> 00:30:55,103
Give up on the idea.

565
00:30:55,403 --> 00:30:59,073
But Dad, Pil Seung
doesn't even have a girlfriend.

566
00:30:59,133 --> 00:31:00,573
So why are you telling me
to give up?

567
00:31:01,643 --> 00:31:03,042
We have a lot of money,

568
00:31:03,042 --> 00:31:06,113
so say you'll give him everything
including what the company has.

569
00:31:06,313 --> 00:31:07,413
That'll solve everything.

570

Even though I pleaded with you,

576
00:31:30,163 --> 00:31:31,302
you weren't interested.

That's how one's heart is.

579
00:31:41,542 --> 00:31:43,613
will not get the other person
to like you.

580
00:31:49,423 --> 00:31:50,452
All right.

581
00:31:51,893 --> 00:31:54,123
I get what you're saying,

582
00:31:54,623 --> 00:31:55,722
so leave me be.

583
00:31:56,292 --> 00:31:57,522

- Good job.

I heard Cha Bong Soo and Bi Bi
fought and broke up.

00:32:26,552 --> 00:32:27,722
The rumor must be true.

590
00:32:28,462 --> 00:32:30,863
They were shooting lasers
from their eyes in that last scene.

591
00:32:31,492 --> 00:32:34,063
It's a relief
that filming is almost over.

592
00:32:34,502 --> 00:32:36,163
If not, it would've
ruined the dynamic.

Ji Young, can you get the props
from Room 1006?

594
00:32:43,802 --> 00:32:44,873
Sure.

No!

I...

605
00:34:08,022 --> 00:34:10,363
I want to get out of here.

606
00:34:11,762 --> 00:34:14,462
Please take me home.

607
00:34:16,363 --> 00:34:18,333
I'm too scared.

608
00:34:21,072 --> 00:34:24,842
Someone was trying to take me away.

609
00:34:27,313 --> 00:34:29,043
But the room's empty.

- All right.
- Ji Young?

00:34:31,713 --> 00:34:33,213
It's all right. I'll take you home.

00:34:41,592 --> 00:34:44,563
Ji Young, are you sure
you don't need a doctor?

614

615
00:34:51,063 --> 00:34:53,072
Please take me home.

616
00:34:55,603 --> 00:34:56,643
All right.

00:35:02,483 --> 00:35:03,483
Thank you.

620
00:35:18,963 --> 00:35:20,492
I don't know.

621
00:35:21,362 --> 00:35:24,672
I can't stop crying.

622
00:35:28,943 --> 00:35:32,213
My head's killing me,

623
00:35:33,842 --> 00:35:35,782
and I'm terrified.

624
00:35:36,782 --> 00:35:37,842
What do we do?

625
00:35:41,282 --> 00:35:43,552
This won't do.
Let's go see a doctor.

626
00:35:43,552 --> 00:35:45,793
It's late, so let's at least
go to the ER.

627
00:35:45,793 --> 00:35:47,293
Ji Young, come on.

628
00:35:47,722 --> 00:35:51,222
No, I don't want to see a doctor.

629
00:35:51,893 --> 00:35:55,433
I don't want to go anywhere else.

630
00:35:56,503 --> 00:35:58,672
I'd rather stay here.

631
00:36:01,103 --> 00:36:03,503
All right.
I'll at least get you some medicine.

632
00:36:05,242 --> 00:36:08,813
Director Ko,
she's burning up like crazy.

633
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:10,612
Got it.

634
00:36:24,463 --> 00:36:26,532
Something must've shocked her
out of the blue,

635
00:36:26,532 --> 00:36:28,463
but she's complaining of a headache
and is terrified.

636
00:36:28,802 --> 00:36:30,362
She was caught
in the rain yesterday,

637
00:36:30,362 --> 00:36:32,003
so she's running a fever as well.

638
00:36:32,302 --> 00:36:33,472
Just a second.

639
00:36:43,313 --> 00:36:44,543

That's right.

642
00:37:02,003 --> 00:37:03,103
It's that hotel.

643
00:37:04,032 --> 00:37:05,233
It was the same hotel.

644
00:37:06,873 --> 00:37:09,242
I can't believe I forgot about it.

645
00:37:10,503 --> 00:37:12,672
Why did I film the scene there?

646
00:37:20,882 --> 00:37:22,922
She fell asleep
after crying her eyes out.

647
00:37:24,793 --> 00:37:26,152
Did she say anything else?

648
00:37:26,152 --> 00:37:27,293
Why did she suddenly
have a panic attack?

649
00:37:28,262 --> 00:37:30,123
She saw something odd at the hotel.

650
00:37:30,362 --> 00:37:32,532
A dark figure
kept dragging her toward him.

651
00:37:33,563 --> 00:37:35,063
That must've caused the shock.

652
00:37:36,103 --> 00:37:37,802
Is that place haunted or something?

653
00:37:39,603 --> 00:37:42,842
Could Ji Young have
some sort of unresolved trauma?

654
00:37:45,342 --> 00:37:46,342
A trauma?

655
00:37:47,672 --> 00:37:49,183
Should I wake her up?

656
00:37:49,443 --> 00:37:51,213
She should probably
take her medicine.

657
00:37:51,952 --> 00:37:54,313
Don't. Sleeping it off
might help her more.

658
00:37:54,552 --> 00:37:56,052
She can take her medicine
after waking up.

659
00:37:56,583 --> 00:37:57,583
Sure.

660
00:38:03,422 --> 00:38:04,422
Hello?

661
00:38:05,293 --> 00:38:06,333
Yes.

662
00:38:07,132 --> 00:38:08,802
I'm sorry about that.
I'll be right there.

663
00:38:11,103 --> 00:38:12,433
Director, I'm sorry,

664
00:38:12,433 --> 00:38:14,032
but I need to be back on set.

665
00:38:14,532 --> 00:38:16,543
We weren't able to wrap up properly
after filming at the hotel.

666
00:38:16,672 --> 00:38:17,873
Bills have to be paid as well.

667
00:38:18,472 --> 00:38:19,773
Sure, get going.

668
00:38:19,773 --> 00:38:20,913
Call me if anything happens.

669
00:38:20,913 --> 00:38:21,943
Got it.

670
00:38:44,262 --> 00:38:45,472
What do you think?

671
00:38:46,733 --> 00:38:47,802
She's not bad.

672
00:38:48,902 --> 00:38:51,572
She's pretty.
She reminds me of Do Ra...

673
00:38:55,543 --> 00:38:57,313
She's a lot like Do Ra
when she was young.

674
00:38:57,313 --> 00:38:59,282
I like her fresh look.

675
00:39:00,612 --> 00:39:01,623
Right?

676
00:39:02,052 --> 00:39:04,322
She's at the perfect age as well
which is 23.

677
00:39:04,322 --> 00:39:06,092
She's a college senior
studying theater.

678
00:39:06,092 --> 00:39:07,322
Will she sign with you?

679
00:39:07,322 --> 00:39:09,592
Yes, I said I made Do Ra
into a top celebrity...

680
00:39:09,592 --> 00:39:12,132
and that I'd do anything
to get her attention.

681
00:39:12,132 --> 00:39:13,933
She jumped at the chance.

682
00:39:13,933 --> 00:39:15,262
We even decided on a new name.

683
00:39:15,262 --> 00:39:16,333
Which is?

684
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:17,603
Do Do.

685
00:39:17,902 --> 00:39:21,702
I will have her become
the next Park Do Ra.

686
00:39:27,572 --> 00:39:28,643
I will...

687
00:39:30,012 --> 00:39:32,353
avenge Do Ra's soul...

688
00:39:33,612 --> 00:39:35,152
and let her rest in peace.

689
00:39:36,152 --> 00:39:37,222
I'll do what it takes.

690
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:42,761
- You're horrible.
- How could you?

691
00:39:42,761 --> 00:39:44,661
- I hate you.
- You're the worst.

692
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,569
Ji Young, what's wrong?

693
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:11,909
Director Ko.

694
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,580
Director Ko, I'm scared.

695
00:40:15,339 --> 00:40:17,609
I'm so scared.

696
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,020
Ji Young, it's all right.

697
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:24,190
I'm here for you, so don't worry.

698
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:26,719
Was it a bad dream?

699
00:40:28,089 --> 00:40:29,259
I don't know.

700
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:32,630
I don't know if this was a bad dream
or one of my lost memories.

701
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:36,500
Director Ko, I think...

702
00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:41,900
something must've happened to me
at that hotel.

703
00:40:43,299 --> 00:40:44,810
The memory is too real,

704
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:47,279
and it's terrifying
at the same time.

705
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:00,089
Ji Young.

706
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,960
Ji Young.

707
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:05,190
Look at me.

708
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:08,900
Nothing...

709
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,330
happened to you.

710
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:13,699
It was only...

711
00:41:14,299 --> 00:41:16,040
a bad dream.

712
00:41:17,109 --> 00:41:18,170
It's all right.

713
00:41:22,509 --> 00:41:23,509
Director Ko...

714
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,819
I don't think
I should regain my memories.

715
00:41:30,549 --> 00:41:32,290
I must've done something...

716
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,790
really bad in the past.

717
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:39,460
I see people chasing after me,

718
00:41:39,489 --> 00:41:42,199
pointing their fingers at me,
and cussing me out.

719
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,799
They hit me...

720
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:46,900
and threw eggs at me as well.

721
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:51,770
While running away from them,

722
00:41:52,609 --> 00:41:54,480
I fell into the water.

723
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,210
Those memories...

724
00:41:57,609 --> 00:42:00,920
seem too real
to just be a bad dream.

725
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,949
Director Ko,

726
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:08,120
could this be one of the memories
that I lost?

727
00:42:13,929 --> 00:42:16,630
I don't want to regain
my memories anymore.

728
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:21,000
I'll keep living as I am
without remembering my past.

729
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:24,469
I'd be glad
if this was just a bad dream,

730
00:42:24,469 --> 00:42:27,940
but if it's one
of the memories I lost,

731
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:32,279
I don't want to remember it
ever again.

732
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,449
Never again.

733
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:40,319
I don't want that to be a memory.

734
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:53,170
Ji Young.

735
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,600
It was a bad dream.

736
00:42:57,339 --> 00:42:59,310
You've been exhausted lately,

737
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,710
and that was a result of it.

738
00:43:04,409 --> 00:43:05,650
It happens to me sometimes.

739
00:43:06,049 --> 00:43:07,080
So...

740
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,150
don't worry.

741
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:54,130
I caught long-legged octopi,
of course.

742
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:56,060
To sell tomorrow.

743
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,670
Let's move to the next site!

744
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,040
(Filming in progress: "Don't Lie")

745
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:04,339
We live in a world
that's beautiful...

746
00:44:04,339 --> 00:44:08,639
and worth living in.
That's what I thought.

747
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:11,409
I'll keep living as I am
without remembering my past.

748
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:18,850
Yes, Do Ra.

749
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:21,589
Live as Kim Ji Young.

750
00:44:23,319 --> 00:44:25,259
Don't go back into that torment.

751
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:27,799
Let's...

752
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,529
live as we are now, Do Ra.

753
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:40,779
That was nice and refreshing.

754
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,580
It's best to go to a public bath
at the crack of dawn.

755
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,009
Yes. It's quiet...

756
00:44:45,009 --> 00:44:46,210
- and clean.
- Yes.

757
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,150
- Do you want banana milk?
- That's why we came here.

758
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:52,250
Did you two just get back
from the bathhouse?

759
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:53,290
Yes.

760
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:56,460
Hey. I want to ask you something.

761
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:59,029
Is Pil Seung dating...

762
00:44:59,589 --> 00:45:01,429
your tenant?

763
00:45:01,659 --> 00:45:02,659
What?

764
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:05,500
What are you talking about?

765
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:06,770
Come on.

766
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:09,500
Why would you say something
that nasty so early in the day?

767
00:45:09,799 --> 00:45:12,009
Don't you dare associate
our Pil Seung with her.

768
00:45:12,069 --> 00:45:13,370
But...

769
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:16,909
But he gives her a ride
in the morning and evening.

770
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,380
What? He drives her?

771
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,620
- Our Pil Seung?
- Yes.

772
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:22,719
What?

773
00:45:23,049 --> 00:45:25,850
They work at the same place.

774
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:27,819
I'm sure it was just a few times.

775
00:45:28,089 --> 00:45:29,089
Really?

776
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:32,529
It wasn't just a few times.
He drove her every day.

777
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,259
I thought they were dating.

778
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:36,429
Never mind, then.

779
00:45:37,429 --> 00:45:38,429
What the...

780
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,440
Hey.

781
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,569
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

782
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,339
I don't believe it.

783
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,239
What's wrong with that woman?

784
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:47,739
Sun Young,
you should talk to Pil Seung.

785
00:45:47,909 --> 00:45:50,710
Why would he drive her every day?

786
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,210
Tell him not to drive her again.
That people notice.

787
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:55,620
Why would he
give her a ride every day?

788
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:58,489
I bet she made a fuss
about something she saw just once.

789
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,549
She's weird.

790
00:46:06,589 --> 00:46:07,630
Goodness.

791
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:09,560
That... Who's that?

792
00:46:13,429 --> 00:46:15,000
What did I just see?

793
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,009
Was that our Pil Seung?

794
00:46:18,069 --> 00:46:19,069
But...

795
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:22,339
Why is Pil Seung
coming from her unit...

796
00:46:22,339 --> 00:46:23,710
at this early hour?

797
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:27,819
Did he spend the night with her?

798
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:31,120
When did the two get that close?

799
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:34,389
Mother.
Why would you say it like that?

800
00:46:35,319 --> 00:46:38,290
It can't be like that.
I'm sure he just asked a question.

801
00:46:39,089 --> 00:46:41,159
What would he ask
this early in the morning?

802
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:44,699
Mother. I need to go inside.

803
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:47,440
Hang on.

804
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:50,199
Is this why he said...

805
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:53,139
he wasn't interested in Ma Ri?

806
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:57,210
How dare he...

807
00:47:00,549 --> 00:47:01,549
My gosh.

808
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,679
Mom. Knock, please.

809
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,150
Ko Pil Seung.

810
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:07,120
I saw you...

811
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:09,790
leave the tenant's room just now.

812
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:11,359
What's going on?

813
00:47:12,389 --> 00:47:14,400
Why did you leave her unit
at this time of day?

814
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:18,699
Ji Young was very ill.

815
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:21,239
I got her medicine
and looked after her all night.

816
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,639
What?

817
00:47:24,009 --> 00:47:26,040
She fainted on set yesterday.

818
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:27,839
I couldn't ignore her
when I was in charge.

819
00:47:28,279 --> 00:47:30,179
She suffered from a fever all night.

820
00:47:30,549 --> 00:47:32,380
I made her porridge too.

821
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:34,819
Then...

822
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:37,920
you spent the whole night there?

823
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:39,850
Alone with her?

824
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:44,429
Mom. Why would you put it like that?

825
00:47:44,489 --> 00:47:45,989
I just explained.

826
00:47:46,529 --> 00:47:48,230
If she were unwell,

827
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,500
you should've told me or your aunt.

828
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,170
Why would you stay the night?

829
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:53,670
What if someone saw you?

830
00:47:55,299 --> 00:47:59,339
And what if she starts to think
you're being weird?

831
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,109
You fool.

832
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:05,210
How dare you go into a room
a woman lives in...

833
00:48:05,509 --> 00:48:07,949
on her own
knowing the world we live in?

834
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,690
What are you thinking we did?

835
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:13,389
It's not like that.
Don't get the wrong idea.

836
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:15,659
Are you sure?

837
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,330
There's nothing between you and her?

838
00:48:19,759 --> 00:48:21,859
There's nothing between us at all.

839
00:48:23,029 --> 00:48:24,199
Do you mean that?

840
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:26,100
Yes.

841
00:48:26,969 --> 00:48:29,670
Then why do you drive her
to and from work every day?

842
00:48:31,139 --> 00:48:32,139
What?

843
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:33,940
People are even asking me...

844
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:36,139
if you're dating her.

845
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,520
Why would you give her rides
to and from work?

846
00:48:41,179 --> 00:48:43,989
Mom. She works with me,

847
00:48:43,989 --> 00:48:45,250
and we both live here.

848
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:47,460
It would be weird
to drive off on my own.

849
00:48:48,589 --> 00:48:50,120
That's why I give her a ride.

850
00:48:51,029 --> 00:48:52,690
- I'm off to work.
- From now on,

851
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:54,659
don't give her a ride.
Don't drive her.

852
00:48:54,659 --> 00:48:56,529
- People will think...
- Hey.

853
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,230
Did you see that?

854
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:00,770
He walked off without answering.

855
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:03,339
What on earth is going on?

856
00:49:04,109 --> 00:49:06,210
Sun Young. This is serious.

857
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:07,909
It could get bad...

858
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:10,040
if you don't do anything.

859
00:49:11,779 --> 00:49:12,779
My gosh.

860
00:49:13,109 --> 00:49:15,250
Sun Young. Hey.

861
00:49:16,779 --> 00:49:19,420
Sun Young.

862
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:22,560
You need to reel in Pil Seung.

863
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,730
This is no small matter.

864
00:49:25,859 --> 00:49:28,900
He visited a woman
who lives alone early in the day.

865
00:49:29,159 --> 00:49:31,000
My gosh.

866
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,830
I didn't take her seriously
because she was from the country,

867
00:49:34,069 --> 00:49:35,799
but she must be a sly one.

868
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:39,009
They say the quiet ones
get into trouble first.

869
00:49:39,469 --> 00:49:42,009
Sun Young.
If you don't do something,

870
00:49:42,139 --> 00:49:44,350
we might end up
with a bigger problem.

871
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:47,580
You need to heed my warning.

872
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:50,279
My gosh.

873
00:50:03,859 --> 00:50:04,900
Goodness.

874
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,210
Oh, no. This is bad.

875
00:50:14,409 --> 00:50:15,980
It's 10 a.m. already?

876
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,679
I'm late for work.

877
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:22,420
Hang on.

878
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,659
Ji Young. Take the day off.

879
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,190
I set it up for you.

880
00:50:30,989 --> 00:50:33,230
We'll be in the office
since we don't film today,

881
00:50:33,529 --> 00:50:35,299
and there's nothing for you
to do anyway.

882
00:50:35,529 --> 00:50:37,029
Rest up without worries.

883
00:50:37,969 --> 00:50:39,270
I made some porridge.

884
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:41,239
Heat it up for breakfast,

885
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,139
and be sure to take the medicine.

886
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,880
Why does Director Ko do things...

887
00:50:50,109 --> 00:50:51,850
that touch my heart?

888
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:55,219
No, Kim Ji Young.

889
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,850
You vowed not to do this.

890
00:50:58,190 --> 00:51:01,420
Even if you like him,
you must keep it in now.

891
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:07,600
But it would only be right
to send a thank-you text.

892
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,310
Who could that be?

893
00:51:21,339 --> 00:51:22,580
Who is it?

894
00:51:23,409 --> 00:51:24,580
Ji Young. It's me.

895
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:27,250
It's the landlady Ms. Kim.

896
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,520
Oh, gosh.

897
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,150
Hello.

898
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:34,889
What brings you here?

899
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,330
We need to talk.

900
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:49,670
I don't want to say such things.

901
00:51:51,009 --> 00:51:52,109
Ji Young.

902
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:56,509
Why do you let Pil Seung drive you
every morning and evening?

903
00:51:57,909 --> 00:51:58,909
Pardon?

904
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:00,819
That's because...

905
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:03,719
he suggested we carpool
so I could...

906
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:05,719
save on public transportation.

907
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,560
He could say such a thing.

908
00:52:08,989 --> 00:52:10,730
But you should've refused.

909
00:52:11,389 --> 00:52:12,830
How could you...

910
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:14,900
hop into his car
just because he invited you to?

911
00:52:16,429 --> 00:52:18,529
You're both young and single.

912
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,400
You should be careful.

913
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:23,270
We lived here for a long time.

914
00:52:23,799 --> 00:52:26,940
The whole neighborhood
knows us and Pil Seung.

915
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:31,710
Then there's last night too.

916
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:34,650
You could've told us
if you were unwell.

917
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:37,650
Pil Seung said he stayed here
all night to look after you.

918
00:52:38,219 --> 00:52:40,290
Even if he offered to do that,

919
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:42,889
you should've refused
and said you were okay.

920
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,060
What would others think
if they saw you?

921
00:52:46,489 --> 00:52:47,630
I apologize.

922
00:52:48,359 --> 00:52:51,630
I didn't know
Director Ko was here all night.

923
00:52:51,799 --> 00:52:53,929
I thought he'd dropped off
the medicine and left.

924
00:52:55,469 --> 00:52:58,409
Anyway, I'd like you
to be careful from now on.

925
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:00,569
People here tend to gossip.

926
00:53:01,779 --> 00:53:04,850
Yes, ma'am. I'll be careful.

927
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:11,750
Ji Young.

928
00:53:12,549 --> 00:53:14,290
There's a wealthy family...

929
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:16,989
that wants our Pil Seung
to be their son-in-law.

930
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:20,429
Thanks to him, you got a job...

931
00:53:20,429 --> 00:53:23,100
and found a place to rent
at an affordable price.

932
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:25,429
You can't be doing this.

933
00:53:27,469 --> 00:53:28,540
I'm sorry.

934
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:32,440
Pil Seung says there's nothing
going on between you two.

935
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,009
Are you sure that's true?

936
00:53:37,239 --> 00:53:39,679
Yes. There's nothing going on.

937
00:53:40,949 --> 00:53:44,319
Fine. I will take you at your word.

938
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,500
Right.

939
00:54:05,339 --> 00:54:06,710
I was being a fool.

940
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,009
She's right about that.

941
00:54:12,049 --> 00:54:14,250
I was after someone
who was out of my league...

942
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:17,690
and ended up hurting myself.

943
00:54:21,719 --> 00:54:23,659
I should stop it now.

944
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:27,389
I have to.

945
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:33,799
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

946
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:42,940
Let's go.

947
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:56,790
Seriously, what's wrong with me?

948
00:54:57,929 --> 00:55:00,429
Whenever I see Ji Young,
I'm reminded of Do Ra.

949
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:04,600
And when I think of Do Ra,
I'm reminded of Ji Young.

950
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:06,929
Why do I keep thinking of those two?

951
00:55:08,569 --> 00:55:10,100
I don't know what's going on.

952
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:14,540
This won't do.

953
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,909
I should see her again.

954
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:21,080
Ji Young, let's have
our second meal today.

955
00:55:44,199 --> 00:55:47,009
Ji Young, let's have
dinner together tonight.

956
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,639
I have something to tell you.

957
00:55:51,049 --> 00:55:53,279
(Ms. Kim Ji Young)

958
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:05,130
She checked my message.

959
00:56:06,589 --> 00:56:07,759
Why isn't she texting me back?

960
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:11,170
Is she still sick?

961
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:23,880
Ji Young.

962
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:28,650
Ji Young.

963
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:34,690
Where did she go
when she was feeling unwell?

964
00:56:38,889 --> 00:56:39,989
She hasn't texted me back.

965
00:56:41,759 --> 00:56:42,960
Is something wrong?

966
00:56:49,469 --> 00:56:51,370
She looks different
when she's haggard.

967
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:53,609
She seems to have an air of calm.

968
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:55,710
What's with her deal?

969
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:57,540
She has a variety of charms.

970
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,219
What's wrong?

971
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:07,049
It's nothing.

972
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:10,759
By the way, Ji Young,
did something happen?

973
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:13,290
You don't seem to be feeling well.

974
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,900
No. I'm fine.

975
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,400
You enjoyed the webfoot octopus
a lot the other day.

976
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:21,339
Do you not like sushi?

977
00:57:21,339 --> 00:57:24,440
It's not like that. I love sushi.

978
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:26,009
Okay. I'm glad to hear that.

979
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:37,719
My goodness.

980
00:57:37,719 --> 00:57:39,690
Why? What's wrong?

981
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,960
Gosh. This is...

982
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,859
I didn't know what this was, so...

983
00:57:45,859 --> 00:57:47,699
Here. Have some water.

984
00:57:47,699 --> 00:57:48,699
Gosh.

985
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:55,969
My gosh. I had no idea
it would be so strong.

986
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,639
You should be careful, Mr. Gong.

987
00:57:58,639 --> 00:58:01,580
It has horseradish in it.
Why did you dip it?

988
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:03,239
My gosh.

989
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:09,279
She's completely different.

990
00:58:10,449 --> 00:58:12,520
But why does she look like Do Ra?

991
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:22,460
Ji Young.

992
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:27,199
What are you doing here?

993
00:58:28,339 --> 00:58:29,670
I was worried.

994
00:58:30,069 --> 00:58:32,009
You were sick,
and I couldn't reach you.

995
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:35,409
Where have you been?

996
00:58:36,509 --> 00:58:38,009
I had dinner plans.

997
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:48,620
This is for you.

998
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:59,969
Why would I get flowers from you?

999
00:59:00,299 --> 00:59:03,199
I told you not to do this.

1000
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:05,270
Ji Young.

1001
00:59:06,139 --> 00:59:09,040
I know you've been upset
and frustrated because of me.

1002
00:59:09,909 --> 00:59:11,080
I'm sorry.

1003
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:15,679
I had my reasons
that I couldn't tell you.

1004
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:19,790
But I decided to stop
over-complicating things.

1005
00:59:21,659 --> 00:59:22,690
Ji Young.

1006
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:25,889
Actually, I have feelings for you.

1007
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:31,299
I see.

1008
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:34,069
Is that so?

1009
00:59:35,199 --> 00:59:37,670
You're so full of yourself,
Director Ko.

1010
00:59:38,139 --> 00:59:41,339
You pushed me away one day,
and you asked me out the next.

1011
00:59:41,339 --> 00:59:43,009
Good for you.

1012
00:59:43,009 --> 00:59:45,080
You always get your own way.

1013
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:49,150
But I'm not interested
in you anymore.

1014
00:59:49,779 --> 00:59:51,790
So I can't accept these flowers.

1015
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:52,790
Wait.

1016
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:55,190
You said you liked me
only a few days ago.

1017
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:57,620
Why the sudden change of heart?

1018
00:59:57,620 --> 01:00:01,330
You also said you didn't like me,
and you just changed your words.

1019
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:04,259
It's not like you're the only one
I should have feelings for.

1020
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:07,770
I liked you,
but I don't feel that way anymore.

1021
01:00:08,469 --> 01:00:11,540
Do I have to back off
when you reject me...

1022
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:13,839
and come right back to you
when you like me?

1023
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:17,880
But that's not what I meant.

1024
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,679
I'll make myself clear.

1025
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:23,779
I'm not interested
in a man like you.

1026
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:28,060
I hate guys who first say one thing
and then the opposite.

1027
01:00:28,359 --> 01:00:31,190
And I hate fickle guys like you.

1028
01:00:31,389 --> 01:00:33,960
I just can't believe what you say.

1029
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:36,029
You say you like me today,

1030
01:00:36,029 --> 01:00:37,299
but you will probably
take it back tomorrow...

1031
01:00:37,299 --> 01:00:38,799
saying you have your own reason.

1032
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:43,639
Anyway, I should get going.

1033
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:48,139
Still, take these flowers.

1034
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:49,509
Forget it.

1035
01:00:53,779 --> 01:00:56,150
This is the personal information
of Ms. Kim Ji Young you asked for.

1036
01:00:56,150 --> 01:00:57,920
Okay. Thank you.

1037
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:02,259
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

1038
01:01:04,830 --> 01:01:06,389
Name, Kim Ji Young.

1039
01:01:06,389 --> 01:01:07,730
Age, 28 years old.

1040
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:10,960
She's one year younger than Do Ra.

1041
01:01:13,029 --> 01:01:15,540
Her parents died in an accident.

1042
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:17,600
So she has only her grandmother
in the family.

1043
01:01:18,609 --> 01:01:20,339
She went to school
in Chungcheong Province.

1044
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,609
But why am I reminded of Do Ra...

1045
01:01:25,609 --> 01:01:27,109
whenever I see her?

1046
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:29,980
They have no connection whatsoever.

1047
01:01:33,319 --> 01:01:34,389
Anyway,

1048
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:37,460
when I'm with Ji Young,

1049
01:01:38,359 --> 01:01:41,230
my heart flutters
as if I'm with Do Ra.

1050
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,230
Maybe that's why
I'm being like this.

1051
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:47,370
I want to keep seeing her.

1052
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:53,810
Ji Young.

1053
01:01:54,739 --> 01:01:55,980
My goodness.

1054
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:00,210
- You're here.
- Yes.

1055
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:02,449
You startled me.

1056
01:02:02,449 --> 01:02:03,449
Let's go.

1057
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:07,350
By the way, Mr. Gong,

1058
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:09,589
do you want to eat
at a department-store restaurant today?

1059
01:02:09,989 --> 01:02:11,159
Just come with me.

1060
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:27,239
Would you like to try holding this?

1061
01:02:27,239 --> 01:02:28,239
Okay.

1062
01:02:31,509 --> 01:02:34,549
She looks more like Do Ra
when she's all dressed up.

1063
01:02:35,219 --> 01:02:37,279
It's not bad. I'll take it.

1064
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,520
Yes, sir.

1065
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:40,589
And...

1066
01:02:40,949 --> 01:02:41,989
That one.

1067
01:02:42,359 --> 01:02:43,520
Let her try it on.

1068
01:02:43,819 --> 01:02:45,989
What? Again, Mr. Gong?

1069
01:02:45,989 --> 01:02:48,600
Gosh, no. That's enough.

1070
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:49,960
I can't do this anymore.

1071
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:53,199
I feel like I'll pass out.

1072
01:02:55,969 --> 01:02:58,009
Okay. I'm sorry.

1073
01:02:58,310 --> 01:03:00,069
This is it for today.

1074
01:03:00,069 --> 01:03:02,710
All right. Please take this.

1075
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:06,650
Gosh, my feet are killing me. Here.

1076
01:03:08,719 --> 01:03:11,020
You asked me
to try on some clothes...

1077
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,449
so that you could buy them
for someone.

1078
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:16,089
That's why I put
on the clothes and shoes...

1079
01:03:16,089 --> 01:03:17,589
and even held purses for you.

1080
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:21,130
But now you're saying
these are all for me.

1081
01:03:21,659 --> 01:03:22,659
That's right.

1082
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:26,370
I knew you'd decline
if I said they were for you,

1083
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:28,739
so I lied.

1084
01:03:30,770 --> 01:03:34,540
Still, I can't accept gifts
of this magnitude.

1085
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:39,049
My grandma said
nothing in this world is for free.

1086
01:03:39,109 --> 01:03:42,080
Liking freebies is how you go bald.

1087
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:44,279
What? Going bald?

1088
01:03:48,989 --> 01:03:52,190
Come on. How is that funny?

1089
01:03:52,259 --> 01:03:53,330
It's not that.

1090
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:56,460
Talking to you
always makes me laugh.

1091
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:58,100
I never heard the saying...

1092
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:00,370
"Liking freebies
is how you go bald."

1093
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:05,639
- Hello.
- Hello.

1094
01:04:05,639 --> 01:04:07,370
You're here two days in a row.

1095
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:09,509
Right. Can I have a bouquet
that's double the size...

1096
01:04:09,609 --> 01:04:11,210
of the one I got yesterday?

1097
01:04:11,679 --> 01:04:12,810
Sure thing.

1098
01:04:33,730 --> 01:04:36,670
Gosh. Please don't.

1099
01:04:36,739 --> 01:04:39,009
I can't accept such expensive gifts.

1100
01:04:39,069 --> 01:04:40,969
I told you not to be burdened.

1101
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:43,609
You won't go bald
from accepting these.

1102
01:04:44,609 --> 01:04:47,380
I should be the one
buying you a suit,

1103
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:48,420
but you're treating me instead.

1104
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:50,719
The calculations are now way off.

1105
01:04:51,989 --> 01:04:54,449
Why are you being this way?

1106
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:56,420
It's because I like you.

1107
01:04:57,690 --> 01:04:58,690
Sorry?

1108
01:04:59,589 --> 01:05:02,500
Ji Young, go out with me.

1109
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:05,900
What?

1110
01:05:14,739 --> 01:05:17,440
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1111
01:05:49,739 --> 01:05:52,350
Tae Hee wants
to bump up the wedding.

1112
01:05:52,350 --> 01:05:54,480
She must be fond of our Jin Dan.

1113
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:55,920
The unit is in my name,

1114
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,120
so move in at any time you want.

1115
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,690
I don't want the woman I like...

1116
01:05:58,819 --> 01:06:01,219
to live in some dingy unit.

1117
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:03,989
Does it seem like a waste
now that I'm dating someone else?

1118
01:06:04,089 --> 01:06:07,060
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but the ship has already sailed.

1119
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:09,100
At least give me a chance.

1120
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:10,730
Go on a date with me as well...

1121
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:12,900
and then decide
who you wish to be with.

1122
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:16,100
