00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,771
<i>No, don't do this</i>

6
00:00:28,771 --> 00:00:30,401
<i>- Do not ask me</i>
- I can't believe...

7
00:00:30,401 --> 00:00:32,541
you're letting a child sing
at a place like this.

8
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:35,570
<i>- Do not want anything more from me</i>
- I know, right?

9
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,771
- She's only a kid.
- What a song.

10
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,811
- What is this?
- Over here.

11
00:00:39,811 --> 00:00:41,710
Are you kidding me?

12
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,081
- Who brought a kid here?
<i>- He is my lover</i>

13
00:00:44,481 --> 00:00:46,650
- Get her off the stage.
- Seriously.

14
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,150
What on earth is this?

15
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,250
- Over here!
- Someone get the manager.

16
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,420
- Someone get the manager.
- Unbelievable.

17
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,390
- Seriously.
- But I'm listening to her sing.

18
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,331
- Same here.
- Come on.

19
00:00:56,331 --> 00:00:59,761
Are you kidding me?
Who let a child sing?

20
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,100
- Dance as well.
<i>- Like a lie</i>

21
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,100

(Episode 1)

25
00:01:16,781 --> 00:01:18,120
Wait.

26
00:01:19,251 --> 00:01:21,790
You agreed to pay 500 dollars,

27
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,150
but this is only 300.

28
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,790
You're one shameless lady.

29
00:01:27,891 --> 00:01:29,831
This 300 dollars
is more than enough.

30
00:01:29,831 --> 00:01:33,131
How can you ask for 500
after ruining the mood in there?

31
00:01:33,131 --> 00:01:34,831
I almost got hit
by bottles just now.

32
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,631
She should've shaken
her body like so...

33
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:39,100
and danced to the song as well.

34
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,540
You call this a performance?

35
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,570
This isn't some elementary school
show-and-tell.

36
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,210
Look here.

37
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:47,611
She may not seem that way,
but Do Ra is a child actress.

38
00:01:47,611 --> 00:01:50,010
And this isn't how you treat one.

39
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:51,881
Everyone calls themselves
actors these days.

40
00:01:51,881 --> 00:01:55,450
They think being on TV once
makes them a darn actor!

41
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,551
Anyway, if you want
to be paid in full,

42
00:01:57,551 --> 00:02:00,021
she should at least
provide adequate service.

43
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:01,590
Because of her, I...

44
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,031
I paid you that much
because I feel sorry for her.

45
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:10,070
You are not to come back here.
Don't ever come back here!

46
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,471
Here. This is the tip I received.

47
00:02:15,471 --> 00:02:16,470
Take it.

48
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:20,611
Wait, we're not done here!

49
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,481
Unbelievable.

50
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,921
You should've done a better job.

51
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,051
Because of you, we were
only able to make 300 dollars.

52
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,120
Mom,

53
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,220
it's why I said
I didn't want to do this.

54
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,861
You have some audacity to say that.

55
00:02:35,861 --> 00:02:38,861
Don't you know I'm being hunted down
by creditors?

56
00:02:38,861 --> 00:02:40,030
Unbelievable.

57
00:02:42,701 --> 00:02:45,000
Here. Take this.

58
00:02:45,601 --> 00:02:48,541
Take this and go home.

59
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:49,870
Wait for me there.

60
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,981
Mom, where are you going?
Aren't you coming with me?

61
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,150
I can't go home
because of the creditors.

62
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,011
It's why you had to do a better job.

63
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:59,851
We needed to at least
earn 500 dollars tonight.

64
00:03:00,051 --> 00:03:01,590
I'm sorry, Mom.

65
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,551
Right. Well, head home.
It's cold outside.

66
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:06,160
Hurry on home.

67
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:08,731
Mom, tell me you'll be back.

68
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,400
All right. Just wait a few days.

69
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,231
Go home and take care
of Do Sik and Do Jun.

70
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:15,731
Got it?

71
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:18,370

- Thank you.

77

Do Ra, just a second.

80

This is a coupon.

81
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,551
A benefactor bought some
for single-parent families.

82
00:04:05,821 --> 00:04:07,451
Take it to
the local government office...

83
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:09,791
and they'll give you
rice and snacks for it.

84
00:04:12,391 --> 00:04:14,660
There are gift certificates too.

85
00:04:15,261 --> 00:04:16,261
Here.

86
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,601
Miss. I'm not from
a single-parent family.

87
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:28,841
I have a mom and a dad
and we're rich.

88

I don't need stuff like this.

89

It's on you today.

No.

I live that way.

104

136
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,580

Don't you eat any, then.
Do Jun and I will eat it all.

Can I have a packet of ramyeon?

147
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:29,010
Sure. You can have two packets.

148
00:08:29,211 --> 00:08:30,380
Great.

149
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,421
Have some.

it's really good. So good.

I like uncooked ramyeon,

but I miss
Mom's beef and potato jjigae too.

157
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,731
I explained to you...

158
00:09:17,931 --> 00:09:19,500
that Mom will be back
after ten nights.

159
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,231
Yes, but that was
over ten nights ago.

Where's your mom?

00:09:41,951 --> 00:09:43,050
Tell us now.

- Darn you.

You took our money
and you can afford boxes of noodles?

Do Sik. Do Ra.

172
00:10:02,211 --> 00:10:05,040
We don't know.
We don't know where she is.

173
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,010
Get out of our house.

174
00:10:07,211 --> 00:10:10,181
You can't come in here
with your shoes on!

175
00:10:10,181 --> 00:10:11,611
How dare you scream at us?

176
00:10:15,491 --> 00:10:17,191
- Let me go!
- No, don't.

177
00:10:17,191 --> 00:10:18,961
- Leave me alone.
- Do Jun. Do Ra.

178
00:10:19,861 --> 00:10:20,890
Let go.

179
00:10:23,961 --> 00:10:25,760
Tell your mom.

180
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:27,800
She's to pay us back.

181
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,270
She can bring the money
and buy him back.

182
00:10:31,701 --> 00:10:32,701
Let's go.

183
00:10:33,471 --> 00:10:35,670
- Let go!
- Don't do this.

184
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,311
- You can't take him.
- Let me go!

185
00:10:37,311 --> 00:10:38,811
- Come on.
- Let go.

186
00:10:38,811 --> 00:10:40,280
- Let go!
- Come along!

187
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,311
- No, you can't take him.
- Come.

188
00:10:42,311 --> 00:10:43,380
- Take him.
- Do Ra!

189
00:10:43,611 --> 00:10:45,581
- Let me go!
- Let go.

190
00:10:45,581 --> 00:10:46,851
- Back down.
- No!

191
00:10:47,181 --> 00:10:48,181
Do Ra!

192
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,250
- Let me go!
- Stay here.

193
00:10:54,461 --> 00:10:55,461
Do Jun!

194
00:10:55,461 --> 00:10:57,731
- Let me go.
- Do Jun!

195
00:10:58,601 --> 00:11:00,660
You can't take him. Let him go.

196
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,800
- Don't do this.
- Stay back.

197
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,500
- Don't do this.
- Mom said she'll pay you back.

198
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,701
- Move.
- Please.

199
00:11:04,701 --> 00:11:06,341
- Please let him go.
- Move!

200
00:11:06,341 --> 00:11:08,741
Don't take him. You can't.

201
00:11:09,571 --> 00:11:11,981
Tell your mom
to come over right away.

202
00:11:12,981 --> 00:11:15,510
We really don't know where she is.

203
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,811
We can't reach her. I swear.

204
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:20,050
So please, mister.

205
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:23,420
Please leave Do Jun behind.

206
00:11:23,591 --> 00:11:25,390
Let go of me, punk.

207
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,130
- Do Sik. Do Ra.
- I'll report you to the police.

208
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,760
For kidnapping!

209
00:11:44,111 --> 00:11:45,380
Tell your mom...

210
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:47,611
to pay us back.

211
00:11:48,481 --> 00:11:49,851
Or we'll sue her.

212
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,221
Let him go.

213
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,120
- Do Ra.
- Do Jun.

214
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,160
- Do Ra.
- Darn it.

215
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,221
It's okay.

216
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,030
I'm sorry.

217
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,931
I couldn't stop them.

218
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,821
Do Ra.

219
00:12:32,191 --> 00:12:34,290
Get up. Get your things.

220
00:12:34,491 --> 00:12:35,890
Get dressed.

221
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,630
Do Sik.

222
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,000
Do Sik. Get up.

223
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,500
- Get dressed.
- Where are we going?

224
00:12:42,571 --> 00:12:43,670
Be quiet and get dressed.

225
00:12:44,601 --> 00:12:46,841
- What's going on?
- Get up and pack your things.

226
00:12:51,441 --> 00:12:53,581
Where are we going, Mom?

227
00:12:53,811 --> 00:12:55,140
We're moving.

228
00:12:55,481 --> 00:12:58,380
Mom. Did you pay everything you owe?

229
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,981
That's why we're moving.

230
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,890
Darn it. Are you sure?

231
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:21,741
Come on, lady.

232
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,640
How could you bring
a family with three kids?

233
00:13:26,711 --> 00:13:29,050
What happened?

234
00:13:29,611 --> 00:13:31,010
Didn't you say
she had just one daughter?

235
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,380
That's why we signed the contract.

236
00:13:32,581 --> 00:13:34,851
That's what I thought,

237
00:13:34,851 --> 00:13:36,520
but I just found out myself.

238
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:40,620
Then you lied
about having a girl so you could...

239
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,160
live with us
when you have two more sons?

240
00:13:43,431 --> 00:13:44,831
I'm really sorry.

241
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,561
Can you let it go?

242
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,670
My kids are sweet and docile.

243
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,601
I'll make sure the place
is kept clean and they're quiet.

244
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,841
This is the only place I can afford
with that security deposit.

245
00:13:54,841 --> 00:13:56,640
What's going on?

246
00:13:57,471 --> 00:13:59,640
Please listen, Mr. Kim.

247
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,951
As you see, she has three children.

248
00:14:01,951 --> 00:14:04,380
But she lied to the realtor
that she had only one daughter...

249
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,420
just to rent our place.

250
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,750
It's so cramped already.

251
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,591
This isn't just right.

252
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,491
- Sun Young.
- Yes.

253
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:15,120
It doesn't matter
how many children she has.

254
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,130
We can't be doing this
in front of the kids.

255
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:20,231
- Ms. So.
- Yes?

256
00:14:20,231 --> 00:14:21,701
With many kids in the house,

257
00:14:21,701 --> 00:14:24,201
things can be youthful and bright.
Isn't that nice?

258
00:14:24,201 --> 00:14:25,841
Well, yes.

259
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,500
Welcome to our place.

260
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,510
Please let me know
if you feel uncomfortable.

261
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,611
Thank you, sir.

262
00:14:31,611 --> 00:14:33,410
I have dinner plans,
so I'm going out.

263
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:36,010
- Okay. Please be careful.
- My gosh.

264
00:14:36,351 --> 00:14:38,611
That's Mr. Kim.

265
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:41,181
He's just too soft-hearted.

266
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,790
They already moved their stuff,
so we have no choice.

267
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,321
Go inside then.

268
00:14:45,321 --> 00:14:47,260
Okay. Thank you so much.

269
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,591
My children are well-behaved.

270
00:14:49,591 --> 00:14:51,331
I promise we'll stay quiet.

271
00:14:51,331 --> 00:14:53,931
Thank you. I appreciate it.

272
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,530
I'm home.

273
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,471
Hey, son. Come here.

274
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,101
What are you doing out?

275
00:14:59,101 --> 00:15:00,571
They just moved in. Say hello.

276
00:15:00,571 --> 00:15:02,311
I see. Hello.

277
00:15:02,441 --> 00:15:03,640
This is my son.

278
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,711
Well...

279
00:15:04,711 --> 00:15:05,780
Hey.

280
00:15:06,181 --> 00:15:08,611
You're the kid from the other day?

281
00:15:08,811 --> 00:15:09,910
The guy from Seoul?

282
00:15:18,221 --> 00:15:20,691
Something unbelievable is happening.

283
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,290
I can't believe
I met him here again.

284
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,861
Is this where he lives?

285
00:15:29,201 --> 00:15:31,571
Hurry and go in.

286
00:15:31,571 --> 00:15:33,770
Get in there. Go ahead.

287
00:15:36,241 --> 00:15:37,341
Go in.

288
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:43,211
Mom, the bathroom is really clean.

289
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,211
I love it.

290
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:46,250
Gosh.

291
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,920
My goodness.

292
00:15:48,321 --> 00:15:49,920
This is really nice.

293
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:53,660
It's small,
but it has everything we need.

294
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,431
Isn't this nice?

295
00:15:55,961 --> 00:15:57,461
- Mom.
- Yes?

296
00:15:57,461 --> 00:16:00,861
I think it's great
that we're moving in here.

297
00:16:00,861 --> 00:16:01,861
I know, right?

298
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:03,101
By the way, Mom,

299
00:16:03,101 --> 00:16:06,040
shouldn't we eat jjajangmyeon
and tangsuyuk on a moving day?

300
00:16:06,101 --> 00:16:07,201
I want jjajangmyeon!

301
00:16:07,201 --> 00:16:09,770
Mom, I want to eat
jjajangmyeon and tangsuyuk.

302
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,270
All right. Today,

303
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,880
we're going to eat
jjajangmyeon and tangsuyuk!

304
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,010
- Yes! I'm so excited.
- Great!

305
00:16:17,981 --> 00:16:19,250
Are you happy?

306
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,920
Gosh, this feels so nice.

307
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:34,101
You know what, Sun Young?
I really don't like that lady.

308
00:16:34,331 --> 00:16:36,030
I understand the situation she's in,

309
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,571
but how could she lie
that she had only one daughter?

310
00:16:39,601 --> 00:16:42,071
She says she couldn't afford
the security deposit.

311
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:45,170
It's hard to find a clean place
with a low deposit in this area.

312
00:16:46,441 --> 00:16:48,951
I wonder what her husband does.

313
00:16:50,081 --> 00:16:51,181
Did he go broke?

314
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,650
Apparently, her husband is dead.

315
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,650
- What?
- My gosh.

316
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:56,191
- Her husband is dead?
- Yes.

317
00:16:56,191 --> 00:16:58,620
I just saw the youngest one
in the front yard,

318
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,290
so I asked when his dad was coming.

319
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,721
And he said his dad was dead.

320
00:17:02,331 --> 00:17:03,861
He went to his final rest.

321
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:06,601
I just asked it without thinking.

322
00:17:07,201 --> 00:17:09,571
Now I feel really bad for him.

323
00:17:10,101 --> 00:17:11,871
Then she's a widow?

324
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:15,610
So she's a widow with three kids.

325
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:17,371
But what's with her outfit?

326
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:21,280
I don't think
she's an ordinary widow.

327
00:17:22,451 --> 00:17:25,050
Why does it have to be a widow?
That's unsettling.

328
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,250
You're also widowed.

329
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,721
Why would you say that
about a widow?

330
00:17:27,721 --> 00:17:28,721
Hey!

331
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,691
Mom. Can I get 50 dollars
so I can buy some workbooks?

332
00:17:32,691 --> 00:17:34,391
What workbooks?

333
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:35,631
What?

334
00:17:36,191 --> 00:17:37,260
Math workbooks.

335
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:40,560
I see. All right.

336
00:17:41,431 --> 00:17:42,731
Then...

337
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,040
Here. It's 60 dollars.

338
00:17:47,201 --> 00:17:48,441
I gave you an extra ten dollars.

339
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:50,971
Get yourself something to eat
when you feel hungry while studying.

340
00:17:50,971 --> 00:17:52,610
Thank you, Your Highness.

341
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,310
No problem.

342
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,151
My gosh.

343
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,750
You always keep...

344
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,181
your wallet open for Dae Chung.

345
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,790
Hey, it's like
you buy workbooks every day.

346
00:18:05,121 --> 00:18:06,621
Are you sure
you aren't pocketing the money?

347
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,991
Auntie Myung Dong,
how could you say that?

348
00:18:10,191 --> 00:18:12,161
What do you think I am?

349
00:18:12,161 --> 00:18:14,760
You buy workbooks all the time,

350
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,701
so I wonder
why your grades never improve.

351
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,600
You're touching my sore spot again.

352
00:18:19,401 --> 00:18:21,971
Auntie Myung Dong,
do you want to fight me?

353
00:18:21,971 --> 00:18:23,540
Come on, Myung Dong.

354
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,810
I'm sure
his grades will improve soon.

355
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,780
Dae Chung.

356
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,280
I don't care how much money
I spend on your books and lessons.

357
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,221
I just want you to study hard.

358
00:18:33,921 --> 00:18:35,050
Yes, ma'am!

359
00:18:35,651 --> 00:18:37,191
- I'm going out.
- Okay.

360
00:18:37,191 --> 00:18:38,691
Have a good day.

361
00:18:41,991 --> 00:18:43,830
He's your boyfriend, not your son.

362
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:46,461
By the way,

363
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,931
I understand
she was your best friend,

364
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,641
but don't you think it is too much
to cook for a memorial service...

365
00:18:52,641 --> 00:18:54,040
of your friend's father-in-law
who's already dead?

366
00:18:54,401 --> 00:18:56,110
And even if you didn't,

367
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,711
they're affluent enough...

368
00:18:57,711 --> 00:19:00,381
to hire people to cook
for the memorial service.

369
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,580
Soo Yeon's daughter
and her husband, Chairman Gong,

370
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,621
like my sikhye,
so I'm just doing this for them.

371
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,621
Mother, I put some sikhye...

372
00:19:08,621 --> 00:19:10,621
in the fridge,
so you can eat it if you want.

373
00:19:10,621 --> 00:19:12,921
- I'm going out. See you.
- Gosh.

374
00:19:12,921 --> 00:19:14,421
I'll see you later, Sun Young.

375
00:19:14,691 --> 00:19:16,830
She puts a lot of effort
into making sikhye...

376
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,500
for her friend's dead father-in-law,

377
00:19:20,231 --> 00:19:23,270
but she treats her own mother-in-law
like a stray dog...

378
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,070
when she's alive and kicking.

379
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,840
What? "Eat it if you want?"

380
00:19:27,971 --> 00:19:29,510
Come on, Mom.

381
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,310
What's so hard
about getting it from the fridge?

382
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,780
I'll get you the sikhye.

383
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,481
Forget it!

384
00:19:34,911 --> 00:19:36,110
That darn brat.

385
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:39,151
She's being so cheap.
I don't need her darn sikhye.

386
00:19:42,651 --> 00:19:45,050
The sikhye is really good.
Right, Mom?

387
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,121
Yes. You know what?

388
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,731
Sun Young does make
really good sikhye.

389
00:19:51,461 --> 00:19:53,830
She's good at many other things too.

390
00:19:56,431 --> 00:19:58,631
By the way, Myung Dong,

391
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:00,340
I don't think
Sun Young has any self-respect.

392
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,641
Why would she go
to the memorial service...

393
00:20:04,641 --> 00:20:05,810
of her friend's
father-in-law like that?

394
00:20:06,911 --> 00:20:08,711
That even hurts my pride.

395
00:20:09,411 --> 00:20:13,080
Her friend also treats her
like her own sister.

396
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,280
That's why.

397
00:20:14,921 --> 00:20:17,750
She's also really nice to Dae Chung.

398
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,191
It's not easy to take care
of your friend's son like that.

399
00:20:20,921 --> 00:20:23,131
I guess you're right. By the way,

400
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:27,201
why would a lady
from such a rich family...

401
00:20:27,201 --> 00:20:30,830
be friends with someone so ordinary
like Sun Young?

402
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,701
I mean, they're
best friends of all time.

403
00:20:32,701 --> 00:20:35,201
Don't you find it mysterious?

404
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:36,840
You're right.

405
00:20:39,681 --> 00:20:42,780
Maybe Sun Young has
a big picture in mind.

406
00:20:43,411 --> 00:20:46,221
A big picture? What do you mean?

407
00:20:47,421 --> 00:20:51,191
Sun Young's friend has
a really pretty daughter.

408
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,621
Maybe she wants Dae Chung
to be her son-in-law.

409
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:58,891
Is she doing the whole thing
to make her friend her in-law?

410
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:01,201
Come on. It's not like
she's lost her mind.

411
00:21:01,201 --> 00:21:03,600
- Why would she take in a foundling?
- My gosh!

412
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,671
Stop it. Why would you do that?

413
00:21:05,671 --> 00:21:07,641
I'm just saying that
because we're alone.

414
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,610
If Sun Young heard you say that,
you'd be kicked out of this house.

415
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,580
I'd be kicked out too!

416
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,681
- I'm home.
- My goodness.

417
00:21:15,518 --> 00:21:19,288
My gosh. What's wrong?
Why are you so surprised?

418
00:21:20,087 --> 00:21:22,157
It's nothing, Hyun Chul.

419
00:21:22,917 --> 00:21:24,528
Where's Sun Young?

420
00:21:24,528 --> 00:21:27,627
Well... Sun Young went to attend...

421
00:21:27,627 --> 00:21:30,367
the memorial service
of her rich friend's father-in-law.

422
00:21:30,367 --> 00:21:31,968
She's out.

423
00:21:31,968 --> 00:21:34,068
I see. You mean Soo Yeon's.

424
00:21:34,238 --> 00:21:35,238
Yes.

425
00:21:35,768 --> 00:21:36,837
Okay.

426
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,508
Gosh.

427
00:21:44,778 --> 00:21:46,818
That was so close.

428
00:21:46,947 --> 00:21:49,318
What did I do? Don't be silly.

429
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:09,197
Hello? It's me. I'm leaving now.

430
00:22:09,837 --> 00:22:10,837
Okay.

431
00:22:30,127 --> 00:22:32,058
I'm going to do something today.

432
00:22:32,288 --> 00:22:33,697
I'll smash them.

433
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:38,768
Ma Ri, can you make
a deep bow to your grandfather?

434
00:22:38,927 --> 00:22:39,927
Of course.

435
00:22:40,768 --> 00:22:42,298
Two and a half bows.

436
00:22:43,308 --> 00:22:45,708
You're good. All right then.

437
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:46,978
Honey, you do it with her.

438
00:22:46,978 --> 00:22:47,978
Okay.

439
00:22:54,978 --> 00:22:56,947
Wait. Stop!

440
00:22:57,887 --> 00:22:59,548
I'm also going to bow.

441
00:23:00,417 --> 00:23:01,887
Why are you leaving me out...

442
00:23:01,887 --> 00:23:03,357
when it's a memorial service
for my man?

443
00:23:03,587 --> 00:23:04,587
Have you lost your mind?

444
00:23:04,587 --> 00:23:06,587
How dare you come here
completely wasted like this?

445
00:23:06,587 --> 00:23:08,328
Let go of me.

446
00:23:09,357 --> 00:23:10,897
It's not like I'm somewhere
I shouldn't be at.

447
00:23:11,268 --> 00:23:12,867
I'm going to bow at this service...

448
00:23:12,867 --> 00:23:14,367
like his granddaughter
and daughter-in-law.

449
00:23:14,367 --> 00:23:16,238
I have a right
to bow at this service too.

450
00:23:16,837 --> 00:23:17,937
- My goodness.
- Gosh.

451
00:23:19,968 --> 00:23:22,677
Chairman, it's me.

452
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:26,248
It's the one
you dearly cherished and adored.

453
00:23:26,248 --> 00:23:28,177
Hong Ae Kyo is here.

454
00:23:29,647 --> 00:23:30,917
You've lost your mind.

455
00:23:30,917 --> 00:23:31,988
I'm sorry about this.

456
00:23:32,147 --> 00:23:33,657
Get up this second.

457
00:23:33,657 --> 00:23:34,887
- Mom...
- Get up.

458
00:23:34,887 --> 00:23:36,687
Get out of my way!

459
00:23:38,357 --> 00:23:40,927
Who are you to stop me
from bowing...

460
00:23:40,927 --> 00:23:42,758
to my beloved man?

461
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:47,038
No one moves!

462
00:23:47,837 --> 00:23:49,468
Don't even try to drag me out.

463
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:52,268
If you do,
I'll take my own life right here.

464
00:23:54,137 --> 00:23:56,177
Ma Ri, you should head upstairs.

465
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:57,808
Sun Young, can you...

466
00:23:58,447 --> 00:23:59,778
Right, of course.

467
00:24:01,147 --> 00:24:02,377
Ma Ri, let's head upstairs.

468
00:24:07,357 --> 00:24:08,917
Jin Dan is my son.

469
00:24:10,927 --> 00:24:13,187
That fact is beyond doubt...

470
00:24:13,597 --> 00:24:14,758
and I stand by it.

471
00:24:15,697 --> 00:24:19,068
So have Jin Dan placed
on the family register as my son.

472
00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:23,038
Have him run
one of the subsidiaries.

473
00:24:24,268 --> 00:24:26,407
Hong Ae Kyo is the one
who gave birth to my son,

474
00:24:27,337 --> 00:24:29,508
and she lived in secrecy
while putting her trust in me.

475
00:24:30,447 --> 00:24:34,278
So even after I pass away,
you will treat her with respect.

476
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:37,117
Know that
I'll be watching from above.

477
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:41,417
Gong Jin Taek,
why aren't you saying anything?

478
00:24:41,887 --> 00:24:42,958
Acknowledge it.

479
00:24:43,657 --> 00:24:46,127
Yes, Father.

480
00:24:49,328 --> 00:24:50,528
Jin Taek.

481
00:24:51,197 --> 00:24:53,468
You told my darling
that you understood.

482
00:24:53,937 --> 00:24:55,167
So how is it...

483
00:24:55,397 --> 00:24:58,637
that you won't let me bow
at his memorial service?

484
00:25:00,407 --> 00:25:02,978
He told you
to treat me with respect.

485
00:25:03,337 --> 00:25:04,808
So why are you
being dismissive of me?

486
00:25:05,578 --> 00:25:08,018
Why aren't you acknowledging
his final words?

487
00:25:08,278 --> 00:25:11,218
He's watching you from above!

488
00:25:12,087 --> 00:25:13,248
Jin Dan?

489
00:25:16,258 --> 00:25:17,458
Gosh, my puppy.

490
00:25:19,288 --> 00:25:20,328
My puppy.

491
00:25:24,627 --> 00:25:26,328
Jin Dan, my gosh.

492
00:25:26,627 --> 00:25:28,238
When did you get here?

493
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:31,107
Were you granted a leave
for your father's memorial service?

494
00:25:34,107 --> 00:25:36,738
Jin Dan, I'm glad
you came here today.

495
00:25:36,978 --> 00:25:40,008
I'm no longer going to live
as your father's secret lover.

496
00:25:40,347 --> 00:25:42,278
I'm done with all the secrecy.

497
00:25:44,117 --> 00:25:45,447
My Jin Dan...

498
00:25:46,018 --> 00:25:48,617
is your half-brother
whom you share a father with.

499
00:25:49,187 --> 00:25:50,788
What does that make me to you, then?

500
00:25:53,657 --> 00:25:56,357
Jin Dan calls me his mother.

501
00:25:56,758 --> 00:25:57,798
Jin Taek...

502
00:25:58,268 --> 00:26:00,468
Since that's the case,
you'll also call me Mother.

503
00:26:01,197 --> 00:26:02,667
And Jang Soo Yeon, you!

504
00:26:03,568 --> 00:26:05,068
Starting tomorrow,
you'll refer to me...

505
00:26:05,068 --> 00:26:06,568
as your mother-in-law. Got it?

506
00:26:08,508 --> 00:26:11,778
Also, as of today, I'll be staying
at the main house...

507
00:26:12,377 --> 00:26:14,078
and not the annex.

508
00:26:14,917 --> 00:26:16,718
I will stay in the room
that was occupied by my man,

509
00:26:16,718 --> 00:26:18,488
the late Chairman Gong Dae Gil.

510
00:26:19,218 --> 00:26:21,117
No one will stop me!

511
00:26:22,357 --> 00:26:24,258
Ae Kyo, you can't.

512
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:25,528
- You can't.
- Grandma!

513
00:26:27,357 --> 00:26:29,228
Let Mom be.

514
00:27:04,298 --> 00:27:05,367
Jin Taek.

515
00:27:06,867 --> 00:27:09,798
I apologize on behalf of my mother.

516
00:27:12,008 --> 00:27:13,468
I'm sorry we caused a scene...

517
00:27:14,308 --> 00:27:16,508
on the day of
Father's memorial service.

518
00:27:20,548 --> 00:27:21,947
You're not to blame.

519
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:26,048
I wish to be alone, so head out.

520
00:27:36,328 --> 00:27:37,328
Jin Taek.

521
00:27:39,127 --> 00:27:40,768
I'm well aware...

522
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:45,137
of how you think of my mom and me.

523
00:27:47,308 --> 00:27:49,437
So I'm constantly grateful for you
accepting me as your brother...

524
00:27:50,778 --> 00:27:52,708
despite your personal feelings.

525
00:27:57,087 --> 00:27:58,087
It may be hard for you...

526
00:27:59,518 --> 00:28:02,117
to forgive my mother.

527
00:28:03,857 --> 00:28:06,828
However, my mother...

528
00:28:08,028 --> 00:28:10,028
spent a long time living in agony.

529
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:14,238
Father spoke his mind
before passing,

530
00:28:15,597 --> 00:28:16,897
so maybe it's time for you...

531
00:28:18,008 --> 00:28:19,337
to accept her.

532
00:28:27,647 --> 00:28:29,347
It pained me to live
in the main house...

533
00:28:30,218 --> 00:28:33,318
while my mom resided alone
in the annex.

534
00:28:35,357 --> 00:28:36,917
This doesn't seem right anymore.

535
00:28:39,687 --> 00:28:42,958
Later on,
when I marry or leave this house,

536
00:28:43,728 --> 00:28:45,197
I'll move out with my mom.

537
00:28:47,238 --> 00:28:48,437
So please let her...

538
00:28:49,798 --> 00:28:51,708
live for a few years...

539
00:28:52,337 --> 00:28:56,038
as a proper member of this family
in this house.

540
00:28:58,308 --> 00:29:00,377
Wouldn't that appease her soul?

541
00:29:06,318 --> 00:29:07,417
Please.

542
00:29:09,258 --> 00:29:10,288
Brother.

543
00:29:30,677 --> 00:29:32,048
Honey, my gosh.

544
00:29:32,778 --> 00:29:34,748
That's preposterous.

545
00:29:35,048 --> 00:29:37,387
I can't possibly live under
the same roof as Ae Kyo.

546
00:29:38,748 --> 00:29:39,917
As if I like it any better.

547
00:29:42,157 --> 00:29:45,157
If I think of my late mother,
I know it's absurd.

548
00:29:46,758 --> 00:29:49,127
But what can I do?

549
00:29:49,657 --> 00:29:52,068
I can't ignore my father's will.

550
00:29:52,068 --> 00:29:53,798
She keeps playing
the recording she has.

551
00:29:55,937 --> 00:29:59,038
Are you sure you can handle this?

552
00:30:02,208 --> 00:30:03,778
I have no other choice.

553
00:30:03,778 --> 00:30:05,478
It's not like
I can drag her out of here.

554
00:30:07,048 --> 00:30:10,447
Jin Dan said he'd take her with him
when he eventually moves out.

555
00:30:11,417 --> 00:30:13,417
So we'll live with her until then.

556
00:30:15,187 --> 00:30:17,328
As if it's that simple.

557
00:30:18,157 --> 00:30:21,157
Letting Ae Kyo
move into your parents' room...

558
00:30:21,258 --> 00:30:24,968
is the same as acknowledging her
as an elder of this family.

559
00:30:25,528 --> 00:30:27,697
Can you truly
refer to her as Mother?

560
00:30:29,238 --> 00:30:30,538
I can't.

561
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:32,107
I can't call her Mother...

562
00:30:32,107 --> 00:30:34,078
when we used to attend
high school together.

563
00:30:34,637 --> 00:30:36,038
Keep that in mind.

564
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:46,947
You brat.

565
00:30:47,218 --> 00:30:49,387
Get out of here.

566
00:30:50,318 --> 00:30:52,528
No, over my dead body.

567
00:30:53,127 --> 00:30:54,528
I'll stay and haunt this room
as a ghost if I must.

568
00:30:56,258 --> 00:30:58,828
Unbelievable.
How is this appropriate?

569
00:30:59,768 --> 00:31:00,968
How can you live with yourself?

570
00:31:02,897 --> 00:31:04,637
Even a wild beast would know better.

571
00:31:05,468 --> 00:31:06,708
My gosh.

572
00:31:06,808 --> 00:31:09,607
Because the late chairman's wife
took us in all those years ago,

573
00:31:09,708 --> 00:31:13,447
we were able to live our lives
like decent human beings.

574
00:31:14,478 --> 00:31:17,687
But rather than being grateful,
you seduced the chairman.

575
00:31:18,087 --> 00:31:21,818
She shed tears of blood before dying
all because of you.

576
00:31:21,917 --> 00:31:24,687
So how dare you
crawl back into this house?

577
00:31:26,728 --> 00:31:28,058
Ma'am.

578
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:31,498
I wouldn't be able to face you
after I pass away.

579
00:31:33,328 --> 00:31:35,038
- Get out of here.
- No.

580
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:37,607
You can't be forgiven, so get out.

581
00:31:38,907 --> 00:31:41,008
Grandma, stop it.

582
00:31:42,508 --> 00:31:45,607
Grandma, stop treating Mom this way.

583
00:31:46,347 --> 00:31:47,877
Treating her this way...

584
00:31:48,518 --> 00:31:50,318
is the same as denying me.

585
00:31:51,587 --> 00:31:52,587
What?

586
00:31:53,488 --> 00:31:56,488
Anyway, Jin Taek approved.

587
00:31:57,828 --> 00:31:59,127
He allowed you to stay here.

588
00:32:02,258 --> 00:32:03,397
What?

589
00:32:04,528 --> 00:32:07,268
Is that true?
Did he really allow it?

590
00:32:16,907 --> 00:32:17,907
Gosh.

591
00:32:20,877 --> 00:32:21,947
My gosh.

592
00:32:23,677 --> 00:32:24,718
Soo Yeon, goodness.

593
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,758
You didn't have
to pack so much food.

594
00:32:28,058 --> 00:32:29,657
As if that's a lot.

595
00:32:29,657 --> 00:32:31,788
- It's always a blessing to share.
- Gosh.

596
00:32:31,788 --> 00:32:34,357
Your son loves his meat,
so grill some for him.

597
00:32:34,627 --> 00:32:36,328
- Thanks.
- Boys his age have huge appetites.

598
00:32:37,097 --> 00:32:38,367
What's this?

599
00:32:38,427 --> 00:32:41,937
It's nothing.
I wanted to express my gratitude.

600
00:32:42,167 --> 00:32:43,937
- Take it.
- Gosh, no.

601
00:32:44,238 --> 00:32:46,038
I can't come back here
if you make this a habit.

602
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:48,137
I won't
attend the service next year.

603
00:32:48,137 --> 00:32:51,647
Come on. Can't you see
how grateful I am?

604
00:32:52,748 --> 00:32:54,177
Okay, fine. Then think of it...

605
00:32:54,177 --> 00:32:56,218
as pocket money for Dae Chung.

606
00:32:56,218 --> 00:32:57,647
I'm giving it to him
as his mom's friend.

607
00:32:57,917 --> 00:33:00,288
Sun Young, please.

608
00:33:00,288 --> 00:33:01,857
My gosh.

609
00:33:02,887 --> 00:33:05,687
Fine. I appreciate it.

610
00:33:06,127 --> 00:33:08,228
I'm the one who's more grateful.

611
00:33:08,228 --> 00:33:10,627
No one is ever this good to me.

612
00:33:11,627 --> 00:33:15,437
By the way,
Ae Kyo must've truly lost it.

613
00:33:15,437 --> 00:33:18,167
How can she tell you to refer to her
as your mother-in-law?

614
00:33:20,538 --> 00:33:24,248
I knew she was
a shameless brat, but...

615
00:33:25,407 --> 00:33:27,078
So what now?

616
00:33:27,078 --> 00:33:29,377
You'll be forced to face her
every morning.

617
00:33:29,377 --> 00:33:30,917
I don't know.

618
00:33:31,417 --> 00:33:34,018
I don't want to think about
what is going to happen from here.

619
00:33:44,697 --> 00:33:48,437
He must be serious
about his studies...

620
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:50,768
considering he still isn't home.

621
00:34:01,447 --> 00:34:02,447
You.

622
00:34:02,447 --> 00:34:05,018
My gosh. What the...

623
00:34:09,087 --> 00:34:11,288
Seriously. My heart almost stopped.

624
00:34:12,687 --> 00:34:13,788
Kiddo.

625
00:34:14,228 --> 00:34:16,657
Why are you out here at this hour
and not in bed?

626
00:34:19,898 --> 00:34:20,967
Well...

627
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:24,967
I was waiting for you to come home.

628
00:34:26,108 --> 00:34:27,308
You were waiting for me?

629
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:29,208
Why?

630
00:34:30,177 --> 00:34:31,277
The other day,

631
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:33,547
you carried
those heavy boxes for me.

632
00:34:34,078 --> 00:34:35,617
I wanted to thank you.

633
00:34:39,018 --> 00:34:41,088
Here. It's a token of my gratitude.

634
00:34:41,088 --> 00:34:42,788
Hang it on your backpack.

635
00:34:44,358 --> 00:34:45,927
This wasn't necessary.

636
00:34:46,558 --> 00:34:48,498
As if that was a big deal.

637
00:34:48,828 --> 00:34:51,398
Well, I don't see it that way.

638
00:34:52,197 --> 00:34:54,998
Sure. Thanks for this.

639
00:34:55,338 --> 00:34:58,308
You're quite decent, aren't you?

640
00:34:59,538 --> 00:35:00,567
Thanks again.

641
00:35:00,938 --> 00:35:01,938
By the way,

642
00:35:02,608 --> 00:35:05,547
wasn't the girl you were with
your big sister?

643
00:35:05,878 --> 00:35:08,148
I met your family earlier,

644
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:09,378
but I didn't see her.

645
00:35:09,378 --> 00:35:11,288
I wanted to say hi to her too.

646
00:35:11,717 --> 00:35:12,748
What?

647
00:35:13,217 --> 00:35:15,387
Oh, right.

648
00:35:15,657 --> 00:35:16,958
Well...

649
00:35:17,358 --> 00:35:20,828
She's not my big sister.
She's just someone I know.

650
00:35:21,257 --> 00:35:23,527
I see.

651
00:35:23,858 --> 00:35:27,367
I'm fascinated by how
I got to meet you like this again.

652
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:30,137
Come to think of it,
it really is fascinating.

653
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:31,938
How can this be?

654
00:35:31,938 --> 00:35:33,808
Don't you think
it's a rare coincidence?

655
00:35:33,808 --> 00:35:35,637
Right? Isn't it fascinating?

656
00:35:37,108 --> 00:35:40,447
I wonder who laid down the bridge...

657
00:35:40,447 --> 00:35:42,717
that led us to be
in each other's lives.

658
00:35:43,777 --> 00:35:44,918
Could we...

659
00:35:45,487 --> 00:35:48,157
be destined to be together?

660
00:35:49,657 --> 00:35:50,657
Hey.

661
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:53,088
You should hurry off to bed.

662
00:35:54,398 --> 00:35:57,027
Hey, you seem
to be drifting off to sleep.

663
00:35:57,628 --> 00:35:58,797
You're totally out of it.

664
00:35:59,268 --> 00:36:00,268
What?

665
00:36:01,668 --> 00:36:05,007
Oh, right. I wish you a good night.

666
00:36:06,938 --> 00:36:09,308
- What...
- Hey.

667
00:36:26,788 --> 00:36:27,927
Hey,

668
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:29,927
if it wasn't for me,

669
00:36:29,927 --> 00:36:31,927
you would've tripped
and broken your nose.

670
00:36:31,927 --> 00:36:33,597
Watch where you're going
from now on.

671
00:36:34,097 --> 00:36:35,097
Got it?

672
00:36:35,467 --> 00:36:36,467
Good night.

673
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:50,317
He is my destiny.

674
00:36:51,588 --> 00:36:52,947
My prince.

675
00:36:54,757 --> 00:36:57,157
I'm no longer in love
with Hee Chul of Super Junior.

676
00:36:58,958 --> 00:37:01,797
He's the one I want.

677
00:37:08,338 --> 00:37:10,438
- Take care.
- That cost quite a lot.

678
00:37:10,668 --> 00:37:12,567
I can't believe that woman.

679
00:37:12,567 --> 00:37:14,907
She's renting out a room
in someone else's home...

680
00:37:14,907 --> 00:37:17,137
but goes around looking like
a rich lady.

681
00:37:17,648 --> 00:37:19,547
- Who?
- Who else?

682
00:37:20,478 --> 00:37:23,547
Hey, it's Do Ra and her mother
who live in the room at our place.

683
00:37:23,748 --> 00:37:26,047
One should know their place.

684
00:37:26,047 --> 00:37:27,487
She's adamant about
making her daughter an actress.

685
00:37:27,487 --> 00:37:30,588
Look at her dragging the girl around
without taking her to school.

686
00:37:31,427 --> 00:37:33,558
I don't care how money-mad you are.

687
00:37:33,558 --> 00:37:35,257
You can't do that to your own child.

688
00:37:35,257 --> 00:37:38,067
Come on. It's not like Do Ra
skips school every day.

689
00:37:38,398 --> 00:37:41,438
She must have
one of those auditions today.

690
00:37:42,367 --> 00:37:44,967
She's not your average woman.

691
00:37:44,967 --> 00:37:46,237
Be careful with her.

692
00:37:46,507 --> 00:37:49,108
What? What do you mean by that?

693
00:37:49,108 --> 00:37:51,608
Haven't you heard
the rumors about her?

694
00:37:53,494 --> 00:37:55,664
Rumors? What rumors?

695
00:37:56,795 --> 00:37:57,894
Sun Young.

696
00:37:58,334 --> 00:38:01,264
Sun Young, there you are.

697
00:38:01,534 --> 00:38:02,934
Listen.

698
00:38:03,604 --> 00:38:07,104
I think it'll be wise for us
to have Do Ra's mom move out.

699
00:38:08,405 --> 00:38:09,974
What are you talking about?

700
00:38:09,974 --> 00:38:12,284
We can't do that
when they just moved in.

701
00:38:12,284 --> 00:38:15,784
Tell them that our room is too small
for Myung Dong and me...

702
00:38:15,784 --> 00:38:18,115
and we need it for Myung Dong.

703
00:38:18,115 --> 00:38:20,385
Just make them leave
any way you can.

704
00:38:20,755 --> 00:38:23,394
Why, Mother? Did something happen?

705
00:38:23,994 --> 00:38:25,055
Well...

706
00:38:26,525 --> 00:38:28,224
You see...

707
00:38:28,564 --> 00:38:31,994
Do Ra's mom
has the worst reputation.

708
00:38:31,994 --> 00:38:34,735
She leaves at night
with heavy makeup on.

709
00:38:34,735 --> 00:38:36,874
We both know that it's nothing good.

710
00:38:36,874 --> 00:38:40,474
What else can a woman
covered in heavy makeup...

711
00:38:40,474 --> 00:38:41,704
be doing at night?

712
00:38:42,715 --> 00:38:45,314
Gosh. I guess.

713
00:38:45,784 --> 00:38:48,584
- I've been iffy about that too.
- Exactly.

714
00:38:49,255 --> 00:38:52,084
I don't want our neighbors
to think poorly of us...

715
00:38:52,084 --> 00:38:55,354
- because of her.
- That's how it'll be.

716
00:38:55,354 --> 00:38:56,795
- Sun Young.
- Goodness.

717
00:39:00,624 --> 00:39:02,695
How could you say that about her?

718
00:39:03,564 --> 00:39:04,695
Dad...

719
00:39:05,164 --> 00:39:08,405
Do Ra's mom is trying her best...

720
00:39:08,405 --> 00:39:10,735
to raise her three children
by herself.

721
00:39:11,175 --> 00:39:13,704
You should be thinking about
how to help her,

722
00:39:13,704 --> 00:39:15,675
not speak ill of her.

723
00:39:16,845 --> 00:39:19,084
Dad, I'm sorry.

724
00:39:21,215 --> 00:39:22,555
I'm heading out for a bit.

725
00:39:22,715 --> 00:39:26,184
Dad, at least wear a scarf.

726
00:39:26,184 --> 00:39:27,684
It'll be cold at night.

727
00:39:28,255 --> 00:39:30,224
I can't have you catching a cold.

728
00:39:33,124 --> 00:39:34,124
Hold on a second.

729
00:39:34,865 --> 00:39:37,934
That was directed at me, wasn't it?

730
00:39:38,235 --> 00:39:40,104
I mean... What the...

731
00:39:40,104 --> 00:39:42,534
The former school principal speaks.

732
00:39:42,534 --> 00:39:43,974
Who is he to patronize me...

733
00:39:43,974 --> 00:39:45,675
and in that loud voice of his?

734
00:39:46,104 --> 00:39:49,644
Hello, I'm Park Do Ra's mother.

735
00:39:49,644 --> 00:39:51,345
- Right.
- Here.

736
00:39:52,175 --> 00:39:53,885
Hi, there.

737
00:39:53,885 --> 00:39:56,755
I'm Park Do Ra's mother.

738
00:39:56,755 --> 00:39:59,825
Do Ra worked hard for this audition.

739
00:39:59,825 --> 00:40:01,025
Please think fondly of her.

740
00:40:01,025 --> 00:40:02,624
(Child Actor Audition)

741
00:40:26,385 --> 00:40:27,385
Hey.

742
00:40:29,715 --> 00:40:31,155
You can meet me today?

743
00:40:31,155 --> 00:40:32,184
Dae Chung.

744
00:40:32,184 --> 00:40:35,124
Right. I'll run over there
as soon as school ends.

745
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:44,034
It seems to me
that he has a new girlfriend.

746
00:40:44,664 --> 00:40:45,664
Who can it be?

747
00:40:46,865 --> 00:40:49,334
I can't let him have a girlfriend.

748
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:54,345
Dad,

749
00:40:54,604 --> 00:40:57,275
I'm being bullied by my friends.

750
00:40:57,275 --> 00:40:58,575
They've been bullying me.

751
00:40:59,215 --> 00:41:00,985
My school uniform skirt...

752
00:41:06,325 --> 00:41:09,525
Even though
it was covered in dirt...

753
00:41:12,255 --> 00:41:14,624
"Even though my skirt was torn
and covered in dirt,"

754
00:41:14,624 --> 00:41:16,795
"no one in this family noticed."

755
00:41:16,795 --> 00:41:19,465
"Only my teacher noticed
who finally helped me."

756
00:41:19,465 --> 00:41:20,934
Say it like that.

757
00:41:23,474 --> 00:41:26,045
I can't believe you.

758
00:41:26,045 --> 00:41:27,345
How can you ruin this audition...

759
00:41:27,345 --> 00:41:29,775
when I have reminded you
of how important it was?

760
00:41:29,775 --> 00:41:32,485
And you lost the part
to Bi Bi of all people!

761
00:41:32,485 --> 00:41:33,644
Unbelievable.

762
00:41:33,644 --> 00:41:35,385
Where was your head at...

763
00:41:35,385 --> 00:41:37,584
that you forgot your darn lines?

764
00:41:37,784 --> 00:41:40,584
I told you that acting
was all about being focused.

765
00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:41,925
Immerse yourself in the character.

766
00:41:41,925 --> 00:41:44,325
Do you know how much money
I spent on you today?

767
00:41:44,325 --> 00:41:45,394
We barely had enough,

768
00:41:45,394 --> 00:41:46,965
but I paid for our transportation,
the buns, and the beverages.

769
00:41:46,965 --> 00:41:49,865
So what are you
going to do about it?

770
00:41:50,334 --> 00:41:52,534
I never said
I wanted to be an actress.

771
00:41:52,534 --> 00:41:54,664
If you like acting so much,
be one yourself.

772
00:41:54,664 --> 00:41:56,075
Why do you want me to act?

773
00:41:56,874 --> 00:41:58,204
What's wrong with her?

774
00:41:58,505 --> 00:42:00,905
Go home
and look after your brothers.

775
00:42:00,905 --> 00:42:02,575
- I have to work, okay?
- I don't care.

776
00:42:02,675 --> 00:42:04,845
What got into her today?

777
00:42:06,744 --> 00:42:09,084
Come on. Give the ball to me.

778
00:42:15,525 --> 00:42:18,624
He always goes to a salon
to straighten his curly hair,

779
00:42:18,894 --> 00:42:19,994
and always comes home late.

780
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:23,164
He always texts and giggles.

781
00:42:24,334 --> 00:42:26,164
He's not staying out late to study.

782
00:42:27,735 --> 00:42:29,305
He's up to something else.

783
00:42:29,974 --> 00:42:31,735
I'll find out what that is today.

784
00:42:35,144 --> 00:42:38,075
- It was so close.
- Was it?

785
00:42:39,584 --> 00:42:40,644
So what now?

786
00:42:42,514 --> 00:42:44,255
- It's so cold.
- Let's hurry.

787
00:42:46,255 --> 00:42:48,055
Are you off? See you.

788
00:42:48,055 --> 00:42:49,854
- Take care.
- Bye.

789
00:43:25,124 --> 00:43:26,164
What's that?

790
00:43:27,494 --> 00:43:28,965
A motorcycle?

791
00:43:31,135 --> 00:43:32,934
- Dae Chung.
- Jung Mi.

792
00:43:35,164 --> 00:43:36,434
You're right on time.

793
00:43:36,775 --> 00:43:37,874
That woman.

794
00:43:38,675 --> 00:43:40,604
It's Jung Mi
who works at Sol Hair Salon.

795
00:43:41,275 --> 00:43:42,474
Where will we go today?

796
00:43:43,345 --> 00:43:46,584
I don't mind going
anywhere you want.

797
00:43:46,985 --> 00:43:49,814
Really? Then will you take me
to the end of the earth?

798
00:43:50,155 --> 00:43:51,354
You bet.

799
00:43:51,814 --> 00:43:52,825
Name the place.

800
00:43:52,825 --> 00:43:55,854
I'll take you to the edge
of the earth if you want.

801
00:43:56,525 --> 00:43:57,724
Dae Chung.

802
00:44:00,724 --> 00:44:01,764
Let's go.

803
00:44:04,494 --> 00:44:05,534
Hold on tight.

804
00:44:05,534 --> 00:44:06,604
Let's go!

805
00:44:17,615 --> 00:44:18,675
What...

806
00:44:20,545 --> 00:44:22,284
did I just see?

807
00:44:25,784 --> 00:44:29,295
No. They're just good friends.

808
00:44:30,224 --> 00:44:31,894
They're not dating.

809
00:44:34,295 --> 00:44:35,994
Dae Chung's in high school.

810
00:44:36,994 --> 00:44:38,965
He wouldn't date someone so old.

811
00:44:40,235 --> 00:44:41,534
He would never.

00:44:46,305 --> 00:44:51,914
(Sol Hair Salon)

813
00:44:53,684 --> 00:44:56,555
(Sol Hair Salon)

814
00:44:59,985 --> 00:45:02,854
Dae Chung. I had so much fun today.

815
00:45:03,454 --> 00:45:04,755
So did I, Jung Mi.

816
00:45:05,795 --> 00:45:06,994
You should go.

817
00:45:07,764 --> 00:45:09,564
Jung Mi. Sleep well.

818
00:45:09,564 --> 00:45:10,635
Sleep tight.

819
00:45:12,394 --> 00:45:13,505
Bye!

820
00:45:16,374 --> 00:45:17,405
Wait.

821
00:45:18,805 --> 00:45:20,045
Hey, Do Ra.

822
00:45:24,075 --> 00:45:26,184
- Did you just call me?
- Yes.

823
00:45:27,115 --> 00:45:28,345
What for?

824
00:45:29,314 --> 00:45:30,914
You came by this late
to get your hair done?

825
00:45:32,925 --> 00:45:35,624
Why are you glaring at me?

826
00:45:35,784 --> 00:45:38,624
Jung Mi. What's your relationship
with Dae Chung like?

827
00:45:39,025 --> 00:45:40,994
I saw everything, so be honest.

828
00:45:44,795 --> 00:45:47,334
Why should I tell you that?

829
00:45:48,005 --> 00:45:49,204
You're not...

830
00:45:49,575 --> 00:45:52,075
dating my Dae Chung
who's still in high school, are you?

831
00:45:52,334 --> 00:45:53,445
No, right?

832
00:45:54,704 --> 00:45:55,974
I don't believe this.

833
00:45:56,845 --> 00:45:59,784
Do Ra. A kid like you
doesn't need to know such things.

834
00:45:59,784 --> 00:46:01,144
I'm not a kid.

835
00:46:03,584 --> 00:46:05,084
You're so darn old.

836
00:46:05,925 --> 00:46:07,385
- What?
- How can you...

837
00:46:07,385 --> 00:46:09,224
ride behind Dae Chung
on his motorcycle?

838
00:46:09,624 --> 00:46:10,695
That's crazy.

839
00:46:10,994 --> 00:46:13,325
You shouldn't do that
with a high-school student.

840
00:46:13,925 --> 00:46:14,965
Do Ra.

841
00:46:15,525 --> 00:46:19,434
Age doesn't matter when it comes to
a couple's beautiful relationship.

842
00:46:21,204 --> 00:46:23,374
But then,
what would a kid like you know?

843
00:46:24,434 --> 00:46:28,974
Do Ra. Go home,
eat lots and lots, and grow up.

844
00:46:29,314 --> 00:46:31,474
Then you'll understand. Okay?

845
00:46:32,445 --> 00:46:33,545
You're so cute.

846
00:46:33,914 --> 00:46:35,385
You're adorable, Do Ra.

847
00:46:36,255 --> 00:46:37,255
Bye.

848
00:46:39,954 --> 00:46:40,985
Hello.

849
00:46:41,755 --> 00:46:43,425
I'm not a kid!

850
00:46:54,704 --> 00:46:55,735
Park Do Ra.

851
00:46:56,534 --> 00:46:57,834
What are you doing out here?

852
00:46:58,575 --> 00:47:01,905
Dae Chung. Does your mom know
what you're up to?

853
00:47:02,914 --> 00:47:06,514
What do you think I'm up to?

854
00:47:07,045 --> 00:47:08,784
I just got back
from studying all day.

855
00:47:09,684 --> 00:47:12,314
What? You're lying now too?

856
00:47:13,525 --> 00:47:16,624
You took old Jung Mi out
on the back of your motorcycle,

857
00:47:17,124 --> 00:47:18,155
and you studied all day?

858
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:22,735
Ms. Kim! Dae Chung...

859
00:47:22,735 --> 00:47:25,064
- has been going out to...
- No. Hush.

00:47:25,595 --> 00:47:28,465
(Young Mi Snacks)

861
00:47:40,385 --> 00:47:43,115
You swear there's nothing
between you and Jung Mi?

862
00:47:43,255 --> 00:47:44,684
I swear.

863
00:47:45,115 --> 00:47:46,885
We're just good friends.

864
00:47:48,624 --> 00:47:51,954
So you can't tell my mom, okay?

865
00:47:54,025 --> 00:47:55,095
I won't.

866
00:48:02,805 --> 00:48:05,704
You promised
you won't see her again.

867
00:48:06,374 --> 00:48:07,575
I won't.

868
00:48:07,575 --> 00:48:09,345
Or take her out on your motorcycle.

869
00:48:10,545 --> 00:48:11,545
Okay.

870
00:48:12,045 --> 00:48:14,014
A man can't go back on his word.

871
00:48:15,414 --> 00:48:17,985
Okay. I got it.

872
00:48:21,684 --> 00:48:22,954
Dae Chung.

873
00:48:24,025 --> 00:48:26,465
- What?
- You'll be a senior next year.

874
00:48:27,595 --> 00:48:30,095
You can't be out all the time
and not studying.

875
00:48:30,494 --> 00:48:32,195
Don't you worry about your future?

876
00:48:32,695 --> 00:48:34,235
How will you make a living?

877
00:48:35,064 --> 00:48:36,974
I'm saying this for your sake.

878
00:48:37,474 --> 00:48:40,374
Study hard from now on,
and come home early.

879
00:48:40,874 --> 00:48:41,905
Okay?

880
00:48:44,845 --> 00:48:47,045
Okay. I got your point.

881
00:48:47,385 --> 00:48:48,985
Stuff your face with tteokbokki.

882
00:48:49,045 --> 00:48:50,055
Okay.

883
00:49:03,664 --> 00:49:07,534
I think your secret's
way too big for me to keep it.

884
00:49:08,405 --> 00:49:10,474
A plate of tteokbokki won't cut it.

885
00:49:12,374 --> 00:49:13,474
What?

886
00:49:13,474 --> 00:49:14,905
You're a great dancer.

887
00:49:15,204 --> 00:49:17,244
Dance to Super Junior's
"Sorry, Sorry."

888
00:49:17,644 --> 00:49:19,414
Then I really won't tell anyone.

889
00:49:20,184 --> 00:49:21,414
What are you up to?

890
00:49:21,684 --> 00:49:23,914
You won't? Okay, then.

891
00:49:24,655 --> 00:49:26,724
I bet Ms. Kim's still awake.

892
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:27,755
Wait.

893
00:49:32,595 --> 00:49:34,025
<i>Sorry, sorry</i>

894
00:49:34,124 --> 00:49:36,764
<i>I fell for you</i>

895
00:49:40,534 --> 00:49:41,735
I'm so cool.

896
00:49:42,405 --> 00:49:43,405
Again.

897
00:49:55,715 --> 00:49:57,584
Here you go. Enjoy your meal.

898
00:49:57,584 --> 00:49:59,314
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

899
00:50:01,724 --> 00:50:03,854
- It's tasty.
- Yes.

900
00:50:03,854 --> 00:50:06,825
- The food here is good.
- It is.

901
00:50:10,534 --> 00:50:11,564
Sir.

902
00:50:11,865 --> 00:50:14,834
This is on the house.
Enjoy the extra food.

903
00:50:14,834 --> 00:50:16,534
- Thank you.
- Sure.

904
00:50:16,534 --> 00:50:19,075
Lady. One more soju.

905
00:50:19,434 --> 00:50:20,445
Okay.

906
00:50:20,675 --> 00:50:22,374
- What's going on?
- Just eat.

907
00:50:22,744 --> 00:50:24,014
Let's drink.

908
00:50:24,275 --> 00:50:26,314
- Here's your soju.
- You're so calm.

909
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:28,014
- Lady.
- Not like him.

910
00:50:28,014 --> 00:50:29,115
Pour me a drink.

911
00:50:30,385 --> 00:50:32,485
- What?
- Fill my glass.

912
00:50:35,525 --> 00:50:36,595
Sure.

913
00:50:43,735 --> 00:50:44,764
Lady.

914
00:50:46,164 --> 00:50:47,604
You look young.

915
00:50:47,604 --> 00:50:49,365
Stop. Will you let go?

916
00:50:49,365 --> 00:50:52,635
Don't act so pricey
when you work at a place like this.

917
00:50:52,905 --> 00:50:54,305
Yes, I'm pricey.

918
00:50:54,545 --> 00:50:56,414
If you want to
hold my hand, pay first.

919
00:50:56,474 --> 00:50:58,115
Do you think little of me
because I work here?

920
00:50:58,115 --> 00:51:00,644
- Let go!
- My gosh.

921
00:51:02,045 --> 00:51:04,184
- Let go.
- Who are you?

922
00:51:04,184 --> 00:51:05,555
What are you doing?

923
00:51:06,224 --> 00:51:08,255
Let go before I call the police.

924
00:51:09,084 --> 00:51:10,494
People are watching.

925
00:51:15,295 --> 00:51:17,994
Darn it. What rotten luck.

926
00:51:44,025 --> 00:51:45,894
It's cooked. Let's eat.

927
00:51:45,925 --> 00:51:47,164
At last.

928
00:52:01,075 --> 00:52:03,215
Gosh, it's hot!

929
00:52:03,215 --> 00:52:06,215
- It's hot!
- Oh, no. Do Jun.

930
00:52:06,215 --> 00:52:08,215
It's hot. It hurts.

931
00:52:08,215 --> 00:52:10,555
Does it hurt bad? What do I do?

932
00:52:12,014 --> 00:52:13,155
- Wait.
- It hurts.

933
00:52:15,555 --> 00:52:17,255
What do I do?

934
00:52:17,894 --> 00:52:18,894
Are you all right?

935
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:21,764
- It's hot.
- What should I do?

936
00:52:22,124 --> 00:52:24,664
- Do you think it's bad?
- Yes.

937
00:52:24,695 --> 00:52:26,764
- What should I do?
- What's going on?

938
00:52:27,005 --> 00:52:28,635
- What happened? What's this mess?
- It's hot.

939
00:52:28,635 --> 00:52:31,934
Mom, I cooked some ramyeon,
but I dropped the pot.

940
00:52:31,934 --> 00:52:35,505
It fell on Do Jun's foot.
It's not much. It's just a little.

941
00:52:35,505 --> 00:52:37,414
- Mom, what do I do?
- Mom.

942
00:52:37,414 --> 00:52:39,985
Mom. It hurts.

943
00:52:39,985 --> 00:52:42,045
I can't believe this.

944
00:52:42,144 --> 00:52:43,755
My goodness.

945
00:52:44,514 --> 00:52:46,354
- It hurts.
- Oh, no.

946
00:52:46,354 --> 00:52:49,224
This is driving me crazy.

947
00:52:50,155 --> 00:52:51,925
- Do Jun, let me see.
- Are you all right?

948
00:52:51,925 --> 00:52:54,124
- Mom.
- Let me take a look.

949
00:52:54,124 --> 00:52:56,025
Let me see. Oh, dear.

950
00:52:56,025 --> 00:52:58,295
- Mom.
- I can't believe this.

951
00:52:58,295 --> 00:53:00,305
- What should we do?
- Seriously...

952
00:53:00,305 --> 00:53:02,505
- Mom.
- This is crazy.

953
00:53:02,934 --> 00:53:05,474
- Mom.
- Oh, no.

954
00:53:05,474 --> 00:53:06,945
What's going on?

955
00:53:07,644 --> 00:53:08,805
What time do you think it is now?

956
00:53:08,805 --> 00:53:10,175
I told you to come home early...

957
00:53:10,175 --> 00:53:12,914
and take care of your brothers.

958
00:53:12,914 --> 00:53:14,684
Darn it!

959
00:53:15,184 --> 00:53:18,314
If this is how we live,
we should just go kill ourselves.

960
00:53:18,314 --> 00:53:21,325
What's the point of living?
It's just meaningless.

961
00:53:21,454 --> 00:53:24,755
Mom, I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

962
00:53:24,755 --> 00:53:26,825
I'll never come home late again.

963
00:53:26,825 --> 00:53:28,525
I'll take good care
of Do Sik and Do Jun.

964
00:53:28,525 --> 00:53:29,595
I'm sorry.

965
00:53:29,595 --> 00:53:30,994
I'm sorry, Mom.

966
00:53:30,994 --> 00:53:33,235
I will never cook ramyeon again.

967
00:53:33,235 --> 00:53:34,564
It's all my fault.

968
00:53:34,564 --> 00:53:36,505
I'm sorry, Mom.

969
00:53:36,505 --> 00:53:39,135
I'll never say I'm hungry again.

970
00:53:39,474 --> 00:53:42,845
I said I wanted to eat ramyeon.

971
00:53:45,414 --> 00:53:47,784
I'm the worst person ever.

972
00:53:47,784 --> 00:53:51,055
What if something happened
to you guys?

973
00:53:51,055 --> 00:53:54,385
How am I supposed to live
without you?

974
00:53:54,624 --> 00:53:56,394
I'm sorry, Mom.

975
00:53:56,394 --> 00:53:58,224
It won't happen again.

976
00:53:58,224 --> 00:54:01,195
- Mom.
- Get up, Mom.

977
00:54:01,195 --> 00:54:04,195
Get up. Please don't be like this.

978
00:54:04,195 --> 00:54:07,405
Mom, stop crying. I'm here for you.

979
00:54:10,005 --> 00:54:11,374
Mom.

980
00:54:14,974 --> 00:54:19,175
Mom. Please, Mom.

981
00:54:25,014 --> 00:54:26,215
Hey, Park Do Ra.

982
00:54:29,584 --> 00:54:30,595
Dae Chung.

983
00:54:31,994 --> 00:54:33,825
I'll give you a ride to school.

984
00:54:35,894 --> 00:54:36,894
Get on.

985
00:54:41,834 --> 00:54:44,974
Do Ra, hold tight.

986
00:54:44,974 --> 00:54:46,604
So you won't fall off.

987
00:54:47,445 --> 00:54:48,474
Okay.

988
00:54:56,454 --> 00:54:57,555
What is this?

989
00:54:58,385 --> 00:55:00,425
I think Dae Chung is my prince.

990
00:55:01,354 --> 00:55:03,354
Now that he gives me a ride,

991
00:55:03,354 --> 00:55:04,994
all the sad feelings...

992
00:55:04,994 --> 00:55:07,525
turn into this dazzling
pink color right away.

993
00:55:09,624 --> 00:55:12,235
Right. I'm sure he likes me too.

994
00:55:12,834 --> 00:55:14,834
That's why he waited for me
so early in the morning...

995
00:55:14,834 --> 00:55:16,305
to give me a ride.

996
00:55:17,474 --> 00:55:21,045
I will remember
our first date forever.

997
00:55:21,905 --> 00:55:24,314
Our love is bubbling.

998
00:55:38,894 --> 00:55:39,925
Mr. Kim.

999
00:55:39,925 --> 00:55:41,264
Yes.

1000
00:55:41,764 --> 00:55:44,434
Thank you for helping me yesterday.

1001
00:55:44,534 --> 00:55:45,595
Are you all right?

1002
00:55:45,595 --> 00:55:46,635
Yes.

1003
00:55:47,104 --> 00:55:48,305
Mr. Kim.

1004
00:55:48,305 --> 00:55:52,204
Please don't tell anyone
that I'm working there.

1005
00:55:52,334 --> 00:55:54,905
I understand.
You don't need to worry.

1006
00:55:56,244 --> 00:55:57,244
All right then.

1007
00:56:06,255 --> 00:56:08,284
- Dad.
- Hey.

1008
00:56:08,684 --> 00:56:10,555
What were you talking about
with Ms. Baek?

1009
00:56:10,555 --> 00:56:11,795
Nothing special.

1010
00:56:12,155 --> 00:56:13,795
- Is it coffee?
- Yes.

1011
00:56:15,325 --> 00:56:17,434
I added only half a spoonful
of sugar today.

1012
00:56:17,595 --> 00:56:20,604
It's not good for you
to eat too much sugar.

1013
00:56:20,635 --> 00:56:22,505
Why do you keep reducing it?

1014
00:56:22,635 --> 00:56:25,374
There's not much difference
between a spoon and a half spoon.

1015
00:56:28,805 --> 00:56:30,575
- It still tastes good, right?
- Yes.

1016
00:56:30,575 --> 00:56:32,845
The coffee I make
is the best in the world, right?

1017
00:56:33,314 --> 00:56:34,445
It's the best.

1018
00:57:16,485 --> 00:57:18,494
My gosh. Hey, Dae Chung.

1019
00:57:21,795 --> 00:57:23,195
I thought it was your car.

1020
00:57:23,195 --> 00:57:25,664
Are you here to meet my mom?

1021
00:57:26,235 --> 00:57:28,735
What are you doing here?
Why aren't you going in?

1022
00:57:28,965 --> 00:57:31,104
That's not why I'm here today.

1023
00:57:31,104 --> 00:57:33,275
I was in the neighborhood
to take care of something.

1024
00:57:33,275 --> 00:57:35,805
And I was getting a call.

1025
00:57:36,005 --> 00:57:37,215
I see.

1026
00:57:40,414 --> 00:57:42,985
Did you do well on the test?
You seem to be in a good mood.

1027
00:57:43,584 --> 00:57:45,684
It wasn't so bad.

1028
00:57:47,025 --> 00:57:49,684
By the way, how did you know
I had a test today?

1029
00:57:50,055 --> 00:57:53,025
What? I just thought you did.

1030
00:57:53,025 --> 00:57:55,325
It's exam season now.

1031
00:57:56,064 --> 00:57:57,795
Oh, right. Hang on a second.

1032
00:58:00,664 --> 00:58:01,735
Dae Chung.

1033
00:58:03,034 --> 00:58:05,934
Do you want this?
I think this will fit you.

1034
00:58:06,874 --> 00:58:08,244
What's this?

1035
00:58:08,704 --> 00:58:11,414
I got a sample,
and I thought it would fit you.

1036
00:58:12,514 --> 00:58:15,945
Ms. Jang, this brand
is so popular these days.

1037
00:58:15,945 --> 00:58:19,115
I've always wanted this,
but it's too expensive.

1038
00:58:19,115 --> 00:58:20,655
So I couldn't even ask Mom.

1039
00:58:21,525 --> 00:58:23,724
Ms. Jang, are you sure
I can take this?

1040
00:58:23,724 --> 00:58:25,095
Of course.

1041
00:58:25,095 --> 00:58:27,264
- Thank you.
- I'll be glad.

1042
00:58:27,425 --> 00:58:28,465
All right.

1043
00:58:32,635 --> 00:58:36,064
My gosh. This is a big one,

1044
00:58:36,064 --> 00:58:37,905
but it fits you already.

1045
00:58:38,334 --> 00:58:40,374
You've grown a lot, Dae Chung.

1046
00:58:41,374 --> 00:58:43,845
Do I look nice?

1047
00:58:44,075 --> 00:58:47,045
Yes. It looks great on you.
You look cool.

1048
00:58:47,485 --> 00:58:49,914
Ms. Jang. Thank you so much.

1049
00:58:49,914 --> 00:58:52,715
I will make sure to succeed
and return your favor.

1050
00:58:54,425 --> 00:58:56,584
It's no big deal. You don't have to.

1051
00:58:59,954 --> 00:59:02,295
Oh, right. I should get going then.

1052
00:59:02,295 --> 00:59:04,195
- Be safe on your way home.
- Thank you.

1053
00:59:04,195 --> 00:59:06,164
- Goodbye.
- See you.

1054
00:59:36,064 --> 00:59:37,195
Son.

1055
00:59:38,865 --> 00:59:39,865
My gosh.

1056
00:59:40,805 --> 00:59:41,965
What's that, Dae Chung?

1057
00:59:41,965 --> 00:59:43,934
Where did you get it?

1058
00:59:45,675 --> 00:59:46,805
What do you think?

1059
00:59:47,345 --> 00:59:49,575
Doesn't your son look cool?

1060
00:59:50,575 --> 00:59:53,115
This must be quite expensive.

1061
00:59:53,244 --> 00:59:55,945
This isn't something you can afford.

1062
00:59:56,854 --> 00:59:59,485
My gosh. This is new.

1063
01:00:00,655 --> 01:00:03,425
How did you get
this expensive jacket?

1064
01:00:03,894 --> 01:00:05,954
Be honest with me.

1065
01:00:05,954 --> 01:00:07,064
Don't tell me...

1066
01:00:10,095 --> 01:00:12,434
What negative thoughts
are you having?

1067
01:00:12,965 --> 01:00:15,034
Do you think I, Ko Dae Chung,

1068
01:00:15,034 --> 01:00:17,075
stole money
from your purse or something?

1069
01:00:17,974 --> 01:00:20,945
Ms. Jang got me this, you know.

1070
01:00:20,945 --> 01:00:23,514
What? Soo Yeon did?

1071
01:00:32,215 --> 01:00:33,985
Hi, Sun Young.

1072
01:00:34,284 --> 01:00:35,325
Soo Yeon.

1073
01:00:35,755 --> 01:00:39,124
Dae Chung says you were
in my neighborhood today.

1074
01:00:39,124 --> 01:00:41,095
Why did you not call me?

1075
01:00:41,425 --> 01:00:42,624
Well... Yes.

1076
01:00:43,164 --> 01:00:45,635
I was in your neighborhood
to take care of something,

1077
01:00:45,635 --> 01:00:48,005
and I stayed there for a while
to answer a call.

1078
01:00:48,005 --> 01:00:50,474
Dae Chung saw my car
and came to say hi to me.

1079
01:00:50,474 --> 01:00:52,374
I see.

1080
01:00:52,775 --> 01:00:55,405
Still, you shouldn't
just leave like that...

1081
01:00:55,405 --> 01:00:58,744
without seeing me
when you were in the neighborhood.

1082
01:00:59,814 --> 01:01:02,885
My husband is
coming home early today.

1083
01:01:03,385 --> 01:01:05,354
I'll make sure
to call you next time.

1084
01:01:05,354 --> 01:01:06,514
Okay.

1085
01:01:06,514 --> 01:01:10,295
By the way, you don't have to
give Dae Chung such a fancy jacket.

1086
01:01:10,295 --> 01:01:11,825
It will just spoil him.

1087
01:01:12,025 --> 01:01:13,865
Come on.

1088
01:01:13,865 --> 01:01:16,894
He isn't the kind of kid
who will get spoiled by things like that.

1089
01:01:17,834 --> 01:01:19,295
I got a sample,

1090
01:01:19,295 --> 01:01:21,564
but no one in my family
would wear it.

1091
01:01:22,135 --> 01:01:23,934
It's not like I have a son.

1092
01:01:23,934 --> 01:01:25,405
I ran into Dae Chung,

1093
01:01:25,405 --> 01:01:27,405
so I let him try it on,
and it fit him perfectly.

1094
01:01:30,005 --> 01:01:31,175
Does he...

1095
01:01:32,445 --> 01:01:33,885
like it?

1096
01:01:34,184 --> 01:01:35,615
Of course, he does.

1097
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:38,954
He got really excited
and had a fashion show of his own.

1098
01:01:39,184 --> 01:01:41,724
He says he can focus on his studies
thanks to the jacket.

1099
01:01:43,325 --> 01:01:44,494
Really?

1100
01:01:44,724 --> 01:01:47,325
I'm glad that he likes it.

1101
01:01:48,624 --> 01:01:51,064
All right, Sun Young.
I'll talk to you later.

1102
01:01:51,764 --> 01:01:52,865
Bye.

1103
01:02:11,485 --> 01:02:12,485
Mom.

1104
01:02:16,084 --> 01:02:18,255
Princess, you should've knocked.

1105
01:02:18,525 --> 01:02:19,555
Sorry.

1106
01:02:19,755 --> 01:02:21,494
- What were you up to?
- What?

1107
01:02:22,664 --> 01:02:23,865
Which photo were you looking at?

1108
01:02:24,595 --> 01:02:25,865
Was it mine?

1109
01:02:26,334 --> 01:02:28,735
That's right.
It was a photo of my princess.

1110
01:02:29,764 --> 01:02:31,874
Was it because
I'm pretty and adorable?

1111
01:02:33,175 --> 01:02:35,244
Yes, I was looking at your photo...

1112
01:02:36,604 --> 01:02:38,314
because you're beautiful.

1113
01:02:40,345 --> 01:02:42,115
My gorgeous Ma Ri.

1114
01:02:42,115 --> 01:02:44,014

1116
01:02:48,284 --> 01:02:50,755
- Bye.
- See you.

1117
01:03:04,104 --> 01:03:06,374
He danced for me
just because I asked.

1118
01:03:07,445 --> 01:03:08,905
He's super adorable...

1119
01:03:09,374 --> 01:03:10,445
and kind of dorky.

1120
01:03:25,224 --> 01:03:28,564
What... What am I seeing?

1121
01:03:36,505 --> 01:03:39,635
Sir, please go after that bike.

1122
01:03:40,034 --> 01:03:41,445
Right now!

1123
01:03:41,474 --> 01:03:43,604
Are you out of your mind?
I'm not your chauffeur.

1124
01:03:44,275 --> 01:03:46,615
- What?
- Take your seat or you'll get hurt.

1125
01:03:48,045 --> 01:03:49,084
I'm sorry.

1126
01:03:55,825 --> 01:03:57,394
He promised...

1127
01:03:58,295 --> 01:03:59,655
he wouldn't see her again.

1128
01:04:01,624 --> 01:04:03,025
How could this be?

1129
01:04:03,865 --> 01:04:05,595
How could he lie to me?

1130
01:04:09,064 --> 01:04:10,104
Just you wait.

1131
01:04:11,204 --> 01:04:12,474
You're going to pay.

1132
01:04:17,374 --> 01:04:18,814
Gosh, Do Ra.

1133
01:04:19,345 --> 01:04:21,184
What on earth are you saying?

1134
01:04:22,715 --> 01:04:26,014
You saw Dae Chung on a motorcycle
with a girl seated behind him?

1135
01:04:26,784 --> 01:04:29,925
Yes, and the girl
was way older than him.

1136
01:04:32,055 --> 01:04:34,425
You're being ridiculous.

1137
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:39,394
Do Ra, Dae Chung
doesn't own a motorcycle.

1138
01:04:40,064 --> 01:04:42,405
Besides, he doesn't even know
how to operate one.

1139
01:04:43,405 --> 01:04:46,704
Mothers of this world
are clueless about their children.

1140
01:04:47,644 --> 01:04:48,675
Well,

1141
01:04:48,974 --> 01:04:52,115
even my mom doesn't know
that I have feelings for Dae Chung.

1142
01:04:54,084 --> 01:04:57,354
Do Ra, what's going on?

1143
01:04:57,854 --> 01:04:58,954
What is this about?

1144
01:04:59,514 --> 01:05:03,454
Ms. Kim, what will you do
if I'm telling the truth?

1145
01:05:04,925 --> 01:05:07,394
How dare you get cheeky with me?

Dae Chung, good night.

1149
01:05:45,365 --> 01:05:46,365
Just a second.

1150
01:05:53,305 --> 01:05:55,275
Since we're enjoying
the first snow today...

1151
01:06:12,894 --> 01:06:13,894
You!

1152
01:06:16,164 --> 01:06:17,494
- Are you...
- What?

1153
01:06:17,494 --> 01:06:19,865
- What were you doing to my boy?
- Well...

1154
01:06:19,865 --> 01:06:22,465
- What on earth... Hey!
- You...

1155
01:06:23,534 --> 01:06:25,805
- Darn you.
- Hold on!

1156
01:06:26,635 --> 01:06:28,405
- How dare you?
- Stop it.

1157
01:06:28,405 --> 01:06:30,675
What do you think you're doing?

1158
01:06:30,744 --> 01:06:32,814
My son's still in high school.

1159
01:06:33,374 --> 01:06:36,045
Do you have any idea
what your niece was doing with him?

1160
01:06:36,045 --> 01:06:37,615
- How dare you?
- Mom!

1161
01:06:37,615 --> 01:06:40,215
Mom, stop it. That's enough.

1162
01:06:40,314 --> 01:06:41,655
You imbecile!

1163
01:06:41,655 --> 01:06:43,655
You! How dare you?

1164
01:06:44,124 --> 01:06:46,624
They have another thing coming.

1165
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,695
Hey!

1166
01:06:48,965 --> 01:06:49,994
No way.

1167
01:06:50,595 --> 01:06:52,064
Ms. Kim's a beast.

1168
01:06:52,994 --> 01:06:54,204
She's seeing red.

Ms. Baek,
what are you doing in here?

1174
01:08:16,845 --> 01:08:18,655
Were you stealing from us?

1175
01:08:18,655 --> 01:08:20,885
I don't live like this
because I want to!

1176
01:08:20,954 --> 01:08:25,354
Do you think I live this way
because I want to?

1177
01:08:25,595 --> 01:08:27,395
I see Mr. Kim
is highly accomplished.

1178
01:08:27,395 --> 01:08:29,095
He retired as a school principal...

1179
01:08:29,095 --> 01:08:30,734
which means he has money saved up.

1180
01:08:30,734 --> 01:08:32,435
And don't get me started
on his pension.

1181
01:08:32,435 --> 01:08:33,795
Who do you think
benefits from all that?

1182
01:08:33,795 --> 01:08:36,005
Mom, who are you
to keep us away from one another?

1183
01:08:36,065 --> 01:08:37,105
Why?

1184
01:08:39,034 --> 01:08:42,074
How dare you cause a scene
when you're merely a foundling?
