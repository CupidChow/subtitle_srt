00:00:00,107 --> 00:00:07,431
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:12,106 --> 00:00:13,165
Ji Young!

3
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,851
Don't leave me by myself
even if it's to go to the restroom.

4
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:26,721
Ji Young.

5
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:28,761
Ji Young?

6
00:00:32,461 --> 00:00:34,801
Ji Young, are you all right?

7
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,780
Ji Young, are you all right?

8
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,980
Mr. Ko, what about you?

9
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,511
I'm fine.

10
00:00:47,511 --> 00:00:48,950
Gosh, that was frightening.

11
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:51,950
This might be a hassle for you
since you're new to this.

12
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,621
Let's take a short break.

13
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:56,020
Let's get this off you.
Help her out of this.

14
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,660
(Episode 38)

15
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:09,071
What was that memory?

16
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:20,481
Ji Young, have some water.

17
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:32,591
I bet that startled you.

18
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,760
Are you sure you're okay?
Weren't you hurt?

19
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:39,301
Gosh. I'm good.

20
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,231
I wasn't hurt or anything.

21
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:45,400
I'm glad to hear that.

22
00:01:46,801 --> 00:01:47,870
Ji Young.

23
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,040
You seem to be in shock.

24
00:01:53,081 --> 00:01:54,210
It's not that.

25
00:01:57,111 --> 00:01:58,251
Actually,

26
00:01:58,981 --> 00:02:01,251
when I landed on the floor with you,

27
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,191
I think some memories came back.

28
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,591
Some memories?

29
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,091
Like what?

30
00:02:09,831 --> 00:02:14,031
Was there a time
when I was on some mountain trail...

31
00:02:14,031 --> 00:02:16,231
where I almost tripped while running,

32
00:02:16,631 --> 00:02:18,801
but you grabbed and saved me?

33
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,111
Yes, while shooting
"Straightforward Romance."

34
00:02:24,641 --> 00:02:26,141
"Straightforward Romance?"

35
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,551
- For real?
- Yes.

36
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,861
I'll go back inside and practice.

37
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,851
Director. Why are you still here?

38
00:03:07,881 --> 00:03:09,690
If it's all right with you,

39
00:03:10,321 --> 00:03:12,460
I'd like us to eat
at a place familiar to us...

40
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,831
so that I can tell you
about how you were as Do Ra.

41
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:20,131
In case it helps jog your memory.

42
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:24,301
What do you think? Is that okay?

43
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,280
Is this place unfamiliar?

44
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:37,881
Yes.

45
00:03:40,881 --> 00:03:42,520
I was an assistant director then,

46
00:03:43,421 --> 00:03:44,821
and Do Ra was a huge star.

47
00:03:45,821 --> 00:03:47,220
Do Ra said...

48
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:49,960
she hadn't eaten
at a food stall in a long time.

49
00:03:51,261 --> 00:03:53,530
She got excited over the hagfish
and pork belly cartilage.

50
00:03:53,631 --> 00:03:54,970
She loved this place.

51
00:03:56,101 --> 00:03:59,840
I said the hagfish
and pork belly cartilage excited me?

52
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,641
I said that?

53
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:04,740
You did.

54
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,011
Because Do Ra was such a huge star,

55
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,780
I guess she couldn't frequent...

56
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,351
places like this
in case she got noticed.

57
00:04:13,321 --> 00:04:16,851
A bowl of noodles and a shot of soju
made her so happy,

58
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:18,990
and I felt a bit sorry for her.

59
00:04:24,091 --> 00:04:26,760
That's what I was like?

60
00:04:31,101 --> 00:04:32,940
Then you don't remember
sticking a note...

61
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,240
on my back that said
"complete moron"...

62
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,541
after drinking here?

63
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,680
"Complete moron?"

64
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,580
I did that to you?

65
00:04:44,781 --> 00:04:48,791
How could I do
something like that to you?

66
00:04:51,961 --> 00:04:53,091
Are you lying?

67
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:55,630
Are you teasing me?

68
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,901
It's not a lie.

69
00:04:59,101 --> 00:05:00,901
You really did that.

70
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,000
I walked all the way home
from here...

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,401
with that huge note on my back,

72
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:08,240
and all my neighbors laughed at me.

73
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,471
Even my mom and grandma saw.

74
00:05:10,971 --> 00:05:12,940
Do you know
how embarrassing that was?

75
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,450
No way. That's impossible.

76
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,051
There's no way I'd do that to you.

77
00:05:19,051 --> 00:05:20,950
But you did.

78
00:05:22,551 --> 00:05:23,921
Okay, then.

79
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,560
When your memories come back,

80
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,830
how about you buy me a drink here?

81
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,161
Well, fine.

82
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,671
If my memories return
and you have told the truth,

83
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,771
I'll buy you two drinks.

84
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,541
Okay. Is that a promise?

85
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,310
Eat up before the noodles get soggy.

86
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,440
We have a lot to do after this.

87
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,481
Like what?

88
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:53,051
Today, trust me and follow my lead.

89
00:06:06,961 --> 00:06:08,200
Ji Young.

90
00:06:08,471 --> 00:06:10,471
How did you manage
to avoid this game until now?

91
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,070
You used to play this as Do Ra
when you were stressed.

92
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,841
You're much better
than you were then.

93
00:06:16,411 --> 00:06:19,010
This is a massive stress buster.

94
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:25,981
- Hey. You got it.
- Yes.

95
00:06:25,981 --> 00:06:27,551
- I got it.
- Yes.

96
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,161
I got you a plushie
from a claw machine back then.

97
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:37,130
Did you?

98
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,461
Don't you remember teasing me
that I could afford...

99
00:06:40,531 --> 00:06:43,171
a whole machine
with the money I spent?

100
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,901
I don't remember saying that.

101
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,510
But I see
you're not good at this at all.

102
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:53,481
I am good at this.

103
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:55,680
I can be if I really focus. Watch.

104
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:09,231
- Look. You got it.
- I got it.

105
00:07:09,231 --> 00:07:13,101
- I got it!
- You got it!

106
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,271
You got it.

107
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,901
Here. It's a gift.

108
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:25,041
My memories are still missing,

109
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,781
but I got a gift instead.

110
00:07:42,031 --> 00:07:43,231
Hey, you two.

111
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:45,430
What do you think you're doing?

112
00:07:49,531 --> 00:07:50,771
Ko Pil Seung.

113
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,801
What are you doing with my girl?

114
00:07:53,971 --> 00:07:56,240
Mr. Gong. It's not like that.

115
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,271
Kim Ji Young.

116
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,911
Are you dating us at the same time?

117
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:03,450
It's not that.

118
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,180
After my stunt training today,

119
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,151
we had stuff to talk about,
and that's what we did.

120
00:08:09,151 --> 00:08:10,651
Do you call that an excuse?

121
00:08:11,521 --> 00:08:13,021
If you had stunt training,

122
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:14,990
why would he bring you home?

123
00:08:15,591 --> 00:08:16,890
And why do you have a plushie?

124
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,661
Was that your stunt partner?

125
00:08:20,301 --> 00:08:23,370
That darn toy.
He gave it to you, didn't he?

126
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:26,200
Why do you even have it?

127
00:08:28,471 --> 00:08:29,940
What do you think you're doing?

128
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:31,440
Hey.

129
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,781
How dare you grab me like that?

130
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:36,781
Do you have a death wish?

131
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,680
Can you not do this?

132
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,980
Don't do this, Director. Don't.

133
00:08:42,251 --> 00:08:43,291
Ji Young.

134
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,950
Why are you dating a man like him?

135
00:08:45,521 --> 00:08:47,090
When will you finally stop
dating someone like him?

136
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,460
- I didn't think...
- Crazy about money...

137
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,060
How much did you get to do...

138
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,031
- Don't live like this.
- Don't show yourself again.

139
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:03,810
- Ji Young!
- Ji Young.

140
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,041
Oh, dear. What's wrong with her?

141
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,210
Ji Young.

142
00:09:08,651 --> 00:09:10,980
Are you two fighting over her?

143
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,151
Get away from her. Go away.

144
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,720
Darn you. Get lost, fool.

145
00:09:16,051 --> 00:09:18,860
- Leave.
- Why are you hitting just me?

146
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,860
- Get lost!
- Goodness.

147
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,090
- Ji Young.
- Stop it!

148
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:22,960
Are you all right?

149
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:34,570
Ji Young. What's wrong?

150
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,810
Let's go inside. Come on home.

151
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,411
My goodness.

152
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,180
Let's go. Come with me.

153
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,411
Please leave now.

154
00:09:43,881 --> 00:09:46,621
What's wrong with her?

155
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:00,960
Why do you live like this?

156
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,330
What kind of life did you lead?

157
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,041
Do whatever you want.

158
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:07,340
But...

159
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,340
don't show yourself again.

160
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,501
Why is the mean woman
taking so long...

161
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,930
just to get some medicine?

162
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:41,141
Hey.

163
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:45,281
Ji Young. What's the matter?

164
00:10:46,141 --> 00:10:47,141
My gosh.

165
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,881
Ji Young. What is it?

166
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,881
Grandma.

167
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:53,651
Oh, dear.

168
00:10:55,151 --> 00:10:56,450
Grandma.

169
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,421
Oh, my gosh.

170
00:10:59,421 --> 00:11:00,720
You poor thing.

171
00:11:02,031 --> 00:11:04,060
- What's going on?
- Grandma.

172
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,501
Yes. It's okay.

173
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,261
Grandma.

174
00:11:11,531 --> 00:11:14,340
- Grandma.
- Oh, Ji Young.

175
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:22,281
About my divorce with Soo Yeon.

176
00:11:23,511 --> 00:11:25,180
I take it back.

177
00:11:29,551 --> 00:11:32,560
What are you talking about?

178
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,531
Is something wrong with your head?

179
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,631
You take back the divorce?

180
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,470
Yes. I called the lawyer
and canceled the suit.

181
00:11:43,131 --> 00:11:44,200
Goodness.

182
00:11:45,001 --> 00:11:46,171
So are you saying...

183
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:50,241
you will stay married to her
as if nothing happened?

184
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,180
I mean, she gave birth...

185
00:11:53,641 --> 00:11:56,411
to someone else's child
and hid it for a long time.

186
00:11:56,411 --> 00:11:59,921
She fooled you
and deceived all our family.

187
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,051
I'm aware
that Soo Yeon did us a great wrong.

188
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:07,891
But I'm going to forgive her.

189
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:11,860
I want you to keep that in mind.

190
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,450
What's wrong with Jin Taek?

191
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,051
He will forgive her?

192
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,521
Is this something
that can be forgiven?

193
00:12:36,751 --> 00:12:39,190
Auntie, can you believe this?

194
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:43,360
Now he will want to cancel his plan
to adopt Jin Dan on paper.

195
00:12:48,261 --> 00:12:49,330
Chairman Gong.

196
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,970
What about the adoption?

197
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,641
I mean, adopting Jin Dan on paper.

198
00:12:56,011 --> 00:12:57,210
Auntie.

199
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,340
Fine.

200
00:12:59,281 --> 00:13:00,610
I can't help it...

201
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,411
if you want to get back together
with Soo Yeon.

202
00:13:02,511 --> 00:13:05,651
Whatever she did wrong,
it's fine as long as you want her back.

203
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,480
But if you...

204
00:13:09,151 --> 00:13:11,991
hesitate to adopt Jin Dan,

205
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,421
I swear I won't let it slide.

206
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,330
That's right. There you go, Auntie.

207
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:21,600
Auntie, the adoption issue...

208
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,871
isn't just about our family.

209
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:25,600
It is a plan...

210
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,141
that can affect my company
for decades to come.

211
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,710
So even if it takes some time,

212
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,210
I need to think carefully
before making any decision.

213
00:13:33,241 --> 00:13:34,940
So are you saying...

214
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,350
you are still working on it?

215
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,651
Yes. I'm thinking about it.

216
00:13:40,651 --> 00:13:43,950
And I need to discuss it
with my wife.

217
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,960
What did you say? Discuss?

218
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:49,930
Why would you bring up
that immoral thing here?

219
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,330
My wife and I will be
adopting Jin Dan on paper.

220
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,970
Of course,
I should discuss it with her.

221
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,671
What... What did you say?

222
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,911
My gosh. Actually, he has a point.

223
00:14:03,141 --> 00:14:05,381
If Chairman Gong adopts Jin Dan,

224
00:14:05,381 --> 00:14:06,940
that means he will be
Soo Yeon's son...

225
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,511
since they are not getting divorced.

226
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,651
I can't believe this.

227
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,121
No. Being his adopted son
would still be better.

228
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,791
I have to make it happen.

229
00:14:22,031 --> 00:14:25,190
That's the only option
Jin Dan and I have left.

230
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,651
Ms. Baek was right.

231
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,860
I died because of Director Ko.

232
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:29,060
I had no idea.

233
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,830
I fell for him again like a fool.

234
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,730
I missed him and gave him my heart.

235
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:38,901
Director Ko is...

236
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,241
such a horrible person.

237
00:15:44,271 --> 00:15:46,480
How could he shake me up
like this again...

238
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,411
after all he did to me?

239
00:16:24,381 --> 00:16:25,381
Ji Young.

240
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:28,551
I actually thought
about giving you a call...

241
00:16:29,051 --> 00:16:30,690
over and over again.

242
00:16:33,261 --> 00:16:34,860
You regained another memory,
didn't you?

243
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,360
What did you remember?

244
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,600
That's right.

245
00:16:45,131 --> 00:16:46,771
I regained another memory.

246
00:16:50,911 --> 00:16:53,911
The reason
you kept saying sorry to me.

247
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,450
I regained the memory...

248
00:16:58,881 --> 00:16:59,980
of that day.

249
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:12,701
Ji Young.

250
00:17:14,431 --> 00:17:15,731
On the day I died,

251
00:17:17,201 --> 00:17:19,140
I went to see you.

252
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,100
Didn't I?

253
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:27,110
I asked you to trust me.

254
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,481
Even if the whole world
got me wrong,

255
00:17:33,481 --> 00:17:36,021
I just wanted you to trust me.

256
00:17:39,021 --> 00:17:40,961
I asked you desperately,

257
00:17:42,191 --> 00:17:44,160
but you turned away from me.

258
00:17:47,731 --> 00:17:49,231
Do I remember it...

259
00:17:51,731 --> 00:17:52,741
correctly?

260
00:17:56,471 --> 00:17:57,471
Yes.

261
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,041
That's true.

262
00:18:05,281 --> 00:18:06,420
That's what happened.

263
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,060
Why did you not hold
my hand back then?

264
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:16,691
When I was desperate
to grasp at straws,

265
00:18:16,691 --> 00:18:18,691
why did you break my heart
like that?

266
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,170
I'm not here
to ask you all these questions.

267
00:18:24,801 --> 00:18:27,741
I don't even want
to hate you anymore.

268
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,271
I want to stop thinking
that you are a bad person.

269
00:18:32,981 --> 00:18:35,281
I'm living as Kim Ji Young now.

270
00:18:36,051 --> 00:18:38,751
Why would I blame you
for what you did back then?

271
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,620
What's the point of doing all that?

272
00:18:46,261 --> 00:18:48,261
I just came to see you...

273
00:18:49,431 --> 00:18:50,491
because...

274
00:18:52,191 --> 00:18:55,461
I wanted to end things
with you right here.

275
00:18:57,471 --> 00:18:58,471
Director Ko.

276
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:03,370
Let's not have our personal feelings
come into play anymore.

277
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:06,781
To be honest,

278
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,181
the good memories of you
did shake me up.

279
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,051
But now,

280
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,691
I remember
how heartless you were to me...

281
00:19:27,461 --> 00:19:29,001
and how you abandoned me,

282
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,140
so I can't have feelings
for you anymore.

283
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:39,610
Now I know who you really are.

284
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:43,781
Ji Young.

285
00:19:47,781 --> 00:19:49,120
I will get going then.

286
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,620
I'm going to invite
CEO Ko Pil Seung over...

287
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,289
for dinner tonight.

288
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:24,090
Who?

289
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,200
Who will you invite?

290
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,870
CEO Ko helped Ma Ri
get better a lot...

291
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:31,140
as her older brother.

292
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,200
What did you say?
Ma Ri's older brother?

293
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:36,940
So are you saying...

294
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:42,079
this thing had someone else's son
and hid it from you for years,

295
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:44,819
but you will acknowledge him
as Ma Ri's brother?

296
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,420
Auntie, please watch your words
around Ma Ri.

297
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,989
Chairman Gong,
what is the matter with you?

298
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:56,729
I can overlook your decision
to cancel the divorce,

299
00:20:57,559 --> 00:20:59,400
but not this.

300
00:20:59,499 --> 00:21:03,029
Great Auntie, why is that?
Pil Seung's my brother.

301
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:06,469
What's wrong with my brother
having dinner at our house?

302
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,969
Ma Ri, please.

303
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,840
Of course. I saw this coming.

304
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,549
I knew this would ruin our family.

305
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,249
I have plans for dinner,

306
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,380
so invite him over for all I care.

307
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,719
I have plans for dinner too.

308
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,630
I'm off to the office.

309
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,840
Honey, why would you suggest that?

310
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:46,910
You shouldn't have
without discussing it with me first.

311
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,779
Why do I need to discuss...

312
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:50,910
inviting a guest over
to my own house?

313
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:54,920
Just make sure
to cook a decent meal...

314
00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:56,950
and don't be concerned
with the others.

315
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:00,160
Dad, you really are the best.

316
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,259
The best.

317
00:22:02,229 --> 00:22:06,299
You saying I'm cool
makes me feel smug.

318
00:22:07,729 --> 00:22:09,529
Dig in, then.

319
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,809
(CEO Ko Pil Seung)

320
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,819
I remember
how heartless you were to me...

321
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,829
and how you abandoned me,

322
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:39,160
so I can't have feelings
for you anymore.

323
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:45,700
Now I know who you really are.

324
00:22:58,079 --> 00:22:59,150
Yes, Chairman Gong.

325
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:02,190
Director Ko,
are you free this evening?

326
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:04,759
This evening?

327
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,029
Yes, I don't have any other plans.

328
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,430
I'm glad to hear that.

329
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,729
I'd like to invite you over
for dinner today.

330
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,059
Can you be there?

331
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,430
At your house?

332
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:19,769
Sure thing.

333
00:23:39,219 --> 00:23:41,789
Ma Ri, hold on to me tight.

334
00:23:46,999 --> 00:23:48,029
Hold tight.

335
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:04,049
How was Do Jun able
to carry me like that?

336
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:07,420
He's super strong.

337
00:24:15,259 --> 00:24:18,660
Why is my heart suddenly pounding?

338
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,120
Hey, Ma Ri.

339
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:45,960
What are you doing out here,

340
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,489
and why were you peeping?

341
00:24:48,729 --> 00:24:49,829
You're wrong.

342
00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:53,499
I wasn't peeping but just looking.

343
00:24:54,999 --> 00:24:57,670
I see. Were you headed out?

344
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,400
No.

345
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,769
Well... Do Jun.

346
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:05,710
Do you want to play badminton?

347
00:25:06,979 --> 00:25:08,079
Badminton?

348
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,469
Ma Ri, come on.
Why are you spacing out?

349
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:34,969
What?

350
00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:37,440
Oh, well...

351
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,539
I had my eyes on the shuttlecock.

352
00:25:41,979 --> 00:25:43,479
When did it land here?

353
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,600
Ma Ri!

354
00:25:59,729 --> 00:26:00,729
Ma Ri, are you okay?

355
00:26:01,569 --> 00:26:03,670
I don't think I am.

356
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:05,400
Oh, no.

357
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,700
Grab my hands and try to stand.

358
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,610
Are you okay? Does it hurt a lot?

359
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,410
Do you think you can walk?

360
00:26:16,579 --> 00:26:18,380
No, I can't.

361
00:26:18,979 --> 00:26:20,279
Do Jun, it seems...

362
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:23,489
as though you'll have to carry me
like last time.

363
00:26:24,219 --> 00:26:25,559
Sure thing. Hold on.

364
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:31,400
I just hope it's nothing serious.

365
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,940
Do Jun, I'm fine now,
so you can put me down.

366
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,769
But it hurts for you to walk.

367
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,969
I know this is uncomfortable,
but hold on. We're almost home.

368
00:26:43,009 --> 00:26:45,809
You can put me down now.
I think I'll be fine.

369
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,180
I'm all right.

370
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:50,579
I'm worried, that's all.
You look exhausted.

371
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:52,819
I feel better now,
so I can probably walk.

372
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:56,249
All right.

373
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:04,160
How can your foot
already be back to normal?

374
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,960
What? That's right.

375
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,700
It's perfectly fine.

376
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:11,840
You weren't even able
to stand properly,

377
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,069
so how can your foot
be as good as new?

378
00:27:15,309 --> 00:27:18,640
Did you lie about being hurt
when you weren't?

379
00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:20,340
What?

380
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,279
Yes, that's right.

381
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,650
It was a lie.

382
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:28,789
I'm sorry!

383
00:27:29,249 --> 00:27:30,289
What?

384
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,559
Gosh, Director Ko.

385
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,130
Sorry. I mean, CEO Ko. Welcome.

386
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,469
Here.

387
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:51,140
You didn't have to get us anything.

388
00:27:52,239 --> 00:27:53,809
But Ma Ri loves cake.

389
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:56,809
Thank you.

390
00:27:58,749 --> 00:27:59,850
Pil Seung!

391
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:01,590
Ma Ri, be careful.

392
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,489
Pil Seung, welcome.
I missed you so much.

393
00:28:03,489 --> 00:28:04,860
I'm thrilled to have you here.

394
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,860
- Have you been well, Ma Ri?
- Yes.

395
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:10,890
You never hug me when I get home,

396
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:12,559
so how come he gets one?

397
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,600
You'll only make me jealous.

398
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,049
How is it?
Does the food suit your palate?

399
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,450
Yes, everything's good.

400
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:32,579
I'm glad.

401
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,219
Pil Seung, isn't this delicious?

402
00:28:35,219 --> 00:28:36,519
Mom made that.

403
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,559
Right. It's tasty.

404
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:45,999
Dad, try to answer this.

405
00:28:45,999 --> 00:28:48,769
You can call yourself a genius
if you get it right.

406
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,370
Bring it on.

407
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,700
I'll prove to you that I'm a genius.

408
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:54,739
Here you go.

409
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:58,910
What do you call the poop
from someone hanging off a cliff?

410
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:03,350
A cliff and poop? What?

411
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:06,420
Ma Ri, must you do that
when we're trying to eat?

412
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,049
Mom, please.

413
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,450
Pil Seung, you keep quiet too.

414
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:12,259
I wonder what you're getting at.

415
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:13,420
Honey, do you know the answer?

416
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,190
Pooping till you make it.

417
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:19,100
I know! Pooping till you make it.

418
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:24,229
You can't give him the answer.
That's cheating.

419
00:29:24,469 --> 00:29:26,769
Then I'll ask one
Mom doesn't know the answer to.

420
00:29:27,069 --> 00:29:28,739
Well...

421
00:29:31,509 --> 00:29:35,410
What's a chicken that died
because it was impatient?

422
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,120
What? A chicken died
because it was impatient?

423
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,450
What's that? Can that even happen?

424
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,519
- It's a brain teaser.
- Of course.

425
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:47,019
CEO Ko, you must know the answer.
Help me out here.

426
00:29:47,489 --> 00:29:50,190
- I don't know the answer to that.
- Goodness.

427
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,930
How can you not know this?

428
00:29:52,029 --> 00:29:54,729
A chicken that died
because it was impatient.

429
00:29:54,729 --> 00:29:55,729
Yes?

430
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,200
It clucked to its death.

431
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,469
My gosh!

432
00:29:59,269 --> 00:30:00,700
It clucked to its death?

433
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:04,739
Auntie, Chairman Gong
must be out of his mind.

434
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,680
There can't be a man
more stupid than that.

435
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:09,579
Unbelievable.

436
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:23,759
CEO Ko, I asked to see you
because I had something to say.

437
00:30:24,999 --> 00:30:26,059
Go ahead.

438
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,469
I know Soo Yeon's actions
hurt you...

439
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,499
as much as they hurt me.

440
00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:36,610
It wasn't easy...

441
00:30:37,809 --> 00:30:41,340
for me to accept her
back into my life.

442
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:46,120
But then I thought of the years
we had spent together...

443
00:30:46,479 --> 00:30:47,719
and also Ma Ri.

444
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:51,289
That's why I decided
to take her back.

445
00:30:53,489 --> 00:30:55,029
I see.

446
00:30:56,329 --> 00:30:58,860
Please don't hesitate
to visit Ma Ri...

447
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,460
whenever you want.

448
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,400
That's what I wanted to say.

449
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:07,900
I see. I appreciate the offer.

450
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,440
I had a blast today.

451
00:31:18,579 --> 00:31:19,850
- Honey.
- Yes?

452
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:21,789
Take your medicine.

453
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:23,690
You still need it
even though you removed the cast.

454
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,090
Right. Thanks.

455
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,569
Honey, thank you...

456
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,340
for today.

457
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,009
And I'm sorry.

458
00:31:45,809 --> 00:31:47,809
Why are you apologizing?

459
00:31:49,009 --> 00:31:52,319
Thanks to Pil Seung,
Ma Ri got better.

460
00:31:54,249 --> 00:31:57,489
When we had him over for dinner,

461
00:31:58,759 --> 00:32:00,960
I saw how much
Ma Ri was fond of him.

462
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,229
The house didn't feel as empty.

463
00:32:04,999 --> 00:32:08,370
Anyway, he's a reliable
and dependable man.

464
00:32:09,499 --> 00:32:10,900
Right.

465
00:32:11,969 --> 00:32:15,940
The more I see him,
the more I want him in my life.

466
00:32:17,069 --> 00:32:20,610
I even think about
how it would've been...

467
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,509
to have him as a son.

468
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,219
Honey, why...

469
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,819
There's no need to be startled.

470
00:32:27,819 --> 00:32:29,549
I'm just telling you how I feel.

471
00:32:30,819 --> 00:32:32,890
It was a silly remark, that's all.

472
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,090
I'll wash up.

473
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,769
- I'm home.
- It's too sweet.

474
00:32:46,499 --> 00:32:48,200
- Hey, Pil Seung.
- You're home.

475
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:49,870
Did you have fun?

476
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,440
How is Ma Ri doing?

477
00:32:51,979 --> 00:32:54,309
She's doing better now
and is eating properly.

478
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,350
I'm glad to hear that.

479
00:32:58,049 --> 00:32:59,049
Pil Seung.

480
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:03,289
What does a family like theirs eat?

481
00:33:05,219 --> 00:33:08,190
Fish, grilled abalone,
salted pollack roe, roasted laver,

482
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:10,090
bulgogi, tofu stew,
and things like that.

483
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,259
That's pretty much
like what we also eat.

484
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:14,499
I thought wealthy families
ate something special.

485
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:16,430
Of course, they eat the same things.

486
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:18,069
Why would the food be any different?

487
00:33:18,069 --> 00:33:19,870
- Gosh.
- Hey.

488
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:21,299
How can it be the same?

489
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,469
Not all fish are the same.

490
00:33:23,469 --> 00:33:26,680
I doubt they served him mackerel
or saury like we eat at home.

491
00:33:26,739 --> 00:33:30,249
Families like that probably eat
croaker or tilefish.

492
00:33:30,249 --> 00:33:33,450
I bet the premium beef
was used to make bulgogi as well.

493
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:35,289
By the way,

494
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,890
didn't Chairman Gong
say anything to you?

495
00:33:39,489 --> 00:33:42,630
Did he only invite you over
for dinner?

496
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:47,160
He said I should come by
at any time to see Ma Ri.

497
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:51,900
Pil Seung, you must be tired,
so head upstairs to rest.

498
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,440
Sure. I'll head to my room.

499
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,769
- Sure. Get some rest.
- Right.

500
00:33:55,769 --> 00:33:57,610
This means...

501
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,239
that Chairman Gong...

502
00:34:00,239 --> 00:34:02,380
has acknowledged Pil Seung
as Ma Ri's brother.

503
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:05,120
I thought it was
a friendly dinner...

504
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,549
to thank him
for helping Ma Ri recently.

505
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:12,620
What if the chairman...

506
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,719
is considering Pil Seung
as his stepson?

507
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,289
His stepson, you say?

508
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:19,729
Pil Seung is my son, not his.

509
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,499
No one said otherwise.

510
00:34:21,499 --> 00:34:23,630
I never said he wasn't your son.

511
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:27,840
Anyway, I'm glad they aren't
going ahead with the divorce.

512
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,710
That is great for Pil Seung as well.

513
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,309
What are you going on about?

514
00:34:33,309 --> 00:34:36,510
Them divorcing or not
has nothing to do with Pil Seung.

515
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:39,119
Of course, it matters to him.

516
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,880
Blood is thicker than water.

517
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,949
If not, how could Pil Seung...

518
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:46,420
have moved high up the ladder
landing a job as CEO?

519
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:49,460
They considered Pil Seung
for a reason.

520
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:53,199
Pil Seung only got the job
because he deserved it.

521
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,970
Would you stop it
with that nonsense?

522
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:58,269
I'm only letting you speak
because you're my mom.

523
00:34:58,269 --> 00:35:01,269
If the lady next door had said that,
I would've caused a scene.

524
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:03,570
Mom, I think Sun Young
and Hyun Chul...

525
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:07,039
are on edge with Pil Seung
being invited over to that house.

526
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:08,979
It's like they're sharing a son
with them.

527
00:35:08,979 --> 00:35:11,280
That would bug me as well.

528
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:13,019
What's there to be bothered about?

529
00:35:13,019 --> 00:35:16,190
I'd dance on my feet
and celebrate our luck.

530
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:18,720
A wealthy chairman
has acknowledged Pil Seung...

531
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,789
as Ma Ri's brother.

532
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:24,960
Pil Seung's future will only be
of sunshine and rainbows now.

533
00:35:25,929 --> 00:35:28,929
It's not like they want
half of Pil Seung,

534
00:35:28,929 --> 00:35:30,970
so why are you on edge about it?

535
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:36,496
Ma Ri.

536
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,761
Do you know how worried I was
about the state of your injury?

537
00:35:40,662 --> 00:35:42,732
I carried you home worried sick.

538
00:35:43,491 --> 00:35:45,062
Why would you lie
about something like that?

539
00:35:46,332 --> 00:35:48,901
I know I'm only
your driver and bodyguard,

540
00:35:49,332 --> 00:35:50,971
but I get furious
the more I think about it.

541
00:35:51,841 --> 00:35:53,542
Are you angry?

542
00:35:54,372 --> 00:35:55,511
I'm sorry, Do Jun.

543
00:35:55,511 --> 00:35:59,511
All I wanted was for you to carry me.

544
00:36:00,011 --> 00:36:02,551
I was reminded
of how you held me tight...

545
00:36:02,551 --> 00:36:05,582
when I was upset and sick.

546
00:36:06,051 --> 00:36:07,491
That's all.

547
00:36:08,951 --> 00:36:12,261
Why didn't you just tell me that?

548
00:36:13,662 --> 00:36:17,631
Would you have held me tight...

549
00:36:17,631 --> 00:36:19,162
if I had requested it?

550
00:36:20,571 --> 00:36:21,571
What?

551
00:36:21,631 --> 00:36:23,732
See? You wouldn't have.

552
00:36:23,732 --> 00:36:25,102
That's why I lied.

553
00:36:26,672 --> 00:36:27,712
But...

554
00:36:29,942 --> 00:36:31,741
Why do you want me
to hold you tight?

555
00:36:32,511 --> 00:36:34,611
What? Well...

556
00:36:39,582 --> 00:36:43,422
Do you have to know why?

557
00:36:45,261 --> 00:36:46,261
Yes.

558
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:49,892
Well...

559
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:56,272
It seems that I like you.

560
00:36:57,542 --> 00:36:58,542
What?

561
00:36:59,772 --> 00:37:02,042
As if you didn't hear me.
I think I have feelings for you!

562
00:37:02,042 --> 00:37:03,272
Whatever!

563
00:37:12,852 --> 00:37:14,622
What do you think, Director Ko?
Hasn't she improved?

564
00:37:14,721 --> 00:37:16,151
That she has.

565
00:37:16,292 --> 00:37:17,861
Ji Young, you did great.

566
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:19,321
I don't think you need
any more classes.

567
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:21,962
Really? Thanks for saying so.

568
00:37:34,241 --> 00:37:36,372
Ji Young, take this umbrella.

569
00:37:36,372 --> 00:37:37,442
It's pouring.

570
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:41,082
It's all right.

571
00:37:42,252 --> 00:37:43,651
I'll get going.

572
00:38:12,741 --> 00:38:13,741
Do Ra,

573
00:38:13,982 --> 00:38:15,651
have some of this shrimp.

574
00:38:15,781 --> 00:38:16,812
It's delicious.

575
00:38:19,181 --> 00:38:20,221
Goodness.

576
00:38:21,352 --> 00:38:22,951
I see.

577
00:38:23,221 --> 00:38:25,221
I'm your biggest fan, that's why.

578
00:38:25,861 --> 00:38:27,591
Come to me
if anyone gives you a hard time.

579
00:38:27,591 --> 00:38:28,591
I'll...

580
00:38:29,562 --> 00:38:30,631
handle them for you.

581
00:38:38,071 --> 00:38:39,872
What am I remembering?

582
00:38:47,011 --> 00:38:48,881
Ms. Baek was right.

583
00:38:50,752 --> 00:38:53,151
Mr. Gong's feelings for me
have been genuine.

584
00:38:54,852 --> 00:38:56,522
Because I couldn't remember,

585
00:38:57,422 --> 00:39:00,361
I got the wrong idea about the one
who was devoted to me...

586
00:39:02,392 --> 00:39:03,832
and tried to dismiss him.

587
00:39:15,212 --> 00:39:19,812
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

588
00:39:26,122 --> 00:39:27,422
(Kim Ji Young)

589
00:39:27,651 --> 00:39:29,892
Why is this woman calling me?

590
00:39:31,062 --> 00:39:32,922
Why not call Ko Pil Seung instead?

591
00:39:40,502 --> 00:39:41,502
Hello?

592
00:39:43,301 --> 00:39:44,372
Hey.

593
00:39:44,602 --> 00:39:46,471
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

594
00:39:46,872 --> 00:39:47,942
What do you want?

595
00:39:49,571 --> 00:39:51,341
Why would you call me?

596
00:39:55,951 --> 00:39:57,011
This evening?

597
00:39:57,752 --> 00:39:59,051
I don't have any plans.

598
00:39:59,781 --> 00:40:01,892
My grandmother
is making dumplings today.

599
00:40:01,991 --> 00:40:04,022
Do you want to come over
for dumpling soup?

600
00:40:07,062 --> 00:40:08,792
Okay, I'll be there.

601
00:40:09,761 --> 00:40:10,832
Bye.

602
00:40:17,232 --> 00:40:20,372
What made her invite me
for dumpling soup?

603
00:40:22,872 --> 00:40:26,011
The new drama "Seoul Lady,"
directed by Ko Pil Seung...

604
00:40:26,011 --> 00:40:28,412
- and written by Kim Oh Kyeong...
- My goodness.

605
00:40:28,412 --> 00:40:31,082
The country bumpkin
that lived with us...

606
00:40:31,082 --> 00:40:32,852
- will play the lead?
- Actor Kang Bin.

607
00:40:33,221 --> 00:40:36,192
The female lead
is rising star Kim Ji Young.

608
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:40,122
Viewers are excited
about the great cast.

609
00:40:40,562 --> 00:40:43,431
- The female lead Kim Ji Young...
- Darn it.

610
00:40:43,491 --> 00:40:45,401
Who cares about that brat?

611
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,571
She did amazingly well
in her previous drama...

612
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:52,241
Hey. Why did you turn off the TV?

613
00:40:52,841 --> 00:40:56,872
I was watching the report
on Pil Seung's new drama!

614
00:40:56,942 --> 00:40:58,611
Darn her.

615
00:41:02,151 --> 00:41:05,221
Myung Dong, give me five minutes.
No, just one will do.

616
00:41:05,221 --> 00:41:06,482
Hear me out.

617
00:41:06,482 --> 00:41:08,252
Get out of my way.

618
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:12,162
You would've gotten the wrong idea
if you saw me with Ji Young.

619
00:41:12,821 --> 00:41:13,991
But Myung Dong,

620
00:41:14,732 --> 00:41:17,431
Ji Young is my sister Do Ra.
Park Do Ra.

621
00:41:20,931 --> 00:41:21,971
What?

622
00:41:25,071 --> 00:41:28,142
She lost her memory
and got a new look in the accident.

623
00:41:28,341 --> 00:41:30,741
Ji Young had no idea
she was actually Do Ra.

624
00:41:32,712 --> 00:41:37,082
Did you figure everything out
with a DNA test?

625
00:41:38,852 --> 00:41:41,622
But you know
the world can't know who she is.

626
00:41:42,091 --> 00:41:43,951
She decided to remain Kim Ji Young.

627
00:41:44,221 --> 00:41:46,261
We call her that now too.
We don't call her Do Ra.

628
00:41:47,562 --> 00:41:50,232
My gosh. How could that be?

629
00:41:52,002 --> 00:41:53,901
That's impossible.

630
00:41:54,801 --> 00:41:56,672
If you don't believe me,
ask Pil Seung.

631
00:41:56,672 --> 00:41:57,672
It's the truth.

632
00:41:58,272 --> 00:41:59,672
Pil Seung knows too?

633
00:42:06,241 --> 00:42:08,011
(Sang Soon)

634
00:42:10,852 --> 00:42:11,982
Hi, Sang Gu.

635
00:42:12,951 --> 00:42:14,622
Did you land in the Philippines?

636
00:42:15,451 --> 00:42:18,162
No. I haven't left Seoul yet.

637
00:42:18,562 --> 00:42:21,332
What? You're still here?

638
00:42:22,131 --> 00:42:25,301
You agreed to go to the Philippines.
Why are you still here?

639
00:42:26,162 --> 00:42:27,531
What's up with you?

640
00:42:28,002 --> 00:42:30,602
I even gave you money
to spend in the Philippines.

641
00:42:30,602 --> 00:42:32,471
Why are you still here?

642
00:42:32,701 --> 00:42:35,812
Ae Kyo.
I don't care about that right now.

643
00:42:36,372 --> 00:42:37,781
Tell me the truth.

644
00:42:38,982 --> 00:42:41,451
Your son Jin Dan.
He's mine, isn't he?

645
00:42:42,281 --> 00:42:44,221
What?

646
00:42:45,082 --> 00:42:46,951
Why would you say such nonsense?

647
00:42:47,051 --> 00:42:48,622
I said you were wrong.

648
00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:50,852
Is he really not my son?
Are you sure?

649
00:42:50,892 --> 00:42:52,192
What's wrong with you?

650
00:42:52,422 --> 00:42:54,431
How dare you
try to link my son with you?

651
00:42:54,562 --> 00:42:56,162
He's not yours at all.

652
00:42:56,832 --> 00:43:00,631
Fine. I should go see
CEO Gong myself, then.

653
00:43:00,931 --> 00:43:03,672
I'll have his DNA
compared with mine.

654
00:43:04,241 --> 00:43:05,502
Angel Investment Corp.'s office...

655
00:43:05,502 --> 00:43:06,772
is at the APP building,
am I correct?

656
00:43:07,741 --> 00:43:09,611
No. You can't do that, Sang Gu.

657
00:43:10,712 --> 00:43:13,381
My Jin Dan doesn't know a thing.

658
00:43:13,912 --> 00:43:17,111
He thinks
he's the late chairman's son.

659
00:43:25,321 --> 00:43:26,422
Then...

660
00:43:28,292 --> 00:43:30,232
Jin Dan is really my son?

661
00:43:31,732 --> 00:43:32,931
Sang Gu...

662
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:40,901
I lived my life...

663
00:43:41,741 --> 00:43:44,312
not knowing I had a son.

664
00:43:44,942 --> 00:43:46,042
Hong Ae Kyo.

665
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:50,611
How could you keep me
in the dark for so long?

666
00:43:51,651 --> 00:43:54,922
No, I didn't. I didn't know either.

667
00:43:56,151 --> 00:43:58,591
Ever since I got pregnant with him,

668
00:43:59,022 --> 00:44:00,162
I really thought...

669
00:44:00,522 --> 00:44:03,462
the late Chairman Gong Dae Gil
was his father.

670
00:44:04,832 --> 00:44:06,531
But then you said...

671
00:44:06,861 --> 00:44:09,631
something weird about how
Jin Dan looked like your father.

672
00:44:10,372 --> 00:44:12,002
So I had a test done.

673
00:44:12,801 --> 00:44:14,471
He really was your son.

674
00:44:15,142 --> 00:44:18,281
I never imagined this,
even in my wildest dreams.

675
00:44:19,982 --> 00:44:22,812
By test, do you mean a DNA test?

676
00:44:22,812 --> 00:44:25,022
Did it really say he was my son?

677
00:44:27,022 --> 00:44:28,091
Yes.

678
00:44:28,491 --> 00:44:32,162
Ae Kyo. Will you let me see him?

679
00:44:32,292 --> 00:44:33,491
My son Jin Dan.

680
00:44:33,562 --> 00:44:34,931
What do you mean?

681
00:44:35,392 --> 00:44:36,832
You can't ever do that.

682
00:44:36,962 --> 00:44:38,562
I can't? Why not?

683
00:44:38,761 --> 00:44:40,031
Why can't I see my son?

684
00:44:40,031 --> 00:44:41,801
I told you last time.

685
00:44:42,701 --> 00:44:44,971
Chairman Gong Jin Taek...

686
00:44:45,471 --> 00:44:48,111
will adopt Jin Dan soon.

687
00:44:48,341 --> 00:44:51,181
It's an important step to make him
APP Group's successor.

688
00:44:51,942 --> 00:44:54,341
What if you were
to suddenly announce you're his dad?

689
00:44:54,752 --> 00:44:56,982
Not only
will the adoption fall through,

690
00:44:57,082 --> 00:44:58,582
but we'll both get kicked out.

691
00:44:58,982 --> 00:45:01,321
We'll lose everything overnight.

692
00:45:01,792 --> 00:45:03,792
Must you take us down with you?

693
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,562
Then what?

694
00:45:05,792 --> 00:45:07,192
What do you want me to do?

695
00:45:07,422 --> 00:45:09,192
There's nothing else you can do.

696
00:45:09,962 --> 00:45:11,562
Spend some time in the Philippines.

697
00:45:11,562 --> 00:45:13,261
That's not right, Ae Kyo.

698
00:45:13,462 --> 00:45:15,801
My son's alive and well
here in Seoul.

699
00:45:21,471 --> 00:45:24,982
Then you must live quietly
as if you're dead.

700
00:45:26,082 --> 00:45:29,051
Do that for Jin Dan
if not anything else.

701
00:45:29,511 --> 00:45:31,622
Do that
unless you want to ruin his life.

702
00:45:31,951 --> 00:45:34,721
Okay. I can promise you that.

703
00:45:34,792 --> 00:45:36,852
I won't say I'm Jin Dan's dad.

704
00:45:36,852 --> 00:45:38,122
I'll live quietly.

705
00:45:39,792 --> 00:45:43,031
I really need you to keep your word.

706
00:45:44,801 --> 00:45:45,832
I will.

707
00:45:47,301 --> 00:45:48,531
Thank you, Ae Kyo.

708
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:52,401
To think that I have a son...

709
00:46:09,991 --> 00:46:12,892
Now I can see he looks like me.

710
00:46:14,192 --> 00:46:15,892
He is my son.

711
00:46:16,892 --> 00:46:18,901
I have blood in this city.

712
00:46:23,332 --> 00:46:24,401
Jin Dan.

713
00:46:25,372 --> 00:46:28,042
You're not Gong Jin Dan.
You're Jin Jin Dan.

714
00:46:28,611 --> 00:46:29,741
That's your name.

715
00:46:38,321 --> 00:46:40,252
(Tae Hee)

716
00:46:43,491 --> 00:46:44,622
Hi, Tae Hee.

717
00:46:44,892 --> 00:46:47,662
My friend So Hee and her boyfriend
will join us tomorrow.

718
00:46:47,892 --> 00:46:49,192
Do you mind?

719
00:46:49,292 --> 00:46:50,962
I don't mind at all.

720
00:46:50,962 --> 00:46:53,261
I rented the whole restaurant.

721
00:46:53,431 --> 00:46:55,931
You can invite more friends
if you want.

722
00:46:57,232 --> 00:46:58,801
See you tomorrow, then.

723
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,602
All right. See you.

724
00:47:04,611 --> 00:47:05,841
Welcome.

725
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:09,511
Hello, Mr. Gong. What's all this?

726
00:47:09,582 --> 00:47:11,821
Why did you buy so much?

727
00:47:11,881 --> 00:47:14,551
- My goodness.
- It's nothing at all.

728
00:47:15,221 --> 00:47:17,651
For you, Ms. Baek,
and Ji Young's grandmother,

729
00:47:18,122 --> 00:47:21,761
I got a skincare set
and some clothes.

730
00:47:22,462 --> 00:47:25,502
- It's a small gift, really.
- Thanks, Mr. Gong.

731
00:47:25,502 --> 00:47:29,201
Wait. I'll make you
a delicious dumpling soup.

732
00:47:29,201 --> 00:47:32,142
Sit down and wait. Come on, sit.

733
00:47:32,672 --> 00:47:34,042
You can sit over here.

734
00:47:34,471 --> 00:47:35,571
Okay.

735
00:47:44,151 --> 00:47:46,451
The fruits are so nice and fleshy.

736
00:47:46,451 --> 00:47:48,752
I can tell they were expensive.

737
00:47:49,821 --> 00:47:54,562
I wiped the floor clean
with a rag earlier.

738
00:47:54,792 --> 00:47:55,991
Is it dirty?

739
00:47:56,792 --> 00:47:58,261
No.

740
00:47:58,531 --> 00:48:01,872
I'm not used to sitting on
a bare floor.

741
00:48:03,431 --> 00:48:07,201
Do rich people sit
only on couches and chairs?

742
00:48:25,522 --> 00:48:29,131
What's wrong?
Does it not taste good?

743
00:48:30,792 --> 00:48:32,361
No, it's delicious.

744
00:48:32,361 --> 00:48:35,332
It's just that I had a late lunch.

745
00:48:38,102 --> 00:48:40,071
It's fine, Mr. Gong.

746
00:48:40,071 --> 00:48:42,611
Just eat as much as you want.

747
00:48:43,542 --> 00:48:45,312
I make the best dumplings...

748
00:48:45,611 --> 00:48:48,681
and kimchi
in the whole neighborhood.

749
00:48:48,681 --> 00:48:53,582
If you have no appetite,
try some winter cabbage kimchi.

750
00:48:54,352 --> 00:48:57,651
It will make your mouth water.

751
00:48:58,292 --> 00:49:02,261
Here. Let me tear you a piece.

752
00:49:02,431 --> 00:49:05,361
There you go. Try it with the soup.

753
00:49:05,701 --> 00:49:07,431
It's so good.

754
00:49:10,672 --> 00:49:12,602
Oh, gosh. Ms. Lee.

755
00:49:12,701 --> 00:49:15,341
Why did you tear it by hand?
That's disgusting.

756
00:49:15,341 --> 00:49:17,312
You can't do that these days.

757
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:19,142
What? It's disgusting?

758
00:49:19,912 --> 00:49:22,511
I washed my hands
before we sat to eat.

759
00:49:22,511 --> 00:49:25,821
How dare you talk like that to me,
you evil witch?

760
00:49:25,881 --> 00:49:29,252
Look. My hands are
a hundred times cleaner than yours.

761
00:49:29,252 --> 00:49:30,792
Who are you calling disgusting?

762
00:49:30,792 --> 00:49:33,062
- She called me disgusting.
- Grandma.

763
00:49:33,062 --> 00:49:34,292
- Disgusting? My foot!
- Let it go.

764
00:49:34,292 --> 00:49:35,531
- It's fine.
- Darn you.

765
00:49:35,531 --> 00:49:37,732
Finish your dumpling soup!

766
00:49:37,732 --> 00:49:38,901
- Finish my food?
- Yes!

767
00:49:38,901 --> 00:49:40,602
- Goodness.
- Grandma.

768
00:49:40,732 --> 00:49:42,401
She has dementia.

769
00:49:42,701 --> 00:49:44,971
She thinks I'm Ji Young's stepmom.
That's what it is.

770
00:49:44,971 --> 00:49:46,872
Just go ahead and eat your food.

771
00:49:46,872 --> 00:49:47,872
Eat.

772
00:49:48,272 --> 00:49:49,672
My goodness.

773
00:49:49,672 --> 00:49:51,042
Why did you share it with your hand?

774
00:49:51,042 --> 00:49:53,381
Look at this mess! Gosh.

775
00:49:53,712 --> 00:49:55,582
I'm so sorry, Mr. Gong.

776
00:49:55,752 --> 00:49:58,681
You couldn't eat
because of my grandmother.

777
00:49:59,582 --> 00:50:02,122
It's all right. I had enough.

778
00:50:03,392 --> 00:50:06,491
By the way,
why did you invite me to your place?

779
00:50:08,462 --> 00:50:09,732
I wanted...

780
00:50:10,631 --> 00:50:12,631
to tell you that I was sorry.

781
00:50:14,662 --> 00:50:17,901
I'm sorry for everything.

782
00:50:19,801 --> 00:50:20,942
You're sorry?

783
00:50:20,942 --> 00:50:22,571
Why are you saying that
all of a sudden?

784
00:50:24,471 --> 00:50:25,881
Come on.

785
00:50:27,912 --> 00:50:30,912
What are you trying to say
after giving me some dumpling soup?

786
00:50:30,982 --> 00:50:32,151
It's not like that.

787
00:50:33,522 --> 00:50:36,721
I have been misunderstanding
your feelings for me.

788
00:50:37,852 --> 00:50:40,591
You've been nothing
but nice and caring toward me,

789
00:50:42,462 --> 00:50:45,162
but I didn't appreciate it.

790
00:50:48,031 --> 00:50:49,031
Ji Young.

791
00:50:55,111 --> 00:50:58,181
You deeply broke my heart,
so I was really upset.

792
00:50:59,511 --> 00:51:01,651
But you finally realized
my feelings for you.

793
00:51:03,111 --> 00:51:05,352
I promise
I'll be an even better boyfriend...

794
00:51:05,681 --> 00:51:06,821
from now on.

795
00:51:08,721 --> 00:51:09,752
Ji Young.

796
00:51:22,502 --> 00:51:23,502
Gosh.

797
00:51:30,741 --> 00:51:33,181
Actually, I had something
to take care of at work.

798
00:51:33,312 --> 00:51:35,852
I will get things done
and give you a call.

799
00:51:35,852 --> 00:51:37,712
Ji Young, let's talk on the phone.

800
00:51:37,712 --> 00:51:38,881
Bye.

801
00:51:59,841 --> 00:52:00,841
(Director Ko Pil Seung)

802
00:52:00,841 --> 00:52:03,011
(Ji Young,
I have something to tell you.)

803
00:52:03,111 --> 00:52:05,181
Ji Young,
I have something to tell you.

804
00:52:06,241 --> 00:52:07,642
Can I see you for a moment?

805
00:52:17,352 --> 00:52:18,361
I'm sorry.

806
00:52:20,591 --> 00:52:22,361
I won't make any excuses.

807
00:52:24,062 --> 00:52:26,062
Everything you remember is true.

808
00:52:30,471 --> 00:52:32,571
From that day
until this very moment,

809
00:52:34,772 --> 00:52:36,812
I've regretted
hundreds of times every day...

810
00:52:39,681 --> 00:52:42,011
that I refused
to hold your hand that day.

811
00:52:43,881 --> 00:52:45,422
I've lived with regrets.

812
00:52:49,692 --> 00:52:50,721
I'm sorry.

813
00:52:52,861 --> 00:52:54,261
I really am.

814
00:52:55,631 --> 00:52:56,962
I don't understand...

815
00:52:58,631 --> 00:53:00,602
what the point
of saying all this now is.

816
00:53:03,071 --> 00:53:05,602
If you were going to say that,

817
00:53:05,602 --> 00:53:09,412
why didn't you say it
when you knew I was Park Do Ra?

818
00:53:11,241 --> 00:53:13,312
If I hadn't regained my memories,

819
00:53:13,681 --> 00:53:16,051
you wouldn't have told me
any of this for good.

820
00:53:17,352 --> 00:53:19,051
Then I would've fallen for you...

821
00:53:20,051 --> 00:53:22,292
and grown feelings for you...

822
00:53:22,821 --> 00:53:24,352
without knowing anything.

823
00:53:27,422 --> 00:53:28,591
Like a fool.

824
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:35,031
Right.

825
00:53:38,272 --> 00:53:40,372
Even if you resent and hate me,

826
00:53:42,471 --> 00:53:43,812
I have nothing to say.

827
00:53:47,042 --> 00:53:48,781
I guess I'm being punished...

828
00:53:50,781 --> 00:53:52,181
for letting go of your hand
back then.

829
00:53:54,051 --> 00:53:55,151
I will take...

830
00:53:56,491 --> 00:53:57,591
my punishment.

831
00:54:03,062 --> 00:54:04,892
But I really want you...

832
00:54:06,462 --> 00:54:08,602
to grow into a better actress
through this project...

833
00:54:09,931 --> 00:54:11,531
and sincerely support you.

834
00:54:12,571 --> 00:54:16,442
So I don't want you to feel
uncomfortable working with me.

835
00:54:17,571 --> 00:54:20,781
I wanted to tell you this,
so I asked you to come.

836
00:54:22,281 --> 00:54:23,551
I understand.

837
00:54:25,451 --> 00:54:27,582
I'll try my best for the project.

838
00:54:29,122 --> 00:54:32,622
And I'll talk to you at work
if there's anything I need.

839
00:54:33,821 --> 00:54:35,462
I'll get going then.

840
00:54:54,611 --> 00:54:56,212
- Okay.
- All right.

841
00:54:56,681 --> 00:54:58,011
Hello.

842
00:54:59,122 --> 00:55:00,781
Go on ahead. All right.

843
00:55:02,991 --> 00:55:05,261
Yes, Mr. Lee. Popcorn Entertainment
can use this place...

844
00:55:05,261 --> 00:55:07,292
for a retreat or something
whenever they want.

845
00:55:07,292 --> 00:55:09,392
My gosh. Thank you so much.

846
00:55:09,462 --> 00:55:12,102
I'll sign up for a lesson then.

847
00:55:12,102 --> 00:55:13,401
- I can pay for the lesson.
- Thank you.

848
00:55:13,401 --> 00:55:15,701
How nice of you!

849
00:55:15,701 --> 00:55:17,272
If you are interested...

850
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:18,841
Of course. Any time.

851
00:55:22,442 --> 00:55:24,241
- Mom and Dad,
- Hey.

852
00:55:24,241 --> 00:55:25,381
what is all this?

853
00:55:26,181 --> 00:55:28,781
Your mom was up all night
preparing food...

854
00:55:28,781 --> 00:55:31,511
for this ritual ceremony
for your new project.

855
00:55:32,151 --> 00:55:33,181
My gosh.

856
00:55:33,482 --> 00:55:35,922
The company took care of everything.
You didn't have to do this.

857
00:55:35,922 --> 00:55:37,252
This is just what I wanted to do.

858
00:55:37,252 --> 00:55:39,321
It's not like
what the company prepared.

859
00:55:39,321 --> 00:55:40,361
She's right.

860
00:55:40,422 --> 00:55:42,792
I just want
my son's new project to go well.

861
00:55:43,662 --> 00:55:44,962
Take the food out.

862
00:55:45,761 --> 00:55:46,761
Thank you.

863
00:55:46,761 --> 00:55:49,471
If the project goes well,
I owe it all to you.

864
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:50,571
Come on.

865
00:55:50,571 --> 00:55:52,942
That's because you did a great job.

866
00:56:00,611 --> 00:56:03,582
But you know
the world can't know who she is.

867
00:56:04,212 --> 00:56:06,082
She decided to remain Kim Ji Young.

868
00:56:06,082 --> 00:56:08,122
We call her that now too.
We don't call her Do Ra.

869
00:56:10,392 --> 00:56:12,861
Is the tenant lady Park Do Ra?

870
00:56:13,692 --> 00:56:15,562
And she lost her memories?

871
00:56:17,232 --> 00:56:20,761
I can't believe she's still alive.
I mean, she's the famous Park Do Ra.

872
00:56:21,431 --> 00:56:22,672
What about Park Do Ra?

873
00:56:22,872 --> 00:56:24,602
Gosh. You startled me, Mom!

874
00:56:24,872 --> 00:56:28,241
By the way, why are you talking
about Park Do Ra when she's dead?

875
00:56:28,942 --> 00:56:30,372
When did I do that?

876
00:56:30,372 --> 00:56:32,812
You just said something
about Park Do Ra.

877
00:56:32,841 --> 00:56:33,912
Well...

878
00:56:35,281 --> 00:56:38,781
I thought an actress like Park Do Ra
would be perfect for the role,

879
00:56:38,781 --> 00:56:40,721
so I was muttering to myself.

880
00:56:41,551 --> 00:56:42,752
You think so?

881
00:56:43,821 --> 00:56:44,821
By the way,

882
00:56:45,792 --> 00:56:48,261
why is the gold digger
who made Mr. Kim die...

883
00:56:48,261 --> 00:56:51,131
and the tenant lady sitting together?

884
00:56:52,002 --> 00:56:53,162
Well...

885
00:56:53,562 --> 00:56:55,631
Apparently,
Ji Young belongs to her agency.

886
00:56:55,631 --> 00:56:56,872
I guess that's why.

887
00:56:58,131 --> 00:56:59,701
How did you know that?

888
00:56:59,901 --> 00:57:00,942
What?

889
00:57:02,011 --> 00:57:03,011
Well...

890
00:57:03,642 --> 00:57:06,212
A writer who is a friend of mine
is close to the staff member here.

891
00:57:06,212 --> 00:57:07,381
I heard that from her.

892
00:57:08,111 --> 00:57:09,111
What?

893
00:57:20,922 --> 00:57:24,292
(We wish the success
of "Seoul Lady.")

894
00:57:26,962 --> 00:57:28,261
Please let us...

895
00:57:29,031 --> 00:57:31,571
finish the shoot of "Seoul Lady"
with no problem.

896
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:35,471
And please let it be loved
by a lot of viewers.

897
00:57:43,551 --> 00:57:46,781
All right. I brought a big one.

898
00:57:47,181 --> 00:57:48,181
Applaud.

899
00:57:51,192 --> 00:57:53,022
All right. Here.

900
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:07,571
Sir, I thought we were going
to have a meeting here.

901
00:58:08,341 --> 00:58:09,611
Where are the buyers?

902
00:58:10,042 --> 00:58:12,281
Oh, didn't I tell you that?

903
00:58:12,611 --> 00:58:13,681
It's called off.

904
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:14,781
Pardon?

905
00:58:15,451 --> 00:58:17,352
Now that we're here,

906
00:58:18,622 --> 00:58:19,922
let's just have some drinks.

907
00:58:25,192 --> 00:58:26,292
I should get going.

908
00:58:26,761 --> 00:58:28,122
Where do you think you're going?

909
00:58:31,631 --> 00:58:32,732
Let go of me.

910
00:58:33,562 --> 00:58:36,002
Let go. Otherwise, I'll scream.

911
00:58:36,071 --> 00:58:37,931
Go ahead and scream!

912
00:58:39,002 --> 00:58:40,071
There's no one around here.

913
00:58:42,942 --> 00:58:44,542
You walked in freely,

914
00:58:44,542 --> 00:58:45,542
but leaving...

915
00:58:46,511 --> 00:58:47,982
requires clearance.

916
00:58:49,011 --> 00:58:50,951
No. I don't want to stay.

917
00:58:50,951 --> 00:58:52,752
Let go of me. I don't want this.

918
00:59:07,861 --> 00:59:09,131
Cut. Okay!

919
00:59:24,951 --> 00:59:26,721
Ji Young, are you all right?

920
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:29,522
Here. Have some water.

921
00:59:39,562 --> 00:59:40,631
Okay?

922
00:59:50,872 --> 00:59:51,912
Ji Young?

923
00:59:56,082 --> 00:59:57,381
What's wrong with her?

924
00:59:57,781 --> 00:59:59,221
- Ji Young.
- Ji Young.

925
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:02,151
Get out there.

926
01:00:03,392 --> 01:00:05,522
Ji Young!

927
01:00:06,292 --> 01:00:07,361
Ji Young.

928
01:00:08,761 --> 01:00:09,792
Ji Young!

929
01:00:10,292 --> 01:00:11,292
Ji Young!

930
01:00:31,082 --> 01:00:32,522
What do you think you're doing?

931
01:00:32,881 --> 01:00:34,321
I don't want to hurt you,

932
01:00:34,321 --> 01:00:36,622
so don't drive me insane. Got it?

933
01:00:40,192 --> 01:00:42,232
Open this door!

934
01:00:42,931 --> 01:00:44,131
Open this door.

935
01:00:44,131 --> 01:00:45,261
Help!

936
01:00:45,431 --> 01:00:47,102
Someone's locked in this room!

937
01:00:48,462 --> 01:00:50,531
Ji Young!

938
01:00:51,672 --> 01:00:52,801
Kim Ji Young!

939
01:00:53,942 --> 01:00:55,272
Park Do Ra!

940
01:00:55,872 --> 01:00:57,071
Park Do Ra, where did you go?

941
01:00:57,212 --> 01:00:59,312
You won't get away with this!

942
01:01:13,122 --> 01:01:14,192
Ji Young!

943
01:01:16,192 --> 01:01:17,261
Ji Young!

944
01:01:19,462 --> 01:01:21,531
- Ji Young!
- Ji Young.

945
01:01:21,531 --> 01:01:23,571
- Ji Young!
- Gosh, it's pouring.

946
01:01:23,732 --> 01:01:25,201
- Ji Young!
- Ji Young!

947
01:01:25,301 --> 01:01:27,401
Ji Young, please...

948
01:01:37,312 --> 01:01:40,082
- Park Do Ra!
- Park Do Ra!

949
01:01:40,181 --> 01:01:41,221
Do Ra!

950
01:01:50,292 --> 01:01:52,401
- Wait.
- Do Ra, wait.

951
01:01:52,401 --> 01:01:54,261
- Wait!
- Don't go!

952
01:02:03,212 --> 01:02:04,812
You're my star,

953
01:02:04,812 --> 01:02:06,412
and I'm your moon.

954
01:02:06,741 --> 01:02:07,881
I'm sorry.

955
01:02:10,781 --> 01:02:12,051
But I can't do this.

956
01:02:12,051 --> 01:02:14,281
Doing this for a few hours
will get me two million dollars.

957
01:02:14,821 --> 01:02:16,651
Can you get me that kind of money?

958
01:02:17,821 --> 01:02:19,692
This will be my decision to regret,

959
01:02:19,792 --> 01:02:22,022
so get lost if you don't have
two million dollars!

960
01:02:28,502 --> 01:02:29,571
I...

961
01:02:33,372 --> 01:02:35,412
remember everything now.

962
01:02:39,442 --> 01:02:40,482
Everything.

963
01:02:45,352 --> 01:02:46,482
Ji Young!

964
01:02:48,852 --> 01:02:49,892
Ji Young!

965
01:02:51,651 --> 01:02:52,721
Ji Young!

966
01:02:56,091 --> 01:02:57,131
Ji Young!

967
01:02:59,062 --> 01:03:00,131
Ji Young!

968
01:03:00,131 --> 01:03:01,261
Pil Seung...

969
01:03:03,002 --> 01:03:04,002
Ji Young!

970
01:03:06,872 --> 01:03:07,971
Ji Young!

971
01:03:13,912 --> 01:03:15,042
Ji Young!

972
01:03:20,422 --> 01:03:21,451
Ji Young!

973
01:03:24,292 --> 01:03:25,422
Ji Young!

974
01:03:27,761 --> 01:03:28,792
Ji Young!

975
01:03:32,901 --> 01:03:33,962
Ji Young!

976
01:03:35,801 --> 01:03:36,832
Ji Young!

977
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:39,872
Ji Young!

978
01:03:41,942 --> 01:03:43,042
Ji Young!

979
01:03:48,681 --> 01:03:50,412
It wasn't you but me.

980
01:03:53,252 --> 01:03:55,321
I was the one who betrayed you.

981
01:03:57,651 --> 01:03:59,392
All I did was inflict pain.

982
01:04:00,591 --> 01:04:02,232
All I did was hurt you.

983
01:04:07,301 --> 01:04:11,301
So why are you still choosing to be
by my side like a fool?

984
01:04:17,372 --> 01:04:20,681
You should've erased a witch
like me from your memories.

985
01:04:23,881 --> 01:04:25,312
You should've erased me.

986
01:04:30,252 --> 01:04:31,821
I'm sorry, Pil Seung...

987
01:04:34,922 --> 01:04:36,531
I'm sorry, Pil Seung.

988
01:04:40,931 --> 01:04:43,701
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

989
01:05:15,971 --> 01:05:18,571
Why are you suddenly packing?
Where are you going?

990
01:05:18,571 --> 01:05:20,672
And what do you mean
you found a place to live?

991
01:05:20,672 --> 01:05:23,442
I want to live as Kim Ji Young
and not as your daughter Park Do Ra.

992
01:05:23,542 --> 01:05:25,681
Let our love be forever.

993
01:05:25,781 --> 01:05:27,281
They say that people never change.

994
01:05:27,381 --> 01:05:29,352
Then and even now,

995
01:05:29,352 --> 01:05:32,551
he's still trying to win me over
by flashing his money.

996
01:05:32,651 --> 01:05:33,651
How are you going to correct this?

997
01:05:33,651 --> 01:05:35,221
How will you make up
for this huge loss?

998
01:05:35,321 --> 01:05:36,551
Don't worry.

999
01:05:36,651 --> 01:05:38,892
They'll soon come running back to me.

1000
01:05:39,022 --> 01:05:41,221
What happened to you that day?

1001
01:05:41,221 --> 01:05:42,962
You remembered something else,
didn't you?

1002
01:05:43,091 --> 01:05:44,531
If so, please tell me
what you remember.

1003
01:05:45,799 --> 01:05:47,839
