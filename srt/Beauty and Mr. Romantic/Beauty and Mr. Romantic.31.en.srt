00:00:00,104 --> 00:00:07,363
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:10,692
(Episode 31)

3
00:00:10,692 --> 00:00:11,792
Mom.

4
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,732
Is Ms. Jang my birth mother?

5
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:21,842
No.

6
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:23,671
I'm not.

7
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:26,772
No, she's not. You heard wrong.

8
00:00:28,741 --> 00:00:29,841
Mom.

9
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:32,481
You just said so.

10
00:00:33,581 --> 00:00:36,022
You said she gave birth to me
and abandoned me on your doorstep.

11
00:00:39,521 --> 00:00:42,562
Pil Seung, it's not true.

12
00:00:42,562 --> 00:00:44,422
I...

13
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:46,192
- Pil Seung...
- You!

14
00:00:46,392 --> 00:00:48,162
How dare you?

15
00:00:48,831 --> 00:00:50,301
Who do you think you are?

16
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:52,802
Who are you
to call his name like that?

17
00:00:53,032 --> 00:00:55,971
What now?

18
00:00:58,111 --> 00:01:00,111
What are you going to do about this?

19
00:01:00,111 --> 00:01:03,711
- What now?
- Mom, what's wrong with you?

20
00:01:04,181 --> 00:01:05,382
Pil Seung,

21
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:08,151
that witch abandoned you
on our doorstep.

22
00:01:08,422 --> 00:01:11,122
You weren't even a week old,

23
00:01:11,422 --> 00:01:13,892
but she abandoned you
on our doorstep!

24
00:01:20,032 --> 00:01:21,162
No way.

25
00:01:22,461 --> 00:01:23,861
What?

26
00:01:23,861 --> 00:01:27,447
This witch abandoned a baby?

27
00:01:27,471 --> 00:01:31,272
A baby who was only a week old?

28
00:01:31,372 --> 00:01:34,917
You... You evil witch.

29
00:01:34,941 --> 00:01:36,541
You cow.

30
00:01:36,741 --> 00:01:40,082
How could you abandon
your own child?

31
00:01:41,452 --> 00:01:45,892
<i>Until the day the East Sea runs dry</i>

32
00:01:45,892 --> 00:01:47,752
<i>- And Mount Baekdu is worn away</i>
- Ma'am.

33
00:01:47,752 --> 00:01:49,491
You witch!

34
00:01:49,491 --> 00:01:52,431
- Ma'am, please.
- You witch.

35
00:01:59,402 --> 00:02:02,972
Director, where's my Ji Young?

36
00:02:03,441 --> 00:02:04,811
Director...

37
00:02:06,771 --> 00:02:09,542
Ms. Lee, hold on.
I'll take you to her.

38
00:02:09,542 --> 00:02:11,651
- Can you wait a second?
- Sure.

39
00:02:11,782 --> 00:02:14,252
My Ji Young...

40
00:02:33,671 --> 00:02:35,442
Yes, Director Ko.

41
00:02:36,302 --> 00:02:37,701
Ji Young, where are you?

42
00:02:38,212 --> 00:02:39,712
I'm home.

43
00:02:40,242 --> 00:02:41,442
What is this about?

44
00:02:42,342 --> 00:02:44,111
Your grandmother came by.

45
00:02:44,652 --> 00:02:46,551
What?

46
00:02:46,812 --> 00:02:49,122
My grandma showed up at your place?

47
00:02:49,282 --> 00:02:50,382
Yes,

48
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,721
but I think she's having
one of her episodes.

49
00:02:53,721 --> 00:02:55,921
She's singing
and constantly asking for you.

50
00:02:56,062 --> 00:02:57,667
Goodness.

51
00:02:57,691 --> 00:02:59,731
I'm sorry to ask,

52
00:02:59,731 --> 00:03:02,332
but can you keep her with you?

53
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:03,731
I'll come to you right away.

54
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:06,032
Actually, it'll be faster
for me to go to you.

55
00:03:06,332 --> 00:03:07,902
She keeps on asking for you.

56
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:09,402
I'll head there right away.

57
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:12,472
Sure. Oh, no.

58
00:03:12,612 --> 00:03:15,712
Grandma, my gosh.

59
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,352
Here.

60
00:03:29,161 --> 00:03:32,261
- Ji Young!
- Grandma.

61
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:35,002
- Ji Young!
- Gosh.

62
00:03:35,802 --> 00:03:38,701
Let me look at you.
Are you back to your old self?

63
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:39,932
Gosh.

64
00:03:40,201 --> 00:03:41,802
I heard that...

65
00:03:41,802 --> 00:03:43,971
you sang the national anthem
at his place.

66
00:03:43,971 --> 00:03:47,812
I know. It seems as though
I had one of my episodes again.

67
00:03:48,342 --> 00:03:50,612
You shouldn't have come here
without telling me.

68
00:03:50,612 --> 00:03:52,851
What if you had gotten lost?

69
00:03:52,851 --> 00:03:54,612
What if you had
one of your episodes...

70
00:03:54,612 --> 00:03:55,821
at a place that wasn't his?

71
00:03:55,821 --> 00:03:59,451
Hey. I lose my mind
only when it's safe to do so.

72
00:03:59,451 --> 00:04:01,721
I always stay lucid
at unfamiliar places.

73
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:04,221
What? Do you even hear yourself?

74
00:04:04,221 --> 00:04:06,432
This could've been bad!

75
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:09,662
Anyway, when did you move out?

76
00:04:09,802 --> 00:04:12,402
Why didn't you tell me?

77
00:04:13,101 --> 00:04:15,342
What? Well...

78
00:04:16,842 --> 00:04:19,812
Well, that's...

79
00:04:21,582 --> 00:04:22,782
Grandma,

80
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:26,451
let me explain that in detail
once we're inside.

81
00:04:26,451 --> 00:04:28,722
- Let's go.
- Sure.

82
00:04:28,821 --> 00:04:29,952
Director Ko,

83
00:04:30,951 --> 00:04:33,491
I'm sorry for putting you out.

84
00:04:34,122 --> 00:04:35,462
I appreciate this.

85
00:04:35,891 --> 00:04:37,061
It's all right.

86
00:04:37,162 --> 00:04:38,931
Wait. Hold on a second.

87
00:04:42,901 --> 00:04:45,371
I can't believe you.

88
00:04:46,102 --> 00:04:47,801
What was that?

89
00:04:49,571 --> 00:04:50,972
- These.
- Ji Young.

90
00:04:50,972 --> 00:04:53,012
Your grandma brought these.

91
00:04:53,812 --> 00:04:55,041
I'll get going, then.

92
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:57,611
Thank you, Director Ko.

93
00:04:58,581 --> 00:05:01,722
I truly appreciate
you driving my grandma here.

94
00:05:05,622 --> 00:05:07,622
Ms. Lee, I'll get going.

95
00:05:07,622 --> 00:05:11,262
Sure. I'll see you around.

96
00:05:11,321 --> 00:05:12,431
Right.

97
00:05:15,201 --> 00:05:16,501
- Head inside, then.
- Sure.

98
00:05:29,781 --> 00:05:33,381
What? Your grandma
from the countryside?

99
00:05:33,482 --> 00:05:36,722
Yes, she came to the city to see me.

100
00:05:36,951 --> 00:05:38,422
That's right.

101
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:40,622
You see, I've been seeing her...

102
00:05:40,622 --> 00:05:42,562
in my dreams lately.

103
00:05:42,562 --> 00:05:43,961
I missed her so much
and was curious about her...

104
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:45,861
which is why I came to see her.

105
00:05:46,831 --> 00:05:50,031
Gosh. Is she the lady
who saved Do Ra's life...

106
00:05:50,031 --> 00:05:52,001
and helped her get surgery?

107
00:05:53,372 --> 00:05:54,602
Grandma, have a seat.

108
00:05:54,602 --> 00:05:56,042
What? Sure.

109
00:05:56,042 --> 00:05:58,271
I'll get you something to drink.

110
00:05:58,271 --> 00:05:59,972
- Sure thing.
- Right.

111
00:06:02,182 --> 00:06:03,282
By the way,

112
00:06:03,581 --> 00:06:05,981
are you really...

113
00:06:06,511 --> 00:06:09,121
Ji Young's agent?

114
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:12,852
That's right. I'm the CEO
of the agency she's signed with.

115
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,792
She's been living with me here...

116
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,462
and has been receiving her training.

117
00:06:18,492 --> 00:06:21,861
Right, training or whatever.

118
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,631
But...

119
00:06:24,631 --> 00:06:26,532
I saw on TV...

120
00:06:26,901 --> 00:06:29,302
that CEO's usually live...

121
00:06:29,302 --> 00:06:31,712
in big, fancy apartments.

122
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:36,082
Well, I used to be one
who had quite the fortune as well.

123
00:06:36,211 --> 00:06:37,311
I see.

124
00:06:37,812 --> 00:06:39,711
- Grandma, here you go.
- Yes?

125
00:06:39,711 --> 00:06:41,452
Sure thing.

126
00:06:42,951 --> 00:06:44,222
Ji Young,

127
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:46,352
can't you...

128
00:06:46,352 --> 00:06:49,722
move back to Director Ko's place?

129
00:06:49,961 --> 00:06:53,031
Is there a need
to live here with your CEO...

130
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:55,332
when the unit at his place...

131
00:06:55,562 --> 00:06:58,231
is nice and spacious?

132
00:06:58,831 --> 00:07:02,672
It'll be uncomfortable
for her as well.

133
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,801
The situation doesn't seem ideal.

134
00:07:05,771 --> 00:07:07,641
It's not like that, Grandma.

135
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:09,941
Ms. Baek has been helping me...

136
00:07:09,941 --> 00:07:12,581
with my acting and such,

137
00:07:12,581 --> 00:07:13,812
so I must stay here.

138
00:07:13,812 --> 00:07:18,182
<i>Until the day the East Sea runs dry</i>

139
00:07:18,182 --> 00:07:22,191
<i>- And Mount Baekdu is worn away</i>
- What's wrong with her?

140
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,162
<i>May the deities</i>

141
00:07:24,162 --> 00:07:25,531
<i>- Protect our nation</i>
- She gets like this...

142
00:07:25,531 --> 00:07:26,891
when her dementia kicks in.

143
00:07:26,891 --> 00:07:29,461
Hurray to Korea

144
00:07:29,461 --> 00:07:30,662
I'm home.

145
00:07:30,662 --> 00:07:33,001
- What?
- Oh, Do Sik. Hey.

146
00:07:33,071 --> 00:07:35,342
Oh, my goodness.

147
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,271
Our dear Geum Dong is here.

148
00:07:37,271 --> 00:07:38,871
Goodness, Geum Dong.

149
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:45,652
Geum Dong, you're tired from
working all day today, aren't you?

150
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:49,581
Hey! What are you doing?

151
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:52,421
Your husband is here.
Why aren't you setting the table?

152
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:55,421
Geum Dong. Wait just a little while.

153
00:07:55,461 --> 00:07:57,991
I will go get you some cool water.

154
00:08:04,131 --> 00:08:07,272
So, are you saying that old lady
has dementia?

155
00:08:07,701 --> 00:08:10,502
Yes, she was doing better
for a while,

156
00:08:10,502 --> 00:08:12,311
but I think her symptoms
have gotten worse.

157
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:14,311
What should we do about my grandma?

158
00:08:15,011 --> 00:08:16,842
Then, who is Geum Dong?

159
00:08:17,281 --> 00:08:19,712
He's my dad who passed away.

160
00:08:19,881 --> 00:08:22,297
So, she thinks
I'm her son right now?

161
00:08:22,321 --> 00:08:24,021
Yes, I think so.

162
00:08:24,021 --> 00:08:26,791
And it seems like she thinks
Ms. Baek is my stepmother.

163
00:08:27,521 --> 00:08:28,621
Stepmother.

164
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:32,831
Hey, this won't do. You should send
your grandma to a nursing home.

165
00:08:32,831 --> 00:08:35,162
You could never handle this at home.

166
00:08:36,201 --> 00:08:38,102
No, I can't do that.

167
00:08:38,302 --> 00:08:40,631
How could I send my grandma
to a nursing home?

168
00:08:41,641 --> 00:08:44,371
I'm only alive now
thanks to my grandma.

169
00:08:45,011 --> 00:08:47,212
Hey, then what will you do?
You have a drama to shoot,

170
00:08:47,212 --> 00:08:49,182
and you have to live with us.

171
00:08:49,582 --> 00:08:54,111
Then, I'll find a room
and move out with my grandma.

172
00:08:54,252 --> 00:08:55,452
You can't do that!

173
00:08:57,082 --> 00:09:00,322
Hey, think of how we met.
How can we live apart?

174
00:09:00,322 --> 00:09:03,021
And you're my daughter.
We should live together.

175
00:09:03,021 --> 00:09:05,462
Right, Do Ra. I mean, Ji Young.

176
00:09:05,561 --> 00:09:08,092
Why should we be parted again?
That makes no sense.

177
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:09,761
Goodness.

178
00:09:10,102 --> 00:09:11,602
- Mom.
- What?

179
00:09:11,702 --> 00:09:14,602
Let's all live here together
with that grandma.

180
00:09:16,271 --> 00:09:17,418
What?

181
00:09:17,442 --> 00:09:20,472
That grandma saved our Ji Young,
and we should be grateful.

182
00:09:20,472 --> 00:09:22,682
Let's consider this
as repaying her kindness.

183
00:09:23,281 --> 00:09:24,682
Why, you! Seriously?

184
00:09:24,911 --> 00:09:27,281
"Seriously," what? This is my house.

185
00:09:30,952 --> 00:09:32,121
He's right.

186
00:09:34,151 --> 00:09:37,322
Pil Seung, that witch abandoned you
on our doorstep.

187
00:09:37,592 --> 00:09:40,261
You weren't even a week old,

188
00:09:40,631 --> 00:09:43,001
but she abandoned you
on our doorstep!

189
00:10:24,972 --> 00:10:26,942
I can't hold myself back anymore.

190
00:10:27,472 --> 00:10:29,582
It's true you did something wrong,

191
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,011
but still,

192
00:10:32,011 --> 00:10:34,411
I can't just watch
as they do this to you.

193
00:10:35,781 --> 00:10:37,981
I'm really okay, Ma Ri.

194
00:10:40,092 --> 00:10:41,192
But...

195
00:10:42,362 --> 00:10:44,422
Pil Seung found out.

196
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,292
Pil Seung...

197
00:10:47,862 --> 00:10:49,231
What do I do now?

198
00:10:50,161 --> 00:10:52,131
- What can I do?
- What?

199
00:10:53,801 --> 00:10:57,442
Pil Seung found out?

200
00:10:58,401 --> 00:10:59,611
Yes.

201
00:11:10,151 --> 00:11:11,722
(Pil Seung)

202
00:11:17,862 --> 00:11:21,192
Yes, Pil Seung. It's me.

203
00:11:40,212 --> 00:11:41,312
You're here.

204
00:11:49,222 --> 00:11:50,761
What I heard earlier...

205
00:11:52,261 --> 00:11:53,462
Is it all true?

206
00:11:55,031 --> 00:11:56,631
I came because
I wanted to check for myself.

207
00:11:58,031 --> 00:12:00,131
You're my biological mother
who gave birth to me and abandoned me.

208
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:04,641
Are you?

209
00:12:09,982 --> 00:12:12,251
Seeing how you can't bring yourself
to actually say it,

210
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:16,222
it must actually be true.

211
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:24,491
I'm sorry.

212
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:28,802
I'm sorry, Pil Seung.

213
00:12:32,602 --> 00:12:33,802
You're sorry?

214
00:12:36,702 --> 00:12:39,111
Is this something you can write off
by simply saying you're sorry?

215
00:12:44,511 --> 00:12:47,852
I really couldn't help it back then.

216
00:12:49,781 --> 00:12:52,251
I had a reason that I couldn't help.

217
00:12:55,661 --> 00:12:57,121
What reason could you have...

218
00:12:58,631 --> 00:13:01,391
to abandon a newborn baby
who was just a week old?

219
00:13:03,131 --> 00:13:04,661
What reason could you have...

220
00:13:05,801 --> 00:13:07,131
to abandon your own child?

221
00:13:08,031 --> 00:13:09,401
And at your friend's place at that?

222
00:13:09,671 --> 00:13:11,942
I wanted to see you like that,
at least.

223
00:13:13,072 --> 00:13:16,242
I wanted to check that you were
growing up safely...

224
00:13:16,242 --> 00:13:18,011
at least from a distance.
That was why...

225
00:13:18,011 --> 00:13:19,212
You...

226
00:13:20,681 --> 00:13:22,881
How could you be so selfish
until the very end?

227
00:13:24,352 --> 00:13:26,052
Do you call that
an excuse right now?

228
00:13:26,952 --> 00:13:28,991
- Pil Seung...
- So,

229
00:13:29,722 --> 00:13:31,692
you abandoned me in the care
of my mom, your friend,

230
00:13:31,722 --> 00:13:33,991
so you could see me
as you passed by when you wanted to?

231
00:13:35,092 --> 00:13:37,102
You know nothing other than
your own emotions?

232
00:13:37,531 --> 00:13:38,661
Don't you think about...

233
00:13:39,332 --> 00:13:42,302
my mom's emotions,
someone who considered you her friend?

234
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:44,172
Do only your emotions matter?

235
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:47,241
Did you never once think about...

236
00:13:47,771 --> 00:13:50,212
the hurt and betrayal
my mom would feel?

237
00:13:51,442 --> 00:13:54,781
How could you only think about
your own feelings until the end? How?

238
00:13:56,322 --> 00:13:59,792
I'm sorry, Pil Seung.

239
00:14:00,391 --> 00:14:02,092
I've committed a grave sin.

240
00:14:19,842 --> 00:14:21,371
I'm sorry, Pil Seung.

241
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:24,911
Gosh.

242
00:14:26,352 --> 00:14:29,852
But why isn't Pil Seung home yet?

243
00:14:30,421 --> 00:14:33,121
Do you think he might be
knocking back drinks somewhere?

244
00:14:33,952 --> 00:14:38,422
How could he not come home
just because he's upset?

245
00:14:38,862 --> 00:14:42,062
Mom, is Pil Seung a child?
He's old enough.

246
00:14:42,102 --> 00:14:43,302
I'm sure he'll come home.

247
00:14:44,362 --> 00:14:47,972
By the way, why did that
tenant lady's grandma...

248
00:14:48,072 --> 00:14:51,501
have to appear right then
and make such a ruckus?

249
00:14:51,901 --> 00:14:53,312
I know.

250
00:14:53,372 --> 00:14:55,442
Pil Seung must be confused enough
as it is.

251
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:59,111
While he was in a state of shock,
he even took care of that old lady.

252
00:15:00,011 --> 00:15:01,381
Gosh, I am quite worried.

253
00:15:03,921 --> 00:15:06,021
Hey, Pil Seung!

254
00:15:07,122 --> 00:15:08,692
Goodness, Pil Seung.

255
00:15:09,561 --> 00:15:11,962
Where have you been until now?

256
00:15:12,031 --> 00:15:16,001
We were so worried
after you left like that.

257
00:15:17,362 --> 00:15:19,602
I'm sorry. I had something to do.

258
00:15:19,832 --> 00:15:21,031
What about Mom?

259
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:22,842
Your mom...

260
00:15:23,742 --> 00:15:26,611
is in a state of shock
and is having a lie-down.

261
00:15:35,622 --> 00:15:36,922
Oh, Pil Seung.

262
00:15:37,322 --> 00:15:39,891
Honey. Pil Seung is here.

263
00:15:45,561 --> 00:15:46,792
Hey, Pil Seung.

264
00:15:47,761 --> 00:15:49,432
Are you okay?

265
00:15:50,031 --> 00:15:52,102
Of course, I'm fine.

266
00:15:52,572 --> 00:15:53,702
Gosh.

267
00:15:54,931 --> 00:15:56,042
Pil Seung.

268
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,312
You were very surprised earlier,
weren't you?

269
00:16:01,612 --> 00:16:02,712
I'm sorry.

270
00:16:04,411 --> 00:16:07,212
I didn't want you
to see any of that.

271
00:16:08,252 --> 00:16:10,052
But you ended up seeing it.

272
00:16:12,352 --> 00:16:13,692
I'm so sorry.

273
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,562
Why are you sorry?
What are you even saying?

274
00:16:19,531 --> 00:16:20,962
I'm worried about you.

275
00:16:22,602 --> 00:16:23,861
No.

276
00:16:24,931 --> 00:16:26,572
I'm just sorry about everything.

277
00:16:27,901 --> 00:16:29,472
I was such a fool.

278
00:16:31,271 --> 00:16:32,972
Because I'm a foolish mother,

279
00:16:33,572 --> 00:16:35,611
you had to see all of that.

280
00:16:36,982 --> 00:16:39,281
Mom, Dad.

281
00:16:40,112 --> 00:16:41,511
I'm really okay.

282
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,182
In this whole world,

283
00:16:46,421 --> 00:16:49,592
you're the only mom I have.

284
00:16:50,521 --> 00:16:51,692
I only have you, Mom.

285
00:16:54,561 --> 00:16:55,731
My dear Pil Seung.

286
00:16:57,301 --> 00:16:58,501
My son.

287
00:16:59,801 --> 00:17:01,472
Thank you for saying that.

288
00:17:03,742 --> 00:17:06,411
But I'm so upset
that I can't stand it.

289
00:17:07,472 --> 00:17:09,241
It's not anyone I don't know.

290
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,911
How could that wench, Soo Yeon...

291
00:17:15,311 --> 00:17:16,982
Honey, even still,

292
00:17:17,882 --> 00:17:20,451
you can't say that
in front of Pil Seung.

293
00:17:20,851 --> 00:17:22,621
He'll be upset.

294
00:17:26,031 --> 00:17:27,631
I'm sorry, Pil Seung.

295
00:17:30,761 --> 00:17:32,161
For me,

296
00:17:33,331 --> 00:17:36,342
you're the only one in the world.

297
00:17:37,271 --> 00:17:40,512
So I've always wondered
who your birth mother was,

298
00:17:41,142 --> 00:17:43,211
and I was really grateful.

299
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:47,012
So if she came to see you someday,

300
00:17:48,351 --> 00:17:50,921
I was going to express my gratitude.

301
00:17:53,351 --> 00:17:54,552
But...

302
00:17:55,922 --> 00:17:57,992
But I didn't see this coming.

303
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:01,631
I know I shouldn't be doing this.

304
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:05,161
I really thought she was my friend.

305
00:18:06,101 --> 00:18:09,101
But now that I know she approached me
when you were little...

306
00:18:09,101 --> 00:18:12,671
and deceived me
with all these lies on purpose,

307
00:18:13,742 --> 00:18:14,842
I just...

308
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:19,352
I can't bring myself to forgive her.

309
00:18:20,611 --> 00:18:21,711
If...

310
00:18:22,281 --> 00:18:24,982
If it were up to me,

311
00:18:25,382 --> 00:18:26,492
I...

312
00:18:27,252 --> 00:18:28,792
Seriously, I would...

313
00:18:32,462 --> 00:18:34,232
I'm sorry, Pil Seung.

314
00:18:36,761 --> 00:18:37,861
Mom.

315
00:18:39,132 --> 00:18:41,802
I also can't forgive her
for breaking your heart like this.

316
00:18:42,442 --> 00:18:45,542
So, Mom, you should do
whatever you want to do.

317
00:18:47,571 --> 00:18:48,671
Pil Seung.

318
00:18:56,581 --> 00:18:57,782
My son.

319
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,092
- Pil Seung.
- Mom.

320
00:19:05,361 --> 00:19:06,891
My dear Pil Seung.

321
00:19:07,892 --> 00:19:09,062
My son.

322
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,871
I'm sorry I upset you the other day.

323
00:19:19,271 --> 00:19:21,971
And I'm sorry
for saying such harsh words.

324
00:19:23,712 --> 00:19:25,812
Just promise me
it won't happen again.

325
00:19:34,492 --> 00:19:36,361
Let's eat this and make up.

326
00:19:42,091 --> 00:19:44,102
It's crispy and delicious.

327
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:45,901
You should try one too.

328
00:19:47,601 --> 00:19:48,732
Thanks.

329
00:19:53,742 --> 00:19:55,641
It's well fried.

330
00:19:57,912 --> 00:19:59,252
Now I feel much better.

331
00:19:59,882 --> 00:20:02,721
Me too. I'm feeling a lot better.

332
00:20:03,781 --> 00:20:05,621
Why? Did something bad happen?

333
00:20:06,152 --> 00:20:07,992
Things were crazy at home.

334
00:20:09,422 --> 00:20:10,692
You know...

335
00:20:10,692 --> 00:20:12,562
the secret behind Pil Seung's birth.

336
00:20:13,632 --> 00:20:14,632
I do.

337
00:20:14,632 --> 00:20:17,401
When I was this little and my family
was renting your extra room,

338
00:20:17,561 --> 00:20:19,531
Pil Seung found out
he was a foundling...

339
00:20:19,531 --> 00:20:21,031
and ran away from home.

340
00:20:21,031 --> 00:20:23,702
That's how my family found it out.

341
00:20:23,702 --> 00:20:27,772
And we just found out
who Pil Seung's birth mother was.

342
00:20:28,212 --> 00:20:29,411
Seriously?

343
00:20:29,982 --> 00:20:31,912
But how? So, who is she?

344
00:20:31,912 --> 00:20:33,752
What made her abandon her own child?

345
00:20:33,952 --> 00:20:35,151
The thing is...

346
00:20:35,851 --> 00:20:38,681
She is my sister-in-law,
Sun Young's...

347
00:20:39,051 --> 00:20:40,221
I mean,

348
00:20:41,351 --> 00:20:44,621
It was
Pil Seung's mom's best friend.

349
00:20:44,922 --> 00:20:46,591
My goodness. Really?

350
00:20:46,591 --> 00:20:48,492
Yes. Unbelievable, right?

351
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,191
It was really nice.

352
00:21:02,649 --> 00:21:04,459
I know Ji Young belongs
to Baek Entertainment,

353
00:21:05,459 --> 00:21:07,759
but how can she be living
in such a lousy house with her?

354
00:21:09,859 --> 00:21:13,428
Did she have no place to go
after she got kicked out...

355
00:21:14,629 --> 00:21:16,368
of Ko Pil Seung's house?

356
00:21:19,298 --> 00:21:20,408
Wait.

357
00:21:21,068 --> 00:21:23,678
Why do I even care
about that country bumpkin?

358
00:21:36,048 --> 00:21:37,219
What?

359
00:21:37,459 --> 00:21:40,259
Director Ko has a birth mother?

360
00:21:40,588 --> 00:21:43,428
Oh, right. You don't remember that.

361
00:21:44,028 --> 00:21:45,758
It's just that you lost your memory.

362
00:21:45,758 --> 00:21:47,469
When we were little,
we were renting their extra room.

363
00:21:47,469 --> 00:21:49,229
One day, Pil Seung found out
he was a foundling,

364
00:21:49,229 --> 00:21:51,098
and things got really crazy.

365
00:21:52,268 --> 00:21:53,398
Really?

366
00:21:53,469 --> 00:21:56,778
And it turns out his birth mother...

367
00:21:56,778 --> 00:21:59,438
and his foster mom were
best friends.

368
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:01,549
So she visited his house a lot.

369
00:22:01,649 --> 00:22:03,919
Pil Seung's mom yelled
at his birth mother and everything.

370
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,319
Apparently, things were crazy there.

371
00:22:06,578 --> 00:22:09,689
And when your grandmother
showed up there,

372
00:22:09,689 --> 00:22:11,489
things got even worse.

373
00:22:13,288 --> 00:22:14,388
I see.

374
00:22:15,088 --> 00:22:17,158
Hang on. Hey, Do Sik.

375
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:19,198
How do you know all that?

376
00:22:19,498 --> 00:22:22,769
Are you still dating that darn brat?

377
00:22:23,129 --> 00:22:24,269
No!

378
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:26,969
I just ran into her by chance.

379
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:28,338
You're lying!

380
00:22:28,538 --> 00:22:29,639
You've been seeing her
without telling me.

381
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:32,278
I know you've been texting someone
every night.

382
00:22:32,278 --> 00:22:33,479
Did you think I wouldn't notice?

383
00:22:33,479 --> 00:22:36,409
This is no time for you
to be dating a girl...

384
00:22:36,409 --> 00:22:38,579
from the family
who is our sworn enemy.

385
00:22:39,848 --> 00:22:40,948
Geum Dong,

386
00:22:41,518 --> 00:22:42,789
are you having an affair?

387
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:44,019
What?

388
00:22:44,619 --> 00:22:46,359
After Ji Young's mom died,

389
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:49,759
you brought
this old brat home yourself.

390
00:22:50,058 --> 00:22:52,898
And now you're having an affair?

391
00:22:53,129 --> 00:22:55,298
If you want
to be with her that much,

392
00:22:55,298 --> 00:22:57,769
you have to get a divorce first.

393
00:22:58,038 --> 00:23:00,368
You have to kick this wicked witch
out of the house.

394
00:23:04,379 --> 00:23:05,479
Oh, dear.

395
00:23:13,488 --> 00:23:14,888
Listen.

396
00:23:15,318 --> 00:23:17,518
I get that
the old lady has dementia,

397
00:23:17,518 --> 00:23:19,159
but it's just ridiculous...

398
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:21,629
that she thinks Do Sik is her son
and I'm your stepmother.

399
00:23:21,629 --> 00:23:25,459
It's strange that she thinks
Do Sik and I are married.

400
00:23:25,659 --> 00:23:29,269
I can't live with her like this.
It's so cramped in here already.

401
00:23:30,598 --> 00:23:34,039
Then I'll give up on my career
and go back with her.

402
00:23:34,738 --> 00:23:37,679
I can give up
on becoming an actress,

403
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,639
but I can never abandon
my grandmother.

404
00:23:39,639 --> 00:23:40,649
What?

405
00:23:40,649 --> 00:23:43,578
Mom, you should try
to put up with her.

406
00:23:43,578 --> 00:23:45,448
What's so wrong
about being called a stepmother?

407
00:23:45,649 --> 00:23:48,848
I mean,
the lady saved Ji Young's life.

408
00:23:49,318 --> 00:23:51,188
You darn brat, you keep saying...

409
00:23:51,719 --> 00:23:53,659
I'll take good care
of Grandmother...

410
00:23:53,659 --> 00:23:55,489
so she won't give you a hard time.

411
00:23:55,528 --> 00:23:58,529
So please let me live
with Grandmother.

412
00:23:59,498 --> 00:24:01,928
I just can't let her
live somewhere else.

413
00:24:38,238 --> 00:24:40,098
I didn't want to see you ever again,

414
00:24:41,568 --> 00:24:43,509
but I thought
we would have to talk about work.

415
00:24:46,538 --> 00:24:48,678
Fine. I get it.

416
00:24:50,209 --> 00:24:53,148
I wish I could quit right away
because of you.

417
00:24:53,748 --> 00:24:55,388
But the new project
has already started,

418
00:24:55,848 --> 00:24:58,388
and there are a lot of people
who joined because of me.

419
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,858
It would be irresponsible
of me as a director...

420
00:25:01,729 --> 00:25:03,729
to quit for personal reasons.

421
00:25:04,699 --> 00:25:06,499
So I'm going to finish
this project myself.

422
00:25:08,469 --> 00:25:09,928
Okay. Thank you.

423
00:25:11,768 --> 00:25:14,338
I don't want you to thank me.

424
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:16,739
Once this project is over,

425
00:25:16,979 --> 00:25:19,309
I want you to annul our contract.

426
00:25:22,048 --> 00:25:23,579
All right. I'll do that.

427
00:25:25,619 --> 00:25:27,719
I'll do whatever you want.

428
00:25:29,389 --> 00:25:32,188
It's settled then.
I should get going.

429
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:33,959
Wait, Pil Seung.

430
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,029
You...

431
00:25:41,899 --> 00:25:45,138
came up to me one day
and said you wanted to know...

432
00:25:47,238 --> 00:25:49,108
about your birth parents.

433
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:54,279
You asked
if I knew anything about it.

434
00:25:55,609 --> 00:25:57,749
You wanted to know
where you were from.

435
00:25:59,179 --> 00:26:00,348
I'm sorry...

436
00:26:02,449 --> 00:26:04,319
that I didn't tell you anything...

437
00:26:07,788 --> 00:26:08,959
back then.

438
00:26:12,229 --> 00:26:14,168
After you went back home that day,

439
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:19,868
it hurt me so badly.

440
00:26:24,109 --> 00:26:25,838
Why are you telling me this?

441
00:26:26,909 --> 00:26:29,509
You said you didn't know anything
when I came to you.

442
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:32,049
Now that you got caught,

443
00:26:33,018 --> 00:26:35,549
do you want to make excuses
as to why you abandoned me?

444
00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:40,118
You carefully hid the truth
to protect what you had.

445
00:26:41,629 --> 00:26:43,489
So what are you trying to sugarcoat?

446
00:26:44,598 --> 00:26:45,959
That was the day...

447
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:48,898
I forgot about my birth parents.

448
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:53,868
I considered my current parents
to be my birth parents as well.

449
00:26:55,369 --> 00:26:57,338
I may have found out about you,

450
00:26:58,038 --> 00:26:59,378
but it doesn't even shock me.

451
00:27:01,649 --> 00:27:03,309
You didn't leave
a trace of you behind...

452
00:27:04,619 --> 00:27:06,279
because you were worried
I might seek you out.

453
00:27:08,389 --> 00:27:09,648
Did you think...

454
00:27:10,758 --> 00:27:13,259
I would have any feelings
for someone like that?

455
00:27:18,098 --> 00:27:21,398
I saw you as a decent boss
in a professional manner...

456
00:27:22,498 --> 00:27:24,539
and a good friend of my mother's.

457
00:27:26,369 --> 00:27:28,239
But all this time,
you've been deceiving us.

458
00:27:29,709 --> 00:27:32,239
You took a place in our lives
hiding behind a mask,

459
00:27:33,439 --> 00:27:34,948
and that is highly disappointing.

460
00:27:36,578 --> 00:27:38,479
It was inhumane.

461
00:27:42,018 --> 00:27:43,618
To have a better life,

462
00:27:45,788 --> 00:27:47,928
you abandoned me for your own sake.

463
00:27:50,899 --> 00:27:52,858
So keep living your life
in that way.

464
00:28:02,869 --> 00:28:04,539
Gosh, dinner was great.

465
00:28:05,538 --> 00:28:07,908
- Please have this.
- It's watermelon.

466
00:28:09,578 --> 00:28:11,678
- Let me see.
- Here.

467
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:15,348
Let's enjoy.

468
00:28:18,459 --> 00:28:22,088
Watermelon
after spicy chicken soup...

469
00:28:22,129 --> 00:28:23,959
is definitely a palate cleanser.

470
00:28:24,058 --> 00:28:25,729
It's nice and refreshing.

471
00:28:26,899 --> 00:28:30,398
Sun Young, the spicy chicken soup
was to die for.

472
00:28:31,598 --> 00:28:32,769
Was it?

473
00:28:33,439 --> 00:28:34,539
Sun Young.

474
00:28:35,139 --> 00:28:36,938
Things are finally back to normal...

475
00:28:37,338 --> 00:28:39,608
now that you're back on your feet.

476
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:41,909
Sun Young, have some fruit.

477
00:28:41,909 --> 00:28:43,678
It's nice and refreshing.

478
00:28:43,709 --> 00:28:46,019
Sure, Mother.
Have your fill as well.

479
00:28:47,588 --> 00:28:48,719
Gosh.

480
00:28:49,419 --> 00:28:51,888
Is anyone home? It's Ma Ri.

481
00:28:53,518 --> 00:28:56,759
Gosh. Why is Ma Ri here?

482
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:00,698
Hello.

483
00:29:00,899 --> 00:29:02,999
Who are you to come here again?

484
00:29:03,629 --> 00:29:05,698
I told you to stay away!

485
00:29:06,238 --> 00:29:10,284
Well, I... I had something to say.

486
00:29:10,308 --> 00:29:13,848
Hyun Chul, what's wrong with you?
She has something to say.

487
00:29:13,848 --> 00:29:16,578
Ma Ri, welcome.

488
00:29:16,578 --> 00:29:18,418
Come on over.

489
00:29:18,879 --> 00:29:22,249
Have some fruit
and say what's on your mind.

490
00:29:24,719 --> 00:29:28,088
Ms. Sun Young,
can't you forgive my mom?

491
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:33,898
Ma Ri, what is the meaning of this?

492
00:29:35,068 --> 00:29:36,999
What my mom did was wrong.

493
00:29:37,598 --> 00:29:40,615
She abandoned Pil Seung
when he was only a baby,

494
00:29:40,639 --> 00:29:44,309
and I'm disappointed
by how she has been deceiving you.

495
00:29:45,439 --> 00:29:48,878
But I think she had a hard time...

496
00:29:49,048 --> 00:29:51,319
being around Pil Seung as well.

497
00:29:52,018 --> 00:29:54,918
She is having the hardest time
right now.

498
00:29:55,189 --> 00:29:58,289
Look here. Forgiveness, you say?

499
00:29:58,318 --> 00:30:00,559
How dare you ask
for her forgiveness?

500
00:30:00,588 --> 00:30:03,128
Leave if you're only going
to babble nonsense.

501
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:05,999
It's not like anyone here
wants to see you.

502
00:30:06,199 --> 00:30:10,938
Besides, your mom and my wife
are no longer friends.

503
00:30:11,238 --> 00:30:12,298
So leave.

504
00:30:12,298 --> 00:30:14,938
How many times must I tell you
not to come back?

505
00:30:16,738 --> 00:30:17,938
I'm sorry.

506
00:30:19,709 --> 00:30:21,108
- Darn.
- Ma Ri, gosh.

507
00:30:23,209 --> 00:30:24,778
Why would you yell at her?

508
00:30:24,778 --> 00:30:27,519
She was so startled
that she tripped. Unbelievable.

509
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:28,819
Ma Ri!

510
00:30:29,288 --> 00:30:30,448
Ma Ri?

511
00:30:31,518 --> 00:30:32,658
Ma Ri...

512
00:30:33,459 --> 00:30:34,888
Unbelievable.

513
00:30:37,159 --> 00:30:39,029
Ma Ri.

514
00:30:39,058 --> 00:30:40,499
Ma Ri.

515
00:30:40,558 --> 00:30:42,774
Ma Ri, my gosh!

516
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:44,814
Ma Ri...

517
00:30:44,838 --> 00:30:46,999
Ma Ri, are you all right?

518
00:30:48,008 --> 00:30:49,938
Yes, I'm fine.

519
00:30:51,479 --> 00:30:52,678
Ma Ri.

520
00:30:53,308 --> 00:30:54,749
I'm sorry.

521
00:30:55,149 --> 00:30:56,848
I promised to keep it a secret,

522
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,388
but my telling everyone
made life harder for you too.

523
00:31:02,018 --> 00:31:06,088
Gosh, no. It's not your fault.
Please don't apologize.

524
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:08,088
Ma Ri.

525
00:31:08,859 --> 00:31:12,698
You shouldn't be here
at the house anymore. You know that.

526
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:16,799
Yes, I know that.

527
00:31:18,199 --> 00:31:19,499
Take care.

528
00:31:22,139 --> 00:31:24,079
Ma Ri...

529
00:31:36,548 --> 00:31:37,658
Ma Ri?

530
00:31:39,088 --> 00:31:40,219
What's wrong?

531
00:31:42,629 --> 00:31:43,789
Do Jun.

532
00:31:44,699 --> 00:31:46,358
I can't get up.

533
00:31:47,298 --> 00:31:48,969
My legs won't work.

534
00:31:52,038 --> 00:31:54,668
Ma Ri, hold onto me.

535
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:00,779
All right.

536
00:32:28,268 --> 00:32:31,838
Why did you go back there again?

537
00:32:32,139 --> 00:32:35,448
Why would you go there
when his entire family resents me?

538
00:32:37,419 --> 00:32:39,019
That's why I went there.

539
00:32:39,219 --> 00:32:42,348
To beg and ask
for their forgiveness.

540
00:32:43,988 --> 00:32:45,459
Ma Ri, come on.

541
00:32:45,788 --> 00:32:47,689
I should ask for their forgiveness.

542
00:32:47,689 --> 00:32:49,989
You going over there
only breaks my heart.

543
00:32:54,929 --> 00:32:56,069
Ma Ri,

544
00:32:57,328 --> 00:32:58,838
don't go back there again.

545
00:32:59,838 --> 00:33:01,739
No matter how much
you miss Pil Seung,

546
00:33:03,109 --> 00:33:04,709
you shouldn't go back there.

547
00:33:06,479 --> 00:33:07,908
You being there...

548
00:33:10,149 --> 00:33:13,178
will only make it uncomfortable
for him and his family.

549
00:33:14,389 --> 00:33:15,888
We'll only be hurting them.

550
00:33:16,719 --> 00:33:17,959
All right?

551
00:33:21,528 --> 00:33:22,688
Can I...

552
00:33:23,558 --> 00:33:25,398
not go there anymore?

553
00:33:26,558 --> 00:33:29,098
You can never go back there.

554
00:33:34,338 --> 00:33:36,209
Mom, I...

555
00:33:36,669 --> 00:33:40,079
had so much fun
going by Pil Seung's House.

556
00:33:40,949 --> 00:33:43,279
My brother was there,

557
00:33:43,979 --> 00:33:46,179
and so was his grandmother
whom I like...

558
00:33:46,179 --> 00:33:48,088
and also Myung Dong.

559
00:33:48,588 --> 00:33:51,618
I had so much fun
watching TV at his place.

560
00:33:52,818 --> 00:33:56,888
I always enjoyed
Ms. Sun Young's cheonggukjang.

561
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,428
But now,

562
00:34:02,729 --> 00:34:05,299
to think that I can't see
my brother again,

563
00:34:06,568 --> 00:34:10,608
and to think that I can't spend time
with his grandmother makes me sad.

564
00:34:12,808 --> 00:34:15,249
I lost the will to live.

565
00:34:20,319 --> 00:34:23,618
Gosh, I heard Ma Ri was sick.
How bad is it?

566
00:34:26,459 --> 00:34:27,829
She seems to have the shivers.

567
00:34:28,888 --> 00:34:30,758
The shivers? Hold on.

568
00:34:33,598 --> 00:34:34,999
Since when?

569
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,098
Should we call Dr. Kim?

570
00:34:37,299 --> 00:34:40,138
No, Dad. I'm fine.
I took my medicine.

571
00:34:41,209 --> 00:34:42,309
Wait.

572
00:34:42,908 --> 00:34:45,309
Ma Ri, have you been crying?

573
00:34:46,308 --> 00:34:48,079
Oh, that?

574
00:34:48,848 --> 00:34:52,479
I woke up from a nightmare earlier,

575
00:34:52,479 --> 00:34:54,649
and now I can't stop crying.

576
00:35:03,459 --> 00:35:04,629
Sun Young.

577
00:35:05,459 --> 00:35:09,169
Ma Ri is having a hard time.

578
00:35:12,098 --> 00:35:15,339
She's fond of you, Ms. So,

579
00:35:16,538 --> 00:35:18,809
and also Pil Seung's aunt.

580
00:35:20,209 --> 00:35:21,879
She misses Pil Seung.

581
00:35:22,948 --> 00:35:25,118
That's why she loved coming here,

582
00:35:25,118 --> 00:35:26,879
but now that she can't come over,

583
00:35:27,848 --> 00:35:30,189
she's lying in bed
and refusing to eat.

584
00:35:31,419 --> 00:35:32,559
Unbelievable.

585
00:35:33,218 --> 00:35:36,129
Why must we take this from you?

586
00:35:36,788 --> 00:35:38,559
I don't even want to yell at you.

587
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,758
I can't stand your guts, so leave.

588
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:45,638
Sun Young, please. Wait.

589
00:35:46,069 --> 00:35:49,068
Throw profanities at me.
Hit me all you want.

590
00:35:49,239 --> 00:35:52,209
But please, just my Ma Ri...

591
00:35:52,439 --> 00:35:53,778
Can't you at least...

592
00:35:54,848 --> 00:35:56,508
go easy on Ma Ri?

593
00:35:59,779 --> 00:36:01,718
Can't you allow that?

594
00:36:03,748 --> 00:36:06,488
After all, Ma Ri...

595
00:36:08,259 --> 00:36:09,959
is Pil Seung's sister.

596
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:12,459
What?

597
00:36:13,229 --> 00:36:14,568
What did you just say?

598
00:36:15,029 --> 00:36:16,729
- What did you just say?
- Honey, don't.

599
00:36:16,928 --> 00:36:19,468
You are one shameless woman.

600
00:36:20,669 --> 00:36:22,738
It takes one to abandon her child
at a friend's house.

601
00:36:23,609 --> 00:36:25,979
Yes, you're right.

602
00:36:27,038 --> 00:36:29,048
I'm shameless indeed.

603
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:32,718
I'm worthy of being stoned.

604
00:36:32,879 --> 00:36:35,718
But... My Ma Ri...

605
00:36:36,348 --> 00:36:38,388
Ma Ri didn't do anything wrong.

606
00:36:39,589 --> 00:36:40,789
Unbelievable.

607
00:36:43,089 --> 00:36:44,829
Leave this instant.

608
00:36:45,098 --> 00:36:48,499
Honey, there's no need for us
to listen to this shameless woman.

609
00:36:49,029 --> 00:36:51,539
Have you no conscience?

610
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,368
I'm sorry.

611
00:36:56,709 --> 00:36:57,879
I'm sorry.

612
00:37:01,808 --> 00:37:05,079
I don't want to forgive
Sun Young's friend,

613
00:37:06,649 --> 00:37:08,318
but I feel bad for Ma Ri.

614
00:37:09,388 --> 00:37:11,048
I feel terrible.

615
00:37:12,089 --> 00:37:13,289
Right, Mom?

616
00:37:14,788 --> 00:37:16,658
Unbelievable.

617
00:37:16,959 --> 00:37:18,158
Gosh.

618
00:37:19,299 --> 00:37:21,468
She must be heartbroken...

619
00:37:21,468 --> 00:37:23,669
not to be able to eat anything.

620
00:37:25,638 --> 00:37:27,169
My gosh.

621
00:37:27,739 --> 00:37:31,508
Thinking about Ma Ri's situation
breaks my heart.

622
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,960
Who is it?

623
00:37:45,701 --> 00:37:47,960
I'm here to visit Ms. Ma Ri.

624
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:51,400
I'm Ko Pil Seung's grandmother.

625
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,571
What am I supposed to do?

626
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,210
Ma Ri.

627
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:05,411
I heard you were sick...

628
00:38:06,121 --> 00:38:08,121
and haven't been able to eat.

629
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:10,790
I remembered...

630
00:38:11,391 --> 00:38:15,121
how you said you loved corn,
so I steamed some for you.

631
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,360
Grandma,

632
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,431
thank you for visiting.

633
00:38:20,561 --> 00:38:24,031
I feel so much better
now that you're here.

634
00:38:25,271 --> 00:38:26,371
Ma Ri.

635
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:30,440
I'm grateful that you understand.

636
00:38:31,641 --> 00:38:32,810
But...

637
00:38:33,581 --> 00:38:36,451
it breaks my heart
to hear that you're sick...

638
00:38:37,311 --> 00:38:39,650
and that you haven't been
eating anything.

639
00:38:40,681 --> 00:38:44,150
At times like this,
you must eat well and stay healthy.

640
00:38:45,661 --> 00:38:46,761
I'm sorry.

641
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:50,831
But I can't eat anything right now.

642
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,161
I can't swallow.

643
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:59,101
Goodness. What are we
going to do about you?

644
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:03,340
Ma Ri, my gosh.

645
00:39:07,911 --> 00:39:09,911
We could cause
permanent damage at this rate.

646
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:16,051
What do you mean, Mom?

647
00:39:16,251 --> 00:39:18,020
Why should we go easy on Ma Ri?

648
00:39:18,391 --> 00:39:21,190
She hasn't been able
to eat anything,

649
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:23,860
so I brought over some steamed corn.

650
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:27,230
That poor thing.

651
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:30,230
I couldn't bear the sight of her.

652
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:34,440
She knows she can't see
her brother anymore...

653
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,840
and that she shouldn't
come by our house.

654
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,110
But the thought of that
breaks her heart.

655
00:39:39,581 --> 00:39:41,641
She was thrilled
to have gained a brother,

656
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,650
so to think
she can't see him again...

657
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,121
"I don't have the will to live."

658
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,891
That's what she said
when she burst into tears.

659
00:39:52,121 --> 00:39:54,661
I felt so bad for the girl...

660
00:39:54,661 --> 00:39:56,690
that I cried with her.

661
00:39:56,931 --> 00:39:58,060
Unbelievable.

662
00:39:58,431 --> 00:40:01,431
Who are you feeling sorry for?

663
00:40:01,501 --> 00:40:03,471
The one who has it the worst...

664
00:40:03,471 --> 00:40:06,001
is my wife who was betrayed...

665
00:40:06,001 --> 00:40:07,670
by her best friend.

666
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,741
Darn it.

667
00:40:14,641 --> 00:40:15,741
Sun Young.

668
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:19,820
I know very well that Ma Ri's mom
is a wicked witch...

669
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,020
who deserves to burn.

670
00:40:21,721 --> 00:40:23,391
I hate her guts just as much.

671
00:40:23,451 --> 00:40:25,250
The thought of her
still gives me the chills.

672
00:40:26,021 --> 00:40:28,021
But not Ma Ri.

673
00:40:28,021 --> 00:40:29,661
She did nothing wrong.

674
00:40:30,431 --> 00:40:33,061
She's involuntarily drawn
to her sibling...

675
00:40:33,061 --> 00:40:34,701
and is fond of her brother.

676
00:40:35,001 --> 00:40:38,000
She loves having Pil Seung
for a brother.

677
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,170
It's inhumane of us...

678
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:43,911
to stop them
from having a relationship.

679
00:40:45,811 --> 00:40:47,040
Sun Young.

680
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:51,150
You must be upset
to hear me say this,

681
00:40:51,851 --> 00:40:52,951
but...

682
00:40:54,021 --> 00:40:56,650
I'm going to tell Pil Seung
that Ma Ri is hurting...

683
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:00,261
and that he should
stay in touch with her.

684
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,420
I'm going to tell him that.

685
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:04,261
Mother, please.

686
00:41:05,391 --> 00:41:07,701
To him, Ma Ri...

687
00:41:07,701 --> 00:41:11,170
is his one and only sibling.

688
00:41:11,371 --> 00:41:14,141
If you keep refusing
to accept Ma Ri,

689
00:41:14,141 --> 00:41:16,810
you'll be hurting Pil Seung as well.

690
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,481
She's his one and only sister.

691
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,820
A sister who needs constant care.

692
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,621
Not being able to see her...

693
00:41:28,121 --> 00:41:31,290
will also break Pil Seung's heart.

694
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:32,821
Don't you agree?

695
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,060
Well, Sun Young.

696
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:38,790
I agree with Mom on this...

697
00:41:39,201 --> 00:41:41,460
about letting Ma Ri off the hook.

698
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,500
It's better for Pil Seung.

699
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:58,181
Ma Ri's sick?

700
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,227
Did you meet her recently?

701
00:42:02,251 --> 00:42:03,351
Yes.

702
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:07,190
Her mom came by the house
to tell us about her being ill...

703
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,690
and asked in tears
if we could go easy on her.

704
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,031
How could I stay away
after hearing that?

705
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,201
I went to visit her
to see how she was doing.

706
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:24,340
She hadn't been eating anything
like her mother said...

707
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,281
and was close to fainting.

708
00:42:28,811 --> 00:42:31,281
She loved the idea
of having a brother...

709
00:42:32,251 --> 00:42:34,750
and was now sad because
she couldn't see you anymore.

710
00:42:35,681 --> 00:42:37,551
She has lost the will to live.

711
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:40,991
Did Ma Ri...

712
00:42:42,021 --> 00:42:43,230
Did she say that?

713
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:01,411
Ma Ri.

714
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:05,480
Ma Ri, are you all right?

715
00:43:06,481 --> 00:43:07,581
Yes.

716
00:43:10,791 --> 00:43:13,190
I'm sorry, Pil Seung.
I know this is wrong.

717
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,721
I'm sorry for sneaking a glance
at you like this.

718
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:18,190
What?

719
00:43:18,331 --> 00:43:20,760
I'm sorry. I came by
because I missed you so much,

720
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,500
but I won't come by again.

721
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:24,871
Ma Ri, wait.

722
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,741
Can we talk?

723
00:43:33,681 --> 00:43:34,781
Ma Ri.

724
00:43:35,951 --> 00:43:37,281
I heard you were ill.

725
00:43:37,411 --> 00:43:39,880
No, I'm doing fine.

726
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,751
- Ma Ri...
- I won't...

727
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:48,420
come by to see you again.

728
00:43:48,891 --> 00:43:50,090
I promise.

729
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,101
Ma Ri.

730
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,831
I also thought about you a lot.

731
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,340
About me?

732
00:44:03,541 --> 00:44:05,310
In what way?

733
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:09,210
From the moment we first met,

734
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:10,650
you didn't seem like a stranger.

735
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:13,551
When you followed me around,

736
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:16,451
you seemed
like my cute little sister.

737
00:44:17,451 --> 00:44:18,590
Really?

738
00:44:26,431 --> 00:44:29,261
I hate the fact
that your mom also gave birth to me,

739
00:44:31,431 --> 00:44:33,201
and I can't forgive her.

740
00:44:34,041 --> 00:44:35,301
You know why.

741
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:39,911
Yes, I know. And it's only natural.

742
00:44:40,581 --> 00:44:44,150
I still can't forgive her either.

743
00:44:46,721 --> 00:44:48,551
But you're my little sister.

744
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:53,221
And I like having you as my sister.

745
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:56,560
Really?

746
00:44:59,831 --> 00:45:01,730
That's why
I'd like to see you at times.

747
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,670
Because you're my sister.

748
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,741
So what do you say?

749
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,411
I'd love that too. I really would.

750
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,511
Thanks, Pil Seung.

751
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:17,351
Thank you so much.

752
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:26,991
What did you just say?

753
00:45:27,661 --> 00:45:29,630
You'll still see Ma Ri?

754
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:32,731
Hey, Pil Seung. How could you say that
in front of Mom?

755
00:45:32,731 --> 00:45:34,031
One moment.

756
00:45:34,561 --> 00:45:36,431
Pil Seung isn't done talking yet.

757
00:45:38,501 --> 00:45:40,101
Okay, Pil Seung.
Go ahead and say it.

758
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,940
I have no intention of forgiving
Ms. Jang either.

759
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,641
But the fact that
Ma Ri is my sister...

760
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,980
is an undeniable fact.

761
00:45:52,681 --> 00:45:55,480
Ma Ri came to see me earlier,
to see me in secret.

762
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:59,920
I don't want to ignore
that pitiful sentiment.

763
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:02,460
Goodness, gracious.

764
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:06,400
She used to chase after you,
calling your name all the time.

765
00:46:06,661 --> 00:46:10,331
Ma Ri went to see you
when she's so ill?

766
00:46:10,831 --> 00:46:12,031
Gosh.

767
00:46:12,601 --> 00:46:15,300
What should we do
about that poor thing?

768
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,641
My goodness.

769
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:20,781
Mom, just be quiet.
Stop making things worse.

770
00:46:22,811 --> 00:46:24,980
Mom, Dad.

771
00:46:25,951 --> 00:46:27,781
I still want to
get your permission...

772
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,991
to see Ma Ri.

773
00:46:31,391 --> 00:46:34,460
If you don't want me to,
I won't see her behind your backs.

774
00:46:38,891 --> 00:46:40,031
Okay.

775
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,230
Go ahead and see her.

776
00:46:43,871 --> 00:46:46,340
Honey, will you be okay?

777
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:52,770
If I tell Pil Seung...

778
00:46:53,541 --> 00:46:55,581
to ignore his sister, Ma Ri,

779
00:46:56,251 --> 00:46:58,150
how would I be any different
from Soo Yeon?

780
00:46:58,311 --> 00:46:59,880
Ma Ri has done nothing wrong.

781
00:47:03,521 --> 00:47:04,621
Mom.

782
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,360
Do what your heart tells you to,
Pil Seung.

783
00:47:12,161 --> 00:47:13,331
Thank you.

784
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:27,481
Yes, I'm on my way out now too.

785
00:47:27,481 --> 00:47:29,281
Okay, I'll see you at the set.

786
00:47:35,221 --> 00:47:36,351
Yes?

787
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:43,790
So, I know you have a shoot.

788
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:46,031
Could we talk for a minute?

789
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:49,531
Yes, go ahead.

790
00:47:51,731 --> 00:47:53,101
I heard...

791
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,400
from Ma Ri...

792
00:47:56,471 --> 00:47:57,710
that you said...

793
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:00,610
you'd accept her as your sister.

794
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,051
Pil Seung.

795
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:05,181
Thank you so much.

796
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:09,221
Just because I meet with Ma Ri...

797
00:48:09,951 --> 00:48:12,051
doesn't mean I've changed my mind
about you, Ms. Jang.

798
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:14,391
My feelings for Ma Ri...

799
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,230
have nothing to do with you.

800
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:19,261
Bye, then.

801
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:29,500
Still, thank you, Pil Seung.

802
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:37,710
Our elders from both of our families
were good friends.

803
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:40,250
But knowing that our Jin Dan
and Tae Hee...

804
00:48:40,521 --> 00:48:43,190
have met as a good match...

805
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:47,221
and that our two families
will become one from now on...

806
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:49,690
makes me so happy.

807
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:54,801
Chairman Kim, our Jin Dan
may be lacking in many ways,

808
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:56,331
but please look kindly upon him.

809
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:59,371
Well,
our Tae Hee is lacking as well.

810
00:48:59,471 --> 00:49:01,040
I hope you cherish her as we do.

811
00:49:02,701 --> 00:49:05,271
Then, shall we have some wine?

812
00:49:05,271 --> 00:49:06,380
All right.

813
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:08,940
- Right. Cheers.
- Right.

814
00:49:09,981 --> 00:49:11,510
Cheers. Gosh.

815
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:13,497
The kids make
such a beautiful couple.

816
00:49:13,521 --> 00:49:15,150
- They're meant to be.
- Right.

817
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:26,190
Honey,
why don't you talk to Dr. Kim...

818
00:49:26,661 --> 00:49:28,761
and get a health check-up?

819
00:49:29,971 --> 00:49:31,130
While you're at it, you could stay
in the hospital for a few days...

820
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:32,400
and get a shot...

821
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:34,270
to regain your strength.

822
00:49:36,871 --> 00:49:40,480
I'm just a bit tired today.
I'll be fine after some rest.

823
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:47,081
You're feeling so down lately
because of Sun Young, right?

824
00:49:48,981 --> 00:49:53,391
Is she still mad at you?

825
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:58,130
It's not like that.
You shouldn't give it any thought.

826
00:50:06,371 --> 00:50:07,500
Honey.

827
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:10,571
I'm your husband.

828
00:50:12,541 --> 00:50:16,551
I don't know what you've done wrong
to Sun Young,

829
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:19,011
but I could at least...

830
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,781
console you.

831
00:50:22,951 --> 00:50:24,920
I'm that kind of person for you.

832
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:28,860
So, can't you at least...

833
00:50:29,791 --> 00:50:32,090
tell me everything?

834
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,071
Honey.

835
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:45,511
Don't ask me anything,

836
00:50:47,181 --> 00:50:51,011
and please just let me be
for the time being.

837
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:55,880
I feel so sorry to you already.

838
00:50:56,351 --> 00:50:58,150
What can I do
if you keep acting like this?

839
00:51:11,471 --> 00:51:13,971
Oh, my! Director!

840
00:51:13,971 --> 00:51:16,440
How have you been?

841
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:18,210
Grandma, you're here.

842
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:22,510
Goodness, seeing you here,
you look even more handsome!

843
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:24,581
Is that so? Thank you.

844
00:51:29,181 --> 00:51:31,221
Grandma, I told you, didn't I?

845
00:51:31,351 --> 00:51:34,060
You have to stay quiet
while I'm working.

846
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:36,060
That's the only way
you can come along with me.

847
00:51:36,391 --> 00:51:37,561
Grandma, you understand, right?

848
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:39,436
All right.

849
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:43,371
I'll stay right by
this man's side...

850
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:45,270
and stay quiet.

851
00:51:46,601 --> 00:51:48,141
Right.

852
00:51:50,311 --> 00:51:53,411
My grandma's dementia symptoms
have gotten worse.

853
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:56,380
I've decided to have her stay
with me in Seoul for now.

854
00:51:57,481 --> 00:52:02,451
I'm sorry, but would it be okay to
come to the set with my grandma?

855
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:04,520
Of course.

856
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:07,221
She's not someone who would
get in the way. It's fine.

857
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:09,590
Don't you worry about that.

858
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:12,431
I'll be really careful
so she doesn't disrupt the shoot.

859
00:52:12,431 --> 00:52:14,331
Okay. Get ready for the shoot.

860
00:52:15,561 --> 00:52:16,801
Excuse me, Director.

861
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:20,741
Thank you so much.

862
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:24,840
You must've been flustered
because of my grandma's symptoms.

863
00:52:25,311 --> 00:52:28,681
But you took good care of Grandma
and brought her home.

864
00:52:29,141 --> 00:52:30,551
Of course I should've done that.

865
00:52:30,851 --> 00:52:32,110
Don't worry about it.

866
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:37,721
Gosh.

867
00:52:39,521 --> 00:52:43,090
His heart must be breaking too
after finding out about his birth mom.

868
00:52:43,831 --> 00:52:45,460
But he's not even letting on.

869
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,630
And he even looked after Grandma
amid all that.

870
00:52:50,771 --> 00:52:53,801
I really don't think he's a bad guy.

871
00:52:56,541 --> 00:52:59,210
But Mom keeps saying he's a bad guy.

872
00:52:59,541 --> 00:53:01,440
Which one is the truth?

873
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:07,181
I'd know what's what
only when my memory comes back.

874
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:11,821
Why aren't my memories coming back?

875
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:20,061
("The House of Roses")

876
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,900
We just need to see your emotions
for that scene.

877
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,000
Oh, my.

878
00:53:26,431 --> 00:53:29,000
I think that director...

879
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:32,040
likes our Ji Young.

880
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:35,781
What? Oh, right. Yes, Grandma.

881
00:53:39,351 --> 00:53:41,380
- Ji Young.
- Yes?

882
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:45,221
Should I tell you a secret?

883
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:49,060
What secret?

884
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:53,060
You know that handsome director?

885
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:55,560
That director likes you.

886
00:53:56,931 --> 00:54:00,040
Gosh, no way. That's not true.

887
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,400
As if it's not.

888
00:54:02,701 --> 00:54:05,210
You might fool a ghost, but not me.

889
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:07,911
You like that director too,
don't you?

890
00:54:08,181 --> 00:54:10,551
My goodness.

891
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:12,750
What are you...

892
00:54:12,851 --> 00:54:14,981
What on earth are you saying?

893
00:54:14,981 --> 00:54:16,991
Who are you saying that I like?

894
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:19,391
- No! Never.
- "No!"

895
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:21,190
- You're talking nonsense!
- "No!"

896
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:23,460
"No! Never."

897
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:28,460
Look at her babble.

898
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,340
What?

899
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:39,241
Wait, where did Grandma go?

900
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:41,681
Grandma.

901
00:54:43,041 --> 00:54:44,327
Grandma!

902
00:54:44,351 --> 00:54:46,126
- Excuse me, Grandma.
- Yes?

903
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:50,190
So, don't you remember
anyone's phone number?

904
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:53,491
I left my phone at home,
so I don't know.

905
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,931
Everyone's numbers are on my phone.

906
00:54:57,530 --> 00:55:00,130
I even forget things that happened
an hour ago.

907
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:02,860
How would I remember
all of those phone numbers?

908
00:55:04,331 --> 00:55:06,840
Then, is this your house, Grandma?

909
00:55:07,041 --> 00:55:10,000
No, my house is near the sea.

910
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:12,540
Goodness, this is driving me crazy.

911
00:55:13,681 --> 00:55:17,581
Then, Grandma,
why did you ask to come here?

912
00:55:17,581 --> 00:55:20,121
Grandma, do you have dementia?

913
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:21,821
"Dementia?"

914
00:55:22,081 --> 00:55:24,451
Who are you saying has dementia?

915
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:26,351
I'm totally fine!

916
00:55:26,351 --> 00:55:28,521
Grandma,
let me just take you to the police.

917
00:55:28,521 --> 00:55:29,920
- Wait. No.
- To the police.

918
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,360
- No. I'm sorry.
- Ma'am.

919
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:34,960
My goodness. It's you, Director Ko.

920
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,670
- Do you know this lady?
- Yes.

921
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:37,971
Director Ko.

922
00:55:37,971 --> 00:55:41,601
This man here is trying to take me
to the police station...

923
00:55:41,601 --> 00:55:43,471
because I didn't pay for the taxi.

924
00:55:43,471 --> 00:55:45,670
Director Ko, please let me
borrow some money.

925
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:48,710
I'll pay you back with the money
from selling kalguksu.

926
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:51,311
I'm sorry, sir.

927
00:55:51,311 --> 00:55:53,520
- All right.
- Happy now?

928
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:55,781
- Bye.
- You should go now.

929
00:56:00,561 --> 00:56:01,960
I'm sorry.

930
00:56:03,291 --> 00:56:05,161
Ma'am, where's Ji Young?

931
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:08,630
My Ji Young? She's home.

932
00:56:09,661 --> 00:56:12,170
Did you come here by yourself? Why?

933
00:56:13,331 --> 00:56:15,400
Listen, Director Ko.

934
00:56:15,541 --> 00:56:18,311
There's something I should tell you,

935
00:56:18,311 --> 00:56:20,480
so I'm here to see you.

936
00:56:21,081 --> 00:56:23,480
Something to tell me? What is it?

937
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:25,451
Director Ko.

938
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:29,420
Well, this is supposed
to be a secret,

939
00:56:30,951 --> 00:56:33,821
but Ji Young has a crush...

940
00:56:34,291 --> 00:56:36,020
on you.

941
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:38,761
Pardon?

942
00:56:39,061 --> 00:56:42,101
Grandma!

943
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:44,971
Grandma!

944
00:56:44,971 --> 00:56:46,071
Ji Young.

945
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:47,800
Ji Young, what are you doing here?

946
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:50,771
Ms. Baek, my grandmother is missing.

947
00:56:50,771 --> 00:56:53,010
She disappeared
while I was in the bathroom.

948
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:55,210
My goodness. Seriously?

949
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:57,050
I will go this way.

950
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:59,510
You should look for her over there.

951
00:56:59,510 --> 00:57:01,221
Okay. Hurry and go.

952
00:57:01,221 --> 00:57:03,650
My goodness. Where did the lady go?

953
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:09,761
Hello, Director Ko.

954
00:57:11,391 --> 00:57:14,400
What? My grandmother is there?

955
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,871
(Cold jjolmyeon)

956
00:57:17,501 --> 00:57:18,730
Grandma!

957
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,070
Hey, Ji Young.

958
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:25,617
Grandma, you can't just go out
without telling me like this.

959
00:57:25,641 --> 00:57:28,240
I thought you went missing,
so I almost passed out.

960
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,650
Do you want me
to die of shock or what?

961
00:57:31,081 --> 00:57:32,281
I'm sorry.

962
00:57:32,610 --> 00:57:34,920
But I had to come here...

963
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:37,321
because I had something
to tell Director Ko.

964
00:57:37,391 --> 00:57:40,090
I was going to make it quick
while you were in the shower,

965
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:42,320
but I didn't know
things would come to this.

966
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,420
What?

967
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:47,261
So what is it
you wanted to tell Director Ko?

968
00:57:53,501 --> 00:57:56,071
Director Ko,
what did my grandmother say?

969
00:57:56,141 --> 00:57:57,371
What is it?

970
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:00,940
What?

971
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:03,511
What is going on here?

972
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:06,150
Why aren't you two saying anything?

973
00:58:06,581 --> 00:58:07,681
Ji Young.

974
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:13,150
That's a secret
between Director Ko and me.

975
00:58:13,561 --> 00:58:15,891
Grandma, what secret?

976
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,460
Director Ko,

977
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:21,261
you should never tell Ji Young...

978
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:24,531
about what I told you.

979
00:58:24,931 --> 00:58:27,840
She will be embarrassed
if she finds out.

980
00:58:28,201 --> 00:58:30,710
It's between you and me,
Director Ko.

981
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:32,710
Okay. I'll keep it a secret.

982
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:33,810
All right.

983
00:58:35,481 --> 00:58:38,010
What? What are you talking about?

984
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:40,380
What is it?
Why would I be embarrassed?

985
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:42,251
You'll be embarrassed
if you find out.

986
00:58:42,251 --> 00:58:43,621
Just sit here
and have some tteokbokki.

987
00:58:43,621 --> 00:58:44,750
What?

988
00:58:45,721 --> 00:58:47,060
What is it?

989
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:51,331
You have to tell me.
What is all this about?

990
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,931
Director Ko must be
feeling frustrated right now.

991
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:03,871
I feel so bad
that he keeps doing me a favor.

992
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:08,210
But I can't ask if he's doing okay.

993
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:11,150
I can't tell him
that I know what he's going through.

994
00:59:11,751 --> 00:59:14,250
I can't even offer him
words of consolation.

995
00:59:14,981 --> 00:59:16,851
What am I supposed to do?

996
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:21,920
(Goban Restaurant)

997
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,060
All right.

998
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:28,130
- What?
- Oh, dear.

999
00:59:31,371 --> 00:59:32,531
Hello.

1000
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:36,641
Hello, Chairman Gong.

1001
00:59:37,041 --> 00:59:39,471
What brings you here?

1002
00:59:39,811 --> 00:59:41,340
I had to attend a seminar,

1003
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:43,141
so I couldn't be here
for the grand opening the other day.

1004
00:59:43,951 --> 00:59:45,510
So I wanted to come here...

1005
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:47,851
and have a talk with Ms. Kim.

1006
00:59:48,221 --> 00:59:51,221
I knew you were busy with work,
but I just had to come.

1007
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:52,520
Okay.

1008
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:57,630
My wife is...

1009
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,730
having a hard time
because of the issue about you.

1010
01:00:02,931 --> 01:00:04,301
She's not feeling well too.

1011
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:09,270
I asked
what happened between you two,

1012
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,070
but she wouldn't tell me.

1013
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:14,310
She just says she's to blame.

1014
01:00:16,610 --> 01:00:18,980
I was always jealous of her...

1015
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:22,181
for having...

1016
01:00:22,751 --> 01:00:25,391
such a nice and close friend
like you.

1017
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:28,491
I've watched
how things were between you two.

1018
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:32,031
So I want to know
what happened between you two...

1019
01:00:33,391 --> 01:00:34,801
that led you to this.

1020
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:35,960
You should...

1021
01:00:37,601 --> 01:00:39,500
hear that from Soo Yeon.

1022
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:41,971
I don't want to talk about it.

1023
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:44,471
And...

1024
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,911
things are over
between Soo Yeon and me.

1025
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:54,750
Now that I see you being like this,

1026
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,190
I can tell it's something serious.

1027
01:00:59,521 --> 01:01:01,690
Soo Yeon wouldn't tell me.

1028
01:01:05,490 --> 01:01:06,590
Is it...

1029
01:01:07,231 --> 01:01:09,360
something I shouldn't know about?

1030
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:32,621
Honey.

1031
01:01:37,331 --> 01:01:38,431
Here.

1032
01:01:46,331 --> 01:01:47,741
What is this?

1033
01:01:49,771 --> 01:01:52,040
I was going to give it to you
on our wedding anniversary,

1034
01:01:52,911 --> 01:01:54,511
but I guess you can open it early.

1035
01:01:55,311 --> 01:01:56,411
Open it.

1036
01:02:03,851 --> 01:02:06,551
What do you think?
Do you like the watch?

1037
01:02:07,291 --> 01:02:08,420
Try it on.

1038
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:12,860
I gave it a lot of thought
before choosing it.

1039
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,201
I like it.

1040
01:02:17,831 --> 01:02:19,031
Thank you.

1041
01:02:21,141 --> 01:02:24,241
But why are you being like this?

1042
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:27,911
You seemed to be feeling down,

1043
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:29,641
so I wanted to make you feel better.

1044
01:02:33,081 --> 01:02:34,221
Honey.

1045
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:37,391
Actually,

1046
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:42,290
I just went to see Ms. Kim.

1047
01:02:45,530 --> 01:02:46,630
What?

1048
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:50,301
Why would you meet Sun Young?

1049
01:02:51,070 --> 01:02:53,130
Obviously,
you're having a hard time,

1050
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:56,440
but I can't help you
unless I know what this is about.

1051
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:01,241
So I wanted to know what happened.

1052
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:03,610
If you did anything wrong,

1053
01:03:03,981 --> 01:03:06,581
I was going to offer an apology.

1054
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:12,321
But Ms. Kim wouldn't say anything.

1055
01:03:13,221 --> 01:03:15,161
She just told me to ask you.

1056
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:18,460
Why would you do that
when I didn't even ask you?

1057
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:20,630
Why would you apologize to her...

1058
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:22,701
when you didn't do anything wrong?

1059
01:03:22,831 --> 01:03:24,731
I don't know what it is,

1060
01:03:24,731 --> 01:03:26,630
but if I apologized to her for you,

1061
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,971
I thought
it would make her feel better.

1062
01:03:30,771 --> 01:03:32,411
I'm your husband.

1063
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:36,710
There's nothing I wouldn't do
if it was to help you.

1064
01:03:37,681 --> 01:03:38,781
But...

1065
01:03:40,351 --> 01:03:41,451
Ms. Kim...

1066
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:44,491
didn't want to talk to me,
which was quite upsetting.

1067
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:49,090
Honey, why did you go there
in the first place?

1068
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:53,831
No one knows you better than I do.

1069
01:03:55,061 --> 01:03:56,460
Even if you did something wrong,

1070
01:03:57,030 --> 01:03:59,071
I'm sure it wasn't anything serious.

1071
01:03:59,831 --> 01:04:01,741
That's not who you are.

1072
01:04:03,141 --> 01:04:04,710
That's who I am.

1073
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:06,940
I'm someone who would do
something terribly wrong.

1074
01:04:07,541 --> 01:04:09,141
Do you have any idea what I did?

1075
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:12,110
Do you even realize
how horrible I am?

1076
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:14,920
Do you know what I did to you?

1077
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:17,051
I deceived you!

1078
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:32,030
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1079
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:08,741
There's no way things can
work out for Director Ko and me.

1080
01:05:09,070 --> 01:05:11,510
I'm not supposed
to have feelings for Director Ko.

1081
01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:14,210
It's just mean of you not to show
your grandmother around Seoul.

1082
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:17,141
So I'm going to show her
around the city as a friend.

1083
01:05:17,141 --> 01:05:20,280
I need to meet Ji Young,

1084
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,026
but she's not answering my calls.

1085
01:05:22,050 --> 01:05:25,291
Ms. Baek,
will you call her out for me?

1086
01:05:25,291 --> 01:05:29,221
Something bad
must've happened recently.

1087
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:32,261
Every heartache
is meaningful in a way,

1088
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:35,677
and people grow and mature
by overcoming their pain.

1089
01:05:35,701 --> 01:05:37,271
I don't know what's been going on,

1090
01:05:37,271 --> 01:05:38,831
but I hope
that you can shake it off...

1091
01:05:38,831 --> 01:05:40,471
and stay strong.

1092
01:05:41,041 --> 01:05:43,101
