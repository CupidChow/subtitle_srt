1
00:00:00,107 --> 00:00:07,422
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:08,521 --> 00:00:10,451
What is it? Ask anything.

3
00:00:11,251 --> 00:00:12,321
Director Ko.

4
00:00:13,191 --> 00:00:14,961
Am I Park Do Ra?

5
00:00:23,531 --> 00:00:24,601
What?

6
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,741
Did you know that I was Park Do Ra?

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,680
Ji...

8
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:42,021
Ji Young.

9
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,320
You didn't, did you?

10
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,790
You didn't know.

11
00:00:50,591 --> 00:00:52,161
Tell me you didn't know.

12
00:00:53,031 --> 00:00:55,731
Director Ko, you didn't know
that I was Park Do Ra.

13
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,540
Do Ra.

14
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:05,870
What happened?

15
00:01:07,271 --> 00:01:08,580
How did you find out?

16
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,450
Director Ko.

17
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:15,650
You knew that I was Park Do Ra.

18
00:01:17,081 --> 00:01:18,191
Then...

19
00:01:19,721 --> 00:01:22,320
Then why have you been playing dumb?

20
00:01:24,391 --> 00:01:27,461
Why didn't you tell me
that I was Park Do Ra?

21
00:01:27,461 --> 00:01:28,700
Why not?

22
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:29,930
Do Ra.

23
00:01:31,971 --> 00:01:33,430
Are your memories back?

24
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,101
Do you remember everything?

25
00:01:37,101 --> 00:01:38,471
I haven't regained my memories.

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,340
Ms. Baek told me
that I was Park Do Ra.

27
00:01:44,611 --> 00:01:47,280
What if Ms. Baek
hadn't recognized me?

28
00:01:47,711 --> 00:01:50,180
I would've kept living my life
not knowing about my family.

29
00:01:51,021 --> 00:01:52,420
How could you have deceived me...

30
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,760
just because
I had no memories of myself?

31
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,120
Do Ra... I mean, Ji Young.

32
00:01:57,991 --> 00:02:00,790
Let me explain.
I'll tell you everything.

33
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:02,730
I...

34
00:02:03,961 --> 00:02:06,930
I thought you had no idea.

35
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,141
But how...

36
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,471
How could you?

37
00:02:14,241 --> 00:02:15,241
Ji Young.

38
00:02:16,111 --> 00:02:18,650
I didn't know at first.
It didn't even dawn on me.

39
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,951
I kept seeing Do Ra in you,

40
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,780
and I blamed myself for it.

41
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,650
I believed I was imagining things
because I missed her so much.

42
00:02:27,491 --> 00:02:29,791
When you were hospitalized
for your injury,

43
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,491
I saw the star tattoo on your ankle.

44
00:02:32,961 --> 00:02:35,461
It was part of a matching set
that she and I got together.

45
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,030
After seeing that,

46
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:40,771
I knew you had to be Do Ra.

47
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,141
I ordered a DNA test with samples
from you and Ms. Baek...

48
00:02:44,141 --> 00:02:46,440
But I was hospitalized
a long time ago.

49
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,350
How could you have kept it from me
all this time?

50
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,511
How could you do this to me?

51
00:02:54,921 --> 00:02:58,021
How could you make a fool out of me?

52
00:03:01,321 --> 00:03:02,521
At first,

53
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,590
I wanted to tell you who you were.

54
00:03:06,331 --> 00:03:08,361
I wanted you
to regain your memories.

55
00:03:10,201 --> 00:03:12,301
But then you fainted
at that hotel...

56
00:03:12,301 --> 00:03:15,301
and fragments of your past memories
only made you suffer...

57
00:03:15,301 --> 00:03:16,741
which is why I couldn't tell you.

58
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:19,011
That's why I chose...

59
00:03:19,611 --> 00:03:21,581
to let you live as Kim Ji Young.

60
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,951
You were in so much pain
that you chose to die,

61
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:28,921
and I couldn't bring you
into that life again.

62
00:03:28,921 --> 00:03:30,150
For you, I...

63
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,150
Don't speak nonsense...

64
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,451
about keeping the truth from me
for my sake.

65
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,120
Who gave you the right
to make decisions about my life?

66
00:03:38,461 --> 00:03:40,291
While not knowing who I was,

67
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:43,500
I fought my own mom
and pulled at her hair.

68
00:03:44,461 --> 00:03:46,831
I cursed my mom in her face...

69
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,171
and walked by my brother
whom I didn't recognize.

70
00:03:49,701 --> 00:03:50,900
Is that right?

71
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,870
Is that kind of life a happy one?

72
00:03:54,141 --> 00:03:56,440
Did that seem normal to you?

73
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:00,810
Ji Young.

74
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,280
Do you...

75
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:08,861
Do you know how I felt
when I came here to see you?

76
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,331
I believed you wouldn't know.

77
00:04:14,731 --> 00:04:18,030
Not even in my wildest dreams
did I think you'd have deceived me.

78
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:20,130
Whatever others said,

79
00:04:21,571 --> 00:04:24,100
I trusted you.

80
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,141
But...

81
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:31,610
It was all a lie.

82
00:04:34,881 --> 00:04:38,050
I didn't know
you were such a bad person.

83
00:04:40,451 --> 00:04:44,321
I didn't know you were the type
to wrap others around your finger.

84
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,961
Ji Young.

85
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,701
I never deceived you,

86
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,271
and I never lied.

87
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,571
I was just waiting
until your memory returned.

88
00:04:59,571 --> 00:05:00,670
Let's break up.

89
00:05:03,711 --> 00:05:05,811
I can't date someone like you.

90
00:05:06,381 --> 00:05:08,550
- Ji Young.
- Don't say my name!

91
00:05:09,021 --> 00:05:12,321
How could you
when you duped me all this while?

92
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,730
Ji Young. Wait.

93
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:26,670
Hear me out.

94
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,170
I'm so scared of you right now.

95
00:05:32,511 --> 00:05:35,511
I don't even want to
look at your face right now.

96
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,181
Don't follow me.

97
00:06:02,771 --> 00:06:04,600
You... Darn you!

98
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,711
You dirtbag.
You should die in a sewer.

99
00:06:08,941 --> 00:06:11,850
You. Why did you
hide Do Ra in your house?

100
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,110
What were you planning?

101
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,920
I went to your place
so many times while she was there.

102
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,720
How could you not tell me?

103
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,090
How could you stand and watch...

104
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,920
as I fought my own daughter,
you scoundrel?

105
00:06:24,061 --> 00:06:26,061
You should rot for what you did.

106
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:27,790
You're not even human!

107
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:28,900
Say something!

108
00:06:29,761 --> 00:06:31,100
Say something!

109
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,670
After Do Ra died,

110
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,410
I missed her and I cried so much
that my eyes festered.

111
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,581
Do you know how many times...

112
00:06:42,581 --> 00:06:44,811
I went to the seaside
to kill myself?

113
00:06:45,011 --> 00:06:46,081
All this while,

114
00:06:46,211 --> 00:06:48,881
you had her hidden in your house,

115
00:06:49,181 --> 00:06:50,480
and you didn't even tell me!

116
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,321
How could you not tell me?
You scoundrel!

117
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,891
Do you even call yourself
a human being?

118
00:06:55,891 --> 00:06:57,121
Why do you think I did that?

119
00:06:58,691 --> 00:07:00,191
Why did Do Ra die?

120
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,501
Why did Do Ra jump into the sea?

121
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,300
Have you forgotten why?

122
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,100
Do Ra suffered so much
because of you when she lived!

123
00:07:11,941 --> 00:07:14,340
What did you say?

124
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,641
That's why I didn't tell her.

125
00:07:17,811 --> 00:07:19,581
That's why I couldn't tell her!

126
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,420
You...

127
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,121
Listen to me carefully.

128
00:07:32,061 --> 00:07:35,461
If you tell anyone
that Do Ra is Ji Young,

129
00:07:36,131 --> 00:07:37,800
that will be the day we both die.

130
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,230
And if you try to
get back with Do Ra,

131
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,371
I swear I'll kill you myself.

132
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,670
I'll burn your house down.
Do you get that?

133
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,110
You dirtbag. You scumbag.

134
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,011
You jerk.

135
00:08:04,391 --> 00:08:05,461
Goodness.

136
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,100
I think Pil Seung
went to meet Ji Young.

137
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,201
What if he wants to bring her back?

138
00:08:14,331 --> 00:08:15,470
He wouldn't do that.

139
00:08:16,201 --> 00:08:19,211
She wouldn't come back
if she had a working brain.

140
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:23,340
Don't you think you and Mother
were a bit too harsh?

141
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,881
I didn't approve of her
as Pil Seung's girlfriend,

142
00:08:28,181 --> 00:08:31,081
but how could you kick her out?
You should've considered Pil Seung.

143
00:08:32,191 --> 00:08:35,290
Don't say anything
if he wants to bring her back.

144
00:08:36,061 --> 00:08:38,121
Why would you say that?

145
00:08:38,121 --> 00:08:39,760
She left and that's that.

146
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,270
- Pil Seung, you're home.
- Hey.

147
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,340
Hi. I'm going upstairs.

148
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,041
Goodness...

149
00:08:58,211 --> 00:09:00,880
Ji Young had a nasty temper.

150
00:09:01,181 --> 00:09:03,980
I guess she screamed at Pil Seung
and chewed him out...

151
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:06,090
because we kicked her out.

152
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,321
Look at his long face.

153
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:12,260
You shouldn't have kicked out a girl
from the country with nowhere to go.

154
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:15,401
Everyone needs someone
to fall back on.

155
00:09:16,161 --> 00:09:17,531
Do you think Ji Young...

156
00:09:17,531 --> 00:09:19,931
broke up with Pil Seung
out of anger?

157
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,201
Do you think?

158
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:23,870
That would be just great.

159
00:09:25,171 --> 00:09:27,571
Mom and Sun Young,
you two were harsh.

160
00:09:27,941 --> 00:09:30,041
You kicked her out
while Pil Seung was away.

161
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,181
We should be celebrating
his big win,

162
00:09:32,181 --> 00:09:33,281
but look at us now.

163
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,821
Goodness...

164
00:09:40,421 --> 00:09:43,620
I didn't know
that was what Director Ko was like.

165
00:09:44,691 --> 00:09:46,691
How could he...

166
00:09:46,691 --> 00:09:49,701
of all people do this to me?

167
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,140
That's what he was always like.

168
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,671
There's no reason to cry over him.

169
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:03,911
Pil Seung ruined your life
and kept us apart.

170
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,711
We pulled each other's hair out...

171
00:10:05,711 --> 00:10:07,850
not knowing
we were mother and daughter.

172
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,250
And Pil Seung stood
and watched all that...

173
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,890
and didn't say a word.

174
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,260
I heard his family
gave you a hard time too.

175
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,661
My heart breaks to think about
what you went through.

176
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,390
Stay well away from him now.

177
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,500
Do Ra.

178
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,401
Forget all about him,

179
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:31,811
trust me, and live a better life.

180
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,711
Do Ra. I got us some dumplings.

181
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,911
Good.

182
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:50,561
Do you remember these?

183
00:10:52,931 --> 00:10:53,931
No.

184
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,730
I don't remember them,
but they taste good.

185
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:01,401
You loved these dumplings.

186
00:11:02,401 --> 00:11:03,500
I did?

187
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,041
Gosh.

188
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:11,811
Do Ra. I'll make it all up to you.

189
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,980
Don't cry at the table.

190
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,990
She might get indigestion.

191
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:23,890
Do Ra. I used to be
an immature, stupid older brother.

192
00:11:24,061 --> 00:11:26,360
I wasted the money you earned...

193
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,431
and thought it came from nowhere.

194
00:11:28,901 --> 00:11:31,730
But after you died,
I tried to make a living,

195
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,630
and I realized how hard it was.

196
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,041
How did you do
all that hard work on your own?

197
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:40,140
I'm so sorry.

198
00:11:42,211 --> 00:11:44,840
Why are we crying when we are
trying to eat dumplings?

199
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,980
Okay.
I'll be a great brother to you now.

200
00:11:52,151 --> 00:11:54,921
Mom, let's call Do Jun over
and have a party tomorrow.

201
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,120
What? Oh, yes. Let's do that.

202
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,191
Do Jun will come
if he hears we found Do Ra.

203
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:04,661
He should know his sister's alive.

204
00:12:04,801 --> 00:12:07,571
Goodness. We must keep it
from the whole world,

205
00:12:07,571 --> 00:12:09,701
but our family
should know the truth.

206
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,340
Who is Do Jun?

207
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,071
He's your younger brother.

208
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,941
You don't even remember him.

209
00:12:16,941 --> 00:12:18,380
What should we do about that?

210
00:12:18,551 --> 00:12:21,081
Do Jun adored you
and did anything you said.

211
00:12:21,781 --> 00:12:25,220
When you three were young
and I had to go to work,

212
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,691
you carried Do Jun around like a mom.

213
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,461
You even sent him abroad to study.

214
00:12:30,461 --> 00:12:33,331
That's how much you loved him.

215
00:12:33,331 --> 00:12:36,401
Do Jun loved you
more than he did me.

216
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,860
Really?

217
00:12:38,831 --> 00:12:40,870
Why does he live elsewhere?

218
00:12:42,441 --> 00:12:43,901
Oh, that's because...

219
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,041
He mistakenly thought you died
because I gambled away...

220
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:51,340
all your hard-earned money.

221
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,781
He left home
saying he'd cut ties with me.

222
00:12:56,451 --> 00:12:57,781
Did he really?

223
00:13:03,691 --> 00:13:05,760
Be sure everything's ready by 11 a.m.

224
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,630
Thanks.

225
00:13:13,071 --> 00:13:14,100
Why are you back?

226
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:17,571
Here.

227
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:20,911
Mr. Gong.

228
00:13:21,441 --> 00:13:24,441
Isn't it embarrassing to stand here
every day with flowers?

229
00:13:24,811 --> 00:13:26,551
I don't mind feeling embarrassed...

230
00:13:26,651 --> 00:13:28,451
if only you'll take me back.

231
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,921
I'll bring flowers every day
until your anger melts away.

232
00:13:32,451 --> 00:13:35,390
So if you worry about
me embarrassing myself,

233
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:38,661
all you have to do
is stop being angry, okay?

234
00:13:39,661 --> 00:13:40,691
Here.

235
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,061
What am I doing here again?

236
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,630
Have I really lost my mind?

237
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,151
Roll this down.

238
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,880
Open the window.

239
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,090
This is driving me crazy.

240
00:14:39,551 --> 00:14:40,791
It's that lady again.

241
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,961
Hello, ma'am.

242
00:14:46,561 --> 00:14:47,831
What now?

243
00:14:47,831 --> 00:14:49,831
Are you here to meet the tenant lady?

244
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,630
- No, I'm not.
- I know you are.

245
00:14:53,331 --> 00:14:55,701
You should stop coming here now.

246
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,441
She already moved out.

247
00:14:57,441 --> 00:14:58,600
She doesn't live here anymore.

248
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:02,240
So go home and tell your mom
to never show up here again.

249
00:15:02,311 --> 00:15:04,340
She moved out? Where?

250
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,151
How would I know that?

251
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,051
It's not like
I should know everything.

252
00:15:08,821 --> 00:15:12,191
Listen. You should
really pull yourself together.

253
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,921
Why are you being like this
when you have a perfect girlfriend?

254
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,161
Oh, dear.

255
00:15:25,431 --> 00:15:26,630
This is so embarrassing.

256
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,740
Why would she talk to me like that?

257
00:15:30,401 --> 00:15:31,801
How embarrassing.

258
00:15:49,961 --> 00:15:53,161
Dance with me and have some fun

259
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,931
Mom, I'll make a lot of money...

260
00:15:54,931 --> 00:15:56,201
so I can buy you a house...

261
00:15:56,201 --> 00:15:58,360
and buy Do Sik and Do Jun
delicious foods.

262
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,931
So, Mom,
I don't want you to cry anymore.

263
00:16:01,201 --> 00:16:03,240
Thank you, Do Ra.

264
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,041
We'll be fine now.

265
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:07,140
It will be all right.

266
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,240
Your mom,

267
00:16:09,311 --> 00:16:11,240
Do Sik, and Do Jun.

268
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,520
Look after them for me.

269
00:16:17,451 --> 00:16:19,291
Dad.

270
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,020
Dad.

271
00:16:22,661 --> 00:16:25,890
Dad. No.

272
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,531
Don't go, Dad.

273
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:31,301
Dad, please.

274
00:16:31,301 --> 00:16:34,370
Dad... Dad!

275
00:16:35,171 --> 00:16:36,801
My gosh. Do Ra...

276
00:16:36,801 --> 00:16:38,140
Do Ra, what's wrong?

277
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,571
Do Ra, did you have a bad dream?

278
00:16:44,081 --> 00:16:45,281
Ms. Baek.

279
00:16:47,411 --> 00:16:50,051
I guess you really are my mom.

280
00:16:50,951 --> 00:16:52,421
Yes, Do Ra.

281
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,321
I'm your mom.

282
00:16:54,321 --> 00:16:56,921
I told you I was your mom.

283
00:16:58,161 --> 00:16:59,931
Mom.

284
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,100
Mom.

285
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:06,401
- Mom.
- My dear Do Ra.

286
00:17:06,831 --> 00:17:09,701
All right, Do Ra.

287
00:17:13,141 --> 00:17:15,510
Do Ra,
did you get your memories back?

288
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,040
Do you recognize us?

289
00:17:18,951 --> 00:17:20,111
No.

290
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,550
I'm not sure
if it was a dream or my memory.

291
00:17:25,381 --> 00:17:27,320
I passed an audition...

292
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,220
and said I'd buy you a house.

293
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,931
And my dad,
who was covered in blood,

294
00:17:34,691 --> 00:17:36,931
asked me to look after my mom...

295
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:40,330
and the family
before he passed away.

296
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,800
Did it really happen?

297
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,770
Yes.

298
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,411
Your dad had a car accident,

299
00:17:50,411 --> 00:17:52,451
so he passed away
in the emergency room.

300
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,980
That's right.

301
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:57,651
Your dad loved you
and cared for you a lot, Do Ra.

302
00:17:57,651 --> 00:18:00,520
My goodness. Do Ra.

303
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,050
My dear Do Ra.

304
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,060
Oh, dear.

305
00:18:05,931 --> 00:18:08,631
All right. My dear Do Ra.

306
00:18:10,101 --> 00:18:11,161
There, there.

307
00:18:25,711 --> 00:18:26,851
Yes.

308
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,181
Next weekend?

309
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:32,550
I will reserve a place
and get back to you then.

310
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:34,951
Okay. Goodbye.

311
00:18:36,591 --> 00:18:38,560
Was that Tae Hee's family?

312
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,490
Do they want to have a meeting
between the families as planned?

313
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,800
Yes. Chairman Gong.

314
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,770
I just got a call about the meeting
for Jin Dan's wedding.

315
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,070
Where should we have the meeting?

316
00:18:48,431 --> 00:18:49,701
Tae Hee seemed...

317
00:18:49,701 --> 00:18:52,411
very disappointed
with Jin Dan that day.

318
00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:53,970
Do they still want to meet us?

319
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:58,341
I don't think
Tae Hee told her parents...

320
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,750
about how Jin Dan got into a fight
over a girl that day.

321
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,951
Thank goodness.

322
00:19:03,951 --> 00:19:06,290
Tae Hee is really considerate.

323
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:08,520
Jin Dan said he went to apologize...

324
00:19:08,921 --> 00:19:11,760
to Tae Hee with some flowers
every day.

325
00:19:11,921 --> 00:19:15,830
I guess she was moved
and decided to have him back.

326
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:21,101
Are you sure Jin Dan ended things
with the lady...

327
00:19:21,101 --> 00:19:22,770
renting a room in Pil Seung's house?

328
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,101
Of course.

329
00:19:24,101 --> 00:19:27,070
He felt bad for the country girl
and tried to help her.

330
00:19:27,171 --> 00:19:30,040
He's kind-hearted,
so he fell for her a little.

331
00:19:30,381 --> 00:19:33,381
But nothing happened
between these two.

332
00:19:33,411 --> 00:19:36,080
He promised me
that it wouldn't happen again.

333
00:19:36,621 --> 00:19:37,881
Anyway, that's great.

334
00:19:38,921 --> 00:19:43,191
A generous woman like her
deserves to be our daughter-in-law.

335
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,591
This is why I like Tae Hee.

336
00:19:45,591 --> 00:19:48,730
I think Tae Hee likes Jin Dan a lot.

337
00:19:50,361 --> 00:19:51,931
What about the Flower Hotel?

338
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,470
They have a good Chinese restaurant.

339
00:19:54,631 --> 00:19:55,941
The food tastes clean too.

340
00:19:55,941 --> 00:19:57,770
Okay. That sounds nice.

341
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:00,411
I'll have the secretaries
make a reservation.

342
00:20:01,371 --> 00:20:03,141
I'm going to work, then.

343
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,580
- Okay. See you.
- I'll see you later.

344
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,711
Okay.

345
00:20:05,711 --> 00:20:07,611
Have a nice day, Chairman Gong.

346
00:20:09,881 --> 00:20:13,220
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

347
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,421
Where did that jerk,
Ko Pil Seung, hide Kim Ji Young?

348
00:20:18,191 --> 00:20:19,461
Should I look into it again?

349
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,661
No, Jin Dan.

350
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,530
Why do you even care about them?

351
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,111
(Queen Mother)

352
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,740
Yes, Mom.

353
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,050
What? Tae Hee's family did?

354
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,750
I made a reservation...

355
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,720
at the Flower Hotel
for next Saturday.

356
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,621
Okay.

357
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,091
Tae Hee didn't say anything.

358
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,191
That's how considerate she is.

359
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,830
I was deeply impressed
by what she did.

360
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,260
After going through all that,

361
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,871
she still wants to marry you
without telling her family about it.

362
00:21:00,871 --> 00:21:02,800
Isn't she really nice?

363
00:21:02,871 --> 00:21:05,141
Yes, I think she is.

364
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,740
Yes!

365
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,951
You're the best.

366
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,310
- Hang on. Watch me.
- Okay.

367
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,621
Yes, Do Sik. It's me.

368
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,800
What does that mean?

369
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,171
Who did you find?

370
00:21:38,141 --> 00:21:39,871
What are you talking about?

371
00:21:47,151 --> 00:21:49,010
Okay. I'll be right there.

372
00:21:55,191 --> 00:21:56,961
Do Jun, what's wrong?

373
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,560
Did something happen?
Or are you feeling sick?

374
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:04,560
Well... Ma Ri,
something urgent has come up.

375
00:22:04,861 --> 00:22:07,131
I'm sorry, but I should go home.

376
00:22:07,901 --> 00:22:09,300
Okay.

377
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,240
Let's go. I'll take you home.

378
00:22:11,871 --> 00:22:13,010
All right.

379
00:22:15,327 --> 00:22:20,008
(Provides grounds that A and B
are mother and daughter.)

380
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,680
So...

381
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,251
why is her face different...

382
00:22:31,251 --> 00:22:33,021
when she's our Do Ra?

383
00:22:34,551 --> 00:22:37,690
When Do Ra fell into the sea,

384
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,491
an old lady from the countryside
tried to save her,

385
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,961
and she had to go through
major reconstructive surgery.

386
00:22:43,961 --> 00:22:45,501
That's why she looks different.

387
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:47,830
She doesn't look the same,

388
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,900
but we should be glad
she is alive and well.

389
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,211
If it hadn't been for that old lady,
we would've never seen Do Ra again.

390
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,781
I have nothing but gratitude for her.

391
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,281
She saved Do Ra's life.

392
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,150
But...

393
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,721
is she really Do Ra?

394
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:12,330
Yes, she is. She's your big sister.

395
00:23:13,261 --> 00:23:15,731
I'm sorry I don't remember you.

396
00:23:17,201 --> 00:23:19,231
I don't know
if this is a memory or not,

397
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:22,301
but I've seen visions of myself
giving a little boy piggyback rides.

398
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:27,311
You used to give me
piggyback rides all the time.

399
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,610
I knew something was off
when I first saw her...

400
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:35,920
at the broadcasting station.

401
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,920
I even saw her
in my dream that night.

402
00:23:38,721 --> 00:23:40,390
Did that really happen?

403
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,231
Again, I'm sorry...

404
00:23:47,061 --> 00:23:48,491
for not remembering you.

405
00:23:50,261 --> 00:23:53,670
I'm your big sister,
but I don't even recognize you.

406
00:23:55,271 --> 00:23:58,640
I still feel awkward around
Ms. Baek and Do Sik.

407
00:23:59,211 --> 00:24:01,610
I know myself as Kim Ji Young,

408
00:24:01,711 --> 00:24:03,880
and I still find it odd...

409
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,551
that you call me Do Ra and such.

410
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,620
I have no idea what's happening.

411
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,590
I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

412
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:18,221
It's all right, so please don't cry.

413
00:24:18,221 --> 00:24:19,430
There's no need to apologize.

414
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,830
It's okay that you don't remember.

415
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:24,400
Of course, everything is unfamiliar
to you including your name.

416
00:24:25,061 --> 00:24:27,201
You don't have to call me your mom.

417
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:28,471
We're...

418
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:31,900
just grateful
you came back to us like this.

419
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,481
You don't have to refer to me
as your brother.

420
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,241
You don't have to remember me.

421
00:24:38,241 --> 00:24:41,251
If it makes you uncomfortable,
I'll call you Ji Young.

422
00:24:41,311 --> 00:24:44,920
So just be by our side.

423
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:50,190
That's right.
I'll also call you Ji Young.

424
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:53,930
Let's take it slow
one step at a time, Do Ra...

425
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,801
I mean, Ji Young.

426
00:24:58,031 --> 00:25:00,130
- Sister.
- Goodness.

427
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:04,340
Thank you so much.

428
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:07,571
Thank you.

429
00:25:07,811 --> 00:25:11,110
And I'm so sorry.

430
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:24,920
Is that true?

431
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:27,291
Ms. Kim moved out?

432
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:31,531
That's great news.
Didn't Pil Seung throw a fit?

433
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,071
Of course, he did.

434
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,971
He yelled at us for kicking her out
while he was away.

435
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:42,610
But they must've argued over it
or something...

436
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:45,741
because he hasn't been eating with us
or making eye contact.

437
00:25:46,981 --> 00:25:48,580
It's upsetting, to say the least.

438
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,321
I hope this will cause them
to break up.

439
00:25:52,721 --> 00:25:55,920
What good does her moving out do?
They'll still be working together.

440
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,791
Aren't you the producer though?

441
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:02,600
How was she cast for the role
when the producer was against it?

442
00:26:02,701 --> 00:26:05,130
The writer
is head over heels for her...

443
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,731
and insisted we cast her.

444
00:26:07,501 --> 00:26:10,771
Filming hasn't begun yet,
so we'll wait and see.

445
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,791
The last time was too sudden...

446
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:34,190
and you were worked up,

447
00:26:35,231 --> 00:26:37,061
so I couldn't say
all I wanted to say.

448
00:26:39,971 --> 00:26:41,130
Go ahead, then.

449
00:26:45,801 --> 00:26:46,910
After you fainted...

450
00:26:47,971 --> 00:26:49,281
at the hotel,

451
00:26:50,711 --> 00:26:53,051
you said a nightmare of some sort
haunted your memories.

452
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,880
You didn't want
to regain your memories...

453
00:26:56,821 --> 00:26:59,021
and were too scared
to go back to your old life.

454
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:00,751
Do you remember saying that?

455
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:03,961
I do.

456
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,190
When you were Do Ra,

457
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,900
you must've been in great pain...

458
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,231
to choose death over life.

459
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,971
You must've been desperate
to have made that choice.

460
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:22,910
You were shivering in fear
in my arms,

461
00:27:26,251 --> 00:27:28,251
and that tore my heart into pieces.

462
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,350
Why would you tell me that?

463
00:27:31,781 --> 00:27:32,821
Ji Young.

464
00:27:34,051 --> 00:27:36,160
Back in the day, Do Ra told me...

465
00:27:37,461 --> 00:27:39,791
that her mother only saw her
as a money-making machine...

466
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,001
and that her mother
made her life miserable.

467
00:27:44,531 --> 00:27:45,660
Do Ra wanted to die because of it.

468
00:27:47,231 --> 00:27:48,571
That's why I didn't tell you...

469
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,440
or Ms. Baek that you were Do Ra.

470
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,880
Ji Young.

471
00:27:58,981 --> 00:28:00,551
If I'm put
in the same situation again,

472
00:28:01,751 --> 00:28:03,180
I'll make the same choice.

473
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,251
Even now,
I wish you to live as Kim Ji Young.

474
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:10,961
The second people find out
you're Park Do Ra,

475
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,491
I know what'll happen to you.

476
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:17,061
I don't want you to be in agony.

477
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,971
You don't have to see me again.

478
00:28:22,471 --> 00:28:23,670
I don't care...

479
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:26,771
if you travel somewhere far away.

480
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,110
Ji Young,

481
00:28:31,981 --> 00:28:33,481
go to a place
where people don't know you...

482
00:28:34,811 --> 00:28:36,150
and live as Kim Ji Young.

483
00:28:37,951 --> 00:28:39,551
Stay away from Ms. Baek.

484
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:41,890
Please.

485
00:28:46,031 --> 00:28:48,491
Ms. Baek is my mother
who gave birth to me.

486
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:52,900
So how dare you speak ill of her...

487
00:28:53,301 --> 00:28:55,130
in front of me?

488
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:57,870
But on top of that,

489
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,870
you're even telling me
to abandon her.

490
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,140
Let me ask you this, then.

491
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:07,481
Director Ko.

492
00:29:08,481 --> 00:29:10,281
Can you abandon your own mother?

493
00:29:17,061 --> 00:29:18,090
I...

494
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,491
will never forgive you, Director Ko.

495
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:24,400
So don't call me out
if it's to say things like that.

496
00:29:26,201 --> 00:29:27,400
It's over for us.

497
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:37,180
When you gain all your memories,

498
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,080
you will know...

499
00:29:41,711 --> 00:29:42,850
how sincere I was.

500
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,521
I don't know what you mean by that,

501
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:50,890
but I can't understand...

502
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,660
how you want me
to abandon my own parent.

503
00:29:53,961 --> 00:29:55,491
I'll never forgive you for that.

504
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,840
Sitting around the table like this
and eating together...

505
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,610
makes us seem like a family again.

506
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:49,311
Tell me about it.

507
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:58,890
What is it?
Doesn't it suit your palate?

508
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:03,731
Here. Try this.

509
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,231
You used to love braised tofu.

510
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,511
It's delicious.

511
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:25,850
What's wrong, Ji Young?
Did something happen?

512
00:31:26,521 --> 00:31:29,890
Ji Young, tell me what's wrong.
I'll deal with it.

513
00:31:33,961 --> 00:31:35,031
I...

514
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:40,071
broke up with Director Ko.

515
00:31:41,001 --> 00:31:43,541
Really? Good for you.

516
00:31:43,541 --> 00:31:46,071
I'm glad you ended it. He's no good.

517
00:31:46,311 --> 00:31:47,610
I can only help but think...

518
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:49,471
there was bad blood between us
starting from our previous lives.

519
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:57,380
Did you turn down the role
that was given to you?

520
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,180
You can't work together
after breaking up with him.

521
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:03,291
Don't be ridiculous.
Why would she quit?

522
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,120
She should end things
with Ko Pil Seung...

523
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,291
but still star in the role
she was offered.

524
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:08,360
Come on.

525
00:32:08,961 --> 00:32:11,801
Ji Young, your professional career
is another story.

526
00:32:11,961 --> 00:32:14,531
Not everyone gets to join
a project like that.

527
00:32:14,531 --> 00:32:15,771
Who would cast you...

528
00:32:15,771 --> 00:32:18,071
when you're an inexperienced
rookie actress?

529
00:32:18,801 --> 00:32:20,241
So work on the project...

530
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,840
but squash
any personal feelings you have.

531
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:25,610
What are you talking about, Mom?

532
00:32:25,741 --> 00:32:27,011
Ji Young shouldn't have
an acting career.

533
00:32:27,711 --> 00:32:30,221
What if other people
find out she's Do Ra?

534
00:32:30,551 --> 00:32:33,150
They'll chew her out
for rebuilding her acting career...

535
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,951
after faking her death. Seriously...

536
00:32:35,751 --> 00:32:36,761
What?

537
00:32:37,991 --> 00:32:41,890
It must be because I have no recollection
of the bad things...

538
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:44,231
that happened to me
when I was Park Do Ra,

539
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,971
but I've been living as Kim Ji Young.

540
00:32:47,971 --> 00:32:49,840
I only know myself as Kim Ji Young.

541
00:32:50,471 --> 00:32:51,771
To be honest,

542
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,140
I'm confused to be suddenly told
I'm Park Do Ra,

543
00:32:55,271 --> 00:32:57,311
and I can't even believe it.

544
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,281
But I can't stay hidden
because of that...

545
00:33:01,281 --> 00:33:02,880
not doing anything.

546
00:33:03,951 --> 00:33:07,751
I want to live my life
doing what I want.

547
00:33:08,221 --> 00:33:11,620
There you go.
You're Park Do Ra for sure.

548
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,360
Also, I want to work hard...

549
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,830
and help you two out.

550
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:18,531
Look at us.

551
00:33:18,531 --> 00:33:21,271
The whole family
isn't able to live together.

552
00:33:22,731 --> 00:33:26,100
I'm going to work hard,
earn a lot of money,

553
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:29,011
and move to a bigger
and better place.

554
00:33:29,011 --> 00:33:31,241
We'll bring Do Jun back...

555
00:33:32,041 --> 00:33:34,650
and repay my grandma
for all she has done.

556
00:33:35,511 --> 00:33:38,650
To do so, I need to make it
as a successful actor.

557
00:33:40,791 --> 00:33:42,690
Just hearing you say that
brings tears to my eyes.

558
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:45,890
There's the daughter I raised.

559
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:51,001
Still, I don't think it's wise
for you to go into acting again.

560
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:54,600
Ji Young, why don't you
think this through?

561
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,370
That hurts. Mom, what...

562
00:33:57,471 --> 00:33:59,571
Since I don't remember who I was...

563
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:02,440
and can't speak up for myself
regarding my past scandal,

564
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:05,041
I can't tell people who I really am.

565
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,650
Once I regain my memories...

566
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,920
and am able to explain my situation,

567
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,221
there will come a day...

568
00:34:13,221 --> 00:34:15,521
for me to tell people who I am.

569
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,360
That's right. Goodness, Do Ra.

570
00:34:22,491 --> 00:34:24,130
I'm going to work hard.

571
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,900
My dad told me in my sleep...

572
00:34:27,371 --> 00:34:30,371
to take care of
Mom, Do Sik, and Do Jun.

573
00:34:31,571 --> 00:34:35,040
I promised our dad.

574
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,081
I told him not to worry.

575
00:34:37,741 --> 00:34:39,440
- Do Ra...
- Do Ra...

576
00:34:50,261 --> 00:34:51,460
Director Ko.

577
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:58,161
I heard from Ji Young
that you two...

578
00:34:58,161 --> 00:34:59,531
broke up.

579
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,101
That's how it should be.

580
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:03,641
Finally, everything is
how it should be.

581
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,940
I just hope that you won't
hold it against her...

582
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:10,210
and cut her from the new series
you're about to direct.

583
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,181
Ji Young was offered the role
after auditioning for the part.

584
00:35:16,951 --> 00:35:19,790
Why would I drop her
when she did nothing wrong?

585
00:35:20,391 --> 00:35:23,290
That won't happen, so don't worry.

586
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,761
Right, Director Ko?

587
00:35:24,761 --> 00:35:27,560
Got it. I'll take your word for it
and get going.

588
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,560
Thanks.

589
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,661
Just a second.

590
00:35:31,031 --> 00:35:33,130
- What?
- Since you're here,

591
00:35:33,971 --> 00:35:35,201
I'd like to say something.

592
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,641
Say what?

593
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,340
Before Do Ra died,

594
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:41,471
she told me this.

595
00:35:42,471 --> 00:35:44,310
That you brought her misery.

596
00:35:45,011 --> 00:35:47,110
She wanted to die numerous times
because of you.

597
00:35:47,511 --> 00:35:50,980
She lived as a money-making machine
doing things she didn't want to do.

598
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,951
She was in a lot of pain.

599
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,351
That's why...

600
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,991
I wanted Do Ra to live as Ji Young.

601
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:00,161
I didn't want her...

602
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,630
to remember the heartache.

603
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,860
What are you yapping about?

604
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,130
Since she miraculously
made it back to you,

605
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:11,900
don't put her through that again.

606
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:15,170
Don't abuse her and turn her into...

607
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,411
your personal bank.

608
00:36:18,581 --> 00:36:20,551
What? I abused her?

609
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:24,121
Now you've crossed the line.

610
00:36:24,821 --> 00:36:26,951
You unexpectedly lost her once,

611
00:36:28,221 --> 00:36:29,821
so let her be happy.

612
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:32,721
Don't make her cry again...

613
00:36:33,931 --> 00:36:35,891
and embrace her
like the mother you should be.

614
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:40,670
I'm not a stepmother
who abuses her stepchild.

615
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,371
I'm her biological mother.

616
00:36:42,371 --> 00:36:46,201
Who in this world
cares more for her than I do?

617
00:36:49,141 --> 00:36:50,880
I only let her go
because she wanted to leave.

618
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,710
If not, I would've kept her
by my side.

619
00:36:54,681 --> 00:36:56,210
But I will keep my eyes on you...

620
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:59,551
and see how you treat her.

621
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:05,161
How dare he say
he'd keep an eye on me?

622
00:37:05,161 --> 00:37:07,931
Who does he think he is? Her mother?

623
00:37:07,931 --> 00:37:09,491
You crossed the line once again.

624
00:37:09,491 --> 00:37:11,360
Unbelievable.

625
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,301
It's terrifying though.

626
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:15,201
That punk.

627
00:37:15,571 --> 00:37:18,440
Goodness. I'm lost for words.

628
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:34,520
That's right.

629
00:37:34,991 --> 00:37:37,621
It's a miracle
that Do Ra came back to us,

630
00:37:38,491 --> 00:37:41,161
and I won't make
the same mistake again.

631
00:37:41,931 --> 00:37:44,761
I'll have her be
the A-list celebrity she was...

632
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,270
and live...

633
00:37:48,101 --> 00:37:49,500
a better life.

634
00:38:05,192 --> 00:38:06,422
Really?

635
00:38:06,893 --> 00:38:08,922
The DNA test proved that Ji Young...

636
00:38:08,922 --> 00:38:10,692
is in fact Do Ra?

637
00:38:10,692 --> 00:38:11,732
Someone might hear you!

638
00:38:13,632 --> 00:38:15,562
No wonder.

639
00:38:15,562 --> 00:38:17,303
I always had an odd feeling
about Ji Young.

640
00:38:17,303 --> 00:38:19,832
That was because she was Do Ra!

641
00:38:20,473 --> 00:38:23,442
I may have lost everything I had
after Do Ra died,

642
00:38:23,603 --> 00:38:25,743
but you know
how I relied on you like a son.

643
00:38:25,812 --> 00:38:26,913
Of course.

644
00:38:27,312 --> 00:38:29,343
That is why I'm suggesting...

645
00:38:29,382 --> 00:38:31,882
joint ownership of the agency.

646
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:34,123
I'm Do Ra's...

647
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:38,623
I'm Ji Young's mom
so how can I sit back and do nothing?

648
00:38:38,792 --> 00:38:40,323
Right, of course.

649
00:38:40,962 --> 00:38:43,823
I knew it. We've always been family.

650
00:38:43,823 --> 00:38:44,832
So let's do this.

651
00:38:44,832 --> 00:38:48,132
We'll share the profit 50-50.
What do you say?

652
00:38:48,763 --> 00:38:51,132
Right. I'm on board, Ms. Baek.

653
00:38:55,442 --> 00:38:56,603
Jae Dong, like before...

654
00:38:56,603 --> 00:39:00,343
No, I'll work even harder
than I used to.

655
00:39:01,082 --> 00:39:02,683
Let's make Ji Young...

656
00:39:02,683 --> 00:39:05,513
into an A-list actor again.

657
00:39:05,513 --> 00:39:06,513
Sure.

658
00:39:06,712 --> 00:39:08,082
Just know...

659
00:39:08,082 --> 00:39:10,993
that you must watch what you say.

660
00:39:10,993 --> 00:39:12,422
Of course.

661
00:39:12,422 --> 00:39:14,962
People can't find out, Do Ra...

662
00:39:14,962 --> 00:39:18,163
I'll take the secret
to my grave, Ms. Baek.

663
00:39:18,163 --> 00:39:20,433
Right? Jae Dong, my gosh!

664
00:39:21,332 --> 00:39:24,533
Thank you so much. Thank you, Do Ra.

665
00:39:31,042 --> 00:39:32,143
Good morning.

666
00:39:38,553 --> 00:39:39,953
Unbelievable.

667
00:39:40,953 --> 00:39:43,553
Do I have to constantly
see him like this?

668
00:39:45,623 --> 00:39:47,922
Why did Soo Yeon
have to work out of this building?

669
00:39:48,422 --> 00:39:50,163
Now I'm off to a crappy morning.

670
00:39:57,263 --> 00:39:58,272
Hold on.

671
00:39:58,772 --> 00:40:00,033
It's Kim Ji Young.

672
00:40:17,283 --> 00:40:18,292
What?

673
00:40:18,853 --> 00:40:20,593
What is Kim Ji Young doing
at GOGO Entertainment?

674
00:40:22,263 --> 00:40:24,332
Did Ko Pil Seung bring her here?

675
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:27,362
Are you kidding me?

676
00:40:27,763 --> 00:40:29,533
(Kim Ji Young,
Popcorn Entertainment)

677
00:40:29,533 --> 00:40:32,402
(Cast for "The House of Roses")

678
00:40:32,533 --> 00:40:35,143
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

679
00:40:35,143 --> 00:40:36,243
Ko Pil Seung.

680
00:40:36,942 --> 00:40:38,073
Hold on.

681
00:40:38,643 --> 00:40:40,712
Did he get her a job here?

682
00:40:43,612 --> 00:40:45,752
What is that jerk,
Ko Pil Seung, up to?

683
00:40:46,612 --> 00:40:47,853
This is unbelievable.

684
00:40:48,723 --> 00:40:50,783
I'm Cha Bong Soo
who was cast as Cha Gil Soo...

685
00:40:50,783 --> 00:40:52,093
in "The House of Roses."

686
00:40:56,462 --> 00:40:58,993
I'm Kim Na Bi who was cast
as Kim Soo Young...

687
00:40:58,993 --> 00:41:00,232
in "The House of Roses."

688
00:41:06,772 --> 00:41:07,803
Right.

689
00:41:09,502 --> 00:41:12,212
I'm Kim Ji Young
who was cast as Lee Yeon Doo...

690
00:41:12,542 --> 00:41:13,712
in "The House of Roses."

691
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:15,913
I hope we get along.

692
00:41:18,982 --> 00:41:20,882
I'm Park Jin Soo
who will be playing Kang Jin Sang.

693
00:41:25,922 --> 00:41:28,422
We did a great job casting
the right people for the roles.

694
00:41:28,792 --> 00:41:30,593
Just looking at you all
brings a smile to my face,

695
00:41:30,593 --> 00:41:33,493
and I have a feeling
our series will be a huge hit.

696
00:41:34,663 --> 00:41:36,462
All that's left is for me to perform.

697
00:41:36,462 --> 00:41:37,632
I hope we all get along.

698
00:41:40,332 --> 00:41:41,902
We have an amazing script,

699
00:41:42,343 --> 00:41:44,643
and we cast some incredible actors.

700
00:41:45,112 --> 00:41:46,343
I'm excited too.

701
00:41:46,542 --> 00:41:49,542
I'll do my best
so we get great results.

702
00:42:00,522 --> 00:42:01,522
Hey.

703
00:42:02,493 --> 00:42:04,732
I was on my way to your office.

704
00:42:05,393 --> 00:42:07,462
- We happened to meet.
- What's this about?

705
00:42:07,462 --> 00:42:09,933
You know Angel Investment invested
in GOGO Entertainment, right?

706
00:42:10,033 --> 00:42:11,573
I'm a shareholder.

707
00:42:11,803 --> 00:42:12,832
So what?

708
00:42:12,832 --> 00:42:15,203
Kim Ji Young. I want her out.

709
00:42:18,073 --> 00:42:19,112
What?

710
00:42:19,112 --> 00:42:21,082
You acted like
you kept work and life separate,

711
00:42:21,643 --> 00:42:23,513
but you gave your girlfriend a role.

712
00:42:24,513 --> 00:42:26,013
Is this where you come to date?

713
00:42:27,152 --> 00:42:29,123
Do you think I invested
to boost your love life?

714
00:42:33,323 --> 00:42:34,922
I heard you got an award
from overseas.

715
00:42:35,993 --> 00:42:38,933
That means you have
an extra responsibility to society.

716
00:42:40,632 --> 00:42:41,962
What if people were to hear...

717
00:42:41,962 --> 00:42:43,832
you lost all sense
and cast your girlfriend?

718
00:42:44,832 --> 00:42:46,103
That could become a huge issue.

719
00:42:47,172 --> 00:42:50,442
Before things get worse,
drop Ji Young from the project.

720
00:42:51,513 --> 00:42:54,812
She got the role
through an impartial interview.

721
00:42:56,183 --> 00:42:57,882
And even if you're an investor,

722
00:42:59,082 --> 00:43:00,882
casting is within
the director's purview.

723
00:43:02,053 --> 00:43:03,123
Goodbye.

724
00:43:08,562 --> 00:43:11,292
My gosh. That arrogant punk.

725
00:43:12,362 --> 00:43:13,962
Has he lost his mind?

726
00:43:14,862 --> 00:43:18,502
He's a nobody with nothing.
What gives him so much guts?

727
00:43:24,203 --> 00:43:25,243
Soo Yeon.

728
00:43:25,513 --> 00:43:28,843
Jin Dan. What's this about
that you'd come in without knocking?

729
00:43:28,843 --> 00:43:31,783
Ko Pil Seung
and Kim Ji Young are dating.

730
00:43:32,053 --> 00:43:33,053
You know that.

731
00:43:34,252 --> 00:43:36,853
This is GOGO Entertainment's
first project,

732
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:39,292
and this is how you cast people?

733
00:43:40,623 --> 00:43:41,723
Kim Ji Young...

734
00:43:41,723 --> 00:43:44,223
is a total rookie who was in
just one one-episode drama.

735
00:43:44,962 --> 00:43:47,292
Do you think it makes sense
for a director...

736
00:43:48,132 --> 00:43:50,002
to cast someone like that
for personal reasons...

737
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,933
in a 30-million-dollar project?

738
00:43:53,402 --> 00:43:56,172
I won't say more.
I want Kim Ji Young replaced.

739
00:43:56,973 --> 00:43:58,413
By someone better known.

740
00:43:59,542 --> 00:44:01,343
Wouldn't that
make the drama watchable?

741
00:44:02,183 --> 00:44:03,212
Jin Dan.

742
00:44:05,112 --> 00:44:07,823
You might have
invested in my company,

743
00:44:07,823 --> 00:44:10,422
but you're overstepping
your authority.

744
00:44:10,783 --> 00:44:13,453
Who we cast is up to us.

745
00:44:13,453 --> 00:44:16,062
I think I have a right to say this,
as an investor.

746
00:44:16,962 --> 00:44:18,163
If you don't replace Kim Ji Young,

747
00:44:19,033 --> 00:44:20,192
I'll withdraw my investment.

748
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:24,062
This will become a problem
down the line.

749
00:44:25,703 --> 00:44:27,632
I went as far as to warn you,

750
00:44:27,772 --> 00:44:30,143
so I trust you'll make
the right decision.

751
00:44:30,772 --> 00:44:31,973
Goodbye.

752
00:44:43,382 --> 00:44:44,752
Hello, Ms. Jang.

753
00:44:45,093 --> 00:44:46,223
Director Ko.

754
00:44:47,323 --> 00:44:48,562
This won't do.

755
00:44:49,223 --> 00:44:51,062
We need to
replace Ji Young with someone.

756
00:44:53,332 --> 00:44:56,163
Ms. Jang.
We dealt with that issue already.

757
00:44:57,203 --> 00:44:59,732
The problems we are worried about
are surfacing already.

758
00:45:00,933 --> 00:45:04,103
The investor found out
about you and Kim Ji Young...

759
00:45:04,513 --> 00:45:05,873
so he wants to withdraw
the investment.

760
00:45:06,612 --> 00:45:09,542
We say we cast her impartially
without any emotions involved,

761
00:45:09,542 --> 00:45:11,283
but others don't see it that way.

762
00:45:12,482 --> 00:45:15,683
It is a fact
that you two are dating.

763
00:45:16,522 --> 00:45:19,152
People will say
you decided to cast Ji Young...

764
00:45:19,152 --> 00:45:20,292
and held an audition for show,

765
00:45:20,453 --> 00:45:23,462
and if that becomes a problem
and it turns into negative gossip,

766
00:45:23,862 --> 00:45:26,632
it will hurt our company's image.

767
00:45:26,862 --> 00:45:28,203
So replace Ji Young with...

768
00:45:28,203 --> 00:45:30,362
Ji Young and I are broken up.

769
00:45:32,232 --> 00:45:35,203
What? Is that true?

770
00:45:35,873 --> 00:45:38,973
Yes, so you don't have to
worry about that.

771
00:45:39,413 --> 00:45:41,343
There won't be any negative gossip.

772
00:45:47,252 --> 00:45:50,152
Gosh. They broke up?

773
00:45:52,953 --> 00:45:54,893
Is that true, Soo Yeon?

774
00:45:55,922 --> 00:45:59,462
Pil Seung really said they broke up?

775
00:46:01,632 --> 00:46:03,933
Okay, thanks. Bye.

776
00:46:04,832 --> 00:46:09,172
Hey. Pil Seung and our ex-tenant
broke up?

777
00:46:09,772 --> 00:46:10,873
Yes.

778
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:13,573
Some people voiced concern...

779
00:46:13,573 --> 00:46:15,413
about the fact
that they were a couple.

780
00:46:15,683 --> 00:46:17,882
Since it could become a problem.

781
00:46:18,652 --> 00:46:22,183
But Pil Seung said there would be
no problem because they'd broken up.

782
00:46:23,553 --> 00:46:26,853
Do you think they're pretending
to have broken up...

783
00:46:26,853 --> 00:46:28,522
because of the casting issue?

784
00:46:28,993 --> 00:46:30,393
Mother.

785
00:46:30,723 --> 00:46:34,062
Pil Seung isn't the type
to scheme like that.

786
00:46:34,732 --> 00:46:35,763
He's not.

787
00:46:35,962 --> 00:46:38,232
It all worked out.

788
00:46:39,002 --> 00:46:41,243
I feel like I had
a rotten tooth pulled.

789
00:46:42,002 --> 00:46:45,143
Sun Young. You owe me for that.

790
00:46:46,143 --> 00:46:48,942
Yes, but Mother.

791
00:46:49,843 --> 00:46:53,482
I don't feel too good about it.

792
00:46:53,712 --> 00:46:56,152
Don't you think we went too far?

793
00:46:56,823 --> 00:46:58,022
What?

794
00:46:58,553 --> 00:46:59,953
Would she have...

795
00:46:59,953 --> 00:47:01,993
broken up with Pil Seung
if we hadn't done that?

796
00:47:02,663 --> 00:47:06,332
Things would have been much worse
if she hadn't left when she did.

797
00:47:06,692 --> 00:47:09,362
That CEO Mr. Gong,
your friend's son.

798
00:47:09,533 --> 00:47:11,103
He came back.

799
00:47:11,632 --> 00:47:13,573
- Did he really?
- Yes.

800
00:47:13,573 --> 00:47:15,873
I told him
that Ji Young had moved out,

801
00:47:15,873 --> 00:47:19,143
so he should never come back
to look for her.

802
00:47:19,942 --> 00:47:21,343
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

803
00:47:21,982 --> 00:47:23,683
Pil Seung and Ji Young...

804
00:47:24,442 --> 00:47:26,453
could've broken up
because of Mr. Gong.

805
00:47:27,252 --> 00:47:29,482
It can't be that.

806
00:47:30,882 --> 00:47:32,323
You never know.

807
00:47:33,192 --> 00:47:35,223
Wait and see. I'm right.

808
00:47:44,573 --> 00:47:46,272
- I'm home.
- Soo Yeon.

809
00:47:47,433 --> 00:47:49,103
Kim Ji Young's casting problem.

810
00:47:49,803 --> 00:47:51,473
Did you talk to Director Ko
and the scriptwriter?

811
00:47:54,143 --> 00:47:57,482
Were you waiting for me
to ask me that?

812
00:47:59,683 --> 00:48:02,283
Soo Yeon. Do you know...

813
00:48:03,353 --> 00:48:05,393
you're extra forgiving
when it comes to...

814
00:48:05,393 --> 00:48:07,223
matters with Director Ko?

815
00:48:08,462 --> 00:48:09,922
What?

816
00:48:10,192 --> 00:48:12,862
Just because he's your friend's son,

817
00:48:12,933 --> 00:48:14,663
you pay him a fortune
and offer support.

818
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:18,272
And he casts an actress
with zero experience...

819
00:48:18,502 --> 00:48:21,473
in a huge project
because she's his girlfriend.

820
00:48:22,573 --> 00:48:25,843
You run the company
with your heart and not your head.

821
00:48:26,212 --> 00:48:29,013
That's why Director Ko
doesn't care what he does.

822
00:48:29,013 --> 00:48:31,953
Director Ko and Ji Young broke up.

823
00:48:31,953 --> 00:48:33,752
They're not an item anymore.

824
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,953
So what you're saying
isn't based on truth.

825
00:48:38,623 --> 00:48:40,652
Is that true?

826
00:48:55,442 --> 00:48:57,243
Oh, my gosh.

827
00:49:25,373 --> 00:49:26,402
Oh, gosh.

828
00:49:58,902 --> 00:50:01,973
What do you have to say
that's so important?

829
00:50:03,843 --> 00:50:07,212
You left something behind
as you moved in a hurry.

830
00:50:07,812 --> 00:50:08,843
What?

831
00:50:09,683 --> 00:50:10,913
What's that?

832
00:50:14,382 --> 00:50:15,422
A cutting board.

833
00:50:16,323 --> 00:50:17,353
What?

834
00:50:17,953 --> 00:50:21,962
This is the important thing
you wanted to talk about?

835
00:50:26,163 --> 00:50:28,603
I was nervous thinking I'd made...

836
00:50:28,603 --> 00:50:30,362
a huge mistake
in the read-through...

837
00:50:30,362 --> 00:50:32,103
or that I'd analyzed...

838
00:50:32,103 --> 00:50:33,873
the character all wrong.

839
00:50:33,873 --> 00:50:36,143
Did you come all the way here
to give me that board?

840
00:50:36,272 --> 00:50:37,672
It's not just a board.

841
00:50:38,442 --> 00:50:40,772
Do you care that little
about your possessions?

842
00:50:41,373 --> 00:50:43,843
This played such a huge part
whenever you cooked.

843
00:50:44,882 --> 00:50:47,312
It would feel so hurt to know
you called it "just a board."

844
00:50:48,123 --> 00:50:50,823
It's quite hefty and sturdy.

845
00:50:51,453 --> 00:50:53,393
It could've been made by an artisan.

846
00:50:54,522 --> 00:50:55,663
It's possible...

847
00:50:56,593 --> 00:50:58,493
it was a valued possession,

848
00:50:59,393 --> 00:51:02,232
and you were staying up at night
thinking of it.

849
00:51:03,632 --> 00:51:05,803
I gave it a lot of thought
before bringing it over.

850
00:51:05,803 --> 00:51:09,973
Director. I bought it at some store
for three dollars.

851
00:51:10,272 --> 00:51:13,013
If you like it that much,
you can have it.

852
00:51:13,573 --> 00:51:14,573
Wait.

853
00:51:17,812 --> 00:51:18,812
Ji Young.

854
00:51:19,812 --> 00:51:21,522
Even if someone says...

855
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:23,553
something negative
about how you got cast,

856
00:51:24,683 --> 00:51:25,823
don't mind it.

857
00:51:26,522 --> 00:51:28,053
You auditioned...

858
00:51:28,323 --> 00:51:29,922
and you won fair and square.

859
00:51:31,123 --> 00:51:32,362
Don't feel intimidated.

860
00:51:33,062 --> 00:51:34,292
Have confidence.

861
00:51:36,002 --> 00:51:37,502
Director Ko...

862
00:51:39,772 --> 00:51:41,373
Actually, this board was
just an excuse.

863
00:51:42,172 --> 00:51:43,442
I came here to say this.

864
00:51:52,712 --> 00:51:54,283
Thank you, Director Ko.

865
00:51:55,353 --> 00:51:58,893
I'll work hard
so I won't cause you any trouble.

866
00:52:00,853 --> 00:52:02,323
Go home safe then.

867
00:52:03,962 --> 00:52:05,663
Ji Young, let me just say
one more thing.

868
00:52:08,562 --> 00:52:09,803
I will always be...

869
00:52:10,562 --> 00:52:11,973
waiting for you.

870
00:52:13,002 --> 00:52:14,533
Don't forget...

871
00:52:15,373 --> 00:52:16,473
that I'm here for you.

872
00:52:21,982 --> 00:52:24,812
I'm going to pretend
I didn't hear that.

873
00:52:38,962 --> 00:52:41,933
Here's why I called you over.

874
00:52:42,502 --> 00:52:45,573
Our drama will begin filming
next week,

875
00:52:45,632 --> 00:52:47,832
but since you're a rookie,

876
00:52:47,832 --> 00:52:49,272
many people...

877
00:52:49,272 --> 00:52:51,812
including our CEO are
quite concerned about it.

878
00:52:51,812 --> 00:52:54,643
So I asked you to come
to practice reading.

879
00:52:55,482 --> 00:52:56,843
I see, Ms. Kim.

880
00:52:56,942 --> 00:52:59,513
All right then. Let's begin
with Scene 7 of Episode 1.

881
00:53:00,853 --> 00:53:03,623
Hello, everyone.

882
00:53:03,623 --> 00:53:05,093
My goodness.

883
00:53:05,093 --> 00:53:07,353
Excuse me, Director Ko.

884
00:53:08,462 --> 00:53:09,723
Ms. Kim.

885
00:53:09,723 --> 00:53:12,132
I'm CEO Baek Mi Ja
of Baek Entertainment...

886
00:53:12,132 --> 00:53:13,362
which Ji Young belongs to.

887
00:53:14,362 --> 00:53:17,502
I'm a big fan of yours, Ms. Kim.

888
00:53:17,502 --> 00:53:19,973
Your new work is
really interesting too.

889
00:53:19,973 --> 00:53:22,143
Please take good care
of our Ji Young.

890
00:53:22,743 --> 00:53:24,402
- All right then.
- Wait.

891
00:53:24,402 --> 00:53:25,442
Yes?

892
00:53:27,042 --> 00:53:30,582
Weren't you the CEO
of Park Do Ra's agency?

893
00:53:34,612 --> 00:53:37,382
You are Park Do Ra's mother, right?

894
00:53:39,053 --> 00:53:41,763
- How do you know me?
- My goodness.

895
00:53:41,862 --> 00:53:43,792
When Actress Park Do Ra passed away,

896
00:53:43,792 --> 00:53:46,292
I was deeply heartbroken.

897
00:53:46,632 --> 00:53:49,132
Ms. Baek, please hang in there.

898
00:53:49,132 --> 00:53:51,002
I hope you'll be successful.

899
00:53:51,362 --> 00:53:53,803
Thank you so much, Ms. Kim.

900
00:53:53,803 --> 00:53:55,203
Even though...

901
00:53:55,203 --> 00:53:57,143
my Do Ra isn't in this world,

902
00:53:57,143 --> 00:53:59,143
I'll be sure...

903
00:53:59,143 --> 00:54:01,643
to make Kim Ji Young
the next Park Do Ra.

904
00:54:01,643 --> 00:54:04,082
Please take good care of her.

905
00:54:04,082 --> 00:54:05,252
All right then.

906
00:54:05,252 --> 00:54:07,982
Ji Young, please call me
when you're finished.

907
00:54:07,982 --> 00:54:10,022
Excuse me. I'm sorry, Director Ko.

908
00:54:10,022 --> 00:54:12,453
Try your best, Ji Young. Thank you.

909
00:54:19,062 --> 00:54:21,033
All right. Let's begin.

910
00:54:26,132 --> 00:54:28,203
My heart races
whenever I talk about Do Ra.

911
00:54:28,442 --> 00:54:29,703
It's crazy that I will have to...

912
00:54:29,703 --> 00:54:31,272
live like this
for the rest of my life.

913
00:54:34,672 --> 00:54:36,942
Oh, right. This is APP Group.

914
00:54:36,942 --> 00:54:39,882
That's why CEO Gong Jin Dan is here.

915
00:54:39,953 --> 00:54:42,323
My gosh. I forgot about that.

916
00:54:47,652 --> 00:54:50,522
No one should know
that Do Ra is alive,

917
00:54:50,522 --> 00:54:53,232
and especially not that jerk,
Gong Jin Dan.

918
00:54:53,232 --> 00:54:56,002
You should be careful, Baek Mi Ja.

919
00:54:59,603 --> 00:55:02,873
Ji Young did quite well
during the audition.

920
00:55:02,873 --> 00:55:03,942
What's wrong with her?

921
00:55:04,942 --> 00:55:06,373
I just don't understand.

922
00:55:06,712 --> 00:55:08,272
What should we do
if she keeps being like this?

923
00:55:09,783 --> 00:55:11,882
We picked her
because she nailed the audition.

924
00:55:11,882 --> 00:55:14,683
I'll make sure
to bring out her talent again.

925
00:55:14,683 --> 00:55:16,022
Please don't worry about it.

926
00:55:17,223 --> 00:55:20,493
Okay.
I'm counting on you, Director Ko.

927
00:55:21,123 --> 00:55:22,163
Sure.

928
00:55:43,212 --> 00:55:44,942
I'm sorry, Director Ko.

929
00:55:45,413 --> 00:55:47,612
I was really bad today, right?

930
00:55:47,712 --> 00:55:50,953
I got really nervous
and messed it up.

931
00:55:52,192 --> 00:55:54,393
You're a rookie,
so it's natural that you're nervous.

932
00:55:55,022 --> 00:55:56,062
It's okay.

933
00:55:56,723 --> 00:55:59,163
But the shoot isn't far off.

934
00:55:59,292 --> 00:56:02,703
What if I don't do things well?
I feel so hopeless.

935
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:05,402
Ji Young.

936
00:56:06,332 --> 00:56:09,303
We picked you because we knew
you could do this.

937
00:56:09,973 --> 00:56:11,243
Don't worry about it.

938
00:56:12,343 --> 00:56:14,873
Do you really mean that?

939
00:56:14,873 --> 00:56:17,542
Of course. You can pull this off.

940
00:56:18,413 --> 00:56:19,982
I believe in you.

941
00:56:21,982 --> 00:56:24,623
Just tell me
if you have any difficulties.

942
00:56:25,192 --> 00:56:28,192
And don't forget
that I'm always here for you...

943
00:56:29,123 --> 00:56:32,192
and that I'm waiting for you.

944
00:56:41,573 --> 00:56:42,643
Director Ko.

945
00:56:43,902 --> 00:56:47,442
Please just treat me
as one of the actors you work with.

946
00:56:48,683 --> 00:56:52,382
I can't work with you
when you're so sweet to me.

947
00:56:53,482 --> 00:56:54,712
I'd like you to say...

948
00:56:54,712 --> 00:56:57,482
only things
that you need to say for work.

949
00:57:03,263 --> 00:57:04,993
Thank you for today, Director Ko.

950
00:57:05,862 --> 00:57:07,993
I should get going then.

951
00:57:11,502 --> 00:57:12,832
Goodbye.

952
00:57:13,672 --> 00:57:14,732
Director Ko.

953
00:57:26,853 --> 00:57:28,283
(Ms. Jang: Director Ko,
can you spare some time today?)

954
00:57:34,053 --> 00:57:35,893
Director Ko, over here.

955
00:57:38,123 --> 00:57:39,232
Have a seat.

956
00:57:43,462 --> 00:57:45,172
This is Director Ko Pil Seung.

957
00:57:45,272 --> 00:57:46,303
I know.

958
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:49,343
He's the director
who won the Juniper Award, right?

959
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:53,172
It is an honor to meet you.

960
00:57:53,672 --> 00:57:55,382
Yes. Hello.

961
00:57:55,843 --> 00:57:59,053
This is Dr. Choi Min A,
the daughter of Director Choi...

962
00:57:59,053 --> 00:58:00,283
of Choi Hospital.

963
00:58:02,022 --> 00:58:04,123
I really liked your drama,
"Don't Lie."

964
00:58:05,922 --> 00:58:07,522
I'm glad you liked it. Thank you.

965
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:13,562
This is bad.
I was going to eat with you,

966
00:58:13,562 --> 00:58:16,402
but I should go back to the office
and sign some documents.

967
00:58:16,862 --> 00:58:18,402
You two should have lunch together.

968
00:58:18,402 --> 00:58:19,933
I ordered the food.

969
00:58:20,272 --> 00:58:23,672
You two are of the same age,
so you should feel comfortable...

970
00:58:23,672 --> 00:58:25,672
around each other like friends.

971
00:58:25,672 --> 00:58:26,913
Bye, Min A.

972
00:58:41,792 --> 00:58:43,422
Is everything going well for them?

973
00:58:47,093 --> 00:58:49,862
Director Ko, you're back early.

974
00:58:51,663 --> 00:58:52,703
Ms. Jang.

975
00:58:53,433 --> 00:58:56,272
Did you call me out
to set me up with her?

976
00:58:57,002 --> 00:59:00,042
Min A is
a dear acquaintance of mine.

977
00:59:00,042 --> 00:59:01,743
I've known her since she was little.

978
00:59:01,743 --> 00:59:03,812
I thought
you two would make a cute couple.

979
00:59:05,112 --> 00:59:07,853
Ms. Jang,
I find this quite uncomfortable.

980
00:59:08,413 --> 00:59:09,882
Please don't do that again.

981
00:59:11,453 --> 00:59:13,792
Well... Pil Seung,

982
00:59:13,792 --> 00:59:17,223
I mean, Director Ko,
I've seen you since you were little,

983
00:59:17,792 --> 00:59:19,232
so I feel like you're my son,

984
00:59:19,232 --> 00:59:21,792
and I wanted
to find you someone nice.

985
00:59:24,033 --> 00:59:26,573
I'm grateful that
you think of me like a son,

986
00:59:27,502 --> 00:59:29,303
but I don't want this
to happen again.

987
00:59:29,803 --> 00:59:32,413
I'm not interested
in dating right now.

988
00:59:39,913 --> 00:59:42,752
Maybe he isn't
over Kim Ji Young yet.

989
00:59:46,323 --> 00:59:47,953
I was being too hasty.

990
00:59:50,663 --> 00:59:52,163
- He's good, right?
- Yes.

991
00:59:53,393 --> 00:59:54,393
What?

992
00:59:54,832 --> 00:59:56,862
- Pil Seung, you're home.
- Hey.

993
00:59:56,933 --> 00:59:58,002
Did you have dinner?

994
00:59:59,033 --> 01:00:00,732
Did you ask Ms. Jang...

995
01:00:01,232 --> 01:00:02,973
to set me up with a woman?

996
01:00:03,703 --> 01:00:06,172
How could you do such a thing
without asking me?

997
01:00:06,973 --> 01:00:10,112
What are you talking about?
What woman?

998
01:00:11,082 --> 01:00:12,652
I didn't know.

999
01:00:13,513 --> 01:00:15,683
Then did Ms. Jang do such a thing
on her own?

1000
01:00:16,223 --> 01:00:17,853
Even without asking you?

1001
01:00:18,152 --> 01:00:21,022
What? Did you ask her
to set Pil Seung up with a woman?

1002
01:00:21,022 --> 01:00:23,862
No, I didn't know any of that.

1003
01:00:24,792 --> 01:00:27,962
Did Soo Yeon really set you up
with a woman?

1004
01:00:27,962 --> 01:00:29,433
Mom, I'm begging you.

1005
01:00:30,062 --> 01:00:31,933
Please stop trying things like that.

1006
01:00:33,203 --> 01:00:35,103
Well... Hey.

1007
01:00:38,243 --> 01:00:41,873
Sun Young, what was all that about?

1008
01:00:42,843 --> 01:00:44,312
Are you sure it wasn't you?

1009
01:00:44,312 --> 01:00:46,683
No. I didn't do it, Mother.

1010
01:00:48,382 --> 01:00:50,053
You know Choi Hospital.

1011
01:00:50,053 --> 01:00:51,823
She's Director Choi's only daughter.

1012
01:00:51,823 --> 01:00:53,192
She's a doctor,

1013
01:00:53,192 --> 01:00:55,663
and she's nice and good-natured.

1014
01:00:56,093 --> 01:00:58,093
But, Soo Yeon,

1015
01:00:58,093 --> 01:01:00,362
why did you not tell me?

1016
01:01:00,933 --> 01:01:03,603
Pil Seung took it out on me
as soon as he got home.

1017
01:01:03,603 --> 01:01:05,473
I was really startled.

1018
01:01:06,132 --> 01:01:08,303
I see. You know,

1019
01:01:08,303 --> 01:01:11,643
I said I'd find Pil Seung
someone nice...

1020
01:01:11,643 --> 01:01:14,343
when we were talking the other day.

1021
01:01:14,442 --> 01:01:15,542
Still,

1022
01:01:15,542 --> 01:01:18,913
you should've told me beforehand.

1023
01:01:18,982 --> 01:01:21,683
You can't just set my son up
with someone...

1024
01:01:21,683 --> 01:01:24,123
without his own mom knowing.

1025
01:01:24,752 --> 01:01:26,223
Well...

1026
01:01:26,223 --> 01:01:29,422
I've seen Pil Seung
since he was a little kid,

1027
01:01:29,422 --> 01:01:30,993
so I feel like he's my son.

1028
01:01:31,362 --> 01:01:32,462
So...

1029
01:01:33,533 --> 01:01:34,562
Soo Yeon.

1030
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:37,263
I understand how you feel.

1031
01:01:37,603 --> 01:01:39,973
But he's my son, not yours.

1032
01:01:41,033 --> 01:01:44,873
Right, of course.
Sun Young, I'm sorry.

1033
01:01:45,002 --> 01:01:49,243
In the future,
I'll have you sign off on it first.

1034
01:01:49,643 --> 01:01:50,643
Sure.

1035
01:01:50,812 --> 01:01:53,812
Anyway, thank you
for going the extra mile.

1036
01:01:56,522 --> 01:01:58,223
What did she say?
Did Soo Yeon set him up...

1037
01:01:58,223 --> 01:01:59,453
on a blind date?

1038
01:02:00,152 --> 01:02:01,223
Yes.

1039
01:02:02,192 --> 01:02:04,093
Without telling you,

1040
01:02:04,292 --> 01:02:06,462
she set Pil Seung up with a girl?

1041
01:02:07,692 --> 01:02:09,962
I'm grateful for how she has...

1042
01:02:09,962 --> 01:02:12,502
always been nice to Pil Seung.

1043
01:02:13,973 --> 01:02:17,473
But she set him up with a girl
without telling you?

1044
01:02:19,513 --> 01:02:21,743
He signed
that generous contract of hers,

1045
01:02:22,143 --> 01:02:24,513
and she's acting like his mother.

1046
01:02:25,243 --> 01:02:27,183
Sun Young, you'd better watch it...

1047
01:02:27,183 --> 01:02:28,853
or she might steal your son away.

1048
01:02:31,152 --> 01:02:32,953
Mother, please.

1049
01:02:36,022 --> 01:02:38,093
I know I'm right.

1050
01:02:40,062 --> 01:02:42,832
What? Pil Seung isn't here.

1051
01:02:44,362 --> 01:02:46,672
Ma Ri, what brings you by?

1052
01:02:47,232 --> 01:02:49,172
I wanted to bring
Pil Seung some flowers.

1053
01:02:49,502 --> 01:02:50,502
Aren't they pretty?

1054
01:02:50,502 --> 01:02:52,973
Seriously?
But you didn't bring me any.

1055
01:02:53,712 --> 01:02:55,112
I'll bring you some next time.

1056
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:57,683
Anyway, where did he go?

1057
01:02:57,683 --> 01:02:59,982
He went to check the set today.

1058
01:02:59,982 --> 01:03:00,982
The set?

1059
01:03:00,982 --> 01:03:03,982
Isn't that where
the drama series is filmed?

1060
01:03:03,982 --> 01:03:05,053
Yes.

1061
01:03:05,053 --> 01:03:07,593
Mom, can we go there?
I'm dead curious.

1062
01:03:07,593 --> 01:03:09,422
I've really wanted to go to one.

1063
01:03:10,593 --> 01:03:11,593
Why not?

1064
01:03:42,893 --> 01:03:44,223
Mom, it's Pil Seung.

1065
01:03:46,593 --> 01:03:47,962
- Wait.
- Oh, no.

1066
01:03:49,332 --> 01:03:51,033
Pil Seung, no!

1067
01:03:51,533 --> 01:03:52,533
Duck.

1068
01:03:54,103 --> 01:03:56,873
- Mom!
- Are you okay?

1069
01:03:56,873 --> 01:03:59,442
Help. Please help them!

1070
01:03:59,442 --> 01:04:01,473
Mom, are you all right?

1071
01:04:01,473 --> 01:04:04,343
- Are you all right? Call 119.
- Somebody help!

1072
01:04:04,343 --> 01:04:06,513
- Somebody help!
- Director, are you all right?

1073
01:04:06,513 --> 01:04:08,353
- Mom!
- What happened?

1074
01:04:08,353 --> 01:04:09,953
Mom, no.

1075
01:04:09,953 --> 01:04:12,022
- Somebody help!
- Director!

1076
01:04:12,493 --> 01:04:14,493
- Pil Seung.
- Ko Pil Seung!

1077
01:04:14,493 --> 01:04:16,123
My gosh. Pil Seung!

1078
01:04:16,393 --> 01:04:18,593
- Pil Seung.
- Pil Seung...

1079
01:04:18,593 --> 01:04:19,663
Are you all right?

1080
01:04:19,933 --> 01:04:21,292
What happened?

1081
01:04:21,832 --> 01:04:24,062
I'm all right, but Ms. Jang...

1082
01:04:24,303 --> 01:04:25,303
What?

1083
01:04:26,172 --> 01:04:28,132
My gosh, Soo Yeon.

1084
01:04:28,672 --> 01:04:31,143
Soo Yeon? Please wake up.

1085
01:04:32,442 --> 01:04:34,243
Ma Ri, what happened?

1086
01:04:35,712 --> 01:04:38,513
A wall came down
while we were on set.

1087
01:04:38,843 --> 01:04:41,953
She saved Pil Seung
and ended up this way.

1088
01:04:42,683 --> 01:04:45,692
My mom won't wake up
no matter how hard I shake her.

1089
01:04:45,723 --> 01:04:48,123
What? She saved Pil Seung?

1090
01:04:48,553 --> 01:04:50,763
No...

1091
01:04:51,393 --> 01:04:53,033
Not my Pil Seung.

1092
01:04:53,093 --> 01:04:54,393
Pil Seung!

1093
01:05:06,643 --> 01:05:09,542
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1094
01:05:41,747 --> 01:05:43,258
Park Do Ra didn't have a sponsor.

1095
01:05:43,258 --> 01:05:44,758
As if.

1096
01:05:44,758 --> 01:05:47,127
You can still
read the articles online.

1097
01:05:47,158 --> 01:05:48,428
Did you say 50,000 dollars?

1098
01:05:48,428 --> 01:05:51,298
I won't settle
until I get 50,000 dollars.

1099
01:05:51,298 --> 01:05:52,667
I'll take legal action!

1100
01:05:52,667 --> 01:05:54,767
If you agree to it,

1101
01:05:54,767 --> 01:05:56,897
there's a job
that'll get you 30,000 dollars.

1102
01:05:56,897 --> 01:05:59,238
Then I should do it right away.

1103
01:05:59,238 --> 01:06:00,437
I'm afraid there's an issue.

1104
01:06:00,437 --> 01:06:03,107
I don't think we'll be able
to work with Ms. Kim.

1105
01:06:03,107 --> 01:06:05,138
Ji Young might be dropped from
the project because of Ms. Baek.

1106
01:06:05,138 --> 01:06:06,778
They're going to revoke her contract.

1107
01:06:06,778 --> 01:06:09,147
Have you already forgotten
about the pain...

1108
01:06:09,147 --> 01:06:10,448
you inflicted on Do Ra?

1109
01:06:10,448 --> 01:06:11,747
And you call yourself her mother?

1110
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:14,187
