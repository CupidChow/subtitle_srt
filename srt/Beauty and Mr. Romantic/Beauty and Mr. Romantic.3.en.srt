(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:09,646 --> 00:00:11,345
(Episode 3)

3
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,031
I wired the money,

4
00:00:18,031 --> 00:00:20,630
so I doubt those people
will bother you anymore.

5
00:00:20,961 --> 00:00:24,000
That's right. You saved us four, sir.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,930
You're our savior.

7
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,640
I'm glad and happy for you.

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,200
By the way,

9
00:00:30,741 --> 00:00:33,610
don't lose the transfer form,
and keep it safe.

10
00:00:34,011 --> 00:00:37,381
It'll be fine since the bankbook
has the record of the transaction,

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,011
but you never know.

12
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,620
This is a large sum of money,

13
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,521
and I don't know how I can repay you.

14
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,021
I'll... I'll work hard...

15
00:00:51,021 --> 00:00:53,330
so that I can pay back
all the money someday.

16
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,161
Sure. Do so when you're in
a better situation.

17
00:00:56,631 --> 00:00:59,231
Gosh, thank you so much.

18
00:00:59,231 --> 00:01:02,101
I'll help you financially
for the time being,

19
00:01:02,101 --> 00:01:03,540
so don't worry too much.

20
00:01:04,201 --> 00:01:06,140
Instead, quit the work
you're doing at night...

21
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,381
and find something you can do
during the day.

22
00:01:08,381 --> 00:01:10,381
That will be better for the children.

23
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,780
Sir...

24
00:01:14,051 --> 00:01:16,351
I'm too ashamed and grateful...

25
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:18,521
to even look you in the eye.

26
00:01:18,521 --> 00:01:20,191
Mr. Kim!

27
00:01:21,221 --> 00:01:22,590
Mr. Kim.

28
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,661
It's all right.

29
00:01:32,471 --> 00:01:33,530
What?

30
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:34,670
Isn't that Sun Young's father?

31
00:01:35,271 --> 00:01:37,771
Wait. Who's that woman?

32
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:43,111
Sir, can you please stop the bus?

33
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:44,381
I can't.

34
00:01:44,381 --> 00:01:46,111
You can get off at the next stop.

35
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,251
Unbelievable. We drove past them.

36
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,491
Hold on a second. What...

37
00:01:54,891 --> 00:01:56,191
What on earth did I see?

38
00:01:57,521 --> 00:01:58,691
Has Sun Young's father...

39
00:02:00,831 --> 00:02:03,900
been seeing someone?

40
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:09,471
Sun Young.

41
00:02:10,001 --> 00:02:11,040
What?

42
00:02:11,141 --> 00:02:13,641
Sun Young!

43
00:02:14,211 --> 00:02:16,481
Mom, what is it? Is something up?

44
00:02:16,481 --> 00:02:18,451
Myung Dong, where's your sister-in-law?

45
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:20,750
She left saying she had plans.

46
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,921
Hold on.

47
00:02:22,581 --> 00:02:24,321
Where on earth...

48
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,321
- The phone is turned off.
- Why is her phone turned off...

49
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:30,120
at this crucial moment?

50
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,430
Mom, what on earth is going on?

51
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,600
Well, I just saw Sun Young's father...

52
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,301
on the street...

53
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:39,930
with a younger woman in his arms.

54
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,671
Sun Young's father with a younger woman?

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,671
Don't be ridiculous.

56
00:02:45,141 --> 00:02:47,370
Seriously.

57
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,840
I didn't manage to catch her face,

58
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,380
but judging by her physique
and her clothes,

59
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,620
it didn't seem like a woman
around his age.

60
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,880
She was obviously way younger than him.

61
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,391
Gosh, the embarrassment!

62
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,120
Myung Dong, hold on.

63
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,361
Could a gold digger...

64
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,361
have gotten her claws in him?

65
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,660
A gold digger?

66
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:13,530
Mom, please don't say something so nasty.

67
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,940
Think about it.
Why would a younger woman...

68
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,741
be huddled up in his arms
if she wasn't a gold digger?

69
00:03:18,741 --> 00:03:20,440
It wasn't some friendly hug.

70
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,611
Anyone could tell it was highly romantic.

71
00:03:22,611 --> 00:03:24,680
Her head was in the nook of his neck.

72
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,551
Are you serious?

73
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,250
That's what I've been saying.

74
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,250
Anyway, where is Sun Young...

75
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,921
and why can't I reach her?

76
00:03:33,921 --> 00:03:37,590
What are we going to do about this?

77
00:03:37,891 --> 00:03:39,761
- This is insane.
- The phone is turned off.

78
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,600
- Unbelievable.
- Please leave a message after the tone.

79
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,331
This is bad.

80
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,530
What are we going to do?

81
00:03:47,571 --> 00:03:50,671
So tell me. Did Ae Kyo
move into the master bedroom...

82
00:03:50,671 --> 00:03:51,711
at Soo Yeon's place?

83
00:03:51,711 --> 00:03:54,541
That's right.
Ae Kyo called me to brag about it...

84
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:55,981
as if that's something to be proud of.

85
00:03:55,981 --> 00:03:58,081
Soo Yeon must be bubbling with anger...

86
00:03:58,081 --> 00:04:00,111
without anyone to vent this out on.

87
00:04:00,211 --> 00:04:02,180
How clueless can Ae Kyo be?

88
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,850
How does it make sense...

89
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:07,650
for a high school friend
to be one's mother-in-law?

90
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,660
Hold that thought. Ae Kyo's here.

91
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,930
Girls.

92
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,201
Did something happen on your way here?

93
00:04:18,201 --> 00:04:19,331
What's wrong?

94
00:04:19,671 --> 00:04:20,930
That's not it.

95
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,600
I'm sure you know Ji Hye,
a good friend of Sun Young's.

96
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,610
Yes, she married an American...

97
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,480
and moved to the US. What about her?

98
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,410
I ran into her
at the department store today.

99
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:32,150
She stopped by the place...

100
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,081
before leaving for the airport
with her husband.

101
00:04:34,081 --> 00:04:36,480
We were happy to see each other
which had us catching up for a bit.

102
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,451
She asked about Sun Young,

103
00:04:38,521 --> 00:04:41,050
so I said Sun Young was doing fine
after giving birth to her son.

104
00:04:41,121 --> 00:04:42,860
Completely startled, she blurted this out.

105
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,490
"That's odd."

106
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,391
"Sun Young's infertile."

107
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,800
Hold on. Sun Young was infertile?

108
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,371
That's right.
Due to an enlarged uterine fibroid,

109
00:04:52,371 --> 00:04:53,771
she had to get a hysterectomy.

110
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:56,340
Ji Hye was like,
"How could have she given birth..."

111
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,371
"when she doesn't have a uterus?"

112
00:04:57,371 --> 00:04:59,211
Come to think of it,

113
00:04:59,211 --> 00:05:01,271
I never heard
about Sun Young being pregnant.

114
00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:04,081
It's why I found it odd
when I suddenly heard she had a son.

115
00:05:04,141 --> 00:05:06,951
If you think about it,
her son doesn't look like her...

116
00:05:06,951 --> 00:05:08,780
or her husband.

117
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,451
I was wondering who he took after.

118
00:05:10,451 --> 00:05:11,720
My gosh.

119
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,821
You're right. He's the only one
with curly hair in that family.

120
00:05:14,821 --> 00:05:16,920
Sun Young and her husband
both have straight hair.

121
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,990
Goodness.

122
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:20,191
Her son must be a foundling.

123
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,631
I wonder where she found him.

124
00:05:23,331 --> 00:05:25,300
What on earth are you saying?

125
00:05:31,941 --> 00:05:33,610
How could you?

126
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,141
And you call yourself my friends?

127
00:05:36,941 --> 00:05:38,480
Sun Young, wait.

128
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:41,110
When Sun Young had her baby,

129
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,821
since her mother had already passed away,

130
00:05:42,821 --> 00:05:44,121
I went with her to the hospital...

131
00:05:44,121 --> 00:05:46,021
and helped her recover.

132
00:05:46,021 --> 00:05:47,951
So what kind of nonsense are you spewing?

133
00:05:50,191 --> 00:05:51,261
What...

134
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,001
Put yourself in her shoes.

135
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:01,300
How would you feel if people
accused your child of being a foundling?

136
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,910
How can you call yourself her friends
when you have the audacity...

137
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,811
to gossip about her behind her back?

138
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,211
I'm disappointed in all of you.

139
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,251
- Goodness.
- Whatever.

140
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,790
Sun Young, don't be upset.

141
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,561
They won't ever gossip
about your son again.

142
00:06:30,061 --> 00:06:32,501
Dae Chung knows the truth now,

143
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:35,371
so who cares what others say?

144
00:06:41,011 --> 00:06:43,081
But it's still upsetting...

145
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:46,681
to hear my friends
say those things about me.

146
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,451
Dae Chung...

147
00:06:55,061 --> 00:06:57,160
is your son whom you gave birth to.

148
00:06:58,691 --> 00:07:00,790
He's the son you raised with love.

149
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,371
Thanks, Soo Yeon.

150
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:10,371
If it weren't for you,

151
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,011
I would've completely lost my mind.

152
00:07:15,441 --> 00:07:18,350
There's no need to thank me.
That's absurd.

153
00:07:23,751 --> 00:07:25,990
I must've been a war hero
in my previous life...

154
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,090
to have gotten a friend like you.

155
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,660
I'm truly grateful.

156
00:07:35,201 --> 00:07:36,701
Thank you so much.

157
00:07:37,961 --> 00:07:40,501
Come on. You're embarrassing me.

158
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,840
By the way,

159
00:07:46,271 --> 00:07:49,240
is Dae Chung handling
the revelation better?

160
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:52,110
Yes.

161
00:07:52,951 --> 00:07:54,181
He's doing better now.

162
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,350
I can't tell what he's truly thinking,

163
00:07:58,251 --> 00:08:00,521
but he's been studying even harder...

164
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,360
ever since he found out.

165
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,790
The family hasn't made a big deal
out of it either.

166
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,761
Really?

167
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,931
That's a huge relief.

168
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:25,181
Soo Yeon said she was there
when Sun Young gave birth.

169
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:28,110
Why did Ji Hye
have to share such nonsense?

170
00:08:28,621 --> 00:08:31,181
I ended up looking bad.

171
00:08:32,191 --> 00:08:34,191
I should've gotten Ji Hye's number.

172
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,660
I'm so angry.

173
00:08:36,121 --> 00:08:37,121
My gosh.

174
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:41,161
You act so elegant away from home
but you never knock.

175
00:08:41,161 --> 00:08:42,860
Do you call yourself a mom?

176
00:08:43,301 --> 00:08:46,801
How could you talk about
someone's kid when you know nothing?

177
00:08:47,171 --> 00:08:49,441
Would you like it if someone said
Jin Dan wasn't your son?

178
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,201
Did I say that?

179
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,171
Why would you bring my son into it?

180
00:08:53,941 --> 00:08:56,041
I heard about it from Ji Hye,

181
00:08:56,211 --> 00:08:59,451
and I was so shocked
that I mentioned it to the other girls.

182
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,951
What's so wrong about that?

183
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,750
You told me off once already.
You don't have to start over.

184
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:08,090
If you think the world of your kid,
others think the same of theirs.

185
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,890
You should think harder.

186
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:11,890
What did you say?

187
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:15,461
I'm your mother-in-law now.

188
00:09:15,661 --> 00:09:17,500
How dare you talk like that to me?

189
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,901
- Then act like an adult.
- Is that all you can say?

190
00:09:20,431 --> 00:09:21,840
How could you do this to me?

191
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,571
Do you look down on me
because I'm a mistress?

192
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,140
You can keep this up,
but I won't put up with it.

193
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,480
My goodness. You what?

194
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,951
Did you just laugh?

195
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,711
Am I laughingstock?

196
00:09:34,711 --> 00:09:36,051
Am I?

197
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,451
What's with all the shouting?

198
00:09:39,451 --> 00:09:40,490
What's the matter?

199
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,520
Honey.

200
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:49,230
I can't live with her under the same roof.

201
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,931
I tried to put up with it
for your sake and to honor...

202
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,671
Father's dying wish.

203
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,270
But I've had enough.

204
00:09:58,811 --> 00:10:01,071
My gosh. How dare she?

205
00:10:01,811 --> 00:10:03,081
She's not in the right.

206
00:10:03,911 --> 00:10:05,811
She never addressed me as "Mother,"

207
00:10:05,811 --> 00:10:07,451
or treated me like a mother-in-law.

208
00:10:08,581 --> 00:10:10,551
Jin Taek. I mean, Chairman Gong.

209
00:10:11,151 --> 00:10:13,850
I'm really upset and I feel wronged.

210
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,061
If you care about your late father,

211
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,890
put your wife in her place.

212
00:10:19,831 --> 00:10:21,860
How much longer must I live like this?

213
00:10:23,661 --> 00:10:25,201
I'll find you a place to stay.

214
00:10:26,071 --> 00:10:27,531
I think you should move out.

215
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,000
What?

216
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,840
What did you just say, Chairman Gong?

217
00:10:33,711 --> 00:10:35,010
You want me to leave?

218
00:10:35,211 --> 00:10:36,941
Out of respect for my father's dying will,

219
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,980
and out of respect
for the woman who had his child,

220
00:10:40,311 --> 00:10:43,350
I barely persuaded my wife
to let you live with us.

221
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,990
But she said she had enough.

222
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,921
What other choice do I have?

223
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,461
Jin Taek. Chairman Gong.

224
00:10:52,061 --> 00:10:55,360
Oh, no. What do I do now?

225
00:10:56,901 --> 00:10:58,000
Oh, dear.

226
00:10:59,031 --> 00:11:02,000
Darn you. You stupid thing. You birdbrain.

227
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,240
Good for you.

228
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,000
What's in that brain of yours?

229
00:11:05,441 --> 00:11:07,041
Do you even think?

230
00:11:07,411 --> 00:11:08,640
That hurt!

231
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,411
Can you not annoy me too?

232
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:14,250
Did you have to talk with no filter?

233
00:11:30,531 --> 00:11:33,171
This is blueberry juice.

234
00:11:34,401 --> 00:11:35,901
I made it myself.

235
00:11:36,801 --> 00:11:38,740
It's full of anthocyanin,

236
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:40,840
so it's good for your eyes.

237
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,740
At our age, we need to
take extra care of our eyesight.

238
00:11:45,551 --> 00:11:46,880
You drink it.

239
00:11:47,181 --> 00:11:49,151
Can you get out? I want to rest.

240
00:11:55,161 --> 00:11:57,020
Soo Yeon. I'm sorry.

241
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,031
I thought about it and I was in the wrong.

242
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,760
I was rash.

243
00:12:03,301 --> 00:12:05,701
I'll apologize to Sun Young too.

244
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:09,340
I'll do as you want and live quietly.

245
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,571
Please don't tell me to leave.

246
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:15,340
I can't live away from here.
I'd be too lonely to survive.

247
00:12:15,681 --> 00:12:17,911
You know how lonely I get.

248
00:12:20,411 --> 00:12:21,711
Please, Soo Yeon.

249
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,220
I'll be really good to you from now on.

250
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,720
You don't have to treat me
like a mother-in-law.

251
00:12:27,151 --> 00:12:28,250
So...

252
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,630
please let me stay here
with the family. Will you?

253
00:13:01,651 --> 00:13:04,220
- Hello?
- Dae Chung.

254
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,860
Who...

255
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,531
- Park Do Ra?
- Get over here quick.

256
00:13:08,961 --> 00:13:11,161
The bullies from before are asking me...

257
00:13:11,161 --> 00:13:12,970
- for money again.
- What? Where are you?

258
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,640
(Go! Yuperwings)

259
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,250
I swear this is the place.

260
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,451
Where is she?

261
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,590
Did they drag her off somewhere?

262
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,791
Dae Chung.

263
00:13:41,661 --> 00:13:42,701
Park Do Ra?

264
00:13:46,671 --> 00:13:47,770
Why are you in this state?

265
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:50,340
Oh, this?

266
00:13:51,201 --> 00:13:53,840
I had an audition
and I didn't take off my makeup yet.

267
00:13:54,811 --> 00:13:56,081
How do I look?

268
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,581
What kind of audition was it...

269
00:14:00,581 --> 00:14:02,350
that they dressed a kid like this?

270
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,921
Where are the bullies?

271
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,590
- Where are they?
- Oh, about that.

272
00:14:08,321 --> 00:14:10,821
I said you were on the way
and they ran off.

273
00:14:11,061 --> 00:14:12,061
Did they?

274
00:14:13,331 --> 00:14:14,760
Were you hurt?

275
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,801
Did they hit you?

276
00:14:16,931 --> 00:14:18,301
No. I'm fine.

277
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,730
Good.

278
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,640
Let's go home, then.

279
00:14:23,171 --> 00:14:24,770
Just like that?

280
00:14:25,441 --> 00:14:27,911
Yes. What else can we do here?

281
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,811
You should rush home
and take off the weird makeup.

282
00:14:31,811 --> 00:14:32,951
And change clothes.

283
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,620
People are staring.

284
00:14:37,051 --> 00:14:38,821
We came all the way here.

285
00:14:38,821 --> 00:14:41,291
Let's go on rides
like the pirate ship or carousel.

286
00:14:41,421 --> 00:14:43,321
What? The carousel?

287
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,061
I'm not a kid.

288
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,561
I've never been on a carousel.

289
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,661
It's my first time at an amusement park.

290
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,801
It's your first time at one?

291
00:15:54,191 --> 00:15:55,191
Do Ra...

292
00:16:02,401 --> 00:16:03,401
Oh, no.

293
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,270
Hey.

294
00:16:12,151 --> 00:16:13,681
Why did this drop out of that?

295
00:16:16,921 --> 00:16:17,921
Hey.

296
00:16:18,951 --> 00:16:20,490
What were the socks doing in there?

297
00:16:23,561 --> 00:16:24,590
Don't ask!

298
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,360
My gosh.

299
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,701
What was that even for?

300
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,870
Park Do Ra! Where are you going?

301
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,980
My gosh!

302
00:16:45,781 --> 00:16:46,781
Dae Chung!

303
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,651
(Camera)

304
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,130
Hey, Park Do Ra.

305
00:17:17,141 --> 00:17:19,280
You lied about meeting the bullies,

306
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,080
and about having an audition, didn't you?

307
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:27,990
Why on earth are you doing this to me?

308
00:17:28,651 --> 00:17:31,520
It's like I said. I have feelings for you.

309
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,030
I wanted to be with you
and have fun with you, okay?

310
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,060
What?

311
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,530
So you lied to make me come here?

312
00:17:42,101 --> 00:17:43,601
You put on makeup like an adult,

313
00:17:43,601 --> 00:17:45,240
and wore a short skirt and heels?

314
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,310
And you even stuffed your bra with socks?

315
00:17:48,641 --> 00:17:50,540
Yes. I like you so much...

316
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,411
that I wanted to look older.

317
00:17:52,911 --> 00:17:55,621
You only see me
as the little girl who lives next door.

318
00:17:57,921 --> 00:17:59,250
You're just a pre-teen kid.

319
00:18:00,391 --> 00:18:03,391
Park Do Ra,
don't acknowledge me ever again.

320
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,861
I'll go back to being strangers too.

321
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,631
How dare you?

322
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,201
What makes you think you're so great?

323
00:18:12,901 --> 00:18:14,871
A pre-teen kid
can't even have feelings for you?

324
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,901
You even said...

325
00:18:16,901 --> 00:18:19,211
age didn't matter in love.

326
00:18:24,911 --> 00:18:27,351
It's not a crime
that I have feelings for you.

327
00:18:27,681 --> 00:18:29,250
You told me that...

328
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,151
it isn't a sin to be in love.

329
00:18:38,931 --> 00:18:39,961
Park Do Ra.

330
00:18:40,961 --> 00:18:41,990
Get up.

331
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,701
Stop crying and stand up. Now.

332
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,800
People are watching.

333
00:18:50,401 --> 00:18:51,770
Get up this instant.

334
00:18:52,911 --> 00:18:54,540
Or I'll just leave.

335
00:18:57,911 --> 00:19:00,411
Park Do Ra. Listen to me.

336
00:19:01,851 --> 00:19:04,851
I should be a good son to my parents.

337
00:19:05,181 --> 00:19:06,421
You know why, don't you?

338
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,490
And you told me...

339
00:19:09,861 --> 00:19:11,461
to focus on my studies.

340
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:15,631
So I've made up my mind to study hard.

341
00:19:16,461 --> 00:19:18,361
Do you think
it is a good idea to distract me?

342
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,371
If you really care about me,

343
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,770
you shouldn't be distracting me.

344
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,080
Okay.

345
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,280
But I really like you.
What am I supposed to do?

346
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,651
Do Ra.

347
00:19:35,181 --> 00:19:36,750
I can't afford to like someone...

348
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,951
and hang out with her now.

349
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,290
So we will talk about this again...

350
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,661
when you turn 20.

351
00:19:45,661 --> 00:19:46,790
Are you sure?

352
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:49,230
Yes. So let's just go.

353
00:19:52,161 --> 00:19:54,770
What if you get a girlfriend
before I turn 20?

354
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,171
All the time I've waited for
will go in vain.

355
00:19:56,671 --> 00:19:59,171
So can you promise
that you won't get a girlfriend...

356
00:19:59,171 --> 00:20:01,641
until I turn 20?

357
00:20:02,441 --> 00:20:04,010
Are you listening to me, Dae Chung?

358
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,441
Wait for me.

359
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,621
Hey. Sun Young.

360
00:20:14,151 --> 00:20:17,220
Where were you and what were you doing?

361
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,191
Why is your phone turned off?

362
00:20:19,191 --> 00:20:21,290
My phone battery was dead.

363
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,461
Why? Did anything happen at home?

364
00:20:25,201 --> 00:20:27,101
Did something happen to Dae Chung?

365
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,601
It's your father, not Dae Chung.

366
00:20:31,101 --> 00:20:32,441
Mr. Kim.

367
00:20:33,611 --> 00:20:35,441
What about my father?

368
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,681
Don't be shocked.

369
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:43,651
Your father is dating a young lady.

370
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:47,862
My father? He's dating a young lady?

371
00:20:48,921 --> 00:20:50,391
Come on, Mother.

372
00:20:50,431 --> 00:20:52,891
My goodness. Hey, listen.

373
00:20:52,891 --> 00:20:54,661
I saw it clearly with my own eyes...

374
00:20:54,661 --> 00:20:56,971
on the bus on my way home.

375
00:20:56,971 --> 00:21:00,671
He was holding some young lady
in his arms on the street.

376
00:21:01,171 --> 00:21:02,602
Mother.

377
00:21:02,602 --> 00:21:05,471
Do you think that's what
my father would do on the street?

378
00:21:05,641 --> 00:21:07,641
You're being ridiculous.

379
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,512
Hey, it's not like
your father isn't a man.

380
00:21:11,282 --> 00:21:13,582
A man is a man even when he's old.

381
00:21:13,782 --> 00:21:14,981
You know the old saying.

382
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:17,092
An old man who's strong enough
to cross a threshold...

383
00:21:17,092 --> 00:21:18,322
can function as a man...

384
00:21:18,322 --> 00:21:19,622
- Mother!
- Gosh, you startled me.

385
00:21:20,622 --> 00:21:22,691
Why are you being like this?

386
00:21:23,362 --> 00:21:26,491
You're hard to be around
when you are like this.

387
00:21:28,302 --> 00:21:30,431
Think about what you did to Dae Chung
the other day.

388
00:21:30,572 --> 00:21:32,772
And I'm already tired from
what happened today.

389
00:21:38,112 --> 00:21:41,282
Mom, are you sure you weren't mistaken?

390
00:21:41,282 --> 00:21:43,282
You said you saw him on the bus.

391
00:21:43,751 --> 00:21:47,221
But what's with all the yelling?

392
00:21:48,522 --> 00:21:50,181
Was I mistaken?

393
00:21:51,191 --> 00:21:53,661
I was sure it was Mr. Kim.

394
00:21:54,092 --> 00:21:57,092
It's true that it isn't something
Mr. Kim would do though.

395
00:21:57,092 --> 00:21:58,161
All right.

396
00:21:58,792 --> 00:22:01,201
Sun Young. Mom says she was mistaken...

397
00:22:01,201 --> 00:22:03,032
because she is farsighted.

398
00:22:03,802 --> 00:22:05,032
Go ahead and say it.

399
00:22:05,832 --> 00:22:09,342
I'm sorry, Sun Young,
for saying such silly things.

400
00:22:11,272 --> 00:22:12,641
But I wasn't mistaken.

401
00:22:13,812 --> 00:22:16,382
I think it was Mr. Kim.

402
00:22:16,612 --> 00:22:19,282
Mom, let's just go into the room.

403
00:22:25,622 --> 00:22:29,161
I'll order some more.
Just eat your food slowly.

404
00:22:29,161 --> 00:22:31,762
Mom, can we have some more
once we finish this?

405
00:22:31,762 --> 00:22:34,102
Of course. Eat a lot.

406
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,562
I'll order as much as you want.

407
00:22:36,332 --> 00:22:39,832
Mom, I haven't had such delicious ribs
in a long time.

408
00:22:39,971 --> 00:22:42,171
I really wanted to eat this.

409
00:22:42,171 --> 00:22:44,342
You did, Do Jun?

410
00:22:44,342 --> 00:22:47,042
Make sure to eat a lot, okay?
Go ahead and eat.

411
00:22:47,112 --> 00:22:50,352
Mom, beef ribs are really expensive.

412
00:22:50,582 --> 00:22:52,352
Are you sure it's okay to eat a lot?

413
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:55,951
Mom, do you have money?

414
00:22:56,622 --> 00:22:58,522
You bought us a lot of clothes.

415
00:22:58,522 --> 00:23:00,052
We even got sneakers.

416
00:23:00,691 --> 00:23:03,122
Mom, where did you get all the money?

417
00:23:05,191 --> 00:23:09,431
I got back the money I lent someone.

418
00:23:09,832 --> 00:23:10,872
Really?

419
00:23:10,872 --> 00:23:13,772
Yes. So don't worry and just eat.

420
00:23:13,772 --> 00:23:16,572
Go ahead and eat. Let's eat.

421
00:23:21,481 --> 00:23:24,052
Do Jun, eat slowly.
You might get indigestion.

422
00:23:24,251 --> 00:23:26,852
But Do Ra and Do Sik are eating fast.

423
00:23:26,852 --> 00:23:28,921
I'll order more if you want.

424
00:23:28,921 --> 00:23:30,181
Go ahead and eat.

425
00:23:30,181 --> 00:23:32,022
Take your time and eat a lot.

426
00:23:32,191 --> 00:23:34,961
We will have
another two servings of beef ribs.

427
00:23:35,661 --> 00:23:38,231
No, we will have four servings.

428
00:23:38,231 --> 00:23:39,691
I ordered more. Let's eat.

429
00:23:39,991 --> 00:23:42,762
My gosh, what was I thinking?

430
00:23:42,762 --> 00:23:45,302
I forgot to take in the laundry.

431
00:23:55,641 --> 00:23:58,481
I'm sure it was Mr. Kim.

432
00:24:00,181 --> 00:24:02,282
I need reading glasses to see close up,

433
00:24:02,282 --> 00:24:04,592
but I have no problem seeing far away.

434
00:24:06,421 --> 00:24:07,421
Or maybe not.

435
00:24:10,262 --> 00:24:12,161
What? Hey.

436
00:24:12,161 --> 00:24:14,532
Where did you go with your whole family?

437
00:24:15,832 --> 00:24:18,501
It smells like you guys ate meat.

438
00:24:18,501 --> 00:24:20,701
Yes. We ate beef ribs.

439
00:24:20,701 --> 00:24:22,572
We ate a lot.

440
00:24:22,572 --> 00:24:24,711
I see. That sounds great.

441
00:24:24,711 --> 00:24:26,971
I'm glad you ate something nice.

442
00:24:27,911 --> 00:24:31,711
I guess you bought some stuff
at a department store.

443
00:24:31,711 --> 00:24:33,512
What's all this?

444
00:24:33,512 --> 00:24:37,052
Mom bought us new clothes and shoes.

445
00:24:37,792 --> 00:24:40,221
Oh, is that so?

446
00:24:40,221 --> 00:24:43,221
- You guys should go in. Hurry and go.
- Okay.

447
00:24:43,461 --> 00:24:45,292
- Bye, Ms. So.
- Okay.

448
00:24:45,292 --> 00:24:46,632
All right.

449
00:24:48,132 --> 00:24:49,832
I'm going in then.

450
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:51,201
Wait, Ms. Baek.

451
00:24:51,832 --> 00:24:54,602
Aren't you going to work tonight?

452
00:24:55,372 --> 00:24:57,741
No. I quit my job.

453
00:24:58,572 --> 00:25:01,241
I'll take my time and look for a new job
where I can work during the day.

454
00:25:01,241 --> 00:25:04,151
I don't want my children
to be home alone at night.

455
00:25:04,151 --> 00:25:05,512
All right then.

456
00:25:05,512 --> 00:25:07,981
That's great. My gosh.

457
00:25:08,421 --> 00:25:11,122
By the way, this mink jacket.

458
00:25:11,122 --> 00:25:13,191
I don't think it's fake fur.

459
00:25:13,352 --> 00:25:16,862
It's so soft and pretty.

460
00:25:18,062 --> 00:25:20,132
It looks like you bought a new one.

461
00:25:20,132 --> 00:25:21,501
How much did you pay?

462
00:25:22,032 --> 00:25:23,332
I bet it's expensive.

463
00:25:24,602 --> 00:25:27,241
Well, yes. Just a little.

464
00:25:27,572 --> 00:25:29,241
I'm going in then.

465
00:25:33,572 --> 00:25:34,582
What?

466
00:25:35,141 --> 00:25:37,812
Where did she get all the money...

467
00:25:37,812 --> 00:25:39,552
to buy those things?

468
00:25:44,352 --> 00:25:47,622
My goodness. That's...

469
00:25:52,032 --> 00:25:54,102
Sun Young.

470
00:25:54,102 --> 00:25:57,032
Sun Young. Hey, listen.

471
00:25:57,032 --> 00:25:59,731
Hey, about Do Ra's mom.

472
00:25:59,731 --> 00:26:00,802
My gosh.

473
00:26:00,802 --> 00:26:04,042
I bet she's dating some rich old man.

474
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,941
What are you talking about?

475
00:26:06,941 --> 00:26:09,782
She was wearing a new mink jacket.

476
00:26:09,782 --> 00:26:12,411
She went to eat beef ribs with her kids.

477
00:26:12,411 --> 00:26:15,681
And she came home
carrying all kinds of stuff she bought.

478
00:26:16,352 --> 00:26:19,022
Just a few days ago,
she ran out of rice...

479
00:26:19,022 --> 00:26:22,221
and couldn't buy more,
so she stole rice from us.

480
00:26:22,221 --> 00:26:24,931
Where do you think she got all the money
all of a sudden?

481
00:26:25,931 --> 00:26:27,201
You have a point.

482
00:26:27,431 --> 00:26:30,532
Hey, she even quit her job.

483
00:26:30,532 --> 00:26:32,602
She has three children.

484
00:26:32,602 --> 00:26:34,501
She's supposed to work
and support her kids.

485
00:26:34,971 --> 00:26:36,102
Isn't that strange?

486
00:26:37,102 --> 00:26:38,812
It is strange.

487
00:26:40,782 --> 00:26:42,342
I'm sure...

488
00:26:42,342 --> 00:26:45,451
she latched onto some rich old man.

489
00:26:45,512 --> 00:26:48,852
Mother, you can't say things like that
when she's around.

490
00:26:49,181 --> 00:26:51,751
I'm just saying this because we're alone.

491
00:26:53,151 --> 00:26:55,862
Anyway, something about her
gives me willies.

492
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:59,092
I wish...

493
00:26:59,092 --> 00:27:00,862
I could kick her out right away.

494
00:27:02,731 --> 00:27:03,832
Sun Young.

495
00:27:04,602 --> 00:27:06,731
Speaking of which...

496
00:27:06,731 --> 00:27:08,971
Don't be upset with what I say.

497
00:27:09,171 --> 00:27:11,441
Can you nonchalantly...

498
00:27:12,072 --> 00:27:16,042
ask your father if he's seeing...

499
00:27:16,941 --> 00:27:18,782
anyone special?

500
00:27:18,782 --> 00:27:21,651
Mother, you said you saw wrong.

501
00:27:22,181 --> 00:27:24,352
You never know when it comes to people.

502
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:26,451
Besides, being cautious
never hurts anyone.

503
00:27:26,991 --> 00:27:29,461
It's just that what I saw today...

504
00:27:29,562 --> 00:27:32,032
was deeply concerning and eerie.

505
00:27:32,032 --> 00:27:33,062
Mother, please.

506
00:27:33,592 --> 00:27:36,602
Okay, fine. I hear you.

507
00:27:37,102 --> 00:27:39,032
Other men in this world
can be blinded by love,

508
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:41,072
but that will never happen
with your father.

509
00:27:42,501 --> 00:27:43,501
Sun Young,

510
00:27:44,141 --> 00:27:47,941
did you get a herbal tonic
only for your father again?

511
00:27:49,241 --> 00:27:50,751
I'll get you some next time.

512
00:27:50,882 --> 00:27:53,282
What? What the...

513
00:27:53,951 --> 00:27:55,981
That cheeky girl.

514
00:27:55,981 --> 00:27:59,191
She always puts me
on the back burner like that.

515
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:02,122
You know what? I...

516
00:28:09,161 --> 00:28:11,102
Dad, drink up.

517
00:28:11,832 --> 00:28:14,241
Why did you get me
another batch of herbal tonics?

518
00:28:14,241 --> 00:28:16,272
You should've gotten some
for Hyun Chul instead.

519
00:28:16,272 --> 00:28:19,741
He's still fairly young
and isn't in need of this.

520
00:28:20,171 --> 00:28:22,512
I don't need it either.
I'm still going strong.

521
00:28:23,312 --> 00:28:25,411
I can't live without you, Dad.

522
00:28:25,552 --> 00:28:28,622
You need to stay by my side
for decades to come.

523
00:28:29,352 --> 00:28:30,852
Drink up while it's still warm.

524
00:28:33,251 --> 00:28:34,292
Sure.

525
00:28:38,391 --> 00:28:40,461
You never know when it comes to people.

526
00:28:40,461 --> 00:28:42,661
Besides, being cautious
never hurts anyone.

527
00:28:43,102 --> 00:28:45,572
It's just that what I saw today...

528
00:28:45,731 --> 00:28:48,171
was deeply concerning and eerie.

529
00:28:52,072 --> 00:28:53,141
Dad.

530
00:28:54,882 --> 00:28:56,941
What is it? Do you have something to say?

531
00:28:59,651 --> 00:29:02,882
Gosh, no. Have a candy.

532
00:29:03,181 --> 00:29:04,191
Right.

533
00:29:07,421 --> 00:29:08,721
Thank you, my daughter.

534
00:29:26,141 --> 00:29:28,512
Mom, it's so nice
to have you with us at night.

535
00:29:28,711 --> 00:29:30,512
- What?
- Same here.

536
00:29:30,751 --> 00:29:31,782
Are you that happy?

537
00:29:31,782 --> 00:29:32,951
- Yes.
- Yes, I am.

538
00:29:33,082 --> 00:29:34,981
Goodness. You see,

539
00:29:35,181 --> 00:29:38,221
I won't be working any more night shifts.

540
00:29:38,352 --> 00:29:40,322
Hurrah. Really?

541
00:29:40,322 --> 00:29:41,991
- Yes.
- Really, mom?

542
00:29:41,991 --> 00:29:43,292
- Really?
- Yes.

543
00:29:43,562 --> 00:29:46,461
And that pleases me as well.
How nice is this?

544
00:29:46,461 --> 00:29:49,802
I'm happy to stay home at night
rather than working odd jobs.

545
00:29:49,802 --> 00:29:52,102
How nice is this? My puppies.

546
00:29:52,102 --> 00:29:53,201
- Are you pleased?
- Yes.

547
00:29:53,201 --> 00:29:56,641
Is that so? I'm happy about this as well.

548
00:29:56,941 --> 00:29:59,542
Let's go back to bed, then. Come on.

549
00:29:59,842 --> 00:30:01,512
Let's go to bed.

550
00:30:02,181 --> 00:30:04,812
It's nice not to be working night shifts.

551
00:30:05,582 --> 00:30:06,681
Goodness.

552
00:30:11,421 --> 00:30:14,891
Tomorrow,
I'll have Dae Chung promise me...

553
00:30:15,391 --> 00:30:17,632
that he'll stay single until I'm 20.

554
00:30:40,481 --> 00:30:42,352
I wonder what's up with Dae Chung.

555
00:30:44,522 --> 00:30:45,691
Where is he going?

556
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:53,161
(Sol Hair Salon)

557
00:30:53,161 --> 00:30:55,231
- All right. I'll get going, Auntie.
- Sure.

558
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:03,042
- Jung Mi.
- Dae Chung, what the...

559
00:31:05,772 --> 00:31:07,512
- Dae Chung.
- Jung Mi.

560
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:09,312
Have you been well?

561
00:31:09,741 --> 00:31:11,612
Why haven't you been taking my calls?

562
00:31:11,651 --> 00:31:13,711
I've been waiting day and night
for you to reach out.

563
00:31:13,981 --> 00:31:15,251
I'm sorry, Dae Chung.

564
00:31:16,151 --> 00:31:17,651
I missed you a lot.

565
00:31:17,921 --> 00:31:20,122
I missed you a lot as well.

566
00:31:20,491 --> 00:31:22,362
So why didn't you contact me?

567
00:31:23,191 --> 00:31:24,461
I'm sorry, Dae Chung.

568
00:31:25,231 --> 00:31:26,262
I'm so sorry.

569
00:31:27,292 --> 00:31:28,961
But we can't do this.

570
00:31:29,562 --> 00:31:30,762
That's why I didn't call you.

571
00:31:32,072 --> 00:31:37,102
Jung Mi, I can't explain everything
that has happened to me recently,

572
00:31:38,141 --> 00:31:41,042
but I'm asking you
to wait one year for me.

573
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,181
Just until I take my CSAT.

574
00:31:45,082 --> 00:31:47,582
After I take my CSAT, I'll come find you.

575
00:31:48,151 --> 00:31:50,451
All right. I'll wait for you.

576
00:31:51,991 --> 00:31:54,461
- Jung Mi.
- Dae Chung.

577
00:31:54,762 --> 00:31:56,721
It's been so long.

578
00:31:57,092 --> 00:31:59,832
- Have you lost weight?
- Hey! Get away from each other.

579
00:32:00,032 --> 00:32:02,201
Untangle yourselves this second!

580
00:32:02,201 --> 00:32:05,102
- Whose business are you trying to ruin...
- Auntie, don't be like that to him.

581
00:32:05,102 --> 00:32:07,401
You! Go home, darn it.

582
00:32:07,401 --> 00:32:08,772
- Get over here. Here's your cab.
- Dae Chung.

583
00:32:08,772 --> 00:32:11,141
- Get over here.
- Dae Chung!

584
00:32:11,141 --> 00:32:12,741
Forget about him and get in.

585
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:14,012
- Jung Mi.
- Go.

586
00:32:14,012 --> 00:32:16,042
- Sir, drive off.
- Jung Mi.

587
00:32:16,042 --> 00:32:17,882
Sir, keep driving. Hey!

588
00:32:18,552 --> 00:32:19,552
Jung Mi!

589
00:32:20,082 --> 00:32:22,022
Don't forget what I said.

590
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:25,951
It'll be one year.

591
00:32:26,391 --> 00:32:28,391
In a year's time, we'll meet again.

592
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:30,362
Jung Mi!

593
00:32:34,632 --> 00:32:35,862
Dae Chung,

594
00:32:37,701 --> 00:32:39,832
how could you do this to me?

595
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,802
You're still hung up on her,

596
00:32:45,512 --> 00:32:48,342
so why did you say we'd talk again
once I'm 20?

597
00:32:49,741 --> 00:32:52,052
Dae Chung, you're mean,

598
00:32:53,382 --> 00:32:54,582
and I want nothing to do with you.

599
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:01,961
Myung Dong, hey. What am I hearing?

600
00:33:03,191 --> 00:33:04,991
- Someone's whistling.
- My gosh.

601
00:33:07,632 --> 00:33:09,032
Goodness, Mr. Kim.

602
00:33:10,332 --> 00:33:12,401
I don't think
I've heard you whistle before.

603
00:33:12,802 --> 00:33:14,471
You're quite good at it.

604
00:33:14,741 --> 00:33:16,842
Was that "Paper Crane?"

605
00:33:16,842 --> 00:33:18,012
That's right.

606
00:33:19,612 --> 00:33:21,282
- I'll be off, then.
- Sure.

607
00:33:21,282 --> 00:33:22,641
Have a good day.

608
00:33:25,711 --> 00:33:27,951
My gosh. What are we going to do?

609
00:33:28,221 --> 00:33:29,751
He's going around whistling now.

610
00:33:30,751 --> 00:33:32,622
Where on earth is your sister-in-law?

611
00:33:32,622 --> 00:33:34,661
She should've heard him whistling.

612
00:33:35,391 --> 00:33:36,661
Did she go to the dry cleaner's?

613
00:33:41,762 --> 00:33:43,032
Mom, where are you going?

614
00:33:45,701 --> 00:33:47,132
What... Mom!

615
00:33:47,872 --> 00:33:49,001
Mom!

616
00:33:52,941 --> 00:33:54,012
Ms. Baek.

617
00:33:55,812 --> 00:33:56,882
You're here.

618
00:33:57,282 --> 00:34:00,352
Why did you ask me to meet you here?

619
00:34:00,382 --> 00:34:04,691
There's a place down this alley
that serves a mean loach soup.

620
00:34:04,691 --> 00:34:06,151
I wanted to treat you to a bowl.

621
00:34:06,622 --> 00:34:08,862
- Do you like loach soup?
- Yes, I do.

622
00:34:09,721 --> 00:34:12,391
Let's go, then.
We'll enjoy loach soup on our date today.

623
00:34:12,391 --> 00:34:13,532
Right.

624
00:34:14,132 --> 00:34:16,461
- Gosh.
- Watch your step.

625
00:34:16,461 --> 00:34:18,632
Sure. You too, Ms. Baek.

626
00:34:18,632 --> 00:34:20,972
The pavement isn't all that smooth.

627
00:34:20,972 --> 00:34:21,972
Right.

628
00:34:22,642 --> 00:34:26,612
Still, having our arms locked like this
makes it feel like a real date.

629
00:34:26,612 --> 00:34:27,612
I see.

630
00:34:37,421 --> 00:34:38,791
Do you find that pretty?

631
00:34:39,351 --> 00:34:41,561
Gosh, no. I was just looking.

632
00:34:42,592 --> 00:34:44,092
Let's go inside. I'll buy you one.

633
00:34:44,262 --> 00:34:47,092
Gosh, no. As if someone like me
needs any jewelry.

634
00:34:47,092 --> 00:34:48,802
That isn't necessary.

635
00:34:48,802 --> 00:34:51,601
I want to get you something,
so follow me inside.

636
00:34:54,541 --> 00:34:56,572
This really isn't necessary.

637
00:35:03,441 --> 00:35:08,182
The necklace compliments
your beautiful face.

638
00:35:08,952 --> 00:35:10,282
- Really?
- Yes.

639
00:35:12,592 --> 00:35:13,691
Do you like it?

640
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,921
Yes, I love it.

641
00:35:20,662 --> 00:35:23,032
This is also just as pretty.

642
00:35:24,101 --> 00:35:26,472
Wait. That's Do Ra's mom.

643
00:35:27,132 --> 00:35:29,671
Hold on. They were walking arm in arm...

644
00:35:29,671 --> 00:35:31,001
in the middle of the day.

645
00:35:32,941 --> 00:35:36,612
Then, that woman I saw
in front of the bank...

646
00:35:36,612 --> 00:35:37,882
must've also been her.

647
00:35:38,882 --> 00:35:40,351
Goodness me.

648
00:35:41,382 --> 00:35:44,651
That sly minx.

649
00:35:45,691 --> 00:35:49,291
Has Mr. Kim lost his mind?

650
00:35:49,722 --> 00:35:51,731
I need evidence.

651
00:35:52,061 --> 00:35:53,791
My phone. Darn it.

652
00:35:53,992 --> 00:35:56,802
Why did you leave without your phone
at this crucial moment?

653
00:36:04,101 --> 00:36:07,842
My gosh. These mandarins look great.

654
00:36:09,811 --> 00:36:12,211
- I'm glad you came by today.
- Hey.

655
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:14,822
I was actually going to call you.

656
00:36:15,822 --> 00:36:17,892
Me? About what?

657
00:36:19,392 --> 00:36:21,362
I don't know if I should be saying this.

658
00:36:22,961 --> 00:36:27,092
Still, I thought you should know.

659
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:30,932
What is it? You can tell me.

660
00:36:32,472 --> 00:36:35,742
You know my daughter works at the bank
at the intersection.

661
00:36:36,202 --> 00:36:37,242
Yes, of course.

662
00:36:39,342 --> 00:36:41,041
My daughter told me...

663
00:36:41,311 --> 00:36:44,612
Dae Chung's grandpa, Mr. Kim,

664
00:36:44,882 --> 00:36:47,081
took out 30,000 dollars
and gave it to that woman.

665
00:36:48,552 --> 00:36:49,581
What...

666
00:36:50,452 --> 00:36:52,452
My father... What woman?

667
00:36:52,751 --> 00:36:55,492
Do Ra's mom
who's been renting a room at your place.

668
00:36:56,121 --> 00:36:59,561
Why did Mr. Kim hand her that much money?

669
00:36:59,862 --> 00:37:00,961
What?

670
00:37:05,271 --> 00:37:06,871
My dad gave Do Ra's mom...

671
00:37:07,771 --> 00:37:09,601
a total of 30,000 dollars?

672
00:37:15,493 --> 00:37:17,463
No, that can't be.

673
00:37:18,763 --> 00:37:20,733
My dad and Do Ra's mom?

674
00:37:21,562 --> 00:37:23,472
But the age gap is huge.

675
00:37:24,673 --> 00:37:26,972
My dad with a woman
that much younger than him?

676
00:37:27,943 --> 00:37:30,513
- A woman who applies blue eye shadow?
- Hey!

677
00:37:30,513 --> 00:37:33,542
Sun Young!

678
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:34,883
- Mother...
- Sun Young.

679
00:37:34,883 --> 00:37:37,713
Mother, what now?

680
00:37:38,082 --> 00:37:40,252
Sun Young, I was right all along.

681
00:37:40,252 --> 00:37:41,883
- What I saw was right.
- What?

682
00:37:41,883 --> 00:37:45,122
Do you know who the woman is?

683
00:37:45,222 --> 00:37:46,693
- It's Do Ra's mom.
- What?

684
00:37:46,693 --> 00:37:48,162
Do Ra's mom, our tenant!

685
00:37:48,162 --> 00:37:51,263
I saw them just now with my very own eyes.

686
00:37:51,263 --> 00:37:53,332
They went into a jewelry shop arm in arm,

687
00:37:53,332 --> 00:37:56,872
and she laughed like this
while trying on a necklace.

688
00:37:56,872 --> 00:37:58,472
Sun Young!

689
00:37:58,832 --> 00:38:00,142
Sun Young?

690
00:38:00,142 --> 00:38:02,002
- Sun Young.
- Honey, my gosh.

691
00:38:02,002 --> 00:38:03,472
- Honey, what's wrong?
- Sun Young.

692
00:38:03,472 --> 00:38:04,642
- Wake up.
- Oh, dear.

693
00:38:04,642 --> 00:38:06,582
- Mom.
- What?

694
00:38:06,582 --> 00:38:08,713
Here. Take it easy.

695
00:38:09,752 --> 00:38:10,812
Gosh.

696
00:38:10,812 --> 00:38:11,883
Sun Young, here.

697
00:38:12,013 --> 00:38:13,182
Right.

698
00:38:13,622 --> 00:38:16,093
Have some water first.

699
00:38:16,493 --> 00:38:17,522
Go ahead.

700
00:38:20,522 --> 00:38:22,662
Are you okay?

701
00:38:23,033 --> 00:38:25,493
Are you sure you don't need a doctor?

702
00:38:26,062 --> 00:38:30,633
I mean, even I'm in shock over this news,

703
00:38:30,633 --> 00:38:32,202
so I can imagine how she's feeling.

704
00:38:32,903 --> 00:38:36,213
He was buying a gold necklace for her
at the jewelry store.

705
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:39,073
You should have seen the look in his eyes.

706
00:38:39,073 --> 00:38:42,613
Love was dripping from his eyes
as he was looking at her.

707
00:38:42,613 --> 00:38:44,283
It's as the youngsters say.

708
00:38:44,283 --> 00:38:46,452
He's totally nuts about her.

709
00:38:46,452 --> 00:38:49,423
My gosh.
That sly minx that is Do Ra's mom...

710
00:38:49,423 --> 00:38:51,622
must've seduced Mr. Kim.

711
00:38:51,622 --> 00:38:55,193
She had him fall head over heels for her.

712
00:38:56,432 --> 00:39:00,463
What did I say about her being bad news?

713
00:39:00,733 --> 00:39:03,073
We let a gold digger into our house.

714
00:39:05,633 --> 00:39:06,702
- What...
- Hey.

715
00:39:06,702 --> 00:39:08,303
- Sun Young?
- Sun Young?

716
00:39:09,202 --> 00:39:10,912
What on earth are you saying?

717
00:39:11,213 --> 00:39:13,582
Are you saying
I've been seducing your father...

718
00:39:13,582 --> 00:39:16,283
because of his money?

719
00:39:16,283 --> 00:39:20,522
How else can you explain
my dad lending you that much money...

720
00:39:20,923 --> 00:39:22,452
if he's not getting anything in return?

721
00:39:23,892 --> 00:39:26,323
That hardly sounds like a question to me.

722
00:39:26,323 --> 00:39:27,662
You should ask Mr. Kim...

723
00:39:27,662 --> 00:39:30,863
if I ever asked him for that money.

724
00:39:30,863 --> 00:39:32,392
He offered it up first,

725
00:39:32,392 --> 00:39:34,963
so I only accepted it as a loan.

726
00:39:35,463 --> 00:39:36,733
Is that true?

727
00:39:37,033 --> 00:39:39,642
Ask your father if you don't believe me.

728
00:39:40,702 --> 00:39:43,872
Not having anything to my name
and being your tenant...

729
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:46,243
doesn't give you the right
to accuse me this way.

730
00:39:46,243 --> 00:39:48,983
I'll pay him back the darn money.

731
00:39:49,042 --> 00:39:51,082
How can you make me out to be someone...

732
00:39:51,082 --> 00:39:53,252
who's trying to hustle an old man
out of his fortune?

733
00:39:57,392 --> 00:39:58,722
I get it for now.

734
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:08,803
My gosh.

735
00:40:08,803 --> 00:40:11,102
Gosh. How on earth did she find out?

736
00:40:11,102 --> 00:40:12,903
What do I do?

737
00:40:16,513 --> 00:40:18,312
Dad, where are you right now?

738
00:40:28,952 --> 00:40:30,792
We're home.

739
00:40:34,392 --> 00:40:35,562
Dad.

740
00:40:37,193 --> 00:40:38,963
Why are you out here in the cold?

741
00:40:39,432 --> 00:40:40,633
What the...

742
00:40:41,662 --> 00:40:44,472
Are you coming back from somewhere
with Do Jun?

743
00:40:44,472 --> 00:40:48,102
Do Jun and I went out
for some jjajangmyeon.

744
00:40:48,343 --> 00:40:51,673
Mr. Kim got me jjajangmyeon, tangsuyuk,

745
00:40:51,843 --> 00:40:53,483
and even a new game console...

746
00:40:54,042 --> 00:40:56,213
even though it isn't even Christmas.

747
00:40:56,713 --> 00:40:58,483
Dad, why would you...

748
00:40:58,613 --> 00:41:01,582
buy him jjajangmyeon and a game console?

749
00:41:01,582 --> 00:41:02,752
Sun Young, please.

750
00:41:05,653 --> 00:41:07,622
Dad, we need to talk.

751
00:41:12,033 --> 00:41:13,202
Mr. Kim.

752
00:41:13,963 --> 00:41:16,332
Ms. Kim sounded angry.

753
00:41:16,633 --> 00:41:18,303
No, she's not angry at all.

754
00:41:18,303 --> 00:41:20,542
It's all right.

755
00:41:22,812 --> 00:41:24,312
Is it true...

756
00:41:24,713 --> 00:41:28,013
that you lent her 30,000 dollars?

757
00:41:30,013 --> 00:41:31,013
Yes.

758
00:41:33,153 --> 00:41:34,252
But...

759
00:41:34,983 --> 00:41:36,292
But why?

760
00:41:37,252 --> 00:41:40,263
How can you trust her enough
to lend her that much money?

761
00:41:42,022 --> 00:41:44,062
I can't allow this. I'll go to her...

762
00:41:44,062 --> 00:41:45,963
and ask for it back.

763
00:41:45,963 --> 00:41:48,133
- Right now...
- Don't.

764
00:41:48,903 --> 00:41:51,303
I let her have the money.

765
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:53,972
What?

766
00:41:55,002 --> 00:41:57,013
You just gave it to her?

767
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:00,582
My gosh.

768
00:42:00,582 --> 00:42:02,283
Hyun Chul.

769
00:42:02,283 --> 00:42:05,553
What on earth
did your father-in-law mean by that?

770
00:42:06,622 --> 00:42:10,022
He didn't lend her the money
but gave it to her to spend.

771
00:42:10,622 --> 00:42:13,522
Goodness me.

772
00:42:13,522 --> 00:42:16,693
It wasn't 30 dollars, 300 dollars,

773
00:42:16,693 --> 00:42:17,993
but 30,000 dollars.

774
00:42:18,733 --> 00:42:19,733
My gosh.

775
00:42:19,733 --> 00:42:23,173
Mr. Kim must be out of his mind.

776
00:42:23,303 --> 00:42:25,002
Could he have dementia?

777
00:42:25,002 --> 00:42:27,502
Mom, stop it!

778
00:42:28,102 --> 00:42:29,102
What's going on?

779
00:42:29,102 --> 00:42:30,843
Dae Chung, quiet.

780
00:42:31,843 --> 00:42:35,542
Dad, what did you just say?

781
00:42:36,553 --> 00:42:39,412
You didn't lend her the money
but just gave it to her instead?

782
00:42:39,553 --> 00:42:40,553
That's right.

783
00:42:41,082 --> 00:42:42,682
And let me repeat myself.

784
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:46,463
Do Ra's mom never asked me for any money,

785
00:42:47,562 --> 00:42:49,662
so don't confront her about it.

786
00:42:50,662 --> 00:42:53,062
I just want to know why.

787
00:42:53,233 --> 00:42:54,963
She never asked for a loan,

788
00:42:54,963 --> 00:42:56,633
so why did you give her the money?

789
00:42:56,633 --> 00:42:57,872
Why?

790
00:42:57,872 --> 00:43:00,102
Who is she to you anyway?

791
00:43:00,772 --> 00:43:02,343
I just wanted to.

792
00:43:04,213 --> 00:43:05,743
I wanted to give her the money.

793
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,682
I couldn't bear the sight
of seeing her in agony.

794
00:43:11,952 --> 00:43:12,952
Dad...

795
00:43:15,022 --> 00:43:16,722
Dad, do you...

796
00:43:17,653 --> 00:43:18,852
Do you...

797
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:20,222
That's right.

798
00:43:21,863 --> 00:43:23,562
I have feelings for her.

799
00:43:26,033 --> 00:43:27,403
It's why I gave her the money.

800
00:43:30,133 --> 00:43:31,233
Dad...

801
00:43:45,912 --> 00:43:47,383
What now?

802
00:43:48,222 --> 00:43:49,952
Didn't you talk to your father?

803
00:43:53,392 --> 00:43:55,423
I talked to him.

804
00:43:57,332 --> 00:43:58,392
He said...

805
00:43:59,363 --> 00:44:02,662
he just let you borrow the money.

806
00:44:04,502 --> 00:44:08,202
See? What did I tell you?

807
00:44:11,312 --> 00:44:13,013
That being said,

808
00:44:14,343 --> 00:44:17,783
my father seems to like you a lot.

809
00:44:19,452 --> 00:44:22,222
He has been alone and lonely
for a long time.

810
00:44:24,452 --> 00:44:26,292
So if it's okay with you,

811
00:44:26,823 --> 00:44:29,493
I was thinking
about approving your relationship.

812
00:44:31,792 --> 00:44:33,903
Despite the huge age gap,

813
00:44:34,763 --> 00:44:36,332
as long as you both like each other...

814
00:44:36,332 --> 00:44:37,372
What?

815
00:44:37,932 --> 00:44:39,173
What did you just say?

816
00:44:39,872 --> 00:44:42,073
What on earth did you mean by that?

817
00:44:44,113 --> 00:44:47,513
You knitted a muffler for him to wear...

818
00:44:48,312 --> 00:44:51,113
and also went on dates with him.

819
00:44:51,513 --> 00:44:54,222
Seriously. Are you out of your mind?
Did you call them dates?

820
00:44:54,222 --> 00:44:55,983
We had a few drinks together one time...

821
00:44:55,983 --> 00:44:57,522
and we went to the movies once...

822
00:44:57,522 --> 00:45:00,562
only because I happened
to have an extra ticket.

823
00:45:00,562 --> 00:45:04,292
And I knitted the muffler
since I was grateful...

824
00:45:04,292 --> 00:45:06,093
for the loan.

825
00:45:06,093 --> 00:45:07,432
That's all.

826
00:45:09,533 --> 00:45:11,272
Are you saying...

827
00:45:11,272 --> 00:45:14,243
you had no feelings
for my father whatsoever?

828
00:45:14,602 --> 00:45:16,872
Then why did you accept
the money he gave you?

829
00:45:17,272 --> 00:45:19,843
There must've been a reason
you accepted his money.

830
00:45:19,843 --> 00:45:21,883
Look here.
You'd better watch what you say.

831
00:45:21,883 --> 00:45:26,283
If it were you, would you like
to fool around with a grandpa?

832
00:45:27,383 --> 00:45:28,653
What the...

833
00:45:29,653 --> 00:45:31,553
My gosh. Dad.

834
00:45:33,193 --> 00:45:36,892
Gosh, Mr. Kim. I'm glad you're out here.

835
00:45:37,363 --> 00:45:40,903
When did I ever say
I liked you romantically?

836
00:45:41,932 --> 00:45:45,332
When did I ever ask you for money?

837
00:45:45,372 --> 00:45:47,042
Me linking arms with yours?

838
00:45:47,042 --> 00:45:49,772
I was trying to help you walk better.

839
00:45:49,772 --> 00:45:52,573
Did you think of it
as an affectionate gesture?

840
00:45:52,573 --> 00:45:53,883
What the...

841
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,213
Have you lost it?

842
00:45:55,213 --> 00:45:57,383
Consider our huge age gap.

843
00:45:57,383 --> 00:45:58,912
Also, that money.

844
00:45:58,912 --> 00:46:02,483
Did you lend me the money
so that you could win me over?

845
00:46:02,622 --> 00:46:04,022
Seriously.

846
00:46:04,022 --> 00:46:06,292
Look here, old man. That money of yours?

847
00:46:06,292 --> 00:46:07,792
I'll pay you back
if it's the last thing I do.

848
00:46:07,792 --> 00:46:11,133
I'll sell my body
if I must to pay you back!

849
00:46:11,233 --> 00:46:12,292
My gosh.

850
00:46:12,363 --> 00:46:16,602
How dare you try to dump an old man on me?

851
00:46:16,673 --> 00:46:19,843
What gives you the right
to talk like that?

852
00:46:20,202 --> 00:46:21,403
Father!

853
00:46:21,943 --> 00:46:24,513
Dad!

854
00:46:24,872 --> 00:46:26,812
Dad, wake up. Dad.

855
00:46:27,042 --> 00:46:29,182
Open your eyes!

856
00:46:30,452 --> 00:46:32,752
Call for an ambulance right now!

857
00:46:35,383 --> 00:46:39,093
(Paramedics)

858
00:46:42,493 --> 00:46:44,162
How far off are we?

859
00:46:44,633 --> 00:46:45,792
Less than five minutes away.

860
00:46:53,542 --> 00:46:54,772
Sun Young.

861
00:46:55,642 --> 00:46:56,642
Dad.

862
00:46:57,743 --> 00:46:58,843
You'll be fine.

863
00:46:59,472 --> 00:47:00,843
Nothing bad will happen.

864
00:47:02,483 --> 00:47:04,412
My dear Sun Young.

865
00:47:05,883 --> 00:47:07,483
Thank you.

866
00:47:08,983 --> 00:47:10,722
Why would you say that?

867
00:47:11,653 --> 00:47:14,693
Dad. Stay with me.

868
00:47:16,932 --> 00:47:18,033
Sun Young.

869
00:47:19,093 --> 00:47:21,263
Listen to me carefully.

870
00:47:22,102 --> 00:47:23,133
Okay.

871
00:47:23,803 --> 00:47:24,903
Sun Young.

872
00:47:25,972 --> 00:47:30,272
I have no regrets at all.

873
00:47:31,213 --> 00:47:33,513
I don't resent anyone.

874
00:47:34,713 --> 00:47:39,082
So don't blame that woman.

875
00:47:39,952 --> 00:47:41,053
And...

876
00:47:42,022 --> 00:47:44,823
don't let her pay you back.

877
00:47:48,193 --> 00:47:50,733
Don't say that, Dad.

878
00:47:51,892 --> 00:47:55,202
Okay. I got it, so don't say that.

879
00:47:56,062 --> 00:47:58,502
Dad. Hang in there.

880
00:47:59,233 --> 00:48:00,702
We're almost there.

881
00:48:00,972 --> 00:48:02,772
The hospital's not far off.

882
00:48:03,812 --> 00:48:05,642
You'll be fine.

883
00:48:06,713 --> 00:48:08,082
My dear daughter.

884
00:48:09,542 --> 00:48:11,013
My little girl.

885
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:14,553
Sun Young.

886
00:48:15,883 --> 00:48:18,323
Thanks for everything.

887
00:48:20,093 --> 00:48:21,122
Dad.

888
00:48:23,263 --> 00:48:26,463
Dad. No!

889
00:48:27,263 --> 00:48:29,702
Dad. Don't do this.

890
00:48:29,702 --> 00:48:31,332
Do something. Help him.

891
00:48:32,233 --> 00:48:33,272
Oh, dear.

892
00:48:34,042 --> 00:48:38,443
What have I done? I was out of my mind.

893
00:48:39,372 --> 00:48:42,412
Why did I say such things?

894
00:48:43,113 --> 00:48:44,783
I should've thought of what could happen.

895
00:48:46,852 --> 00:48:49,053
I hope Mr. Kim will be okay.

896
00:48:49,952 --> 00:48:52,722
Oh, dear...

897
00:48:52,852 --> 00:48:54,392
What's wrong, Mom?

898
00:48:54,392 --> 00:48:55,423
What?

899
00:48:56,193 --> 00:48:58,733
Mom. Do you owe someone else money?

900
00:48:59,733 --> 00:49:02,702
No, it's not that. It's nothing.

901
00:49:03,102 --> 00:49:07,202
I have to go somewhere. I won't be long.

902
00:49:07,202 --> 00:49:08,272
See you.

903
00:49:09,142 --> 00:49:12,173
No way. It's such a mess.

904
00:49:19,713 --> 00:49:20,783
What?

905
00:49:21,022 --> 00:49:23,823
What did you just say?

906
00:49:24,022 --> 00:49:28,162
Kim Jun Sub died from a heart attack
caused by excessive stress.

907
00:49:29,122 --> 00:49:30,562
Go to the funeral hall.

908
00:49:31,233 --> 00:49:32,292
Nurse.

909
00:49:32,633 --> 00:49:35,533
No. No way. It can't be.

910
00:49:35,533 --> 00:49:37,772
What should I do now?

911
00:49:38,432 --> 00:49:40,042
What do I do?

912
00:49:40,502 --> 00:49:42,772
What now? What am I to do?

913
00:49:43,343 --> 00:49:45,713
What should I do from now on?

914
00:49:46,113 --> 00:49:47,412
Oh, gosh.

915
00:49:55,852 --> 00:49:56,892
Hyun Chul.

916
00:49:57,823 --> 00:49:59,823
The staff want to discuss something.

917
00:49:59,823 --> 00:50:01,093
Okay.

918
00:50:17,272 --> 00:50:20,613
Is Grandpa really dead?

919
00:50:22,682 --> 00:50:24,452
He was alive just a while ago.

920
00:50:25,812 --> 00:50:27,653
It doesn't make sense.

921
00:50:29,182 --> 00:50:31,522
Where did Grandpa go?

922
00:50:34,022 --> 00:50:35,222
You're right, Dae Chung.

923
00:50:37,662 --> 00:50:39,332
Your grandpa isn't dead.

924
00:50:41,133 --> 00:50:43,002
I should go and check again.

925
00:50:43,803 --> 00:50:45,173
Sun Young.

926
00:50:45,173 --> 00:50:48,403
- Honey! My dad isn't dead.
- Mom.

927
00:50:48,642 --> 00:50:50,542
I don't think he's dead.

928
00:50:50,642 --> 00:50:53,243
- Mom.
- Don't be like this, Sun Young.

929
00:50:53,243 --> 00:50:55,542
Calm down, honey. Don't do this.

930
00:50:55,542 --> 00:50:58,412
No! My dad's not dead.

931
00:50:58,483 --> 00:51:00,582
He isn't dead!

932
00:51:01,323 --> 00:51:04,752
He'd never die, leaving me all alone!

933
00:51:05,022 --> 00:51:07,662
There's no way he'd do that!

934
00:51:07,662 --> 00:51:09,593
- Sun Young.
- Oh, dear.

935
00:51:09,593 --> 00:51:11,993
- Sun Young. Try to calm down.
- Dad!

936
00:51:12,332 --> 00:51:13,633
Sun Young.

937
00:51:14,702 --> 00:51:16,303
Dad.

938
00:51:16,972 --> 00:51:18,332
Sun Young.

939
00:51:19,073 --> 00:51:20,602
Mom.

940
00:51:20,872 --> 00:51:23,472
Oh, my gosh.

941
00:51:24,613 --> 00:51:26,713
Why must we go through this...

942
00:51:26,983 --> 00:51:30,483
because of a gold digger we let in?

943
00:51:31,452 --> 00:51:32,713
Oh, gosh.

944
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:37,053
I feel so sorry for poor Mr. Kim.

945
00:51:37,823 --> 00:51:42,022
He was so good
he could live without the law.

946
00:51:44,733 --> 00:51:45,763
Gosh.

947
00:51:46,093 --> 00:51:49,202
Look. Over there.

948
00:51:49,502 --> 00:51:51,972
Look. It's the witch.

949
00:51:51,972 --> 00:51:55,303
How dare you show your face here?

950
00:51:55,903 --> 00:51:58,243
- Mom.
- You!

951
00:51:59,243 --> 00:52:00,642
Oh, my gosh.

952
00:52:00,642 --> 00:52:02,642
- Sun Young.
- Get that witch!

953
00:52:02,642 --> 00:52:04,082
- You!
- Mom!

954
00:52:04,082 --> 00:52:06,312
You evil wench!

955
00:52:07,323 --> 00:52:10,352
You nasty thing! How could you?

956
00:52:10,622 --> 00:52:12,423
You'll rot for this!

957
00:52:12,923 --> 00:52:14,622
How could you?

958
00:52:15,062 --> 00:52:16,662
Get over here!

959
00:52:16,863 --> 00:52:18,733
You killed my dad!

960
00:52:19,033 --> 00:52:21,332
You'll pay for it!

961
00:52:21,332 --> 00:52:22,633
Stop it!

962
00:52:22,903 --> 00:52:24,903
He's gone because of you!

963
00:52:25,002 --> 00:52:27,743
- I'll kill you too!
- Will you let go?

964
00:52:39,252 --> 00:52:41,553
- You evil thing!
- Get back here!

965
00:52:41,553 --> 00:52:44,993
- You won't get away with this!
- You witch!

966
00:52:46,392 --> 00:52:48,162
- How could you?
- Honey.

967
00:52:48,292 --> 00:52:51,332
Did you come here to see...

968
00:52:51,533 --> 00:52:53,702
if he was really dead, you witch?

969
00:52:54,263 --> 00:52:57,772
How could you?
The deities will make you pay!

970
00:52:57,903 --> 00:52:59,073
Wait and see!

971
00:53:07,483 --> 00:53:09,443
Park Do Ra. Do Sik.

972
00:53:09,713 --> 00:53:11,852
- Get up now! Wake up.
- What for?

973
00:53:11,852 --> 00:53:14,053
- What is it, Mom?
- What's going on?

974
00:53:14,053 --> 00:53:15,522
Pack your things right now.

975
00:53:15,783 --> 00:53:17,252
We must leave immediately.

976
00:53:18,622 --> 00:53:20,522
Mom. We're moving again?

977
00:53:21,122 --> 00:53:22,162
Why?

978
00:53:22,162 --> 00:53:24,292
Don't ask! Just get packing!

979
00:53:24,562 --> 00:53:26,832
- Darn it.
- I don't want to move.

980
00:53:27,403 --> 00:53:31,173
Grandpa Kim said he'd teach me
how to play baduk tomorrow.

981
00:53:31,173 --> 00:53:32,673
You'll be the death of me!

982
00:53:33,332 --> 00:53:35,372
Move it, Do Ra! Pack your stuff!

983
00:53:37,243 --> 00:53:39,843
Do Jun, get changed. Hurry.

984
00:53:39,943 --> 00:53:41,743
No! I won't go!

985
00:53:42,343 --> 00:53:44,483
I'll stay here!

986
00:53:44,653 --> 00:53:46,613
I like it here!

987
00:53:46,613 --> 00:53:49,553
My gosh. Why won't you listen to Mom?

988
00:53:49,553 --> 00:53:52,423
- Must you upset me too?
- Mom.

989
00:53:52,522 --> 00:53:55,093
- You stay, then. I'll leave.
- Don't hit him.

990
00:53:55,093 --> 00:53:56,763
Stay here on your own!

991
00:53:56,763 --> 00:53:59,493
You're no longer my son!

992
00:53:59,493 --> 00:54:01,763
- Darn you.
- Okay, Mom. We'll pack.

993
00:54:02,002 --> 00:54:04,102
- Don't hit Do Jun.
- My goodness.

994
00:54:04,102 --> 00:54:05,872
Get changed and pack your things.

995
00:54:05,872 --> 00:54:08,002
Hurry up and pack. And you, wear this!

996
00:54:12,872 --> 00:54:13,943
Hurry.

997
00:54:17,283 --> 00:54:18,352
Mom.

998
00:54:19,113 --> 00:54:21,383
I want to say goodbye to Grandpa Kim.

999
00:54:22,352 --> 00:54:25,493
I promised to play baduk
with him tomorrow.

1000
00:54:26,222 --> 00:54:28,892
He's not here.
You can say goodbye another time.

1001
00:54:29,162 --> 00:54:30,892
- Let's go.
- Mom.

1002
00:54:31,033 --> 00:54:33,033
Shouldn't we say goodbye to the others?

1003
00:54:33,033 --> 00:54:34,963
I already did.

1004
00:54:35,502 --> 00:54:37,533
No one's at home at the moment.

1005
00:54:37,533 --> 00:54:39,133
Let's get going.

1006
00:55:04,693 --> 00:55:06,193
It's snowing.

1007
00:55:06,763 --> 00:55:07,832
Goodness.

1008
00:55:08,733 --> 00:55:11,573
Let's go. We must keep going.

1009
00:55:15,372 --> 00:55:16,403
Come on.

1010
00:55:29,252 --> 00:55:30,252
Thanks.

1011
00:55:31,693 --> 00:55:32,722
Get in.

1012
00:55:46,202 --> 00:55:48,073
Mr. Kim. Wait.

1013
00:55:49,542 --> 00:55:51,372
Gong Ma Ri.

1014
00:55:51,912 --> 00:55:52,943
You caught me.

1015
00:55:53,713 --> 00:55:57,352
I told you not to skate out here.
I said it's dangerous.

1016
00:55:57,452 --> 00:55:59,283
You're not even wearing a helmet.

1017
00:56:00,582 --> 00:56:03,352
Will you let me skate if I wear a helmet?

1018
00:56:03,352 --> 00:56:05,693
No. Go back home.

1019
00:56:06,352 --> 00:56:07,792
Everyone at school skates in these.

1020
00:56:07,792 --> 00:56:09,323
Everyone at school skates in these.

1021
00:56:09,323 --> 00:56:10,763
Why can't I do the same thing?

1022
00:56:11,133 --> 00:56:13,662
Ma Ri, listen to your dad.

1023
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:15,602
Okay.

1024
00:56:15,602 --> 00:56:17,202
Dad loves me so much...

1025
00:56:17,202 --> 00:56:18,872
that he can be overprotective.

1026
00:56:19,673 --> 00:56:21,002
But I understand.

1027
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:23,912
All right. Go inside then, Ma Ri.

1028
00:56:23,912 --> 00:56:26,113
Mom and I are going to a funeral.

1029
00:56:26,113 --> 00:56:27,412
Okay. Just go.

1030
00:56:27,412 --> 00:56:28,743
Fine. I will.

1031
00:56:28,743 --> 00:56:31,682
All right. There you go.

1032
00:56:32,352 --> 00:56:33,783
- Go on in.
- Go in.

1033
00:56:33,783 --> 00:56:35,082
I'll see you later.

1034
00:57:45,852 --> 00:57:48,463
Sun Young's son is good-looking.

1035
00:57:51,292 --> 00:57:53,662
Yes. He turned out well.

1036
00:57:57,533 --> 00:58:00,472
We have our Ma Ri, so I don't need a son.

1037
00:58:01,743 --> 00:58:04,443
Our Ma Ri is worth more than a son.

1038
00:58:13,752 --> 00:58:16,423
Hello? Yes, Auntie.

1039
00:58:19,122 --> 00:58:21,162
What did you say?

1040
00:58:22,222 --> 00:58:24,033
You mean, my Ma Ri?

1041
00:58:25,593 --> 00:58:26,733
What about Ma Ri?

1042
00:58:28,033 --> 00:58:31,673
(Operating Center)

1043
00:58:50,423 --> 00:58:52,722
How can you be yawning at this moment?

1044
00:58:52,752 --> 00:58:54,792
What? Am I supposed to suppress a yawn?

1045
00:58:56,722 --> 00:58:59,432
Mom, I guess Ma Ri is seriously injured.

1046
00:58:59,892 --> 00:59:01,562
What is taking them so long?

1047
00:59:01,963 --> 00:59:03,633
What if Ma Ri dies?

1048
00:59:03,633 --> 00:59:05,633
What's wrong with you?

1049
00:59:05,633 --> 00:59:07,772
Shut that darn mouth of yours.

1050
00:59:11,912 --> 00:59:13,013
What about Ma Ri?

1051
00:59:14,113 --> 00:59:16,213
Thank you for all your trouble,
Doctor Lee.

1052
00:59:16,783 --> 00:59:17,952
How is Ma Ri?

1053
00:59:18,352 --> 00:59:19,783
The operation went well.

1054
00:59:21,582 --> 00:59:24,593
Fortunately, we've got over the hump.

1055
00:59:24,693 --> 00:59:27,693
But the injury was so serious...

1056
00:59:31,292 --> 00:59:32,432
Chairman Gong.

1057
00:59:32,662 --> 00:59:33,693
Yes.

1058
00:59:33,932 --> 00:59:35,162
Can we talk for a moment?

1059
00:59:38,733 --> 00:59:39,772
Sure.

1060
00:59:42,772 --> 00:59:43,843
Soo Yeon.

1061
00:59:54,522 --> 00:59:55,983
What's going on?

1062
00:59:56,383 --> 00:59:58,892
She's alive,
but is something wrong with her?

1063
00:59:59,193 --> 01:00:01,263
Why do they want to talk in private?

1064
01:00:02,263 --> 01:00:05,963
No, our Ma Ri will be fine.
I'm sure she will be okay.

1065
01:00:07,202 --> 01:00:09,062
Our Ma Ri will be all right.

(Gwangjin Inn)

1067
01:00:45,903 --> 01:00:47,033
Do Ra.

1068
01:00:48,042 --> 01:00:49,142
Do Ra.

1069
01:00:50,843 --> 01:00:53,412
Do Ra. Wake up.

1070
01:00:53,843 --> 01:00:55,283
- Wake up, Do Ra.
- Gosh.

1071
01:00:57,553 --> 01:00:58,613
Do Ra.

1072
01:00:59,983 --> 01:01:02,483
Get dressed. Okay?

1073
01:01:02,483 --> 01:01:03,883
Why?

1074
01:01:05,423 --> 01:01:06,792
Get dressed now.

1075
01:01:07,593 --> 01:01:09,122
Hurry and get dressed.

1076
01:01:12,432 --> 01:01:14,662
Mom, I don't want to do this.

1077
01:01:14,662 --> 01:01:15,733
You don't?

1078
01:01:16,202 --> 01:01:17,772
Did you just say no?

1079
01:01:17,772 --> 01:01:21,002
Mom, you promised
you wouldn't let me do this again.

1080
01:01:21,372 --> 01:01:23,042
Why are you so selfish?

1081
01:01:23,042 --> 01:01:25,272
We all are about to starve to death.

1082
01:01:25,772 --> 01:01:28,243
People do things they don't want to do.

1083
01:01:28,243 --> 01:01:30,812
Why? To support their family.

1084
01:01:32,412 --> 01:01:35,153
Fine. If you don't want to do this,

1085
01:01:35,153 --> 01:01:37,292
let's all dive into the Han River and die.

1086
01:01:37,292 --> 01:01:38,622
- Go.
- Mom.

1087
01:01:38,622 --> 01:01:41,062
- Let's go and die.
- Mom, no. Please.

1088
01:01:41,062 --> 01:01:42,662
Mom.

1089

<i>Saturday afternoon</i>

1090
01:01:53,733 --> 01:01:57,002
<i>Don't hesitate like that</i>

1091
01:01:57,002 --> 01:02:02,082
<i>Just dance with me</i>

1092
01:02:03,513 --> 01:02:05,682
<i>Today</i>

1093
01:02:06,452 --> 01:02:09,783
<i>I don't want to talk about tiring things</i>

1094
01:02:09,783 --> 01:02:13,493
<i>Let's dance</i>

1095
01:02:16,093 --> 01:02:19,263
<i>I'm busy for some reason on Monday</i>

1096
01:02:19,263 --> 01:02:21,932
<i>I'm swamped on Tuesday</i>

("I Love You a Million Times"

1098
01:02:47,562 --> 01:02:48,622
Dad.

1099
01:02:50,392 --> 01:02:51,463
Is that you, Dad?

1100
01:02:54,963 --> 01:02:56,033
Dad.

1101
01:02:56,763 --> 01:02:58,332
It's you, Dad.

1102
01:02:59,533 --> 01:03:01,403
What are you doing here, Dad?

1103
01:03:05,343 --> 01:03:07,243
What is this bike for?

1104
01:03:08,182 --> 01:03:10,443
What's all this, Dad?

1105
01:03:10,443 --> 01:03:12,682
You just almost got killed.

1106
01:03:14,013 --> 01:03:16,883
(Judge)

1107
01:03:21,763 --> 01:03:22,763
What?

1108
01:03:23,522 --> 01:03:26,633
My Do Ra got the part?

1109
01:03:26,633 --> 01:03:27,702
My goodness.

1110
01:03:28,633 --> 01:03:31,173
Thank you so much, director.

1111
01:03:31,502 --> 01:03:32,972
Yes. Of course.

1112
01:03:34,303 --> 01:03:36,843
Mom, did I really get the part?

1113
01:03:36,843 --> 01:03:40,743
Yes, you got it. Do Ra, you made it!

1114
01:03:43,443 --> 01:03:46,483
You are the daughter of the lead role
in the 50-episode weekend TV drama.

1115
01:03:46,483 --> 01:03:49,153
With your pay,
we can find a small place to live.

1116
01:03:49,522 --> 01:03:51,423
You did a great job.

1117
01:03:51,423 --> 01:03:54,423
Mom, I'll make a lot of money
so I can buy you a house...

1118
01:03:54,423 --> 01:03:56,763
and buy Do Sik and Do Jun delicious foods.

1119
01:03:57,162 --> 01:03:59,193
So, Mom, I don't want you to cry anymore.

1120
01:03:59,463 --> 01:04:01,533
Thank you, Do Ra.

1121
01:04:01,533 --> 01:04:04,372
We'll be fine now.

1122
01:04:04,633 --> 01:04:05,702
It will be all right.

1123
01:04:15,743 --> 01:04:19,082
It will make Dae Chung happy
to know that I got the part.

1124
01:04:26,852 --> 01:04:28,423
Hello, Ms. Kim.

1125
01:04:30,662 --> 01:04:32,662
How dare you come here?

1126
01:04:33,463 --> 01:04:35,062
What are you doing here?

1127
01:04:37,102 --> 01:04:40,272
I have something to tell Dae Chung.

1128
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:43,073
I passed an audition.

1129
01:04:43,073 --> 01:04:44,673
I wanted to tell him that.

1130
01:04:44,673 --> 01:04:45,673
Hey!

1131
01:04:46,173 --> 01:04:48,182
Why does my son need to know that?

1132
01:04:48,943 --> 01:04:50,443
I can't stand the sight of your family.

1133
01:04:50,443 --> 01:04:52,182
I don't even want to hear your voice.

1134
01:04:53,283 --> 01:04:56,323
So don't ever come near here again.

1135
01:04:57,153 --> 01:05:00,053
I deeply loathe your family.

1136
01:05:00,352 --> 01:05:01,392
Go away.

1137
01:05:01,392 --> 01:05:03,593
Leave. Don't ever come here again.

1138
01:05:04,832 --> 01:05:06,033
I'm sorry, Ms. Kim.

1139
01:05:06,033 --> 01:05:08,702
Just go! Go away!

1140
01:06:05,252 --> 01:06:10,522
(15 years later)

1141
01:06:18,432 --> 01:06:19,872
Dae Chung!

1142
01:06:19,972 --> 01:06:23,142
Wait. Ko Pil Seung, you forgot your phone.

1143
01:06:23,142 --> 01:06:24,372
Mom, throw it.

1144
01:06:24,372 --> 01:06:25,513
Okay, catch.

1145
01:06:26,743 --> 01:06:28,443
Nice catch. I'll get going!

1146
01:06:29,883 --> 01:06:31,812
Watch out for cars and women.

1147
01:06:33,113 --> 01:06:34,113
Gosh.

1148
01:06:34,682 --> 01:06:37,693
He got in at 4 a.m. and got 3 hours of
shut-eye only to head back to work again.

1149
01:06:38,252 --> 01:06:40,752
Why is he being called in
when he got a few days off?

1150
01:06:42,662 --> 01:06:44,022
What kind of a job is this demanding?

1151
01:06:44,562 --> 01:06:46,832
Is this how it is
for all broadcast directors?

1152
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:52,233
My son is still handsome
despite not getting any sleep.

1153
01:06:52,233 --> 01:06:53,272
You sweet thing.

1154
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:58,013
Sun Young, you're a lovesick puppy
when it comes to your son.

1155
01:06:58,843 --> 01:07:01,582
But when the love runs deep,
the betrayal will sting even more.

1156
01:07:01,582 --> 01:07:03,082
Gosh, my Dae Chung...

1157
01:07:03,082 --> 01:07:07,053
I mean, my Pil Seung will never betray me.

1158
01:07:19,533 --> 01:07:21,002
(My very own anti-aging regimen)

1159
01:07:25,332 --> 01:07:26,372
Do you see her?

1160
01:07:27,173 --> 01:07:29,243
- Seriously.
- Hey, check that out.

1161
01:07:29,943 --> 01:07:31,213
Park Do Ra rocked.

1162
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:32,642
Darn, she's stunning.

1163
01:07:33,142 --> 01:07:34,513
I'm buying that product.

1164
01:07:34,513 --> 01:07:36,613
How can Park Do Ra have such great skin?

1165
01:07:37,213 --> 01:07:38,252
What do you expect from celebrities?

1166
01:07:49,892 --> 01:07:52,133
(My very own anti-aging regimen)

1167
01:07:52,133 --> 01:07:54,602
(We thank Park Geun Hyung
for his guest appearance.)

1168
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:57,803
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1169
01:08:30,663 --> 01:08:33,003
You want me to work
on "Straightforward Romance" with Jin Gu?

1170
01:08:33,003 --> 01:08:35,602
I'm afraid I won't be available
for this project.

1171
01:08:35,602 --> 01:08:37,543
Who knew I'd run into Park Do Ra there?

1172
01:08:37,543 --> 01:08:38,812
She doesn't recognize me though.

1173
01:08:38,812 --> 01:08:40,172
I hear Park Do Ra is a money-grubber.

1174
01:08:40,172 --> 01:08:42,342
There are rumors about her
doing anything for the right price.

1175
01:08:42,342 --> 01:08:44,983
I value money over everything else.

1176
01:08:46,552 --> 01:08:48,722
The main investor will step away...

1177
01:08:48,882 --> 01:08:50,583
if Park Do Ra isn't the lead.

1178
01:08:50,583 --> 01:08:53,193
We'll have to scrap the project
unless we get her on board.

1179
01:08:54,193 --> 01:08:56,422
I'll make sure to get Park Do Ra on board!

1180
01:08:57,163 --> 01:08:59,693
Sir, please drive faster.

1181
01:08:59,863 --> 01:09:02,632
Do Ra, please. Where are you?

1182
01:09:04,062 --> 01:09:05,172
Park Do Ra!

1183
