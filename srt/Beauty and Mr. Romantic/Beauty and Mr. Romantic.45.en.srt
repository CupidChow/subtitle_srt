(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:08,534 --> 00:00:10,433
- Ms. Kim.
- Ms. Kim!

3
00:00:10,433 --> 00:00:12,404
- Ms. Kim.
- Ms. Kim.

4
00:00:12,564 --> 00:00:13,864
Ji Young.

5
00:00:14,203 --> 00:00:16,450
- Ji Young.
- Are you really Park Do Ra?

6
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:17,734
Did you undergo
major plastic surgery...

7
00:00:17,734 --> 00:00:19,044
to lie that you were Kim Ji Young?

8
00:00:19,044 --> 00:00:20,474
Did you deceive
Director Ko Pil Seung too?

9
00:00:20,474 --> 00:00:23,113
Does Director Ko Pil Seung also know
that you are Park Do Ra?

10
00:00:23,113 --> 00:00:24,813
- Say something.
- Any comment?

11
00:00:24,813 --> 00:00:25,813
A comment, please.

12
00:00:25,813 --> 00:00:28,313
Who do you think you are,
ganging up on her like this?

13
00:00:28,313 --> 00:00:29,714
I'll tell you everything.

14
00:00:29,714 --> 00:00:32,484
Everything will be explained
in a separate press conference,

15
00:00:32,484 --> 00:00:33,484
so please...

16
00:00:33,484 --> 00:00:34,994
Does it mean he knew everything
from the get-go?

17
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:36,523
Did you two deceive everyone
together?

18
00:00:36,523 --> 00:00:37,870
No.

19
00:00:37,894 --> 00:00:39,994
Director Ko didn't know.

20
00:00:39,994 --> 00:00:41,164
It was all me.

21
00:00:41,164 --> 00:00:42,763
The suicide
and everything that followed.

22
00:00:42,763 --> 00:00:45,564
Did you fake your own death
to get out of your debt?

23
00:00:45,564 --> 00:00:48,733
Did you have to get a new face
and still go into acting?

24
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:50,233
- Say something.
- Jae Dong!

25
00:00:50,233 --> 00:00:51,503
- Please explain.
- Any comments?

26
00:00:51,503 --> 00:00:52,644
- Please say something.
- Any comments?

27
00:00:52,644 --> 00:00:54,974
- Say something.
- Any comments?

28
00:00:55,774 --> 00:00:58,383
- Please say something.
- Tell us the truth.

29
00:00:58,844 --> 00:01:00,283
Any comments?

30
00:01:00,414 --> 00:01:02,654
Please tell us what's going on!

31
00:01:02,784 --> 00:01:05,483
What on earth just happened?

32
00:01:09,454 --> 00:01:10,954
- Over there.
- Check over there.

33
00:01:10,954 --> 00:01:12,423
Ms. Kim!

34
00:01:12,763 --> 00:01:14,093
Ms. Kim.

35
00:01:15,763 --> 00:01:17,193
They went that way.

36
00:01:18,164 --> 00:01:20,503
Wait. Aren't you Ms. Baek Mi Ja?

37
00:01:21,033 --> 00:01:22,909
You're Baek Mi Ja,
Park Do Ra's mother.

38
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:25,143
- Ms. Baek.
- Were you also aware of this?

39
00:01:25,274 --> 00:01:27,444
No, I don't know anything.

40
00:01:27,444 --> 00:01:28,543
I don't know anything.

41
00:01:28,543 --> 00:01:29,643
- Please comment.
- No.

42
00:01:29,643 --> 00:01:32,090
- Ms. Baek, please say something.
- Ms. Baek!

43
00:01:32,114 --> 00:01:33,813
- Ms. Baek?
- Ms. Baek, please comment.

44
00:01:33,813 --> 00:01:35,983
- Ms. Baek, wait.
- Please say something.

45
00:01:43,494 --> 00:01:45,964
(Park Do Ra Is Alive!
Did She Fake Her Death?)

46
00:01:46,324 --> 00:01:47,763

Is Former Top Star Park Do Ra!)

47

(Did Park Do Ra Fake Her Death
to Bury the Sponsorship Scandal?)

48
00:01:59,873 --> 00:02:03,414
My gosh. How's Sun Young doing?

49
00:02:04,244 --> 00:02:06,183
Goodness me.

50
00:02:06,183 --> 00:02:08,584
I still haven't been able
to calm myself.

51
00:02:08,584 --> 00:02:10,113
My hands are shaking.

52
00:02:10,584 --> 00:02:12,584
How could they have
even thought to marry...

53
00:02:12,584 --> 00:02:14,854
while deceiving us like that?

54
00:02:15,694 --> 00:02:19,393
Now you know why I berate him
for being a foundling.

55
00:02:19,393 --> 00:02:20,924
Mom, please.

56
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:24,834
What? It's not like I'm wrong.

57
00:02:25,703 --> 00:02:28,450
He wouldn't have done this
if you were his biological parents.

58
00:02:28,474 --> 00:02:31,010
Is this how he repays you
for raising him all these years?

59
00:02:31,034 --> 00:02:32,843
That darn brat.

60
00:02:32,974 --> 00:02:35,874
A marriage isn't just
for the bride and groom.

61
00:02:36,543 --> 00:02:39,644
How could something
like this happen?

62
00:02:40,143 --> 00:02:42,013
You can only imagine...

63
00:02:42,013 --> 00:02:44,184
how betrayed Chairman Gong
must be feeling.

64
00:02:44,724 --> 00:02:46,724
Even if he backs out
of the adoption deal,

65
00:02:46,724 --> 00:02:48,024
we'd have nothing to say.

66
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,654
Mom, please stop.

67
00:02:49,654 --> 00:02:52,494
Sun Young's heartbroken as is.

68
00:02:53,393 --> 00:02:56,670
Pil Seung had his reasons.

69
00:02:56,694 --> 00:02:58,434
As if!

70
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:02,434
Hold on. Did you know about this?

71
00:03:03,773 --> 00:03:05,404
Pil Seung told me...

72
00:03:05,874 --> 00:03:09,519
everything before the wedding.

73
00:03:09,543 --> 00:03:11,413
What? You...

74
00:03:11,613 --> 00:03:15,214
What... What was that?

75
00:03:16,184 --> 00:03:20,283
Are you saying you knew about this?

76
00:03:21,124 --> 00:03:23,954
You knew the truth
and still deceived us?

77
00:03:24,053 --> 00:03:27,823
Wait. Did you also know...

78
00:03:28,263 --> 00:03:30,533
that Kim Ji Young is
actually Park Do Ra?

79
00:03:30,694 --> 00:03:32,633
- You...
- I heard...

80
00:03:33,164 --> 00:03:36,649
about her story from Pil Seung
and felt terrible.

81
00:03:36,673 --> 00:03:39,443
That's why...

82
00:03:39,574 --> 00:03:42,189
I gave him my approval.

83
00:03:42,213 --> 00:03:44,513
- What?
- My goodness.

84
00:03:45,483 --> 00:03:46,783
How...

85
00:03:47,213 --> 00:03:50,454
How could you approve of this
after finding out about her?

86
00:03:50,553 --> 00:03:52,624
Are you out of your mind?

87
00:03:53,053 --> 00:03:56,624
Everyone is hurling stones
at Pil Seung.

88
00:03:56,754 --> 00:04:00,094
This is all your fault.

89
00:04:00,094 --> 00:04:02,094
What will you do to correct this?

90
00:04:02,094 --> 00:04:04,094
- How will you save our son?
- I...

91
00:04:04,094 --> 00:04:05,634
- What will you do?
- I'm sorry. I never thought...

92
00:04:05,634 --> 00:04:07,164
something like this would happen.

93
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,533
- Sun Young.
- You...

94
00:04:09,673 --> 00:04:13,380
How could you deceive me like this?

95
00:04:13,404 --> 00:04:15,414
I can't live with you anymore.

96
00:04:15,414 --> 00:04:18,043
- I want a divorce!
- Goodness.

97
00:04:18,043 --> 00:04:20,213
- Sun Young, please.
- I can't live with you anymore.

98
00:04:20,213 --> 00:04:23,384
- Sun Young, come on.
- I want a divorce!

99
00:04:23,384 --> 00:04:25,083
- How could you?
- Sun Young.

100
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,660
- How could you?
- Sun Young, calm down.

101
00:04:26,684 --> 00:04:29,424
(Shocking! Park Do Ra Is Alive!
She Faked Her Own Death!)

102
00:04:32,694 --> 00:04:34,094
My goodness.

103
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:36,263
My poor Do Ra.

104
00:04:37,064 --> 00:04:39,763
How did the reporters know
that Ji Young is Do Ra?

105
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:41,934
My poor Do Ra.

106
00:04:42,934 --> 00:04:44,603
She was finally making some money,

107
00:04:44,603 --> 00:04:46,573
and then this happened
out of nowhere.

108
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,374
Goodness me.

109
00:04:49,773 --> 00:04:51,614
Do Sik, my gosh.

110
00:04:57,153 --> 00:04:58,523
It was you, wasn't it?

111
00:04:59,453 --> 00:05:01,484
You did this. You...

112
00:05:01,653 --> 00:05:05,093
You told the reporters
who Ji Young really is.

113
00:05:05,093 --> 00:05:06,864
No!

114
00:05:07,263 --> 00:05:09,593
I'm upset as it is,
so why would you accuse me?

115
00:05:09,593 --> 00:05:11,364
Why would I rat out my daughter?

116
00:05:11,364 --> 00:05:13,203
You said so the other day...

117
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,434
that you'd tell the world
who she is.

118
00:05:16,973 --> 00:05:20,004
That was the anger talking.

119
00:05:20,004 --> 00:05:22,713
It was out of spite
since you were abandoning me.

120
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,484
Mom, for the last time,
I'll ask for your honesty.

121
00:05:25,484 --> 00:05:27,984
It was you.
No one else could've leaked this.

122
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,114
It wasn't me!

123
00:05:32,184 --> 00:05:33,484
But...

124
00:05:34,653 --> 00:05:36,724
to tell you the truth,

125
00:05:37,893 --> 00:05:40,864
I might've said something
I shouldn't have.

126
00:05:42,194 --> 00:05:44,094
You might have said something?

127
00:05:45,434 --> 00:05:46,864
That day...

128
00:05:47,703 --> 00:05:51,050
Mr. Gong came over and kept asking
if Ji Young was Do Ra.

129
00:05:51,074 --> 00:05:53,304
He said he heard us talking.

130
00:05:53,304 --> 00:05:57,449
I'd had a bit to drink that day.

131
00:05:57,473 --> 00:06:00,259
"My Do Ra isn't Ji Young."

132
00:06:00,283 --> 00:06:02,960
"Would I tell you
something like that?"

133
00:06:02,984 --> 00:06:06,554
I said that,
and I think that was a mistake.

134
00:06:06,953 --> 00:06:08,284
What?

135
00:06:08,853 --> 00:06:10,254
I can't prove it,

136
00:06:10,254 --> 00:06:12,869
but I think
it was Mr. Gong who did it.

137
00:06:12,893 --> 00:06:15,393
Do Sik, will you believe me?

138
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:18,579
Shall I go to Gong Jin Dan
and put him in his place?

139
00:06:18,603 --> 00:06:21,463
Shall I slap him or something?

140
00:06:22,804 --> 00:06:24,304
It was your fault, then.

141
00:06:24,304 --> 00:06:27,203
No one would've known
if you hadn't said anything, right?

142
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:32,544
Don't talk like that to me.
You're making me feel sad.

143
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:36,414
Don't show yourself
before us ever again.

144
00:06:36,713 --> 00:06:38,283
Even if Do Ra and Do Jun are okay
with it,

145
00:06:38,283 --> 00:06:39,784
I can't stand you.

146
00:06:40,023 --> 00:06:42,369
You can live here if you want.

147
00:06:42,393 --> 00:06:44,023
But if you appear
before Do Ra or Do Jun...

148
00:06:44,023 --> 00:06:45,939
and mention money again,

149
00:06:45,963 --> 00:06:47,624
I'll put this place up for rent.

150
00:06:47,694 --> 00:06:50,434
- No, Do Sik...
- Mom.

151
00:06:51,194 --> 00:06:53,234
This is the end.

152
00:06:54,403 --> 00:06:56,374
Let's never meet again.

153
00:06:57,903 --> 00:06:59,804
No, Do Sik, wait.

154
00:06:59,804 --> 00:07:03,189
It's not like that, Do Sik.

155
00:07:03,213 --> 00:07:05,489
That's not what happened. Do Sik.

156
00:07:05,513 --> 00:07:09,213
Do Sik! It wasn't on purpose!

157
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,614
Pil Seung.

158
00:07:45,653 --> 00:07:47,224
What should I do?

159
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:57,833
(Kim Ji Young Was Park Do Ra!
She Deceived the World!)

160
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,603

of Park Do Ra's Disguise!)

162

163
00:08:09,174 --> 00:08:11,244
(The nation's in shock
after learning "Seoul Lady" star...)

164
00:08:11,244 --> 00:08:13,444
(Kim Ji Young turned out
to be Park Do Ra.)

165
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,713
(Park Do Ra's Kim Ji Young?
I feel like I drank raw sewage.)

166
00:08:15,713 --> 00:08:17,583
(Isn't Ko Pil Seung just as bad?)

167
00:08:22,124 --> 00:08:23,523
Oh, no.

168
00:08:25,564 --> 00:08:26,963
What now?

169
00:08:39,273 --> 00:08:41,104
I told you not to read this stuff.

170
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,944
They don't know what happened.

171
00:08:46,044 --> 00:08:48,854
There's no context in the articles
and it's provoking the public.

172
00:08:49,383 --> 00:08:53,454
In time, they'll come to see
you didn't do this...

173
00:08:54,123 --> 00:08:55,523
on purpose.

174
00:08:57,623 --> 00:08:59,293
I'm okay.

175
00:09:01,493 --> 00:09:05,403
I deserve to be
cursed out and stoned.

176
00:09:05,904 --> 00:09:08,003
I can make no excuses.

177
00:09:10,003 --> 00:09:11,803
But what about you?

178
00:09:12,603 --> 00:09:15,474
Why should you go through this
because of me?

179
00:09:16,074 --> 00:09:19,513
This is why I said
I wouldn't marry you.

180
00:09:23,654 --> 00:09:25,013
Do Ra.

181
00:09:25,383 --> 00:09:27,124
I said I was okay.

182
00:09:29,123 --> 00:09:32,923
We knew we'd have to go through this
at least once.

183
00:09:33,993 --> 00:09:38,163
Let's just think it happened
sooner than we thought.

184
00:09:39,164 --> 00:09:41,564
The public's excited
and on edge right now.

185
00:09:41,633 --> 00:09:43,173
Let's take the time...

186
00:09:43,904 --> 00:09:45,673
to explain what happened.

187
00:09:46,843 --> 00:09:50,574
Then they'll see the truth about us.

188
00:09:54,144 --> 00:09:55,614
Let's get through...

189
00:09:56,883 --> 00:09:59,153
this wave together. Okay?

190
00:10:01,524 --> 00:10:03,694
Do you really think so?

191
00:10:06,694 --> 00:10:08,023
Do you?

192
00:10:11,493 --> 00:10:12,834
Yes.

193
00:10:13,764 --> 00:10:17,003
They'll see the truth one day.

194
00:10:24,914 --> 00:10:26,484
Stop crying.

195
00:10:28,483 --> 00:10:30,013
I'm by your side.

196
00:10:42,064 --> 00:10:43,633
(Park Faked Death and Changed Looks
to Escape Sponsor Scandal!)

197
00:10:43,633 --> 00:10:44,939
Yes.

198
00:10:44,963 --> 00:10:47,964
Justice prevailed.

199
00:10:48,973 --> 00:10:51,803
They should pay
for lying to the public.

200
00:10:52,304 --> 00:10:53,744
These two...

201
00:10:54,274 --> 00:10:56,714
will have to leave the country.

202
00:11:01,613 --> 00:11:03,013
Darn it.

203
00:11:03,654 --> 00:11:06,153
They should've listened to me.

204
00:11:08,824 --> 00:11:10,553
Jin Dan!

205
00:11:11,194 --> 00:11:12,864
I have some big news.

206
00:11:14,164 --> 00:11:16,494
Do you know who Kim Ji Young is?

207
00:11:17,164 --> 00:11:19,679
You kept saying
she looked like Do Ra.

208
00:11:19,703 --> 00:11:21,564
Well, she is Do Ra.

209
00:11:21,703 --> 00:11:24,533
She pretended to be dead,
but she was alive.

210
00:11:24,574 --> 00:11:28,120
Reporters raided the wedding hall
as she walked down the aisle.

211
00:11:28,144 --> 00:11:30,814
The people there
had never seen such a sight.

212
00:11:31,113 --> 00:11:34,160
Jin Dan. What would've happened
if you'd ended up with her?

213
00:11:34,184 --> 00:11:36,913
Our family and you
would've gone down.

214
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,383
Jin Dan. Why aren't you surprised?

215
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:44,224
Ji Young is the Do Ra
you missed so much.

216
00:11:44,493 --> 00:11:47,800
I read the news.
I know all about it.

217
00:11:47,824 --> 00:11:48,839
Do you?

218
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:52,234
Don't you think
Do Ra's a scary freak?

219
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,333
Oh, right.

220
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:56,780
I talked to Mr. Kang, the lawyer.
They've postponed...

221
00:11:56,804 --> 00:11:58,734
Pil Seung's adoption for now.

222
00:12:00,203 --> 00:12:01,780
- Is that true?
- Yes.

223
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:05,214
Your brother knows right from wrong.

224
00:12:05,243 --> 00:12:07,290
He figured it out
and put a stop to it.

225
00:12:07,314 --> 00:12:10,684
We would've taken a tumble
if he'd adopted Pil Seung,

226
00:12:10,684 --> 00:12:12,324
but he avoided that.

227
00:12:12,883 --> 00:12:15,123
I don't know who leaked this
to the press,

228
00:12:15,123 --> 00:12:16,500
but I'm glad they did.

229
00:12:16,524 --> 00:12:18,770
How could she lie
to everyone like that?

230
00:12:18,794 --> 00:12:20,439
She even got a new look.

231
00:12:20,463 --> 00:12:22,809
It gives me the chills.

232
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,564
She's a crazy freak. Seriously.

233
00:12:32,804 --> 00:12:35,543
Dad. It's me.

234
00:12:37,914 --> 00:12:40,883
Hey, Pil Seung.
Where are you? Are you okay?

235
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,053
Nothing bad happened to you?

236
00:12:45,324 --> 00:12:47,800
Are you sure you're okay?

237
00:12:47,824 --> 00:12:49,354
Have you eaten?

238
00:12:49,524 --> 00:12:52,024
How is she?
She seemed to be in shock.

239
00:12:52,024 --> 00:12:54,900
Are you out of your mind?
Who are you worried about?

240
00:12:54,924 --> 00:12:56,633
- Give me the phone.
- Okay.

241
00:12:56,633 --> 00:12:58,809
Don't worry about us here.

242
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,733
Call if something happens. Bye.

243
00:13:00,733 --> 00:13:04,834
Why did you hang up?
I asked you to put me on.

244
00:13:05,103 --> 00:13:07,819
- Goodness me.
- Pil Seung, that punk.

245
00:13:07,843 --> 00:13:11,314
He hasn't called me
or answered my calls.

246
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:14,420
When did you start colluding
with him?

247
00:13:14,444 --> 00:13:16,783
Why would you call that "colluding?"

248
00:13:17,113 --> 00:13:21,083
They're fine and in a safe place.
He says we don't have to worry.

249
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,469
He'll come home
once the frenzy dies down.

250
00:13:23,493 --> 00:13:24,493
That's all.

251
00:13:24,493 --> 00:13:26,794
You should've told him
to just come home.

252
00:13:26,794 --> 00:13:29,809
What if something happens to him
while he's out there?

253
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,880
Everyone's out there to get them.

254
00:13:32,904 --> 00:13:35,833
Sun Young. How can he come home
when there are...

255
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,174
- reporters waiting outside?
- Yes.

256
00:13:38,174 --> 00:13:40,974
How long must he be in hiding, then?

257
00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:43,643
What did he do to have to do this?

258
00:13:45,044 --> 00:13:47,589
This is all your fault.

259
00:13:47,613 --> 00:13:49,959
Why did you give permission?

260
00:13:49,983 --> 00:13:52,654
If you'd told me,
I'd have stopped him...

261
00:13:52,654 --> 00:13:55,024
and none of this would've happened!

262
00:13:55,024 --> 00:13:58,453
- Sun Young.
- Stop it. Sun Young.

263
00:13:58,453 --> 00:14:01,963
Why on earth is that
Hyun Chul's fault?

264
00:14:01,963 --> 00:14:04,734
It's Park Do Ra's fault.

265
00:14:04,764 --> 00:14:07,663
What should we do now?

266
00:14:07,963 --> 00:14:12,404
What should we do about Pil Seung?

267
00:14:12,404 --> 00:14:13,844
Sun Young.

268
00:14:14,074 --> 00:14:17,913
- Why you...
- Oh, the poor thing...

269
00:15:30,914 --> 00:15:32,314
Where did she go?

270
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,653
Do Ra.

271
00:15:39,824 --> 00:15:41,163
Ji Young!

272
00:15:42,633 --> 00:15:43,770
Ji Young!

273
00:15:43,794 --> 00:15:46,364
The person you have reached
is unavailable. Please leave...

274
00:15:49,174 --> 00:15:52,574
I'm sorry for making this decision
without telling you.

275
00:15:52,574 --> 00:15:56,114
But I thought it was only right
that I took care of this.

276
00:15:56,544 --> 00:15:58,273
I'm doing a press conference.

277
00:15:58,883 --> 00:16:02,114
Pil Seung,
I'll call you when it's over.

278
00:16:02,154 --> 00:16:03,353
Don't worry too much.

279
00:16:03,353 --> 00:16:04,683
A press conference?

280
00:16:06,623 --> 00:16:08,383
What is she saying?

281
00:16:17,463 --> 00:16:18,939
Chul Soo, it's me.

282
00:16:18,963 --> 00:16:21,003
Park Do Ra is holding
a press conference.

283
00:16:21,003 --> 00:16:23,204
Can you find out
where it's happening?

284
00:16:33,843 --> 00:16:35,214
First and foremost,

285
00:16:36,054 --> 00:16:39,783
I wish to apologize for stirring up
such a scandal.

286
00:17:04,144 --> 00:17:07,444
It may be a little too late,
but I thought...

287
00:17:07,684 --> 00:17:10,413
I should explain everything myself,

288
00:17:11,414 --> 00:17:12,859
which is why I'm here now.

289
00:17:12,883 --> 00:17:16,453
Ms. Kim, are you really Park Do Ra?

290
00:17:19,524 --> 00:17:20,824
Yes.

291
00:17:22,064 --> 00:17:23,564
I am Park Do Ra.

292
00:17:24,764 --> 00:17:26,163
It is true.

293
00:17:31,574 --> 00:17:34,044
But I can assure you
that the rumors...

294
00:17:34,774 --> 00:17:36,474
that I deliberately underwent
plastic surgery...

295
00:17:36,474 --> 00:17:38,143
and impersonated Kim Ji Young...

296
00:17:38,143 --> 00:17:39,583
to evade the sponsorship scandal...

297
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,284
and the breach
of contract penalties...

298
00:17:41,284 --> 00:17:42,730
aren't true.

299
00:17:42,754 --> 00:17:44,413
What do you mean?

300
00:17:44,484 --> 00:17:48,324
You did undergo plastic surgery
and lived as Kim Ji Young.

301
00:17:48,853 --> 00:17:50,624
I'll explain everything.

302
00:17:55,464 --> 00:17:57,133
It all began...

303
00:18:00,304 --> 00:18:02,163
because of...

304
00:18:02,774 --> 00:18:04,274
my mother's gambling debts.

305
00:18:08,343 --> 00:18:09,874
We're from the court.

306
00:18:10,514 --> 00:18:12,760
As of this moment,

307
00:18:12,784 --> 00:18:15,413
we will seize
Ms. Baek Mi Ja's assets.

308
00:18:15,413 --> 00:18:17,930
When I was working as Park Do Ra,

309
00:18:17,954 --> 00:18:21,223
I found out that my mom was deep
in gambling debts.

310
00:18:21,954 --> 00:18:25,369
This is an odd place to meet
for a commercial contract deal.

311
00:18:25,393 --> 00:18:27,723
I wanted to work hard
to pay off her debts.

312
00:18:30,163 --> 00:18:33,834
I thought I was attending a meeting
for a cosmetics ad,

313
00:18:34,264 --> 00:18:37,734
but people accused me
of trying to get a sponsor.

314
00:18:37,734 --> 00:18:40,774
Is this where we'll be discussing
the cosmetics ad campaign?

315
00:18:41,744 --> 00:18:43,074
Then...

316
00:18:43,544 --> 00:18:45,614
I became an actress
who had a sponsor.

317
00:18:49,183 --> 00:18:50,483
Ladies and gentlemen.

318
00:18:52,054 --> 00:18:54,153
I never had any sponsors.

319
00:18:55,853 --> 00:18:58,953
Ever since I made my acting debut
at the age of 13,

320
00:18:59,193 --> 00:19:01,399
I've been working hard
and diligently,

321
00:19:01,423 --> 00:19:03,393
and I've never done anything
I should be ashamed of.

322
00:19:04,564 --> 00:19:06,433
But because of the sponsor scandal,

323
00:19:06,433 --> 00:19:08,703
all my hard work
went down the drain,

324
00:19:09,403 --> 00:19:11,903
and no one believed me.

325
00:19:14,643 --> 00:19:17,074
Back then, I had no hope.

326
00:19:19,214 --> 00:19:22,114
I did everything I could to survive,

327
00:19:23,183 --> 00:19:26,084
but I felt like I was falling deeper
into a swamp the harder I tried.

328
00:19:28,784 --> 00:19:30,624
So, even though
I knew I shouldn't do it...

329
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:38,933
I went to the beach,
without even realizing it.

330
00:19:41,103 --> 00:19:43,703
Are you saying you didn't
deliberately fake your death?

331
00:19:46,903 --> 00:19:48,203
Correct.

332
00:19:49,044 --> 00:19:52,213
Back then, I really felt like
death was my only option.

333
00:19:53,413 --> 00:19:54,883
I really...

334
00:19:56,814 --> 00:20:00,653
don't think I can live
as Park Do Ra anymore, Dad.

335
00:20:02,853 --> 00:20:03,970
What?

336
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,824
I know you'll find it
hard to believe,

337
00:20:06,264 --> 00:20:08,223
but I jumped into the sea...

338
00:20:08,524 --> 00:20:10,593
- and woke up...
- Oh, dear.

339
00:20:10,593 --> 00:20:12,264
- in the hospital...
- What happened?

340
00:20:12,264 --> 00:20:14,304
as Kim Ji Young,
Ms. Lee Soon Jung's granddaughter.

341
00:20:15,264 --> 00:20:17,704
At the time,
I didn't remember anything,

342
00:20:17,704 --> 00:20:20,143
and I was diagnosed with amnesia.

343
00:20:21,603 --> 00:20:23,244
So I truly believed...

344
00:20:23,244 --> 00:20:26,183
I was Kim Ji Young,
Ms. Lee Soon Jung's granddaughter.

345
00:20:26,943 --> 00:20:29,854
Recently, I started regaining
my memories little by little...

346
00:20:31,514 --> 00:20:33,624
and discovered
that I was Park Do Ra.

347
00:20:35,254 --> 00:20:37,723
But I was already working
as an actress,

348
00:20:38,994 --> 00:20:41,423
so I debated countless times...

349
00:20:41,423 --> 00:20:43,564
whether or not I should tell
everyone I was Park Do Ra.

350
00:20:44,633 --> 00:20:47,133
But I didn't think
that anyone would believe me...

351
00:20:47,133 --> 00:20:49,733
until I proved
that I never had a sponsor.

352
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:54,244
So, I was planning
to clear my name first...

353
00:20:54,244 --> 00:20:56,443
and confidently confess everything,

354
00:20:56,873 --> 00:20:58,844
but this all came out first.

355
00:20:59,284 --> 00:21:00,319
Does that mean...

356
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:02,854
Director Ko deceived everyone
with you?

357
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:04,383
No, he didn't.

358
00:21:04,814 --> 00:21:06,453
He had no idea either.

359
00:21:06,653 --> 00:21:09,123
He only found out recently
that I was Park Do Ra.

360
00:21:09,123 --> 00:21:12,564
Either way, he married you
knowing you were Park Do Ra, right?

361
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:14,064
He knew you were Park Do Ra...

362
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:16,339
when he cast you for the role
in "Seoul Lady," didn't he?

363
00:21:16,363 --> 00:21:18,534
Well, he did.

364
00:21:19,093 --> 00:21:21,210
But he didn't make that decision
alone.

365
00:21:21,234 --> 00:21:23,409
Either way, he cast you for the role
knowing you were Park Do Ra.

366
00:21:23,433 --> 00:21:24,834
Reporters.

367
00:21:27,504 --> 00:21:29,574
Please, reporters. I beg you.

368
00:21:30,343 --> 00:21:33,243
Stop making groundless accusations
against Director Ko.

369
00:21:33,943 --> 00:21:35,954
Director Ko did nothing wrong.

370
00:21:35,954 --> 00:21:37,583
This is all my fault.

371
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:40,153
What do you mean
he did nothing wrong?

372
00:21:40,423 --> 00:21:42,893
You two orchestrated this together.
Who are you trying to kid?

373
00:21:42,893 --> 00:21:44,524
- Are you writing a novel now?
- What is this?

374
00:21:44,524 --> 00:21:46,193
You want to clear your name
when you had a sponsor?

375
00:21:46,193 --> 00:21:48,693
You got a new face and a new name.

376
00:21:48,693 --> 00:21:49,933
You've done nothing
to be ashamed of?

377
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,693
You're a fraud!

378
00:21:51,693 --> 00:21:55,034
If the sponsorship scandal
was just a groundless rumor,

379
00:21:55,034 --> 00:21:57,933
why did you totally change
your face?

380
00:21:58,004 --> 00:22:00,804
Why undergo plastic surgery
and live as someone else?

381
00:22:04,244 --> 00:22:05,714
- You're a fraud!
- Darn you.

382
00:22:05,714 --> 00:22:07,483
Stop!

383
00:22:11,214 --> 00:22:12,413
- You're a fraud!
- Liar!

384
00:22:12,413 --> 00:22:14,683
- This is ridiculous.
- Unbelievable.

385
00:22:14,724 --> 00:22:16,754
- Stop lying.
- Stop conning us.

386
00:22:16,754 --> 00:22:17,899
Do Ra!

387
00:22:17,923 --> 00:22:20,564
- Ko Pil Seung is here.
- Director Ko is here!

388
00:22:20,663 --> 00:22:21,824
- Director Ko is here.
- What?

389
00:22:21,824 --> 00:22:23,633
- Director Ko!
- Director Ko!

390
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:24,994
- Get him on camera!
- Director Ko Pil Seung!

391
00:22:24,994 --> 00:22:27,133
So, he was in on it too!

392
00:22:28,234 --> 00:22:30,833
- How dare you show up here?
- Darn you!

393
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,843
I bet you thought
you could fool everyone...

394
00:22:32,843 --> 00:22:34,004
at this press conference.

395
00:22:34,004 --> 00:22:36,544
Ko Pil Seung, you crook!

396
00:22:36,574 --> 00:22:38,643
Don't you think
you owe the other actors an apology?

397
00:22:38,943 --> 00:22:41,044
Director Ko did nothing wrong.

398
00:22:41,044 --> 00:22:42,343
You can yell at me all you want,

399
00:22:42,343 --> 00:22:44,113
but please don't do this
to Director Ko.

400
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:45,960
- Please!
- Let's go.

401
00:22:45,984 --> 00:22:48,083
Director Ko did nothing wrong!

402
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:49,123
Unbelievable.

403
00:22:49,123 --> 00:22:50,224
Guys.

404
00:22:50,224 --> 00:22:53,463
Park Do Ra's pathetic demise
is on full display now, live.

405
00:22:53,524 --> 00:22:56,433
Guys, don't lie.

406
00:22:56,633 --> 00:22:58,893
This is what happens when you lie.

407
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:15,726
Why did you do that
without even telling me? Why?

408
00:23:20,257 --> 00:23:21,627
See?

409
00:23:23,327 --> 00:23:26,137
I told you that you'd only suffer
if you stayed by my side.

410
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,706
Why did you have to be so stubborn?

411
00:23:30,706 --> 00:23:32,337
Look at yourself now.

412
00:23:32,676 --> 00:23:35,706
What is this? Because of me,
you've ended up in this mess too!

413
00:23:39,476 --> 00:23:40,786
Do Ra.

414
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:43,587
I'm okay, all right?

415
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:45,557
Pil Seung.

416
00:23:47,287 --> 00:23:49,387
I'm not okay.

417
00:23:50,926 --> 00:23:54,026
I really want to clear up
the misunderstanding about you.

418
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,936
You did nothing wrong.

419
00:23:58,337 --> 00:24:02,607
Why do you have to put up with this
when you did nothing wrong?

420
00:24:03,107 --> 00:24:06,506
I'm so upset
that I'm about to lose my mind!

421
00:24:08,307 --> 00:24:09,647
Do Ra.

422
00:24:10,946 --> 00:24:12,917
I said I was fine.

423
00:24:13,146 --> 00:24:14,647
So, why are you being like this?

424
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:17,656
What breaks my heart more
is the fact...

425
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,256
that you were sitting there alone.

426
00:24:20,587 --> 00:24:22,786
You must've been so scared,
all by yourself.

427
00:24:27,896 --> 00:24:29,226
Pil Seung.

428
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,236
Pil Seung,

429
00:24:31,497 --> 00:24:35,607
what will we do
if Hwang Jeong Sik never shows up?

430
00:24:36,367 --> 00:24:38,476
We'll never get out of this mess...

431
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:41,006
if we don't find him.

432
00:24:44,146 --> 00:24:46,793
It's not too late
for you to leave me.

433
00:24:46,817 --> 00:24:49,263
Just leave me!

434
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:52,817
Leave me and stay away, Pil Seung.

435
00:24:52,986 --> 00:24:54,327
Park Do Ra!

436
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:59,097
Pil Seung, cut your losses.

437
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:00,797
Do Ra.

438
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,527
Get a grip on yourself.

439
00:25:03,527 --> 00:25:05,397
Pil Seung, leave me.

440
00:25:05,466 --> 00:25:07,097
Stop saying that.

441
00:25:07,936 --> 00:25:11,637
Together, we can rise above this.

442
00:25:11,976 --> 00:25:14,882
Seeing you get criticized
by people...

443
00:25:14,906 --> 00:25:18,147
is worse than having my life
turned upside down.

444
00:25:19,176 --> 00:25:23,417
I'd rather die
than watch people condemn you.

445
00:25:27,827 --> 00:25:29,226
Do Ra.

446
00:25:29,557 --> 00:25:31,797
Calm down.

447
00:25:33,196 --> 00:25:34,497
I'll be fine as long as I have you.

448
00:25:34,497 --> 00:25:37,097
Pil Seung, what are we going to do?

449
00:25:37,497 --> 00:25:38,867
Have faith in me.

450
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:41,483
What are we going to do?

451
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:43,852
Pil Seung, what are we going to do?

452
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,206
It's all right.

453
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:47,446
It'll be all right.

454
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:53,917
What?

455
00:25:55,146 --> 00:25:57,692
You put a pause
on Pil Seung's adoption process?

456
00:25:57,716 --> 00:25:59,117
Honey.

457
00:26:00,857 --> 00:26:03,226
What other choice do I have
at this point?

458
00:26:03,456 --> 00:26:06,597
I'm actually relieved the court
hasn't started processing it.

459
00:26:06,956 --> 00:26:08,897
What if he were already
our adopted son?

460
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:12,667
The scandal would've eaten
APP Group up alive as well.

461
00:26:12,767 --> 00:26:14,137
Honey,

462
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:17,637
how could you stop the process
without discussing it with me?

463
00:26:18,936 --> 00:26:20,277
You were the one...

464
00:26:20,277 --> 00:26:23,246
who insisted on adopting him
as your son in the first place.

465
00:26:24,277 --> 00:26:26,847
You said he was like your son.

466
00:26:27,317 --> 00:26:29,547
When your children are in a crisis,

467
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:32,256
it's up to the parents to help them.

468
00:26:32,587 --> 00:26:35,026
How could you turn your back
on him...

469
00:26:35,757 --> 00:26:37,597
over this matter?

470
00:26:38,327 --> 00:26:39,926
You're calling it a pause,

471
00:26:40,527 --> 00:26:44,936
but you've already decided
to pull the plug, haven't you?

472
00:26:47,537 --> 00:26:48,867
Dad.

473
00:26:49,436 --> 00:26:52,783
Aren't you going to adopt Pil Seung?

474
00:26:52,807 --> 00:26:56,152
How can you turn your back on him
when he needs our support?

475
00:26:56,176 --> 00:26:58,716
Pil Seung agreed
to be your adopted son,

476
00:26:58,716 --> 00:27:00,593
which means you should help him.

477
00:27:00,617 --> 00:27:03,047
Ma Ri, my hands are tied.

478
00:27:03,047 --> 00:27:05,216
This was the choice he made.

479
00:27:05,317 --> 00:27:07,602
I told him not to marry her...

480
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,757
if he wanted to be my son,

481
00:27:09,757 --> 00:27:11,696
but he chose her instead.

482
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:13,503
I can't let that young lady...

483
00:27:13,527 --> 00:27:16,766
ruin the company's reputation.

484
00:27:19,297 --> 00:27:22,266
You'll probably choose the company
over me as well.

485
00:27:22,337 --> 00:27:23,567
I'm disappointed in you.

486
00:27:23,567 --> 00:27:25,436
Ma Ri, wait.

487
00:27:28,007 --> 00:27:31,117
Honey, don't just sit there
and go after her.

488
00:27:44,097 --> 00:27:45,397
What?

489
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,202
Jin Dan had feelings for Park Do Ra?

490
00:27:48,226 --> 00:27:49,543
Exactly.

491
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:53,567
They almost got engaged
back in the day.

492
00:27:53,966 --> 00:27:57,112
Back then and even now,
she was and still is a vixen.

493
00:27:57,136 --> 00:27:59,936
How could she lie about her identity
and take up acting again?

494
00:27:59,936 --> 00:28:03,176
My goodness.
Our Jin Dan must've been shaken.

495
00:28:04,017 --> 00:28:07,246
But isn't Park Do Ra
dating Pil Seung?

496
00:28:07,347 --> 00:28:09,986
Yes, and Jin Dan was
barking up the wrong tree.

497
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:11,956
My poor baby.

498
00:28:12,517 --> 00:28:13,617
He got duped by Do Ra...

499
00:28:13,617 --> 00:28:15,526
and then again
when she was Kim Ji Young.

500
00:28:16,357 --> 00:28:18,627
But I'm sure he had his reasons.

501
00:28:18,956 --> 00:28:21,372
Park Do Ra must've sent him
signals...

502
00:28:21,396 --> 00:28:23,973
while she was dating Pil Seung.

503
00:28:23,997 --> 00:28:25,837
Of course, she did.

504
00:28:26,396 --> 00:28:29,137
She's a cunning minx.

505
00:28:29,337 --> 00:28:32,577
Anyway, this ordeal
turned out to be a blessing.

506
00:28:32,876 --> 00:28:35,253
A blessing? How so?

507
00:28:35,277 --> 00:28:38,852
Chairman Gong was so disappointed
in Pil Seung...

508
00:28:38,876 --> 00:28:40,547
that he put the adoption on hold.

509
00:28:40,716 --> 00:28:41,787
That's what he says,

510
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:43,122
but we all know
he's pulling the plug.

511
00:28:43,146 --> 00:28:44,486
Really?

512
00:28:44,617 --> 00:28:46,733
Will Jin Dan be adopted
instead then?

513
00:28:46,757 --> 00:28:48,327
Not right now,

514
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:51,526
but I'll push Chairman Gong
in that direction when it's time.

515
00:28:51,726 --> 00:28:54,043
Besides, if no one gets adopted,

516
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:56,297
Jin Dan will inherit everything.

517
00:28:56,926 --> 00:29:00,297
That's why I need Pil Seung
to tank his life for good.

518
00:29:00,466 --> 00:29:03,206
Then Chairman Gong
will lose faith in him.

519
00:29:03,567 --> 00:29:06,352
That's why he needs to be
with Park Do Ra.

520
00:29:06,376 --> 00:29:08,446
Staying together will be his demise.

521
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:12,516
Yes, you're right.

522
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:26,726
He should've been out by now.

523
00:29:29,297 --> 00:29:32,043
- Where? I see.
- Over here.

524
00:29:32,067 --> 00:29:34,182
Why is nobody coming out?

525
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:37,182
That's why I need Pil Seung
to tank his life for good.

526
00:29:37,206 --> 00:29:39,976
Then Chairman Gong
will lose faith in him.

527
00:29:41,107 --> 00:29:43,622
I see you're working hard
in this hot weather.

528
00:29:43,646 --> 00:29:45,476
Here you go.

529
00:29:46,347 --> 00:29:47,886
Take these fans...

530
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:50,186
and have some beverages
while you wait.

531
00:29:50,547 --> 00:29:52,033
Thank you for this.

532
00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:53,986
But who may you be?

533
00:29:54,087 --> 00:29:57,132
I live at this residence.

534
00:29:57,156 --> 00:29:59,827
- Really?
- Are you Director Ko's family?

535
00:29:59,827 --> 00:30:01,196
Not exactly.

536
00:30:01,196 --> 00:30:04,142
I'm an acquaintance of his father's.

537
00:30:04,166 --> 00:30:06,036
You're an acquaintance.

538
00:30:06,136 --> 00:30:08,766
Since you know the family,
I'll ask some questions.

539
00:30:09,166 --> 00:30:10,882
During the press conference,

540
00:30:10,906 --> 00:30:12,476
Park Do Ra said...

541
00:30:12,476 --> 00:30:14,253
that Director Ko didn't know
she was Park Do Ra.

542
00:30:14,277 --> 00:30:15,577
Is that true?

543
00:30:16,007 --> 00:30:17,323
I'm not sure.

544
00:30:17,347 --> 00:30:20,323
I hear they've been dating
for a while now.

545
00:30:20,347 --> 00:30:22,192
It seems odd to think
that he didn't know.

546
00:30:22,216 --> 00:30:24,486
My guess is that he always knew.

547
00:30:24,517 --> 00:30:27,726
Could Director Ko have cast her
for his show...

548
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:29,186
just because of who she is?

549
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,696
She's his girlfriend, so yes.

550
00:30:31,926 --> 00:30:33,702
Working on set would be like a date.

551
00:30:33,726 --> 00:30:36,996
It's a win-win situation,
so why wouldn't he have cast her?

552
00:30:38,936 --> 00:30:41,412
Has Park Do Ra been by this house?

553
00:30:41,436 --> 00:30:42,867
Have you seen her here?

554
00:30:43,406 --> 00:30:46,506
I think I did see her
a couple of times,

555
00:30:46,736 --> 00:30:49,706
but I can't be sure that it was her.

556
00:30:50,176 --> 00:30:52,647
Many women have been by.

557
00:30:53,646 --> 00:30:55,147
What do you mean by that?

558
00:30:55,617 --> 00:30:57,932
Are you saying
Director Ko had other women?

559
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:01,726
It doesn't feel right to talk about
someone else's love life,

560
00:31:01,986 --> 00:31:03,786
so I won't comment on that.

561
00:31:04,597 --> 00:31:05,996
Jin Sang Gu!

562
00:31:06,396 --> 00:31:08,303
Jin Sang Gu, you punk.
What do you think you're doing?

563
00:31:08,327 --> 00:31:09,797
- You punk...
- What's going on?

564
00:31:09,797 --> 00:31:12,573
What he said is all lies.

565
00:31:12,597 --> 00:31:13,896
- He has nothing to do...
- You!

566
00:31:13,896 --> 00:31:15,442
- with our family.
- Sorry?

567
00:31:15,466 --> 00:31:18,013
He's only a tenant here.

568
00:31:18,037 --> 00:31:20,783
- What?
- Stop camping out here and leave.

569
00:31:20,807 --> 00:31:22,906
- Jin Sang Gu, you.
- Leave!

570
00:31:22,906 --> 00:31:25,892
- Get lost!
- My goodness.

571
00:31:25,916 --> 00:31:28,692
- What's her problem?
- Get lost!

572
00:31:28,716 --> 00:31:30,786
Leave!

573
00:31:30,986 --> 00:31:32,286
Goodness.

574
00:31:34,587 --> 00:31:37,857
The skies helped us
this time around.

575
00:31:38,726 --> 00:31:40,996
It's a relief...

576
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:43,926
that this all happened
before the adoption was processed.

577
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:47,496
We dodged a bullet on that one.

578
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:51,337
Jin Taek, I know...

579
00:31:51,337 --> 00:31:53,676
you want to adopt Pil Seung
for Ma Ri's sake.

580
00:31:54,007 --> 00:31:57,176
But Jin Dan is her family.

581
00:31:58,317 --> 00:32:00,547
He is the one to protect her,

582
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:03,962
this family, and APP Group.

583
00:32:03,986 --> 00:32:05,516
Only Jin Dan can do that.

584
00:32:06,787 --> 00:32:08,786
Mark my words.

585
00:32:10,087 --> 00:32:11,926
Auntie said that to Jin Taek?

586
00:32:12,656 --> 00:32:14,127
What was his response?

587
00:32:14,267 --> 00:32:16,327
He kept quiet and listened.

588
00:32:16,696 --> 00:32:20,797
But you know what it means
for him to keep quiet and listen.

589
00:32:21,136 --> 00:32:24,206
He let her talk
because he knew she had a point.

590
00:32:24,537 --> 00:32:25,882
Jin Dan,

591
00:32:25,906 --> 00:32:29,047
Pil Seung and Park Do Ra
saved your life big time.

592
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:32,192
From here on out, make sure...

593
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:35,186
you're never in the doghouse
with your aunt or brother.

594
00:32:46,327 --> 00:32:48,297
(Actress Kim Ji Young Says
"I'm Park Do Ra")

595
00:32:48,297 --> 00:32:50,936
(Park Do Ra Screams With Urgency,
"Ko Pil Seung Didn't Know")

596
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:57,706
(They're both so full of it.)

597
00:32:57,706 --> 00:32:59,077
(Ko Pil Seung's even worse.)

598
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:00,706
(As if you can lie your way
out of this.)

599
00:33:10,817 --> 00:33:12,587
I told you not to read
news articles...

600
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:15,127
or online comments.

601
00:33:16,287 --> 00:33:17,657
Don't read them.

602
00:33:17,956 --> 00:33:19,756
Have some water instead.

603
00:33:34,376 --> 00:33:36,006
Hey, Do Jun.

604
00:33:38,146 --> 00:33:40,917
What? Grandma?

605
00:33:45,087 --> 00:33:48,157
Got it. I'll be right there.

606
00:33:51,857 --> 00:33:53,357
What is it?

607
00:33:54,597 --> 00:33:56,797
I need to head home, Pil Seung.

608
00:33:58,067 --> 00:34:01,367
Grandma won't eat anything
and has been asking for me nonstop.

609
00:34:01,367 --> 00:34:03,006
She's close to passing out.

610
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:06,807
I can't allow that to happen.

611
00:34:09,807 --> 00:34:11,317
Sure, let's go.

612
00:34:11,876 --> 00:34:13,776
We can't avoid
the matter anymore anyway.

613
00:34:17,957 --> 00:34:19,763
What can I do without any patronage?

614
00:34:19,787 --> 00:34:22,927
What am I supposed to film
when no one's showing up?

615
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:31,566
Gosh, that's pretty.

616
00:34:31,566 --> 00:34:32,897
- Right.
- Wasn't it nice?

617
00:34:32,897 --> 00:34:34,437
- Of course.
- I think it came out well.

618
00:34:34,437 --> 00:34:37,037
Hey! That's Park Do Ra.

619
00:34:37,037 --> 00:34:38,577
- Over there.
- Isn't that her?

620
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:39,877
- Park Do Ra.
- You minx!

621
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:41,446
- I can't believe you.
- Park Do Ra!

622
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,577
- Ms. Park, say something.
- You're unbelievable.

623
00:34:43,577 --> 00:34:46,316
How could you deceive everyone?

624
00:34:46,316 --> 00:34:48,386
- Ms. Park, show us your face.
- Unbelievable.

625
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:50,417
- Ms. Park, show us your face.
- Move out of this neighborhood.

626
00:34:50,417 --> 00:34:52,917
- Get lost!
- Over here, Ms. Park.

627
00:34:52,917 --> 00:34:55,857
- Ms. Park, hold on.
- Unbelievable.

628
00:34:56,256 --> 00:34:58,656
Ji Young!

629
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,567
My goodness, my Ji Young.

630
00:35:01,727 --> 00:35:03,027
Grandma.

631
00:35:03,196 --> 00:35:04,567
My gosh.

632
00:35:04,867 --> 00:35:08,567
Where were you?

633
00:35:08,836 --> 00:35:12,177
I thought you had fallen
into the sea again.

634
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:16,347
Gosh, no. Why would I be in the sea?

635
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:18,053
That won't ever happen,

636
00:35:18,077 --> 00:35:19,877
so, don't worry about me, Grandma.

637
00:35:19,877 --> 00:35:22,886
Ji Young, my gosh.

638
00:35:28,057 --> 00:35:29,726
Grandma, I'm sorry.

639
00:35:31,557 --> 00:35:33,373
I'm sorry, Grandma.

640
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:36,566
No, don't say that.

641
00:35:36,566 --> 00:35:40,197
It's fine
since you came back to me alive.

642
00:35:40,437 --> 00:35:42,937
You will get to live.

643
00:35:42,937 --> 00:35:46,576
Ji Young, don't you worry.

644
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:50,177
Grandma.

645
00:35:51,977 --> 00:35:54,746
There you go.

646
00:35:54,917 --> 00:35:58,116
Goodness, it's all right.

647
00:35:58,256 --> 00:36:02,627
It's all right.

648
00:36:05,227 --> 00:36:06,356
Grandma...

649
00:36:06,356 --> 00:36:08,527
My sweet puppy.

650
00:36:12,296 --> 00:36:13,296
If I had known,

651
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,306
I would've stopped you
from marrying her.

652
00:36:16,167 --> 00:36:19,076
I'm sorry you got dragged
into all this.

653
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:23,377
Don't be ridiculous.

654
00:36:24,247 --> 00:36:25,817
Besides,

655
00:36:26,216 --> 00:36:28,487
this was something
we would have to deal with.

656
00:36:29,046 --> 00:36:31,147
That's why I rushed the wedding.

657
00:36:31,256 --> 00:36:33,116
To stay by Do Ra...

658
00:36:33,716 --> 00:36:35,456
in case the scandal broke.

659
00:36:36,886 --> 00:36:38,197
Pil Seung...

660
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:44,096
Others may be clueless,
but we know the truth.

661
00:36:44,796 --> 00:36:46,967
We know the sponsorship scandal
was a trap.

662
00:36:47,636 --> 00:36:50,466
The truth will be revealed someday,

663
00:36:50,466 --> 00:36:53,877
so let's stay strong
until that day comes.

664
00:36:57,046 --> 00:37:00,277
Pil Seung, I'll find
that Hwang Jeong Sik guy.

665
00:37:00,917 --> 00:37:02,816
Where in the Philippines
could you find him...

666
00:37:02,816 --> 00:37:05,817
when there are over 7,000 islands?

667
00:37:06,256 --> 00:37:08,127
I've been working
with a reporter friend...

668
00:37:08,127 --> 00:37:11,127
to track him down
by asking Koreans who live there.

669
00:37:11,127 --> 00:37:14,326
Recently, someone saw him.

670
00:37:14,696 --> 00:37:17,027
He's been living under an alias.

671
00:37:17,097 --> 00:37:18,797
Why wasn't he caught?

672
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:22,366
There's no evidence,
and he's not a criminal.

673
00:37:23,006 --> 00:37:25,677
But Hwang Jeong Sik has run out
of money...

674
00:37:25,906 --> 00:37:27,413
and wants to come back to Korea.

675
00:37:27,437 --> 00:37:28,806
Really?

676
00:37:29,307 --> 00:37:31,677
By the looks of it, he won't be able
to hold out for long.

677
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:33,617
Once he's back in Korea,

678
00:37:33,617 --> 00:37:35,386
the truth can be revealed.

679
00:37:35,546 --> 00:37:37,447
We'll get to know
who hired him for the job.

680
00:37:39,086 --> 00:37:41,116
Once Do Ra clears her name
in that scandal,

681
00:37:41,756 --> 00:37:44,326
people will be
more understanding of her.

682
00:37:46,327 --> 00:37:48,167
Pil Seung, thank you so much.

683
00:37:49,397 --> 00:37:50,766
Hold on.

684
00:37:52,836 --> 00:37:54,266
Yes, Director Yoon.

685
00:37:58,937 --> 00:38:00,237
Is that so?

686
00:38:01,307 --> 00:38:04,007
Sure. I'll be right there.

687
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:11,556
Do Ra, something came up,
and they need me at the office.

688
00:38:11,687 --> 00:38:13,386
I'll be right back
after handling that,

689
00:38:13,386 --> 00:38:14,902
so stay put.

690
00:38:14,926 --> 00:38:17,356
Do Sik, Do Jun, take care of Do Ra.

691
00:38:17,356 --> 00:38:19,056
- Sure.
- Sure, don't worry.

692
00:38:19,227 --> 00:38:22,127
But the reporters
must still be camped outside.

693
00:38:23,597 --> 00:38:26,837
Don't worry about me
and rest beside your grandma.

694
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:28,237
I'll be right back.

695
00:38:37,954 --> 00:38:39,254
Mr. Ko.

696
00:38:39,896 --> 00:38:41,117
Mr. Ko.

697
00:38:41,141 --> 00:38:44,780
The series by Writer Kim Min Ah
we were going to film.

698
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,350
We got the call
that it was canceled.

699
00:38:50,391 --> 00:38:52,050
I see.

700
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,091
Those who wanted to invest
have already backed out,

701
00:38:56,431 --> 00:38:58,360
and the existing investors...

702
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,901
are demanding reimbursement
and compensation.

703
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,930
The contracts for "Seoul Lady"
to air overseas...

704
00:39:04,431 --> 00:39:06,140
have also been terminated.

705
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:09,470
Those that have already paid us...

706
00:39:09,741 --> 00:39:12,070
will sue us
for breach of contract penalties.

707
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:19,155
(CEO Ko Pil Seung)

708
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,671
Yes, Chairman Gong.

709
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:46,937
(Letter of Resignation)

710
00:39:46,961 --> 00:39:49,961
(Chairman Gong Jin Taek)

711
00:39:55,072 --> 00:39:56,442
Is this...

712
00:39:57,142 --> 00:39:58,772
your solution?

713
00:40:02,811 --> 00:40:04,281
I'm not trying...

714
00:40:05,711 --> 00:40:08,611
to avoid the matter by resigning.

715
00:40:10,581 --> 00:40:13,051
However, I'm to blame...

716
00:40:13,191 --> 00:40:15,051
for the scandal just as much.

717
00:40:16,492 --> 00:40:18,562
It seems like I must leave
GOGO Entertainment...

718
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:22,162
to prevent the company
from any more losses.

719
00:40:23,831 --> 00:40:26,131
That is why
this is my first course of action.

720
00:40:28,702 --> 00:40:30,747
For the damage
I have already caused,

721
00:40:30,771 --> 00:40:34,611
I will do my best
to make up for it one by one.

722
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:39,451
I'm truly sorry, sir.

723
00:40:52,662 --> 00:40:55,332
Pil Seung handed you
his letter of resignation?

724
00:40:55,532 --> 00:40:58,732
Yes, he thought he had to resign
from GOGO Entertainment...

725
00:40:59,132 --> 00:41:01,531
to stop people
from attacking the company...

726
00:41:01,932 --> 00:41:05,801
and to prevent us
from further damage.

727
00:41:07,012 --> 00:41:09,881
How could you have accepted
his resignation?

728
00:41:10,412 --> 00:41:13,957
You know how much he has achieved
as the in-house director.

729
00:41:13,981 --> 00:41:17,051
He made GOGO Entertainment
what it is today,

730
00:41:17,682 --> 00:41:20,752
but he's also the reason
why it's now close to shutting down.

731
00:41:21,921 --> 00:41:24,662
He should take responsibility
for that as the CEO.

732
00:41:25,121 --> 00:41:27,491
The other employees
shouldn't have to suffer.

733
00:41:27,862 --> 00:41:28,937
Honey.

734
00:41:28,961 --> 00:41:30,631
And look at what happened.

735
00:41:31,501 --> 00:41:33,702
The announcement
of his resignation...

736
00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:36,401
calmed the public down instantly,

737
00:41:36,901 --> 00:41:38,972
and those who were willing to sue...

738
00:41:38,972 --> 00:41:41,442
are now abandoning the idea.

739
00:41:42,142 --> 00:41:46,151
From the company's perspective,
it sure is a relief.

740
00:41:46,751 --> 00:41:50,921
That is why
CEO Ko quickly decided to step down.

741
00:41:51,751 --> 00:41:54,451
Anyway, just know that it's done.

742
00:42:01,032 --> 00:42:03,401
I can't sit by and do nothing.

743
00:42:11,501 --> 00:42:15,511
Pil Seung stepped down
from the CEO position?

744
00:42:16,811 --> 00:42:20,281
Soo Yeon, are you sure?

745
00:42:25,182 --> 00:42:26,651
All right.

746
00:42:29,262 --> 00:42:31,862
Sun Young, what do you mean by that?

747
00:42:31,862 --> 00:42:34,761
Did Pil Seung step down
from his CEO position?

748
00:42:36,001 --> 00:42:37,502
He must have.

749
00:42:38,001 --> 00:42:41,372
Public sentiment almost ruined
the production company.

750
00:42:42,541 --> 00:42:43,942
My goodness.

751
00:42:44,242 --> 00:42:46,712
Our poor Pil Seung.

752
00:42:47,912 --> 00:42:49,412
Everyone thinks...

753
00:42:50,182 --> 00:42:53,252
he lied about Park Do Ra.

754
00:42:53,811 --> 00:42:55,451
On top of that,

755
00:42:55,921 --> 00:42:59,368
he is now considered
an unethical film director...

756
00:42:59,392 --> 00:43:02,962
who cast his girlfriend
solely for personal reasons.

757
00:43:04,121 --> 00:43:05,121
My goodness.

758
00:43:05,121 --> 00:43:08,091
Being with the wrong woman
completely ruined him.

759
00:43:08,731 --> 00:43:11,801
Chairman Gong might also withdraw
his adoption offer.

760
00:43:12,771 --> 00:43:14,201
I'm home.

761
00:43:14,432 --> 00:43:17,542
- Hey.
- Pil Seung, my goodness.

762
00:43:19,242 --> 00:43:22,772
What on earth is this?

763
00:43:23,842 --> 00:43:25,841
Did you really...

764
00:43:26,052 --> 00:43:27,551
quit your job...

765
00:43:27,912 --> 00:43:30,022
as the CEO yourself?

766
00:43:32,452 --> 00:43:34,522
I got the company in trouble.

767
00:43:35,621 --> 00:43:37,122
I should do the responsible thing.

768
00:43:37,621 --> 00:43:39,491
Oh, come on.

769
00:43:39,762 --> 00:43:43,207
All this is happening
because you dated the wrong girl.

770
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:45,432
You quit as CEO
of that great company,

771
00:43:45,501 --> 00:43:47,108
your adoption was put on hold,

772
00:43:47,132 --> 00:43:50,218
and your successful career's
on the rocks.

773
00:43:50,242 --> 00:43:52,718
You lost everything
you worked so hard for!

774
00:43:52,742 --> 00:43:55,542
Why should you go through this
for Park Do Ra?

775
00:43:56,211 --> 00:43:57,511
My goodness.

776
00:43:58,581 --> 00:44:00,752
Pil Seung, you...

777
00:44:00,952 --> 00:44:03,122
You should break up with her.

778
00:44:03,222 --> 00:44:05,992
Then the chairman
will take you back.

779
00:44:05,992 --> 00:44:08,627
Park Do Ra's responsible
for all this,

780
00:44:08,651 --> 00:44:10,622
not you.

781
00:44:11,191 --> 00:44:12,568
Yes, Pil Seung.

782
00:44:12,592 --> 00:44:15,832
Break up with her now.
You still can.

783
00:44:16,061 --> 00:44:17,632
You didn't go through
with the wedding.

784
00:44:17,632 --> 00:44:19,361
It went wrong.

785
00:44:19,401 --> 00:44:22,147
Break up with her,
and all will be well.

786
00:44:22,171 --> 00:44:24,202
Please, Pil Seung.

787
00:44:24,202 --> 00:44:27,971
Leave her now while you still can.

788
00:44:29,382 --> 00:44:30,682
Mom.

789
00:44:32,412 --> 00:44:34,082
Should I ditch the woman I chose...

790
00:44:35,382 --> 00:44:37,381
so the chairman will adopt me?

791
00:44:39,052 --> 00:44:40,651
I can't do that.

792
00:44:42,351 --> 00:44:44,261
I quit my job,

793
00:44:44,921 --> 00:44:46,761
but I'll get back up.

794
00:44:47,461 --> 00:44:48,892
Don't worry.

795
00:44:51,862 --> 00:44:54,332
- My gosh.
- What a fool.

796
00:44:54,401 --> 00:44:55,901
Oh, dear.

797
00:44:56,171 --> 00:44:58,202
- My gosh...
- Sun Young.

798
00:44:58,202 --> 00:44:59,988
- Sun Young.
- Oh, dear.

799
00:45:00,012 --> 00:45:03,258
Don't cry again, Sun Young.
You could end up very ill.

800
00:45:03,282 --> 00:45:05,417
- That darn fool.
- Why, Mother...

801
00:45:05,441 --> 00:45:06,882
What an idiot.

802
00:45:06,882 --> 00:45:09,258
Stop it. You'll exhaust yourself.

803
00:45:09,282 --> 00:45:11,482
I'm so darn upset.

804
00:45:11,722 --> 00:45:13,091
Hyun Chul!

805
00:45:13,322 --> 00:45:16,461
- What should I do?
- Get over here.

806
00:45:16,461 --> 00:45:19,791
Stop crying, Sun Young.
You're exhausted.

807
00:45:19,791 --> 00:45:21,432
Stop it.

808
00:45:28,331 --> 00:45:30,571
You quit as CEO
of that great company,

809
00:45:30,702 --> 00:45:32,417
your adoption was put on hold,

810
00:45:32,441 --> 00:45:35,448
and your successful career's
on the rocks.

811
00:45:35,472 --> 00:45:37,957
You lost everything
you worked so hard for!

812
00:45:37,981 --> 00:45:40,812
Why should you go through this
for Do Ra?

813
00:45:46,722 --> 00:45:48,127
Honey, I got you...

814
00:45:48,151 --> 00:45:49,522
Where are you going?

815
00:46:04,441 --> 00:46:05,772
Mother.

816
00:46:05,972 --> 00:46:07,272
"Mother?"

817
00:46:08,112 --> 00:46:09,841
How dare you call me that?

818
00:46:10,981 --> 00:46:13,151
Pil Seung lost his CEO title,

819
00:46:13,151 --> 00:46:14,988
his adoption was canceled,

820
00:46:15,012 --> 00:46:17,781
and the whole world
thinks he's a con man.

821
00:46:17,851 --> 00:46:20,352
He lost everything because of you.

822
00:46:20,851 --> 00:46:23,462
He lost everything.

823
00:46:23,791 --> 00:46:26,738
What will you do about his life now?

824
00:46:26,762 --> 00:46:29,332
What will you do about him?

825
00:46:31,932 --> 00:46:33,232
You...

826
00:46:33,532 --> 00:46:35,472
Years ago, you dated Pil Seung,

827
00:46:35,472 --> 00:46:39,201
and then your engagement
to someone else hit the news.

828
00:46:39,742 --> 00:46:42,971
Do you know what Pil Seung was like
after he thought you had died?

829
00:46:43,541 --> 00:46:46,488
We thought we'd lose him too!

830
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:49,111
He was like an empty shell!

831
00:46:50,021 --> 00:46:52,881
You broke his heart once already.

832
00:46:53,691 --> 00:46:55,721
Just when things
were getting better,

833
00:46:56,162 --> 00:47:00,338
you showed up before him again...

834
00:47:00,362 --> 00:47:03,562
just to drag him down with you?

835
00:47:03,802 --> 00:47:07,272
If you want to die, die on your own!

836
00:47:08,671 --> 00:47:10,142
Go somewhere and die!

837
00:47:23,351 --> 00:47:25,182
I'm sorry, Mother.

838
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:28,352
I'm sorry.

839
00:47:29,862 --> 00:47:31,821
I'm sorry, Mother.

840
00:47:31,862 --> 00:47:33,192
You...

841
00:47:33,731 --> 00:47:36,332
If you care for Pil Seung,

842
00:47:37,362 --> 00:47:40,531
you should leave him right now.

843
00:47:42,202 --> 00:47:45,471
If you care for him at all,

844
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:47,412
even now...

845
00:47:51,182 --> 00:47:52,781
Yes, Mother.

846
00:47:54,081 --> 00:47:55,812
I'll do that.

847
00:47:57,921 --> 00:47:59,321
I'm sorry.

848
00:48:00,222 --> 00:48:02,091
I'm sorry, Mother.

849
00:48:02,992 --> 00:48:04,692
I'm sorry.

850
00:48:05,521 --> 00:48:07,261
I'm sorry.

851
00:48:08,561 --> 00:48:10,232
I'm sorry.

852
00:48:13,271 --> 00:48:14,602
Mom.

853
00:48:17,501 --> 00:48:18,841
She's asleep.

854
00:48:20,271 --> 00:48:21,571
Here.

855
00:48:35,992 --> 00:48:38,662
Hey, Do Ra. Hang on.

856
00:48:40,561 --> 00:48:43,162
Where are you?
I'll come and get you.

857
00:48:43,331 --> 00:48:45,932
Reporters are still around.
You can't come in on your own.

858
00:48:47,032 --> 00:48:49,801
Do Sik. I won't go home.

859
00:48:51,572 --> 00:48:54,111
I'll go somewhere for a while.

860
00:48:54,371 --> 00:48:56,611
You'll go somewhere? Where?

861
00:48:57,182 --> 00:48:58,712
I'll tell you...

862
00:49:00,251 --> 00:49:01,881
later on.

863
00:49:03,322 --> 00:49:05,522
I'm worried about Grandma.

864
00:49:06,081 --> 00:49:08,222
I want to take her with me,

865
00:49:08,222 --> 00:49:10,761
but it would be too much for her.

866
00:49:10,791 --> 00:49:12,121
I can't take her with me.

867
00:49:12,121 --> 00:49:15,207
I'll come too, then.
I'll pack right now.

868
00:49:15,231 --> 00:49:19,162
No, Do Sik. It would be too hard
on both you and her.

869
00:49:19,461 --> 00:49:20,832
That's why.

870
00:49:24,371 --> 00:49:25,841
Are you...

871
00:49:26,972 --> 00:49:29,712
thinking of doing
the same thing again?

872
00:49:29,842 --> 00:49:32,517
If you are,
I won't ever forgive you.

873
00:49:32,541 --> 00:49:34,951
No, I won't do that.

874
00:49:36,651 --> 00:49:38,182
For a while,

875
00:49:39,481 --> 00:49:43,091
until things calm down,
I'll stay somewhere else.

876
00:49:46,121 --> 00:49:47,792
I'm going to break up...

877
00:49:49,061 --> 00:49:50,562
with Pil Seung.

878
00:49:55,702 --> 00:49:57,142
Do Ra.

879
00:49:57,972 --> 00:49:59,341
Do Sik.

880
00:50:01,671 --> 00:50:03,841
I must let him go.

881
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:08,151
Only then can he live.

882
00:50:10,581 --> 00:50:14,091
I can't ruin his life too.

883
00:50:15,691 --> 00:50:18,062
That would be too hard on him.

884
00:50:22,731 --> 00:50:25,232
You know what I mean, don't you?

885
00:50:27,771 --> 00:50:29,071
Yes.

886
00:50:30,401 --> 00:50:32,341
But you promised.

887
00:50:32,842 --> 00:50:34,772
Don't leave us behind.

888
00:50:34,912 --> 00:50:37,111
Don't do anything stupid, okay?

889
00:50:42,751 --> 00:50:44,252
I promise.

890
00:50:46,952 --> 00:50:49,192
Look after Grandma for me.

891
00:50:52,092 --> 00:50:53,491
I'm sorry.

892
00:50:56,961 --> 00:50:58,332
Thank you.

893
00:51:19,081 --> 00:51:20,421
Where's Do Ra?

894
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:24,192
She's not here.

895
00:51:27,092 --> 00:51:30,162
What do you mean she's not here?

896
00:51:32,632 --> 00:51:35,432
She left. Don't look for her.

897
00:51:35,901 --> 00:51:37,872
You two aren't meant to be.

898
00:51:37,972 --> 00:51:39,471
Do Ra...

899
00:51:40,142 --> 00:51:42,372
doesn't want to ruin your life.

900
00:51:49,251 --> 00:51:50,622
Do Sik.

901
00:51:53,492 --> 00:51:55,221
You did enough.

902
00:51:55,851 --> 00:51:59,861
I'm grateful
for all you did for her.

903
00:52:00,932 --> 00:52:03,232
I feel bad to ask any more of you.

904
00:52:04,401 --> 00:52:07,871
If I feel this bad,
how do you think Do Ra feels?

905
00:52:07,871 --> 00:52:09,272
So, please...

906
00:52:10,771 --> 00:52:12,741
forget about her.

907
00:52:17,782 --> 00:52:19,982
What are you talking about?

908
00:52:21,251 --> 00:52:22,682
Where's Do Ra?

909
00:52:23,751 --> 00:52:24,897
Where is she?

910
00:52:24,921 --> 00:52:27,591
I don't know.
She said she'd call again.

911
00:52:31,662 --> 00:52:33,022
Do Sik.

912
00:52:33,992 --> 00:52:36,332
Please tell me where Do Ra is.

913
00:52:39,331 --> 00:52:40,832
I really don't know.

914
00:52:41,371 --> 00:52:44,341
She didn't tell me
in case I'd tell you.

915
00:52:46,472 --> 00:52:47,772
Pil Seung.

916
00:52:50,081 --> 00:52:54,082
Let her go
so she can do what she wants.

917
00:52:55,382 --> 00:52:57,451
Her heart...

918
00:52:57,822 --> 00:52:59,351
must be breaking...

919
00:52:59,351 --> 00:53:01,651
to see your life crumble
because of her.

920
00:53:01,651 --> 00:53:04,522
So let her go!

921
00:53:06,461 --> 00:53:08,292
She can't be alone right now.

922
00:53:09,632 --> 00:53:11,201
Don't you get it?

923
00:53:12,362 --> 00:53:14,801
She can't be alone right now!

924
00:53:32,322 --> 00:53:35,921
Please leave a message
after the tone.

925
00:53:37,021 --> 00:53:39,962
Park Do Ra, where are you?

926
00:53:40,331 --> 00:53:42,162
This is a mistake.

927
00:53:42,262 --> 00:53:44,162
You can't do this to me.

928
00:53:44,532 --> 00:53:46,531
You promised me
that you wouldn't do this.

929
00:53:46,771 --> 00:53:50,201
You said you'd never let my hand go
no matter what!

930
00:53:50,371 --> 00:53:53,772
You'd better tell me
where you are now. Call me!

931
00:53:56,782 --> 00:53:59,712
Ma'am, isn't Ji Young here?

932
00:54:00,081 --> 00:54:02,582
No, she's not here.

933
00:54:03,382 --> 00:54:04,782
She has nowhere else to go
other than here.

934
00:54:04,782 --> 00:54:05,921
Are you sure she's not here?

935
00:54:05,921 --> 00:54:07,521
Tell me if you know anything.
Please?

936
00:54:07,521 --> 00:54:09,521
My goodness. I don't know anything.

937
00:54:09,521 --> 00:54:12,238
I haven't seen Ji Young in a while.

938
00:54:12,262 --> 00:54:14,631
I saw her on the news,
but that's it.

939
00:54:15,262 --> 00:54:16,761
I see.

940
00:54:17,401 --> 00:54:20,401
Please call me if she comes here.
You have to call me.

941
00:54:20,601 --> 00:54:22,332
All right.

942
00:54:27,512 --> 00:54:30,341
Director, wait.

943
00:54:30,711 --> 00:54:34,782
Well, Ji Young really isn't here.

944
00:54:34,782 --> 00:54:38,022
Ji Young isn't here.

945
00:54:41,952 --> 00:54:43,338
Thank you.

946
00:54:43,362 --> 00:54:46,634
(Bed and Breakfast)

947
00:54:58,041 --> 00:54:59,542
Park Do Ra!

948
00:55:17,222 --> 00:55:18,692
Do Ra.

949
00:55:20,791 --> 00:55:22,292
Park Do Ra.

950
00:55:23,831 --> 00:55:25,761
Seriously,
why are you doing this to me?

951
00:55:26,702 --> 00:55:28,901
Why must you break my heart
like this?

952
00:55:30,842 --> 00:55:32,872
You promised me...

953
00:55:33,612 --> 00:55:35,511
that you wouldn't do this!

954
00:55:37,842 --> 00:55:40,381
You're having a hard time
because of me.

955
00:55:43,552 --> 00:55:45,252
No, I'm fine.

956
00:55:46,592 --> 00:55:48,692
I'll have a hard time
without you in my life!

957
00:55:49,961 --> 00:55:52,162
Why won't you believe me? Why?

958
00:56:32,001 --> 00:56:33,872
My gosh.

959
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:39,171
Good riddance.

960
00:56:41,311 --> 00:56:42,917
But...

961
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:45,442
Park Do Ra and Ko Pil Seung.

962
00:56:45,811 --> 00:56:47,352
By now,

963
00:56:47,782 --> 00:56:51,622
they must've ended things
after fighting...

964
00:56:51,981 --> 00:56:53,892
and blaming each other, right?

965
00:56:58,291 --> 00:56:59,692
Ko Pil Seung.

966
00:57:00,432 --> 00:57:02,361
You'll have no choice...

967
00:57:04,331 --> 00:57:06,801
but to ditch her
if you want to survive.

968
00:57:09,501 --> 00:57:11,071
Oh, my.

969
00:57:11,871 --> 00:57:13,711
Even the air in the office...

970
00:57:13,711 --> 00:57:16,312
feels cleaner
now that Ko Pil Seung is gone.

971
00:57:21,516 --> 00:57:25,757
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

972
00:57:25,782 --> 00:57:26,851
Let's see.

973
00:57:27,952 --> 00:57:29,904
(CEO Jung)

974
00:57:30,222 --> 00:57:32,192
Why is Mr. Jung calling?

975
00:57:35,432 --> 00:57:36,861
Hey, Mr. Jung.

976
00:57:37,101 --> 00:57:38,577
What's up?

977
00:57:38,601 --> 00:57:40,502
Mr. Gong, we have a problem.

978
00:57:41,202 --> 00:57:42,932
What's going on?

979
00:57:43,032 --> 00:57:45,272
Hwang, whom we had sent
to the Philippines,

980
00:57:45,541 --> 00:57:47,372
is back in Korea now.

981
00:57:48,371 --> 00:57:50,741
Hwang? Which one?

982
00:57:53,711 --> 00:57:57,182
What? That guy, Hwang?

983
00:57:57,952 --> 00:58:00,752
He was supposed to stay
in the Philippines for good.

984
00:58:00,892 --> 00:58:03,221
He said he'd never come back
to Korea!

985
00:58:03,291 --> 00:58:04,761
Right, the thing is,

986
00:58:05,791 --> 00:58:07,892
he said he had to return
because of his sick mother,

987
00:58:08,231 --> 00:58:09,631
but he's broke.

988
00:58:10,032 --> 00:58:12,432
He said he'd return
to the Philippines...

989
00:58:12,432 --> 00:58:14,401
as soon as his mother received
the treatment she needed.

990
00:58:14,401 --> 00:58:15,832
He's asking for money.

991
00:58:16,132 --> 00:58:17,502
What should I do?

992
00:58:17,671 --> 00:58:19,901
Darn it.

993
00:58:20,541 --> 00:58:23,171
I gave him enough money back then.
He's asking for more?

994
00:58:24,612 --> 00:58:26,388
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

995
00:58:26,412 --> 00:58:27,781
Fine.

996
00:58:27,851 --> 00:58:30,921
But you'll have to give him
a stern warning.

997
00:58:32,021 --> 00:58:35,752
If he shows up in Korea
and asks for money again,

998
00:58:38,421 --> 00:58:40,892
he really will pay for it.

999
00:58:47,632 --> 00:58:49,102
I'll certainly remember that.

1000
00:58:50,842 --> 00:58:52,171
Thank you.

1001
00:59:02,382 --> 00:59:04,482
He has extorted so much money
from me.

1002
00:59:05,722 --> 00:59:08,022
If he gets caught,
he'll end up in jail too.

1003
00:59:08,892 --> 00:59:10,221
Yes.

1004
00:59:10,662 --> 00:59:12,721
He won't do anything stupid.

1005
00:59:29,742 --> 00:59:31,042
Do Ra.

1006
00:59:38,282 --> 00:59:40,522
You can always run away.

1007
00:59:41,291 --> 00:59:43,022
So, even if you do decide
to run away,

1008
00:59:44,291 --> 00:59:45,991
we'll run away together later on.

1009
00:59:49,061 --> 00:59:50,662
Before we decide to run away,

1010
00:59:51,862 --> 00:59:53,761
let's try everything we can do.

1011
00:59:55,532 --> 00:59:57,401
Let's resolve our problems,
one by one.

1012
00:59:59,171 --> 01:00:00,872
It may take some time,

1013
01:00:02,142 --> 01:00:03,812
but let's try our best.

1014
01:00:05,081 --> 01:00:07,042
Even if no one...

1015
01:00:07,751 --> 01:00:09,381
believes you or us,

1016
01:00:11,121 --> 01:00:12,551
let's tell them the truth...

1017
01:00:13,921 --> 01:00:17,221
and explain we're innocent
before we run away, okay?

1018
01:00:20,791 --> 01:00:22,162
Do Ra.

1019
01:00:24,331 --> 01:00:26,062
Don't do this again alone.

1020
01:00:29,802 --> 01:00:31,142
Let's go.

1021
01:00:32,242 --> 01:00:33,912
I'll take you home.

1022
01:00:38,481 --> 01:00:39,982
You'll come with me, right?

1023
01:00:54,862 --> 01:00:56,591
Yes, come on in.

1024
01:00:57,331 --> 01:01:00,502
Anyway, what brings you ladies here?

1025
01:01:01,632 --> 01:01:04,241
I heard
Sun Young wasn't feeling well.

1026
01:01:05,271 --> 01:01:06,271
Here.

1027
01:01:06,271 --> 01:01:08,212
What?

1028
01:01:08,512 --> 01:01:10,441
We got you
some medicinal herbal tea.

1029
01:01:10,441 --> 01:01:13,381
Make sure you and Sun Young
drink it regularly.

1030
01:01:13,782 --> 01:01:16,151
All right. Thank you.

1031
01:01:16,412 --> 01:01:20,852
By the way, are the reporters
still camping outside?

1032
01:01:21,392 --> 01:01:24,421
Not today. I didn't see
a single reporter today.

1033
01:01:25,191 --> 01:01:27,591
I guess they all gave up.

1034
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:29,561
They were camping outside...

1035
01:01:29,561 --> 01:01:31,502
until very late at night
without going home.

1036
01:01:31,632 --> 01:01:33,662
My goodness.

1037
01:01:34,731 --> 01:01:36,901
Pil Seung! Oh, dear.

1038
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:40,942
Pil Seung, where have you been?
I couldn't even reach you.

1039
01:01:41,311 --> 01:01:43,882
Do you know how worried we were?

1040
01:01:43,882 --> 01:01:46,081
- Pil Seung is here?
- Pil Seung.

1041
01:01:46,081 --> 01:01:49,381
Pil Seung, are you all right?

1042
01:01:49,552 --> 01:01:51,651
Where have you been?

1043
01:01:53,151 --> 01:01:54,451
I'm fine.

1044
01:01:55,351 --> 01:01:56,892
I have something to tell you.

1045
01:02:01,392 --> 01:02:02,692
Mom.

1046
01:02:03,461 --> 01:02:04,861
Dad.

1047
01:02:06,061 --> 01:02:08,031
I've never said this
to anyone before.

1048
01:02:11,871 --> 01:02:14,171
The truth is,
Do Ra tried to take her own life...

1049
01:02:17,182 --> 01:02:18,781
because of me.

1050
01:02:21,581 --> 01:02:22,912
What?

1051
01:02:22,952 --> 01:02:24,281
Pil Seung.

1052
01:02:24,921 --> 01:02:28,252
What do you mean she tried
to take her own life because of you?

1053
01:02:28,322 --> 01:02:30,622
Mom, be quiet.

1054
01:02:31,791 --> 01:02:34,392
I'll tell you the truth behind...

1055
01:02:34,592 --> 01:02:36,761
the sponsorship scandal
everyone is talking about.

1056
01:02:37,932 --> 01:02:41,002
Someone hired a reenactment actor
named Hwang Jeong Sik...

1057
01:02:41,432 --> 01:02:43,301
to call Do Ra to the hotel...

1058
01:02:43,532 --> 01:02:45,642
using the meeting about the ad contract
as an excuse...

1059
01:02:45,642 --> 01:02:47,511
and to make it look like
she had a sponsor.

1060
01:02:48,671 --> 01:02:50,642
After that,
he fled to the Philippines.

1061
01:02:53,012 --> 01:02:54,651
But back then,

1062
01:02:56,452 --> 01:02:58,281
I didn't believe Do Ra either.

1063
01:03:01,251 --> 01:03:03,421
When Do Ra was being
falsely accused like that,

1064
01:03:04,722 --> 01:03:06,692
she came to see me
thinking I was her last hope.

1065
01:03:09,331 --> 01:03:11,832
She said it wasn't true at all
and begged me to believe her.

1066
01:03:14,932 --> 01:03:16,602
She said she thought I,

1067
01:03:18,142 --> 01:03:19,942
of all people, would believe her,

1068
01:03:23,472 --> 01:03:25,142
but I didn't.

1069
01:03:26,682 --> 01:03:28,051
And...

1070
01:03:30,452 --> 01:03:32,221
she took her life that day.

1071
01:03:40,262 --> 01:03:41,591
Mom.

1072
01:03:42,961 --> 01:03:44,332
Dad.

1073
01:03:47,072 --> 01:03:48,701
You two know...

1074
01:03:50,072 --> 01:03:51,942
how much pain I was in...

1075
01:03:53,601 --> 01:03:55,341
after Do Ra died.

1076
01:03:57,242 --> 01:03:58,642
But then,

1077
01:03:59,412 --> 01:04:01,252
Do Ra came back to me.

1078
01:04:02,952 --> 01:04:04,381
Mom,

1079
01:04:05,621 --> 01:04:07,852
how can you ask me
to abandon her again?

1080
01:04:09,492 --> 01:04:10,921
Do Ra is...

1081
01:04:11,561 --> 01:04:13,622
on the edge of a cliff again,

1082
01:04:14,691 --> 01:04:16,631
but you're telling me
to abandon her.

1083
01:04:19,601 --> 01:04:21,002
Mom.

1084
01:04:21,632 --> 01:04:23,002
Dad.

1085
01:04:23,842 --> 01:04:25,741
Is that what you truly want?

1086
01:04:27,512 --> 01:04:29,912
Do you want me...

1087
01:04:29,972 --> 01:04:31,412
to regret it my whole life...

1088
01:04:32,081 --> 01:04:34,852
and live in agony?

1089
01:04:48,992 --> 01:04:51,831
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1090
01:05:24,115 --> 01:05:26,044
Who was the one
to leak to the press...

1091
01:05:26,044 --> 01:05:28,460
about Park Do Ra
on the day of Pil Seung's wedding?

1092
01:05:28,484 --> 01:05:29,684
Get Hwang out of the country.

1093
01:05:29,684 --> 01:05:30,954
He must leave this instant.

1094
01:05:30,954 --> 01:05:32,330
I can't take it anymore.

1095
01:05:32,354 --> 01:05:33,754
You did nothing...

1096
01:05:33,754 --> 01:05:36,370
to deserve such vile comments
from people.

1097
01:05:36,394 --> 01:05:38,571
Do Ra, we'll tackle this head-on.

1098
01:05:38,595 --> 01:05:41,511
Head-on? What do you mean by that?
