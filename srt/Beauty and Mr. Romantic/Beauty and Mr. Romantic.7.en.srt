1
00:00:00,106 --> 00:00:07,425
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:08,343 --> 00:00:11,013
But putting up with her
isn't a stroll in the park.

3
00:00:11,013 --> 00:00:13,313
I now get
why people call her Snark Do Ra.

4
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:15,782
I lose my mind
dozens of times a day!

5
00:00:27,233 --> 00:00:28,362
Park...

6
00:00:29,332 --> 00:00:30,332
Park...

7
00:00:31,672 --> 00:00:33,033
Ms. Park?

8
00:00:37,202 --> 00:00:38,373
What just happened?

9
00:00:40,312 --> 00:00:41,682
How did she show up
from behind there?

10
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:44,952
How...

11
00:00:48,422 --> 00:00:50,123
You've got to be kidding me.

12
00:00:51,793 --> 00:00:53,593
- Hey, it's...
- Wait!

13
00:00:54,023 --> 00:00:56,223
She'd have to be a ghost
to show up from behind that.

14
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,733
As if it was her you actually saw.

15
00:01:04,973 --> 00:01:07,002
Ms. Park, wait.

16
00:01:07,373 --> 00:01:09,502
Ms. Park!

17
00:01:10,072 --> 00:01:11,613
Jae Dong, wait.

18
00:01:12,012 --> 00:01:14,313
Jae Dong, hold on.

19
00:01:14,712 --> 00:01:16,083
Ms. Park!

20
00:01:16,482 --> 00:01:17,953
Stop!

21
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:23,283
He has some nerve
running after you like this.

22
00:01:24,523 --> 00:01:27,223
What will it be, Do Ra?
Should I pull over?

23
00:01:27,923 --> 00:01:29,523
- Ms. Park!
- Keep driving.

24
00:01:29,962 --> 00:01:31,393
- Sure.
- Stop right there!

25
00:01:32,232 --> 00:01:33,732
Ms. Park!

26
00:01:34,602 --> 00:01:35,803
Ms. Park.

27
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:46,072
- The number is unavailable.
- What do I do?

28
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:47,473
What am I going to do?

29
00:01:49,512 --> 00:01:51,783
You moron!

30
00:02:07,792 --> 00:02:09,962
Bong Soo, come on.

31
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,432
I didn't do it because I wanted to.

32
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:13,432
It was to make your life easier.

33
00:02:13,432 --> 00:02:16,242
Catering to her every whim
will make things easier for you.

34
00:02:16,242 --> 00:02:18,143
But putting up with her
isn't a stroll in the park.

35
00:02:18,143 --> 00:02:19,773
I now get
why people call her Snark Do Ra.

36
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:22,113
I lose my mind
dozens of times a day!

37
00:02:27,053 --> 00:02:28,622
Ko Pil Seung, you!

38
00:02:28,622 --> 00:02:31,252
Why did you say such things,
you moron?

39
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,263
What now?

40
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:37,622
What am I going to do?

41
00:02:38,793 --> 00:02:42,733
What am I going to do about this?

42
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:57,113
My gosh. What's up with Pil Seung?

43
00:02:57,113 --> 00:02:58,182
Goodness.

44
00:02:58,853 --> 00:03:01,523
Just leave him be
and pretend you heard nothing.

45
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:07,323
Hold on.
Something must be up at work.

46
00:03:08,293 --> 00:03:10,062
Could he have made a big mistake?

47
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,062
Was he reprimanded for it?

48
00:03:13,263 --> 00:03:16,703
If not... Could someone
be bullying him at work?

49
00:03:17,002 --> 00:03:19,603
Come on. There isn't a job
that is easy to manage.

50
00:03:19,603 --> 00:03:21,803
You're supposed to withstand
the good and the bad...

51
00:03:21,803 --> 00:03:24,103
and experience everything
that comes your way.

52
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:26,013
He's still
a rookie assistant director,

53
00:03:26,543 --> 00:03:28,613
so he must walk on eggshells
around the director and actors.

54
00:03:28,613 --> 00:03:30,412
He hasn't spoken to us about it,

55
00:03:30,812 --> 00:03:33,312
but I'm sure he's being
put through the wringer.

56
00:03:33,312 --> 00:03:36,152
It's not just Pil Seung
who has a tough time.

57
00:03:36,553 --> 00:03:40,222
Besides, he won't be
a rookie assistant director forever.

58
00:03:40,652 --> 00:03:42,162
After a few projects,

59
00:03:42,162 --> 00:03:43,662
he'll get to play
the seniority card too.

60
00:03:44,562 --> 00:03:46,692
As if it's a big deal.

61
00:03:47,763 --> 00:03:49,502
Gosh, this is upsetting.

62
00:03:50,532 --> 00:03:52,673
It's not like I can
do the work for him.

63
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,412
Ju Hee, are you getting married?

64
00:04:03,342 --> 00:04:04,342
Yes.

65
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:07,152
So stop thinking
you still have a chance with me...

66
00:04:07,152 --> 00:04:08,423
and don't contact me again.

67
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:10,583
My boo won't like it.

68
00:04:11,523 --> 00:04:13,222
Were you cheating on me?

69
00:04:13,492 --> 00:04:14,622
How can it be cheating...

70
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:17,763
when I never reciprocated
your feelings?

71
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,092
Why can't it be me?

72
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:24,032
When I proposed to you,
you said you didn't want to marry.

73
00:04:24,032 --> 00:04:26,073
How does a wedding invitation
make sense right now?

74
00:04:26,672 --> 00:04:28,943
Why can it be him and not me?

75
00:04:28,943 --> 00:04:29,943
Do Sik,

76
00:04:29,943 --> 00:04:33,042
he has the ability
to make my dreams come true.

77
00:04:34,143 --> 00:04:36,542
We agreed to study abroad together.

78
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,212
I can do that as well.

79
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:40,383
My baby brother's
currently studying abroad.

80
00:04:40,383 --> 00:04:42,823
Don't be like that
and let me take you instead.

81
00:04:42,823 --> 00:04:43,852
Have you lost your mind?

82
00:04:43,852 --> 00:04:45,592
He's only two years my senior.

83
00:04:45,592 --> 00:04:47,523
Meanwhile, you're eight years
older than me.

84
00:04:48,962 --> 00:04:51,763
Do Sik, stop being so clingy.

85
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:53,232
I wish you well.

86
00:04:55,933 --> 00:04:57,102
Ju Hee, I...

87
00:05:15,052 --> 00:05:17,922
The night breeze sure is refreshing.

88
00:05:19,893 --> 00:05:21,962
No way.

89
00:05:22,123 --> 00:05:24,862
It's like a scene
from a romantic comedy.

90
00:05:26,532 --> 00:05:29,203
It seems as though we click.

91
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:30,933
Let's meet up every Wednesday.

92
00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:33,472
Friends? Okay, I'm down with that.

93
00:05:33,472 --> 00:05:36,972
On Wednesdays,
let there be red roses!

94
00:05:45,183 --> 00:05:48,323
Goodness. Am I drunk?

95
00:05:48,753 --> 00:05:50,323
Or have I gone crazy?

96
00:05:50,823 --> 00:05:53,052
Why am I thinking of the jerk...

97
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,893
who dumped me, calling it a mistake?

98
00:05:56,162 --> 00:05:57,222
Darn it.

99
00:06:04,933 --> 00:06:07,703
Why don't I hate that jerk?

100
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:10,243
Why do I keep missing him?

101
00:06:11,513 --> 00:06:12,573
Why?

102
00:06:15,313 --> 00:06:17,513
You evil witch!

103
00:06:21,212 --> 00:06:22,583
How could you...

104
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:26,422
crush my pure love
for you like this?

105
00:06:28,993 --> 00:06:30,563
Why is it him...

106
00:06:30,563 --> 00:06:33,462
but not me?

107
00:06:34,232 --> 00:06:35,232
My gosh.

108
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:38,602
That man must be hurt too.

109
00:06:38,602 --> 00:06:39,602
Fine.

110
00:06:39,972 --> 00:06:42,143
Leave. Go away.

111
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,943
How sad must he be
to react like that?

112
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:51,912
What's up with him?

113
00:06:53,753 --> 00:06:55,023
Is he going to die?

114
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:58,993
No. You can't. No!

115
00:06:59,623 --> 00:07:01,523
Hey! Don't!

116
00:07:01,662 --> 00:07:02,763
Wait!

117
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:05,532
You can't do this.

118
00:07:09,802 --> 00:07:11,433
Who's this?

119
00:07:15,342 --> 00:07:18,172
What are you doing out here?
Why are you here?

120
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:21,073
Ju Hee.

121
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:25,612
Hey.

122
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,453
I knew you'd come.

123
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:30,523
Don't go anywhere now.

124
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:32,893
Stay by my side.

125
00:07:51,573 --> 00:07:52,643
Fine.

126
00:07:55,313 --> 00:07:57,212
I'll be there by your side.

127
00:08:13,263 --> 00:08:14,433
What happened?

128
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:18,602
Why on earth
am I here with her again?

129
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,412
Do Sik, what's the matter with you?

130
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,883
No, I can't waste time.

131
00:08:29,883 --> 00:08:31,443
I must get out of here
before she wakes up.

132
00:08:39,592 --> 00:08:41,623
She's a psycho.

133
00:08:42,593 --> 00:08:43,593
Goodness.

134
00:08:47,932 --> 00:08:49,832
What? You want to run away again?

135
00:08:50,932 --> 00:08:53,603
Don't do this.
Let go so we can talk.

136
00:08:54,973 --> 00:08:57,402
Are you a weirdo? A psycho?

137
00:08:57,572 --> 00:08:59,373
Why did you tie us together
with my tie?

138
00:08:59,643 --> 00:09:00,873
In case you did this again.

139
00:09:00,912 --> 00:09:03,682
Once is a mistake, but twice isn't.

140
00:09:04,113 --> 00:09:06,152
What? Are you going to
call it a mistake again?

141
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:11,023
Come on.

142
00:09:12,723 --> 00:09:15,422
I'm really sorry.
Will you let me off?

143
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,463
The situation tells me...

144
00:09:18,463 --> 00:09:20,332
I went and made another mistake.

145
00:09:20,932 --> 00:09:22,662
I really don't remember...

146
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,332
what happened last night
and why we're here.

147
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:29,743
Yesterday, due to personal reasons,
I had a lot to drink.

148
00:09:30,273 --> 00:09:31,643
I wasn't in my right mind.

149
00:09:32,412 --> 00:09:34,942
I don't know
if I went and messed up...

150
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:36,613
while I was black-out drunk.

151
00:09:39,483 --> 00:09:40,782
Please let me go.

152
00:09:42,723 --> 00:09:45,223
Please cut me loose.

153
00:09:45,822 --> 00:09:47,853
Why are you doing this to me?

154
00:09:51,993 --> 00:09:55,103
Fine.
I don't want to do this anymore.

155
00:09:55,432 --> 00:09:57,302
Leave! Get out!

156
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:00,473
Darn it.

157
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:11,483
It's my fault
for falling for a jerk like him.

158
00:10:12,213 --> 00:10:13,412
Let's forget about him.

159
00:10:14,082 --> 00:10:15,123
Yes.

160
00:10:15,552 --> 00:10:18,322
I'll erase him from my memory.

161
00:10:19,393 --> 00:10:21,192
I'll erase him.

162
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:25,192
Chairman Gong and Jin Dan.
Have a good day at work.

163
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:26,963
Take care.

164
00:10:27,993 --> 00:10:29,902
- I'm off, then, Auntie.
- Okay.

165
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:33,003
Mother.

166
00:10:34,273 --> 00:10:37,672
Okay. Have a nice day,
Chairman Gong.

167
00:10:37,902 --> 00:10:39,373
You too, Jin Dan.

168
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:49,523
(Queen Mother)

169
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,483
Hello, Queen Mother.

170
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:54,552
Jin Dan. Did you hear that?

171
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:56,822
Your brother called me "Mother."

172
00:10:57,062 --> 00:10:59,233
Of course I heard it.
I was right there.

173
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:03,162
Jin Dan. I'm so pleased,
I think my heart will explode.

174
00:11:03,532 --> 00:11:06,432
To think that Jin Taek
finally called you "Mother."

175
00:11:07,532 --> 00:11:10,343
Mom.
It felt weird when I heard that.

176
00:11:10,343 --> 00:11:12,412
It was touching too.

177
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,213
I'm glad I put up with
the insult until now.

178
00:11:15,582 --> 00:11:17,782
I went from living
in the cold shadows...

179
00:11:17,942 --> 00:11:19,613
to moving to the warm sunshine.

180
00:11:20,052 --> 00:11:21,552
Anyway, I'm so pleased.

181
00:11:21,713 --> 00:11:23,322
I'm pleased that you're pleased.

182
00:11:23,322 --> 00:11:26,353
Son. What's wrong
with your sister-in-law?

183
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:28,993
She's the only one
who won't call me "Mother."

184
00:11:29,263 --> 00:11:30,822
I can't stand her.

185
00:11:30,922 --> 00:11:32,893
I'm sure she'll come around soon.

186
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:35,093
Jin Taek called you "Mother."

187
00:11:35,093 --> 00:11:36,532
What choice does she have?

188
00:11:36,802 --> 00:11:40,402
So Mom. Don't go
picking fights with her, okay?

189
00:11:40,402 --> 00:11:41,503
I won't, son.

190
00:11:41,843 --> 00:11:43,773
Have a great day.

191
00:11:48,373 --> 00:11:50,643
Hey. Are you going out?

192
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:53,383
Yes. I'm going out.

193
00:11:53,452 --> 00:11:54,513
What?

194
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:57,152
"I'm going out?"

195
00:11:57,782 --> 00:12:00,652
Soo Yeon.
Did you just talk down at me?

196
00:12:03,993 --> 00:12:07,162
I'm going out to run some errands.

197
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:11,532
Soo Yeon.
Why won't you say "Mother" too?

198
00:12:11,973 --> 00:12:15,133
Your husband
called me that politely.

199
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:16,442
Why won't you?

200
00:12:17,402 --> 00:12:19,912
Will you grow a thorn
if you say "Mother?"

201
00:12:20,013 --> 00:12:21,373
Will your mouth blister?

202
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:26,483
Okay, fine, Mother, Mother, Mother.

203
00:12:26,652 --> 00:12:29,483
I'm going out,
Mother, Mother, Mother.

204
00:12:29,723 --> 00:12:30,853
Will that do?

205
00:12:33,623 --> 00:12:35,963
My goodness. What was that about?

206
00:12:36,263 --> 00:12:38,062
Is that the quota for the day?

207
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:41,532
She doesn't want to
acknowledge me that bad?

208
00:12:41,963 --> 00:12:44,802
Fine. Wait and see.

209
00:12:45,233 --> 00:12:48,743
I'll teach you a lesson somehow.

210
00:12:49,172 --> 00:12:50,672
She has to pay.

211
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:59,582
Why does Mistress Grandma Hong
treat Mom like that?

212
00:12:59,883 --> 00:13:01,253
I'll make her pay.

213
00:13:17,532 --> 00:13:20,672
Ms. Park.
Did you read the text I sent?

214
00:13:20,672 --> 00:13:22,373
I texted you
because you didn't pick up.

215
00:13:22,603 --> 00:13:24,572
I offended you, didn't I?

216
00:13:24,773 --> 00:13:26,343
I don't want to see you,
so get lost.

217
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:32,582
I can't make an excuse even if
I had a hundred mouths to use.

218
00:13:33,052 --> 00:13:34,582
But I didn't say that
because I hated you,

219
00:13:34,582 --> 00:13:37,282
or because
you really drove me insane.

220
00:13:37,523 --> 00:13:39,523
You and Mr. Cha kept butting heads,

221
00:13:39,523 --> 00:13:41,993
and it messed
with our filming schedule.

222
00:13:42,192 --> 00:13:45,062
I wanted to somehow
complete the shoot...

223
00:13:45,062 --> 00:13:47,192
So you kept switching sides?

224
00:13:47,832 --> 00:13:50,363
Sweet-talking me and then him,
which is not nice at all?

225
00:13:52,902 --> 00:13:53,902
I'm sorry.

226
00:13:55,643 --> 00:13:56,702
So...

227
00:13:57,473 --> 00:13:59,513
you know you were in the wrong.

228
00:14:01,912 --> 00:14:02,942
Yes.

229
00:14:03,782 --> 00:14:07,213
But all I cared about
was the project.

230
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:08,282
What?

231
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:11,822
You did that for the project?

232
00:14:13,993 --> 00:14:15,822
What is wrong with you?

233
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,733
I can't work
with a lowlife like you.

234
00:14:20,032 --> 00:14:23,162
So get out of my sight.

235
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:24,263
Right now!

236
00:14:25,503 --> 00:14:28,003
- Ms. Park.
- Get him out of here!

237
00:14:28,503 --> 00:14:29,603
Please!

238
00:14:38,883 --> 00:14:39,952
Goodness.

239
00:14:40,282 --> 00:14:42,652
Pil Seung.

240
00:14:42,652 --> 00:14:44,523
How did you end up saying that?

241
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,452
It's all your fault.

242
00:14:49,292 --> 00:14:51,922
You told me to
go between the two so we could...

243
00:14:51,922 --> 00:14:53,332
film on schedule.

244
00:14:54,133 --> 00:14:57,332
You fool. Is that all you heard?

245
00:14:57,733 --> 00:14:59,103
I warned you.

246
00:14:59,103 --> 00:15:01,503
Places with sliding doors,
alleys, toilets.

247
00:15:01,603 --> 00:15:03,873
When talking in such places,
see if the coast's clear first.

248
00:15:03,873 --> 00:15:05,412
Check multiple times...

249
00:15:05,412 --> 00:15:07,143
that you're alone before you talk.

250
00:15:07,513 --> 00:15:10,182
The next room was empty
when we went in.

251
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:11,442
Okay, fine.

252
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,812
I'll handle Park Do Ra from now on.

253
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,312
You work on Cha Bong Soo.

254
00:15:15,652 --> 00:15:17,883
Do Ra looked really furious earlier.

255
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:20,192
What if she refuses
to shoot again because of you?

256
00:15:20,922 --> 00:15:22,692
That would be a disaster.

257
00:15:22,692 --> 00:15:25,593
So make sure to lie low
and stay out of her sight...

258
00:15:25,593 --> 00:15:28,162
for the time being, okay?

259
00:15:30,603 --> 00:15:31,603
I get it.

260
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:34,032
All right.

261
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,912
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

262
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,052
Ko Pil Seung.

263
00:15:52,853 --> 00:15:55,792
What is it that I just saw?

264
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:58,223
Auntie Myung Dong.

265
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:03,432
Pil Seung, let go of me.

266
00:16:03,432 --> 00:16:05,572
I swear I will teach
Park Do Ra, that brat, a lesson.

267
00:16:06,003 --> 00:16:08,202
Auntie Myung Dong,
will you please calm down?

268
00:16:08,202 --> 00:16:10,873
Hey! How can I
possibly calm down now?

269
00:16:11,042 --> 00:16:13,613
I just saw what Park Do Ra did
to you with my own eyes.

270
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:17,143
Park Do Ra is such an evil wench.

271
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:19,853
When she was our tenant,
I was nothing but nice to her,

272
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,782
buying her hairpins and hotteok.

273
00:16:22,253 --> 00:16:24,123
How could she return evil
for good like that?

274
00:16:25,023 --> 00:16:27,692
Who on earth is she
to harass you like that?

275
00:16:29,062 --> 00:16:30,363
This is unacceptable.

276
00:16:30,363 --> 00:16:32,062
I can never let this slide.

277
00:16:32,062 --> 00:16:34,162
I'm going to kill her today.

278
00:16:34,162 --> 00:16:35,162
Auntie Myung Dong.

279
00:16:35,802 --> 00:16:38,003
Do Ra doesn't know I'm Ko Dae Chung.

280
00:16:38,603 --> 00:16:40,402
What? She doesn't?

281
00:16:41,402 --> 00:16:43,273
Why not? How does she not know?

282
00:16:43,273 --> 00:16:45,143
I changed my name.

283
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:48,042
But still...

284
00:16:49,143 --> 00:16:51,182
- Are you sure she doesn't know?
- Yes.

285
00:16:51,182 --> 00:16:53,582
We know Do Ra
because we see her on TV every day.

286
00:16:53,582 --> 00:16:55,182
But she didn't see me for 15 years.

287
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:56,822
And my face looks different now.

288
00:16:57,123 --> 00:16:59,093
Actually, I pretended
I didn't know her.

289
00:16:59,093 --> 00:17:01,223
If she finds out,
I'll be uncomfortable at work.

290
00:17:02,093 --> 00:17:03,822
Still, I just can't let go of this.

291
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,263
Just wait till your mom finds out...

292
00:17:05,263 --> 00:17:06,733
how you've been
letting her treat you.

293
00:17:06,733 --> 00:17:08,493
Your mom will faint from the shock.

294
00:17:09,263 --> 00:17:11,933
I'm so furious
that I can't take this anymore.

295
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:14,632
Auntie Myung Dong, I'm begging you.

296
00:17:14,632 --> 00:17:16,743
Pretend you didn't see anything
and leave, please.

297
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,812
No one here knows...

298
00:17:19,812 --> 00:17:22,183
that Do Ra and I used to live
in the same building.

299
00:17:23,983 --> 00:17:24,983
Auntie Myung Dong.

300
00:17:25,882 --> 00:17:27,582
Things are already hard for me.

301
00:17:27,582 --> 00:17:29,322
Don't make it worse.

302
00:17:29,322 --> 00:17:30,382
I'm begging you.

303
00:17:30,923 --> 00:17:33,653
This is really driving me crazy.

304
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:34,852
It's so upsetting.

305
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:36,362
Darn it.

306
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:37,923
Auntie Myung Dong.

307
00:17:38,263 --> 00:17:40,362
Don't tell Mom
about what happened today.

308
00:17:40,362 --> 00:17:41,362
Okay?

309
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:42,802
I can't promise anything.

310
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:44,562
My gosh.

311
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:47,673
It's already hard for me,
and now Auntie Myung Dong knows.

312
00:17:48,773 --> 00:17:50,903
Darn it! Nothing's working out here!

313
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,213
Stay out of my sight.

314
00:17:55,312 --> 00:17:56,983
If I ever catch a glimpse of you,

315
00:17:58,042 --> 00:18:01,052
I'll kill you!

316
00:18:02,983 --> 00:18:04,453
Cut. Not good enough.

317
00:18:05,483 --> 00:18:08,592
Do Ra, you're being too emotional.

318
00:18:08,892 --> 00:18:11,592
And your lines don't say
"I'll kill you."

319
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:12,933
- No, right?
- Give me the script.

320
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:15,263
- Did I miss something?
- Try to suppress your feelings.

321
00:18:15,933 --> 00:18:17,632
We will take a short break.

322
00:18:20,403 --> 00:18:21,532
I'm hungry.

323
00:18:24,973 --> 00:18:27,372
She's upset with me,
and she's taking it out on him.

324
00:18:29,582 --> 00:18:32,713
Do Ra doesn't usually
make a mistake like that.

325
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,882
She must be feeling
so furious and betrayed now.

326
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,782
Jae Dong, wait.

327
00:18:39,122 --> 00:18:41,253
Who are you?
Why are you talking to me?

328
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:42,693
Please get your hands off me.

329
00:18:42,693 --> 00:18:44,292
Why are you being like this to me?

330
00:18:44,292 --> 00:18:46,493
Jae Dong, please help me.

331
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:48,463
Please tell Ms. Park...

332
00:18:48,592 --> 00:18:51,933
that I didn't say such a thing
because I hated her.

333
00:18:52,003 --> 00:18:53,872
Assistant Director Ko Pil Seung.

334
00:18:53,872 --> 00:18:56,142
I was behind
the sliding door yesterday.

335
00:18:58,913 --> 00:19:00,913
Assistant Director Ko,
it was so mean of you to say that.

336
00:19:00,913 --> 00:19:03,443
When I heard you talk
behind Do Ra's back yesterday,

337
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:05,753
I was so hurt
that I couldn't sleep all night.

338
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:09,653
Even I'm so upset.
I can't even imagine how Do Ra is feeling.

339
00:19:10,923 --> 00:19:14,122
I told Do Ra not to trust you.

340
00:19:14,122 --> 00:19:17,663
I even said you were talking
behind her back with Cha Bong Soo.

341
00:19:17,862 --> 00:19:20,993
But when Do Ra heard that,
she scolded me...

342
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,763
saying that was the last thing
you would do.

343
00:19:24,203 --> 00:19:27,302
How could you stab her
in the back like that?

344
00:19:28,003 --> 00:19:29,842
You don't want to live like that.

345
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:31,842
What a bat.

346
00:19:32,773 --> 00:19:34,112
I know it sounds like an excuse,

347
00:19:35,473 --> 00:19:37,112
but you know the situation I'm in.

348
00:19:38,183 --> 00:19:39,852
I'm an understrapper here.

349
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:42,382
I just do as I'm told,

350
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:44,082
and I should cater
to everyone's whim.

351
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:46,092
I never get to say no.

352
00:19:47,122 --> 00:19:48,352
That's my job, you know.

353
00:19:49,423 --> 00:19:51,292
It's not like I said such a thing
because I wanted to.

354
00:19:52,493 --> 00:19:53,832
It's my job to please the actors...

355
00:19:53,832 --> 00:19:55,592
so we can finish this project
without a hitch.

356
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:58,463
That's how it happened.

357
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,203
It's not true
that I hold grudges against her.

358
00:20:06,312 --> 00:20:07,973
Jae Dong, you're just like me.

359
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,513
You understand
where I'm coming from.

360
00:20:11,582 --> 00:20:12,653
That's just...

361
00:20:13,953 --> 00:20:16,552
I don't know. Don't say
anything like that to me.

362
00:20:27,562 --> 00:20:29,362
Park Do Ra used to like tteokbokki.

363
00:20:30,763 --> 00:20:32,903
Will this spicy tteokbokki
help her feel better?

364
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:39,943
Ma'am, please give me
a generous serving of the sauce.

365
00:20:41,243 --> 00:20:44,413
I'll have the fish cake to go too.
Make sure to keep it warm.

366
00:20:44,413 --> 00:20:45,443
Okay.

367
00:20:49,622 --> 00:20:50,622
Jin Gu.

368
00:20:51,322 --> 00:20:52,453
What's all this?

369
00:20:52,592 --> 00:20:56,292
Our main investor, CEO Gong Jin Dan
of Angel Investment...

370
00:20:56,292 --> 00:20:58,322
sent us a hotel-style food truck.

371
00:21:04,562 --> 00:21:05,663
Did you buy a lot?

372
00:21:08,003 --> 00:21:09,003
What?

373
00:21:19,683 --> 00:21:20,713
What's going on?

374
00:21:20,983 --> 00:21:23,852
CEO Gong Jin Dan is here
to watch the shoot?

375
00:21:24,153 --> 00:21:25,453
Hello, Mr. Gong.

376
00:21:25,923 --> 00:21:27,322
Hello, Ms. Park.

377
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:30,062
I sent a food truck
to support you on set,

378
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,493
and I wanted to see
if everything was all right.

379
00:21:32,862 --> 00:21:34,493
I thought I should
support you in person too.

380
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:37,233
Everyone was excited
to see the food truck.

381
00:21:37,632 --> 00:21:40,602
Thank you so much
for your kind gesture, Mr. Gong.

382
00:21:40,773 --> 00:21:43,943
Thanks to you, we will be able
to finish it well today.

383
00:21:44,642 --> 00:21:45,842
Oh, right.

384
00:21:47,243 --> 00:21:48,312
Director Hong...

385
00:21:51,312 --> 00:21:53,753
Hey, hurry and go somewhere else.

386
00:21:54,013 --> 00:21:55,013
Just go.

387
00:21:56,509 --> 00:21:57,779
Try this shrimp.

388
00:21:58,418 --> 00:21:59,718
- Okay.
- It's good.

389
00:22:07,128 --> 00:22:08,458
It tastes really good.

390
00:22:09,158 --> 00:22:10,428
Please have some, Mr. Gong.

391
00:22:11,198 --> 00:22:14,228
Is it because
the chefs freshly cooked this here?

392
00:22:14,228 --> 00:22:16,698
It's so tender and tasty.

393
00:22:16,698 --> 00:22:18,539
I'm glad you like the food.

394
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:20,708
Please enjoy it
and keep up the good work.

395
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:22,408
Of course. We'll try our best.

396
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,319
Oh, dear.

397
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,549
Try some of this.

398
00:22:42,888 --> 00:22:44,228
Thank you, Jae Dong.

399
00:22:45,329 --> 00:22:46,329
Gosh.

400
00:22:47,468 --> 00:22:50,668
But, Jae Dong,
I don't need any of this.

401
00:22:50,668 --> 00:22:52,599
Just put in a good word
for me with Ms. Park.

402
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:54,468
Don't expect that to happen.

403
00:22:54,468 --> 00:22:57,178
Once Do Ra gets mad,
she holds grudges for long.

404
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:01,249
And you should go somewhere...

405
00:23:01,249 --> 00:23:03,178
where Do Ra can't find you.

406
00:23:03,178 --> 00:23:04,749
Like under the truck.

407
00:23:04,749 --> 00:23:06,619
Do Ra might want
to throw away your food.

408
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:08,049
Okay?

409
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,559
(We wish the success
of "Straightforward Romance.")

410
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:27,839
(We wish the success
of "Straightforward Romance.")

411
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,109
Mr. Gong.

412
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:32,438
I appreciate everything
you've done for our drama.

413
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,749
But I feel bad that I didn't
get you anything though.

414
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:37,418
I'm a little embarrassed,

415
00:23:37,418 --> 00:23:39,279
and I'm not sure if this is okay.

416
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:40,448
What do you mean
you didn't get me anything?

417
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:43,958
You're trying your best
as the lead role of the drama.

418
00:23:44,688 --> 00:23:45,688
And...

419
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,928
I really like this tie you got me.

420
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:52,599
Pardon?

421
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:55,228
A tie? What are you talking about?

422
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:58,999
This tie. I was told...

423
00:24:00,198 --> 00:24:02,809
you picked this for me.

424
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:05,079
I did?

425
00:24:06,908 --> 00:24:09,779
Mi Ja, I received
the interest for this month.

426
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:12,148
It's nice
that you kept your promise.

427
00:24:12,148 --> 00:24:15,448
You didn't have to call me.
I just did what I was supposed to do.

428
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:18,319
I'm just grateful
that you sent the money on time.

429
00:24:18,918 --> 00:24:21,658
I expect you
to do the same next month.

430
00:24:21,658 --> 00:24:25,499
I told you not to worry
about the interest I owe.

431
00:24:26,329 --> 00:24:29,168
Of course. I'm not worried at all.

432
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:31,539
Anyway, have a good day.

433
00:24:31,869 --> 00:24:32,968
Sure.

434
00:24:36,238 --> 00:24:38,138
I paid the largest amount
of interest I owed...

435
00:24:38,408 --> 00:24:40,448
and returned the money
I borrowed from Ms. Song.

436
00:24:40,678 --> 00:24:42,809
I also paid Ms. Ma back,

437
00:24:42,809 --> 00:24:44,819
so I guess I'm set for the month.

438
00:24:45,218 --> 00:24:46,718
Darn it.

439
00:24:47,148 --> 00:24:49,119
Receiving Do Ra's payment
for her series in advance...

440
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:50,688
put out the fire for now,

441
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,289
but what am I going
to do next month?

442
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,589
Gosh.

443
00:24:53,728 --> 00:24:55,888
How did I get myself into this mess?

444
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,968
Mr. Gong sent a food truck
for the entire crew,

445
00:25:05,968 --> 00:25:07,069
and it was a top-class buffet.

446
00:25:07,369 --> 00:25:08,468
My gosh.

447
00:25:08,938 --> 00:25:11,579
He operates on a scale
like no other.

448
00:25:12,509 --> 00:25:15,749
I knew it. He has a crush on Do Ra.

449
00:25:18,948 --> 00:25:19,978
That's right.

450
00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:22,519
He's the one
that'll dig me out of my mess.

451
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:25,488
Once he and Do Ra
end up as a couple,

452
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:27,658
my debt won't be a problem for me.

453
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:33,999
Hey, Do Ra.

454
00:25:34,428 --> 00:25:37,339
Yes, I saw the photos of the buffet
that Mr. Gong sent your way.

455
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:40,069
It was like he warped
a hotel buffet over there.

456
00:25:40,069 --> 00:25:43,668
You need to thank him
for his generosity.

457
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:46,039
Say you'll treat him to dinner.

458
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:49,749
Mom, it's about the necktie
you got for Mr. Gong.

459
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:51,448
Did you say I picked it out?

460
00:25:52,178 --> 00:25:54,218
Why would you lie to him about that?

461
00:25:54,218 --> 00:25:55,319
The necktie?

462
00:25:55,718 --> 00:25:57,488
Did you correct him by any chance?

463
00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:00,119
How could I say I picked it out
when I knew nothing about it?

464
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:03,289
You should've taken the hint
and played along.

465
00:26:03,289 --> 00:26:05,029
How can you be this daft?

466
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:07,198
Hello?

467
00:26:08,069 --> 00:26:10,128
What a brat. She just hung up on me.

468
00:26:10,938 --> 00:26:11,938
Oh, dear.

469
00:26:12,269 --> 00:26:15,869
What if he ends up
being disappointed with me?

470
00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:25,148
Mr. Gong.

471
00:26:25,718 --> 00:26:27,849
The necktie I got you the other day.

472
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,849
I'm sorry I lied...

473
00:26:29,849 --> 00:26:32,488
about Do Ra picking it out herself.

474
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:34,958
Right.

475
00:26:35,988 --> 00:26:37,428
Is that why you wanted to see me?

476
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:41,299
I was so impressed by you...

477
00:26:41,329 --> 00:26:44,839
that I lied in hopes
of you and Do Ra getting closer.

478
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,999
If I'm being honest,

479
00:26:46,999 --> 00:26:51,079
you do seem a little interested
in my Do Ra.

480
00:26:55,309 --> 00:26:59,349
Do you really want me
to have a relationship with her?

481
00:26:59,349 --> 00:27:00,789
Of course.

482
00:27:01,049 --> 00:27:03,218
I picked the necktie out myself,

483
00:27:03,218 --> 00:27:05,488
but my deepest wishes
went into the process...

484
00:27:05,488 --> 00:27:07,759
of choosing it for you.

485
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:10,188
Ms. Baek.

486
00:27:10,658 --> 00:27:11,728
I mean, Mother.

487
00:27:12,658 --> 00:27:15,069
Help me get together with Ms. Park.

488
00:27:16,128 --> 00:27:18,938
You were right to assume
that I have feelings for her.

489
00:27:19,398 --> 00:27:20,398
Goodness.

490
00:27:21,738 --> 00:27:23,039
Is that true, Mr. Gong?

491
00:27:24,138 --> 00:27:25,138
Gosh.

492
00:27:26,438 --> 00:27:28,049
Mr. Gong!

493
00:27:32,249 --> 00:27:35,249
My gosh. I can't believe it.

494
00:27:35,349 --> 00:27:36,589
Goodness me.

495
00:27:38,619 --> 00:27:41,228
Gosh, look at my glowing skin.

496
00:27:41,589 --> 00:27:43,999
It must be due
to my recent skincare routine.

497
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:46,029
Anyway, the makeup
is sticking like glue.

498
00:27:48,829 --> 00:27:50,499
Gosh, what the...

499
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:53,168
My gosh. What is this?

500
00:27:53,168 --> 00:27:54,938
What on earth is this?

501
00:27:54,938 --> 00:27:57,908
Goodness me.

502
00:27:58,579 --> 00:28:00,138
Wait, this is gum.

503
00:28:02,648 --> 00:28:05,319
In here. Ms. Yeoju!

504
00:28:06,448 --> 00:28:07,519
Yes?

505
00:28:08,049 --> 00:28:09,849
My gosh.

506
00:28:10,049 --> 00:28:12,619
What's wrong, Ms. Hong?

507
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:16,289
Gosh, what is it? What's wrong?

508
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:19,299
Auntie, look at this.

509
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:21,499
- My gosh.
- What is that?

510
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:24,039
It looks like gum.

511
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:26,438
Who on earth would chew
this much gum?

512
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:29,168
Who could've done this?

513
00:28:29,238 --> 00:28:31,938
Who else in this family
would do such a thing?

514
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:34,609
Gong Ma Ri!

515
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:36,079
Gong Ma Ri.

516
00:28:37,448 --> 00:28:40,619
Did you really stick gum
on your grandmother's chair?

517
00:28:43,148 --> 00:28:44,158
Yes.

518
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:48,759
Why?

519
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:52,099
Why did you do that?

520
00:28:54,128 --> 00:28:57,468
Because the Mistress Grandma Hong
was stressing my mom out...

521
00:28:57,738 --> 00:28:59,138
by calling her "daughter-in-law."

522
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:02,138
Put yourself in my mom's shoes.

523
00:29:02,238 --> 00:29:03,238
How would it feel to be forced...

524
00:29:03,238 --> 00:29:04,279
to call your friend
your mother-in-law...

525
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:07,079
while she calls you
her daughter-in-law?

526
00:29:07,708 --> 00:29:10,609
I'd be sick to my stomach.

527
00:29:11,019 --> 00:29:13,988
My gosh. I never forced her.

528
00:29:14,688 --> 00:29:17,119
Ma Ri, that doesn't
give you the right...

529
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:18,119
to upset your elder this way.

530
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:19,958
She's right, Ma Ri.

531
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,529
You're too old for pranks like this.

532
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:23,829
That's enough.

533
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:27,198
There's no point in telling off
a mentally impaired child.

534
00:29:27,428 --> 00:29:29,928
Great Auntie, I'm not a fool.

535
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:31,698
Don't treat me as one.

536
00:29:32,698 --> 00:29:33,698
What?

537
00:29:34,238 --> 00:29:37,609
Also, Mistress Grandma Hong,
don't bully my mom again.

538
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,678
I can forgive everything else,

539
00:29:39,678 --> 00:29:41,408
but not you
making her life miserable.

540
00:29:41,708 --> 00:29:42,948
Do that again,

541
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:45,978
and I'll smear superglue
on your chair instead of gum...

542
00:29:45,978 --> 00:29:48,289
so that your butt
sticks to it forever.

543
00:29:48,589 --> 00:29:49,789
Ma Ri!

544
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:51,218
Goodness.

545
00:29:53,888 --> 00:29:55,329
Oh, dear.

546
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:57,658
My gosh.

547
00:30:02,829 --> 00:30:03,869
Goodness.

548
00:30:05,168 --> 00:30:07,539
What could your plans be
for the future?

549
00:30:09,168 --> 00:30:11,678
Thinking about our family
and the company...

550
00:30:11,779 --> 00:30:13,839
keeps me up at night.

551
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:17,749
Auntie, please don't worry.

552
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,749
I have thoughts
on how to handle the matter.

553
00:30:20,948 --> 00:30:22,119
Is that so?

554
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:24,188
Do tell, then.
I'd love to hear about them.

555
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:26,819
She only needs
to marry a decent man.

556
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:28,728
I've been looking...

557
00:30:29,859 --> 00:30:32,658
for a decent man
who'll be a good fit for the family.

558
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:35,869
What did you just say? A son-in-law?

559
00:30:36,829 --> 00:30:40,238
Are you saying
you'd give away the company...

560
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:42,168
that has been in our family
for three generations...

561
00:30:42,869 --> 00:30:45,178
to someone with a different surname?

562
00:30:46,509 --> 00:30:48,148
How can you even say that?

563
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:50,448
What's so wrong about that?

564
00:30:50,978 --> 00:30:53,249
Ma Ri will marry
and have children of her own.

565
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,249
Then, all will be settled.

566
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:56,319
So?

567
00:30:56,648 --> 00:30:59,888
Will Ma Ri's children
have Gong for their surname?

568
00:31:00,019 --> 00:31:02,988
Ma Ri's children
are as good as mine.

569
00:31:03,658 --> 00:31:04,728
What?

570
00:31:06,329 --> 00:31:09,228
Until she marries and has children,

571
00:31:09,829 --> 00:31:11,238
and they grow up...

572
00:31:11,638 --> 00:31:13,898
to inherit the company,

573
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:16,869
I will continue to run it
in good health,

574
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:19,579
so don't worry too much.

575
00:31:21,249 --> 00:31:22,948
Anyway, I have a meeting to get to.

576
00:31:22,948 --> 00:31:25,549
I'll head to the office and be back.

577
00:31:26,948 --> 00:31:27,948
Right.

578
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:30,958
What was that?

579
00:31:31,888 --> 00:31:32,988
A son-in-law?

580
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,289
What kind of nonsense is that?

581
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:38,329
My gosh.

582
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:44,569
- Hyun Chul.
- Hey, Mom.

583
00:31:44,898 --> 00:31:46,438
What is this about?

584
00:31:46,499 --> 00:31:48,138
Why did you ask to see me outside?

585
00:31:48,138 --> 00:31:49,369
Did something go wrong?

586
00:31:50,738 --> 00:31:53,279
I feel like my heart
will stop beating at any second.

587
00:31:53,309 --> 00:31:55,109
As if it would've gone wrong.

588
00:31:55,109 --> 00:31:56,378
Let me show you.

589
00:31:57,009 --> 00:32:01,619
Myung Soo wired 1,000 dollars
in dividends.

590
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:04,958
Goodness me.
1,000 dollars in dividends?

591
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:05,958
That's right.

592
00:32:06,019 --> 00:32:08,388
This time around,
the investment is solid.

593
00:32:08,829 --> 00:32:11,799
You only invested 50,000 dollars
a few days ago,

594
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:13,799
but you already got
1,000 dollars in return?

595
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:14,829
That's right.

596
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:18,638
You said the used phone business...

597
00:32:18,668 --> 00:32:20,569
was a blue ocean in Vietnam,

598
00:32:21,309 --> 00:32:23,408
and I guess you were right.

599
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:25,809
I said it was solid
this time around.

600
00:32:25,809 --> 00:32:26,978
Goodness.

601
00:32:27,849 --> 00:32:30,749
If you had 100,000 dollars,
you would've earned 2,000 dollars.

602
00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:33,249
- Right.
- What a shame.

603
00:32:33,249 --> 00:32:35,388
I should've gotten
100,000 dollars...

604
00:32:35,388 --> 00:32:37,519
from that minx at all costs.

605
00:32:38,819 --> 00:32:41,658
Mom, Sun Young will throw a fit...

606
00:32:41,658 --> 00:32:43,259
if she finds out about this money,

607
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:45,329
so let's not get greedy.

608
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,499
Sure. You're absolutely right.

609
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:54,509
Gosh, check out the color on these.

610
00:32:55,769 --> 00:32:58,839
They're so good.

611
00:33:01,378 --> 00:33:02,408
Here.

612
00:33:03,009 --> 00:33:04,009
Right.

613
00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:07,249
- It's good.
- All right.

614
00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:11,359
This has been grilled to perfection.

615
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:13,019
Here you go. Open wide.

616
00:33:15,388 --> 00:33:16,859
How is it, my lady?

617
00:33:17,928 --> 00:33:20,529
- Need I say more? It's delicious.
- Right?

618
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:23,869
It melts in your mouth
with it being tenderloin.

619
00:33:25,438 --> 00:33:28,938
Gosh. Am I invisible to you?

620
00:33:28,938 --> 00:33:33,178
Goodness. Here you go, Queen Mother.

621
00:33:34,249 --> 00:33:36,049
One must ask how it is.

622
00:33:39,218 --> 00:33:40,249
Gosh.

623
00:33:41,749 --> 00:33:44,458
It must be because my son bought it
with the money he earned,

624
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:46,458
but this is absolutely delicious.

625
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,529
- Right?
- Myung Dong.

626
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:50,999
Eat up as well.

627
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:52,428
Here.

628
00:33:52,428 --> 00:33:53,958
- I've been doing just that.
- Go ahead.

629
00:33:53,958 --> 00:33:55,299
Here.

630
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:58,668
You've been leaving the house
in a suit for days now.

631
00:33:58,898 --> 00:34:00,539
Have you been working part-time?

632
00:34:01,238 --> 00:34:02,269
What?

633
00:34:02,738 --> 00:34:05,708
Yes, that's what I said.

634
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:08,648
How many times must you ask me that?

635
00:34:08,648 --> 00:34:11,119
I'm thrilled, that's all.

636
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:14,619
When was the last time
you brought home money...

637
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:15,948
that you actually earned?

638
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:19,559
It's also been a while
since you bought me a gift like this.

639
00:34:21,488 --> 00:34:23,888
You two are being silly,
if you ask me.

640
00:34:23,888 --> 00:34:25,198
Who wears scarves
while grilling meat...

641
00:34:25,198 --> 00:34:26,499
when it's only going
to make them smell?

642
00:34:26,829 --> 00:34:29,928
I don't mind if mine smells.

643
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:33,369
I won't take off the scarf
my son bought for me...

644
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:36,738
even when I go to bed at night.

645
00:34:36,738 --> 00:34:38,138
Same here.

646
00:34:40,709 --> 00:34:41,879
I'm home.

647
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:43,079
- Hey.
- Hey.

648
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:44,178
- My son.
- You're home.

649
00:34:44,178 --> 00:34:45,749
You're back. Join us for dinner.

650
00:34:45,749 --> 00:34:47,818
Pil Seung, get changed
and hurry back down.

651
00:34:47,818 --> 00:34:49,919
Your dad bought beef
for the family today.

652
00:34:51,488 --> 00:34:52,919
- Sure.
- Good.

653
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:54,289
Hurry back down, then.

654
00:35:09,769 --> 00:35:11,638
I'll get changed and head back down.

655
00:35:13,379 --> 00:35:15,709
Was Park Do Ra on your case again?

656
00:35:15,709 --> 00:35:16,809
Is that it?

657
00:35:18,448 --> 00:35:19,979
I can't let this slide.

658
00:35:19,979 --> 00:35:22,218
I'll have to meet her myself.

659
00:35:23,218 --> 00:35:24,218
Auntie,

660
00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:27,158
why would you meet her?

661
00:35:28,629 --> 00:35:30,988
Can you please turn a blind eye?

662
00:35:30,988 --> 00:35:32,899
I'm fine, okay? It's all right.

663
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,298
This isn't the face of someone
who looks fine.

664
00:35:37,939 --> 00:35:40,838
I was fuming about
what I saw earlier today...

665
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:42,408
that I couldn't tell...

666
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:44,809
if the beef was going through
my mouth or nose.

667
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,678
That's how distracted I've been.

668
00:35:48,178 --> 00:35:51,249
My blood boils when I think about
how Park Do Ra treated you.

669
00:35:51,879 --> 00:35:54,689
How dare she bite your head off
in front of all those people?

670
00:35:55,318 --> 00:35:56,818
So what if she's a top celebrity?

671
00:35:56,818 --> 00:35:58,658
Who is she to have you fired?

672
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:02,059
The fact that you've been
groveling at her feet...

673
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:04,059
taking this much crap from her...

674
00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:06,298
hurts my pride and ego.

675
00:36:08,329 --> 00:36:09,928
What on earth are you talking about?

676
00:36:12,638 --> 00:36:14,099
- Mom.
- Sun Young.

677
00:36:14,638 --> 00:36:17,669
What were you saying just now?

678
00:36:18,939 --> 00:36:20,008
Pil Seung.

679
00:36:20,408 --> 00:36:23,809
Have you been working
with Park Do Ra?

680
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,349
Myung Dong,

681
00:36:26,349 --> 00:36:29,048
you said Park Do Ra
was biting his head off.

682
00:36:29,689 --> 00:36:32,218
What on earth did I just hear?

683
00:36:32,388 --> 00:36:34,559
What in the world is all this?

684
00:36:35,329 --> 00:36:38,298
Ko Pil Seung,
tell me the truth this instant.

685
00:36:42,999 --> 00:36:44,129
Gosh.

686
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:45,798
Honey.

687
00:36:46,169 --> 00:36:49,809
Have some water and calm down.

688
00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:52,238
As if I could calm down right now.

689
00:36:52,439 --> 00:36:55,849
Park Do Ra, that brat,
has been biting our son's head off.

690
00:36:56,908 --> 00:37:00,019
Our son has been groveling
at her feet,

691
00:37:00,019 --> 00:37:01,849
has been humiliated by her,

692
00:37:01,849 --> 00:37:03,818
and is at her beck and call.

693
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:06,289
That came out wrong
on my part, Sun Young.

694
00:37:06,289 --> 00:37:08,028
He's not at her beck and call.

695
00:37:08,028 --> 00:37:10,959
Pil Seung, have you lost your mind?

696
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:14,928
How can you work with her
and let her humiliate you?

697
00:37:15,629 --> 00:37:16,669
You should've been against it...

698
00:37:16,669 --> 00:37:19,138
and you should've asked
to be moved to a different team.

699
00:37:19,568 --> 00:37:21,169
I wasn't going
to work on the show...

700
00:37:21,169 --> 00:37:23,039
when I first heard
Park Do Ra was the lead.

701
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:24,039
But...

702
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:26,678
I had no choice.

703
00:37:26,838 --> 00:37:29,249
Exactly.
That's how it is at the office.

704
00:37:29,249 --> 00:37:32,048
You do as you're told by your boss.

705
00:37:32,448 --> 00:37:36,019
How could he possibly ask
to be moved around...

706
00:37:36,019 --> 00:37:38,689
when he's basically a new recruit?

707
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:41,059
Absolutely. Yes, of course.

708
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:43,629
Still, it's a relief...

709
00:37:43,629 --> 00:37:47,459
that Park Do Ra
didn't recognize him.

710
00:37:47,758 --> 00:37:50,769
Hyun Chul, don't you agree?

711
00:37:51,028 --> 00:37:52,039
What?

712
00:37:52,468 --> 00:37:54,338
Oh, right.

713
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:56,568
This couldn't be more upsetting.

714
00:37:57,138 --> 00:38:00,079
Park Do Ra, how dare she?

715
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,209
Who is she to harass my son?

716
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:05,778
Goodness.

717
00:38:05,778 --> 00:38:06,778
Mom,

718
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:09,849
Do Ra doesn't know who I really am.

719
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:12,119
On set,

720
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:14,928
she's an A-list star
and I'm the rookie assistant director.

721
00:38:14,928 --> 00:38:16,258
However, I wronged her.

722
00:38:16,258 --> 00:38:18,858
So for what I did wrong,

723
00:38:18,858 --> 00:38:20,928
I should take responsibility
and handle the repercussions.

724
00:38:22,169 --> 00:38:25,369
Mom, Dad, Grandma, Auntie,

725
00:38:26,198 --> 00:38:27,399
don't worry too much.

726
00:38:28,908 --> 00:38:31,608
I'll handle it well, and I'm fine.

727
00:38:39,749 --> 00:38:42,548
Gosh, what on earth is all this?

728
00:38:42,548 --> 00:38:45,888
My head is killing me.

729
00:38:45,888 --> 00:38:47,959
He's right, Sun Young.

730
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:50,629
Come to think of it,
he's absolutely right.

731
00:38:50,629 --> 00:38:52,858
It's not like
he has control over what happens.

732
00:38:53,499 --> 00:38:56,528
Besides, they are done filming
half of the episodes,

733
00:38:56,528 --> 00:38:58,099
and things will be over soon.

734
00:38:58,099 --> 00:39:00,269
They won't run into each other again
once they wrap this up.

735
00:39:00,698 --> 00:39:02,068
Exactly.

736
00:39:02,068 --> 00:39:04,879
Pil Seung will handle everything.
Okay?

737
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:20,189
Do Ra.

738
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:22,658
I feel bad...

739
00:39:22,658 --> 00:39:24,899
for Assistant Director Ko.

740
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:27,658
He only did what he did
because he was told to do so.

741
00:39:27,658 --> 00:39:30,369
Keeping Cha Bong Soo in a good mood
would help filming go smoothly.

742
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:32,198
It's why he did it.

743
00:39:32,198 --> 00:39:35,338
I don't think he said those things
because he hates you.

744
00:39:35,968 --> 00:39:38,039
Don't mention him to me ever again.

745
00:39:38,638 --> 00:39:39,778
I don't want to hear it.

746
00:39:41,678 --> 00:39:44,178
Also, don't go around
talking to him anymore.

747
00:39:44,178 --> 00:39:45,278
Got it?

748
00:39:45,479 --> 00:39:47,718
Right. I get it, Do Ra.

749
00:39:54,858 --> 00:39:56,459
Do Ra, we're here.

750
00:40:03,269 --> 00:40:04,399
You should head home.

751
00:40:04,399 --> 00:40:07,039
What? But you'll be drinking.

752
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:08,039
I'll wait for you.

753
00:40:08,209 --> 00:40:10,209
It's fine. You can go.

754
00:40:10,209 --> 00:40:11,939
It's your mom's birthday today.

755
00:40:12,908 --> 00:40:15,008
Her gift is in the back.
Make sure she gets it.

756
00:40:16,448 --> 00:40:17,448
Off you go.

757
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:32,629
But...

758
00:40:34,669 --> 00:40:37,028
Ms. Baek, it's Jae Dong.

759
00:40:48,227 --> 00:40:50,798
But putting up with her
isn't a stroll in the park.

760
00:40:50,798 --> 00:40:53,098
I now get
why people call her Snark Do Ra.

761
00:40:53,098 --> 00:40:55,238
I lose my mind
dozens of times a day!

762
00:40:55,238 --> 00:40:58,468
I wanted to somehow
complete the shoot...

763
00:40:59,238 --> 00:41:01,707
How dare you play games with me?

764
00:41:03,848 --> 00:41:06,548
You traitor. You lowlife.

765
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:08,618
No one can be trusted in this world.

766
00:41:16,088 --> 00:41:17,488
Aren't you Park Do Ra?

767
00:41:22,997 --> 00:41:24,598
- That's me.
- Wait.

768
00:41:25,227 --> 00:41:26,598
It really is you.

769
00:41:27,167 --> 00:41:29,138
I can't believe I ran into you here.

770
00:41:29,508 --> 00:41:30,568
What a coincidence.

771
00:41:30,568 --> 00:41:31,868
Mr. Gong, my gosh.

772
00:41:32,678 --> 00:41:34,437
What brings you here?

773
00:41:34,437 --> 00:41:35,977
It's one of the places I come to...

774
00:41:35,977 --> 00:41:37,548
when I wish to drink alone
after work.

775
00:41:39,147 --> 00:41:41,048
Same here.

776
00:41:41,048 --> 00:41:43,088
I love how quiet
and private this place is,

777
00:41:43,088 --> 00:41:45,588
so I come here
when I wish to have drinks.

778
00:41:45,588 --> 00:41:46,658
Gosh.

779
00:41:47,557 --> 00:41:49,727
This is fascinating though.

780
00:41:49,727 --> 00:41:51,488
I can't believe I met you here.

781
00:41:51,857 --> 00:41:54,057
Are you here alone? As am I.

782
00:41:54,327 --> 00:41:55,497
Why don't we drink together...

783
00:41:55,497 --> 00:41:56,667
since it's not every day
we cross paths like this?

784
00:41:56,667 --> 00:41:57,727
I'd love that.

785
00:41:57,727 --> 00:42:01,098
You've been so generous to me...

786
00:42:01,098 --> 00:42:03,238
that I've been meaning
to buy you drinks.

787
00:42:03,738 --> 00:42:05,107
Drinks will be on me today.

788
00:42:06,307 --> 00:42:07,437
Really?

789
00:42:08,008 --> 00:42:09,948
Gosh, what an honor.

790
00:42:11,207 --> 00:42:12,917
Let's drink.

791
00:42:14,118 --> 00:42:15,577
Cheers.

792
00:42:15,877 --> 00:42:16,888
Cheers.

793
00:42:26,758 --> 00:42:29,468
Please slow down.
You already seem pretty tipsy.

794
00:42:30,897 --> 00:42:32,368
It's fine.

795
00:42:32,368 --> 00:42:34,437
We drink to get drunk, don't we?

796
00:42:36,767 --> 00:42:38,937
There are days we wish to be drunk.

797
00:42:39,607 --> 00:42:41,877
You want the alcohol
to wash everything away.

798
00:42:43,247 --> 00:42:45,107
Aren't there days like that
for you as well?

799
00:42:45,877 --> 00:42:47,077
Of course there are.

800
00:42:47,877 --> 00:42:50,287
We all have such days, don't we?

801
00:42:51,287 --> 00:42:52,917
I checked the filming schedule,

802
00:42:52,917 --> 00:42:55,218
and things are tight
with filming almost being over.

803
00:42:55,988 --> 00:42:57,127
You must be exhausted.

804
00:43:00,997 --> 00:43:02,397
It's never the work that's hard.

805
00:43:03,167 --> 00:43:04,598
It's the people around me.

806
00:43:05,497 --> 00:43:06,537
The people?

807
00:43:07,698 --> 00:43:08,767
People?

808
00:43:10,107 --> 00:43:11,667
Has someone been making
your life miserable?

809
00:43:12,267 --> 00:43:14,977
Who is it? I'll knock some sense
into whoever that is.

810
00:43:17,077 --> 00:43:18,877
- Really?
- Of course.

811
00:43:18,877 --> 00:43:21,278
You bet. I'm always your fan.

812
00:43:21,678 --> 00:43:23,448
If anyone bothers you, tell me.

813
00:43:23,448 --> 00:43:24,488
I'll...

814
00:43:25,417 --> 00:43:26,417
sort it out for you.

815
00:43:26,417 --> 00:43:27,557
Gosh.

816
00:43:29,287 --> 00:43:31,428
Mr. Gong, how sweet of you.

817
00:43:32,827 --> 00:43:34,997
Thanks so much for the sentiment.

818
00:43:36,167 --> 00:43:37,227
You're awesome.

819
00:43:38,568 --> 00:43:39,568
Awesome?

820
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,307
What is wrong with you?

821
00:43:56,448 --> 00:43:57,488
Yes.

822
00:43:59,417 --> 00:44:01,318
Let's beg until Do Ra feels better.

823
00:44:02,618 --> 00:44:03,928
Let's go on my knees.

824
00:44:05,457 --> 00:44:06,857
I'm in the wrong.

825
00:44:25,908 --> 00:44:27,424
(Ms. Park Do Ra)

826
00:44:37,677 --> 00:44:39,547
This is where I live.

827
00:44:40,007 --> 00:44:41,208
When did we arrive?

828
00:44:41,957 --> 00:44:43,057
Just now.

829
00:44:43,756 --> 00:44:45,897
Let's go. I'll walk you to the door.

830
00:44:45,897 --> 00:44:49,426
No. I can get home myself.

831
00:44:50,367 --> 00:44:51,836
Thank you for the ride.

832
00:44:52,466 --> 00:44:53,767
Hey.

833
00:44:54,207 --> 00:44:56,307
Look. You almost fell down.

834
00:44:56,807 --> 00:45:00,307
I'll get you into the elevator.

835
00:45:00,676 --> 00:45:04,877
You're so kind, Mr. Gong.

836
00:45:06,187 --> 00:45:09,147
Thank you so much.

837
00:45:10,386 --> 00:45:12,716
It's not a nuisance at all.

838
00:45:12,716 --> 00:45:14,756
- Let's go inside.
- Wait.

839
00:45:14,756 --> 00:45:17,296
I think I need to do something.

840
00:45:18,426 --> 00:45:19,727
Okay.

841
00:45:24,437 --> 00:45:26,136
Mr. Gong's not drunk at all,

842
00:45:27,236 --> 00:45:29,606
but why did Do Ra drink so much?

843
00:45:31,577 --> 00:45:33,406
We can't talk tonight, then.

844
00:45:37,347 --> 00:45:38,647
Hey, Yoon Hee.

845
00:45:41,647 --> 00:45:42,687
What?

846
00:45:44,586 --> 00:45:45,816
You're at that hotel?

847
00:45:47,356 --> 00:45:50,127
Okay. I'll be right there.
Wait for me.

848
00:45:58,466 --> 00:45:59,937
He must have a girlfriend.

849
00:46:04,537 --> 00:46:06,577
If he has a girlfriend,
what was he thinking...

850
00:46:07,707 --> 00:46:10,747
that he accompanied Do Ra until now
and got her so drunk?

851
00:46:17,187 --> 00:46:18,256
What is this?

852
00:46:18,886 --> 00:46:22,386
Will you take it and break up
or leave it and break up?

853
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:32,236
Thanks.

854
00:46:32,497 --> 00:46:34,966
I should thank you too.

855
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,207
I hope you really live happily.

856
00:46:39,006 --> 00:46:40,207
Don't call me again.

857
00:46:51,886 --> 00:46:53,356
I'm home, honey.

858
00:46:53,526 --> 00:46:54,926
Hello, darling.

859
00:46:56,227 --> 00:46:57,457
What's that?

860
00:46:57,627 --> 00:46:58,627
This?

861
00:46:59,356 --> 00:47:01,196
Your physical results
got me worried,

862
00:47:01,867 --> 00:47:03,597
so I got something for you.

863
00:47:05,037 --> 00:47:07,037
You should take supplements now.

864
00:47:07,267 --> 00:47:10,506
Be sure to take this regularly,

865
00:47:10,906 --> 00:47:13,077
and be careful so you don't trip up.

866
00:47:13,477 --> 00:47:14,546
Goodness.

867
00:47:14,546 --> 00:47:16,446
Okay, thanks.

868
00:47:16,847 --> 00:47:19,147
- I'll take this regularly.
- Please do.

869
00:47:22,617 --> 00:47:25,287
By the way, your friend's son.

870
00:47:25,287 --> 00:47:27,856
Your friend Sun Young's son.

871
00:47:28,057 --> 00:47:30,397
Did you say his name is Pil Seung?

872
00:47:31,756 --> 00:47:32,756
Oh, dear.

873
00:47:33,796 --> 00:47:36,437
What's wrong? Are you okay?

874
00:47:37,196 --> 00:47:39,136
Yes, I'm fine.

875
00:47:39,296 --> 00:47:40,537
The bottle slipped out of my hand.

876
00:47:42,736 --> 00:47:43,776
So,

877
00:47:44,377 --> 00:47:46,977
why are you
asking about Sun Young's son?

878
00:47:46,977 --> 00:47:48,776
You got his name right.
It's Ko Pil Seung.

879
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:52,816
He suddenly came to mind.

880
00:47:53,716 --> 00:47:55,046
When I saw him last time,

881
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:58,187
I thought he looked quite reliable.

882
00:48:00,327 --> 00:48:02,727
If our Ma Ri had a brother like him,

883
00:48:04,127 --> 00:48:07,867
how reassuring would that be?
I found myself thinking.

884
00:48:09,997 --> 00:48:12,196
You can be so silly.

885
00:48:13,106 --> 00:48:14,167
I can be, right?

886
00:48:14,636 --> 00:48:15,736
I'll get changed.

887
00:48:34,127 --> 00:48:36,827
Why did he
suddenly mention Pil Seung?

888
00:48:38,196 --> 00:48:40,827
Why does he wish
Ma Ri had a brother like him?

889
00:48:41,466 --> 00:48:43,167
What does that mean?

890
00:48:44,966 --> 00:48:46,037
Is it...

891
00:49:04,457 --> 00:49:05,586
Have you gone senile?

892
00:49:05,586 --> 00:49:07,687
There's a huge age gap between us.

893
00:49:07,687 --> 00:49:09,586
Did you lend me the money
to seduce me?

894
00:49:09,586 --> 00:49:12,057
I'll sell my body to pay you back!

895
00:49:12,057 --> 00:49:14,526
Don't you try to pawn off
a smelly old man to me.

896
00:49:14,526 --> 00:49:17,066
You can't just say
whatever you want!

897
00:49:17,566 --> 00:49:18,796
Father.

898
00:49:19,267 --> 00:49:21,906
Dad. Don't die.

899
00:49:22,367 --> 00:49:25,207
- Don't die, Dad.
- Honey.

900
00:49:25,207 --> 00:49:27,546
- What's wrong?
- Dad!

901
00:49:27,546 --> 00:49:28,546
Honey.

902
00:49:31,077 --> 00:49:32,147
Dad.

903
00:49:34,586 --> 00:49:36,656
My poor dad.

904
00:49:38,316 --> 00:49:41,457
I feel so sorry for my poor dad.

905
00:49:43,497 --> 00:49:44,557
Honey.

906
00:49:46,867 --> 00:49:47,997
Calm down.

907
00:49:48,867 --> 00:49:51,097
You dreamed about your father.

908
00:49:51,667 --> 00:49:53,406
Relax.

909
00:49:54,906 --> 00:49:56,406
That darn family.

910
00:49:56,707 --> 00:49:59,537
I never wanted to
think about them again.

911
00:50:00,446 --> 00:50:02,606
I wouldn't feel better even if...

912
00:50:02,606 --> 00:50:06,316
I got to pull out
all of Baek Mi Ja's hair.

913
00:50:07,847 --> 00:50:10,986
That's why I changed the channel
whenever Do Ra came on.

914
00:50:11,917 --> 00:50:15,526
Seeing Do Ra reminded me of her mom.

915
00:50:17,127 --> 00:50:19,597
What does that darn family...

916
00:50:19,597 --> 00:50:22,497
have to do with us now?

917
00:50:22,627 --> 00:50:25,796
Why does our Pil Seung have to be...

918
00:50:25,796 --> 00:50:28,066
treated like that
by the witch's daughter?

919
00:50:28,867 --> 00:50:31,276
They should beg us for forgiveness.

920
00:50:31,437 --> 00:50:34,006
How dare Do Ra
treat Pil Seung like that?

921
00:50:47,457 --> 00:50:48,557
She's still...

922
00:50:49,187 --> 00:50:51,156
so heartbroken.

923
00:50:54,497 --> 00:50:56,667
I can't let her
know about the money.

924
00:51:00,037 --> 00:51:01,167
What should I do?

925
00:51:13,176 --> 00:51:14,247
Pil Seung.

926
00:51:15,586 --> 00:51:18,816
Don't think of anything else.
Just work hard at the TV station.

927
00:51:21,386 --> 00:51:24,526
You studied so hard
to get a job there.

928
00:51:25,227 --> 00:51:27,696
You got in
because you wanted to make...

929
00:51:27,696 --> 00:51:29,097
some fun dramas.

930
00:51:30,066 --> 00:51:33,267
Fortunately for us,
Do Ra doesn't know who you are.

931
00:51:33,667 --> 00:51:35,437
Even if it's tough, hang in there.

932
00:51:35,707 --> 00:51:38,276
Yes. You said the right thing.

933
00:51:38,276 --> 00:51:41,977
But if Park Do Ra
gives you a hard time again,

934
00:51:42,446 --> 00:51:44,446
just tell her who you are.

935
00:51:44,917 --> 00:51:47,847
She won't dare challenge you
once she knows you're Ko Dae Chung.

936
00:51:48,946 --> 00:51:52,216
Just expose what Do Ra's mom did.

937
00:51:52,216 --> 00:51:53,216
Okay?

938
00:51:55,156 --> 00:51:58,926
Hey, Sun Young.
Why would you say that?

939
00:51:59,356 --> 00:52:01,066
Do Ra didn't do anything wrong.

940
00:52:01,066 --> 00:52:02,526
Her mom did.

941
00:52:03,897 --> 00:52:05,836
Hyun Chul. Isn't that right?

942
00:52:06,336 --> 00:52:08,336
Yes. Well...

943
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:10,477
Why would you go that far?

944
00:52:11,836 --> 00:52:15,546
Okay. I'll take care of it.
Don't you worry.

945
00:52:16,847 --> 00:52:19,477
I served in
the specialized search troops.

946
00:52:19,747 --> 00:52:20,747
Victory!

947
00:52:22,187 --> 00:52:24,386
- You're so cute.
- Okay.

948
00:52:24,386 --> 00:52:26,086
- Victory.
- Victory.

949
00:52:27,057 --> 00:52:29,026
- Well done, son.
- Don't worry.

950
00:52:29,386 --> 00:52:30,856
- Thanks.
- Bye.

951
00:52:34,397 --> 00:52:35,926
- Do Ra.
- What?

952
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:38,867
Who sent them?

953
00:52:38,867 --> 00:52:41,667
Gong Jin Dan sent them to you.

954
00:52:42,136 --> 00:52:44,037
- Mr. Gong?
- Yes.

955
00:52:53,417 --> 00:52:55,316
Ms. Park. Do you feel okay?

956
00:52:55,816 --> 00:52:58,517
I hope these flowers
cheer you up and give you energy.

957
00:52:58,886 --> 00:53:01,057
Have a nice day. From Gong Jin Dan.

958
00:53:01,787 --> 00:53:04,457
How does he know
you had a drink last night?

959
00:53:05,057 --> 00:53:06,426
Did he accompany you?

960
00:53:06,557 --> 00:53:09,727
Yes. We happened to meet at the bar.

961
00:53:10,997 --> 00:53:12,066
You happened to?

962
00:53:15,307 --> 00:53:16,506
They're so pretty.

963
00:53:16,606 --> 00:53:18,276
- Your phone's ringing.
- What?

964
00:53:19,006 --> 00:53:20,046
Take this.

965
00:53:23,147 --> 00:53:24,676
Hello, Mr. Gong.

966
00:53:24,676 --> 00:53:27,546
Yes. I was going to give you a call.

967
00:53:27,946 --> 00:53:29,586
Thank you for the flowers.

968
00:53:29,886 --> 00:53:31,316
I want you to have a good day.

969
00:53:32,187 --> 00:53:35,156
I feel bad to always be
on the receiving end.

970
00:53:35,156 --> 00:53:36,426
I owe you for yesterday.

971
00:53:36,696 --> 00:53:38,696
Treat me to a meal next time, then.

972
00:53:38,827 --> 00:53:40,566
Of course, I will.

973
00:53:40,667 --> 00:53:41,926
Thank you.

974
00:53:42,526 --> 00:53:44,336
By the way,

975
00:53:44,336 --> 00:53:47,037
did I make any mistakes yesterday?

976
00:53:49,236 --> 00:53:50,236
What?

977
00:53:50,836 --> 00:53:52,676
My gosh. I did?

978
00:53:54,847 --> 00:53:56,506
Oh, no.

979
00:53:56,747 --> 00:53:57,747
Are you serious?

980
00:54:00,316 --> 00:54:02,787
- What makes her so happy?
- Yes. That's horrible.

981
00:54:03,787 --> 00:54:05,457
CEO Gong Jin Dan...

982
00:54:05,457 --> 00:54:07,457
sent a hotel-style
food truck yesterday,

983
00:54:07,457 --> 00:54:08,727
and a flower bouquet today.

984
00:54:09,127 --> 00:54:11,397
Isn't it obvious
that he's flirting with her?

985
00:54:12,526 --> 00:54:14,497
And Do Ra seems
to be falling for that...

986
00:54:14,497 --> 00:54:16,597
since Mr. Gong is
rich and assertive.

987
00:54:17,566 --> 00:54:19,937
Actually, most women
would fall for a man...

988
00:54:19,937 --> 00:54:21,906
like CEO Gong Jin Dan.

989
00:54:22,506 --> 00:54:25,077
He has a reputation
as a womanizer though.

990
00:54:27,176 --> 00:54:28,247
A womanizer?

991
00:54:29,647 --> 00:54:30,816
Did you not know?

992
00:54:30,816 --> 00:54:33,316
He's known
to go after new actresses.

993
00:54:33,647 --> 00:54:36,287
Whenever he sees
a new actress that looks pretty,

994
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:38,057
he showers TV commercials
and gifts on her...

995
00:54:38,057 --> 00:54:39,417
to win her heart.

996
00:54:39,886 --> 00:54:41,386
Then he breaks up
with her before long,

997
00:54:41,386 --> 00:54:43,897
and she weeps and wails
because of that.

998
00:54:43,997 --> 00:54:46,426
He has a reputation
for being a born womanizer.

999
00:54:47,526 --> 00:54:50,066
What if Do Ra falls for him...

1000
00:54:50,066 --> 00:54:52,566
and ends up with a broken heart?

1001
00:54:53,367 --> 00:54:55,236
Forget it.

1002
00:54:55,767 --> 00:54:57,437
Why do I even bother?

1003
00:54:57,437 --> 00:54:59,937
It's not like
I'm Do Ra's brother or uncle.

1004
00:55:00,247 --> 00:55:02,406
I don't care
if she dates Gong Jin Dan or not.

1005
00:55:02,406 --> 00:55:06,316
I just want her to get along
with Cha Bong Soo well...

1006
00:55:06,316 --> 00:55:07,816
until we finish this project.

1007
00:55:11,287 --> 00:55:12,716
Hey, Pil Seung.

1008
00:55:12,716 --> 00:55:15,227
Go over there
so Do Ra can't see you.

1009
00:55:15,256 --> 00:55:17,727
I don't want her
to make a fuss again,

1010
00:55:17,727 --> 00:55:19,756
saying she can't memorize her lines
because of you.

1011
00:55:20,097 --> 00:55:22,667
I just can't deal with it.
Hurry and go.

1012
00:55:23,636 --> 00:55:24,696
Just go.

1013
00:55:33,577 --> 00:55:36,106
Does Do Ra know
that CEO Gong is a womanizer?

1014
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:40,687
Should I tell her or not?

1015
00:55:41,287 --> 00:55:43,117
Gosh, this is so tricky.

1016
00:55:43,886 --> 00:55:47,486
("Straightforward Romance")

1017
00:55:55,066 --> 00:55:56,066
Well...

1018
00:55:56,597 --> 00:55:57,667
Ms. Park.

1019
00:56:00,066 --> 00:56:02,937
I told you to stay out of my sight.

1020
00:56:10,176 --> 00:56:12,477
Then I'll talk to you
out of your sight.

1021
00:56:14,247 --> 00:56:15,647
What do you think you're doing?

1022
00:56:17,417 --> 00:56:18,986
About CEO Gong Jin Dan.

1023
00:56:20,256 --> 00:56:21,886
You should know him better
before you date him.

1024
00:56:22,986 --> 00:56:25,256
Don't go out with him
just because he's being nice.

1025
00:56:26,156 --> 00:56:27,667
I'm saying this...

1026
00:56:28,327 --> 00:56:30,767
as a friend,
not as an assistant director.

1027
00:56:31,767 --> 00:56:33,566
I'm worried about you.

1028
00:56:39,736 --> 00:56:41,676
- Gosh.
- Don't you dare mess with me.

1029
00:56:42,347 --> 00:56:43,647
"As a friend?"

1030
00:56:44,247 --> 00:56:46,647
What kind of friend
would talk behind my back like that?

1031
00:56:46,647 --> 00:56:48,816
You just change sides
for your own interest.

1032
00:56:51,656 --> 00:56:54,187
Well... The thing is...

1033
00:56:54,356 --> 00:56:56,787
I've been in this field
for over 15 years,

1034
00:56:56,787 --> 00:56:59,026
and I've met people like you
numerous times.

1035
00:57:00,296 --> 00:57:01,597
You pretend to be nice...

1036
00:57:01,597 --> 00:57:04,066
as if you'd do anything for me.

1037
00:57:04,066 --> 00:57:05,767
But you stab me in the back one day.

1038
00:57:06,767 --> 00:57:07,836
"I love you, Do Ra."

1039
00:57:07,836 --> 00:57:09,807
"I will always be on your side."
They would say that.

1040
00:57:10,336 --> 00:57:12,537
But once I make a little mistake,
they tell me to kill myself...

1041
00:57:12,537 --> 00:57:14,477
and post malicious comments.

1042
00:57:14,477 --> 00:57:15,807
They criticize me and call me names.

1043
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:18,017
They even make up false rumors.

1044
00:57:19,647 --> 00:57:21,986
So I stopped making friends
at some point.

1045
00:57:23,117 --> 00:57:26,417
I don't become attached to others
and I don't trust anyone.

1046
00:57:27,886 --> 00:57:29,986
That's how I've lasted for 15 years.

1047
00:57:32,296 --> 00:57:33,966
No matter how lonely I am
and how tough it is...

1048
00:57:35,597 --> 00:57:37,196
No matter how much I miss
being with others,

1049
00:57:39,097 --> 00:57:40,966
I always kept my distance from them.

1050
00:57:45,906 --> 00:57:46,946
Ms. Park.

1051
00:57:46,946 --> 00:57:48,877
But I trusted this one person
after 15 years.

1052
00:57:51,716 --> 00:57:54,147
"I finally met someone decent."

1053
00:57:55,046 --> 00:57:56,886
"I think I can trust him."

1054
00:57:56,886 --> 00:57:59,687
"I've finally got a good friend,"
I thought.

1055
00:58:02,356 --> 00:58:04,627
I trusted the person
named Ko Pil Seung.

1056
00:58:09,526 --> 00:58:11,437
But you're no different
from the others.

1057
00:58:13,066 --> 00:58:14,466
You pretended to be my friend,

1058
00:58:14,466 --> 00:58:16,066
but you stabbed me in the back.

1059
00:58:18,836 --> 00:58:22,506
Seriously, I never imagined
you'd be doing this to me.

1060
00:58:30,117 --> 00:58:32,187
I don't want you to show your face
to me ever again.

1061
00:58:33,586 --> 00:58:34,827
You give me the creeps.

1062
00:58:52,037 --> 00:58:53,236
I'm really sorry.

1063
00:58:53,977 --> 00:58:55,207
It's all my fault.

1064
00:58:55,906 --> 00:58:57,716
What should I do
to make you feel better?

1065
00:58:57,716 --> 00:58:59,377
I'll do anything.
Tell me what to do.

1066
00:58:59,377 --> 00:59:00,816
Director Hong.

1067
00:59:01,787 --> 00:59:03,247
Didn't I make myself clear?

1068
00:59:03,756 --> 00:59:06,216
I can't do the shoot
when Assistant Director Ko is around.

1069
00:59:07,586 --> 00:59:08,926
When I see his face,

1070
00:59:08,926 --> 00:59:10,796
I get upset that
I forget all my lines!

1071
00:59:11,156 --> 00:59:14,767
Get rid of this crappy bat
this instant!

1072
00:59:14,867 --> 00:59:15,897
Hey!

1073
00:59:18,696 --> 00:59:21,636
What gives you the right
to tell them to get rid of him?

1074
00:59:22,867 --> 00:59:25,537
I'm not doing this drama
without Ko Pil Seung.

1075
00:59:25,537 --> 00:59:26,676
I won't!

1076
00:59:27,176 --> 00:59:29,577
Director Hong, I'm telling you.

1077
00:59:29,946 --> 00:59:32,676
I'll go home
if Ko Pil Seung is fired.

1078
00:59:32,676 --> 00:59:33,986
Then go home.

1079
00:59:35,417 --> 00:59:36,917
That's enough!

1080
00:59:36,917 --> 00:59:40,017
I can't take this anymore.
I'm not doing this drama.

1081
00:59:40,017 --> 00:59:42,227
Hey, wrap things up.

1082
00:59:50,867 --> 00:59:52,037
I'm sorry, Jin Gu.

1083
00:59:52,796 --> 00:59:53,836
It's my fault.

1084
00:59:55,537 --> 00:59:58,106
Are we really
wrapping things up here?

1085
00:59:58,106 --> 00:59:59,477
Have you lost your mind?

1086
00:59:59,477 --> 01:00:01,477
Do you not know how much money
we will be throwing away?

1087
01:00:02,906 --> 01:00:03,977
Pil Seung.

1088
01:00:04,477 --> 01:00:07,617
You should go home
and take some time off for the time being.

1089
01:00:08,017 --> 01:00:09,517
I'll talk to the station director...

1090
01:00:09,517 --> 01:00:12,117
and find you another project
to work on.

1091
01:00:12,787 --> 01:00:15,827
Are you telling me
to quit "Straightforward Romance?"

1092
01:00:15,886 --> 01:00:17,656
What else can we do?

1093
01:00:17,656 --> 01:00:20,526
They keep making a scene saying
they won't do this with you around.

1094
01:00:23,227 --> 01:00:26,466
I know you've worked really hard.

1095
01:00:26,466 --> 01:00:29,437
Why don't you take some time off
and go on a vacation?

1096
01:00:29,437 --> 01:00:30,606
Isn't that nice?

1097
01:00:31,276 --> 01:00:34,406
Pil Seung, please help me out here.

1098
01:00:37,847 --> 01:00:38,847
Jin Gu.

1099
01:00:39,977 --> 01:00:41,446
How can you be doing this to me?

1100
01:00:42,187 --> 01:00:44,156
What do you think
made me end up like this?

1101
01:00:47,287 --> 01:00:48,486
Fine. I get it.

1102
01:00:49,727 --> 01:00:50,897
I'll quit.

1103
01:00:51,597 --> 01:00:54,026
And from this day forward,

1104
01:00:55,696 --> 01:00:57,667
we'll never see each other again.

1105
01:00:59,196 --> 01:01:01,406
Hey, what do you mean...

1106
01:01:01,406 --> 01:01:03,106
we will never see each other again?

1107
01:01:03,106 --> 01:01:06,276
Hey. Just take some time off.
I'll be in touch.

1108
01:01:06,606 --> 01:01:08,946
Pil Seung, I'm sorry.

1109
01:01:13,986 --> 01:01:16,946
All right. I did everything I could.

1110
01:01:17,787 --> 01:01:19,417
I can't take this anymore.

1111
01:01:19,417 --> 01:01:21,127
I don't want to!

1112
01:01:25,997 --> 01:01:26,997
No.

1113
01:01:28,367 --> 01:01:29,426
Why do I have to quit?

1114
01:01:30,667 --> 01:01:32,236
I mean,
after everything I've gone through?

1115
01:01:34,236 --> 01:01:36,066
I can't let this
put a dent in my career.

1116
01:01:38,176 --> 01:01:39,176
That's right.

1117
01:01:40,307 --> 01:01:41,647
This is the only way...

1118
01:01:42,807 --> 01:01:43,946
to get me out of this.

1119
01:01:58,656 --> 01:01:59,727
Park Do Ra.

1120
01:02:02,267 --> 01:02:03,497
We need to talk.

1121
01:02:05,367 --> 01:02:07,566
This is unbelievable.

1122
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:11,236
Did you just call me by my name?

1123
01:02:12,236 --> 01:02:13,807
And you're talking down to me.

1124
01:02:17,006 --> 01:02:18,546
Have you lost your mind?

1125
01:02:19,716 --> 01:02:21,617
Do Ra, just help me this once.

1126
01:02:23,316 --> 01:02:24,716
Think about the time
we spent together.

1127
01:02:25,617 --> 01:02:27,187
Can't you cut me
some slack this once?

1128
01:02:28,526 --> 01:02:31,256
Mr. Ko Pil Seung. Did you just say
the time we spent together?

1129
01:02:31,627 --> 01:02:33,356
What time are you talking about?

1130
01:02:33,966 --> 01:02:36,097
And how dare you call me Do Ra?

1131
01:02:36,526 --> 01:02:38,696
- Director Hong...
- Do Ra, it's me. I'm Dae Chung.

1132
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:42,037
Dae Chung.

1133
01:02:43,707 --> 01:02:44,776
Ko Dae Chung.

1134
01:02:45,906 --> 01:02:48,147
What did you say?

1135
01:02:50,446 --> 01:02:51,477
Who?

1136
01:02:58,656 --> 01:03:01,426
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1137
01:03:33,557 --> 01:03:36,486
He sent a reporter
to Chairman Gong's wedding.

1138
01:03:36,486 --> 01:03:38,756
The bride by Chairman Gong's side...

1139
01:03:38,756 --> 01:03:39,756
How dare he?

1140
01:03:39,756 --> 01:03:42,196
I will do this before I die
even if it's the last thing I do.

1141
01:03:42,196 --> 01:03:44,696
You have nothing but love
for the son you didn't give birth to,

1142
01:03:44,696 --> 01:03:47,606
but you couldn't care less
about your own husband.

1143
01:03:47,606 --> 01:03:48,636
If Ms. Park allows it,

1144
01:03:48,636 --> 01:03:50,906
I'd gladly be your son-in-law
starting tomorrow.

1145
01:03:50,906 --> 01:03:54,446
I invested a huge amount
without letting Do Ra know and...

1146
01:03:54,446 --> 01:03:56,647
How much do you need?
Please don't hesitate to tell me.

1147
01:03:56,707 --> 01:03:59,176
A wind wave warning has been issued,
and we must pack up for the day.

1148
01:03:59,176 --> 01:04:00,816
To the dock, everyone!

1149
01:04:00,816 --> 01:04:02,417
I didn't get on the boat.

1150
01:04:02,486 --> 01:04:04,256
I'm still on that island.

1151
01:04:04,256 --> 01:04:05,756
Someone's still here!

1152
01:04:05,756 --> 01:04:08,086
- What the... Who...
- Stop!

1153
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:13,097
