1
00:00:00,104 --> 00:00:07,434
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:08,373 --> 00:00:10,402
- What...
- Gosh, hello.

3
00:00:10,402 --> 00:00:12,452
The door was open. Goodness me.

4
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:15,783
I came by to apologize.

5
00:00:15,783 --> 00:00:18,813
The last time I was here,
I was too upset...

6
00:00:18,813 --> 00:00:21,522
that I wronged you
in the worst way possible.

7
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:23,453
I'm terribly sorry.

8
00:00:23,453 --> 00:00:26,073
By the way,
is Director Ko home from work?

9
00:00:27,893 --> 00:00:29,703
- Mom?
- What?

10
00:00:31,763 --> 00:00:34,512
Do Sik, why are you here?

11
00:00:35,263 --> 00:00:36,442
What?

12
00:00:36,862 --> 00:00:39,282
Mom? Who's your mom?

13
00:00:40,873 --> 00:00:43,123
Is she your mom?

14
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:47,153
Are you telling me
that you're her son?

15
00:00:51,483 --> 00:00:53,763
You see... Yes...

16
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:55,382
She's my mother.

17
00:00:55,382 --> 00:00:56,382
My gosh.

18
00:00:56,382 --> 00:00:59,153
Hold on a second.
The older brother to the late Do Ra.

19
00:00:59,153 --> 00:01:01,773
Were you the son
that was in middle school?

20
00:01:02,363 --> 00:01:03,793
My gosh.

21
00:01:03,793 --> 00:01:05,962
- Mom!
- Mother!

22
00:01:05,962 --> 00:01:08,242
Do Sik, is this true?

23
00:01:08,562 --> 00:01:10,013
Did you...

24
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,702
go out with me knowing who I was?

25
00:01:12,702 --> 00:01:14,502
No, I figured it out
when I came here today.

26
00:01:14,502 --> 00:01:15,882
I had no idea.

27
00:01:16,202 --> 00:01:19,472
You crazy dolt.
Are you dating this old hag?

28
00:01:19,472 --> 00:01:22,082
Is that why
you were here with her family?

29
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:25,252
Who on earth
are you calling an old hag?

30
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,082
Mom, don't refer
to Myung Dong like that.

31
00:01:27,082 --> 00:01:28,123
Hold on.

32
00:01:28,123 --> 00:01:30,552
How dare you date someone
from this rotten family?

33
00:01:30,552 --> 00:01:32,323
My gosh. You're leaving with me.

34
00:01:32,323 --> 00:01:34,192
- You imbecile. Come on.
- But...

35
00:01:34,192 --> 00:01:35,722
- Mom, wait.
- I'm home.

36
00:01:35,722 --> 00:01:37,222
- Myung Dong, I...
- Come on!

37
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,062
- I had no idea. Believe me.
- Come with me.

38
00:01:39,062 --> 00:01:40,793
- Myung Dong...
- Do Sik!

39
00:01:40,793 --> 00:01:42,002
- Myung Dong!
- Come on!

40
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:43,603
- Hyun Chul, get Myung Dong.
- Right.

41
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:46,353
- Where are you going?
- Myung Dong!

42
00:01:46,802 --> 00:01:47,972
- My gosh.
- Hey.

43
00:01:47,972 --> 00:01:49,502
- What on earth?
- What...

44
00:01:49,502 --> 00:01:51,472
- What's going on?
- I can't believe it.

45
00:01:51,472 --> 00:01:54,153
How could you date that old hag?

46
00:01:54,413 --> 00:01:56,413
- Do Sik.
- Hey.

47
00:01:56,413 --> 00:01:58,252
How dare you call my son's name?

48
00:01:58,252 --> 00:01:59,713
Don't even think about dating him.

49
00:01:59,713 --> 00:02:00,713
Myung Dong.

50
00:02:00,713 --> 00:02:02,222
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

51
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:04,952
You are to stay away from her.

52
00:02:04,952 --> 00:02:06,092
- Got it?
- But...

53
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,163
- What?
- Why are you being mean to Do Sik?

54
00:02:08,163 --> 00:02:09,892
Get back inside!

55
00:02:09,892 --> 00:02:12,493
Please don't tell her off.
Myung Dong did nothing wrong.

56
00:02:12,493 --> 00:02:15,032
How dare you call her
like she's your junior?

57
00:02:15,032 --> 00:02:16,063
You're unbelievable.

58
00:02:16,063 --> 00:02:17,763
As if being old is anything
to brag about.

59
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:19,772
- What a disgrace.
- I'll call you.

60
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:21,033
- Come on.
- You have to call me.

61
00:02:21,033 --> 00:02:22,452
- Gosh.
- Let's go.

62
00:02:22,702 --> 00:02:23,852
Goodness.

63
00:02:26,872 --> 00:02:29,242
What are you staring at?
You've never seen a person before?

64
00:02:29,242 --> 00:02:31,632
Stay out of it.
How dare a country bumpkin butt in?

65
00:02:31,753 --> 00:02:32,853
Let's go!

66
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:34,963
- Hey, you!
- Come along.

67
00:02:35,223 --> 00:02:36,803
Hey! Get out of here!

68
00:02:36,952 --> 00:02:38,452
Get lost, you rotten skunks!

69
00:02:38,452 --> 00:02:41,542
How dare you
try to snag my daughter?

70
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:47,243
Gosh.

71
00:02:48,003 --> 00:02:49,542
What happened?

72
00:02:49,832 --> 00:02:52,653
They escorted him in
with such a welcoming manner.

73
00:02:54,103 --> 00:02:56,118
Wait. Let's see.

74
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:59,593
The guy Myung Dong is dating
is the crazy woman's son?

75
00:03:00,672 --> 00:03:02,692
Gosh. That's no joke.

76
00:03:04,212 --> 00:03:07,393
How did Myung Dong
end up with the son of a witch?

77
00:03:07,883 --> 00:03:10,502
Oh, gosh. I'm against it too.

78
00:03:12,952 --> 00:03:17,143
But did I see that guy
from somewhere?

79
00:03:18,293 --> 00:03:19,942
He looked familiar.

80
00:03:20,563 --> 00:03:23,412
You fool, Park Do Sik!

81
00:03:23,462 --> 00:03:26,133
Get a grip.
Are you out of your mind?

82
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:27,872
We might be penniless,

83
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:30,973
but how can you date
a pathetic older girl like her?

84
00:03:30,973 --> 00:03:33,848
When you were in middle school
she was in university!

85
00:03:33,872 --> 00:03:36,463
We don't go around with our ages
stamped on our foreheads.

86
00:03:36,513 --> 00:03:38,383
You'd never know
Myung Dong was that old.

87
00:03:38,383 --> 00:03:40,853
So don't call her
a pathetic older girl.

88
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:43,063
What did you just say? My gosh.

89
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:46,173
Look at you! Good grief.

90
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:48,442
At first, I treated her politely...

91
00:03:48,622 --> 00:03:50,702
as her older age dictated I should.

92
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:52,713
But after a while,
she felt like a younger sister.

93
00:03:52,763 --> 00:03:55,942
I couldn't help it
that I wanted to protect her.

94
00:03:56,063 --> 00:03:58,802
You saw her yourself.
She has a pretty face.

95
00:03:58,802 --> 00:04:00,633
She looks young for her age too.

96
00:04:00,633 --> 00:04:03,083
What?
She felt like a younger sister?

97
00:04:03,302 --> 00:04:05,993
Gosh. You really do have
a loose screw.

98
00:04:06,242 --> 00:04:08,783
Okay, fine.
You didn't know who she was.

99
00:04:08,783 --> 00:04:11,662
But now you do,
so break up with her.

100
00:04:11,712 --> 00:04:12,792
End it.

101
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,283
Her family and ours
are sworn enemies.

102
00:04:14,283 --> 00:04:16,232
She's a member of our enemy.

103
00:04:16,552 --> 00:04:17,922
How can I leave someone I love?

104
00:04:17,922 --> 00:04:19,169
How can I end it?

105
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:21,843
We got back together
after a long detour.

106
00:04:22,122 --> 00:04:24,842
What? Are you my son?

107
00:04:25,062 --> 00:04:27,543
Do you know
how those women treated me?

108
00:04:27,932 --> 00:04:30,663
If that's what you'll say,
go somewhere and off yourself.

109
00:04:30,663 --> 00:04:33,882
- Go and die somewhere. Get lost.
- Hey. Don't.

110
00:04:34,502 --> 00:04:36,572
Sit up, Myung Dong.

111
00:04:36,572 --> 00:04:38,392
Sit up right now.

112
00:04:39,643 --> 00:04:40,752
You...

113
00:04:41,742 --> 00:04:45,092
The fool you said you slept with.
Was that the guy?

114
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:46,632
Was it?

115
00:04:47,012 --> 00:04:48,433
Don't ask.

116
00:04:48,653 --> 00:04:50,563
Why even ask that in this situation?

117
00:04:51,723 --> 00:04:53,533
It was him.

118
00:04:53,622 --> 00:04:55,902
What should we do now?

119
00:04:55,992 --> 00:04:57,342
What should we do?

120
00:04:58,663 --> 00:05:02,613
Hey. How could you go around
dating someone like him?

121
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,442
What's wrong with you?

122
00:05:05,002 --> 00:05:08,183
Were you wearing rotten fish eyes
when you picked him out?

123
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,092
You liked that I chose him.

124
00:05:12,172 --> 00:05:13,652
You said you liked him.

125
00:05:14,713 --> 00:05:16,462
Things have changed since then!

126
00:05:17,043 --> 00:05:19,063
Don't you know how things are?

127
00:05:19,583 --> 00:05:21,459
His family.

128
00:05:21,483 --> 00:05:23,803
They lost everything
after Park Do Ra died.

129
00:05:23,922 --> 00:05:25,733
They're penniless!

130
00:05:27,492 --> 00:05:28,772
Mom.

131
00:05:29,492 --> 00:05:31,023
Did you like him then...

132
00:05:31,023 --> 00:05:33,543
because he gave me a diamond ring
and you thought he was rich?

133
00:05:34,663 --> 00:05:37,142
But now we should break up
because he's poor?

134
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:40,603
How can you say that
about the same guy?

135
00:05:40,603 --> 00:05:41,683
What?

136
00:05:42,002 --> 00:05:43,322
I can't do that.

137
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,293
I can't break up with Do Sik.

138
00:05:45,672 --> 00:05:46,793
You...

139
00:05:47,713 --> 00:05:48,822
Myung Dong.

140
00:05:49,283 --> 00:05:52,012
He's the son of the woman...

141
00:05:52,012 --> 00:05:54,192
who killed
your sister-in-law's father.

142
00:05:54,283 --> 00:05:57,002
Do you think Hyun Chul
and Sun Young will let this happen?

143
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:58,873
It's a no.

144
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:03,439
That wasn't Do Sik's fault.

145
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:04,913
What did you say?

146
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,313
Hey, Myung Dong.

147
00:06:09,862 --> 00:06:11,872
Forget about everything else.

148
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,072
If you marry...

149
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:15,983
a penniless man like that
at your age,

150
00:06:16,203 --> 00:06:18,273
your life will be full of torment
until the end.

151
00:06:18,273 --> 00:06:21,962
You'll walk right into
a life of turmoil.

152
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:25,063
Mom. I'm okay with that.

153
00:06:25,213 --> 00:06:28,012
I told Do Sik I'd support him.

154
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:31,533
I asked him out
by offering to support him.

155
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:34,453
You did what? Are you stupid?

156
00:06:34,453 --> 00:06:36,743
Why should you support him?

157
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,873
He's not your son!

158
00:06:39,093 --> 00:06:43,262
I'd rather you offer
to support me, you idiot.

159
00:06:43,262 --> 00:06:45,548
Will you stop it?

160
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,072
Be quiet!

161
00:06:48,072 --> 00:06:50,442
- You darn brat.
- Stop it!

162
00:06:50,442 --> 00:06:52,812
I'd rather you just die.

163
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:55,242
Die single, you wench.

164
00:06:55,242 --> 00:06:57,692
You stupid brat!

165
00:06:58,413 --> 00:06:59,632
Goodness.

166
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:02,752
What should we do now?

167
00:07:02,752 --> 00:07:04,382
I bought
a 200-dollar fruit basket...

168
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,393
at a department store,

169
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:07,973
and you ruined it.

170
00:07:08,692 --> 00:07:11,223
I need to impress Ko Pil Seung...

171
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,973
and get Do Do a role.

172
00:07:14,163 --> 00:07:17,603
The investment we got
went into the old car and expenses.

173
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,152
- What will you do now?
- Darn it.

174
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:21,853
Oh, gosh.

175
00:07:23,372 --> 00:07:24,452
Right.

176
00:07:25,012 --> 00:07:27,343
Mom. As we left Myung Dong's place,

177
00:07:27,343 --> 00:07:29,293
you called someone
a country bumpkin.

178
00:07:29,612 --> 00:07:33,063
When I saw her,
I almost called her "Do Ra."

179
00:07:34,552 --> 00:07:35,959
What are you on about?

180
00:07:35,983 --> 00:07:37,462
I don't know.

181
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,233
I saw her and thought she was Do Ra.

182
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:41,593
You fool.

183
00:07:41,593 --> 00:07:44,463
How dare you compare her
to our Do Ra?

184
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:45,932
With eyes like that,

185
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,043
it's no wonder
you fell for an old girl.

186
00:07:48,463 --> 00:07:50,212
Myung Dong isn't old.

187
00:07:50,862 --> 00:07:52,082
She has a baby face.

188
00:07:52,703 --> 00:07:54,212
She what?

189
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:58,752
For your mom's sake,
you'd better break it off.

190
00:07:59,172 --> 00:08:03,192
Impressing Ko Pil Seung
is our priority, you punk.

191
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:04,663
Oh, gosh.

192
00:08:06,182 --> 00:08:08,552
Oh, no. Myung Dong has gone!

193
00:08:08,552 --> 00:08:11,552
Myung Dong is missing. She has gone.

194
00:08:11,552 --> 00:08:12,992
- Mom.
- What?

195
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,122
I told you to watch her.

196
00:08:15,122 --> 00:08:16,772
Did she sneak out to see the guy?

197
00:08:16,992 --> 00:08:19,538
It wouldn't be that.

198
00:08:19,562 --> 00:08:22,062
She won't go to see him,

199
00:08:22,062 --> 00:08:23,983
not when she knows who he is.

200
00:08:24,163 --> 00:08:27,082
She must've gone out
to get some air.

201
00:08:27,203 --> 00:08:29,242
I bet she went to see him.

202
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,749
Where else could she go this early?

203
00:08:30,773 --> 00:08:32,643
She won't pick up.

204
00:08:32,643 --> 00:08:34,053
There's no point in trying.

205
00:08:35,012 --> 00:08:37,692
Are you home?

206
00:08:38,382 --> 00:08:39,493
Hey.

207
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,998
Isn't it that witch's voice?

208
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,303
What? What the heck?

209
00:08:45,652 --> 00:08:46,773
Goodness.

210
00:08:47,723 --> 00:08:50,122
Why are you here so early?

211
00:08:50,122 --> 00:08:51,762
What business do you have here?

212
00:08:51,762 --> 00:08:54,262
Oh, my goodness.

213
00:08:54,262 --> 00:08:57,508
I wronged you in so many ways.

214
00:08:57,532 --> 00:09:00,582
I came to apologize.

215
00:09:01,372 --> 00:09:03,582
Why are you on your knees?

216
00:09:05,272 --> 00:09:07,573
I share a one-room apartment
with my son.

217
00:09:07,573 --> 00:09:10,222
I've done all sorts of things
since Do Ra died.

218
00:09:10,642 --> 00:09:12,382
I washed dishes at a diner...

219
00:09:12,382 --> 00:09:14,213
and sold gimbap at a subway station.

220
00:09:14,213 --> 00:09:16,303
I did anything to go on living.

221
00:09:17,752 --> 00:09:20,773
But this was the one trade
I knew how to do well.

222
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:22,622
It was all I could do.

223
00:09:22,622 --> 00:09:24,543
So I got back to it
after many struggles.

224
00:09:24,862 --> 00:09:26,132
The station director...

225
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,982
I used to work with
offered to help me out.

226
00:09:29,063 --> 00:09:31,872
All I needed was an okay
from Ko Pil Seung,

227
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:34,573
and the actress I represented
could've gotten a role.

228
00:09:34,573 --> 00:09:38,002
I mistakenly thought
Director Ko said no...

229
00:09:38,002 --> 00:09:39,573
because he had a grudge against me.

230
00:09:39,573 --> 00:09:42,063
I got so upset
and distraught that...

231
00:09:42,713 --> 00:09:46,683
I did some things to you
that no one should do to anyone.

232
00:09:46,683 --> 00:09:50,462
I'm so very sorry.
I want to apologize.

233
00:09:52,323 --> 00:09:56,143
So, Director Ko isn't...

234
00:09:57,323 --> 00:10:00,043
He left for work very early.

235
00:10:01,262 --> 00:10:04,482
Will you please
apologize to him for me...

236
00:10:04,803 --> 00:10:07,402
and tell him to take pity on me?

237
00:10:07,402 --> 00:10:10,542
And ask him to look at me
with favor and put in...

238
00:10:10,542 --> 00:10:12,153
a good word for me. Please?

239
00:10:12,973 --> 00:10:14,872
Well, okay.

240
00:10:14,872 --> 00:10:17,393
Why would you say "okay" to that?

241
00:10:17,443 --> 00:10:19,462
Have you forgotten
what she did to us?

242
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,732
Tell her to quit the nonsense
and get out.

243
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:27,353
Tell your son
to leave my daughter alone!

244
00:10:27,353 --> 00:10:29,662
They can't stay together. Okay?

245
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:31,833
You needn't worry about that at all.

246
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,773
And about your in-law...

247
00:10:33,892 --> 00:10:35,803
I'm sorry
about what happened to him.

248
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:38,313
I apologize
from the bottom of my heart.

249
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,313
How dare you?

250
00:10:45,872 --> 00:10:48,423
She should get into acting herself.

251
00:10:48,713 --> 00:10:51,293
She's putting on a great show.

252
00:10:56,752 --> 00:10:58,702
What should we do now?

253
00:11:02,193 --> 00:11:03,942
I thought about it all night.

254
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:08,072
I can't live without you.
What about you?

255
00:11:10,032 --> 00:11:11,112
Me neither.

256
00:11:11,733 --> 00:11:13,553
I don't want to imagine life...

257
00:11:14,502 --> 00:11:15,852
without you, Do Sik.

258
00:11:18,173 --> 00:11:21,192
Let's hold hands tight
and get through...

259
00:11:21,242 --> 00:11:22,992
all the hardships.

260
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,393
Love blooms through trials.

261
00:11:34,892 --> 00:11:38,972
Your family must've been shocked
to realize who I was.

262
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,612
They can't accept me right away...

263
00:11:42,103 --> 00:11:44,413
after what my mom did.

264
00:11:48,073 --> 00:11:51,352
I'll go on my knees
and apologize for what she did,

265
00:11:51,843 --> 00:11:53,092
and then gain their approval.

266
00:11:55,183 --> 00:11:58,222
Do Sik. Will you really do that?

267
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:02,263
Will you be there by my side?

268
00:12:04,782 --> 00:12:06,003
Of course.

269
00:12:07,223 --> 00:12:08,693
- Darn you!
- Mom.

270
00:12:08,693 --> 00:12:11,892
How dare you come
crawling back here?

271
00:12:11,892 --> 00:12:14,392
Mother.
Put this down and talk instead.

272
00:12:14,392 --> 00:12:16,162
You think talking will resolve this?

273
00:12:16,162 --> 00:12:18,733
Leave this instant.
Don't sit there another second.

274
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:20,573
- You crazy fool.
- Myung Dong.

275
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,843
Why did you bring him back here?

276
00:12:21,843 --> 00:12:23,303
Did you not see this coming?

277
00:12:23,303 --> 00:12:26,542
Mom, can't you give Do Sik
some slack this once?

278
00:12:26,542 --> 00:12:28,372
He didn't do anything wrong.

279
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,592
Let go of me.
And you stay out of my way.

280
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:33,462
Mother, I apologize
for what my mother did.

281
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:36,282
And my feelings for Myung Dong
are sincere.

282
00:12:36,282 --> 00:12:39,453
"Mother?" How dare you?

283
00:12:39,453 --> 00:12:41,923
You punk. There's no way
I'd be your mother-in-law.

284
00:12:41,923 --> 00:12:44,823
I will never have
a son-in-law like you.

285
00:12:44,823 --> 00:12:46,292
- Get out!
- Mother.

286
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:48,603
I don't think today is a good day.
We should leave now.

287
00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:49,933
Get up.

288
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:52,803
I'm really sorry, Mother.
I will come again soon.

289
00:12:52,803 --> 00:12:54,132
I'm so sorry.

290
00:12:54,132 --> 00:12:55,742
Hey! Myung Dong!

291
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:56,803
Bring Myung Dong back.

292
00:12:56,803 --> 00:12:59,242
Hey! You silly brat!

293
00:12:59,242 --> 00:13:02,523
You can't beat him like that, Mother.

294
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:04,523
- Oh, dear.
- Gosh.

295
00:13:05,483 --> 00:13:06,633
My goodness.

296
00:13:10,983 --> 00:13:13,372
Mother, the thing is,

297
00:13:13,723 --> 00:13:15,503
I'm in love with your son.

298
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:17,143
What?

299
00:13:17,392 --> 00:13:19,738
How dare you
have feelings for my son?

300
00:13:19,762 --> 00:13:20,892
You shameless brat.

301
00:13:20,892 --> 00:13:22,762
- How dare you?
- My goodness.

302
00:13:22,762 --> 00:13:24,482
I'm going to kill you!

303
00:13:29,173 --> 00:13:31,173
My goodness.

304
00:13:31,173 --> 00:13:32,352
Fine.

305
00:13:32,772 --> 00:13:34,813
I don't want to end up...

306
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:37,012
getting beaten up with a broomstick
because of that mean director...

307
00:13:37,012 --> 00:13:39,063
who keeps trying to stop me
from doing what I want to do.

308
00:13:40,282 --> 00:13:41,633
I shouldn't be with him.

309
00:13:42,152 --> 00:13:45,332
It's a good thing
I decided to give up on him.

310
00:13:58,433 --> 00:14:01,283
Ji Young,
why did you get here so late?

311
00:14:02,372 --> 00:14:04,183
Jae Dong, what brings you here?

312
00:14:04,902 --> 00:14:06,692
Why? Is something wrong?

313
00:14:07,843 --> 00:14:10,692
Here's a script.
Get practicing right away.

314
00:14:10,912 --> 00:14:12,563
You have an audition tomorrow.

315
00:14:15,782 --> 00:14:18,232
What are you talking about,
Jae Dong?

316
00:14:18,622 --> 00:14:21,053
How would I go for an audition?

317
00:14:21,053 --> 00:14:23,923
I'm not capable
of auditioning for a part.

318
00:14:23,923 --> 00:14:26,492
I'm sure I'll get cold feet.

319
00:14:26,492 --> 00:14:30,643
Ji Young, I'm not telling you
to pass the audition.

320
00:14:30,933 --> 00:14:33,303
It's only for the experience.

321
00:14:33,303 --> 00:14:34,913
You should learn from experience.

322
00:14:35,173 --> 00:14:36,902
I guess you have a point, but...

323
00:14:36,902 --> 00:14:38,742
And if you pass the audition,

324
00:14:38,742 --> 00:14:40,692
it will change your life.

325
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,293
This audition is...

326
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,962
for a second lead role.

327
00:14:47,112 --> 00:14:48,563
- A second lead?
- Yes.

328
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:53,673
Gosh, that's too big a part for me.

329
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:56,303
Seriously, I don't know
anything about acting.

330
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:59,262
I can't do this. I'm scared.

331
00:14:59,262 --> 00:15:02,143
This is how a star is born.

332
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,502
It's not like all the stars did well
from the beginning.

333
00:15:04,502 --> 00:15:06,383
This is how
you build up your career.

334
00:15:07,233 --> 00:15:09,383
- Are you serious?
- Of course.

335
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,822
Ji Young, trust me.

336
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,722
There is no turning back.

337
00:15:14,772 --> 00:15:17,362
We will just go for it
and work towards our goal.

338
00:15:20,983 --> 00:15:22,403
You got this. Here.

339
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:24,503
You can do this.

340
00:15:33,292 --> 00:15:34,472
Director Ko.

341
00:15:35,662 --> 00:15:37,212
Did you want to see me?

342
00:15:38,603 --> 00:15:39,733
- Jae Dong.
- Yes?

343
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:41,733
Your new agency,
Popcorn Entertainment.

344
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,372
I love the name.

345
00:15:43,372 --> 00:15:46,573
I hope it will pop up on the scene
and hit the jackpot.

346
00:15:46,573 --> 00:15:48,753
I will give it my best shot.
Thank you.

347
00:15:50,612 --> 00:15:51,793
By the way, Jae Dong,

348
00:15:53,112 --> 00:15:56,163
why does Ji Young have to be
the first actress at your agency?

349
00:15:57,382 --> 00:16:00,403
I think you're barking up
the wrong tree.

350
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:03,522
You know Ji Young is
simple-minded and clumsy.

351
00:16:03,522 --> 00:16:06,162
She's totally out of touch
with the real world.

352
00:16:06,162 --> 00:16:08,063
How would a person like her
become an actor?

353
00:16:08,063 --> 00:16:10,963
It's not that
anyone can become an actor.

354
00:16:10,963 --> 00:16:12,183
You need to have quick wits
to make a good actor.

355
00:16:14,132 --> 00:16:16,482
I'm just saying this
because I care about you.

356
00:16:16,573 --> 00:16:19,122
I'll find someone better for you.

357
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:22,692
You should terminate
the contract with Ji Young, okay?

358
00:16:23,512 --> 00:16:26,533
Director Ko. I mean, Pil Seung.

359
00:16:27,512 --> 00:16:29,533
Don't you think
you're being ridiculous?

360
00:16:30,252 --> 00:16:31,782
You know Ji Young is good at acting.

361
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,022
But why do you keep
speaking ill of her?

362
00:16:33,022 --> 00:16:34,933
I just don't understand
why you're being like this.

363
00:16:35,923 --> 00:16:38,273
I believe
Ji Young will make a good actress.

365
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,063
Do you remember the day...

366
00:16:45,063 --> 00:16:47,952
when I was eating tteokbokki,
sitting on the ground?

367
00:16:48,603 --> 00:16:51,553
And you got me some steak,
so I was very grateful.

368
00:16:52,002 --> 00:16:55,542
I'm saying all this because
I want things to go well for you.

369
00:16:55,542 --> 00:16:57,583
I want you to succeed.

370
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,533
Ji Young isn't
the right choice for you.

371
00:16:59,912 --> 00:17:02,533
Okay, I get it. I'll think about it.

372
00:17:03,853 --> 00:17:06,803
Jae Dong, you mark my words.

373
00:17:10,122 --> 00:17:12,243
I have to stop Ji Young
from becoming an actress.

374
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:15,142
But why wouldn't he listen to me?

375
00:17:18,602 --> 00:17:22,182
What?
Did Director Ko speak ill of me?

376
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,143
Yes, he did.

377
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,572
He says you're
simple-minded, slow-witted,

378
00:17:26,572 --> 00:17:28,053
and out of touch
with the real world.

379
00:17:28,342 --> 00:17:30,822
He also says
your clumsiness embarrasses him.

380
00:17:31,443 --> 00:17:33,862
He doesn't even think
you have the face to be an actress.

381
00:17:33,913 --> 00:17:34,993
What?

382
00:17:36,282 --> 00:17:38,662
Did Director Ko really say that?

383
00:17:42,052 --> 00:17:43,142
Ji Young.

384
00:17:46,963 --> 00:17:48,072
We need to talk.

385
00:17:50,463 --> 00:17:51,983
What's there to talk about?

386
00:17:52,403 --> 00:17:54,602
A woman like me
who is not pretty enough,

387
00:17:54,602 --> 00:17:57,873
slow-witted, naive,
and simple-minded...

388
00:17:57,873 --> 00:18:01,193
doesn't deserve to talk with you.

389
00:18:02,213 --> 00:18:03,742
I mean, I wouldn't understand
what you said.

390
00:18:03,742 --> 00:18:04,822
Well...

391
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:08,063
What are you talking about?

392
00:18:08,413 --> 00:18:12,473
These are the exact words you said.
Why are you acting flustered?

393
00:18:13,223 --> 00:18:14,533
I heard the whole thing.

394
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:16,592
CEO Lee Jae Dong told me...

395
00:18:16,592 --> 00:18:18,943
how you said
I wouldn't make a good actress.

396
00:18:20,863 --> 00:18:21,943
But...

397
00:18:22,332 --> 00:18:24,508
I didn't go that far.

398
00:18:24,532 --> 00:18:25,612
Whatever.

399
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:31,042
Strangely, after hearing
what you said about me,

400
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:34,822
it makes me want to succeed
as an actress even more.

401
00:18:35,173 --> 00:18:36,512
Thank you, Mr. Ko.

402
00:18:36,512 --> 00:18:39,332
For keeping me so motivated.

403
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:43,402
I'll make sure
to pass the audition tomorrow.

404
00:18:45,223 --> 00:18:46,332
Wait...

405
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,602

Hello, Ji Young. It's me.

409
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,622
We have one meal left to enjoy.

410

What about today?

411
00:19:12,713 --> 00:19:15,189
I'm sorry, Mr. Gong, but not today.

412
00:19:15,213 --> 00:19:18,153
I have an audition to prepare for.

413
00:19:18,153 --> 00:19:20,228
I'm too busy today.

414
00:19:20,252 --> 00:19:21,672
Maybe some other time.

415
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:24,203
I see. Okay.

416
00:19:25,223 --> 00:19:26,342
Bye.

417
00:19:29,262 --> 00:19:30,342
What?

418
00:19:31,302 --> 00:19:33,953
Did she just refuse
to go out with me?

419
00:19:36,473 --> 00:19:39,352
Did she even know
what she was doing?

420
00:19:40,842 --> 00:19:43,322
I was just being nice to her
because she looked like Park Do Ra,

421
00:19:44,012 --> 00:19:45,892
and now she's getting all cocky.

422
00:19:48,552 --> 00:19:49,552

425
00:19:58,262 --> 00:19:59,342
Yes.

426
00:20:01,032 --> 00:20:02,172
Tonight?

427
00:20:03,133 --> 00:20:04,682
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

428
00:20:05,562 --> 00:20:09,382
I was there at Michael's birthday party
in New York back then.

429
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:11,483
- Really?
- Yes.

430
00:20:11,973 --> 00:20:13,373
That day, I told Tae Hee...

431
00:20:13,373 --> 00:20:15,922
that she would probably
end up falling for you.

432
00:20:16,113 --> 00:20:18,613
And then you two met again,

433
00:20:18,613 --> 00:20:20,463
and you're now going out
with marriage in mind.

434
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:23,303
I got goosebumps when I heard that.

435
00:20:25,322 --> 00:20:27,629
- Gyeong Hwa, are you serious?
- Yes.

436

you are meant to be together.

438
00:20:33,292 --> 00:20:34,543
You should come to our wedding.

439

I'll order some more for you.

440
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:42,842
- Let's have some wine.
- Fine.

441
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:44,352
I should focus on Tae Hee.

442
00:20:44,602 --> 00:20:46,892

about that country bumpkin.

at this late hour...

00:21:35,013 --> 00:21:36,724
just to tell me once again...

449
00:21:37,684 --> 00:21:40,464
that I shouldn't get into acting?

450

Director Ko, I only ask
out of pure curiosity.

451

If I become an actor,

452
00:21:52,523 --> 00:21:54,673
will that cause

Director Ko must like me for real.

502
00:25:14,934 --> 00:25:18,509
He was being this way
because he didn't want me...

503
00:25:18,533 --> 00:25:20,843
to get hurt like Park Do Ra
or end up like her.

504
00:25:21,773 --> 00:25:23,033
The last thing he wants...

505
00:25:23,033 --> 00:25:24,754
is to lose someone else
he cares about.

506
00:25:26,474 --> 00:25:28,494

00:25:33,843 --> 00:25:36,393

No.

509
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,304

510
00:25:47,694 --> 00:25:49,814
I will do what I want.

511
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:25,143
Really? Did they break up?

512
00:26:26,164 --> 00:26:29,084
Yes, she said so
when she called last night.

513
00:26:30,273 --> 00:26:33,683
Then why hasn't she come home?

514
00:26:34,174 --> 00:26:36,054
Could she be with him
but have lied to you about it?

515
00:26:36,414 --> 00:26:39,994
As if she'd be scared of any of us
to lie at that age.

516
00:26:40,043 --> 00:26:41,813
If that had been the case,
they would've gotten...

517
00:26:41,813 --> 00:26:43,234
their own place to live by now.

518
00:26:44,113 --> 00:26:45,234
I guess.

519
00:26:46,853 --> 00:26:48,754
She has a friend called Jang Mi,

520
00:26:48,754 --> 00:26:52,173
and she will stay with her
while she gathers her thoughts.

521
00:26:53,293 --> 00:26:56,373
She must know
they can never be together.

522
00:26:57,904 --> 00:27:01,004
Besides, disapproval
will only light the fire hotter.

523
00:27:01,004 --> 00:27:02,284
Just ignore the matter.

524
00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:06,883
Right.
So when Myung Dong comes home,

525
00:27:07,004 --> 00:27:09,089
don't say anything
about it to her...

526
00:27:09,113 --> 00:27:11,693
or yell at her regarding the issue.

527
00:27:15,484 --> 00:27:17,294
- Myung Dong...
- What?

528
00:27:17,513 --> 00:27:19,884
Are you just getting back?

529
00:27:19,884 --> 00:27:21,304
Myung Dong,

530
00:27:21,494 --> 00:27:23,673
are you sure you two broke up?

531
00:27:23,954 --> 00:27:25,304
Did you end things?

532
00:27:26,424 --> 00:27:27,504
Yes.

533
00:27:27,934 --> 00:27:30,373
How can I not end it
when everyone's against us dating?

534
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:32,814
Really?

535
00:27:33,303 --> 00:27:35,913
Did he say he'd gladly end things?

536
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:38,653
Do Sik wanted
to break it off as well.

537
00:27:39,474 --> 00:27:41,994
Why would he want to date me...

538
00:27:42,073 --> 00:27:43,623
after getting smacked by you
with a broom?

539
00:27:44,783 --> 00:27:47,960
Gosh, what a relief.

540
00:27:47,984 --> 00:27:50,834
It's like I finally got rid
of a sore tooth.

541
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:53,660
If you think about it,

542
00:27:53,684 --> 00:27:56,504
that crazy witch
would give him an earful as well.

543
00:27:56,724 --> 00:27:58,464
Of course.

544
00:27:58,464 --> 00:28:00,673
Any sane man would back off.

545
00:28:01,964 --> 00:28:03,873
Now that I won
the screenwriter contest,

546
00:28:03,934 --> 00:28:05,244
I'm only going to focus
on my writing.

547
00:28:06,664 --> 00:28:08,004
I'll do my best...

548
00:28:08,004 --> 00:28:09,814
and make a name for myself
as a screenwriter,

549
00:28:10,603 --> 00:28:12,123
so don't worry about me.

550
00:28:20,984 --> 00:28:22,933
It seems as though
they ended things.

551
00:28:24,254 --> 00:28:27,163
She finally managed to date someone,

552
00:28:28,293 --> 00:28:30,274
but it had to be him of all people.

553
00:28:31,823 --> 00:28:32,943
Goodness.

554
00:28:33,494 --> 00:28:35,613
It breaks my heart.

555
00:28:37,164 --> 00:28:38,244
Gosh.

556
00:28:53,484 --> 00:28:55,064
Do Sik, it's me.

557
00:28:55,914 --> 00:28:58,834
I just told my family
that we ended things.

558
00:28:59,283 --> 00:29:01,873
Really? I told my mom as well.

559
00:29:02,853 --> 00:29:04,274
Did she believe you?

560
00:29:04,924 --> 00:29:06,443
Of course, she did.

561
00:29:08,194 --> 00:29:10,814
Right. Then we'll meet up tomorrow.

562
00:29:10,964 --> 00:29:12,084
Sure.

563
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:15,683
Sweetie...

564
00:29:16,603 --> 00:29:17,683
I love you.

565
00:29:18,974 --> 00:29:21,423
Right. I love you too.

566
00:29:31,224 --> 00:29:32,903
("Don't Lie")

567
00:29:40,194 --> 00:29:42,373
What the... Have I lost my mind?

568
00:29:43,793 --> 00:29:44,910
Yes, I've lost my mind.

569
00:29:44,934 --> 00:29:46,833
How did this happen?

570
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:47,913
Oh, no.

571
00:29:50,033 --> 00:29:51,113
Gosh.

572
00:29:56,373 --> 00:29:57,494
What now?

573
00:29:58,214 --> 00:29:59,324
Hold on.

574
00:30:05,623 --> 00:30:06,754
Oh, dear.

575
00:30:06,754 --> 00:30:09,133
Why aren't there any available cabs?

576
00:30:12,994 --> 00:30:14,544
Ji Young, hop in.

577
00:30:16,293 --> 00:30:17,373
My gosh.

578
00:30:20,803 --> 00:30:22,383
Why would I get in your car?

579
00:30:22,974 --> 00:30:25,324
You're late for your audition,
so get in.

580
00:30:25,404 --> 00:30:28,794
You might drive me someplace else
so that I miss my audition.

581
00:30:29,373 --> 00:30:30,420
Forget it.

582
00:30:30,444 --> 00:30:31,543
Have it your way, then.

583
00:30:31,543 --> 00:30:32,724
Be late for your audition.

584
00:30:33,944 --> 00:30:36,494
If you don't get in now,
you won't get to audition.

585
00:30:41,823 --> 00:30:43,274
I'll be your cab driver today.

586
00:30:43,894 --> 00:30:45,673
Think of me as one.

587
00:30:48,194 --> 00:30:50,413
I'll put you out just for today.

588
00:30:55,004 --> 00:30:56,653
Please step on it, sir.

589
00:30:59,373 --> 00:31:00,404
If you drop me off anywhere...

590
00:31:00,404 --> 00:31:02,214
other than
where the audition is taking place,

591
00:31:02,214 --> 00:31:03,623
you'll have another thing coming.

592
00:31:03,944 --> 00:31:04,944
Got it.

593
00:31:04,944 --> 00:31:07,524
I'll make sure
to drive you to the right place.

594
00:31:13,353 --> 00:31:15,524
(Open audition for "Passion")

595
00:31:16,994 --> 00:31:18,244
Thanks for this.

596
00:31:24,704 --> 00:31:26,784
This is for the ride here.

597
00:31:27,603 --> 00:31:29,934
You called it a cab yourself.

598
00:31:29,934 --> 00:31:33,084
I paid the fare,
so you didn't do me any favors.

599
00:31:37,073 --> 00:31:38,163
Ji Young.

600
00:31:39,613 --> 00:31:42,294
Why? Did I not pay enough?

601
00:31:44,313 --> 00:31:45,734
Since you're doing this,

602
00:31:46,724 --> 00:31:48,004
I hope you get the role.

603
00:31:48,994 --> 00:31:50,074
Got it?

604
00:31:50,754 --> 00:31:51,843
What?

605
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:55,613
Right, sure.

606
00:31:58,563 --> 00:31:59,643
Ji Young.

607
00:32:00,563 --> 00:32:01,653
Break a leg.

608
00:32:02,434 --> 00:32:03,514
What?

609
00:32:05,103 --> 00:32:06,183
"Ji Young?"

610
00:32:07,914 --> 00:32:10,353
He's now calling my name
as if we were friends.

611
00:32:11,414 --> 00:32:13,460
What's up with him?

612
00:32:13,484 --> 00:32:14,564
Ji Young.

613
00:32:15,184 --> 00:32:17,093
You can do it. Go, Ji Young!

614
00:32:18,053 --> 00:32:19,334
That's so cheesy.

615
00:32:19,924 --> 00:32:21,804
What's up with him?

616
00:32:26,363 --> 00:32:27,504
That's right.

617
00:32:28,494 --> 00:32:29,943
You're Kim Ji Young.

618
00:32:31,904 --> 00:32:32,984
Kim Ji Young.

619
00:32:43,543 --> 00:32:44,663
Unbelievable.

620
00:32:46,043 --> 00:32:48,163
Even the likes of you
came to audition as well.

621
00:32:49,053 --> 00:32:51,954
Can't I go anywhere
without running into this hillbilly?

622
00:32:51,954 --> 00:32:53,564
The feeling is mutual.

623
00:32:53,924 --> 00:32:56,474
That's not how you talk
to your elders.

624
00:32:57,353 --> 00:33:00,274
You won't get any roles
speaking in a dialect like that.

625
00:33:00,664 --> 00:33:04,544
As if my speaking in a dialect
is any of your concerns.

626
00:33:05,934 --> 00:33:09,084
That darn brat.

627
00:33:09,474 --> 00:33:11,234
She has no manners.

628
00:33:11,234 --> 00:33:16,013
(Open audition for "Passion")

629
00:33:16,013 --> 00:33:18,693
I'm sorry I left
without saying anything, Kang Ho.

630
00:33:21,414 --> 00:33:24,163
Otherwise,
you wouldn't have let me leave.

631
00:33:27,523 --> 00:33:28,703
Kang Ho,

632
00:33:30,853 --> 00:33:32,724
I felt guilty being by your side...

633
00:33:32,724 --> 00:33:35,574
all while looking my best
and in good health.

634
00:33:37,563 --> 00:33:39,634
But the last thing I want
is to be with you...

635
00:33:39,634 --> 00:33:41,683
when I'm ill and sick.

636
00:33:43,174 --> 00:33:45,653
If you love me,

637
00:33:47,144 --> 00:33:48,994
understand my situation,

638
00:33:50,843 --> 00:33:52,423
and don't look for me.

639
00:33:56,484 --> 00:33:57,593
Thank you for everything,

640
00:33:58,654 --> 00:33:59,903
Kang Ho.

641
00:34:07,164 --> 00:34:08,544
That hillbilly...

642
00:34:09,734 --> 00:34:11,814
plays her character just like...

643
00:34:12,934 --> 00:34:14,113
Do Ra used to.

644
00:34:18,344 --> 00:34:20,053
Why am I feeling this way?

645
00:34:23,214 --> 00:34:24,493
What on earth?

646
00:34:26,014 --> 00:34:29,933
(Open audition for "Passion")

647
00:34:32,523 --> 00:34:33,603
Miss.

648
00:34:34,353 --> 00:34:35,533
Can we have a word?

649
00:34:37,924 --> 00:34:39,174
What now?

650
00:34:39,623 --> 00:34:41,933
Don't you dare pull my hair again.

651
00:34:41,933 --> 00:34:44,134
I won't hold back this time around.

652
00:34:44,134 --> 00:34:45,413
Come on.

653
00:34:45,734 --> 00:34:47,944
I only want to have some tea
with you.

654
00:34:48,373 --> 00:34:49,453
What?

655
00:34:49,873 --> 00:34:52,574
Why would I have tea with you?

656
00:34:52,574 --> 00:34:54,714
It's not like you and I
are close enough...

657
00:34:54,714 --> 00:34:56,524
to enjoy tea together.

658
00:34:57,313 --> 00:34:59,263
Fine. We'll talk here, then.

659
00:34:59,543 --> 00:35:00,893
Unbelievable.

660
00:35:01,384 --> 00:35:02,464
You see,

661
00:35:03,853 --> 00:35:04,933
this is who I am.

662
00:35:07,424 --> 00:35:08,504
So?

663
00:35:08,694 --> 00:35:09,993
Come on.

664
00:35:09,993 --> 00:35:12,223
I'm sure you know
actress Park Do Ra.

665
00:35:12,223 --> 00:35:15,094
I'm Baek Entertainment's
CEO Baek Mi Ja.

666
00:35:15,094 --> 00:35:16,764
The one who made Do Ra
the star she was.

667
00:35:16,764 --> 00:35:17,844
And?

668
00:35:18,304 --> 00:35:20,183
You little brat.

669
00:35:20,464 --> 00:35:21,553
Miss.

670
00:35:22,004 --> 00:35:23,004
Join my agency.

671
00:35:23,004 --> 00:35:25,043
I'll make you a star.

672
00:35:25,043 --> 00:35:27,873
Forget it, lady.

673
00:35:27,873 --> 00:35:31,294
I'd choose not to go into acting
rather than sign with your agency.

674
00:35:31,714 --> 00:35:33,393
I'm a woman of dignity.

675
00:35:34,953 --> 00:35:37,334
Why that... Seriously?

676
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:43,274
But she has what it takes.

677
00:35:45,723 --> 00:35:48,913
Hold on. Do Sik also said this,

678
00:35:49,833 --> 00:35:51,614
but why do I see Do Ra in her?

679
00:35:53,004 --> 00:35:55,013
How peculiar.

680
00:35:59,563 --> 00:36:00,643
Ji Young.

681
00:36:06,232 --> 00:36:09,183
Why are you still here, Director Ko?

682
00:36:09,873 --> 00:36:11,152
Did you do well at your audition?

683
00:36:12,572 --> 00:36:15,453
I was so nervous
that I can't even remember how I did.

684
00:36:16,712 --> 00:36:21,088
My legs are still like jelly,
and my head's spinning.

685
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:24,562
The fact that I was at an audition
doesn't seem real at all.

686
00:36:25,422 --> 00:36:26,672
When will they post the result?

687
00:36:26,993 --> 00:36:28,933
By the end of this week.

688
00:36:29,223 --> 00:36:32,462
But honestly,
I'm not getting my hopes up.

689
00:36:32,462 --> 00:36:34,833
My heart is about to burst...

690
00:36:34,833 --> 00:36:37,063
just because I was able to audition.

691
00:36:37,063 --> 00:36:38,703
It's as if I became
that character just now,

692
00:36:38,703 --> 00:36:39,902
and my body is tingling.

693
00:36:39,902 --> 00:36:42,333
I had so much fun...

694
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:44,882
that I don't mind
not getting the role.

695
00:36:46,572 --> 00:36:50,243
Were you excited to the point
that your heart almost burst?

696
00:36:50,243 --> 00:36:51,462
Yes.

697
00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:56,962
Why do you keep asking me
how it was?

698
00:36:58,123 --> 00:36:59,159
Why?

699
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:01,732
I bet you wanted me to flop.

700
00:37:02,223 --> 00:37:04,042
That's why you want to know
how I did.

701
00:37:05,063 --> 00:37:06,203
That's right.

702
00:37:06,362 --> 00:37:09,063
I bet I didn't get the role
because you prayed...

703
00:37:09,063 --> 00:37:10,482
that I wouldn't.

704
00:37:11,132 --> 00:37:12,243
That's wrong.

705
00:37:12,962 --> 00:37:14,712
I prayed for your success.

706
00:37:16,473 --> 00:37:17,623
Really?

707
00:37:17,842 --> 00:37:18,922
Yes.

708
00:37:19,643 --> 00:37:21,723
After we talked last night,

709
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:23,422
I gave it a lot of thought.

710
00:37:24,382 --> 00:37:25,792
It's what you badly want to do,

711
00:37:26,512 --> 00:37:28,913
so what gives me the right
to stop you...

712
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,433
from doing what excites you?

713
00:37:31,453 --> 00:37:34,033
Many of us don't know
what we want in life,

714
00:37:34,993 --> 00:37:37,203
but you found something
you're passionate about.

715
00:37:38,462 --> 00:37:40,573
It didn't seem right
to get in your way.

716
00:37:43,703 --> 00:37:44,842
Well...

717
00:37:45,603 --> 00:37:48,453
You changed
so drastically overnight...

718
00:37:49,103 --> 00:37:50,482
which is hard to adapt to.

719
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:52,283
Last night,

720
00:37:53,243 --> 00:37:55,152
I said those things out of concern.

721
00:37:55,813 --> 00:37:57,123
I'm truly worried about you.

722
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,723
Gosh.

723
00:38:00,413 --> 00:38:03,303
You must make it a habit
to be worried.

724
00:38:03,822 --> 00:38:05,623
Just look at me.

725
00:38:05,623 --> 00:38:09,272
I could never think to go that far.

726
00:38:09,723 --> 00:38:12,762
Besides, even if
something like that happens to me,

727
00:38:12,762 --> 00:38:14,663
I can go home to my grandma...

728
00:38:14,663 --> 00:38:16,333
and live my life quietly...

729
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:18,442
catching octopus
and harvesting clams,

730
00:38:18,762 --> 00:38:20,783
so don't worry about me.

731
00:38:22,232 --> 00:38:23,652
We should go somewhere.

732
00:38:24,672 --> 00:38:25,752
Where?

733
00:38:26,302 --> 00:38:27,792
Since you're doing this,

734
00:38:28,012 --> 00:38:30,823
I'll take you to a place
that could help you.

735
00:38:42,692 --> 00:38:44,643
What? No, I shouldn't.

736
00:38:48,071 --> 00:38:51,662
("Ma Ri's Prince")

737
00:39:08,982 --> 00:39:11,528
No, Ma Ri. Don't do that.

738
00:39:11,552 --> 00:39:12,962
Please don't come by
my workplace again.

739
00:39:13,223 --> 00:39:15,023
If this is how it's going to be,

740
00:39:15,023 --> 00:39:17,172
I won't be able to consider you
even as a sister.

741
00:39:18,793 --> 00:39:20,893
I was sad to hear that,

742
00:39:20,893 --> 00:39:22,692
but I'm not upset with him anymore.

743
00:39:22,692 --> 00:39:24,103
I love how prickly he is.

744
00:39:24,103 --> 00:39:26,513
He's like a protagonist
from a romance novel.

745
00:39:30,273 --> 00:39:33,512
But I really want to marry Mr. Ko.

746
00:39:33,512 --> 00:39:35,223
Could there be a way?

747
00:39:41,413 --> 00:39:42,753
Yes, that's it.

748
00:39:42,753 --> 00:39:45,502
That way, I could marry him.

749
00:40:30,163 --> 00:40:31,382
What's this?

750
00:40:33,802 --> 00:40:37,022
"Mom, Dad.
Don't worry about Gong Ma Ri."

751
00:40:37,672 --> 00:40:39,853
"I'll return after
my important plan is done."

752
00:40:40,612 --> 00:40:42,053
My goodness.

753
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,763
Madam Jang!

754
00:40:46,612 --> 00:40:49,692
Do Jun.
Ma Ri left without her phone...

755
00:40:50,052 --> 00:40:51,502
and only left this note.

756
00:40:52,353 --> 00:40:54,873
Did she tell you anything?

757
00:40:55,092 --> 00:40:56,402
Do you have any ideas?

758
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,723
She has only been to art class...

759
00:40:58,723 --> 00:41:01,092
and to visit your friend
in Heukseok-dong.

760
00:41:01,092 --> 00:41:02,573
She didn't care about anything else.

761
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,683
- Really?
- Yes.

762
00:41:07,973 --> 00:41:09,053
But...

763
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:13,522
she did say something odd.

764
00:41:15,043 --> 00:41:16,192
What did she say?

765
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:17,993
That drama director.

766
00:41:18,543 --> 00:41:20,962
She said she planned to make him
a prince husband.

767
00:41:23,012 --> 00:41:25,562
A "prince husband?" What plan?

768
00:41:26,152 --> 00:41:28,632
I asked but she said
she'd tell me later.

769
00:41:31,462 --> 00:41:33,672
Okay. You can go to your room.

770
00:41:33,862 --> 00:41:34,973
Okay.

771
00:41:38,902 --> 00:41:40,453
Then did she leave...

772
00:41:40,802 --> 00:41:43,112
to make Pil Seung a prince husband?

773
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:44,703
Goodness.

774
00:41:44,703 --> 00:41:46,623
She gets such strange ideas.

775
00:41:46,842 --> 00:41:49,092
She was and will be
a nuisance her whole life.

776
00:41:49,842 --> 00:41:50,922
Darn it.

777
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:53,632
Goodness.

778
00:41:58,322 --> 00:42:00,272
Did she really go to see Pil Seung?

779
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,961
(Pil Seung)

780
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:07,373
No.

781
00:42:07,532 --> 00:42:10,712
If he'd met Ma Ri,
he'd have called me.

782
00:42:14,373 --> 00:42:15,482
Goodness.

783
00:42:18,942 --> 00:42:20,053
Hey.

784
00:42:22,112 --> 00:42:23,362
Hi, Soo Yeon.

785
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:25,862
Sun Young.

786
00:42:26,882 --> 00:42:29,362
I'm sorry to ask,
but is Ma Ri at your place?

787
00:42:30,453 --> 00:42:32,562
No, she didn't come by. Why?

788
00:42:34,092 --> 00:42:36,433
What? Ma Ri's gone missing?

789
00:42:37,822 --> 00:42:39,172
Okay.

790
00:42:39,293 --> 00:42:42,013
I'll call you right away
if she comes here.

791
00:42:42,663 --> 00:42:44,212
Okay, bye.

792
00:42:48,172 --> 00:42:50,252
Where did she go?

793
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:54,652
I hope nothing bad happens.

794
00:43:29,143 --> 00:43:32,112
I love Mr. Ko's room.

795
00:43:32,112 --> 00:43:33,292
It's so cozy.

796
00:43:39,482 --> 00:43:41,772
But why is he never around?

797
00:43:52,032 --> 00:43:53,112
Honey.

798
00:43:53,473 --> 00:43:55,513
Shouldn't we file
a missing person's report?

799
00:43:56,572 --> 00:43:59,422
She left a note
telling us not to worry.

800
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:00,692
Let's wait a little longer.

801
00:44:34,342 --> 00:44:35,692
What's this noise?

802
00:44:36,442 --> 00:44:37,823
The room's empty.

803
00:44:48,192 --> 00:44:49,732
Am I hearing things?

804
00:45:00,703 --> 00:45:03,882
Gosh. That was so close.

805
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:10,993
Why isn't Mr. Ko home yet?

806
00:45:11,813 --> 00:45:13,493
I'm so sleepy,

807
00:45:14,012 --> 00:45:15,592
and it's cramped in here.

808
00:45:24,023 --> 00:45:26,103
I hold you in my arms.

809
00:45:28,493 --> 00:45:30,778
Time means nothing.

810
00:45:30,802 --> 00:45:32,683
I hold you to my chest.

811
00:45:33,262 --> 00:45:36,152
Our youngest son Jeon Seung.

812
00:45:38,672 --> 00:45:40,252
He doesn't know anything.

813
00:45:41,973 --> 00:45:43,922
He can't tell a dream from reality.

814
00:45:49,382 --> 00:45:50,663
How was the play?

815
00:45:51,353 --> 00:45:55,303
Director.
I think the actors are so smart.

816
00:45:55,393 --> 00:45:57,692
How do they memorize
all those words...

817
00:45:57,692 --> 00:46:00,023
and make people laugh and then cry?

818
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:01,243
How do they do that?

819
00:46:01,563 --> 00:46:03,632
Just the thought
of being on stage...

820
00:46:03,632 --> 00:46:05,783
made me so nervous
my mind went blank.

821
00:46:06,503 --> 00:46:08,783
I could never do that
in this lifetime.

822
00:46:09,273 --> 00:46:11,053
That's why I told you not to.

823
00:46:11,442 --> 00:46:13,473
You wanted to get into acting
without considering that?

824
00:46:13,473 --> 00:46:15,823
Why do you nag
whenever you get the chance?

825
00:46:17,143 --> 00:46:19,292
You could at least teach me first.

826
00:46:21,982 --> 00:46:23,062
Ji Young.

827
00:46:24,223 --> 00:46:26,402
Listen carefully to what I say.

828
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:30,172
Okay.

829
00:46:30,362 --> 00:46:32,873
First, you must ditch the dialect.

830
00:46:33,322 --> 00:46:36,112
I'm working on that right...

831
00:46:36,762 --> 00:46:37,838
now.

832
00:46:37,862 --> 00:46:39,643
This was the first play
you saw, right?

833
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:42,873
Yes.

834
00:46:42,873 --> 00:46:45,522
How could an actor wannabe
not see any plays?

835
00:46:45,973 --> 00:46:48,373
Go and see many plays and movies.

836
00:46:48,373 --> 00:46:49,522
And watch dramas too.

837
00:46:49,712 --> 00:46:51,789
When you're on a street,
in a cafe, or in a store,

838
00:46:51,813 --> 00:46:53,663
don't just walk about mindlessly.

839
00:46:53,753 --> 00:46:57,203
Carefully observe how people talk
and what faces they make.

840
00:46:57,652 --> 00:47:00,232
And watch the news when you can.

841
00:47:00,523 --> 00:47:02,172
You need to know what's going on.

842
00:47:02,353 --> 00:47:04,603
And you must read lots of books.

843
00:47:04,862 --> 00:47:07,063
You can tell an actor
who has read a lot...

844
00:47:07,063 --> 00:47:08,262
from one who hasn't.

845
00:47:08,262 --> 00:47:10,342
The bottom line is
you can't be ignorant.

846
00:47:10,802 --> 00:47:11,913
"Ignorant?"

847
00:47:13,203 --> 00:47:15,283
Is that what you're calling me?

848
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:19,143
I don't know why...

849
00:47:19,143 --> 00:47:21,522
I came all the way here to hear this.

850
00:47:21,813 --> 00:47:22,993
That darn dialect again.

851
00:47:23,243 --> 00:47:25,212
I've talked like this my whole life.

852
00:47:25,212 --> 00:47:26,792
I can't change
how I speak overnight.

853
00:47:27,112 --> 00:47:29,362
- Can I?
- You have to.

854
00:47:29,453 --> 00:47:31,732
If you want to act, do it properly.

855
00:47:31,953 --> 00:47:34,873
You can't be a good actor
with a mindset like that.

856
00:47:38,393 --> 00:47:39,672
I won't eat.

857
00:47:40,563 --> 00:47:44,083
Even dogs are allowed
to eat in peace.

858
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:48,212
If you nag
at the end of every comment,

859
00:47:48,773 --> 00:47:50,882
how am I to even swallow a mouthful?

860
00:47:52,172 --> 00:47:54,893
You're the king of nagging.
The complete worst.

861
00:47:57,683 --> 00:47:58,792
Sit back down.

862
00:47:59,282 --> 00:48:01,462
I won't say a word while you eat.

863
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:02,833
Finish your noodles.

864
00:48:04,552 --> 00:48:07,232
I heard your stomach rumble.

865
00:48:08,023 --> 00:48:10,203
Don't regret it later
and eat while you can.

866
00:48:17,433 --> 00:48:20,212
Gosh, the broth is amazing.

867
00:48:20,603 --> 00:48:21,712
It's so good.

868
00:48:34,212 --> 00:48:35,333
It is good.

869
00:48:47,833 --> 00:48:48,942
Director.

870
00:48:50,402 --> 00:48:54,453
You helped me out a lot today.

871
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:56,183
Thank you.

872
00:48:57,273 --> 00:48:59,283
- Good night.
- Wait, Ji Young.

873
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:12,433
Ji Young.
Good job with the audition.

874
00:49:12,623 --> 00:49:15,373
This is a gift to commend you
for your hard work.

875
00:49:17,563 --> 00:49:19,573
Thank you.

876
00:49:20,462 --> 00:49:22,973
Why would you give me flowers
for attending an audition?

877
00:49:23,663 --> 00:49:25,442
The finale to any date
should be flowers.

878
00:49:26,762 --> 00:49:28,453
What date?

879
00:49:28,672 --> 00:49:31,942
All I did today was see a play
and get an earful from you.

880
00:49:31,942 --> 00:49:33,273
How is that a date?

881
00:49:33,273 --> 00:49:36,493
Don't even use
that embarrassing word.

882
00:49:37,282 --> 00:49:38,362
Ji Young.

883
00:49:39,083 --> 00:49:40,763
Who took you to the audition today?

884
00:49:41,753 --> 00:49:45,333
I was forced to ride with you,

885
00:49:45,583 --> 00:49:48,052
but I gave you the taxi fare.

886
00:49:48,052 --> 00:49:51,192
Either way, I got you there in time.

887
00:49:51,192 --> 00:49:52,262
You did.

888
00:49:52,262 --> 00:49:55,269
And the play we watched
helped you too.

889
00:49:55,293 --> 00:49:57,382
Yes. It did.

890
00:49:57,962 --> 00:50:00,882
Ji Young. That's a date.

891
00:50:03,802 --> 00:50:04,922
I...

892
00:50:05,873 --> 00:50:07,553
really like you a lot.

893
00:50:09,643 --> 00:50:12,522
Whenever you're in need
or in trouble,

894
00:50:12,583 --> 00:50:13,823
I want to help...

895
00:50:15,253 --> 00:50:16,763
and be there for you.

896
00:50:19,152 --> 00:50:20,333
What did you say?

897
00:50:22,223 --> 00:50:23,873
And you like me too.

898
00:50:24,793 --> 00:50:27,243
I'm not sure what's holding you back,

899
00:50:28,563 --> 00:50:32,712
but I want you
to pluck up your courage now.

900
00:50:34,172 --> 00:50:35,252
That's right.

901
00:50:35,902 --> 00:50:37,882
I like you too.

902
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:43,893
Director Ko.

903
00:50:45,442 --> 00:50:49,632
I'm not good enough for you
in many ways.

904
00:50:50,253 --> 00:50:52,062
So please stop stirring my heart.

905
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:56,103
We can't say who's not good enough
for whom when we like each other.

906
00:50:57,163 --> 00:50:58,873
Things like that don't matter
when it comes to love.

907
00:51:01,293 --> 00:51:02,413
Ji Young.

908
00:51:03,092 --> 00:51:04,842
You laughed a lot
because of me today.

909
00:51:05,703 --> 00:51:07,712
And you liked the noodles
you had with me.

910
00:51:08,503 --> 00:51:10,783
You are pleased and happy
when you're with me.

911
00:51:11,543 --> 00:51:14,123
Let's just go out as we did today.

912
00:51:16,143 --> 00:51:18,183
This is our first day as a couple.
It's settled.

913
00:51:18,183 --> 00:51:20,592
You can't take it back. Good night.

914
00:51:22,052 --> 00:51:25,263
Okay. You have a good night too...

915
00:51:26,282 --> 00:51:27,329
What?

916
00:51:27,353 --> 00:51:29,353
No, I take it back.

917
00:51:29,353 --> 00:51:32,942
I take back that I said okay.

918
00:51:50,243 --> 00:51:52,493
Kim Ji Young,
have you lost your mind?

919
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:56,152
"Okay. You have a good night too."

920
00:51:56,152 --> 00:51:57,922
Why would you say such a thing?

921
00:51:57,922 --> 00:52:00,033
Do you think this is the first day?

922
00:52:01,422 --> 00:52:05,172
No, there's no way.
Why would you go out with him?

923
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:09,243
I guess I fell for his smooth moves
for a moment today,

924
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:11,882
but it won't happen again.

925
00:52:13,063 --> 00:52:14,353
Director Ko is...

926
00:52:15,672 --> 00:52:16,812
such a fox.

927
00:52:17,643 --> 00:52:19,553
A fox that bewitches me.

928
00:52:21,313 --> 00:52:22,522
Kim Ji Young.

929
00:52:23,043 --> 00:52:25,893
You better pull yourself together.

930
00:52:40,933 --> 00:52:43,073
Keep it together.

931
00:52:56,512 --> 00:52:58,543
This is our first day as a couple.
It's settled.

932
00:52:58,543 --> 00:53:00,763
You can't take it back. Good night.

933
00:53:02,353 --> 00:53:05,533
Okay. You have a good night too...

934
00:53:06,623 --> 00:53:07,623
What?

935
00:53:07,623 --> 00:53:11,303
No, I take it back.
I take back that I said okay.

936
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:14,473
She pretends she doesn't like me,
but I know she's into me.

937
00:53:15,462 --> 00:53:16,643
How cute.

938
00:53:17,732 --> 00:53:21,152
Why has she been acting like that
when she had feelings for me?

939
00:53:39,683 --> 00:53:40,933
What is this sound?

940
00:53:42,723 --> 00:53:44,973
Did I forget to turn off the music?

941
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:49,743
That's not it.

942
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:57,083
I guess I was mistaken.

943
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:08,062
What am I hearing?

944
00:54:10,212 --> 00:54:11,833
I think someone's snoring.

945
00:54:22,732 --> 00:54:23,973
Is it a ghost?

946
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:28,252
Or a thief?

947
00:54:49,393 --> 00:54:52,143
Mom! Dad!

948
00:54:58,933 --> 00:55:00,183
My gosh.

949
00:55:01,032 --> 00:55:02,212
Mom!

950
00:55:03,132 --> 00:55:04,323
Dad!

951
00:55:05,342 --> 00:55:07,373
- Pil Seung, what's wrong?
- Where is it?

952
00:55:07,373 --> 00:55:09,342
Hey, where's the thief?

953
00:55:09,342 --> 00:55:10,643
Pil Seung, where is it?

954
00:55:10,643 --> 00:55:11,823
What...

955
00:55:12,243 --> 00:55:13,813
- You...
- My goodness.

956
00:55:13,813 --> 00:55:15,552
- My gosh. Ma Ri.
- Ma Ri?

957
00:55:15,552 --> 00:55:17,052
- That's Ma Ri.
- What?

958
00:55:17,052 --> 00:55:19,062
My gosh. I was so startled.

959
00:55:21,293 --> 00:55:23,002
- How...
- Oh, dear.

960
00:55:24,052 --> 00:55:27,192
My goodness. Ma Ri.

961
00:55:27,192 --> 00:55:29,663
What were you doing in there?

962
00:55:29,663 --> 00:55:31,942
How long have you been in there?

963
00:55:32,333 --> 00:55:36,353
Well... So the thing is... I was...

964
00:55:37,103 --> 00:55:38,873
Pil Seung, what happened?

965
00:55:38,873 --> 00:55:39,873
I have no idea.

966
00:55:39,873 --> 00:55:42,223
When I lay down to sleep,
I heard a strange noise.

967
00:55:42,942 --> 00:55:45,163
It turns out
she was snoring in the closet.

968
00:55:45,543 --> 00:55:47,413
It frightened the life out of me.

969
00:55:47,413 --> 00:55:48,782
My gosh.

970
00:55:48,782 --> 00:55:51,282
I also heard it
when I came into your room...

971
00:55:51,282 --> 00:55:52,732
to leave your clothes.

972
00:55:52,953 --> 00:55:54,453
Ma Ri, have you been...

973
00:55:54,453 --> 00:55:56,873
hiding in the closet
since the afternoon?

974
00:55:58,023 --> 00:55:59,023
Yes.

975
00:55:59,023 --> 00:56:02,942
But why?
Why did you do such a thing?

976
00:56:05,103 --> 00:56:07,913
Because I wanted to marry Mr. Ko.

977
00:56:08,203 --> 00:56:10,513
- What?
- What?

978
00:56:12,873 --> 00:56:15,773
If I spend a night with him,

979
00:56:15,773 --> 00:56:18,163
he will have no choice
but to marry me.

980
00:56:18,882 --> 00:56:20,962
That's why I was hiding in there,

981
00:56:21,083 --> 00:56:23,192
but I ended up falling asleep.

982
00:56:24,523 --> 00:56:26,062
I'm such a fool.

983
00:56:26,753 --> 00:56:27,873
My gosh.

984
00:56:30,023 --> 00:56:31,902
- My goodness.
- Gosh.

985
00:56:44,802 --> 00:56:46,752
Hello, Sun Young.

986
00:56:52,512 --> 00:56:53,663
What?

987
00:56:54,413 --> 00:56:56,092
Ma Ri has been hiding...

988
00:56:56,453 --> 00:56:58,933
in Pil Seung's closet so far?

989
00:56:59,023 --> 00:57:00,353
- Let go of me.
- Ma Ri.

990
00:57:00,353 --> 00:57:01,652
- I don't want to go.
- Why are you being like this?

991
00:57:01,652 --> 00:57:03,523
I'm not leaving. Mr. Ko.

992
00:57:03,523 --> 00:57:05,269
- Let go of me.
- Stop calling him.

993
00:57:05,293 --> 00:57:07,993
Pil Seung, you should go back
to your room. I'm sorry.

994
00:57:07,993 --> 00:57:09,333
- Let's go, honey.
- Wait.

995
00:57:09,333 --> 00:57:11,433
- What do you mean "wait?" Just go.
- Hang on.

996
00:57:11,433 --> 00:57:13,402
- Go to your room.
- Are you okay? What's wrong?

997
00:57:13,402 --> 00:57:14,482
Ma Ri.

998
00:57:15,833 --> 00:57:17,373
- Let's go home.
- Get off me.

999
00:57:17,373 --> 00:57:19,572
I don't want to go.
Can't I crash here tonight?

1000
00:57:19,572 --> 00:57:21,873
- Ma Ri.
- Ma Ri, you want to get in trouble?

1001
00:57:21,873 --> 00:57:23,723
How dare you say such a thing?

1002
00:57:24,282 --> 00:57:26,212
Please let her stay here.

1003
00:57:26,212 --> 00:57:28,253
She can sleep in my room.

1004
00:57:28,253 --> 00:57:29,612
Just let her do what she wants.

1005
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:32,523
Gosh, no. I'm really sorry.

1006
00:57:32,523 --> 00:57:34,083
Grandma says I can stay.

1007
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:35,793
She's my friend.

1008
00:57:35,793 --> 00:57:38,293
I don't want to go home.
I want to stay here.

1009
00:57:38,293 --> 00:57:39,663
Why are you... My gosh.

1010
00:57:39,663 --> 00:57:42,663
What's wrong with you?
Why are you acting like a child?

1011
00:57:42,663 --> 00:57:44,933
You can't be making a fuss
at this time of night.

1012
00:57:44,933 --> 00:57:48,103
Please don't scold Ma Ri
too harshly.

1013
00:57:48,103 --> 00:57:49,982
We don't mind her staying here.

1014
00:57:50,473 --> 00:57:52,853
I don't even know
how to apologize to you.

1015
00:57:53,402 --> 00:57:55,072
I'm really sorry...

1016
00:57:55,072 --> 00:57:57,623
that my daughter is making a fuss
and keeping you up at this hour.

1017
00:57:57,842 --> 00:58:00,413
It's okay. We really don't mind.

1018
00:58:00,413 --> 00:58:02,462
Please don't worry about us.

1019
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:05,623
I'm sorry, Sun Young.

1020
00:58:05,623 --> 00:58:07,723
Hyun Chul, I apologize.

1021
00:58:07,723 --> 00:58:10,523
- It's really okay.
- Gosh.

1022
00:58:10,523 --> 00:58:12,262
We will get going then.

1023
00:58:12,262 --> 00:58:14,223
- Good night.
- All right.

1024
00:58:14,223 --> 00:58:15,592
- Good night.
- Good night.

1025
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:17,073
- Let's go.
- Ma Ri, let's go.

1026
00:58:25,273 --> 00:58:28,853
Gong Ma Ri, why did you go there?

1027
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:33,522
Why were you hiding
in Pil Seung's closet all day?

1028
00:58:34,313 --> 00:58:36,813
Mom, I'm really upset.

1029
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:39,083
I was going to spend a night
with Mr. Ko.

1030
00:58:39,083 --> 00:58:41,723
But I fell asleep
and started snoring.

1031
00:58:41,723 --> 00:58:44,172
So Pil Seung found me
and my plan failed.

1032
00:58:44,293 --> 00:58:48,042
Gosh, Ma Ri! What did you just say?

1033
00:58:48,433 --> 00:58:50,312
You were going to spend a night
with Pil Seung?

1034
00:58:51,003 --> 00:58:54,232
Yes. I wanted to make a baby
with Mr. Ko.

1035
00:58:54,232 --> 00:58:56,302
If I spend a night with him
and make a baby,

1036
00:58:56,302 --> 00:58:57,572
we can get married.

1037
00:58:57,572 --> 00:58:58,652
Hey!

1038
00:58:58,973 --> 00:59:00,572
Honey, what do you think
you're doing?

1039
00:59:00,572 --> 00:59:02,342
She says she was going
to spend a night with Pil Seung!

1040
00:59:02,342 --> 00:59:03,973
She wanted to make a baby with him!

1041
00:59:03,973 --> 00:59:05,413
- Honey.
- Come here!

1042
00:59:05,413 --> 00:59:08,393
But you can't slap her like this.

1043
00:59:08,583 --> 00:59:12,002
I hate you! Why did you hit me?

1044
00:59:12,123 --> 00:59:14,592
I just wanted to sleep with
the man I liked.

1045
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:15,902
What's wrong with that?

1046
00:59:16,353 --> 00:59:17,793
That's what...

1047
00:59:17,793 --> 00:59:20,842
the main characters
in a romance novel do.

1048
00:59:21,132 --> 00:59:24,333
I'm going to do whatever it takes...

1049
00:59:24,333 --> 00:59:26,262
for me to marry Mr. Ko.

1050
00:59:26,262 --> 00:59:30,232
I really like Mr. Ko!
I want to marry him!

1051
00:59:30,232 --> 00:59:32,723
- You can't!
- Honey.

1052
00:59:33,072 --> 00:59:34,179
Honey, please.

1053
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:35,522
Let go of me!

1054
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:37,993
Honey.

1055
00:59:52,623 --> 00:59:55,913
What do I do?
What am I supposed to do?

1056
00:59:56,462 --> 00:59:59,139
What should I do with her?

1057
00:59:59,163 --> 01:00:00,712
What do I do?

1058
01:00:02,802 --> 01:00:03,953
What do I do?

1059
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:28,442
Mom, where are we going?

1060
01:00:29,692 --> 01:00:32,083
Are you going to beat me up
when Dad's not around?

1061
01:00:32,302 --> 01:00:33,643
Are you going to pinch me?

1062
01:00:35,232 --> 01:00:37,553
I won't change my mind
no matter what you do.

1063
01:00:38,342 --> 01:00:40,723
Do anything to hurt me,
and I'll tell Dad.

1064
01:00:58,862 --> 01:01:01,542
Mom, why did you bring me here?

1065
01:01:04,462 --> 01:01:06,603
There aren't any people here,
and I'm scared.

1066
01:01:06,603 --> 01:01:08,013
Let's hurry home.

1067
01:01:08,203 --> 01:01:10,053
I want to go home.

1068
01:01:13,442 --> 01:01:15,553
Are you going to keep
throwing yourself at Pil Seung?

1069
01:01:17,043 --> 01:01:18,922
Will there be a repeat of yesterday?

1070
01:01:20,683 --> 01:01:23,562
Yes, I'll throw myself at him
until he marries me.

1071
01:01:28,723 --> 01:01:29,803
Ma Ri.

1072
01:01:31,092 --> 01:01:32,402
You can't marry Pil Seung.

1073
01:01:33,993 --> 01:01:35,143
Why not?

1074
01:01:35,232 --> 01:01:38,283
Am I that wrong to like Mr. Ko?

1075
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:41,732
I'd be crossing the line
if he had a girlfriend,

1076
01:01:41,732 --> 01:01:42,873
but he doesn't.

1077
01:01:42,873 --> 01:01:44,553
I'm allowed to like him.

1078
01:01:44,773 --> 01:01:47,773
You married Dad who you liked,

1079
01:01:47,773 --> 01:01:48,953
so why can't I have that too?

1080
01:01:50,342 --> 01:01:51,562
Ma Ri, you...

1081
01:01:52,342 --> 01:01:54,223
You can't like Pil Seung.

1082
01:01:55,012 --> 01:01:58,232
Even if Pil Seung likes you back,

1083
01:01:59,982 --> 01:02:02,192
you two can never get married.

1084
01:02:02,192 --> 01:02:03,833
It can never happen.

1085
01:02:04,052 --> 01:02:05,568
Why not?

1086
01:02:05,592 --> 01:02:08,842
But I want to marry him at all costs.

1087
01:02:10,732 --> 01:02:11,842
Ma Ri.

1088
01:02:14,132 --> 01:02:15,283
Pil Seung...

1089
01:02:20,043 --> 01:02:21,323
is your brother.

1090
01:02:22,143 --> 01:02:23,323
He's your biological brother.

1091
01:02:27,782 --> 01:02:28,962
My biological brother?

1092
01:02:29,583 --> 01:02:31,192
What do you mean by that?

1093
01:02:39,123 --> 01:02:40,973
Ji Young, it's bad!

1094
01:02:41,993 --> 01:02:43,993
Why? Did something happen?

1095
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:46,703
It's an urgent matter,
so I'll tell you on the way there.

1096
01:02:46,703 --> 01:02:47,783
Hurry!

1097
01:02:53,473 --> 01:02:55,553
- Your seat belt.
- What? Oh, right.

1098
01:03:06,382 --> 01:03:07,833
What on earth is it?

1099
01:03:07,922 --> 01:03:09,333
Is it something bad?

1100
01:03:09,422 --> 01:03:12,073
I got us movie tickets,
and we needed to hurry...

1101
01:03:12,293 --> 01:03:13,573
to have time to buy popcorn.

1102
01:03:15,192 --> 01:03:16,312
Director,

1103
01:03:16,893 --> 01:03:18,842
was that the urgent business?

1104
01:03:19,732 --> 01:03:21,683
Did you just con me?

1105
01:03:23,072 --> 01:03:25,422
Con you?
That's a harsh way to put it.

1106
01:03:25,942 --> 01:03:27,603
I only said that...

1107
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:30,323
because it'd be a waste
to be late to see a movie.

1108
01:03:33,813 --> 01:03:35,462
I'm such an idiot.

1109
01:03:36,183 --> 01:03:38,002
I let him play me again.

1110
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:40,562
Director Ko, you liar.

1111
01:03:41,493 --> 01:03:44,373
But he's such a cute liar.

1112
01:03:45,293 --> 01:03:47,842
Should I let myself like him?

1113
01:03:48,262 --> 01:03:49,942
No way.

1114
01:03:49,993 --> 01:03:51,738
I shouldn't fall for him.

1115
01:03:51,762 --> 01:03:53,982
I wouldn't be able
to look at Ms. Kim anymore.

1116
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,723
Will he still accept me...

1117
01:03:59,243 --> 01:04:01,353
if I tell him how I feel
after I make it as an actor?

1118
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:06,422
Should I ask him
to wait for me until then?

1119
01:04:18,762 --> 01:04:20,002
Wasn't the movie enjoyable?

1120
01:04:20,123 --> 01:04:22,732
It was. The movie itself was great,

1121
01:04:22,732 --> 01:04:25,112
but I was mesmerized by the actors.

1122
01:04:25,333 --> 01:04:28,583
I want to know
how one can perform like that.

1123
01:04:29,333 --> 01:04:32,482
To be a good actor,
you need to watch a lot of movies.

1124
01:04:33,143 --> 01:04:36,292
Let's keep seeing
many movies together.

1125
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:39,263
He's so nice to me...

1126
01:04:39,543 --> 01:04:41,893
that I can't help myself
from being swayed.

1127
01:04:43,753 --> 01:04:45,663
Should I let him
sweep me off my feet?

1128
01:04:46,723 --> 01:04:47,833
Pil Seung.

1129
01:04:48,853 --> 01:04:51,442
Did you give her a ride home again?

1130
01:04:53,092 --> 01:04:54,203
Ji Young.

1131
01:04:54,893 --> 01:04:56,973
I thought I made myself clear
the last time we spoke,

1132
01:04:57,032 --> 01:04:58,942
so why did you get in his car again?

1133
01:05:00,333 --> 01:05:02,252
Mom, what's wrong?

1134
01:05:07,074 --> 01:05:09,855
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1135
01:05:42,161 --> 01:05:45,292
I don't understand
anything you told me.

1136
01:05:45,292 --> 01:05:47,261
You're the worst, Mom.

1137
01:05:47,261 --> 01:05:48,661
How could you abandon a baby?

1138
01:05:48,661 --> 01:05:50,261
Don't be on Ji Young's case again.

1139
01:05:50,261 --> 01:05:51,902
I'm the one who likes her...

1140
01:05:51,902 --> 01:05:53,548
and wants to be with her.

1141
01:05:53,572 --> 01:05:55,672
Please don't fall for Pil Seung.

1142
01:05:55,672 --> 01:05:57,172
I'm begging you.

1143
01:05:57,172 --> 01:05:59,617
Your elders are right about this.

1144
01:05:59,641 --> 01:06:02,261
I'm not good enough for you.

1145
01:06:02,311 --> 01:06:05,081
Ji Young and I agreed to date
starting today,

1146
01:06:05,081 --> 01:06:06,652
so please respect her...

1147
01:06:06,652 --> 01:06:08,502
as my girlfriend from here on out.

1148
01:06:11,052 --> 01:06:13,172
