1
00:00:00,104 --> 00:00:07,293
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:09,969
I...

3
00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:13,038
I have no intention
of breaking up with her.

4
00:00:13,479 --> 00:00:14,778
(Episode 44)

5
00:00:14,778 --> 00:00:16,349
Also, I'm thinking...

6
00:00:17,078 --> 00:00:18,919
about marrying her.

7
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:23,618
What? You'll marry her?

8
00:00:25,089 --> 00:00:27,258
Says who?

9
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:31,488
Mr. Ko.

10
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:34,929
You're thinking about marrying her?
Do you mean that?

11
00:00:35,199 --> 00:00:36,799
Yes, sir.

12
00:00:37,298 --> 00:00:39,238
We agreed to marry...

13
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:41,608
after the last episode
of the drama series airs.

14
00:00:45,008 --> 00:00:47,238
Things aren't over
between Ji Young and me!

15
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:49,479
But...

16
00:00:50,048 --> 00:00:52,248
you're going to marry my woman?

17
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:55,089
Jin Taek, this is who he really is.

18
00:00:56,018 --> 00:00:59,759
Still, you're adamant
about adopting him.

19
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:02,888
A thug who shamelessly
steals other men's women.

20
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:05,604
Gong Jin Dan, watch your words.

21
00:01:05,628 --> 00:01:08,199
Jin Taek,
why won't you listen to me?

22
00:01:09,529 --> 00:01:11,528
Why are you always on my case?

23
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:13,199
Darn it.

24
00:01:18,838 --> 00:01:20,179
Mr. Ko.

25
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:23,479
Do you mean what you said?

26
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:27,819
Are you and that young lady
going to get married?

27
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:31,119
Yes, that's right.

28
00:01:34,989 --> 00:01:36,289
Oh my goodness.

29
00:01:36,929 --> 00:01:38,759
I can't believe it.

30
00:01:45,838 --> 00:01:47,339
- Kim Ji Young.
- What...

31
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,468
Are you getting married?

32
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:53,938
Did you really agree
to marry Ko Pil Seung?

33
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,418
Yes, I did. What about it?

34
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:01,619
"What about it?"

35
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:05,489
Hey, how can you get married?

36
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:07,218
Who are you to decide
on your marriage?

37
00:02:07,218 --> 00:02:08,358
And to another man?

38
00:02:08,358 --> 00:02:10,789
It's my decision
since I'm the one getting married.

39
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:12,575
Why ask what's obvious?

40
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,558
How is it your business?

41
00:02:14,558 --> 00:02:16,298
Of course, it's my business.

42
00:02:16,628 --> 00:02:19,639
Come on.
Things aren't over between us.

43
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,298
I'm not done with you.

44
00:02:21,538 --> 00:02:23,708
So how can you get married?

45
00:02:26,408 --> 00:02:28,185
There's something seriously wrong
with you.

46
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:29,509
What...

47
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:31,719
What was that?

48
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,588
You're not Kim Ji Young, are you?

49
00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:39,018
It seems as though...

50
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,729
you're not the Kim Ji Young
from before.

51
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:46,275
That's right. I'm Kang Ji Young,
not Kim Ji Young.

52
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:47,599
Satisfied?

53
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:50,828
What am I going to do with you?

54
00:02:51,028 --> 00:02:54,368
I'm suing you
for emotional and financial damage.

55
00:02:54,368 --> 00:02:55,838
You'd better be ready. Got it?

56
00:02:55,838 --> 00:02:57,409
Do whatever you want.

57
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,078
Wait.

58
00:03:00,778 --> 00:03:02,479
What's this ring?

59
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:04,794
Is it from Ko Pil Seung?

60
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:06,378
- Let go of me.
- Why are you wearing this?

61
00:03:06,378 --> 00:03:08,888
You sent back the necklace
I gave you?

62
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:11,289
It's not like
mine was dipped in feces.

63
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:12,819
Come here. Take that off.

64
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,719
Take it off.

65
00:03:18,628 --> 00:03:20,099
If you don't step aside,

66
00:03:20,498 --> 00:03:22,199
I'm calling the cops.

67
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:30,268
Fine. Whatever.

68
00:03:31,068 --> 00:03:33,979
We'll see if you can actually...

69
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:36,279
get married to him.

70
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:08,009
Jin Dan, what are you doing here?

71
00:04:09,179 --> 00:04:11,048
I have some business
to take care of,

72
00:04:11,348 --> 00:04:13,219
so don't mind me.

73
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,319
Jin Taek!

74
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:21,689
Jin Dan, wait. What are you doing?

75
00:04:22,088 --> 00:04:24,989
I'm utterly upset with you,
Jin Taek.

76
00:04:25,858 --> 00:04:28,598
How could you be so sweet
and generous with Ko Pil Seung...

77
00:04:28,598 --> 00:04:30,699
who is not even your family?

78
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:33,398
Meanwhile, you always give me
the cold shoulder.

79
00:04:34,238 --> 00:04:36,809
Our father Chairman Gong Dae Gil
will shed tears of blood...

80
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,538
if he sees all this from above.

81
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:41,978
When you greet him in the afterlife,

82
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:45,009
he will slap you across the face.

83
00:04:45,278 --> 00:04:48,689
Jin Taek, you should know that.

84
00:04:49,718 --> 00:04:52,958
What's going on?
Jin Dan, what's wrong?

85
00:04:53,788 --> 00:04:57,704
You said Ko Pil Seung and I
would become family,

86
00:04:57,728 --> 00:04:59,328
but that's absurd.

87
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,929
Let me tell you this loud and clear.

88
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,968
If you want to adopt Ko Pil Seung,

89
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:08,415
make him and Kim Ji Young
cancel their marriage.

90
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:10,439
If not, withdraw the adoption.

91
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:13,739
You'll only do one or the other.

92
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:16,485
What...

93
00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:18,379
What does he mean by that?

94
00:05:18,778 --> 00:05:21,778
Did Pil Seung really say
he would marry that young lady?

95
00:05:22,619 --> 00:05:26,119
From what I remember,
those two broke up.

96
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:28,504
Besides, how can he marry her...

97
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,358
when Jin Dan is in an uproar?

98
00:05:30,358 --> 00:05:31,999
That's absurd.

99
00:05:32,858 --> 00:05:35,929
I couldn't understand
the situation either,

100
00:05:36,028 --> 00:05:38,028
so I left after saying I heard him.

101
00:05:38,869 --> 00:05:42,108
How could you leave it at that?
Come on, honey.

102
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:45,408
You should've told him the marriage
was out of the question.

103
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,608
What gives me the right to say that?

104
00:05:47,608 --> 00:05:50,408
He's not officially my son yet.

105
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:54,454
Anyway, Mr. Ko is adamant.

106
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:56,949
He will marry her...

107
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,018
after the last episode
of "Seoul Lady" airs.

108
00:05:59,418 --> 00:06:02,059
My goodness. Did he really say that?

109
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:03,989
What?

110
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:06,859
You actually said that?

111
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:09,968
You'll marry Kim Ji Young?

112
00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:13,299
Yes.

113
00:06:14,238 --> 00:06:15,669
But...

114
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:17,869
How...

115
00:06:18,608 --> 00:06:22,049
How could you decide on this
without discussing it with us first?

116
00:06:23,848 --> 00:06:25,518
I was going...

117
00:06:25,678 --> 00:06:28,919
to tell everyone today,

118
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:32,788
but it just came up
when I was with Chairman Gong.

119
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:36,528
Anyway,

120
00:06:37,358 --> 00:06:40,528
Ji Young and I agreed to marry.

121
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:43,129
Hold on.

122
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:46,499
Have you already discussed marriage
with her?

123
00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:49,239
Did she say yes?

124
00:06:50,538 --> 00:06:51,869
Yes.

125
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:54,278
After the final episode airs,

126
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:55,879
we'll get married.

127
00:06:57,108 --> 00:06:59,918
That Kim Ji Young...

128
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:03,249
Didn't she recently
get engaged to Mr. Gong?

129
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:07,189
How could she even think to marry you?

130
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:11,228
My gosh. That is one shameless minx.

131
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:14,358
Grandma, the reporters
got it all wrong,

132
00:07:14,358 --> 00:07:16,828
so please don't get the wrong idea
about her.

133
00:07:17,098 --> 00:07:18,798
I trust her.

134
00:07:18,798 --> 00:07:20,168
As if.

135
00:07:20,168 --> 00:07:22,838
When she was our tenant,
Mr. Gong came by to see her.

136
00:07:22,838 --> 00:07:25,209
We all saw
how he caused a scene in our yard...

137
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:28,078
after drinking himself into oblivion
because of her.

138
00:07:28,238 --> 00:07:30,555
Pil Seung, you can't marry her.

139
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:33,949
Once Chairman Gong adopts you,

140
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,665
Mr. Gong will be
your uncle on paper.

141
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:39,588
This can't happen.

142
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:43,658
There's nothing going on
between Ji Young and Mr. Gong.

143
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:46,359
A misunderstanding occurred,

144
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:47,858
but it has been sorted out.

145
00:07:47,858 --> 00:07:51,069
So, please don't worry
if that is what's concerning you.

146
00:07:51,769 --> 00:07:54,439
Did you two jump the gun?

147
00:07:54,769 --> 00:07:56,109
Is she pregnant?

148
00:07:56,569 --> 00:07:58,908
Is that why you're adamant
about marrying her?

149
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:03,879
Grandma.

150
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:07,319
Please don't get those ridiculous ideas.

151
00:08:08,718 --> 00:08:12,689
Mom, Dad, Grandma, and Auntie.

152
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:16,259
You always trusted me
and have been supportive of me.

153
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:19,958
Please do so once again
and support my decision.

154
00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:25,098
I believe that you will
and head to my room.

155
00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:32,338
Hey!

156
00:08:32,978 --> 00:08:34,879
Sun Young, Hyun Chul.

157
00:08:34,908 --> 00:08:36,749
Why aren't you saying anything?

158
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,949
Are you not going to stop him?

159
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:43,919
I'm too baffled right now...

160
00:08:44,418 --> 00:08:46,859
to say anything.

161
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:50,289
Unbelievable. He has lost his mind.

162
00:08:51,158 --> 00:08:52,198
Sun Young.

163
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,198
Hyun Chul.

164
00:08:53,198 --> 00:08:57,299
What if the adoption falls through
because of the marriage?

165
00:08:57,999 --> 00:08:59,999
Chairman Gong will be welcoming...

166
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:03,269
his brother's ex-fiancee
as his daughter-in-law.

167
00:09:03,308 --> 00:09:05,409
It wouldn't be ideal at all.

168
00:09:05,609 --> 00:09:09,149
My gosh. What on earth is going on?

169
00:09:09,178 --> 00:09:11,578
How can he ruin a done deal?

170
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:14,978
In no way
will we allow this wedding.

171
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,889
No way.

172
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:18,618
It seems like...

173
00:09:18,788 --> 00:09:21,588
Pil Seung wants to marry her
because he knows she's Do Ra.

174
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:25,289
Could revealing her true identity
be the right way to go?

175
00:09:25,828 --> 00:09:28,029
Gosh. What do I do?

176
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:30,774
What were you up to?

177
00:09:30,798 --> 00:09:32,439
I was studying my script.

178
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:36,784
I can't believe we're filming
the final episode.

179
00:09:36,808 --> 00:09:38,108
It makes me nervous.

180
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,578
What about you? What were you up to?

181
00:09:40,979 --> 00:09:43,348
Something came up,
so I just got home and washed up.

182
00:09:43,948 --> 00:09:45,149
I then called you
because I was curious...

183
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:46,649
about what my baby chick was up to.

184
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:50,965
Pil Seung, can you please
not call me that?

185
00:09:50,989 --> 00:09:52,789
That's too cheesy.

186
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,658
What's so wrong about it
when you're like...

187
00:09:55,658 --> 00:09:58,689
a small, adorable, fluffy,
and pretty baby chick?

188
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,358
If I could have my way,

189
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:04,269
I'd treat you like a chick
and carry you around in my pocket.

190
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,468
I'm afraid
someone might overhear us.

191
00:10:08,739 --> 00:10:12,215
If someone did, they'd say
you're a weirdo beyond treatment.

192
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:13,639
I don't care.

193
00:10:13,808 --> 00:10:15,585
I'm calling my baby chick a chick.

194
00:10:15,609 --> 00:10:17,208
What can they do about it?

195
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:19,919
And just like a chick,

196
00:10:20,548 --> 00:10:22,748
you're small, cute, and pretty.

197
00:10:23,119 --> 00:10:24,649
Don't fight it.

198
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,458
Accept it and get used to it.

199
00:10:26,889 --> 00:10:28,258
What?

200
00:10:33,028 --> 00:10:34,328
Ji Young.

201
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:39,498
You know our marriage
won't be smooth sailing, right?

202
00:10:40,869 --> 00:10:44,338
Whatever people say,
and whatever happens,

203
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:47,478
we shall never waver.

204
00:10:48,578 --> 00:10:49,909
Remember that.

205
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:53,919
Okay.

206
00:11:11,298 --> 00:11:12,499
How are you?

207
00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:14,014
Quit the greetings and sit.

208
00:11:14,038 --> 00:11:15,868
We're not doing well.

209
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:28,549
Pil Seung says you two will marry.

210
00:11:28,918 --> 00:11:30,218
Is that true?

211
00:11:33,788 --> 00:11:35,159
Yes.

212
00:11:35,658 --> 00:11:37,789
Hey, young lady.

213
00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:41,228
How dare you say yes to our faces?

214
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:43,598
You can't be with Pil Seung.

215
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,369
And you're saying
you won't just date him...

216
00:11:46,369 --> 00:11:47,669
but marry him?

217
00:11:47,698 --> 00:11:49,514
Where's your conscience?

218
00:11:49,538 --> 00:11:52,208
Just a couple of days ago,
your engagement to Mr. Gong...

219
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,784
was in every paper.

220
00:11:53,808 --> 00:11:56,508
How could you even think
of marrying Pil Seung?

221
00:11:56,908 --> 00:11:59,054
What are you even doing?

222
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:02,488
Mother. Those articles weren't true.

223
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:05,449
Mr. Gong had them printed
without my approval.

224
00:12:05,788 --> 00:12:09,189
If the articles were true,
they'd still be online.

225
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:12,659
But you can look for yourself.
They were taken down.

226
00:12:14,328 --> 00:12:16,769
Please don't get the wrong idea
about that.

227
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:21,039
My gosh.
You're lying to our faces now.

228
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:25,208
We saw that you were
with Mr. Gong so many times.

229
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:26,939
Be quiet, Mother.

230
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:31,848
So what? Are you saying
you'll marry Pil Seung?

231
00:12:34,318 --> 00:12:35,689
Yes.

232
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:37,419
Listen!

233
00:12:37,688 --> 00:12:40,319
If you want to marry that badly,
marry Mr. Gong.

234
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,335
Why announce your engagement
with him,

235
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:45,828
then say you'll marry Pil Seung?

236
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:49,904
You're doing pretty well
as an actress now.

237
00:12:49,928 --> 00:12:51,745
So you seem to want
to bed Pil Seung...

238
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:54,498
because you're successful.

239
00:12:54,938 --> 00:12:56,809
Listen to me.

240
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:01,254
We don't like or want you
even if you're way more successful.

241
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:02,779
Not ever.

242
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:06,048
Listen, it is not
because you were orphaned...

243
00:13:06,048 --> 00:13:08,378
and grew up in the countryside.

244
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,519
We disapprove of you
because we don't like...

245
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,465
how you acted all the time
we've known you.

246
00:13:13,489 --> 00:13:15,658
So don't even dream
of marrying Pil Seung.

247
00:13:15,658 --> 00:13:16,988
Do you get that?

248
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:19,559
Sun Young. Let's go.

249
00:13:20,828 --> 00:13:22,468
My goodness.

250
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:26,039
Why did you make us say this?

251
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:28,639
Darn it.

252
00:13:48,489 --> 00:13:49,828
Mom.

253
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:51,958
Ms. Jang, you're here too.

254
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:53,728
What are you both doing here?

255
00:13:54,599 --> 00:13:57,199
Can't you tell why we're here?

256
00:13:57,469 --> 00:14:00,169
Why do you think we're both here?

257
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,008
I just talked to Ji Young,
and I don't like her even more.

258
00:14:06,438 --> 00:14:08,738
Doesn't she have a conscience?

259
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:12,524
I asked if she wanted to marry you,
and she said yes right away.

260
00:14:12,548 --> 00:14:15,154
How could she say that
so easily to my face?

261
00:14:15,178 --> 00:14:16,889
Did you see Ji Young?

262
00:14:17,849 --> 00:14:19,358
Yes, I did.

263
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:22,319
How couldn't I
when you dropped a bomb on us?

264
00:14:23,688 --> 00:14:25,328
Yes, Mr. Ko.

265
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:28,029
Anyone would say this isn't right.

266
00:14:29,428 --> 00:14:33,469
Ma Ri's uncle
still has feelings for her.

267
00:14:33,469 --> 00:14:35,598
He says it's not over between them.

268
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:38,115
How could you marry Ji Young?

269
00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:40,939
I told you so many times
that wasn't true.

270
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,549
Why do you only believe Mr. Gong?

271
00:14:45,778 --> 00:14:47,848
I don't want to say this,
but I must.

272
00:14:49,219 --> 00:14:51,048
Mr. Gong sent a coffee truck
against her will.

273
00:14:51,048 --> 00:14:52,489
He made a one-sided
engagement announcement,

274
00:14:52,489 --> 00:14:54,088
and keeps coming over to harass her.

275
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,189
Ji Young is...

276
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,659
a victim of harassment.

277
00:14:59,428 --> 00:15:02,569
If you can't defend her
or even show her compassion,

278
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:04,929
you shouldn't condemn her.

279
00:15:06,469 --> 00:15:08,299
So will you really...

280
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:10,769
marry her or something?

281
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:13,838
Yes. I told you I would.

282
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,378
You will?

283
00:15:16,979 --> 00:15:19,319
Even if we're all against it,

284
00:15:19,678 --> 00:15:21,618
you'll go all the way?

285
00:15:23,318 --> 00:15:24,889
Fine.

286
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:29,728
Marry her and live like hermits
up some mountain.

287
00:15:31,428 --> 00:15:33,128
I'll see...

288
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:36,029
how happy you are without family.

289
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:39,368
I won't go to your wedding.

290
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:42,069
I won't either.

291
00:15:42,168 --> 00:15:45,468
I don't approve of this wedding.

292
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:53,519
Mom.

293
00:15:54,249 --> 00:15:55,649
Ms. Jang.

294
00:15:56,688 --> 00:15:58,689
Can you please accept Ji Young?

295
00:15:59,589 --> 00:16:01,319
I love her.

296
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:05,365
I don't want to. I don't like her.

297
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:08,529
I just can't like her.

298
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:10,998
So, Pil Seung.

299
00:16:11,528 --> 00:16:13,669
Reconsider the decision.

300
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:19,309
I've decided to marry Ji Young,

301
00:16:19,609 --> 00:16:21,339
and I'm determined,

302
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:23,348
so don't say anything
like this again.

303
00:16:24,849 --> 00:16:28,519
I'd have treated you to a nice meal
if it hadn't been for this.

304
00:16:29,548 --> 00:16:31,248
I'm not in the mood anymore.

305
00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:33,889
You can eat without me.

306
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,059
Oh, dear.

307
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,059
My gosh.

308
00:16:39,928 --> 00:16:41,274
He's...

309
00:16:41,298 --> 00:16:42,929
He's out of his mind.

310
00:16:45,969 --> 00:16:48,368
He met the wrong girl.

311
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,968
He's not in his right mind.

312
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:54,838
What got into him?

313
00:16:55,609 --> 00:16:57,608
He wasn't like this.

314
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,348
You met my mom.

315
00:17:05,688 --> 00:17:07,218
Why didn't you tell me?

316
00:17:09,188 --> 00:17:12,128
I didn't want to bother
or worry you.

317
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:14,859
Tell me if it happens again.

318
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:16,829
Don't worry about it on your own.

319
00:17:18,129 --> 00:17:20,899
I don't want you
to suffer alone, okay?

320
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,139
Don't forget the promise we made
never to waver.

321
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:30,478
Pil Seung.

322
00:17:32,349 --> 00:17:33,679
But...

323
00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:38,449
I don't want to waver,

324
00:17:39,718 --> 00:17:41,988
but I feel like I'm wronging you.

325
00:17:44,428 --> 00:17:46,998
A marriage should be blessed,

326
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:49,258
but because of me...

327
00:17:50,998 --> 00:17:52,369
Kim Ji Young.

328
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,369
We agreed not to say that.

329
00:17:55,639 --> 00:17:57,708
I'm bothered
that I'm marrying you...

330
00:17:57,738 --> 00:18:00,879
while hiding the fact
that I'm Park Do Ra to your family.

331
00:18:01,408 --> 00:18:03,349
What would they say
if they were to know...

332
00:18:04,248 --> 00:18:05,748
who I am?

333
00:18:05,948 --> 00:18:07,649
I explained already.

334
00:18:07,918 --> 00:18:09,919
That's why we must marry.

335
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:13,718
We can't reveal
that you're Park Do Ra right now.

336
00:18:14,589 --> 00:18:16,458
We're getting married...

337
00:18:17,158 --> 00:18:18,788
so when the day comes,

338
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,528
I can be with you and protect you.

339
00:18:22,698 --> 00:18:24,429
I don't want to ever...

340
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:27,339
let you be alone again.

341
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,568
Pil Seung.

342
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:35,008
We made a promise to never waver.

343
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:37,109
Don't forget it.

344
00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:40,818
For my sake at least. Okay?

345
00:18:42,948 --> 00:18:44,288
Yes.

346
00:18:45,188 --> 00:18:46,558
Okay.

347
00:18:48,589 --> 00:18:50,389
I won't waver.

348
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:01,568
If we hadn't been here to shoot,

349
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:05,708
I'd have hugged my dear chick.

350
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:12,379
Why don't you say you want to put me
in your pocket?

351
00:19:37,639 --> 00:19:39,268
No, it's fine.

352
00:19:40,938 --> 00:19:44,508
Do Jun. I think of you all the time.

353
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:46,318
Don't you miss me?

354
00:19:46,379 --> 00:19:48,718
How could you never call me
even once?

355
00:19:53,619 --> 00:19:56,934
I told you to move out, darling.
Why won't you?

356
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,389
When will you leave?

357
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,775
I want to stay there.

358
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,599
What do you mean?

359
00:20:02,629 --> 00:20:04,629
I told you.
That family is like our enemy.

360
00:20:04,629 --> 00:20:05,799
I know that,

361
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:07,268
but you need something
you can use against them...

362
00:20:07,268 --> 00:20:08,799
to get Pil Seung's adoption
annulled.

363
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,644
Then it's better if I stay there.

364
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:11,708
Well...

365
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:13,508
Good point. You're right.

366
00:20:13,738 --> 00:20:15,839
But you said
you and Pil Seung's dad fought.

367
00:20:15,978 --> 00:20:17,478
I'll just apologize to him,
and that'll be it.

368
00:20:17,478 --> 00:20:19,278
I can certainly do that
for our son, Jin Dan.

369
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:22,018
Besides, don't you feel
more comfortable there...

370
00:20:22,018 --> 00:20:23,525
if you want to avoid Jin Dan?

371
00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:25,649
Comfortable, my foot.
I feel so uncomfortable there.

372
00:20:25,649 --> 00:20:29,258
They seemed to doubt us
when we said we were cousins.

373
00:20:29,258 --> 00:20:31,488
Even so, we'll keep saying
we're cousins.

374
00:20:31,728 --> 00:20:34,228
And if we get caught,
we'll just tell them the truth.

375
00:20:34,228 --> 00:20:36,399
You know, it's not like
we're committing a crime.

376
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,629
Well, that's true.

377
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:49,179
What's your problem?
Watch where you're going!

378
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:56,149
My gosh! No!

379
00:20:57,988 --> 00:20:59,288
You.

380
00:21:00,018 --> 00:21:02,619
I warned you
never to meet my mom again!

381
00:21:03,389 --> 00:21:06,458
I told you I'd teach you a lesson
if you met her again.

382
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,929
Jin Dan, what do you think
you're doing now?

383
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:18,708
Mom.

384
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,079
Did you just hit me?

385
00:21:22,309 --> 00:21:25,609
I told you.
You shouldn't treat him like this.

386
00:21:25,649 --> 00:21:27,295
He's my first love.

387
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,589
I told you
he'd become your stepfather.

388
00:21:30,849 --> 00:21:33,189
Mom, how could you do this to me?

389
00:21:33,488 --> 00:21:34,559
Fine.

390
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,589
Live your life however you want,
with this gigolo!

391
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:47,669
Jin Dan!

392
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,251
Thank you.

393
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,810
- We really enjoyed the food.
- Great.

394
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:53,180
Have a good day!

395
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,180
(Goban Restaurant)

396
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:12,799
Dad, do you want to meet up
for soju today?

397
00:22:25,813 --> 00:22:27,113
Pil Seung.

398
00:22:28,182 --> 00:22:31,453
I truly want to take your side,

399
00:22:31,512 --> 00:22:34,482
but I really can't support
your decision to marry her.

400
00:22:37,893 --> 00:22:39,222
Dad.

401
00:22:39,922 --> 00:22:42,522
There's a reason I must marry her.

402
00:22:43,262 --> 00:22:44,833
What is that reason?

403
00:22:46,692 --> 00:22:48,032
Dad.

404
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:50,532
Don't be surprised, okay?

405
00:22:52,303 --> 00:22:53,772
The truth is,

406
00:22:55,903 --> 00:22:57,242
Ji Young is...

407
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:00,643
Do Ra, Park Do Ra.

408
00:23:03,212 --> 00:23:07,212
Hey, what on earth
are you talking about?

409
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,059
Yes.

410
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:12,722
I know you were utterly devastated
after Do Ra died like that.

411
00:23:12,722 --> 00:23:15,168
I know all about that,

412
00:23:15,192 --> 00:23:18,793
but Kim Ji Young is Kim Ji Young.
She isn't Park Do Ra.

413
00:23:18,793 --> 00:23:21,163
Pil Seung, you need
to pull yourself together. Okay?

414
00:23:21,202 --> 00:23:23,603
Dad, I know it's hard to believe it.

415
00:23:23,603 --> 00:23:25,109
Yes, it makes no sense.

416
00:23:25,133 --> 00:23:26,802
But it's true.

417
00:23:28,343 --> 00:23:31,312
It's true Do Ra went to the beach
to take her own life.

418
00:23:31,472 --> 00:23:34,282
But she miraculously survived.

419
00:23:34,512 --> 00:23:37,113
When she washed up on the shore,
Ji Young's grandmother saved her.

420
00:23:37,113 --> 00:23:39,952
She took care of Ji Young,
thinking she was...

421
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:41,653
her missing granddaughter.

422
00:23:44,053 --> 00:23:45,793
That makes no sense.

423
00:23:45,793 --> 00:23:47,923
She looks nothing like Do Ra.

424
00:23:48,662 --> 00:23:51,192
Her face and body
were severely wounded...

425
00:23:51,192 --> 00:23:53,432
while being swept by the waves,

426
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,279
so she underwent
reconstructive surgery a few times.

427
00:23:55,303 --> 00:23:57,062
That's why she looks different now.

428
00:23:58,732 --> 00:24:01,302
What? Is that really true?

429
00:24:01,603 --> 00:24:02,903
Yes.

430
00:24:03,202 --> 00:24:05,643
She also lost her memory
due to the accident.

431
00:24:05,772 --> 00:24:09,012
Up until recently,
she had no idea she was Park Do Ra.

432
00:24:09,412 --> 00:24:10,653
She really thought she was...

433
00:24:10,653 --> 00:24:12,383
Ms. Soon Jung's granddaughter,
Kim Ji Young.

434
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:14,123
That's why she became an actress.

435
00:24:15,383 --> 00:24:18,492
But she regained her memories
a little while ago...

436
00:24:18,522 --> 00:24:20,552
and realized
she was actually Park Do Ra.

437
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:26,262
How could something like that
happen?

438
00:24:31,533 --> 00:24:32,903
Dad.

439
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:36,242
I finally met Do Ra again.

440
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:40,113
You know...

441
00:24:41,113 --> 00:24:42,913
how devastated I was...

442
00:24:43,343 --> 00:24:45,353
after Do Ra died.

443
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:48,522
Back then,

444
00:24:48,783 --> 00:24:51,093
I thought I'd die without regrets...

445
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:53,093
if I could see Do Ra even just once.

446
00:24:54,522 --> 00:24:56,163
But Do Ra is back, alive.

447
00:24:56,692 --> 00:24:58,633
I cannot break up with Do Ra.

448
00:24:58,633 --> 00:25:00,492
I'll never let her hand go.

449
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:04,732
In the darkest hour of her life,

450
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:07,173
I couldn't protect her,

451
00:25:08,772 --> 00:25:10,772
so I want to protect her now.

452
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,813
When people find out
that Ji Young is Do Ra,

453
00:25:15,813 --> 00:25:17,453
they'll hurl abuse at her.

454
00:25:18,982 --> 00:25:20,453
I want to stay by her side...

455
00:25:21,123 --> 00:25:22,782
and protect her when that happens.

456
00:25:23,383 --> 00:25:25,193
I don't want Do Ra...

457
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:27,962
to go through everything
all by herself again.

458
00:25:42,603 --> 00:25:44,042
All right.

459
00:25:44,672 --> 00:25:46,242
Pil Seung.

460
00:25:48,412 --> 00:25:52,052
I understand
what you're trying to say.

461
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:57,183
I'd feel the same way.

462
00:25:57,492 --> 00:25:59,252
Your thoughts and your situation.

463
00:25:59,952 --> 00:26:02,292
I totally get it, all right?

464
00:26:05,692 --> 00:26:09,863
But as for this marriage,
the family's approval is important.

465
00:26:10,732 --> 00:26:14,302
However, I think
Chairman Gong should know too.

466
00:26:15,202 --> 00:26:18,572
You've made up your mind to become
Chairman Gong's adopted son.

467
00:26:18,742 --> 00:26:21,942
But when and if the whole world
finds out that Kim Ji Young,

468
00:26:21,942 --> 00:26:25,183
the woman you're marrying,
is actually Park Do Ra,

469
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:27,283
Chairman Gong
will be utterly baffled.

470
00:26:27,283 --> 00:26:29,198
And because of you,

471
00:26:29,222 --> 00:26:32,822
APP Group could suffer damage too.

472
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:39,292
I understand what
you're trying to tell me.

473
00:26:40,762 --> 00:26:43,133
All right. Well...

474
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:46,772
Who else knows
that Kim Ji Young is Park Do Ra?

475
00:26:48,472 --> 00:26:51,388
Me, Do Ra's family, and you.

476
00:26:51,412 --> 00:26:53,712
But I'm the only one who knows
that she's regained her memories.

477
00:26:54,543 --> 00:26:57,913
So, she decided to live as Ji Young
until she clears her name.

478
00:26:58,613 --> 00:27:00,252
I see. You see, this...

479
00:27:00,883 --> 00:27:02,623
We should keep this a secret, okay?

480
00:27:02,623 --> 00:27:05,623
For the time being,
we won't tell anyone,

481
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:07,822
including your mom, grandma,
and even Myung Dong.

482
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:13,032
Once she clears her name,

483
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:14,962
and when the time is right,

484
00:27:16,432 --> 00:27:18,502
then we'll tell everyone.

485
00:27:19,172 --> 00:27:20,572
Okay, Dad.

486
00:27:22,143 --> 00:27:23,802
Dad, I ask you...

487
00:27:24,412 --> 00:27:26,173
to please support us
and our decision.

488
00:27:30,653 --> 00:27:31,953
All right.

489
00:27:34,422 --> 00:27:35,722
Thanks.

490
00:27:59,058 --> 00:28:03,339
(Chairman Gong Jin Taek)

491
00:28:16,823 --> 00:28:19,062
What you told me just now.

492
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:21,833
Is it all true?

493
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:25,302
Yes.

494
00:28:31,472 --> 00:28:32,913
My goodness.

495
00:28:34,143 --> 00:28:35,782
How could something like that
happen?

496
00:28:39,212 --> 00:28:40,982
Personally,

497
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:44,069
I hope Ji Young can continue
to live as Kim Ji Young...

498
00:28:44,093 --> 00:28:46,693
without anyone
ever finding the truth,

499
00:28:47,522 --> 00:28:50,163
but if people do find out
that she's actually Park Do Ra,

500
00:28:50,863 --> 00:28:54,732
it might negatively impact APP Group
and you as well.

501
00:28:55,462 --> 00:28:57,802
That's why I wanted to tell you
in advance.

502
00:28:58,502 --> 00:29:01,673
Your parents aren't supportive...

503
00:29:01,942 --> 00:29:03,903
and neither is my wife.

504
00:29:04,613 --> 00:29:06,712
And for many reasons,

505
00:29:07,073 --> 00:29:10,042
I wasn't really in favor of you
marrying her.

506
00:29:10,952 --> 00:29:13,052
But after hearing from you today,

507
00:29:13,853 --> 00:29:18,052
it is clear to me
that this marriage can't happen.

508
00:29:18,793 --> 00:29:22,123
Especially for Ma Ri,

509
00:29:22,722 --> 00:29:24,833
I wanted to adopt you...

510
00:29:25,162 --> 00:29:27,462
despite the risks it might entail.

511
00:29:29,432 --> 00:29:32,232
But this is something
I can't accept.

512
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:35,103
I'm also concerned...

513
00:29:35,202 --> 00:29:37,542
about her gambling addict
of a mother.

514
00:29:37,972 --> 00:29:40,113
If I adopt you,

515
00:29:41,182 --> 00:29:43,512
Kim Ji Young will become
my daughter-in-law.

516
00:29:45,412 --> 00:29:47,252
I can't approve of that.

517
00:29:49,783 --> 00:29:52,552
What if the world
eventually finds out...

518
00:29:53,353 --> 00:29:54,962
that she is Park Do Ra?

519
00:29:56,563 --> 00:29:58,792
The scandal will hurt you as well.

520
00:30:00,093 --> 00:30:01,663
Even if she is innocent...

521
00:30:02,262 --> 00:30:04,472
regarding the sponsor scandal,

522
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:06,433
how can the public possibly accept...

523
00:30:07,103 --> 00:30:11,173
the fact that she got into acting again
as Kim Ji Young?

524
00:30:12,772 --> 00:30:15,183
Everyone will throw stones at her.

525
00:30:16,712 --> 00:30:18,883
And you'll get affected
in the process as well.

526
00:30:21,752 --> 00:30:23,252
I believe...

527
00:30:25,093 --> 00:30:28,863
you should end it with her
while you still can.

528
00:30:36,533 --> 00:30:37,903
Chairman Gong,

529
00:30:39,932 --> 00:30:41,302
I wasn't able...

530
00:30:41,942 --> 00:30:44,203
to protect her when she was Do Ra.

531
00:30:46,613 --> 00:30:48,583
So when I learned she had come back,

532
00:30:49,712 --> 00:30:51,353
I promised myself...

533
00:30:52,252 --> 00:30:54,312
not to let go of her hand again.

534
00:30:56,482 --> 00:30:58,292
If this is going to be a problem,

535
00:30:59,293 --> 00:31:02,363
you can withdraw
the decision to adopt me.

536
00:31:03,692 --> 00:31:05,363
I never want...

537
00:31:05,692 --> 00:31:08,062
to cause you any grief,

538
00:31:08,762 --> 00:31:10,532
which is why I told you in advance.

539
00:31:16,903 --> 00:31:18,373
Then,

540
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:21,443
are you saying...

541
00:31:22,883 --> 00:31:24,553
you'd give up on the adoption...

542
00:31:24,553 --> 00:31:26,913
rather than letting her go?

543
00:31:29,752 --> 00:31:31,953
Yes, that's right.

544
00:31:37,222 --> 00:31:40,532
I guess that leaves me
with no choice.

545
00:31:41,932 --> 00:31:46,173
I'm truly fond of you
and trust you dearly,

546
00:31:46,472 --> 00:31:49,603
which is why I wanted you as my son.

547
00:31:51,772 --> 00:31:55,482
However, I'm the man responsible
for the thousands of my employees...

548
00:31:56,182 --> 00:31:59,353
as well as their families.

549
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:03,653
If you become my son,

550
00:32:05,093 --> 00:32:08,022
your wife will be the face
of the company,

551
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:11,193
and I can't afford a risk
of this magnitude.

552
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:13,732
I'm against...

553
00:32:14,803 --> 00:32:19,272
having a woman like her
as my daughter-in-law.

554
00:32:21,242 --> 00:32:24,143
Even if you don't become my adopted son,

555
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:27,883
it's better for you...

556
00:32:28,242 --> 00:32:30,242
to steer clear of her too.

557
00:32:34,012 --> 00:32:35,482
I will pretend...

558
00:32:37,283 --> 00:32:39,022
this conversation never happened.

559
00:32:43,222 --> 00:32:44,633
You can leave now.

560
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:49,232
I apologize, Chairman Gong.

561
00:33:33,942 --> 00:33:35,242
All right.

562
00:33:35,383 --> 00:33:37,083
What's this important news
you have to share?

563
00:33:38,853 --> 00:33:41,453
Well, I've regained...

564
00:33:43,853 --> 00:33:45,423
my memories.

565
00:33:48,922 --> 00:33:51,363
Do Sik, isn't it nice to see me?

566
00:33:51,692 --> 00:33:54,438
Sure. What a pleasure this is.

567
00:33:54,462 --> 00:33:56,933
Was it fun keeping me in the dark?

568
00:33:57,063 --> 00:33:59,432
Hold on. What's with that response?

569
00:33:59,432 --> 00:34:01,448
Do Ra, he already knows.

570
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:03,379
He figured it out, so I told him.

571
00:34:03,403 --> 00:34:04,442
- Really?
- Yes.

572
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:06,218
Why didn't you tell me?

573
00:34:06,242 --> 00:34:07,512
It seemed like
you weren't telling me...

574
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:08,918
because of Mom.

575
00:34:08,942 --> 00:34:11,089
You have to live as Ji Young anyway,

576
00:34:11,113 --> 00:34:12,683
so it seemed pointless.

577
00:34:13,653 --> 00:34:15,252
I'm sorry, Do Sik.

578
00:34:15,623 --> 00:34:17,882
Since you lived with Mom,

579
00:34:18,053 --> 00:34:20,268
I didn't want you to tell her
by accident.

580
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:21,793
I know that.

581
00:34:22,622 --> 00:34:24,963
Was that the important news
you had to share?

582
00:34:25,392 --> 00:34:28,233
No, there's more.

583
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:29,538
Which is?

584
00:34:29,562 --> 00:34:31,632
What is it? Out with it already.

585
00:34:33,502 --> 00:34:34,873
I'm...

586
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,043
getting married.

587
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:39,743
- You're getting married?
- What?

588
00:34:39,743 --> 00:34:41,382
- To whom?
- But that's so sudden!

589
00:34:42,383 --> 00:34:43,913
To Pil Seung.

590
00:34:44,953 --> 00:34:46,828
After regaining my memories,

591
00:34:46,852 --> 00:34:49,583
I realized that he's the only one
I ever loved.

592
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:53,322
I've only had eyes for him,

593
00:34:53,553 --> 00:34:57,023
but Mom made me believe
that I had feelings for Mr. Gong.

594
00:34:59,033 --> 00:35:00,393
I see.

595
00:35:00,663 --> 00:35:02,963
I guess
I got the wrong idea as well.

596
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:07,532
Does Pil Seung know
that you remember everything?

597
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:09,172
Yes.

598
00:35:10,403 --> 00:35:13,012
Talk about fate.

599
00:35:13,372 --> 00:35:15,482
You liked him as Do Ra...

600
00:35:15,482 --> 00:35:17,213
and then as Ji Young.

601
00:35:18,113 --> 00:35:20,652
Does his family know
that you're Do Ra as well?

602
00:35:21,582 --> 00:35:22,953
No.

603
00:35:23,153 --> 00:35:27,922
Only Pil Seung and you two know
that I'm Do Ra.

604
00:35:29,823 --> 00:35:33,733
Of course, you have to live
as Ji Young anyway.

605
00:35:38,872 --> 00:35:42,449
Is it okay for me
to get married, then?

606
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,003
Yes, of course.

607
00:35:45,942 --> 00:35:48,782
Pil Seung made a tough decision.

608
00:35:48,982 --> 00:35:50,482
It won't be easy for him...

609
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,228
once it's out that you're Do Ra.

610
00:35:52,252 --> 00:35:53,583
I know.

611
00:35:53,712 --> 00:35:56,529
He's a true man.

612
00:35:56,553 --> 00:35:57,922
It's admirable.

613
00:35:59,352 --> 00:36:00,722
Also,

614
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,123
I'm truly grateful.

615
00:36:06,692 --> 00:36:08,032
Goodness.

616
00:36:14,473 --> 00:36:16,043
You never know.

617
00:36:16,803 --> 00:36:18,342
Check this out.

618
00:36:22,683 --> 00:36:24,583
What kind of an ensemble is that?

619
00:36:26,183 --> 00:36:29,023
Why is Ji Young
linking arms with Mr. Park...

620
00:36:29,852 --> 00:36:31,453
when he's not Ko Pil Seung?

621
00:36:33,153 --> 00:36:35,992
Ji Young may have lived
with Ms. Baek, but...

622
00:36:36,962 --> 00:36:39,393
And it's Mr. Park
who is caring for her grandmother.

623
00:36:40,763 --> 00:36:42,362
What am I seeing?

624
00:36:42,832 --> 00:36:44,603
On top of that,
Ms. Baek isn't even around.

625
00:36:48,942 --> 00:36:50,473
- It was 60 cents.
- No, it was 50 cents.

626
00:36:50,473 --> 00:36:51,989
You think it was 20 cents?

627
00:36:52,013 --> 00:36:53,042
- Twenty cents?
- Twenty cents?

628
00:36:53,042 --> 00:36:55,042
- What year are you referring to?
- What?

629
00:36:55,042 --> 00:36:57,759
It's true. It was that cheap.

630
00:36:57,783 --> 00:36:59,152
As if.

631
00:37:02,283 --> 00:37:04,253
Ms. Baek isn't around,

632
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:07,753
so why are her two sons
entering Ji Young's house?

633
00:37:08,663 --> 00:37:10,793
Ji Young lives there
with her grandmother.

634
00:37:12,192 --> 00:37:13,592
Hold on.

635
00:37:14,433 --> 00:37:16,503
Is there something going on...

636
00:37:16,633 --> 00:37:18,172
between Ji Young
and Ms. Baek's two sons?

637
00:37:20,732 --> 00:37:22,103
Something's not right.

638
00:37:23,142 --> 00:37:26,742
There's something fishy
about all this.

639
00:37:28,452 --> 00:37:29,998
Seriously.

640
00:37:30,404 --> 00:37:31,534
What could you possibly want...

641
00:37:31,534 --> 00:37:33,680
that you came to see me
at this hour?

642
00:37:33,704 --> 00:37:35,404
You know what? Right now,

643
00:37:35,404 --> 00:37:38,404
I'm not feeling well,
so say what you want and leave...

644
00:37:38,404 --> 00:37:40,113
unless you're here to give me money.

645
00:37:40,773 --> 00:37:43,144
There's something I wanted to ask.

646
00:37:43,913 --> 00:37:46,090
How come you're living here...

647
00:37:46,114 --> 00:37:49,553
while your two sons
live with Kim Ji Young?

648
00:37:51,284 --> 00:37:52,800
What's it to you?

649
00:37:52,824 --> 00:37:56,053
Why should I even answer that?
Is that what you came here to ask?

650
00:37:58,724 --> 00:38:00,093
Well,

651
00:38:01,534 --> 00:38:04,263
that's one of the things
I wanted to ask.

652
00:38:06,603 --> 00:38:09,504
I'm really upset with you
to say the least.

653
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:12,803
How could you treat me like this
after everything I did for you?

654
00:38:13,844 --> 00:38:15,389
What do you mean?

655
00:38:15,413 --> 00:38:18,184
How could you let Ji Young
marry Pil Seung?

656
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:19,914
Is that why you paid the money back?

657
00:38:20,483 --> 00:38:22,213
When I lent you the 500,000 dollars,

658
00:38:22,213 --> 00:38:24,229
you agreed to send Ji Young my way.

659
00:38:24,253 --> 00:38:25,923
So how could you do this to me?

660
00:38:26,994 --> 00:38:30,163
I won't brag
about lending you that money,

661
00:38:30,163 --> 00:38:32,764
so stop this marriage
no matter what.

662
00:38:32,764 --> 00:38:34,064
Got it?

663
00:38:34,134 --> 00:38:35,934
Or you'll pay.

664
00:38:36,434 --> 00:38:37,734
Wait.

665
00:38:38,163 --> 00:38:39,533
Hold on.

666
00:38:39,934 --> 00:38:43,033
Who's marrying whom?

667
00:38:43,974 --> 00:38:45,274
Ms. Baek.

668
00:38:45,543 --> 00:38:47,474
Aren't you the head
of Kim Ji Young's agency?

669
00:38:47,674 --> 00:38:49,113
How could you not know this?

670
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:51,743
Ji Young will soon marry
Ko Pil Seung.

671
00:38:54,284 --> 00:38:55,814
What the...

672
00:38:56,353 --> 00:38:57,724
Is that true?

673
00:38:58,853 --> 00:39:00,153
Kim Ji Young.

674
00:39:00,454 --> 00:39:01,800
Open up!

675
00:39:01,824 --> 00:39:03,993
Kim Ji Young, open up!

676
00:39:04,893 --> 00:39:07,564
You! Open up.

677
00:39:08,193 --> 00:39:09,963
Kim Ji Young!

678
00:39:10,963 --> 00:39:12,204
You've got to be kidding me.

679
00:39:12,204 --> 00:39:13,533
Open this door right now.

680
00:39:15,174 --> 00:39:16,673
Mom, what...

681
00:39:17,304 --> 00:39:19,043
How dare you come here?
What do you want?

682
00:39:19,043 --> 00:39:20,544
Move, you brat.

683
00:39:20,744 --> 00:39:22,044
Kim Ji Young.

684
00:39:22,713 --> 00:39:25,244
I heard
you were marrying Ko Pil Seung.

685
00:39:25,244 --> 00:39:26,389
Is this true?

686
00:39:26,413 --> 00:39:27,983
Please tell me it's not.

687
00:39:27,983 --> 00:39:30,484
Yes, it's true.

688
00:39:30,554 --> 00:39:32,584
I'm marrying Director Ko.

689
00:39:32,963 --> 00:39:35,485
You're insane.
You've lost your mind.

690
00:39:35,509 --> 00:39:37,949
You just managed
to get a footing as an actress...

691
00:39:37,949 --> 00:39:39,849
and are finally
on your way to stardom,

692
00:39:39,849 --> 00:39:41,489
so how dare you consider marriage?

693
00:39:41,489 --> 00:39:43,789
Who says you can marry?

694
00:39:43,858 --> 00:39:44,858
What?

695
00:39:44,858 --> 00:39:47,188
Also, why does it have to be
with Ko Pil Seung?

696
00:39:47,188 --> 00:39:49,135
How could it be with Ko Pil Seung?

697
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:52,969
Ji Young, no. You can't marry him.

698
00:39:52,969 --> 00:39:54,469
I already told you...

699
00:39:54,469 --> 00:39:58,169
that he's like our mortal enemy.

700
00:39:58,268 --> 00:40:00,368
Ko Pil Seung, that punk,

701
00:40:00,469 --> 00:40:02,568
is the one
who drove you to your death!

702
00:40:02,568 --> 00:40:05,408
Enough with the darn lies!

703
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:11,278
You're the one
who drove me to my death, Mom.

704
00:40:11,779 --> 00:40:14,749
It was you. It was your fault, Mom!

705
00:40:14,989 --> 00:40:16,695
So why are you saying
it was Pil Seung?

706
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:18,818
How could you say it was Pil Seung?

707
00:40:26,429 --> 00:40:27,868
Ji Young, you...

708
00:40:29,869 --> 00:40:32,769
You must remember everything.

709
00:40:33,708 --> 00:40:35,368
Right?

710
00:40:36,009 --> 00:40:37,408
My gosh.

711
00:40:38,409 --> 00:40:40,008
Park Do Sik.

712
00:40:40,849 --> 00:40:43,008
And you, Do Jun. Did you all know?

713
00:40:43,518 --> 00:40:44,818
Unbelievable.

714
00:40:44,849 --> 00:40:46,195
How...

715
00:40:46,219 --> 00:40:49,548
How can you do this
to your own mother?

716
00:40:49,818 --> 00:40:52,419
That's right. I remember now.

717
00:40:52,489 --> 00:40:54,089
I remember everything.

718
00:40:54,889 --> 00:40:56,829
You abandoned me
at a vacation home...

719
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:59,559
as a way to pawn me off to Mr. Gong.

720
00:41:00,029 --> 00:41:01,529
You made me pose nude...

721
00:41:01,529 --> 00:41:04,345
to earn money
to pay off your debt to loan sharks.

722
00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:07,414
I went to a hotel
for the ad campaign you had booked.

723
00:41:07,438 --> 00:41:10,115
That led to the sponsor scandal
which made me take my own life!

724
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:12,509
No. That's not true, Ji Young.

725
00:41:12,509 --> 00:41:13,779
That's...

726
00:41:13,779 --> 00:41:15,548
Do you know what you did to me...

727
00:41:15,909 --> 00:41:19,178
when I was Do Ra
and also when I was Ji Young?

728
00:41:19,818 --> 00:41:22,289
All you ever talked about was money.

729
00:41:22,759 --> 00:41:24,718
That's all you wanted from me.

730
00:41:25,259 --> 00:41:27,728
And everything you said was a lie.

731
00:41:27,728 --> 00:41:29,528
All you did was lie!

732
00:41:30,128 --> 00:41:31,729
Because of you,

733
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:34,168
I hated Pil Seung,

734
00:41:34,168 --> 00:41:36,539
resented him, and hurt him.

735
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:39,708
You're the reason
I took my own life,

736
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:43,479
so how could you blame him
for everything you did?

737
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:45,638
But even after all that,

738
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:49,149
you're still trying to deceive me.

739
00:41:50,148 --> 00:41:53,188
How can you even call yourself
my mother?

740
00:41:53,188 --> 00:41:54,548
Mom!

741
00:41:56,559 --> 00:41:58,988
Did you really abandon her
at the vacation home?

742
00:41:59,588 --> 00:42:02,128
Is everything she said true?

743
00:42:02,128 --> 00:42:03,759
Do Jun, of course not!

744
00:42:03,759 --> 00:42:05,559
Let me explain everything.

745
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:06,668
Darn it!

746
00:42:06,668 --> 00:42:09,369
Mom, you have to go. Just leave!

747
00:42:09,369 --> 00:42:11,738
Hold on, you brat!

748
00:42:12,099 --> 00:42:14,739
Do Ra, Do Jun, and Do Sik.

749
00:42:14,739 --> 00:42:16,509
It's true...

750
00:42:16,509 --> 00:42:18,639
that the money I owed to loan sharks
made Do Ra's life harder.

751
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:20,678
But that's not all.

752
00:42:20,708 --> 00:42:22,608
Mr. Gong is a decent man.

753
00:42:22,608 --> 00:42:25,318
I pushed her toward him
because he is decent.

754
00:42:25,318 --> 00:42:26,689
Mom.

755
00:42:27,018 --> 00:42:29,749
Do you even know what he did to me?

756
00:42:30,289 --> 00:42:33,189
And you're still saying
he's a decent man.

757
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:36,199
Is anyone who's rich
decent in your eyes?

758
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:37,729
Is money all you care about?

759
00:42:38,329 --> 00:42:39,698
Is that why...

760
00:42:40,369 --> 00:42:43,568
you told me we were in love?

761
00:42:43,568 --> 00:42:46,609
You told me that
when I didn't remember my past.

762
00:42:47,139 --> 00:42:49,878
- No...
- You witch!

763
00:42:49,878 --> 00:42:50,938
You!

764
00:42:50,938 --> 00:42:52,378
My goodness.

765
00:42:52,378 --> 00:42:54,148
- You!
- No, don't.

766
00:42:54,148 --> 00:42:56,219
- What's this?
- Grandma, please.

767
00:42:56,219 --> 00:42:57,679
Mom, please go. Get out of here.

768
00:42:57,679 --> 00:42:59,179
- What is all this?
- Get out!

769
00:42:59,179 --> 00:43:03,035
What is the matter with her?
My gosh!

770
00:43:03,059 --> 00:43:04,489
Goodness.

771
00:43:04,489 --> 00:43:09,089
My poor Ji Young...

772
00:43:10,759 --> 00:43:12,559
My goodness.

773
00:43:37,858 --> 00:43:40,728
Those brats!

774
00:43:40,728 --> 00:43:43,598
As a single mother at a young age,

775
00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:47,329
I raised them the best I could...

776
00:43:47,369 --> 00:43:49,698
by skipping my own meals...

777
00:43:50,469 --> 00:43:53,509
and not buying anything for myself.

778
00:43:53,509 --> 00:43:56,468
So how could those brats
do this to me?

779
00:43:58,378 --> 00:44:02,408
I'm your mother, darn it!

780
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:06,588
How could you treat me this way?

781
00:44:06,588 --> 00:44:09,389
How could you do this to me?

782
00:44:09,389 --> 00:44:13,059
You darn brats. How could you?

783
00:44:17,259 --> 00:44:21,298
How could you do this to me,
you brats?

784
00:44:22,998 --> 00:44:25,138
Jin Dan!

785
00:44:25,938 --> 00:44:28,309
What now? What is it?

786
00:44:28,809 --> 00:44:32,439
Kim Ji Young is meeting
with Ko Pil Seung's family.

787
00:44:33,809 --> 00:44:36,108
What? A family gathering?

788
00:44:36,108 --> 00:44:37,119
That's right.

789
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,164
I can't thank Pil Seung enough
for deciding to marry her.

790
00:44:40,188 --> 00:44:43,159
Once they marry,
you'll automatically move on.

791
00:44:43,159 --> 00:44:46,559
I feel liberated as if an aching tooth
has been pulled out.

792
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:49,188
Jin Dan, if the news is too unsettling,

793
00:44:49,188 --> 00:44:51,474
go abroad and get some fresh air
for a few months.

794
00:44:51,498 --> 00:44:54,729
Go on a trip to forget
about that country bumpkin. Okay?

795
00:44:57,139 --> 00:44:58,769
This is great.

796
00:45:04,478 --> 00:45:06,109
A family gathering?

797
00:45:06,779 --> 00:45:09,749
What should I do about them?

798
00:45:17,259 --> 00:45:18,559
What?

799
00:45:18,989 --> 00:45:20,428
Who can it be?

800
00:45:24,498 --> 00:45:25,999
Who is it?

801
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:28,968
Ji Young.

802
00:45:30,739 --> 00:45:33,368
Your mom's here.

803
00:45:34,608 --> 00:45:35,908
My gosh.

804
00:45:36,268 --> 00:45:39,748
Ji Young, you look beautiful today.

805
00:45:39,748 --> 00:45:41,508
Oh, that's right.

806
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:43,348
You're meeting that guy's family.

807
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:46,219
Take me with you.

808
00:45:46,219 --> 00:45:47,789
It's not like you don't have a mom,

809
00:45:47,789 --> 00:45:50,465
so I should come with you.

810
00:45:50,489 --> 00:45:53,658
What are you doing here
drunk out of your mind?

811
00:45:54,059 --> 00:45:55,928
You promised
you'd never come back here.

812
00:45:55,958 --> 00:45:58,099
Yes, I know that.

813
00:45:58,099 --> 00:45:59,859
But I got thinking.

814
00:46:01,699 --> 00:46:03,899
I wanted to do right by you,

815
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,438
but since I lacked in many ways,

816
00:46:05,438 --> 00:46:08,068
I made life miserable
for you instead.

817
00:46:08,969 --> 00:46:10,309
However,

818
00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:13,979
you can't say
that all I did was hurt you.

819
00:46:15,349 --> 00:46:17,779
I only did one thing wrong,

820
00:46:17,779 --> 00:46:19,919
and that was getting hooked
on gambling.

821
00:46:20,748 --> 00:46:22,218
That's all.

822
00:46:23,418 --> 00:46:26,119
I'm done with that now.

823
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:29,529
Someone could stick...

824
00:46:29,529 --> 00:46:31,958
a card on my cheek,

825
00:46:31,958 --> 00:46:34,568
but I still wouldn't play the game.

826
00:46:37,969 --> 00:46:39,568
Please, Do Ra.

827
00:46:42,409 --> 00:46:45,809
Can't you take me back as your mom?

828
00:46:45,809 --> 00:46:50,278
I'll do right by you from now on.

829
00:46:51,018 --> 00:46:54,289
Besides, why would you
get married this fast?

830
00:46:54,289 --> 00:46:56,119
You're a rising star,

831
00:46:56,119 --> 00:46:58,664
so have the wedding
after you earn some money.

832
00:46:58,688 --> 00:47:01,628
The money you'll earn
after getting married.

833
00:47:01,628 --> 00:47:04,429
Will it go
into Ko Pil Seung's pocket?

834
00:47:04,429 --> 00:47:06,898
Hey, I'm the one who raised you,

835
00:47:06,898 --> 00:47:09,699
so why should he get all that money?

836
00:47:09,699 --> 00:47:11,138
Ms. Baek.

837
00:47:13,409 --> 00:47:15,669
I don't want to talk about this
with you.

838
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:18,539
So please, just leave.

839
00:47:18,909 --> 00:47:21,249
"Ms. Baek?"

840
00:47:22,449 --> 00:47:24,948
I'm your mom, darn it!

841
00:47:25,818 --> 00:47:27,118
You...

842
00:47:27,619 --> 00:47:30,465
Did you suddenly pop out of nowhere?

843
00:47:30,489 --> 00:47:33,228
I gave birth to you and raised you.

844
00:47:33,228 --> 00:47:34,458
But what?

845
00:47:34,458 --> 00:47:36,388
I'm Kim Ji Young.

846
00:47:39,259 --> 00:47:41,405
But you remember everything.

847
00:47:41,429 --> 00:47:43,068
Park Do Ra!

848
00:47:43,869 --> 00:47:46,909
You'll always be my daughter,
and I'll always be your mother.

849
00:47:46,909 --> 00:47:49,515
It is your duty to take care of me.

850
00:47:49,539 --> 00:47:53,008
If you want to get married,
get me a million dollars first.

851
00:47:53,139 --> 00:47:54,425
You...

852
00:47:54,449 --> 00:47:57,118
What am I supposed to do
once you get married?

853
00:47:57,179 --> 00:48:00,149
How am I supposed to live then?

854
00:48:00,449 --> 00:48:01,888
Will you...

855
00:48:02,949 --> 00:48:05,658
Will you please...

856
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:09,459
Will you stop this already?

857
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:13,258
Why should I give you
a million dollars?

858
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:16,499
Am I in your debt?

859
00:48:16,668 --> 00:48:20,468
Why are you clinging to me
like a darn leech?

860
00:48:22,869 --> 00:48:24,278
A leech?

861
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:28,178
My gosh. Listen to this brat.

862
00:48:28,949 --> 00:48:31,278
What did you call me? A leech?

863
00:48:31,349 --> 00:48:34,388
You witch!
Why should you give me money?

864
00:48:34,588 --> 00:48:36,619
I went through so much torment
to raise you.

865
00:48:36,619 --> 00:48:38,465
How dare you try to ditch me now?

866
00:48:38,489 --> 00:48:41,188
If you keep this up,
I'll tell the whole world.

867
00:48:41,188 --> 00:48:43,598
I'll tell everyone
you're Park Do Ra!

868
00:48:43,659 --> 00:48:45,059
You witch.

869
00:48:45,159 --> 00:48:46,945
How could you do this to me?

870
00:48:46,969 --> 00:48:49,168
How could you do this to me?

871
00:48:49,168 --> 00:48:50,644
- How could you?
- Mom!

872
00:48:50,668 --> 00:48:52,369
You can't do this to me.

873
00:48:52,369 --> 00:48:55,108
- What are you doing? Let go of her!
- How could you...

874
00:48:55,108 --> 00:48:57,515
How could you do this to me?

875
00:48:57,539 --> 00:48:59,584
- How could you?
- You witch!

876
00:48:59,608 --> 00:49:02,124
You evil thing!

877
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:05,854
How dare you pull my Ji Young's hair?

878
00:49:05,878 --> 00:49:08,618
- You nasty thing.
- Let go.

879
00:49:09,219 --> 00:49:11,188
Come outside. We're leaving!

880
00:49:11,188 --> 00:49:12,865
- What, you fool?
- Mom.

881
00:49:12,889 --> 00:49:16,129
- What, you fool?
- Let's go.

882
00:49:17,059 --> 00:49:18,999
- My gosh.
- How could she?

883
00:49:20,228 --> 00:49:25,068
What should we do about your hair?

884
00:49:25,239 --> 00:49:29,215
You're supposed to meet
your fiance's family.

885
00:49:29,239 --> 00:49:32,778
What are we going to do
about that witch?

886
00:49:33,478 --> 00:49:36,408
Poor Ji Young...

887
00:49:37,779 --> 00:49:39,178
Oh, dear.

888
00:49:41,219 --> 00:49:42,618
Come with me!

889
00:49:44,188 --> 00:49:46,829
Let's just die together, Mom.

890
00:49:46,829 --> 00:49:48,458
Do Jun and Do Ra
can't live like this.

891
00:49:48,458 --> 00:49:50,128
You'll be the death of them both.
Let's go!

892
00:49:50,128 --> 00:49:53,075
Let go of me, you darn punk.

893
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:55,544
You always talked about
jumping into the Han River.

894
00:49:55,568 --> 00:49:57,974
Come with me. I'll grant your wish!

895
00:49:57,998 --> 00:50:00,309
Let go of me, you evil thing.

896
00:50:00,338 --> 00:50:02,615
You wouldn't have been born
if it weren't for me.

897
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:05,338
And this is how you
and that brat act?

898
00:50:05,338 --> 00:50:07,409
As soon as she regained her memory,

899
00:50:07,409 --> 00:50:09,878
she should've told me
and treated me well.

900
00:50:09,878 --> 00:50:12,394
How could she act clueless?

901
00:50:12,418 --> 00:50:15,325
How could the three of you
leave me in the dark?

902
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:17,719
Fine. Do whatever you want.

903
00:50:17,719 --> 00:50:18,989
If that's how it's going to be,

904
00:50:18,989 --> 00:50:21,934
I'll tell the whole world
that she's Do Ra.

905
00:50:21,958 --> 00:50:25,729
- Kim Ji Young is Park Do Ra!
- Are you crazy? Be quiet.

906
00:50:26,498 --> 00:50:28,068
Come with me!

907
00:50:28,469 --> 00:50:30,298
Let go of me.

908
00:50:30,438 --> 00:50:32,244
I'll go home on my own.

909
00:50:32,268 --> 00:50:34,615
Don't you follow me.

910
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:36,568
Move! Out of my way.

911
00:50:38,938 --> 00:50:40,309
Darn it!

912
00:50:56,798 --> 00:50:58,499
What did I just hear?

913
00:50:59,759 --> 00:51:01,298
Kim Ji Young...

914
00:51:01,829 --> 00:51:03,198
is Park Do Ra?

915
00:51:05,298 --> 00:51:06,798
That Park Do Ra?

916
00:51:09,239 --> 00:51:11,938
Am I not allowed to talk the way
you speak to me?

917
00:51:11,938 --> 00:51:13,454
Gong Jin Dan!

918
00:51:13,478 --> 00:51:16,024
Stop this
before I turn really nasty.

919
00:51:16,048 --> 00:51:20,048
- Kim Ji Young is Park Do Ra!
- Are you crazy? Be quiet.

920
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:22,189
Come with me!

921
00:51:34,268 --> 00:51:36,129
The darn punk.

922
00:51:37,068 --> 00:51:38,439
Oh, goodness.

923
00:51:38,739 --> 00:51:40,868
Why are there no taxis?

924
00:51:42,068 --> 00:51:43,709
- Ms. Baek.
- My goodness.

925
00:51:44,409 --> 00:51:47,548
Is Kim Ji Young Park Do Ra?

926
00:51:48,349 --> 00:51:50,649
What are you talking about?

927
00:51:53,378 --> 00:51:55,388
I thought it was weird.

928
00:51:56,048 --> 00:51:59,589
Kim Ji Young had the mind
of Park Do Ra.

929
00:52:00,259 --> 00:52:01,629
Didn't she?

930
00:52:02,588 --> 00:52:06,305
No. Who said Ji Young is Do Ra?

931
00:52:06,329 --> 00:52:09,098
I don't know
where you heard what you did.

932
00:52:09,728 --> 00:52:11,638
I heard everything just now...

933
00:52:12,039 --> 00:52:14,209
when you were talking to your son.

934
00:52:15,068 --> 00:52:16,439
I'm right, aren't I?

935
00:52:17,708 --> 00:52:19,678
What are you saying?

936
00:52:20,349 --> 00:52:22,879
My Do Ra isn't Ji Young.

937
00:52:23,449 --> 00:52:24,918
I might be a crappy mom,

938
00:52:24,918 --> 00:52:27,988
but would I tell you
something like that?

939
00:52:28,449 --> 00:52:30,019
No.

940
00:52:30,489 --> 00:52:32,318
Get out of the way. I need a taxi.

941
00:52:32,489 --> 00:52:34,329
Taxi!

942
00:52:48,338 --> 00:52:49,769
It's true.

943
00:52:50,478 --> 00:52:51,939
Kim Ji Young...

944
00:52:53,009 --> 00:52:54,479
was Park Do Ra.

945
00:52:55,478 --> 00:52:56,948
Park Do Ra.

946
00:52:58,219 --> 00:52:59,618
Do Ra!

947
00:53:03,418 --> 00:53:05,689
That punk Ko Pil Seung knew.

948
00:53:06,858 --> 00:53:08,658
Only I was in the dark.

949
00:53:09,789 --> 00:53:12,129
I was the moron all along.

950
00:53:17,768 --> 00:53:21,309
Thank you so much
for accepting my Ji Young...

951
00:53:21,309 --> 00:53:24,785
who is so naive and immature.

952
00:53:24,809 --> 00:53:27,179
I can't say much about her,

953
00:53:27,179 --> 00:53:30,994
but I can say I raised her
to be a good, sweet girl.

954
00:53:31,018 --> 00:53:34,088
She's better than anyone
when it comes to...

955
00:53:34,088 --> 00:53:36,294
respecting her elders.

956
00:53:36,318 --> 00:53:40,189
If you think she needs to learn,
do teach her well for me.

957
00:53:45,958 --> 00:53:49,368
Why do you all look like...

958
00:53:49,529 --> 00:53:51,769
you swallowed a bug?

959
00:53:51,869 --> 00:53:54,809
Do you not like Ji Young?

960
00:53:55,009 --> 00:53:58,485
Not at all. We do like her.

961
00:53:58,509 --> 00:54:01,584
She did great
as the lead in Pil Seung's drama,

962
00:54:01,608 --> 00:54:04,579
and a pretty and famous actress
is about to join our family.

963
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:07,925
It's an honor. It is, really.

964
00:54:07,949 --> 00:54:09,988
What? It's an honor?

965
00:54:10,659 --> 00:54:13,189
What is wrong with him?

966
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,865
What's wrong?

967
00:54:14,889 --> 00:54:17,698
What's the matter?
Did someone pinch you?

968
00:54:19,699 --> 00:54:20,699
Seriously.

969
00:54:20,699 --> 00:54:22,598
Pil Seung.

970
00:54:22,998 --> 00:54:25,144
Where will you live once you marry?

971
00:54:25,168 --> 00:54:28,914
Ji Young will move in with you
for now, right?

972
00:54:28,938 --> 00:54:32,008
No. I'll move in with Ji Young.

973
00:54:32,739 --> 00:54:34,149
What?

974
00:54:35,279 --> 00:54:36,908
To look after her grandmother.

975
00:54:40,449 --> 00:54:41,749
My goodness.

976
00:54:42,518 --> 00:54:46,595
<i>Until the day the East Sea runs dry</i>

977
00:54:46,619 --> 00:54:50,934
<i>- And Mount Baekdu is worn away</i>
- Grandma.

978
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:53,559
<i>May the deities protect our nation</i>

979
00:54:53,559 --> 00:54:54,898
Oh, no...

980
00:54:54,898 --> 00:54:58,639
<i>- Mount Baekdu is worn away</i>
- You don't have to sing.

981
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:00,568
What are you doing, Grandma?

982
00:55:00,568 --> 00:55:03,608
<i>- Hurray to Korea</i>
- It's okay.

983
00:55:03,608 --> 00:55:06,354
- Calm down, Grandma.
<i>- May the Rose of Sharon</i>

984
00:55:06,378 --> 00:55:08,579
<i>Bloom for miles</i>

985
00:55:08,579 --> 00:55:12,318
It's like cooking a fancy meal
and giving it to the dogs.

986
00:55:12,548 --> 00:55:15,019
What should we do about this?

987
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:18,873
(Yerim)

988
00:55:18,989 --> 00:55:20,018
It's lovely.

989
00:55:21,207 --> 00:55:25,630
(Interior design)

990
00:55:35,509 --> 00:55:36,809
What are you doing?

991
00:55:39,009 --> 00:55:40,239
There's lighting in this.

992
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:41,978
(Yerim)

993
00:55:41,978 --> 00:55:43,348
Do you like it?

994
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:49,118
I think it would look nice
in our dressing room.

995
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:53,658
"Our dressing room?"

996
00:55:54,989 --> 00:55:58,298
It feels like
we're actually getting married.

997
00:56:00,898 --> 00:56:03,715
I'm feeling generous.
Pick out everything you like.

998
00:56:03,739 --> 00:56:04,974
What?

999
00:56:04,998 --> 00:56:07,609
No. It's too expensive.

1000
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:13,285
What are you doing?

1001
00:56:13,309 --> 00:56:16,149
We should see how it looks
from the inside.

1002
00:56:47,349 --> 00:56:48,678
Park Do Ra.

1003
00:56:50,478 --> 00:56:52,479
You were really Park Do Ra?

1004
00:56:56,449 --> 00:56:57,789
Was that why...

1005
00:56:58,918 --> 00:57:01,528
whenever I saw
the country bumpkin Kim Ji Young,

1006
00:57:03,659 --> 00:57:05,258
my heart ached,

1007
00:57:05,858 --> 00:57:08,598
and I couldn't see straight
as if I was on something?

1008
00:57:20,708 --> 00:57:22,178
Park Do Ra.

1009
00:57:22,809 --> 00:57:24,519
After you died,

1010
00:57:25,878 --> 00:57:28,394
I spent so many days in tears.

1011
00:57:28,418 --> 00:57:30,718
Why are you with that punk?

1012
00:57:31,458 --> 00:57:34,758
Park Do Ra. If I can't have you,

1013
00:57:34,958 --> 00:57:36,959
Ko Pil Seung won't have you either.

1014
00:57:44,768 --> 00:57:46,169
No.

1015
00:57:47,239 --> 00:57:48,609
No.

1016
00:57:50,208 --> 00:57:52,439
I won't end you this easily.

1017
00:57:55,009 --> 00:57:57,149
I suffered a great deal.

1018
00:57:58,449 --> 00:58:00,348
The two of you should suffer
just as much.

1019
00:58:02,418 --> 00:58:03,818
You two.

1020
00:58:33,279 --> 00:58:35,118
Where is she?

1021
00:58:35,349 --> 00:58:38,119
- My goodness.
- Look at you!

1022
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:40,489
- You look stunning.
- How beautiful.

1023
00:58:40,489 --> 00:58:42,759
- You look gorgeous.
- Congratulations.

1024
00:58:42,759 --> 00:58:44,358
Thank you all for coming.

1025
00:58:44,358 --> 00:58:46,228
What is this?
When did you guys start dating?

1026
00:58:46,228 --> 00:58:48,829
You never showed it on set,
and you're suddenly getting married?

1027
00:58:48,998 --> 00:58:51,068
They totally fooled us!

1028
00:58:51,338 --> 00:58:53,715
I kind of knew.

1029
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:56,768
What? Why didn't you give us
a heads-up?

1030
00:58:56,768 --> 00:58:59,239
All right. We should record
this historic moment,

1031
00:58:59,239 --> 00:59:00,978
so why don't we all
take a picture together?

1032
00:59:00,978 --> 00:59:02,409
- Shall we?
- No, I don't want to.

1033
00:59:02,409 --> 00:59:04,119
- Come on. Let's take a picture.
- All right.

1034
00:59:04,119 --> 00:59:06,119
- Ladies first. Take a seat.
- Yes.

1035
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:08,088
- All right. Let's take a picture.
- Sit here.

1036
00:59:08,088 --> 00:59:09,848
Shouldn't we call
the director of photography?

1037
00:59:10,018 --> 00:59:11,259
- Yes.
- He doesn't have his camera here.

1038
00:59:11,259 --> 00:59:12,818
He can just use that camera.

1039
00:59:12,818 --> 00:59:14,088
I already called him.

1040
00:59:14,088 --> 00:59:16,188
- What about her hair and makeup?
- She already got everything done.

1041
00:59:16,188 --> 00:59:18,029
- All right.
- Scoot over a bit.

1042
00:59:18,029 --> 00:59:20,128
- Do we all fit in the frame?
- Yes, I'll take it now.

1043
00:59:20,128 --> 00:59:22,968
- One, two, three.
- She looks so stunning,

1044
00:59:22,998 --> 00:59:24,338
- Smile!
- doesn't she?

1045
00:59:24,338 --> 00:59:25,838
- Yes, she does.
- Make a heart.

1046
00:59:25,838 --> 00:59:28,709
- No one's prettier than our sister.
- One, two, three.

1047
00:59:32,279 --> 00:59:34,548
- Let's smile!
- Great.

1048
00:59:38,748 --> 00:59:40,249
Mom, what are you doing here?

1049
00:59:40,648 --> 00:59:42,148
What? Am I not allowed to be here?

1050
00:59:42,148 --> 00:59:44,189
Mom, you know you can't be here!

1051
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:46,119
It makes no sense
that I can't be here...

1052
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:47,758
when you guys can.

1053
00:59:48,088 --> 00:59:50,405
You'd better not cause a scene here,
Mom.

1054
00:59:50,429 --> 00:59:52,399
Mom, you should just leave.

1055
00:59:52,529 --> 00:59:54,469
No, I'll stay
and watch their wedding.

1056
00:59:54,469 --> 00:59:55,929
I can't stand that fool,
Ko Pil Seung,

1057
00:59:55,929 --> 00:59:57,199
but I must watch my Do Ra
get married...

1058
00:59:57,199 --> 01:00:00,339
Seriously! I told you
not to call her Do Ra.

1059
01:00:01,239 --> 01:00:03,544
I must watch Ji Young's wedding
before I leave.

1060
01:00:03,568 --> 01:00:06,208
I am the CEO of Ji Young's agency.

1061
01:00:06,208 --> 01:00:08,149
Don't be so rude to me.

1062
01:00:10,878 --> 01:00:12,479
My goodness.

1063
01:00:14,748 --> 01:00:15,894
Pil Seung!

1064
01:00:15,918 --> 01:00:18,458
Pil Seung, you look so handsome
and dashing today.

1065
01:00:18,458 --> 01:00:20,418
- Congratulations, seriously.
- Thanks.

1066
01:00:20,418 --> 01:00:23,428
Yes, Pil Seung.
You look dashing today.

1067
01:00:25,228 --> 01:00:26,729
By the way,

1068
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:28,928
where is Chairman Gong?

1069
01:00:29,369 --> 01:00:32,239
I guess my dad doesn't approve
of their marriage.

1070
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:33,869
He said he didn't want to attend
the wedding,

1071
01:00:33,869 --> 01:00:35,769
so he and Mom got into a fight
in the morning.

1072
01:00:36,009 --> 01:00:37,309
Ma Ri.

1073
01:00:37,608 --> 01:00:40,039
My goodness. I totally understand
why he said that.

1074
01:00:41,608 --> 01:00:45,149
Please don't get the wrong idea.
Something urgent has come up.

1075
01:00:47,389 --> 01:00:48,689
Yes, go on in.

1076
01:00:50,289 --> 01:00:53,258
Seriously? What is the matter
with Chairman Gong?

1077
01:00:53,588 --> 01:00:56,859
Pil Seung is his adopted son now,
so he is Pil Seung's father.

1078
01:00:57,088 --> 01:00:59,528
How could he not attend
Pil Seung's wedding?

1079
01:01:00,699 --> 01:01:03,329
What if he cancels his decision
to adopt Pil Seung?

1080
01:01:03,329 --> 01:01:06,845
My goodness, Mom.
Must you say that on this happy day?

1081
01:01:06,869 --> 01:01:09,744
You should be giving them
your blessing, if anything.

1082
01:01:09,768 --> 01:01:13,109
Good grief. Happy day, my foot.

1083
01:01:13,509 --> 01:01:16,448
My blood is boiling right now.

1084
01:01:17,009 --> 01:01:18,318
Hey, Pil Seung!

1085
01:01:18,478 --> 01:01:20,778
My, you're getting hitched!

1086
01:01:20,989 --> 01:01:22,695
Pil Seung, Ko Pil Seung!

1087
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:25,159
My gosh. Ji Young always took
such good care of you...

1088
01:01:25,159 --> 01:01:27,934
even when she worked with you
on your team as a crew member.

1089
01:01:27,958 --> 01:01:30,128
Ko Pil Seung, you are a lucky man.

1090
01:01:30,128 --> 01:01:31,759
Live a happy life with her!

1091
01:01:31,759 --> 01:01:33,429
Thank you!

1092
01:01:33,429 --> 01:01:34,898
- I'm happy for you.
- Sir, you must be jealous.

1093
01:01:34,898 --> 01:01:37,938
- My goodness. He looks so happy.
- You should remarry.

1094
01:01:37,938 --> 01:01:41,009
- Oh, boy. That fool.
- Pil Seung looks like James Bond.

1095
01:01:41,009 --> 01:01:42,139
Right?

1096
01:01:42,139 --> 01:01:45,278
My gosh. He can't hide
how happy he is right now.

1097
01:01:53,318 --> 01:01:54,689
Do Jun.

1098
01:01:55,349 --> 01:01:57,289
What are you doing here?

1099
01:01:58,018 --> 01:01:59,589
It's been a while.

1100
01:02:01,989 --> 01:02:03,758
No, not for me.

1101
01:02:04,059 --> 01:02:06,798
The other day,
I went to your place...

1102
01:02:07,498 --> 01:02:08,999
and saw you.

1103
01:02:09,728 --> 01:02:11,968
You came to my place? Why?

1104
01:02:12,268 --> 01:02:15,169
Don't you know why? Obviously,
I went there because I missed you.

1105
01:02:17,009 --> 01:02:19,479
Didn't you miss me?

1106
01:02:21,409 --> 01:02:23,178
We said we'd never see
each other again.

1107
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:26,118
So, don't do that again.

1108
01:02:27,148 --> 01:02:28,488
Bye.

1109
01:02:33,659 --> 01:02:35,459
Park Do Jun, you're a jerk.

1110
01:02:37,088 --> 01:02:39,305
Thank you all for your patience.

1111
01:02:39,329 --> 01:02:42,168
Only the families
and close acquaintances...

1112
01:02:42,168 --> 01:02:44,668
of the bride and groom
were invited today...

1113
01:02:44,668 --> 01:02:48,138
to witness this ceremony
and their true love.

1114
01:02:48,739 --> 01:02:50,878
Since it's a small wedding,

1115
01:02:50,878 --> 01:02:53,178
I need all the guests
who are here today...

1116
01:02:53,279 --> 01:02:55,878
to applaud and congratulate
the bride and groom...

1117
01:02:55,878 --> 01:02:58,079
as enthusiastically as you can.

1118
01:02:58,849 --> 01:03:02,724
All right. The groom will enter now.

1119
01:03:02,748 --> 01:03:04,434
When he enters,

1120
01:03:04,458 --> 01:03:08,129
please welcome him
with a big round of applause.

1121
01:03:09,829 --> 01:03:12,428
The groom may enter now!

1122
01:03:15,829 --> 01:03:17,329
You look dashing!

1123
01:03:19,668 --> 01:03:21,115
How handsome!

1124
01:03:21,139 --> 01:03:22,738
What a handsome groom!

1125
01:03:25,079 --> 01:03:26,755
Did someone die?

1126
01:03:26,779 --> 01:03:28,678
We decided
we'd let them get married.

1127
01:03:28,878 --> 01:03:31,348
Stop crying, okay? It's a happy day.

1128
01:03:31,378 --> 01:03:32,749
"A happy day?"

1129
01:03:33,248 --> 01:03:36,118
I will really divorce you
the moment we leave this wedding.

1130
01:03:36,349 --> 01:03:37,988
Get ready to go to court.

1131
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:54,539
All right. Next, it's the highlight
of this ceremony.

1132
01:03:54,838 --> 01:03:56,339
The woman of the hour.

1133
01:03:56,668 --> 01:03:58,479
The bride will enter now.

1134
01:03:58,739 --> 01:04:00,208
When the bride enters,

1135
01:04:00,208 --> 01:04:04,008
please welcome her
with a big round of applause.

1136
01:04:05,449 --> 01:04:08,019
The bride may enter now.

1137
01:04:38,048 --> 01:04:41,589
- Ji Young!
- Ji Young!

1138
01:04:41,719 --> 01:04:43,019
Ji Young!

1139
01:04:43,418 --> 01:04:45,635
- Ji Young.
- Are you really Park Do Ra?

1140
01:04:45,659 --> 01:04:46,918
Did you undergo
major plastic surgery...

1141
01:04:46,918 --> 01:04:48,329
to lie that you were Kim Ji Young?

1142
01:04:48,329 --> 01:04:49,759
Did you deceive
Director Ko Pil Seung too?

1143
01:04:49,759 --> 01:04:51,759
Does Director Ko Pil Seung also know
that you are Park Do Ra?

1144
01:04:51,759 --> 01:04:53,798
Does it mean he knew everything
from the get-go?

1145
01:04:53,798 --> 01:04:55,199
Did you two deceive everyone together?

1146
01:04:55,199 --> 01:04:57,769
- Did Director Ko also...
- Why did you hide it?

1147
01:04:57,969 --> 01:04:59,899
- Tell us.
- A comment, please.

1148
01:05:05,343 --> 01:05:08,218
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1149
01:05:40,321 --> 01:05:43,361
Everyone is hurling stones
at Pil Seung.

1150
01:05:43,361 --> 01:05:46,562
How could we let him marry her,
knowing that?

1151
01:05:46,662 --> 01:05:48,401
Honey, have you lost your mind?

1152
01:05:48,401 --> 01:05:51,341
Mom, you told the reporters
that Ji Young was Do Ra, didn't you?

1153
01:05:51,341 --> 01:05:52,742
I'm okay.

1154
01:05:52,742 --> 01:05:54,372
But what about you?

1155
01:05:54,372 --> 01:05:57,012
Why do you have to be criticized
like this because of me?

1156
01:05:57,012 --> 01:05:59,542
Where is my Ji Young?

1157
01:05:59,542 --> 01:06:02,412
Find my Ji Young.
Hurry up and find her.

1158
01:06:02,412 --> 01:06:04,352
Park Do Ra, where are you?

1159
01:06:04,352 --> 01:06:05,921
You promised me
you wouldn't do this.

1160
01:06:05,921 --> 01:06:08,698
You promised me you'd never let
my hand go no matter what.

1161
01:06:08,722 --> 01:06:11,721
I thought it was only right
for me to sort this out.

1162
01:06:11,762 --> 01:06:15,592
Sorry for making this decision
on my own without telling you.
