(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:08,354 --> 00:00:11,993
Please forgive me this once.
Please let it go this once.

3
00:00:11,993 --> 00:00:15,524
If you do, I'll do anything.

4
00:00:15,524 --> 00:00:18,243
I'll do anything you want.

5
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:20,343
Please let it go...

6
00:00:20,694 --> 00:00:22,243
this once.

7
00:00:24,603 --> 00:00:25,814
Mr. Gong, please.

8
00:00:42,723 --> 00:00:43,933
You should get back on your feet.

9
00:00:46,823 --> 00:00:48,040
Mr. Gong.

10
00:00:48,064 --> 00:00:50,823
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

11
00:00:50,823 --> 00:00:53,214
There was no need
to resort to such measures.

12
00:00:59,103 --> 00:01:00,414
Mr. Gong,

13
00:01:01,073 --> 00:01:04,454
I'm currently
in a helpless situation.

14
00:01:05,514 --> 00:01:08,914
If Do Ra doesn't shoot commercials
or doesn't get any acting jobs,

15
00:01:08,914 --> 00:01:11,213
things will be devastating for me.

16
00:01:11,213 --> 00:01:14,764
It'll be over
for the agency and Do Ra.

17
00:01:15,383 --> 00:01:16,564
Tell me about it.

18
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:19,934
Anything worth liquidating
is being held as collateral,

19
00:01:20,324 --> 00:01:21,904
and you're drowning in debt.

20
00:01:22,824 --> 00:01:24,144
Things are bad.

21
00:01:24,363 --> 00:01:27,514
How do you know about that?

22
00:01:29,133 --> 00:01:32,053
Meanwhile, Ms. Park is unaware...

23
00:01:32,234 --> 00:01:33,484
of this situation.

24
00:01:33,633 --> 00:01:37,273
Mr. Gong,
Do Ra can't know about this.

25
00:01:37,273 --> 00:01:38,643
Ms. Baek,

26
00:01:38,643 --> 00:01:41,824
that's why Ms. Park
is being immature.

27
00:01:42,383 --> 00:01:43,463
Seriously.

28
00:01:44,883 --> 00:01:46,363
If she had known...

29
00:01:47,413 --> 00:01:49,333
her castle was made out of sand,

30
00:01:50,154 --> 00:01:52,034
she would've made a wiser choice.

31
00:01:53,624 --> 00:01:55,044
Not knowing that...

32
00:01:55,564 --> 00:01:57,374
resulted in her cocky attitude.

33
00:01:58,594 --> 00:01:59,609
Don't you agree?

34
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:02,213
Mr. Gong, I hear you.

35
00:02:02,503 --> 00:02:04,684
I get what you're saying.

36
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,083
So please...

37
00:02:06,604 --> 00:02:10,124
Give me another chance.
Please let this go.

38
00:02:10,273 --> 00:02:12,720
Just leave, will you?

39
00:02:12,744 --> 00:02:14,693
If I recall, you were the one...

40
00:02:16,144 --> 00:02:17,424
who drew a line between us.

41
00:02:17,814 --> 00:02:18,883
I said I would do anything.

42
00:02:18,883 --> 00:02:21,154
I'll do anything you want.

43
00:02:21,154 --> 00:02:23,353
So please... Just this once...

44
00:02:23,353 --> 00:02:26,494
I wouldn't dream of deceiving you
not when I'm in this situation.

45
00:02:26,494 --> 00:02:27,634
Right?

46
00:02:44,714 --> 00:02:46,344
What can I do...

47
00:02:46,344 --> 00:02:48,894
when Do Ra is head over heels
for that punk Ko Dae Chung?

48
00:02:51,783 --> 00:02:53,664
Should I just tell her the truth?

49
00:02:54,614 --> 00:02:55,883
That we're swimming in debt...

50
00:02:55,883 --> 00:02:57,504
and we could lose everything?

51
00:02:58,024 --> 00:02:59,704
Will she listen to me then?

52
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:04,674
Gosh, no.
That will only cause more problems.

53
00:03:05,233 --> 00:03:07,613
Then what can I do?

54
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,313
Of course.

55
00:03:13,473 --> 00:03:15,984
That's what I should at least do.

56
00:03:16,904 --> 00:03:18,424
That's what I should do.

57
00:03:26,913 --> 00:03:29,353
Mom, my heart
is pounding in my chest.

58
00:03:29,353 --> 00:03:30,924
What if he's so cool...

59
00:03:30,924 --> 00:03:33,373
that I'm not able
to lock eyes with him?

60
00:03:34,124 --> 00:03:37,204
It's all right. Don't be nervous
and have some water.

61
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:39,213
Sure.

62
00:03:40,193 --> 00:03:41,843
Gosh, there they are.

63
00:03:47,073 --> 00:03:49,683
Am I being set up with that old man?

64
00:03:49,904 --> 00:03:52,043
That old man
walking beside the bald geezer?

65
00:03:52,043 --> 00:03:53,354
Ma Ri, please.

66
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:55,694
Stand up.

67
00:03:55,913 --> 00:03:57,943
Chairman Gong,
you arrived here first.

68
00:03:57,943 --> 00:03:59,664
- It's good to see you.
- Hi.

69
00:03:59,983 --> 00:04:01,453
- Director Yang.
- Hello, sir.

70
00:04:01,453 --> 00:04:03,063
We got here sooner than expected.

71
00:04:03,524 --> 00:04:05,124
Ms. Jang, have you been well?

72
00:04:05,124 --> 00:04:06,353
It's good to see you.

73
00:04:06,353 --> 00:04:07,604
Hello, ma'am.

74
00:04:12,064 --> 00:04:13,944
Ma Ri, go ahead and greet them.

75
00:04:16,434 --> 00:04:17,514
Hey.

76
00:04:18,774 --> 00:04:20,934
Let's all sit down.
Please take a seat.

77
00:04:20,934 --> 00:04:24,003
Mr. Gong, why don't
we let them talk...

78
00:04:24,003 --> 00:04:26,124
and grab a coffee
by ourselves elsewhere?

79
00:04:27,614 --> 00:04:28,723
Maybe we should.

80
00:04:29,184 --> 00:04:32,753
Director Yang, I hope
you'll entertain Ma Ri for us.

81
00:04:32,753 --> 00:04:34,513
Sure thing. Thank you, sir.

82
00:04:34,513 --> 00:04:35,733
- Honey.
- Right.

83
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,264
Shall we?

84
00:04:38,893 --> 00:04:40,770
- Ma Ri...
- Sure.

85
00:04:40,794 --> 00:04:41,903
See you.

86
00:04:51,604 --> 00:04:52,754
Let's sit.

87
00:05:00,643 --> 00:05:01,723
Hey.

88
00:05:03,044 --> 00:05:05,264
Mom, Dad.
How could you do this to me?

89
00:05:05,314 --> 00:05:08,804
How could you set me up
with such an old guy?

90
00:05:09,023 --> 00:05:12,753
Ma Ri. I told you
he was older than you.

91
00:05:12,753 --> 00:05:14,074
You said you didn't mind.

92
00:05:14,593 --> 00:05:15,903
I did,

93
00:05:16,364 --> 00:05:19,244
but I thought he'd be like
an older brother, not middle-aged.

94
00:05:19,934 --> 00:05:21,879
Whatever. I don't like him.

95
00:05:21,903 --> 00:05:24,444
He's not my type. It's a no.

96
00:05:26,203 --> 00:05:27,283
Ma Ri.

97
00:05:27,804 --> 00:05:30,544
You can't judge someone
based on their looks.

98
00:05:30,544 --> 00:05:33,423
You must look into their mind
and see their character.

99
00:05:33,614 --> 00:05:36,694
That man seemed
reliable and trustworthy.

100
00:05:37,314 --> 00:05:40,733
I think he's a good person.

101
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:44,383
Don't be like this.
Meet him a few more times, Ma Ri.

102
00:05:44,383 --> 00:05:47,193
If you like him that much,
you can date him, Dad.

103
00:05:47,193 --> 00:05:48,903
You date him instead.

104
00:06:26,034 --> 00:06:27,144
Hey.

105
00:06:27,893 --> 00:06:30,144
Why are you here? Where's Jae Dong?

106
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:33,474
Jae Dong said something came up,
so I sent him home.

107
00:06:33,474 --> 00:06:35,773
The job's at Ganghwa Island,

108
00:06:35,773 --> 00:06:38,824
so I thought we could make it
a mom-daughter date.

109
00:06:38,943 --> 00:06:40,954
I'll serve you well today, Ms. Park.

110
00:06:41,013 --> 00:06:43,293
Okay. Thank you, Ms. Baek.

111
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:52,134
Mom. Why did the shoot date
change so suddenly?

112
00:06:52,224 --> 00:06:54,724
You can't change dates
just like that.

113
00:06:54,724 --> 00:06:56,173
What if I had another project?

114
00:06:56,393 --> 00:06:57,893
Things happen all the time.

115
00:06:57,893 --> 00:07:00,713
I agreed to the change
because you were free today.

116
00:07:01,034 --> 00:07:02,783
- Wear your seatbelt.
- Okay.

117
00:07:05,474 --> 00:07:06,713
Mom.

118
00:07:07,633 --> 00:07:10,283
It's been so long
since we hung out together.

119
00:07:10,604 --> 00:07:12,423
- Yes.
- After the shoot,

120
00:07:12,843 --> 00:07:14,773
shall we eat something nice there?

121
00:07:14,773 --> 00:07:16,663
Yes. Let's do that.

122
00:07:17,984 --> 00:07:20,264
- Can we get going?
- Yes.

123
00:07:32,164 --> 00:07:33,534
(Pil Seung...)

124
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:38,687
Pil Seung, where are you?

125
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,957
I'm at the office. You?

126
00:07:44,728 --> 00:07:47,397
I'm on my way to Ganghwa Island
with my mom for a photo shoot.

127
00:07:47,844 --> 00:07:49,183
I want to hang out with you.

128
00:07:53,983 --> 00:07:55,724
Didn't you say you were free today?

129
00:07:56,923 --> 00:07:59,923
I was, but there was
a sudden schedule change.

130
00:08:00,853 --> 00:08:03,623
I have to go
to Ganghwa Island for the shoot.

131
00:08:03,623 --> 00:08:04,863
I'll be back pretty late.

132
00:08:07,094 --> 00:08:09,733
That's okay. Text when you're done.

133
00:08:10,334 --> 00:08:12,974
I will. See you later.

134
00:08:13,204 --> 00:08:14,334
Kiss, kiss.

135
00:08:17,543 --> 00:08:20,113
She says "kiss, kiss" too randomly.

136
00:08:21,014 --> 00:08:22,414
- Who does?
- My gosh.

137
00:08:23,844 --> 00:08:25,884
Can you make a sound
when you come in?

138
00:08:25,884 --> 00:08:27,853
Why are you always scaring people?

139
00:08:29,024 --> 00:08:30,253
Are you dating?

140
00:08:30,353 --> 00:08:31,853
As if I'm dating.

141
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,024
Did you give me the time
to meet someone?

142
00:08:38,024 --> 00:08:39,994
That's so suspicious.

143
00:08:43,734 --> 00:08:47,234
The air's much cleaner out here.

144
00:08:52,144 --> 00:08:54,744
Mom. Why isn't there anyone else?

145
00:08:55,683 --> 00:08:57,014
Is this the right place?

146
00:08:57,284 --> 00:08:59,154
Yes, it is.

147
00:08:59,154 --> 00:09:02,124
I left early to avoid the traffic.
Did we arrive too soon?

148
00:09:02,524 --> 00:09:04,583
Is that it?
The crew will be here soon, then.

149
00:09:05,154 --> 00:09:06,154
Let's go inside.

150
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,994
Gosh, I almost forgot.

151
00:09:08,453 --> 00:09:10,323
The car's low on gas.

152
00:09:10,963 --> 00:09:13,693
I'll fill it up
at a nearby gas station.

153
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:14,864
You go inside.

154
00:09:14,864 --> 00:09:17,703
The gas station here might close
if we wait until too late.

155
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,774
It's in the middle of nowhere.
Go on in.

156
00:09:20,104 --> 00:09:21,173
Okay.

157
00:09:21,374 --> 00:09:23,604
- Bring my bag with you.
- I will.

158
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,223
I'm not setting her up
with a weirdo.

159
00:09:42,524 --> 00:09:45,734
I hope she opens up
to Mr. Gong today.

160
00:09:47,164 --> 00:09:48,604
Do as I say this time.

161
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,164
Please, Do Ra.

162
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:53,774
It's the only way to save us all.

163
00:10:08,823 --> 00:10:10,323
Is anyone here?

164
00:10:16,524 --> 00:10:17,994
Is this the set?

165
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,933
It doesn't look right.

166
00:10:24,504 --> 00:10:25,973
It must be the wrong place.

167
00:10:26,904 --> 00:10:27,933
Hang on.

168
00:10:31,543 --> 00:10:33,014
My phone's in my bag.

169
00:10:47,024 --> 00:10:48,024
Mr. Gong.

170
00:10:49,894 --> 00:10:51,293
Why are you here?

171
00:10:52,994 --> 00:10:56,134
I mean,
why did you come all the way here?

172
00:10:57,534 --> 00:11:01,433
Do Ra. Your mother arranged this.

173
00:11:02,374 --> 00:11:03,404
What?

174
00:11:04,673 --> 00:11:06,443
- My mom?
- Yes.

175
00:11:07,713 --> 00:11:09,943
There seems to be
a misunderstanding,

176
00:11:10,284 --> 00:11:12,484
and you don't seem to know me.

177
00:11:13,284 --> 00:11:14,313
Do Ra.

178
00:11:14,784 --> 00:11:17,223
Let's talk openly over some wine.

179
00:11:17,384 --> 00:11:18,953
Take a seat.

180
00:11:18,953 --> 00:11:20,423
Wait, hold on.

181
00:11:22,463 --> 00:11:23,463
Are you saying...

182
00:11:24,423 --> 00:11:28,593
you and my mom plotted together
to get me here?

183
00:11:30,404 --> 00:11:32,234
How could you stoop this low?

184
00:11:34,073 --> 00:11:35,404
What do you mean "low?"

185
00:11:36,203 --> 00:11:37,573
I just want to talk.

186
00:11:37,904 --> 00:11:41,443
I told you many times
I'm not interested in you.

187
00:11:41,443 --> 00:11:42,583
Why are you doing this?

188
00:11:43,843 --> 00:11:45,354
I have to go.

189
00:11:47,313 --> 00:11:48,384
Do Ra.

190
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,083
I told you just now.

191
00:11:51,953 --> 00:11:53,723
I didn't set this up.

192
00:11:54,323 --> 00:11:55,664
Your mother did.

193
00:11:57,624 --> 00:12:00,894
She wants us to get together.

194
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:05,374
So you can relax and speak freely.

195
00:12:05,374 --> 00:12:06,433
No.

196
00:12:07,473 --> 00:12:09,404
My mom must've made a mistake.

197
00:12:10,404 --> 00:12:12,073
I'll apologize in her place.

198
00:12:13,543 --> 00:12:15,683
Sorry. I have to go.

199
00:12:19,884 --> 00:12:21,453
I just want to talk.

200
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:23,583
Is that so hard?

201
00:12:25,654 --> 00:12:27,593
You don't even want to talk to me?

202
00:12:28,994 --> 00:12:30,063
Why not?

203
00:12:30,823 --> 00:12:32,164
Are you that special?

204
00:12:33,394 --> 00:12:34,634
Let go of me.

205
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,904
Stop it. Let go!

206
00:12:37,904 --> 00:12:38,973
No!

207
00:12:39,404 --> 00:12:40,604
We're both here.

208
00:12:42,104 --> 00:12:43,673
You can't leave
without my permission.

209
00:12:45,203 --> 00:12:47,673
You walked in freely, but leaving...

210
00:12:48,813 --> 00:12:50,144
requires clearance.

211
00:12:53,183 --> 00:12:54,813
No. I don't want to stay.

212
00:12:54,813 --> 00:12:56,723
Let go of me. I don't want this.

213
00:12:56,784 --> 00:12:57,854
Let go!

214
00:13:07,764 --> 00:13:09,333
How dare you hit me?

215
00:13:12,303 --> 00:13:13,404
Come here!

216
00:13:16,244 --> 00:13:17,343
Let go.

217
00:13:18,343 --> 00:13:19,374
Let me go!

218
00:13:25,754 --> 00:13:26,953
What are you doing?

219
00:13:28,213 --> 00:13:29,284
Do you know...

220
00:13:29,854 --> 00:13:31,423
I'm trying so hard to hold back?

221
00:13:33,154 --> 00:13:34,854
Don't anger me any more than this.

222
00:13:35,894 --> 00:13:38,994
I don't want to hurt you,

223
00:13:39,793 --> 00:13:41,264
I don't want you to suffer.

224
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,534
So don't drive me crazy.

225
00:13:45,203 --> 00:13:46,234
Okay?

226
00:13:48,904 --> 00:13:51,404
Fine. Let me ask you something.

227
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,744
What did I do that was so wrong?

228
00:13:56,244 --> 00:13:59,514
All I wanted was to have a chat.

229
00:14:00,654 --> 00:14:02,654
Why did you react
like I was a freak?

230
00:14:08,923 --> 00:14:09,994
Ms. Park.

231
00:14:11,423 --> 00:14:13,894
You seem to have things very wrong.

232
00:14:15,093 --> 00:14:18,664
This event was my way
of giving you a chance.

233
00:14:20,203 --> 00:14:22,774
So when you're ready
to open up enough to talk,

234
00:14:23,774 --> 00:14:25,303
we'll talk then.

235
00:14:41,994 --> 00:14:43,093
Open it.

236
00:14:43,494 --> 00:14:44,723
Open the door!

237
00:14:45,563 --> 00:14:46,833
Open it now.

238
00:14:47,764 --> 00:14:48,933
Help me.

239
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:52,734
Help me! I'm locked up in here.

240
00:14:53,203 --> 00:14:55,274
It's no use shouting like that.

241
00:14:56,374 --> 00:14:58,203
There's no one else around here.

242
00:14:59,144 --> 00:15:02,043
And no one can come in here
without my permission.

243
00:15:03,313 --> 00:15:04,644
This is my vacation home.

244
00:15:07,553 --> 00:15:08,583
Open it.

245
00:15:10,024 --> 00:15:11,423
Please open the door.

246
00:15:11,624 --> 00:15:13,223
Let me out!

247
00:15:14,193 --> 00:15:15,223
What do I do?

248
00:15:34,644 --> 00:15:35,843
Mr. Gong.

249
00:15:39,484 --> 00:15:40,784
Are you there?

250
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,364
Why?

251
00:15:55,034 --> 00:15:56,764
Are you ready to talk to me now?

252
00:16:00,134 --> 00:16:01,134
Yes.

253
00:16:16,683 --> 00:16:17,923
It must've been stuffy in here.

254
00:16:19,124 --> 00:16:20,823
You should've been like this sooner.

255
00:16:24,923 --> 00:16:26,164
Can I go out now?

256
00:16:27,593 --> 00:16:28,894
Of course.

257
00:16:51,884 --> 00:16:54,093
Can I get some wine?

258
00:16:56,264 --> 00:16:57,293
Wine?

259
00:16:57,923 --> 00:16:58,923
Yes.

260
00:16:59,364 --> 00:17:00,364
Of course.

261
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,904
Do Ra, do you see this?

262
00:17:04,104 --> 00:17:05,104
Decanting.

263
00:17:08,734 --> 00:17:09,744
Oh, dear.

264
00:17:10,104 --> 00:17:13,144
I was really upset because of you.

265
00:17:13,144 --> 00:17:14,713
So I had some by myself.

266
00:17:15,713 --> 00:17:18,443
But I'm not drunk at all.

267
00:17:19,283 --> 00:17:22,783
I have no problem having
a heart-to-heart talk with you,

268
00:17:23,324 --> 00:17:25,923
so please don't worry.

269
00:17:30,564 --> 00:17:32,564
All right. This will do.

270
00:17:35,463 --> 00:17:37,763
I'm a little hungry.

271
00:17:40,104 --> 00:17:41,604
Do you have anything to eat?

272
00:17:42,344 --> 00:17:43,943
Cheese or something.

273
00:17:43,943 --> 00:17:44,943
Of course, I do.

274
00:17:45,604 --> 00:17:48,273
I have everything
that you would like.

275
00:17:48,673 --> 00:17:50,314
Just wait a moment.

276
00:18:25,084 --> 00:18:26,084
Do Ra...

277
00:18:31,654 --> 00:18:32,953
Park Do Ra!

278
00:18:35,993 --> 00:18:36,993
Darn it.

279
00:18:42,263 --> 00:18:43,364
Park Do Ra!

280
00:18:45,164 --> 00:18:46,433
Where did you go?

281
00:18:47,634 --> 00:18:49,804
Do you think
you can get away with this?

282
00:19:04,223 --> 00:19:05,223
Fine.

283
00:19:06,054 --> 00:19:07,294
Just go!

284
00:19:08,554 --> 00:19:10,493
I don't need a woman...

285
00:19:11,294 --> 00:19:13,263
who refuses to be with me!

286
00:20:18,094 --> 00:20:20,294
Excuse me! Ma'am!

287
00:20:25,973 --> 00:20:27,804
Is Do Ra still working?

288
00:20:31,304 --> 00:20:33,713
She said she would call me
after finishing work.

289
00:20:42,183 --> 00:20:43,183
Hello?

290
00:20:43,723 --> 00:20:44,884
Pil Seung, it's me.

291
00:20:46,693 --> 00:20:47,693
Do Ra?

292
00:20:48,493 --> 00:20:49,723
What is this number?

293
00:20:50,394 --> 00:20:52,634
What's with your voice?
Is something wrong?

294
00:20:53,733 --> 00:20:55,533
Please come and pick me up.

295
00:20:57,304 --> 00:21:00,273
I don't have my purse or phone.

296
00:21:00,273 --> 00:21:02,804
I have nothing with me now.

297
00:21:03,874 --> 00:21:06,473
Pil Seung,
hurry and come to pick me up.

298
00:21:07,743 --> 00:21:09,783
I'm really scared.

299
00:21:09,783 --> 00:21:11,144
Hurry and come here.

300
00:21:12,654 --> 00:21:15,314
Do Ra, where are you now?

301
00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:41,499
Do Ra. Park Do Ra!

302
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,330
I think this is it.

303
00:21:46,669 --> 00:21:47,669
Do Ra.

304
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,070
Pil Seung.

305
00:21:52,169 --> 00:21:53,209
Do Ra.

306
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:57,810
Pil Seung.

307
00:21:58,749 --> 00:21:59,749
Do Ra.

308
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,790
What's with you?

309
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,659
What happened? Why are you alone?

310
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:08,890
Where's your mom?

311
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:11,030
Why are you here alone...

312
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,330
with no money or a phone
at this time of night?

313
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:16,759
The thing is...

314
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,640
Let's just go.

315
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:26,640
I want to get out of here.

316
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,080
Okay. I get it.

317
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:31,709
Let's go.

318
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:39,590
Now that I'm here, you'll be okay.

319
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,620
It's all right.

320
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:48,900
Are you feeling better now?

321
00:22:51,699 --> 00:22:52,729
Yes.

322
00:22:53,429 --> 00:22:54,469
Tell me now.

323
00:22:55,469 --> 00:22:57,169
What on earth happened?

324
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,419
I had a fight with Mom.

325
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,159
What are you talking about?

326
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:19,189
How bad was the fight?

327
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,729
How did you end up here like this?

328
00:23:20,729 --> 00:23:22,130
Your clothes are covered in dirt.

329
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,699
Did your mom leave you here?

330
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,100
Pil Seung.

331
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,080
I'll tell you later.

332
00:23:38,749 --> 00:23:39,810
Okay.

333
00:23:40,249 --> 00:23:41,719
Try to get some sleep for now.

334
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:43,380
I'll let you know
when we arrive in Seoul.

335
00:24:01,499 --> 00:24:03,900
You should've done a better job.

336
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,009
Because of you, we were
only able to make 300 dollars.

337
00:24:06,009 --> 00:24:07,310
Mom, I don't want to do this.

338
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,909
Why are you so selfish?

339
00:24:08,909 --> 00:24:10,239
If you don't want to do this,

340
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:12,380
let's all dive
into the Han River and die.

341
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,709
- Go.
- Mom.

342
00:24:13,709 --> 00:24:15,050
- Let's go and die.
- Mom, no. Please.

343
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,550
Move around.

344
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:19,919
Dance, Do Ra.

345
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:25,830
Mom.

346
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:29,360
I'm aching all over.

347
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,429
Please help me.

348
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,370
All right. I get it.

349
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:36,199
I hear you,
but you must film this scene.

350
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:39,340
Once you're done,
I'll take you to see a doctor.

351
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,810
Go ahead and film the scene.
Come on.

352
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,340
Get up already.

353
00:24:50,749 --> 00:24:51,820
Turn off the rain!

354
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,989
What's wrong with her?
See what's up!

355
00:24:55,719 --> 00:24:57,459
- Do Ra?
- Do Ra?

356
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,330
Call an ambulance.

357
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:01,900
I'm terribly sorry about this.

358
00:25:03,999 --> 00:25:07,739
Do Ra, just do as I say.

359
00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:09,570
It's like I said.

360
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,040
You need to book shows...

361
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,570
which will then lead
to ad campaigns.

362
00:25:13,739 --> 00:25:15,679
That's how we make money.

363
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,080
Do Ra?

364
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,689
Do Ra, what...

365
00:26:13,429 --> 00:26:14,499
What's going on?

366
00:26:16,169 --> 00:26:17,739
What on earth happened to you?

367
00:26:19,469 --> 00:26:20,509
I'm here.

368
00:26:21,709 --> 00:26:23,979
I'm here for you,
so tell me what's going on.

369
00:26:26,249 --> 00:26:27,310
Pil Seung.

370
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:32,719
Building a career
hasn't been easy for me.

371
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,620
It has been exhausting.

372
00:26:41,929 --> 00:26:43,300
On countless occasions,

373
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,330
I took on gigs
that I didn't want to do,

374
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:48,800
and I exhausted myself
to become a success.

375
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,880
I know.

376
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,209
But you've been doing so well.

377
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,219
I'm proud of you, Do Ra.

378
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,159
I believed...

379
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:14,429
that I had been enduring it all
like a champion so far.

380
00:27:16,659 --> 00:27:19,370
But I can't bear it
on days like this.

381
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,070
You see,

382
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:28,880
I have had it rough
because of my mom...

383
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,350
who only thinks of me as a machine
that spits money.

384
00:27:36,449 --> 00:27:40,189
Because of my mom,
I wanted to die today.

385
00:27:43,719 --> 00:27:46,890
Pil Seung, I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

386
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,459
She's my mom of all people.

387
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:55,640
If she was a stranger,
I could cut her out of my life.

388
00:27:55,999 --> 00:27:57,640
But she's my mom of all people.

389
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,239
She's my mom of all people.

390
00:28:06,749 --> 00:28:09,280
It's all right.

391
00:28:12,449 --> 00:28:13,519
Do Ra.

392
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:16,790
I don't know the whole story...

393
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,030
but do as you wish to do
from now on.

394
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,699
You don't have to try so hard.

395
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,790
It's not like I sold her...

396
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:48,219
to loan sharks or to someone worse.

397
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:51,530
Mr. Gong is a wealthy man,

398
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:54,390
and he'll be
APP Group's chairman someday.

399
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,929
But above all, he deeply adores you.

400
00:28:56,929 --> 00:28:59,100
What I did
won't hurt you in any way.

401
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,300
Do Ra, please... Just for tonight.

402
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:06,669
Our lives depend on you.
Do Ra, please.

403
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,280
Do Sik, is that you?

404
00:29:24,459 --> 00:29:25,489
Mom.

405
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:30,229
How could you do this to me?

406
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:33,570
Do Ra,

407
00:29:34,769 --> 00:29:36,040
how...

408
00:29:36,499 --> 00:29:38,509
How did you make it home?
Why are you here?

409
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:41,070
Are you really my mother?

410
00:29:42,479 --> 00:29:44,280
Am I really your daughter?

411
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:48,919
I want to request a DNA test
to know for sure.

412
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,620
You dragged me around
at a young age...

413
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,820
forcing me to sing on stage.

414
00:29:54,249 --> 00:29:57,219
Wasn't sucking all the money
I could make for you enough?

415
00:29:57,219 --> 00:29:58,590
How...

416
00:30:00,259 --> 00:30:03,530
How could you have abandoned me
at that house?

417
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:08,140
How could you have thought
to sell me to a man like him?

418
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:10,769
What more do you need?

419
00:30:10,939 --> 00:30:12,739
What don't you have?

420
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:15,310
Why are you biting my head off
when I did nothing wrong?

421
00:30:15,409 --> 00:30:17,340
There's nothing wrong with Mr. Gong!

422
00:30:17,909 --> 00:30:21,419
Hey, try asking anyone on the street.

423
00:30:21,479 --> 00:30:23,419
Who would they choose...

424
00:30:23,419 --> 00:30:25,650
between APP Group's heir apparent
and that lousy foundling?

425
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:28,290
Ask which one of us
is in her right mind.

426
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:32,929
Also, you ought to be grateful
that someone like Mr. Gong...

427
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:34,830
has taken a liking to you.

428
00:30:35,199 --> 00:30:38,669
But of all people,
you chose to date Ko Dae Chung!

429
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,199
Are you defending your actions?

430
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,640
That's right. I stand by my actions.

431
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,310
And what I did was for your sake.

432
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:50,439
So how could you
have come home tonight?

433
00:30:50,509 --> 00:30:53,150
How could you
have ruined everything?

434
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,519
You're crazy.

435
00:30:57,019 --> 00:30:58,790
You're out of your mind.

436
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,790
What? What did you just say?

437
00:31:05,259 --> 00:31:08,830
As of today,
I'm cutting ties with you.

438
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,070
What... You're cutting ties with me?

439
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:18,370
You're not my mother anymore,

440
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:20,009
and I'm not your daughter.

441
00:31:20,909 --> 00:31:23,840
You and me.
We're done being a family.

442
00:31:25,209 --> 00:31:26,610
I'm also going to move out.

443
00:31:29,219 --> 00:31:31,280
What? You're done with me?

444
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,820
You!

445
00:31:35,689 --> 00:31:36,890
Park Do Ra, you.

446
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,929
Nothing can change the fact
that we're mother and daughter.

447
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:44,830
That's why I wasn't able
to abandon you children!

448
00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:48,669
After all I did
to raise you three...

449
00:31:48,669 --> 00:31:50,640
How could you even say that to me?

450
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,669
Others may say that,

451
00:31:52,669 --> 00:31:55,880
but you of all people shouldn't.

452
00:31:58,009 --> 00:32:00,749
I... It...

453
00:32:01,209 --> 00:32:03,780
It wasn't so that
only I could have a good life.

454
00:32:03,979 --> 00:32:07,189
What I did wasn't all for my sake.
Park Do Ra, you...

455
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,259
Park Do Ra.

456
00:32:09,259 --> 00:32:10,820
How dare you?

457
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,489
You can't do this to me.

458
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,009
You can't do this to me.

459
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,370
Not you.

460
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:31,409
After all I did for you?

461
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,590
You can't do this to me.

462
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:42,719
Not when I...

463
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,560
Not you.

464
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,600
You of all people
can't do this to me.

465
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,769
- The grapes are sweet.
- They are.

466
00:32:56,769 --> 00:32:57,870
Have your fill.

467
00:32:59,009 --> 00:33:02,509
Judging by how Pil Seung
is still not home...

468
00:33:02,909 --> 00:33:04,380
tells me he's out on a date again.

469
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,919
Goodness.

470
00:33:11,019 --> 00:33:13,850
Why did you look at me and sigh
right after saying that?

471
00:33:16,489 --> 00:33:19,360
I involuntarily sigh
at the sight of you.

472
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,759
I can't do anything about it.

473
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:22,199
Is it on auto-mode?

474
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,830
Hyun Chul, you call that a joke?

475
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,929
- Yes.
- The fruits are suddenly bitter.

476
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,110
By the way, I'm curious about Do Ra.

477
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,610
Is it true
that she earns six figures...

478
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:35,709
by filming one commercial?

479
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,479
Probably.

480
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,509
Then, she sure is rude.

481
00:33:40,509 --> 00:33:42,019
How can she not come to greet us...

482
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:44,080
when she earns that much money?

483
00:33:44,419 --> 00:33:47,790
She should've come by
with a Korean beef gift set at least.

484
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,620
Mother, what's the matter with you?

485
00:33:51,489 --> 00:33:55,060
What?
It's not like I'm entirely wrong.

486
00:33:55,699 --> 00:33:57,560
Are they married?
Is she their daughter-in-law?

487
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,729
Why should she come by to greet us?

488
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,830
They're only dating for now.

489
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:05,439
Pil Seung won't have to pay
for anything while out on dates.

490
00:34:05,439 --> 00:34:07,509
Not when Do Ra makes
that much money.

491
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:10,179
They say youngsters these days
don't date...

492
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:12,209
because the money they have to spend
is burdening.

493
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,080
Meanwhile, Pil Seung
will be able to save up.

494
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,280
Gosh.

495
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:21,990
I'm home.

496
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,590
- Hey.
- Hey.

497
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,329
Were you out with Do Ra again?

498
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:26,889
We only met briefly.

499
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:29,499
Pil Seung, you must be tired.
Wash up and get some rest.

500
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,530
- You should.
- Right. Good night, then.

501
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:32,800
Sure thing.

502
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,939
Mother, don't say things like that
to Pil Seung.

503
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:42,610
Fine.

504
00:34:42,709 --> 00:34:45,479
Maybe I should sew my lips shut.

505
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:50,249
- Unbelievable.
- Gosh, my back.

506
00:34:50,249 --> 00:34:52,550
Sun Young, don't mind her.

507
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,729
Gosh.

508
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,639
But I can't bear it
on days like this.

509
00:35:12,139 --> 00:35:13,169
You see,

510
00:35:14,539 --> 00:35:19,050
I have had it rough
because of my mom...

511
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,510
who only thinks of me as a machine
that spits money.

512
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,849
Because of my mom,
I wanted to die today.

513
00:35:32,329 --> 00:35:33,329
Do Ra...

514
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,059
She must've had it rough.

515
00:35:40,329 --> 00:35:41,430
Anyway,

516
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:45,010
what kind of photo shoot
did her mom make her do?

517
00:35:52,979 --> 00:35:55,680
Dad, I hate you. I'm disappointed.

518
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,119
How can you not know what I want?

519
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:03,360
Hey, watch out.

520
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,059
Thank you.

521
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,900
Are you all right?

522
00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:17,139
Yes.

523
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:24,610
He's such a gentleman.

524
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,950
What is it? Is something wrong?

525
00:36:31,019 --> 00:36:33,349
No, it's not like that.

526
00:36:35,689 --> 00:36:37,619
Do you perhaps like lemons?

527
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,430
Lemons?

528
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:50,900
Thank you for rescuing
my baby sister Ru Ru.

529
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:57,680
I'll enjoy the lemon candy. Thanks.

530
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:06,349
This is how the characters
from my favorite novel met.

531
00:37:07,689 --> 00:37:08,689
My gosh.

532
00:37:09,419 --> 00:37:11,930
Could we be destined to be together?

533
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:18,130
Ru Ru, what was that?
I should go after him?

534
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:23,200
(Tracks)

535
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,729
You're such an idiot.

536
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,130
You didn't even ask for his name.

537
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,200
Ru Ru, what was that?

538
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,530
If we're destined to be together,
we'll meet again?

539
00:37:56,669 --> 00:37:58,570
Fine. I get what you're saying.

540
00:38:02,598 --> 00:38:05,269
What? You lost track of Ma Ri?

541
00:38:07,138 --> 00:38:10,269
All right. Mr. Kang,
keep looking around the area.

542
00:38:10,308 --> 00:38:11,738
I'll be right there.

543
00:38:12,169 --> 00:38:13,339
Did he lose track of Ma Ri?

544
00:38:13,339 --> 00:38:15,308
What do we do?
She left her phone at home.

545
00:38:16,138 --> 00:38:18,348
I doubt she went far.
She'll still be nearby.

546
00:38:18,348 --> 00:38:19,448
Don't worry too much.

547
00:38:19,948 --> 00:38:21,218
I'll go and help find her.

548
00:38:21,348 --> 00:38:22,348
I'm coming with you.

549
00:38:22,348 --> 00:38:23,819
Mom, Dad.

550
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:27,189
Ma Ri, where were you?

551
00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:30,428
Ma Ri, how could you do this?

552
00:38:30,629 --> 00:38:32,629
You left the house
without Mr. Kang...

553
00:38:32,629 --> 00:38:35,328
and didn't even take your phone.

554
00:38:36,198 --> 00:38:38,169
Do you have any idea
how worried we were?

555
00:38:39,328 --> 00:38:41,598
Dad, set your worries aside.

556
00:38:41,598 --> 00:38:44,408
I finally met the man of my destiny.

557
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:47,778
What? What do you mean by that?

558
00:38:48,539 --> 00:38:50,408
A while ago,
in front of the subway station,

559
00:38:50,408 --> 00:38:54,218
I met the man of my dreams.

560
00:38:55,819 --> 00:38:58,488
But I wasn't able to follow him
and forgot to ask for his name.

561
00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:01,589
What?

562
00:39:01,789 --> 00:39:03,558
Dad, don't worry, though.

563
00:39:03,558 --> 00:39:06,189
I'll find and meet him again.

564
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:11,028
So please don't mention
that old man to me ever again.

565
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,129
Got it, Dad?

566
00:39:19,408 --> 00:39:22,709
Who on earth did she meet
that has her acting this way?

567
00:39:23,348 --> 00:39:26,149
Honey, let's not rush things.

568
00:39:26,848 --> 00:39:29,379
It's too soon
to force Ma Ri into anything.

569
00:39:31,689 --> 00:39:33,049
But Mr. Yang's son...

570
00:39:33,859 --> 00:39:35,459
is a decent guy.

571
00:39:43,828 --> 00:39:45,328
Do Ra, are you going on vacation?

572
00:39:46,569 --> 00:39:48,638
Do Sik, I'm moving out.

573
00:39:49,169 --> 00:39:50,908
I'm cutting ties with Mom,
so know that.

574
00:39:51,368 --> 00:39:53,439
What do you mean
you're cutting ties with her?

575
00:39:53,439 --> 00:39:54,508
Have you lost it?

576
00:39:54,709 --> 00:39:56,879
Come on back in. Let's talk.

577
00:39:58,709 --> 00:40:00,519
Let go of me!

578
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:02,149
Do Ra.

579
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:04,649
Please don't do this, Do Ra.

580
00:40:04,649 --> 00:40:05,848
Let go of me.

581
00:40:06,289 --> 00:40:07,959
I don't even want to hear your voice.

582
00:40:08,459 --> 00:40:11,589
Do Ra, I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking straight.

583
00:40:11,789 --> 00:40:12,928
Do Ra,

584
00:40:13,089 --> 00:40:15,928
it's tough being an actress
and things are always unstable.

585
00:40:15,928 --> 00:40:18,129
You never know
when you'll be yesterday's news.

586
00:40:18,129 --> 00:40:19,968
Also, you can't be
a top celebrity forever.

587
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,598
If you meet a decent man,

588
00:40:21,598 --> 00:40:23,069
I thought you could...

589
00:40:23,069 --> 00:40:25,609
only star in projects you wanted to
without worrying about money.

590
00:40:25,609 --> 00:40:27,308
That's why
I set you up with Mr. Gong.

591
00:40:27,308 --> 00:40:28,638
It was all for your sake.

592
00:40:28,638 --> 00:40:31,308
But now that I think about it,

593
00:40:31,308 --> 00:40:33,078
I was wrong to force this.

594
00:40:33,078 --> 00:40:35,078
I should've asked
how you felt about it.

595
00:40:35,278 --> 00:40:36,379
I'm sorry.

596
00:40:36,379 --> 00:40:37,888
I'm sorry,
and I won't do this again.

597
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,348
I'm sorry. Please.

598
00:40:39,649 --> 00:40:40,718
Stop it.

599
00:40:41,058 --> 00:40:43,218
I don't want to hear it anymore.

600
00:40:43,289 --> 00:40:44,359
Park Do Ra!

601
00:40:45,388 --> 00:40:46,658
You're being unreasonable.

602
00:40:47,299 --> 00:40:49,528
It wasn't wrong of Mom
to set you up with Mr. Gong.

603
00:40:49,528 --> 00:40:50,899
Don't date the guy
if you don't want to!

604
00:40:51,569 --> 00:40:53,439
But saying you'll cut ties with Mom?

605
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:55,638
How could you say that
when we're family?

606
00:40:55,638 --> 00:40:57,008
We're no longer a family.

607
00:40:58,109 --> 00:41:00,039
Real mothers
don't sell their children to others.

608
00:41:01,109 --> 00:41:02,379
"Sell their children?"

609
00:41:02,808 --> 00:41:04,308
How dare you spit such words?

610
00:41:06,479 --> 00:41:07,519
That brat.

611
00:41:09,249 --> 00:41:10,388
- Are you all right?
- Excuse me.

612
00:41:10,388 --> 00:41:11,488
Who...

613
00:41:12,089 --> 00:41:13,189
Who are you people?

614
00:41:13,459 --> 00:41:15,558
Who are you to barge into our house?

615
00:41:15,558 --> 00:41:17,229
Does Ms. Baek Mi Ja live here?

616
00:41:17,488 --> 00:41:19,488
She does, but who are you people?

617
00:41:19,828 --> 00:41:20,999
We have a court order.

618
00:41:21,899 --> 00:41:23,968
As we'll be carrying out
a seizure order...

619
00:41:24,129 --> 00:41:26,698
regarding debtor Baek Mi Ja's
accounts and tangible assets,

620
00:41:26,698 --> 00:41:27,868
we ask for your cooperation.

621
00:41:28,238 --> 00:41:30,039
- Carry it out.
- Yes, sir.

622
00:41:30,109 --> 00:41:33,109
- Wait. Hold on a second.
- Here.

623
00:41:34,008 --> 00:41:35,939
A seizure order?
What do you mean by that?

624
00:41:36,138 --> 00:41:38,379
Are you sure
you have the right person?

625
00:41:38,549 --> 00:41:39,808
You confirmed
that Baek Mi Ja lived here.

626
00:41:39,808 --> 00:41:41,078
That's true, but...

627
00:41:41,078 --> 00:41:42,348
Mom, what's going on?

628
00:41:42,348 --> 00:41:44,218
Why are they carrying out
a seizure order?

629
00:41:44,789 --> 00:41:45,789
Mom,

630
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:48,589
was there a debt I wasn't aware of?

631
00:41:49,388 --> 00:41:50,589
How much do you owe...

632
00:41:50,589 --> 00:41:52,189
for them to carry out
a seizure order?

633
00:41:54,629 --> 00:41:57,729
My gosh. What do I do?

634
00:41:58,968 --> 00:41:59,968
Wait.

635
00:41:59,968 --> 00:42:02,098
- Let us check a few things.
- Hold on a second.

636
00:42:02,138 --> 00:42:04,669
No. You seem to have
the wrong person.

637
00:42:05,769 --> 00:42:07,339
Hold on.

638
00:42:08,138 --> 00:42:09,209
Oh, no.

639
00:42:11,749 --> 00:42:12,778
What did you just say?

640
00:42:14,118 --> 00:42:16,649
She put 90 percent of the house
and our building on a loan?

641
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:20,218
Yes, and a credit loan
of three million dollars...

642
00:42:20,218 --> 00:42:21,589
was taken out in the agency's name.

643
00:42:21,589 --> 00:42:22,758
Three million dollars?

644
00:42:28,299 --> 00:42:30,999
There's money in my account.
I'll pay off the debt with it.

645
00:42:31,499 --> 00:42:33,569
It's already being overdrawn.

646
00:42:34,169 --> 00:42:35,269
Weren't you aware of it?

647
00:42:36,138 --> 00:42:38,669
There's an overdraft
of 300,000 dollars.

648
00:42:39,669 --> 00:42:40,678
What?

649
00:42:44,149 --> 00:42:45,379
Are you saying...

650
00:42:47,749 --> 00:42:49,479
my account is empty...

651
00:42:51,249 --> 00:42:54,189
and the building and apartment
are on collateral?

652
00:42:55,959 --> 00:42:57,859
And I owe 3.3 million dollars?

653
00:42:58,459 --> 00:43:01,428
Yes. We sent multiple notices
that we'd seize your assets.

654
00:43:01,428 --> 00:43:02,528
You didn't know?

655
00:43:03,328 --> 00:43:05,629
Everything will go up for auction.

656
00:43:17,649 --> 00:43:20,649
Miss. Are you all right?

657
00:43:31,028 --> 00:43:33,189
Do Sik. She's waking up.

658
00:43:36,428 --> 00:43:37,928
It's me, Jae Dong.

659
00:43:39,428 --> 00:43:40,468
Are you okay, Do Ra?

660
00:43:41,238 --> 00:43:43,238
You fainted at the bank.

661
00:43:43,669 --> 00:43:44,709
Do you remember that?

662
00:43:46,008 --> 00:43:47,109
Do Sik.

663
00:43:50,448 --> 00:43:53,178
Our building and apartment.

664
00:43:54,948 --> 00:43:56,948
Most of it is debt.

665
00:43:58,549 --> 00:44:00,158
But there's more debt.

666
00:44:03,258 --> 00:44:04,729
It's not true, is it?

667
00:44:06,028 --> 00:44:07,698
This isn't reality, right?

668
00:44:08,399 --> 00:44:09,598
Is it a dream?

669
00:44:11,799 --> 00:44:13,799
Please say it's a dream.

670
00:44:15,769 --> 00:44:16,808
Do Ra.

671
00:44:19,508 --> 00:44:21,508
I want it to be a dream too.

672
00:44:22,908 --> 00:44:24,348
But Mom gambled.

673
00:44:25,278 --> 00:44:27,118
What? She gambled?

674
00:44:31,749 --> 00:44:32,888
What did she do?

675
00:44:32,888 --> 00:44:34,058
Do Ra. Do Sik.

676
00:44:34,459 --> 00:44:36,519
Social media's going crazy
about your debt.

677
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:38,058
What should we do?

678
00:44:40,452 --> 00:44:41,852
(She makes a lot. She'll be fine.)

679
00:44:41,852 --> 00:44:43,052
(Her mom's her agent.
How could she not know?)

680
00:44:43,052 --> 00:44:44,112
(Her mom spent the money, not her.)

681
00:44:44,495 --> 00:44:46,595
What's all this?

682
00:44:48,006 --> 00:44:49,165
Is this about me?

683
00:44:52,935 --> 00:44:55,245
Articles and comments about her
are coming up like crazy.

684
00:44:55,645 --> 00:44:57,316
They think the initials mean her.

685
00:44:57,316 --> 00:44:58,546
What should we do?

686
00:44:58,645 --> 00:45:00,145
Where's Mom?

687
00:45:01,515 --> 00:45:02,915
Where is Mom?

688
00:45:03,245 --> 00:45:04,716
Do Ra.

689
00:45:05,316 --> 00:45:06,656
Hey. Do Ra!

690
00:45:06,656 --> 00:45:08,986
("Star Park Do Ra Criticized for Not
Repaying Mother’s Gambling Debt")

691
00:45:08,986 --> 00:45:10,204
(Park stood as guarantor...)

692
00:45:13,011 --> 00:45:14,721
What will happen to poor Do Ra?

693
00:45:15,982 --> 00:45:17,982
My poor girl...

694
00:45:29,462 --> 00:45:32,431
Mom. What happened?

695
00:45:33,072 --> 00:45:35,172
What on earth did you get up to?

696
00:45:36,042 --> 00:45:37,471
Did you really gamble?

697
00:45:38,112 --> 00:45:40,011
What's all the news about?
Is it true?

698
00:45:40,882 --> 00:45:42,212
Do Ra.

699
00:45:43,312 --> 00:45:44,551
Explain it to me, Mom.

700
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:49,922
How...
How on earth could this happen?

701
00:45:50,491 --> 00:45:52,752
How must you gamble
for this to happen?

702
00:45:53,051 --> 00:45:54,621
I want an explanation!

703
00:45:55,322 --> 00:45:56,422
Well,

704
00:45:56,761 --> 00:45:59,292
I did gamble,
but it's not all gambling debt.

705
00:45:59,531 --> 00:46:02,201
I invested in something
hoping it would be profitable,

706
00:46:02,562 --> 00:46:04,572
but that investment was a con.

707
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:07,101
I gambled to make up for that loss,

708
00:46:07,101 --> 00:46:09,301
but I kept losing at the table,

709
00:46:09,301 --> 00:46:11,272
so I gambled more to win it back.

710
00:46:11,272 --> 00:46:14,982
But I didn't want you to worry,

711
00:46:14,982 --> 00:46:17,411
so I borrowed from people
to hide it from you.

712
00:46:17,411 --> 00:46:19,712
So that's what happened.

713
00:46:21,081 --> 00:46:22,181
Mom.

714
00:46:23,891 --> 00:46:27,661
You know the kind of life I had.

715
00:46:28,621 --> 00:46:30,862
You know what it was like for me.

716
00:46:33,232 --> 00:46:35,362
I did everything you said.

717
00:46:37,232 --> 00:46:40,402
I worked like
a money-making machine.

718
00:46:40,641 --> 00:46:42,772
You know that better than anyone.

719
00:46:43,402 --> 00:46:46,612
How could you of all people
do this to me?

720
00:46:47,482 --> 00:46:50,212
How could you, Mom?

721
00:46:50,911 --> 00:46:51,951
Do Ra.

722
00:46:53,382 --> 00:46:56,422
Do Ra. I didn't know
it would come to this.

723
00:46:56,752 --> 00:46:58,351
I didn't know.

724
00:46:58,652 --> 00:47:00,152
Do Ra.

725
00:47:00,292 --> 00:47:02,391
You worked so hard for years,

726
00:47:02,391 --> 00:47:05,192
and we can't lose
all that you worked for.

727
00:47:05,192 --> 00:47:07,761
So Do Ra.

728
00:47:08,661 --> 00:47:12,201
Say you'll date Mr. Gong.

729
00:47:14,241 --> 00:47:15,241
What?

730
00:47:16,402 --> 00:47:17,411
Let's go.

731
00:47:18,342 --> 00:47:20,612
Let's go see Mr. Gong.

732
00:47:21,081 --> 00:47:23,712
If you just say you'll date him,

733
00:47:24,382 --> 00:47:26,212
he'll sort it all out for you.

734
00:47:26,312 --> 00:47:28,252
He'll have all the articles
taken down,

735
00:47:28,621 --> 00:47:31,292
and he'll cover all our debts too.

736
00:47:31,422 --> 00:47:34,721
So Do Ra. Please!

737
00:47:34,721 --> 00:47:37,962
You gambled us into debt,

738
00:47:37,962 --> 00:47:40,161
and now you want to sell me too?

739
00:47:41,161 --> 00:47:44,902
How could a mom do this?

740
00:47:47,101 --> 00:47:50,411
Do Ra!

741
00:47:51,011 --> 00:47:52,712
What should we do?

742
00:47:54,112 --> 00:47:55,781
What now, Do Ra?

743
00:47:56,411 --> 00:47:57,911
She's here.

744
00:47:57,911 --> 00:48:00,351
Who are you? How dare you come in?

745
00:48:00,781 --> 00:48:01,822
Park Do Ra.

746
00:48:01,822 --> 00:48:03,522
- Here she is.
- I'm glad we met.

747
00:48:04,252 --> 00:48:06,252
What's all this?
The bank got here first.

748
00:48:06,451 --> 00:48:08,022
Look at all the red stickers.

749
00:48:08,062 --> 00:48:09,592
- Shoot.
- What's all this?

750
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:11,161
Did they lose everything?

751
00:48:11,862 --> 00:48:14,201
You! I want my money right now.

752
00:48:14,201 --> 00:48:16,732
Forget your mom.
I want you to pay me back.

753
00:48:17,072 --> 00:48:18,471
This is a promissory note...

754
00:48:18,471 --> 00:48:20,801
your mom signed
when she borrowed 500,000 dollars.

755
00:48:20,942 --> 00:48:24,241
See here? It's your seal
saying you vouch for her.

756
00:48:24,312 --> 00:48:26,141
I lent her the money
because you were famous,

757
00:48:26,141 --> 00:48:27,681
not because I trusted your mom.

758
00:48:27,882 --> 00:48:29,842
Pay me back right now!

759
00:48:29,942 --> 00:48:31,152
You owe me 300,000 dollars!

760
00:48:31,551 --> 00:48:33,712
I won't leave until I have my money.

761
00:48:34,152 --> 00:48:35,752
I have a promissory note too.

762
00:48:35,882 --> 00:48:38,092
When will you give me
my 200,000 dollars?

763
00:48:40,922 --> 00:48:44,261
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

764
00:48:45,661 --> 00:48:47,101
I don't know anything.

765
00:48:47,261 --> 00:48:49,261
What? You don't know anything?

766
00:48:49,331 --> 00:48:52,331
How dare you say that
when you took my money?

767
00:48:52,331 --> 00:48:54,902
- Will you stop it?
- That money.

768
00:48:54,902 --> 00:48:57,312
It's my hard-earned cash, you fraud!

769
00:48:57,312 --> 00:48:59,971
- Leave her alone.
- You need to be taught a lesson.

770
00:48:59,971 --> 00:49:02,112
- If your mom can't pay, you should.
- Give me my money!

771
00:49:02,112 --> 00:49:04,312
You can't get out of it
by saying you had no idea!

772
00:49:04,312 --> 00:49:06,382
- Stop!
- My gosh.

773
00:49:06,382 --> 00:49:08,822
Stay away from my daughter!

774
00:49:08,822 --> 00:49:10,081
Do Ra doesn't know anything!

775
00:49:10,081 --> 00:49:11,951
- She doesn't know?
- As if she doesn't know.

776
00:49:12,551 --> 00:49:14,522
- Where's my money?
- You owe me!

777
00:49:14,522 --> 00:49:16,862
- Pay me back!
- What did you do with it?

778
00:49:16,862 --> 00:49:18,891
Stop it, all of you! Stop!

779
00:49:18,891 --> 00:49:19,931
What?

780
00:49:21,261 --> 00:49:22,962
I'll pay you all back.

781
00:49:36,681 --> 00:49:37,882
I'm sorry.

782
00:49:39,511 --> 00:49:42,621
I found out only today
that my mom put us all in debt.

783
00:49:44,621 --> 00:49:47,192
I'll pay you all back somehow.

784
00:49:48,391 --> 00:49:49,562
So please stop.

785
00:49:51,132 --> 00:49:53,062
Trust me
and give me a little more time.

786
00:49:54,362 --> 00:49:55,732
Somehow,

787
00:49:56,661 --> 00:49:59,902
even if it takes years,
I'll pay you back.

788
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:04,871
Please stop.

789
00:50:07,641 --> 00:50:09,511
I'll pay you back.

790
00:50:10,612 --> 00:50:11,752
I'm sorry.

791
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:14,181
I'm sorry.

792
00:50:15,851 --> 00:50:17,051
I'm sorry.

793
00:50:19,152 --> 00:50:20,292
I'm sorry.

794
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:24,132
Darn it.

795
00:50:24,531 --> 00:50:25,792
I'm sorry.

796
00:50:26,062 --> 00:50:27,092
Goodness.

797
00:50:32,471 --> 00:50:33,502
Mr. Gong.

798
00:50:34,141 --> 00:50:35,942
My Do Ra passed out.

799
00:50:36,342 --> 00:50:37,942
Please help her.

800
00:50:38,272 --> 00:50:40,411
She's at death's door.

801
00:50:40,911 --> 00:50:42,411
Mr. Gong. Please.

802
00:50:43,281 --> 00:50:44,612
Do you know...

803
00:50:45,382 --> 00:50:47,422
what she did to me
at the vacation home?

804
00:50:48,882 --> 00:50:50,752
You turned me into
a loser and a freak,

805
00:50:51,752 --> 00:50:52,922
and now you grovel?

806
00:50:54,062 --> 00:50:55,522
If she needs my help,

807
00:50:56,092 --> 00:50:58,692
she can come to me
and kneel and beg.

808
00:50:58,692 --> 00:50:59,931
- But...
- Mr. Cho.

809
00:51:00,902 --> 00:51:01,962
Take her out of here.

810
00:51:01,962 --> 00:51:03,232
It's not like that.

811
00:51:03,632 --> 00:51:05,002
Hear me out, Mr. Gong.

812
00:51:05,002 --> 00:51:06,331
- Let go!
- You must leave.

813
00:51:06,331 --> 00:51:10,002
Will you hear me out, Mr. Gong?

814
00:51:10,201 --> 00:51:11,411
I'm sorry.

815
00:51:11,871 --> 00:51:14,842
It's all on me, Mr. Gong.

816
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:17,612
Hey, Pil Seung.

817
00:51:18,812 --> 00:51:20,351
What is it? Is something wrong?

818
00:51:20,351 --> 00:51:21,681
Didn't you see this?

819
00:51:21,922 --> 00:51:24,022
They're saying Park Do Ra's mom
hasn't paid back her debt.

820
00:51:25,252 --> 00:51:27,692
What? What debt?

821
00:51:27,761 --> 00:51:30,292
What on earth is going on?

822
00:51:30,792 --> 00:51:33,031
I'm glad "Straightforward Romance"
ended last week.

823
00:51:33,261 --> 00:51:34,701
If this had gotten out
while it was airing,

824
00:51:35,031 --> 00:51:36,862
it could've been bad for us.

825
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:39,801
My ancestors did me a huge favor.

826
00:51:40,132 --> 00:51:41,371
Merciful Buddha...

827
00:51:42,601 --> 00:51:43,641
Jin Gu.

828
00:51:45,442 --> 00:51:46,712
Is this all true?

829
00:51:46,911 --> 00:51:48,281
How would I know?

830
00:51:48,411 --> 00:51:51,081
But it must be true
if articles keep pouring out.

831
00:51:51,351 --> 00:51:54,922
What kind of woman is Do Ra's mom?

832
00:51:55,152 --> 00:51:57,522
Why would she even gamble?

833
00:51:57,692 --> 00:51:59,752
How could she
gamble everything away?

834
00:51:59,752 --> 00:52:02,062
Do Ra must've made so much so far.

835
00:52:02,462 --> 00:52:04,761
Hey. What's up with him?

836
00:52:05,362 --> 00:52:07,831
Do Ra. I just read the article.

837
00:52:08,862 --> 00:52:09,962
Are you okay?

838
00:52:10,331 --> 00:52:11,471
Where are you?

839
00:52:29,621 --> 00:52:30,692
Do Ra.

840
00:52:32,822 --> 00:52:34,121
You can't let yourself get weak.

841
00:52:35,661 --> 00:52:36,962
At times like this,

842
00:52:38,232 --> 00:52:39,862
you must be even stronger.

843
00:52:40,362 --> 00:52:41,362
Okay?

844
00:52:44,502 --> 00:52:45,732
Sure.

845
00:52:47,502 --> 00:52:49,002
Don't worry about me.

846
00:52:49,741 --> 00:52:51,112
I can get through this.

847
00:52:52,672 --> 00:52:55,042
You have no idea how strong I am.

848
00:52:56,141 --> 00:52:58,181
I've been through so much
since I was 12...

849
00:52:58,181 --> 00:52:59,812
just to survive in this field.

850
00:53:03,982 --> 00:53:05,551
I will start afresh.

851
00:53:06,422 --> 00:53:08,621
And I will pay off the debt.

852
00:53:09,822 --> 00:53:11,331
I won't cave in just like this.

853
00:53:12,462 --> 00:53:13,592
Okay, Do Ra.

854
00:53:14,431 --> 00:53:15,661
You can do this.

855
00:53:16,232 --> 00:53:17,402
You can get over it.

856
00:53:18,502 --> 00:53:19,871
I know what you are made of.

857
00:53:20,301 --> 00:53:21,301
Sure.

858
00:53:22,072 --> 00:53:23,871
So you shouldn't worry about me.

859
00:53:24,741 --> 00:53:26,042
I will do whatever I can to help you.

860
00:53:27,842 --> 00:53:30,212
We can overcome this together.

861
00:53:32,752 --> 00:53:33,812
Do Ra.

862
00:53:35,652 --> 00:53:37,422
Don't let yourself get discouraged.

863
00:53:37,951 --> 00:53:38,951
Okay?

864
00:53:39,351 --> 00:53:40,491
Of course not.

865
00:53:41,891 --> 00:53:43,322
I have you by my side.

866
00:53:44,862 --> 00:53:46,192
I can do this.

867
00:53:54,801 --> 00:53:55,801
Pil Seung.

868
00:53:58,712 --> 00:54:01,042
No matter what happens to me,

869
00:54:03,042 --> 00:54:04,951
will you be by my side?

870
00:54:06,612 --> 00:54:07,621
Of course.

871
00:54:08,922 --> 00:54:11,822
I will always be by your side.

872
00:54:13,022 --> 00:54:14,391
I'm not going anywhere.

873
00:54:16,721 --> 00:54:17,831
So, Do Ra,

874
00:54:20,331 --> 00:54:21,362
just hang in there.

875
00:54:23,132 --> 00:54:24,172
Okay.

876
00:54:27,201 --> 00:54:28,201
Thanks.

877
00:54:31,141 --> 00:54:32,272
Thank you, Pil Seung.

878
00:54:50,192 --> 00:54:53,062
Do Sik, stop frowning like that.

879
00:54:53,232 --> 00:54:54,632
I'm not caving in.

880
00:54:55,161 --> 00:54:57,002
I'm Park Do Ra, you know.

881
00:54:57,402 --> 00:54:59,971
You know how we used
to run away from creditors...

882
00:54:59,971 --> 00:55:01,842
at night because of Mom.

883
00:55:02,601 --> 00:55:04,542
I've been through
much worse than this.

884
00:55:04,542 --> 00:55:05,712
This is no big deal.

885
00:55:06,172 --> 00:55:08,911
So make sure to take
any offers that come along.

886
00:55:10,681 --> 00:55:11,681
Do Ra.

887
00:55:12,152 --> 00:55:14,252
Those commercials
have already been canceled.

888
00:55:15,721 --> 00:55:16,752
What?

889
00:55:17,252 --> 00:55:18,351
Do Ra.

890
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:21,621
This isn't
just about new commercials.

891
00:55:23,022 --> 00:55:24,632
We need to pay penalties.

892
00:55:27,132 --> 00:55:28,462
Penalties?

893
00:55:30,002 --> 00:55:31,132
How much would that be?

894
00:55:31,402 --> 00:55:33,232
I did some math.

895
00:55:35,002 --> 00:55:36,442
And it's about ten million dollars.

896
00:55:38,312 --> 00:55:39,342
What?

897
00:55:41,741 --> 00:55:42,812
Ten million dollars?

898
00:55:49,522 --> 00:55:51,721
- Do Ra, are you all right?
- Hey, Do Ra.

899
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:17,411
You didn't have to go to the office
so early in the morning.

900
00:56:18,351 --> 00:56:19,482
Drink this.

901
00:56:19,482 --> 00:56:21,482
You should eat something
to get your energy back up.

902
00:56:22,422 --> 00:56:23,451
Get out.

903
00:56:25,092 --> 00:56:28,621
Do Ra, we got an offer
for a new project.

904
00:56:29,292 --> 00:56:32,362
If you take it, they can give us
two million dollars.

905
00:56:36,531 --> 00:56:37,871
With that money,

906
00:56:38,502 --> 00:56:39,632
we can pay the interest.

907
00:56:39,632 --> 00:56:43,942
And we can buy some time
to keep this house and the building.

908
00:56:49,681 --> 00:56:50,681
What is it?

909
00:56:52,712 --> 00:56:54,851
It includes a nude shoot.

910
00:56:57,451 --> 00:57:00,351
What? A nude shoot?

911
00:57:02,922 --> 00:57:03,962
Mom.

912
00:57:05,232 --> 00:57:07,491
How could you push me that far?

913
00:57:10,601 --> 00:57:11,672
Do Ra.

914
00:57:13,101 --> 00:57:15,942
A nude shoot isn't something bad.

915
00:57:16,701 --> 00:57:17,971
You should do it...

916
00:57:17,971 --> 00:57:20,712
when you're still young and pretty.

917
00:57:21,641 --> 00:57:24,112
They will make you look like...

918
00:57:24,112 --> 00:57:25,851
a beautiful work of art.

919
00:57:25,851 --> 00:57:28,681
It's a work of art.

920
00:57:29,551 --> 00:57:32,121
You've worked so hard
to buy this house and the building.

921
00:57:32,121 --> 00:57:34,621
You can't give up on them
just like this.

922
00:57:34,621 --> 00:57:35,661
Do Ra.

923
00:57:54,042 --> 00:57:55,042
Do Ra,

924
00:57:56,042 --> 00:57:57,442
why aren't you calling me?

925
00:57:58,181 --> 00:57:59,312
Are you all right?

926
00:57:59,312 --> 00:58:00,975
(Do Ra, why aren't you calling me?
Are you all right?)

927
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:07,036
(Do Ra, why aren't you calling me?
Are you all right?)

928
00:58:11,386 --> 00:58:12,485
Pil Seung.

929
00:58:15,224 --> 00:58:18,494
I can't believe
Park Do Ra ended up so miserable.

930
00:58:21,434 --> 00:58:23,034
Why would you say that?

931
00:58:23,034 --> 00:58:25,235
She's not in her right mind now.

932
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:26,574
She's doing a nude shoot.

933
00:58:33,275 --> 00:58:35,014
What are you talking about?

934
00:58:36,844 --> 00:58:38,554
Where did you hear that nonsense?

935
00:58:39,454 --> 00:58:41,724
Who on earth said
something ridiculous like that?

936
00:58:41,954 --> 00:58:44,284
Mr. Cha Il Dae's friend
is the photographer.

937
00:58:44,925 --> 00:58:46,224
Foreign investors...

938
00:58:46,224 --> 00:58:48,425
put a huge amount of money
into Park Do Ra's nude shoot.

939
00:58:48,425 --> 00:58:49,695
The schedule has been
finalized today.

940
00:58:49,695 --> 00:58:50,795
So it must be true.

941
00:58:51,965 --> 00:58:52,994
What...

942
00:58:55,005 --> 00:58:56,005
Today?

943
00:58:56,164 --> 00:58:57,164
Yes.

944
00:58:59,934 --> 00:59:03,675
How could the romance queen
be ruined so suddenly like that?

945
00:59:05,574 --> 00:59:08,545
There's nothing I can do
when I have to watch...

946
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,114
the female lead of my drama go down.

947
00:59:10,114 --> 00:59:11,684
It just breaks my heart.

948
00:59:12,815 --> 00:59:14,114
It's killing me.

949
00:59:47,307 --> 00:59:49,755
(Curly-haired Assistant Director)

950
01:00:05,034 --> 01:00:06,804
Pil Seung, I'm working now.

951
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:09,304
I'll call you back later.

952
01:00:09,574 --> 01:00:12,574
Do Ra, where are you now?
Tell me where you are.

953
01:00:13,914 --> 01:00:16,614
Why do you want to know
where I'm working?

954
01:00:16,744 --> 01:00:18,315
Just tell me now!

955
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:20,684
Why can't you tell me?

956
01:00:22,855 --> 01:00:23,985
Do Ra.

957
01:00:24,855 --> 01:00:26,554
Is it true that you're doing
the nude shoot today?

958
01:00:35,505 --> 01:00:36,505
Pil Seung.

959
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:39,905
I'm in the middle of work.

960
01:00:41,074 --> 01:00:42,445
I'll call you later.

961
01:01:08,704 --> 01:01:11,574
Let go of me, Pil Seung.
Why are you being like this?

962
01:01:13,034 --> 01:01:14,235
Do you not know why?

963
01:01:14,775 --> 01:01:16,204
You shouldn't be here.

964
01:01:17,175 --> 01:01:18,315
Let's go, Do Ra.

965
01:01:20,215 --> 01:01:23,244
You can't be doing this here.

966
01:01:24,614 --> 01:01:26,054
This is where I work.

967
01:01:28,224 --> 01:01:29,284
Do Ra.

968
01:01:30,155 --> 01:01:31,355
You told me...

969
01:01:32,195 --> 01:01:33,554
that you'd start afresh.

970
01:01:34,255 --> 01:01:35,795
That you would work hard again.

971
01:01:35,795 --> 01:01:37,494
So is this the start
you were talking about?

972
01:01:37,494 --> 01:01:39,065
What's wrong with this?

973
01:01:39,795 --> 01:01:41,735
This is something
only people like me can do.

974
01:01:42,764 --> 01:01:45,474
And do you not know
the situation I'm in now?

975
01:01:49,505 --> 01:01:51,514
So does that mean
you're doing this...

976
01:01:52,844 --> 01:01:53,875
for money?

977
01:01:53,875 --> 01:01:56,215
Of course, it's for money!

978
01:01:57,644 --> 01:01:59,114
Are you asking
because you really don't know?

979
01:02:02,454 --> 01:02:03,525
Do Ra.

980
01:02:03,885 --> 01:02:05,655
How could you do something like this
just for money?

981
01:02:06,494 --> 01:02:08,465
You have to find another way
to get through this.

982
01:02:10,764 --> 01:02:12,335
I don't want you
to regret this later.

983
01:02:14,664 --> 01:02:15,664
Do Ra.

984
01:02:16,735 --> 01:02:18,105
I know what you're going through.

985
01:02:19,974 --> 01:02:21,804
But I don't want you to do this.

986
01:02:24,244 --> 01:02:25,244
Pil Seung.

987
01:02:27,144 --> 01:02:28,644
I'm getting two million dollars
for this.

988
01:02:30,045 --> 01:02:31,355
Do you have that kind of money?

989
01:02:34,954 --> 01:02:35,954
What?

990
01:02:36,025 --> 01:02:38,425
I can make two million dollars
after a few hours of a photo shoot.

991
01:02:38,824 --> 01:02:40,554
Can you give me that money instead?

992
01:02:42,724 --> 01:02:44,494
The mistake will be mine to regret,

993
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:46,994
so shut it and get lost
unless you have two million dollars!

994
01:03:42,655 --> 01:03:43,684
Just a second.

995
01:03:46,795 --> 01:03:49,465
Pil Seung. I'm getting
two million dollars for this.

996
01:03:50,894 --> 01:03:52,195
Do you have that kind of money?

997
01:03:52,394 --> 01:03:53,864
Can you give me that money instead?

998
01:03:54,434 --> 01:03:56,135
The mistake will be mine to regret,

999
01:03:56,235 --> 01:03:58,775
so shut it and get lost
unless you have two million dollars!

1000
01:04:04,505 --> 01:04:06,344
We'll begin filming now.

1001
01:04:11,454 --> 01:04:12,454
All right.

1002
01:04:20,155 --> 01:04:23,494
Ms. Park, let's get started.
Please take off your robe.

1003
01:05:09,206 --> 01:05:12,146
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1004
01:05:44,405 --> 01:05:47,675
I should've chosen a profession
that earned me a fortune.

1005
01:05:47,675 --> 01:05:49,615
It's something I regret today.

1006
01:05:49,615 --> 01:05:51,416
I bet she finally learned her place.

1007
01:05:51,586 --> 01:05:53,186
She's nothing.

1008
01:05:53,246 --> 01:05:56,385
Pil Seung, I lied
about having feelings for you.

1009
01:05:56,586 --> 01:05:57,856
It was all a lie.

1010
01:05:58,456 --> 01:06:00,626
I played around with you
out of boredom,

1011
01:06:01,356 --> 01:06:03,226
so forget about this cruel witch.

1012
01:06:05,595 --> 01:06:06,695
I wish you happiness, Pil Seung.

1013
01:06:08,566 --> 01:06:10,566
