00:00:00,104 --> 00:00:07,448
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:08,143 --> 00:00:09,719
You two know...

3
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,112
(Episode 46)

4
00:00:11,112 --> 00:00:13,053
how much pain I was in...

5
00:00:14,753 --> 00:00:16,483
after Do Ra died.

6
00:00:18,323 --> 00:00:19,653
But then,

7
00:00:20,452 --> 00:00:22,293
Do Ra came back to me.

8
00:00:23,992 --> 00:00:25,432
Mom,

9
00:00:26,562 --> 00:00:28,862
how can you ask me
to abandon her again?

10
00:00:30,562 --> 00:00:31,972
Do Ra is...

11
00:00:32,672 --> 00:00:34,702
on the edge of a cliff again,

12
00:00:35,803 --> 00:00:37,743
but you're telling me
to abandon her.

13
00:00:40,672 --> 00:00:41,982
Mom.

14
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:44,112
Dad.

15
00:00:44,882 --> 00:00:46,853
Is that what you truly want?

16
00:00:48,623 --> 00:00:52,323
Do you want me
to regret it my whole life...

17
00:00:53,193 --> 00:00:56,222
and live in agony?

18
00:01:05,602 --> 00:01:08,502
No, Pil Seung.

19
00:01:08,843 --> 00:01:11,572
We don't want
to see you heartbroken.

20
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,573
We don't want you to be in agony.

21
00:01:13,742 --> 00:01:15,312
We're sorry.

22
00:01:15,682 --> 00:01:18,512
To be honest,
I didn't like her either.

23
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:19,553
I hated her...

24
00:01:19,553 --> 00:01:22,083
because it seemed like
she was ruining your life...

25
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:23,952
and causing you pain.

26
00:01:24,223 --> 00:01:27,652
But I don't feel
the same way anymore.

27
00:01:28,462 --> 00:01:33,062
I didn’t realize
how deep your love for her was.

28
00:01:34,033 --> 00:01:36,833
I’m sorry I didn’t understand that.

29
00:01:43,542 --> 00:01:45,913
Things are tough for us as is.

30
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:49,542
But if you, Dad,

31
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:52,812
and the rest of the family
also give us a hard time,

32
00:01:54,453 --> 00:01:55,783
we'll have no way out of this.

33
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,282
Then, what?

34
00:01:57,723 --> 00:02:00,229
You're throwing yourself
into the fire.

35
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,993
As your parents, how could we
just sit back and do nothing?

36
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:08,303
Let me make this clear to you.

37
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:11,232
No matter what happens,

38
00:02:12,673 --> 00:02:14,633
I will stay by Do Ra's side.

39
00:02:16,942 --> 00:02:18,272
Didn't you...

40
00:02:18,643 --> 00:02:21,783
read all the articles about her?

41
00:02:22,282 --> 00:02:24,783
There are disgusting rumors
going around about her.

42
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,553
People are calling her
the greatest con artist...

43
00:02:26,553 --> 00:02:28,222
for changing her face
and conning everyone.

44
00:02:28,222 --> 00:02:31,329
At this rate, they'll soon start
calling you a con man too!

45
00:02:31,353 --> 00:02:33,522
So, how could I sit by idly?

46
00:02:35,492 --> 00:02:37,593
Let me say this again.

47
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:40,832
The things people are saying now...

48
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:42,938
are not true.

49
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:45,272
So, trust Do Ra and me
just this once...

50
00:02:45,603 --> 00:02:47,232
and be patient.

51
00:02:48,103 --> 00:02:50,642
All the controversies
and false rumors.

52
00:02:51,643 --> 00:02:53,212
I will be sure to prove them wrong.

53
00:02:54,412 --> 00:02:55,813
Mom.

54
00:02:56,912 --> 00:02:58,242
Dad.

55
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:01,253
Please trust us.

56
00:03:07,323 --> 00:03:08,762
My goodness.

57
00:03:14,803 --> 00:03:18,033
I have to say, Pil Seung is so cool.

58
00:03:18,303 --> 00:03:20,032
Any coward...

59
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:22,279
would've run away long ago
to survive alone.

60
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:24,002
But Pil Seung is even cooler...

61
00:03:24,002 --> 00:03:27,473
than those male protagonists
in romance novels.

62
00:03:28,282 --> 00:03:30,742
From now on,

63
00:03:30,983 --> 00:03:33,113
I will root for Pil Seung
and his relationship.

64
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:35,383
I agree with Ma Ri.

65
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,899
Everyone is hurling stones at them.

66
00:03:37,923 --> 00:03:40,153
At least we...
I mean, as his family,

67
00:03:40,323 --> 00:03:43,168
shouldn't we try to understand
Pil Seung?

68
00:03:43,192 --> 00:03:47,492
Why should Pil Seung put up with
people hurling stones at him?

69
00:03:47,492 --> 00:03:50,362
Pil Seung did nothing wrong!

70
00:03:58,312 --> 00:03:59,742
Oh, boy.

71
00:04:03,983 --> 00:04:07,482
What? That happened today?

72
00:04:08,553 --> 00:04:09,883
Yes.

73
00:04:10,622 --> 00:04:15,262
I don't think
anything can break them apart now.

74
00:04:19,263 --> 00:04:22,103
Before Park Do Ra died,

75
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,803
she told him
that the sponsorship scandal...

76
00:04:25,273 --> 00:04:27,302
was a setup
and asked Pil Seung to trust her,

77
00:04:27,302 --> 00:04:30,073
but he looked away.

78
00:04:31,542 --> 00:04:35,142
So, he thinks he was responsible
for her death.

79
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:37,883
He seems to be more in love
with her than before.

80
00:04:41,722 --> 00:04:43,053
But I have to say,

81
00:04:44,352 --> 00:04:47,452
it was strange.

82
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:50,662
What?

83
00:04:51,962 --> 00:04:55,902
How did the reporters know
to raid the wedding like that?

84
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:58,573
As soon as the bride entered.

85
00:04:58,672 --> 00:05:01,303
As if they were all following
a script someone wrote.

86
00:05:03,042 --> 00:05:05,943
And if the sponsorship scandal
really was a setup,

87
00:05:06,513 --> 00:05:09,842
someone might be deliberately
causing trouble for them...

88
00:05:10,412 --> 00:05:12,012
behind the curtain.

89
00:05:13,753 --> 00:05:15,282
Honey, you see...

90
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:18,282
I'll be fine even if Pil Seung
doesn't become our adopted son.

91
00:05:19,493 --> 00:05:20,892
But...

92
00:05:22,162 --> 00:05:26,592
can't you please help them
so they can overcome this?

93
00:05:27,693 --> 00:05:29,802
Pil Seung is Ma Ri's brother,
you know.

94
00:05:29,802 --> 00:05:33,772
And you were always fond of him.

95
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:37,173
You're the only one...

96
00:05:38,273 --> 00:05:40,043
who can help them now.

97
00:05:54,623 --> 00:05:58,532
How did the reporters know
to raid the wedding like that?

98
00:05:58,633 --> 00:06:01,068
As soon as the bride entered.

99
00:06:01,092 --> 00:06:03,733
As if they were all following
a script someone wrote.

100
00:06:13,743 --> 00:06:15,842
(The greatest con artist,
the greatest liar)

101
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,482
(Park Do Ra had a sponsor!)

102
00:06:20,753 --> 00:06:22,753
(Get lost!)

103
00:06:22,953 --> 00:06:24,152
(Park Do Ra had a sponsor!)

104
00:06:24,152 --> 00:06:25,523
(Die again, Park Do Ra.)

105
00:06:25,523 --> 00:06:28,362
(Everyone knows
Park Do Ra had a sponsor!)

106
00:06:37,503 --> 00:06:41,902
(Park Do Ra, die!)

107
00:06:47,342 --> 00:06:49,383
Pil Seung, what are you doing?

108
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,883
Do Ra, close the door.
Go back inside.

109
00:06:53,683 --> 00:06:55,023
I told you to go back inside.

110
00:06:55,023 --> 00:06:56,423
What's going on?

111
00:06:57,253 --> 00:06:59,393
(Park Do Ra, die!)

112
00:06:59,393 --> 00:07:01,023
(Everyone knows
Park Do Ra had a sponsor!)

113
00:07:01,693 --> 00:07:04,063
I told you to go back inside.
You never listen to me.

114
00:07:04,722 --> 00:07:06,762
I'll erase all of this quickly.

115
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,493
Hurry up and go back inside.

116
00:07:10,862 --> 00:07:12,303
No, Pil Seung.

117
00:07:15,342 --> 00:07:16,642
Let's do it together.

118
00:07:20,172 --> 00:07:22,842
(Everyone knows
Park Do Ra had a sponsor!)

119
00:07:26,753 --> 00:07:29,553
You disgusting witch!

120
00:07:33,592 --> 00:07:35,923
You're a con artist!

121
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:41,493
Darn you!

122
00:07:41,602 --> 00:07:44,303
You had a sponsor.
How dare you come out of your house?

123
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,472
Do you know you should be ashamed?

124
00:07:46,902 --> 00:07:49,179
Oh, is that why
you changed your face?

125
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:52,113
So what? You changed your face,
and that's it?

126
00:07:52,143 --> 00:07:55,113
Darn you. Everyone knows
that you had a sponsor!

127
00:07:55,912 --> 00:07:57,458
You shameless witch!

128
00:07:57,482 --> 00:07:59,183
Go back inside, Do Ra.

129
00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:01,483
Do not come out again.

130
00:08:01,883 --> 00:08:04,183
You went back inside?

131
00:08:06,722 --> 00:08:08,293
What are you doing?

132
00:08:08,493 --> 00:08:10,363
You did this too, didn't you?

133
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:13,109
This is a case of property damage
and defamation.

134
00:08:13,133 --> 00:08:14,933
I will report you to the police.

135
00:08:15,732 --> 00:08:17,102
Darn it!

136
00:08:18,302 --> 00:08:19,648
He hit me!

137
00:08:19,672 --> 00:08:21,272
My gosh. He hit me!

138
00:08:26,912 --> 00:08:29,012
Go ahead
and report me to the police.

139
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,483
Everything I said is a fact.

140
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:34,352
It's true Park Do Ra had a sponsor.

141
00:08:34,352 --> 00:08:36,859
It's true she changed her face
and lied!

142
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:39,853
You. I will sue you for assault.

143
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,993
- You jerk.
- My goodness.

144
00:08:41,993 --> 00:08:43,538
What's with all this noise?

145
00:08:43,562 --> 00:08:46,033
Why does this have to happen
every day in front of my house?

146
00:08:46,162 --> 00:08:48,293
Oh, my goodness.

147
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:51,033
What did we do wrong
that we have to put up with this?

148
00:08:51,202 --> 00:08:53,232
I wish she'd just move.

149
00:08:53,802 --> 00:08:56,278
Hey, reporters. Stop coming here!

150
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,573
I'm sick of this!

151
00:09:01,883 --> 00:09:03,242
I'm sorry.

152
00:09:04,082 --> 00:09:05,482
I'm sorry.

153
00:09:06,282 --> 00:09:08,553
Please let me live a quiet life,
okay?

154
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,412
Pil Seung's drama was a hit,

155
00:09:34,412 --> 00:09:36,483
so he received an award overseas...

156
00:09:36,483 --> 00:09:37,888
and even became CEO.

157
00:09:37,912 --> 00:09:40,288
His grandma bragged about it
nonstop.

158
00:09:40,312 --> 00:09:43,582
My goodness. But he eloped
with that actress who had a sponsor?

159
00:09:43,822 --> 00:09:47,252
We call it "sponsorship,"
but she's like a prostitute.

160
00:09:47,422 --> 00:09:49,099
My gosh. It's disgusting.

161
00:09:49,123 --> 00:09:50,469
Why would she do that?

162
00:09:50,493 --> 00:09:52,932
Why does he even like that woman?

163
00:09:52,932 --> 00:09:55,739
Why did he deceive everyone for her?

164
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:58,263
Pil Seung is not like that.

165
00:09:58,332 --> 00:09:59,572
I'm sure it's not true.

166
00:09:59,572 --> 00:10:01,743
What are you talking about?

167
00:10:01,743 --> 00:10:05,042
She lied that she'd died
and changed her face.

168
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:06,942
She admitted
that she and Pil Seung...

169
00:10:06,942 --> 00:10:09,283
orchestrated it together
from the get-go.

170
00:10:09,312 --> 00:10:12,582
I heard Pil Seung stepped down
as CEO too.

171
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:15,682
It's all over for him now.

172
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:17,323
- What did you say?
- My goodness.

173
00:10:17,623 --> 00:10:20,252
What on earth are you saying now?

174
00:10:20,552 --> 00:10:23,599
How dare you talk like that
when you know nothing?

175
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,763
What? Pil Seung orchestrated what?

176
00:10:26,763 --> 00:10:29,503
Who said that?
Did you see it with your own eyes?

177
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,433
Seriously, how could you do this?

178
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:33,849
We've been neighbors
for over 30 years,

179
00:10:33,873 --> 00:10:36,479
and you've known Pil Seung
since he was little.

180
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:38,972
Do you really think
Pil Seung would do such a thing?

181
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:41,959
Even if others are saying
such things,

182
00:10:41,983 --> 00:10:45,783
you ladies shouldn't do this
as our neighbors.

183
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:47,959
- My gosh.
- Also,

184
00:10:47,983 --> 00:10:51,452
about Do Ra's sponsorship scandal,
it was a setup.

185
00:10:51,483 --> 00:10:52,952
It's not true,

186
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:55,393
so don't talk about it like that!

187
00:10:55,493 --> 00:10:58,362
But that's what they said
on the news.

188
00:10:58,422 --> 00:11:00,432
Why was it on the news
if it's not true?

189
00:11:00,432 --> 00:11:03,038
What? It's fake news.

190
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,079
Don't you know
fake news is everywhere these days?

191
00:11:05,103 --> 00:11:07,148
It's all fake!

192
00:11:07,172 --> 00:11:09,102
My gosh, let's go.

193
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:11,349
- My goodness.
- Unbelievable!

194
00:11:11,373 --> 00:11:13,712
They say you should never sin
with your lips.

195
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:16,213
How will you handle it
when it all comes back to you later?

196
00:11:16,213 --> 00:11:18,513
How could you say
such horrible things?

197
00:11:19,253 --> 00:11:22,323
- You too!
- My gosh, how could they do this?

198
00:11:23,652 --> 00:11:25,023
Don't let it get to you.

199
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:28,298
They're just mean women
saying mean things.

200
00:11:28,322 --> 00:11:30,538
Don't let it upset you.

201
00:11:30,562 --> 00:11:33,132
You really shouldn't. Let's go home.

202
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:35,293
Don't do that.

203
00:11:35,402 --> 00:11:37,033
Oh, dear.

204
00:11:44,942 --> 00:11:46,273
Mom.

205
00:11:49,013 --> 00:11:50,342
Grandma.

206
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:56,859
Hey.

207
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,153
Why are you out here
when you should be at home?

208
00:11:59,893 --> 00:12:01,293
Let's go.

209
00:12:04,493 --> 00:12:05,793
Grandma.

210
00:12:07,832 --> 00:12:09,303
I'm sorry.

211
00:12:10,103 --> 00:12:11,403
And...

212
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,132
thank you.

213
00:12:18,713 --> 00:12:21,173
You don't have to apologize to me.

214
00:12:21,812 --> 00:12:23,742
I feel sorry for your mom.

215
00:12:24,613 --> 00:12:27,112
She raised you as her precious son.

216
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:29,653
What's all this mess?

217
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:32,252
Now we're at the center of gossip.

218
00:12:41,863 --> 00:12:45,572
If I catch those darn women
talking nonsense once more,

219
00:12:45,572 --> 00:12:48,673
I'll crush them for good.

220
00:13:15,463 --> 00:13:18,103
You had a sponsor.
How dare you come out of your house?

221
00:13:18,103 --> 00:13:19,202
Do you know you should be ashamed?

222
00:13:19,202 --> 00:13:21,303
Oh, is that why
you changed your face?

223
00:13:23,343 --> 00:13:25,813
You don't have to apologize to me.

224
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:28,273
I feel sorry for your mom.

225
00:13:29,213 --> 00:13:31,683
She raised you as her precious son.

226
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,212
What's all this mess?

227
00:13:34,282 --> 00:13:36,852
Now we're at the center of gossip.

228
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:55,433
Hi. Pil Seung, it's me.

229
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:57,803
Do Ra.

230
00:13:59,442 --> 00:14:01,143
I can't take it anymore.

231
00:14:02,613 --> 00:14:04,413
You did nothing...

232
00:14:05,243 --> 00:14:08,013
to deserve such vile comments
from people.

233
00:14:08,853 --> 00:14:10,482
How long must we do this for?

234
00:14:13,223 --> 00:14:14,592
Do Ra.

235
00:14:15,893 --> 00:14:17,622
We'll tackle this head-on.

236
00:14:18,993 --> 00:14:20,693
Head-on?

237
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:25,232
What do you mean by that?

238
00:14:25,733 --> 00:14:29,902
(Cha Bong Soo's Cha-cha-cha)

239
00:14:34,713 --> 00:14:37,712
Dear viewers. Welcome to
Cha Bong Soo's Cha-cha-cha.

240
00:14:37,983 --> 00:14:39,412
A few years ago,

241
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:42,482
we witnessed
an actress' tragic death.

242
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:46,168
But it turned out
that that actress didn't die.

243
00:14:46,192 --> 00:14:48,722
She was living among us.

244
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:53,263
The couple
at the center of the whirlwind...

245
00:14:53,263 --> 00:14:55,662
is Park Do Ra and Ko Pil Seung,
and they're here today.

246
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:59,732
I'll let them answer the questions
and suspicions floating around.

247
00:15:04,873 --> 00:15:07,113
How do you explain the claim...

248
00:15:07,113 --> 00:15:09,582
that you didn't want to die...

249
00:15:09,582 --> 00:15:12,852
but only get a new face
and live a new life?

250
00:15:13,052 --> 00:15:14,613
Is it even possible...

251
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:17,322
to reinvent yourself
as Kim Ji Young?

252
00:15:17,322 --> 00:15:18,322
If so,

253
00:15:18,322 --> 00:15:20,593
where is the real Kim Ji Young?

254
00:15:20,593 --> 00:15:23,123
We really thought Ji Young was...

255
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:25,793
Soon Jung's granddaughter
Kim Ji Young.

256
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:28,462
Soon Jung told us herself.

257
00:15:28,902 --> 00:15:30,032
But...

258
00:15:30,032 --> 00:15:33,602
we don't know what happened
to the real Ji Young.

259
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:37,003
Maybe Soon Jung's granddaughter
is actually dead,

260
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:40,473
but out of grief and disbelief,
Soon Jung found...

261
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:44,258
the half-dead Park Do Ra
and believed she was Ji Young.

262
00:15:44,282 --> 00:15:46,752
That's what we think happened.

263
00:15:49,322 --> 00:15:51,983
This is a medical report
from the doctor who carried out...

264
00:15:51,983 --> 00:15:53,952
Do Ra's reconstruction surgery.

265
00:15:54,652 --> 00:15:56,322
When she was brought in,

266
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,932
not just Do Ra's face
but her whole body was badly hurt.

267
00:15:58,932 --> 00:16:00,893
She was beyond recognition...

268
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:03,362
and she needed
reconstruction surgery.

269
00:16:08,072 --> 00:16:09,603
This is...

270
00:16:09,603 --> 00:16:12,572
from the neurologist
who diagnosed Do Ra...

271
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:14,372
with memory loss.

272
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:19,013
Do Ra didn't deceive
the public on purpose.

273
00:16:19,182 --> 00:16:20,882
She suffered from amnesia,

274
00:16:21,082 --> 00:16:24,023
and she really believed
she was Kim Ji Young.

275
00:16:25,792 --> 00:16:29,723
Now here's the truth
about her casting in "Seoul Lady."

276
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:31,622
Here's the interview
with writer Kim Oh Kyeong.

277
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:33,969
Hello.

278
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,503
I'm Kim Oh Kyeong.
I wrote the script for "Seoul Lady."

279
00:16:36,503 --> 00:16:38,003
("Seoul Lady" writer Kim Oh Kyeong)

280
00:16:38,003 --> 00:16:41,032
Kim Ji Young played Bun Hong
in "Seoul Lady,"

281
00:16:41,032 --> 00:16:42,872
and it was my idea.

282
00:16:43,773 --> 00:16:45,942
Kim Ji Young had a minor role
in "Don't Lie,"

283
00:16:45,942 --> 00:16:48,572
and watching her act inspired me.

284
00:16:48,572 --> 00:16:53,153
I wrote "Seoul Lady"
with Ji Young in mind as Bun Hong.

285
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,582
There's talk...

286
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:58,223
that Director Ko cast Kim
in the role...

287
00:16:58,223 --> 00:17:00,993
because he had feelings for her.

288
00:17:00,993 --> 00:17:03,293
That's a total lie.

289
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:05,863
Director Ko...

290
00:17:05,863 --> 00:17:08,863
was very concerned
because Kim Ji Young was a rookie,

291
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,263
but I insisted...

292
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:13,273
that Kim Ji Young get the role
and that's how it came to be.

293
00:17:13,273 --> 00:17:14,733
That's the fact.

294
00:17:15,173 --> 00:17:17,243
You'll have seen this video too.

295
00:17:17,773 --> 00:17:19,812
It's from a CCTV camera
that caught...

296
00:17:19,812 --> 00:17:22,842
Park Do Ra
with a supposed "sponsor."

297
00:17:23,382 --> 00:17:27,283
Some of you
might have seen this man on TV.

298
00:17:27,852 --> 00:17:29,858
This man in the video...

299
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,723
is an actor.

300
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:34,753
(Actor Hwang Jeong Sik)

301
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:37,162
Who's that? Look him up.

302
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:39,562
Hey, my gosh.

303
00:17:39,562 --> 00:17:41,409
If you have seen him,

304
00:17:41,433 --> 00:17:44,033
please call in.

305
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:48,303
Leave a comment,
send a message, or even an email.

306
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,402
Hwang Jeong Sik.

307
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,743
You confessed to me.

308
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:58,483
You said you were given
2,000 dollars to wait...

309
00:17:58,483 --> 00:18:00,152
at the hotel and pretend.

310
00:18:02,153 --> 00:18:04,652
You ruined someone's life.

311
00:18:05,622 --> 00:18:07,723
Where on earth are you hiding?

312
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:11,723
If you pity Do Ra at all,

313
00:18:12,632 --> 00:18:14,162
please call us.

314
00:18:14,792 --> 00:18:16,332
Hwang Jeong Sik.

315
00:18:17,602 --> 00:18:19,803
If what I said isn't true,

316
00:18:20,372 --> 00:18:22,332
show yourself right now...

317
00:18:22,642 --> 00:18:24,543
and sue me
for making a false accusation.

318
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:27,573
Hwang Jeong Sik.

319
00:18:27,842 --> 00:18:29,642
Please tell the truth.

320
00:18:30,282 --> 00:18:32,142
We hope to hear from you.

321
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:48,063
Hey, Mr. Jung.
Get Hwang out of the country.

322
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:50,033
He must leave this instant.

323
00:18:50,403 --> 00:18:52,402
I can't reach him.

324
00:18:52,602 --> 00:18:54,132
His number no longer exists.

325
00:18:55,743 --> 00:18:58,219
What the heck?

326
00:18:58,243 --> 00:18:59,243
(Cha Bong Soo's Cha-cha-cha)

327
00:18:59,243 --> 00:19:00,612
Thanks a lot.

328
00:19:01,413 --> 00:19:05,582
I was reluctant to ask
because you'd get caught up too,

329
00:19:06,052 --> 00:19:07,612
but you agreed to it.

330
00:19:07,882 --> 00:19:11,922
I'm actually hurt
that you feel the need to say that.

331
00:19:11,953 --> 00:19:14,293
Who would I believe if not you two?

332
00:19:14,523 --> 00:19:18,793
This is an issue
where the truth must come out.

333
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,203
And Ji Young...

334
00:19:24,503 --> 00:19:27,432
To think that you were Do Ra...

335
00:19:27,572 --> 00:19:29,402
Do Ra, I really...

336
00:19:29,542 --> 00:19:31,773
I really cried so much
after you died.

337
00:19:31,773 --> 00:19:34,213
I regretted fighting with you
during our shoot...

338
00:19:34,213 --> 00:19:36,683
and thought
I should've treated you better.

339
00:19:36,683 --> 00:19:38,413
My dear Do Ra.

340
00:19:38,413 --> 00:19:41,352
I'm so grateful you're back.

341
00:19:41,352 --> 00:19:42,882
Do Ra...

342
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:44,723
- Thanks, Bong Soo.
- No.

343
00:19:44,723 --> 00:19:46,052
Thank you so much.

344
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:48,152
Sure, Do Ra.

345
00:19:48,923 --> 00:19:50,493
- Bong Soo.
- Do Ra...

346
00:19:50,493 --> 00:19:54,293
People will criticize you too
after this show.

347
00:19:54,862 --> 00:19:56,162
I'm sorry.

348
00:19:56,433 --> 00:20:00,402
Can you stop saying you're sorry?

349
00:20:00,602 --> 00:20:03,973
I'd like to use this
to boost viewership...

350
00:20:03,973 --> 00:20:06,372
and become the proud owner
of a viral clip.

351
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:11,713
Come on.

352
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:13,983
Hi, Chul Soo.

353
00:20:17,582 --> 00:20:18,953
What?

354
00:20:26,256 --> 00:20:27,626
Do Ra.

355
00:20:28,197 --> 00:20:29,626
Stay here.

356
00:20:30,356 --> 00:20:32,526
Why? I should come with you.

357
00:20:32,526 --> 00:20:34,027
I want to come.

358
00:20:34,197 --> 00:20:35,667
There are too many people here.

359
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,266
I'll have a quick talk in private.

360
00:20:37,266 --> 00:20:40,167
I'll get Hwang Jeong Sik's address.

361
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:43,552
So, don't get out of the car.
Wait here.

362
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:44,876
But...

363
00:20:48,076 --> 00:20:49,977
Okay.

364
00:21:35,256 --> 00:21:36,626
Hello, ma'am.

365
00:21:37,826 --> 00:21:41,066
You're Kim Hong Soon, right?

366
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:43,866
That's me.

367
00:21:45,606 --> 00:21:47,037
Do I know you?

368
00:21:48,637 --> 00:21:50,336
My name is Ko Pil Seung.

369
00:21:51,606 --> 00:21:54,646
You're Hwang Jeong Sik's mother.

370
00:21:56,776 --> 00:21:59,187
How do you know my son?

371
00:21:59,447 --> 00:22:01,586
I've been looking for him...

372
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,787
regarding an important matter.

373
00:22:04,627 --> 00:22:07,687
Where is your son?

374
00:22:08,756 --> 00:22:10,096
Why?

375
00:22:10,627 --> 00:22:12,727
Are you here to take him away?

376
00:22:14,996 --> 00:22:18,437
I haven't been in contact
with him for ages,

377
00:22:18,566 --> 00:22:20,406
and I don't know where he is.

378
00:22:23,377 --> 00:22:24,747
Ms. Kim.

379
00:22:26,407 --> 00:22:28,177
Do you know the actress Park Do Ra?

380
00:22:29,246 --> 00:22:30,977
The actress who died
a few years ago.

381
00:22:32,046 --> 00:22:33,487
Yes, I know who she is.

382
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:38,487
Why are you suddenly asking
about a deceased actress?

383
00:22:39,387 --> 00:22:40,886
That actress died...

384
00:22:41,796 --> 00:22:43,697
because of Mr. Hwang.

385
00:22:45,796 --> 00:22:48,667
You're a despicable human being!

386
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:52,037
My son has nothing to do
with Park Do Ra,

387
00:22:52,566 --> 00:22:54,707
so why would you say that?

388
00:22:55,806 --> 00:22:59,846
He’s not the type of person
who would hurt others.

389
00:23:01,147 --> 00:23:04,646
If you're going to speak ill of him,
leave this second.

390
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,287
Someone paid...

391
00:23:06,617 --> 00:23:08,987
your son 2,000 dollars...

392
00:23:09,217 --> 00:23:12,487
to meet with Park Do Ra at a hotel.

393
00:23:14,086 --> 00:23:16,727
I'm not trying to hurt Mr. Hwang.

394
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:18,826
I just want to find out
who paid him.

395
00:23:18,826 --> 00:23:20,667
But in order to find that person,

396
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,967
I need your son's help.

397
00:23:24,296 --> 00:23:28,237
Please let me meet your son
this one time.

398
00:23:28,576 --> 00:23:31,136
Tell me where he is
in the Philippines, or...

399
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,546
get him on the phone for me.

400
00:23:36,016 --> 00:23:37,546
Because of what he did,

401
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,247
a woman's reputation was muddied,

402
00:23:42,316 --> 00:23:44,116
and she tried to take her own life.

403
00:23:45,586 --> 00:23:47,227
Please let her live...

404
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:50,197
without the burden of that stigma.

405
00:23:51,796 --> 00:23:53,396
I'm begging you, ma'am.

406
00:23:56,937 --> 00:23:58,636
I don't know anything.

407
00:24:01,336 --> 00:24:03,713
I don't know his phone number.

408
00:24:03,737 --> 00:24:05,977
There's nothing I can tell you.

409
00:24:07,306 --> 00:24:10,747
So, please don't come back here.

410
00:24:23,627 --> 00:24:27,497
Ms. Kim, here's my business card.

411
00:24:28,397 --> 00:24:29,836
If you...

412
00:24:30,596 --> 00:24:32,507
change your mind,

413
00:24:33,237 --> 00:24:35,037
or Mr. Hwang calls,

414
00:24:35,276 --> 00:24:38,136
please let me know.

415
00:24:46,246 --> 00:24:48,787
Mr. Hwang's crimes
aren't that serious.

416
00:24:49,356 --> 00:24:52,927
He could even talk it out
with Ms. Park.

417
00:24:54,056 --> 00:24:55,997
He shouldn't have to live...

418
00:24:56,026 --> 00:24:58,366
overseas his whole life
because of this.

419
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:01,267
You had...

420
00:25:02,036 --> 00:25:04,566
a tough time being away
from your son too.

421
00:25:08,076 --> 00:25:09,576
Also, your son's face...

422
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:11,906
is known to the public now,

423
00:25:12,576 --> 00:25:14,447
which will make it hard for him
to stay hidden.

424
00:25:19,147 --> 00:25:21,346
Please contact Mr. Hwang...

425
00:25:21,917 --> 00:25:23,886
and tell him to call me.

426
00:25:24,657 --> 00:25:27,687
I'll help him the best I can.

427
00:25:45,276 --> 00:25:48,046
Jeong Sik, where are you?

428
00:25:48,477 --> 00:25:52,987
A man named Ko Pil Seung
just came by asking for you.

429
00:25:56,417 --> 00:26:00,027
There wasn't any need for you
to take care of this old woman too.

430
00:26:00,586 --> 00:26:02,997
Of course, I should care for you.

431
00:26:03,596 --> 00:26:06,596
I'll make sure
you get regular facials,

432
00:26:06,927 --> 00:26:09,136
so make it a habit of joining me.

433
00:26:09,796 --> 00:26:12,636
Auntie, how's the treatment?

434
00:26:12,836 --> 00:26:14,207
It's nice.

435
00:26:14,207 --> 00:26:15,353
Right?

436
00:26:15,377 --> 00:26:18,707
Skin should frequently be cared for
like this.

437
00:26:21,306 --> 00:26:24,447
Auntie, people would believe
that we're peers.

438
00:26:24,647 --> 00:26:27,187
You and your silly remarks.

439
00:26:27,717 --> 00:26:31,487
Auntie, you're the one I rely on
in this family.

440
00:26:32,026 --> 00:26:33,826
Jin Dan and I...

441
00:26:34,187 --> 00:26:37,427
only have you to rely on
in this world.

442
00:26:37,856 --> 00:26:39,802
Chairman Gong...

443
00:26:39,826 --> 00:26:42,537
is always ready
to get rid of Jin Dan.

444
00:26:42,796 --> 00:26:44,137
He desperately wants
to adopt a man...

445
00:26:44,137 --> 00:26:45,883
who isn't related to him by blood.

446
00:26:45,907 --> 00:26:47,467
Don't worry about that.

447
00:26:48,477 --> 00:26:50,177
The ordeal with Park Do Ra...

448
00:26:50,407 --> 00:26:52,707
must've gotten Chairman Gong
to think it over.

449
00:26:53,306 --> 00:26:55,193
If he adopts Ko Pil Seung,

450
00:26:55,217 --> 00:26:57,747
Park Do Ra will be
his daughter-in-law.

451
00:26:58,086 --> 00:26:59,586
A family like ours...

452
00:26:59,586 --> 00:27:01,222
should never accept
a daughter-in-law like her.

453
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:02,433
Right?

454
00:27:02,457 --> 00:27:05,302
Adopting Ko Pil Seung
in the first place...

455
00:27:05,326 --> 00:27:07,386
was preposterous if you ask me.

456
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:12,197
Chairman Gong should realize
how precious you and Jin Dan are.

457
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:15,396
If I'm being honest,

458
00:27:16,397 --> 00:27:17,967
I want to thank you.

459
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:20,207
Sorry? You want to thank me?

460
00:27:20,437 --> 00:27:24,537
All this time, you devoted yourself
to my brother...

461
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:27,207
and focused on raising Jin Dan...

462
00:27:27,707 --> 00:27:29,346
while remaining a widow.

463
00:27:29,947 --> 00:27:32,846
You have no idea
how reassuring it feels...

464
00:27:32,846 --> 00:27:34,816
to have Jin Dan in our family.

465
00:27:36,217 --> 00:27:39,386
I'll protect Jin Dan at all costs
to show my gratitude toward you,

466
00:27:39,887 --> 00:27:42,197
so don't worry.

467
00:27:43,096 --> 00:27:44,796
Thank you, Auntie.

468
00:27:45,427 --> 00:27:47,866
I'll keep relying on you too.

469
00:27:48,437 --> 00:27:51,272
Auntie, let's grab dinner as well
while we're out.

470
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:52,913
I booked a table
at a delicious restaurant.

471
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:54,237
Sure thing.

472
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:22,673
My gosh!

473
00:28:22,697 --> 00:28:23,997
Hush.

474
00:28:24,667 --> 00:28:26,066
Quiet.

475
00:28:26,937 --> 00:28:30,306
You're Hwang Jeong Sik's mother,
aren't you?

476
00:28:32,076 --> 00:28:34,806
Who... Who are you?

477
00:28:36,076 --> 00:28:37,646
Where's Hwang Jeong Sik?

478
00:28:38,046 --> 00:28:40,546
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

479
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:45,687
It's been a long time
since I saw my son.

480
00:28:47,356 --> 00:28:48,727
What?

481
00:28:49,056 --> 00:28:51,826
He extorted money from me,
saying he was going to see you.

482
00:28:52,596 --> 00:28:54,766
Call him this instant, then. Do it!

483
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,237
I don't know anything.

484
00:28:57,036 --> 00:28:58,937
I don't even know...

485
00:28:59,266 --> 00:29:01,806
his phone number.

486
00:29:02,306 --> 00:29:04,437
- Don't lie to me.
- My goodness.

487
00:29:04,606 --> 00:29:07,906
I really have no idea.

488
00:29:14,387 --> 00:29:15,717
Then,

489
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:20,626
tell him this when he comes here.

490
00:29:21,487 --> 00:29:23,427
He needs to hurry back
to the Philippines.

491
00:29:24,397 --> 00:29:27,027
If I catch him
roaming the streets in Korea,

492
00:29:28,536 --> 00:29:30,796
he'll be a dead man for sure.

493
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:32,806
Got it?

494
00:29:32,967 --> 00:29:34,806
Yes...

495
00:29:43,316 --> 00:29:47,017
Goodness me. What on earth?

496
00:29:50,217 --> 00:29:53,187
- You did great.
- Do Ra, I'm proud of you.

497
00:29:53,187 --> 00:29:54,626
Do Jun.

498
00:29:58,526 --> 00:29:59,927
You did a great job.

499
00:30:00,026 --> 00:30:01,566
Pil Seung, you did great as well.

500
00:30:02,996 --> 00:30:05,866
How did you decide to go public
like that?

501
00:30:08,677 --> 00:30:11,806
It was actually Pil Seung's idea.

502
00:30:12,647 --> 00:30:14,507
I think you made the right choice.

503
00:30:14,776 --> 00:30:16,252
There were some hate comments,

504
00:30:16,276 --> 00:30:18,846
but many have been showing empathy.

505
00:30:21,217 --> 00:30:23,286
Do Jun and I read all the comments.

506
00:30:23,286 --> 00:30:26,027
Many shared their thoughts,
and the video went viral.

507
00:30:26,927 --> 00:30:29,203
If only someone would call us...

508
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:30,997
about Hwang Jeong Sik's whereabouts.

509
00:30:32,467 --> 00:30:34,396
I'm sure someone will call us.

510
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:37,913
That being said, Do Ra, stay home...

511
00:30:37,937 --> 00:30:39,836
until we get a tip about him.

512
00:30:40,066 --> 00:30:41,566
I'll run errands for you.

513
00:30:42,637 --> 00:30:44,177
Sure thing.

514
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:49,316
Have you guys been able
to sit down for meals?

515
00:30:49,677 --> 00:30:51,017
What?

516
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:52,616
Well...

517
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:55,532
Did...

518
00:30:55,556 --> 00:30:56,856
we eat?

519
00:30:57,516 --> 00:30:59,326
I guess you were so busy
being chased...

520
00:30:59,326 --> 00:31:01,927
that you don't even remember
whether or not you've eaten.

521
00:31:01,996 --> 00:31:03,096
Pil Seung, stay and have some food.

522
00:31:03,096 --> 00:31:05,197
I can make
really good soybean paste stew.

523
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:06,927
- Sit. You, come with me.
- Okay.

524
00:31:14,106 --> 00:31:15,477
Hello?

525
00:31:16,137 --> 00:31:19,646
I'm Hwang Jeong Sik's mother.

526
00:31:20,907 --> 00:31:22,247
Yes, ma'am.

527
00:31:30,717 --> 00:31:31,727
Thank you.

528
00:31:31,727 --> 00:31:34,527
My son will be here soon.

529
00:31:34,627 --> 00:31:37,156
Meet him and talk to him.

530
00:31:37,356 --> 00:31:38,667
Okay.

531
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:49,177
Mom!

532
00:31:49,177 --> 00:31:50,507
Jeong Sik!

533
00:31:50,977 --> 00:31:54,022
You should talk to them, okay?

534
00:31:54,046 --> 00:31:55,292
Darn it.

535
00:31:55,316 --> 00:31:56,747
Mr. Hwang Jeong Sik!

536
00:31:58,316 --> 00:31:59,616
Darn it.

537
00:32:00,046 --> 00:32:02,316
Let go! I said to let go!

538
00:32:02,316 --> 00:32:04,987
Hold on. Let's talk!

539
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:09,697
You must've read the articles
about Do Ra.

540
00:32:10,457 --> 00:32:12,526
She had died,
but she came back alive.

541
00:32:12,526 --> 00:32:16,096
She went through so much
to come back to life,

542
00:32:16,766 --> 00:32:19,866
but she can't even go outside now
because of the sponsorship scandal.

543
00:32:20,237 --> 00:32:22,707
Everyone is pointing the finger
at her.

544
00:32:23,937 --> 00:32:25,376
Mr. Hwang.

545
00:32:25,907 --> 00:32:27,806
Please tell the truth.

546
00:32:29,076 --> 00:32:31,876
You got paid 2,000 dollars
for the job.

547
00:32:32,286 --> 00:32:34,146
Please tell everyone
she never had a sponsor.

548
00:32:34,447 --> 00:32:36,957
Tell everyone the truth. Please?

549
00:32:39,387 --> 00:32:42,656
I know nothing.
I don't know anything!

550
00:33:01,576 --> 00:33:03,116
Sir.

551
00:33:05,286 --> 00:33:07,247
I am Park Do Ra.

552
00:33:07,846 --> 00:33:09,616
I don't know you, miss.

553
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:13,026
Why are you doing this to me?

554
00:33:13,026 --> 00:33:14,527
Sir.

555
00:33:15,697 --> 00:33:18,767
After that incident,
I really tried to take my own life.

556
00:33:19,796 --> 00:33:21,596
But I miraculously...

557
00:33:22,437 --> 00:33:23,997
survived.

558
00:33:25,707 --> 00:33:28,306
But now, everyone calls me
an actress who had a sponsor...

559
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:31,306
and a con artist
who deceived the whole country.

560
00:33:31,377 --> 00:33:32,806
Sir.

561
00:33:33,546 --> 00:33:35,447
Should I die again?

562
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:40,016
Do I have to be criticized
for the rest of my life...

563
00:33:40,016 --> 00:33:42,257
for something I didn't do?

564
00:33:44,586 --> 00:33:46,126
Sir.

565
00:33:47,427 --> 00:33:50,896
Please, sir. Please help me
so I don't have to die.

566
00:33:51,526 --> 00:33:54,596
Please save me, sir.

567
00:33:55,137 --> 00:33:56,967
Please, sir!

568
00:33:56,967 --> 00:34:00,406
Please help me clear my name, sir.

569
00:34:00,506 --> 00:34:03,036
Please save me, sir.

570
00:34:03,036 --> 00:34:06,346
Please help me clear my name, sir.

571
00:34:06,346 --> 00:34:08,677
- Sir...
- Tell us who put you up to it,

572
00:34:09,217 --> 00:34:12,086
and we'll help you...

573
00:34:12,086 --> 00:34:14,217
get your sentence reduced, okay?

574
00:34:14,586 --> 00:34:15,586
You have my word.

575
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:18,416
Sir. Please, sir...

576
00:34:18,416 --> 00:34:19,787
Jeong Sik.

577
00:34:20,586 --> 00:34:23,627
Please do
what they're asking you to do.

578
00:34:24,626 --> 00:34:27,967
You should never do
such a bad thing.

579
00:34:27,967 --> 00:34:29,397
Sir...

580
00:34:29,566 --> 00:34:33,506
It's wrong to drive someone
to suicide.

581
00:34:34,767 --> 00:34:37,637
What are you going to do...

582
00:34:37,637 --> 00:34:40,146
when karma bites back?

583
00:34:40,146 --> 00:34:42,976
- Sir, please...
- Jeong Sik.

584
00:34:42,976 --> 00:34:46,716
Please save me, sir.

585
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:57,573
So, you got paid 2,000 dollars
to act like you were her sponsor.

586
00:34:57,597 --> 00:34:58,997
Is it true?

587
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:04,696
Yes.

588
00:35:05,606 --> 00:35:07,037
It is true.

589
00:35:08,166 --> 00:35:10,506
I was told I'd get 2,000 dollars
for calling actress Park Do Ra...

590
00:35:10,537 --> 00:35:13,006
to the hotel and just spending
two hours with her.

591
00:35:15,816 --> 00:35:18,547
I was struggling financially,
so I had no choice but to do it.

592
00:35:20,646 --> 00:35:22,256
Ms. Park Do Ra looked like...

593
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:26,227
she really thought it was
for a meeting for a cosmetics ad.

594
00:35:27,487 --> 00:35:29,096
She had to put up with...

595
00:35:30,157 --> 00:35:32,156
such dishonorable accusations
because of me.

596
00:35:33,066 --> 00:35:34,596
For that, I sincerely apologize.

597
00:35:36,637 --> 00:35:37,637
I, too, was miserable...

598
00:35:37,637 --> 00:35:40,006
while wandering around
in the Philippines.

599
00:35:42,077 --> 00:35:43,437
But...

600
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:48,076
I heard Ms. Park Do Ra came back,

601
00:35:48,876 --> 00:35:51,017
so I mustered up the courage
to be here today.

602
00:35:51,847 --> 00:35:53,216
Then...

603
00:35:53,546 --> 00:35:56,317
who paid you to do something
like that?

604
00:35:56,416 --> 00:35:58,756
That I already told the police.

605
00:36:00,287 --> 00:36:02,256
It'll be revealed
once the investigation is over.

606
00:36:03,097 --> 00:36:05,056
I'd like to...

607
00:36:06,827 --> 00:36:09,337
apologize to Ms. Park Do Ra
once again.

608
00:36:11,066 --> 00:36:13,067
I'm really sorry, Ms. Park Do Ra.

Do these people
have nothing better to do?

615
00:36:37,384 --> 00:36:40,625
Fine, try and find me...

616
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:42,125
because you won't.

617
00:36:44,895 --> 00:36:46,324
But...

618
00:36:46,895 --> 00:36:50,534
what if I get busted?

619
00:36:52,765 --> 00:36:54,935
No. That can't happen!

621
00:36:57,134 --> 00:36:59,275
Then I'm really doomed.

622
00:37:00,274 --> 00:37:01,775
Darn it.

623
00:37:06,285 --> 00:37:08,715
Mr. Jung, it's me.

624
00:37:33,975 --> 00:37:37,244
Take this money
and go somewhere far away.

625
00:37:37,584 --> 00:37:40,145
Somewhere very far away.

626
00:37:40,814 --> 00:37:42,154
Also,

627
00:37:42,484 --> 00:37:45,085
this won't happen,

628
00:37:46,084 --> 00:37:47,954
but if you get caught...

629
00:37:49,095 --> 00:37:50,330
You know what to do, right?

630
00:37:50,354 --> 00:37:51,701
Yes, of course.

631
00:37:51,725 --> 00:37:54,534
I'll protect you until the end.

632
00:37:55,495 --> 00:37:57,065
Don't worry.

633
00:37:58,604 --> 00:37:59,934
All right.

634
00:38:00,564 --> 00:38:02,974
Stay safe,
and don't get caught, okay?

636
00:38:16,555 --> 00:38:18,154
Oh, my goodness.

637
00:38:18,616 --> 00:38:21,126
It really was a setup.

638
00:38:21,355 --> 00:38:24,255
Who would do this to Park Do Ra?

639
00:38:24,326 --> 00:38:26,226
My gosh. This is insane.

640
00:38:26,926 --> 00:38:31,195
Her life was destroyed
because of what this jerk did.

641
00:38:31,296 --> 00:38:33,736
I really want to know
what this jerk looks like.

642
00:38:33,736 --> 00:38:35,236
My goodness.

643
00:38:35,236 --> 00:38:39,476
This jerk deserves
to be stoned to death.

644
00:38:39,906 --> 00:38:42,245
All those disgusting false rumors
about her...

645
00:38:42,245 --> 00:38:44,415
must've really stressed her out.

646
00:38:44,415 --> 00:38:46,176
She must've been utterly distraught.

647
00:38:46,176 --> 00:38:48,016
No wonder
she tried to take her own life.

648
00:38:48,446 --> 00:38:50,216
I know.

649
00:38:50,216 --> 00:38:52,415
She must've been so humiliated.
It's really unfair.

650
00:38:52,415 --> 00:38:55,186
Everyone pointed the finger at her.

651
00:38:56,386 --> 00:38:58,826
I feel so bad for her.

652
00:38:59,326 --> 00:39:02,225
Anyway, who is this jerk?

653
00:39:02,225 --> 00:39:05,735
This jerk should get struck
by lightning and die.

654
00:39:05,765 --> 00:39:08,165
The police are investigating
the case,

655
00:39:08,165 --> 00:39:10,436
so they'll catch him soon.

656
00:39:11,676 --> 00:39:13,406
Anyway, I must say,

657
00:39:13,406 --> 00:39:16,605
I feel so bad for Do Ra.

658
00:39:16,605 --> 00:39:18,076
I pity her.

659
00:39:18,076 --> 00:39:21,785
Yes, I pity her
and feel bad for her too.

660
00:39:21,785 --> 00:39:24,855
I hope they catch
and punish this jerk soon.

661
00:39:24,855 --> 00:39:26,286
But...

662
00:39:26,855 --> 00:39:30,755
even so, I really hope
Pil Seung doesn't stay with her.

663
00:39:31,395 --> 00:39:35,596
Besides,
she is Baek Mi Ja's daughter.

664
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:38,065
Honey, please. That's enough.

665
00:39:38,065 --> 00:39:40,736
It's about time you accepted her
after everything Pil Seung did.

666
00:39:40,736 --> 00:39:41,906
Think about...

667
00:39:41,906 --> 00:39:44,065
how heartbroken Pil Seung would be
if you kept this up.

668
00:39:44,065 --> 00:39:46,705
I can't accept her
because it's simply unacceptable.

669
00:39:46,705 --> 00:39:50,005
What can I do?
I really can't accept her!

670
00:39:55,046 --> 00:39:57,016
- My gosh.
- Oh, dear.

671
00:39:57,785 --> 00:39:59,115
Goodness me.

672
00:39:59,285 --> 00:40:00,956
Hi, Mr. Ko.

673
00:40:02,656 --> 00:40:04,025
What?

674
00:40:04,725 --> 00:40:08,166
Who was the one to leak to the press
about Park Do Ra on the day...

675
00:40:08,265 --> 00:40:09,596
of Pil Seung's wedding?

676
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:15,335
Okay.

677
00:40:19,475 --> 00:40:20,876
How come...

678
00:40:33,486 --> 00:40:34,885
You asked to see me?

679
00:40:36,185 --> 00:40:37,686
What's this about?

680
00:40:37,725 --> 00:40:39,795
At Pil Seung's wedding.

681
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:41,896
The news about Park Do Ra.

682
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:45,166
Were you the one
who alerted the press?

683
00:40:47,165 --> 00:40:48,766
Why would you ask me that?

684
00:40:49,006 --> 00:40:50,835
Is it true or not?

685
00:40:52,506 --> 00:40:53,905
Just tell me that.

686
00:40:54,776 --> 00:40:57,876
Jin Taek, are you looking into me
in secret?

687
00:40:58,546 --> 00:41:00,576
Why do you want to know that?

688
00:41:03,015 --> 00:41:04,615
It was you.

689
00:41:05,386 --> 00:41:06,755
You punk.

690
00:41:07,386 --> 00:41:09,786
How could you do something that low?

691
00:41:10,785 --> 00:41:12,856
How is that low?

692
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:16,496
Jin Taek, are you saying
I'm in the wrong?

693
00:41:16,796 --> 00:41:18,241
I'm not.

694
00:41:18,265 --> 00:41:20,396
Those two are in the wrong.

695
00:41:20,736 --> 00:41:23,266
The whole world's
criticizing them...

696
00:41:23,435 --> 00:41:25,176
and you're criticizing me?

697
00:41:25,176 --> 00:41:27,376
What did you say?

698
00:41:27,605 --> 00:41:29,445
Even so,

699
00:41:29,475 --> 00:41:32,045
how could you do something like that
at their wedding?

700
00:41:32,616 --> 00:41:36,291
Don't you know how much
they're suffering now because of it?

701
00:41:36,315 --> 00:41:39,686
I get that you were mad about her,
but how could you do such a thing?

702
00:41:40,716 --> 00:41:42,125
I said...

703
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,726
I didn't want her
to marry Pil Seung.

704
00:41:44,955 --> 00:41:46,296
That's why I did it.

705
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:47,655
What?

706
00:41:49,196 --> 00:41:51,465
My gosh, Jin Taek.

707
00:41:52,296 --> 00:41:55,005
You still haven't given up on him?

708
00:41:55,535 --> 00:41:57,806
Now that he was proven a loser
that you can't adopt,

709
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:59,706
are you taking it out on me?

710
00:42:00,576 --> 00:42:03,676
Jin Taek. When you die and meet...

711
00:42:03,676 --> 00:42:05,451
our father in the afterlife,

712
00:42:05,475 --> 00:42:07,216
I bet he'll slap you silly...

713
00:42:07,216 --> 00:42:09,686
because of what you're doing!

714
00:42:11,355 --> 00:42:12,561
Jin Taek.

715
00:42:12,585 --> 00:42:15,525
I might be
just a half-brother to you,

716
00:42:15,725 --> 00:42:17,626
but I'm still your brother.

717
00:42:18,196 --> 00:42:21,425
We're Gongs
and we share the same blood.

718
00:42:21,926 --> 00:42:24,425
How can you defend that fool
all the time?

719
00:42:25,796 --> 00:42:27,266
Darn it.

720
00:42:34,546 --> 00:42:36,106
What a fool.

721
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:38,545
What a coward.

722
00:42:45,315 --> 00:42:48,502
Where's your grandmother?
I got some red bean bread she likes.

723
00:42:48,526 --> 00:42:49,956
Thanks.

724
00:42:51,625 --> 00:42:53,601
Since I can't go outside,

725
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:57,226
Do Sik took her on a walk
to check out the market.

726
00:42:58,866 --> 00:43:00,335
We should go out too.

727
00:43:01,035 --> 00:43:02,365
What?

728
00:43:06,576 --> 00:43:10,476
Pil Seung, I'm not sure
about that yet.

729
00:43:12,616 --> 00:43:16,092
Do Ra, let's stop hiding
all the time.

730
00:43:16,116 --> 00:43:18,186
Let's practice
being out in the world.

731
00:43:18,955 --> 00:43:21,016
We explained the truth...

732
00:43:22,386 --> 00:43:24,425
and you have a knight by your side.

733
00:43:25,495 --> 00:43:26,996
A knight?

734
00:43:34,535 --> 00:43:37,505
Pil Seung. Do you think...

735
00:43:38,035 --> 00:43:41,276
the guy called Mr. Jung
who paid Hwang Jeong Sik...

736
00:43:41,276 --> 00:43:42,606
is the real culprit?

737
00:43:44,406 --> 00:43:47,715
Who is this person
to do something like that to me?

738
00:43:49,815 --> 00:43:52,061
The police are after him.

739
00:43:52,085 --> 00:43:54,416
We'll know why he did it
when he's caught.

740
00:43:56,855 --> 00:43:58,356
Get ready.

741
00:43:58,426 --> 00:44:01,326
You've been invited today.

742
00:44:02,026 --> 00:44:04,326
Who would invite me?

743
00:44:05,165 --> 00:44:07,936
You'll see. Trust me and tag along.

744
00:44:08,406 --> 00:44:10,252
(Goban Restaurant)

745
00:44:19,815 --> 00:44:22,985
Do Ra. It's okay.

746
00:44:26,386 --> 00:44:29,556
It's fine. I'll serve this table.

747
00:44:29,556 --> 00:44:31,025
Thanks.

748
00:44:31,556 --> 00:44:34,032
Dad, I'll do it if you're busy.

749
00:44:34,056 --> 00:44:36,772
No. I want to cook for you myself.

750
00:44:36,796 --> 00:44:39,166
Sit and wait.
I'll cook it nicely for you.

751
00:44:40,096 --> 00:44:42,465
Let's see.

752
00:44:45,776 --> 00:44:47,505
This is...

753
00:44:47,705 --> 00:44:51,646
a new item we just added
to the menu. Have a taste.

754
00:44:57,546 --> 00:44:59,016
Thank you.

755
00:45:09,526 --> 00:45:12,795
It's nicely seasoned
and delicious, Father.

756
00:45:13,995 --> 00:45:15,766
"Father?"

757
00:45:16,306 --> 00:45:19,405
I like how that sounds.

758
00:45:20,375 --> 00:45:22,945
Have some more.

759
00:45:23,006 --> 00:45:25,621
I'll cut up some more.
Eat all you want.

760
00:45:25,645 --> 00:45:27,516
Eat up.

761
00:45:27,546 --> 00:45:29,246
- Dad.
- What?

762
00:45:29,515 --> 00:45:30,916
What about me?

763
00:45:30,946 --> 00:45:34,585
You're pretty good at grilling meat.
Grill your own.

764
00:45:34,955 --> 00:45:36,286
Eat.

765
00:45:36,855 --> 00:45:40,226
Are you favoring
your daughter-in-law already?

766
00:45:40,625 --> 00:45:42,666
Your son is second-best now?

767
00:45:44,265 --> 00:45:47,536
Okay, fine. Here's a small piece.

768
00:45:49,006 --> 00:45:50,905
Thank you.

769
00:45:53,306 --> 00:45:55,705
- Eat up.
- You should join us.

770
00:45:55,705 --> 00:45:57,646
No, it's fine.

771
00:45:57,705 --> 00:45:59,146
Goodness.

772
00:45:59,315 --> 00:46:02,715
Well, I do feel sorry for Do Ra,

773
00:46:03,046 --> 00:46:06,462
and Pil Seung likes her so much,
so why disapprove of them now?

774
00:46:06,486 --> 00:46:07,916
It's a waste of energy.

775
00:46:10,125 --> 00:46:13,295
Anyway, we raised him well
and lost him.

776
00:46:23,105 --> 00:46:24,405
Mom.

777
00:46:24,975 --> 00:46:26,306
Did you have dinner?

778
00:46:27,676 --> 00:46:31,546
Don't mind
whether I had dinner or not...

779
00:46:31,546 --> 00:46:34,746
and go on following Do Ra around.

780
00:46:36,015 --> 00:46:38,632
You don't even care...

781
00:46:38,656 --> 00:46:40,655
if I ate or not.

782
00:46:42,855 --> 00:46:44,456
What's up with you?

783
00:46:45,926 --> 00:46:49,326
Mom. I have something to confess.

784
00:46:51,866 --> 00:46:53,235
What is it?

785
00:46:54,466 --> 00:46:57,936
I actually like you more than Do Ra.

786
00:46:58,176 --> 00:47:01,476
What? Get off me.

787
00:47:01,506 --> 00:47:03,246
My goodness.

788
00:47:03,276 --> 00:47:06,376
I can see you're blatantly lying.

789
00:47:06,546 --> 00:47:09,445
It's not a lie.
I'm telling the truth.

790
00:47:11,986 --> 00:47:14,956
Mom. Thank you.

791
00:47:15,585 --> 00:47:17,025
Thanks a lot.

792
00:47:17,886 --> 00:47:19,496
For what?

793
00:47:21,326 --> 00:47:23,666
I just want to thank you.

794
00:47:25,535 --> 00:47:27,335
I need you to know...

795
00:47:28,205 --> 00:47:30,206
I love you and that I'm grateful.

796
00:47:31,676 --> 00:47:33,235
Whatever.

797
00:47:34,535 --> 00:47:37,282
Mom. Shall I make you
kimchi fried rice?

798
00:47:37,306 --> 00:47:39,322
You love my kimchi fried rice.

799
00:47:39,346 --> 00:47:42,161
I'll show off my skills today
for you.

800
00:47:42,185 --> 00:47:44,746
No, thanks. I won't eat.

801
00:47:46,656 --> 00:47:47,931
Mom.

802
00:47:47,955 --> 00:47:51,226
What got into you? Get away from me.

803
00:47:53,026 --> 00:47:56,072
Go away. I have clothes to fold.

804
00:47:56,096 --> 00:47:57,565
I'll do it.

805
00:47:58,596 --> 00:48:01,766
My goodness...

806
00:48:06,776 --> 00:48:08,376
Darn it.

807
00:48:21,185 --> 00:48:22,556
All in.

808
00:48:23,625 --> 00:48:24,985
All in.

809
00:48:25,426 --> 00:48:27,855
- I'm out. Shoot.
- Me too.

810
00:48:27,855 --> 00:48:29,596
I can't do this anymore.

811
00:48:32,696 --> 00:48:35,241
The doenjang jjigae's lovely today.

812
00:48:35,265 --> 00:48:36,406
It is.

813
00:48:36,406 --> 00:48:39,252
They say people prefer
light breakfasts these days,

814
00:48:39,276 --> 00:48:41,282
but I'm old-fashioned,

815
00:48:41,306 --> 00:48:43,776
and I prefer
doenjang jjigae and rice.

816
00:48:43,776 --> 00:48:44,915
So do I.

817
00:48:44,915 --> 00:48:48,076
I miss rice and kimchi
if I eat bread for too long.

818
00:48:49,815 --> 00:48:51,286
Chairman Gong.

819
00:48:51,756 --> 00:48:55,101
How long are you going to leave
GOGO Entertainment without a CEO?

820
00:48:55,125 --> 00:48:58,701
Director Yoon's handling things now,
so don't worry too much.

821
00:48:58,725 --> 00:49:00,096
I'll see how things go...

822
00:49:00,625 --> 00:49:03,425
and maybe hire
a management specialist.

823
00:49:03,966 --> 00:49:05,942
Okay, do that.

824
00:49:05,966 --> 00:49:08,181
We don't have any decent candidates.

825
00:49:08,205 --> 00:49:10,366
Ko Pil Seung and Park Do Ra
could've put...

826
00:49:10,366 --> 00:49:12,775
GOGO Entertainment in huge danger.

827
00:49:13,006 --> 00:49:15,382
They say it wasn't true
that she had a sponsor,

828
00:49:15,406 --> 00:49:17,706
but how could he fall
for someone like that?

829
00:49:17,975 --> 00:49:22,115
Anyway, I'm relieved
Ko Pil Seung stepped down as CEO.

830
00:49:23,145 --> 00:49:27,455
Dad, I've never seen a man
as awesome as Pil Seung.

831
00:49:27,455 --> 00:49:29,701
Not even in a romantic novel.

832
00:49:29,725 --> 00:49:31,756
The whole world badmouthed her.

833
00:49:31,756 --> 00:49:34,925
A weirdo would've left her
and ran to save his own skin.

834
00:49:35,466 --> 00:49:37,971
But Pil Seung didn't do that.

835
00:49:37,995 --> 00:49:40,796
He stayed with her
and showed what true love is.

836
00:49:40,796 --> 00:49:42,842
Isn't that a man
you can really trust?

837
00:49:42,866 --> 00:49:45,405
I was so moved by what he did.

838
00:49:48,145 --> 00:49:50,705
But who do you think is
the nasty guy...

839
00:49:50,705 --> 00:49:54,775
who framed Do Ra
in such a nasty way?

840
00:49:55,546 --> 00:49:57,786
A punk like him should die already.

841
00:49:58,386 --> 00:49:59,755
Ma Ri, please.

842
00:50:00,156 --> 00:50:02,302
That is not appropriate to say
at the dinner table.

843
00:50:02,326 --> 00:50:03,355
How so?

844
00:50:03,355 --> 00:50:06,896
What's so wrong about saying
that a punk like him should die?

845
00:50:09,665 --> 00:50:12,665
These are
salt butter rolls, croissants,

846
00:50:12,665 --> 00:50:14,065
and cake rolls with whipped cream.

847
00:50:14,065 --> 00:50:16,605
I stood in line at a top bakery
in the neighborhood...

848
00:50:16,605 --> 00:50:17,906
to get you these.

849
00:50:17,906 --> 00:50:21,076
Goodness. How sweet of you.

850
00:50:21,205 --> 00:50:25,005
Buns and bread
have been my favorites since birth.

851
00:50:25,975 --> 00:50:28,216
I was told
that I woke up instantly...

852
00:50:28,216 --> 00:50:29,915
at the sound of them.

853
00:50:29,915 --> 00:50:31,615
Goodness. Really?

854
00:50:32,886 --> 00:50:34,285
What brings you by?

855
00:50:34,285 --> 00:50:36,556
Always so cold, aren't you?

856
00:50:37,056 --> 00:50:39,625
I had something to give Sang Gu,

857
00:50:39,625 --> 00:50:41,866
so I came by
to greet your mother-in-law too.

858
00:50:41,866 --> 00:50:43,626
As if I'm not welcome here.

859
00:50:43,995 --> 00:50:45,396
By the way,

860
00:50:45,596 --> 00:50:47,266
Ms. Hong,

861
00:50:47,395 --> 00:50:50,666
are you sure
you and our tenant Jin Sang Gu...

862
00:50:50,906 --> 00:50:53,375
are cousins?

863
00:50:53,375 --> 00:50:56,475
Gosh, Mother.
What are you getting at?

864
00:50:56,475 --> 00:51:00,146
Sang Gu is my cousin
on my mother's side.

865
00:51:00,375 --> 00:51:03,346
Right, I see.

866
00:51:04,216 --> 00:51:07,855
I mean, it's just
that you two seemed quite close.

867
00:51:07,855 --> 00:51:09,155
Mother, please.

868
00:51:09,625 --> 00:51:10,756
Anyway, Sun Young,

869
00:51:10,756 --> 00:51:14,655
I heard someone made it look like
your daughter-in-law had a sponsor.

870
00:51:14,966 --> 00:51:16,065
Goodness me.

871
00:51:16,065 --> 00:51:18,442
I'm glad at least that scandal
was proven to be false.

872
00:51:18,466 --> 00:51:21,196
Hey. Who are you calling
my daughter-in-law...

873
00:51:21,196 --> 00:51:22,906
when their wedding was interrupted?

874
00:51:22,906 --> 00:51:25,736
The bride and groom
both walked down the aisle,

875
00:51:25,736 --> 00:51:27,436
so they're as good as married.

876
00:51:27,535 --> 00:51:30,576
I thought she had moved in
to live with you.

877
00:51:30,576 --> 00:51:32,375
What do you mean
she walked down the aisle?

878
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:34,775
It ended before she took her steps.

879
00:51:35,486 --> 00:51:38,285
Anyway, she isn't
my daughter-in-law yet,

880
00:51:38,285 --> 00:51:39,391
so don't call her that.

881
00:51:39,415 --> 00:51:41,986
Then throw them another wedding.

882
00:51:41,986 --> 00:51:44,302
They're both madly in love,

883
00:51:44,326 --> 00:51:46,355
and a love that beautiful is rare.

884
00:51:46,355 --> 00:51:49,125
I can't believe what you're saying.

885
00:51:49,125 --> 00:51:52,895
Look here, Ms. Hong!
Why are you talking about her to us?

886
00:51:52,895 --> 00:51:56,936
You know how her scandal hurt
and upset this family.

887
00:51:57,806 --> 00:52:00,475
She didn't end up with your son...

888
00:52:00,475 --> 00:52:02,006
but with Pil Seung instead,

889
00:52:02,006 --> 00:52:04,776
and now you're happy
to see him in pain.

890
00:52:04,776 --> 00:52:07,776
Did you come here to rub it in
first thing in the morning?

891
00:52:07,776 --> 00:52:09,915
Gosh, no.

892
00:52:09,915 --> 00:52:12,315
If that's what you're going to say,
just leave.

893
00:52:12,315 --> 00:52:13,785
- Leave.
- We don't need any of this,

894
00:52:13,785 --> 00:52:15,256
- so take this with you!
- But...

895
00:52:15,256 --> 00:52:16,256
Sun Young,

896
00:52:16,256 --> 00:52:18,395
I found the love between Pil Seung
and your daughter-in-law...

897
00:52:18,395 --> 00:52:19,725
to be admirable.

898
00:52:19,725 --> 00:52:21,455
That was me being in awe.

899
00:52:21,455 --> 00:52:24,125
- Anyway, I'll get going.
- Take those with you.

900
00:52:24,125 --> 00:52:25,596
Don't get the wrong idea.

901
00:52:25,596 --> 00:52:26,995
Please have these though.

902
00:52:26,995 --> 00:52:28,782
- Seriously.
- Have a good day.

903
00:52:28,806 --> 00:52:30,466
- My gosh.
- Unbelievable.

904
00:52:30,466 --> 00:52:32,035
Sun Young.

905
00:52:32,035 --> 00:52:34,375
Sun Young,
I can't take either of them.

906
00:52:34,375 --> 00:52:36,506
He needs to leave. Throw him out!

907
00:52:36,506 --> 00:52:39,515
Both of them have lost their minds.

908
00:52:39,515 --> 00:52:41,275
Are you kidding me?

909
00:52:42,946 --> 00:52:44,286
Sang Gu.

910
00:52:44,585 --> 00:52:47,716
It seems as though
Pil Seung's grandmother...

911
00:52:47,716 --> 00:52:49,656
doesn't believe we're cousins.

912
00:52:49,656 --> 00:52:52,256
I think it'll be best for you
to live elsewhere.

913
00:52:52,256 --> 00:52:54,355
She could tell Jin Dan about this...

914
00:52:54,355 --> 00:52:56,871
and that keeps me up at night.

915
00:52:56,895 --> 00:52:57,895
Fine.

916
00:52:57,895 --> 00:53:00,835
That old lady sticks her nose
in my business...

917
00:53:00,835 --> 00:53:02,065
and always gives me her opinion.

918
00:53:02,065 --> 00:53:04,905
She was getting on my nerves,
so I was about to leave anyway.

919
00:53:06,435 --> 00:53:07,851
Ae Kyo.

920
00:53:07,875 --> 00:53:10,676
Why don't we go for a drive...

921
00:53:10,676 --> 00:53:12,445
and have dakgalbi too?

922
00:53:12,776 --> 00:53:15,985
Maybe we should. I love it.

923
00:53:17,315 --> 00:53:19,455
Jin Sang Gu, you and I should talk.

924
00:53:19,455 --> 00:53:20,455
Jin Sang Gu...

925
00:53:20,455 --> 00:53:21,956
Goodness.

926
00:53:23,355 --> 00:53:26,225
What did I just see?

927
00:53:26,225 --> 00:53:28,926
Why were cousins hugging like that?

928
00:53:28,926 --> 00:53:30,826
Gosh, that's nasty.

929
00:53:30,826 --> 00:53:33,266
No, we're not cousins.

930
00:53:33,366 --> 00:53:34,666
What?

931
00:53:34,696 --> 00:53:37,442
But you said he was your cousin.

932
00:53:37,466 --> 00:53:40,376
We're not. Let me correct that.

933
00:53:40,676 --> 00:53:43,905
You see, we're not cousins.

934
00:53:44,145 --> 00:53:45,491
We're dating.

935
00:53:45,515 --> 00:53:49,346
What? You're dating?

936
00:53:49,886 --> 00:53:51,116
Look here.

937
00:53:51,116 --> 00:53:53,516
You said
you recently met your first love.

938
00:53:54,256 --> 00:53:55,925
Was it her?

939
00:54:07,136 --> 00:54:08,765
I had no idea,

940
00:54:08,765 --> 00:54:11,535
but my first love
who I dated back then...

941
00:54:11,535 --> 00:54:13,876
had and raised my son.

942
00:54:14,035 --> 00:54:15,775
I just found out.

943
00:54:21,745 --> 00:54:24,545
Hold on. Could it be...

944
00:54:25,616 --> 00:54:27,356
Is CEO Gong...

945
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:31,286
Sang Gu's son?

946
00:54:31,955 --> 00:54:33,255
What...

947
00:54:34,696 --> 00:54:36,196
No, wait.

948
00:54:36,196 --> 00:54:38,666
He said he didn't have a son.

949
00:54:40,035 --> 00:54:42,706
What on earth am I thinking?

950
00:54:54,616 --> 00:54:55,915
Jjajangmyeon sounds good.

951
00:54:55,915 --> 00:54:58,385
- What about you?
- Jjajangmyeon sounds nice.

952
00:54:59,855 --> 00:55:01,356
Is that Park Do Ra?

953
00:55:01,855 --> 00:55:05,025
Is she already out and about
now that she cleared her name?

954
00:55:05,326 --> 00:55:06,955
How shameless is she?

955
00:55:06,955 --> 00:55:08,156
Tell me about it.

956
00:55:08,156 --> 00:55:09,995
Judging by how she is,

957
00:55:09,995 --> 00:55:12,065
she'll soon take on acting jobs too.

958
00:55:12,065 --> 00:55:14,935
As if we'll think of anything else
but her sponsorship scandal.

959
00:55:14,935 --> 00:55:16,365
Tell me about it.

960
00:55:17,265 --> 00:55:18,676
Look here, Park Do Ra.

961
00:55:18,676 --> 00:55:20,476
I mean, Kim Ji Young.

962
00:55:20,535 --> 00:55:22,846
What are we supposed to call her?

963
00:55:23,546 --> 00:55:26,315
Whatever your name is,
don't go back to acting.

964
00:55:26,475 --> 00:55:30,116
You changed your face
and deceived the entire nation,

965
00:55:30,116 --> 00:55:32,255
so how can you be an actress?

966
00:55:32,355 --> 00:55:33,986
It isn't educational
for children to see someone...

967
00:55:33,986 --> 00:55:35,925
who was caught up
in a sponsorship scandal.

968
00:55:38,895 --> 00:55:40,255
Her name...

969
00:55:40,725 --> 00:55:43,465
was cleared regarding that scandal.

970
00:55:49,866 --> 00:55:51,166
She was framed,

971
00:55:51,435 --> 00:55:53,335
and she has been suffering
because of it.

972
00:55:53,335 --> 00:55:56,476
So, please don't say that about her.

973
00:55:57,406 --> 00:55:58,876
Please.

974
00:56:05,185 --> 00:56:06,516
Do Ra.

975
00:56:10,326 --> 00:56:11,655
Do Ra.

976
00:56:15,966 --> 00:56:17,266
Pil Seung.

977
00:56:18,665 --> 00:56:21,596
I thought people would forgive me
after I cleared my name.

978
00:56:22,236 --> 00:56:23,835
Because I'm innocent.

979
00:56:24,335 --> 00:56:27,106
I thought
people would care about the truth.

980
00:56:28,576 --> 00:56:30,076
But they don't.

981
00:56:31,705 --> 00:56:34,745
They still see me as an actress
who had a sponsor...

982
00:56:34,745 --> 00:56:36,215
and also a fraud.

983
00:56:37,085 --> 00:56:39,815
I have the scarlet letter
that can't be erased.

984
00:56:41,685 --> 00:56:43,056
Do Ra.

985
00:56:43,585 --> 00:56:44,985
It's not like...

986
00:56:45,296 --> 00:56:48,026
It's not like
I was at a department store...

987
00:56:48,026 --> 00:56:49,526
or an amusement park.

988
00:56:49,526 --> 00:56:51,766
I was grocery shopping!

989
00:56:52,196 --> 00:56:54,596
Can I not even buy
some ramyeon in peace?

990
00:56:55,065 --> 00:56:57,835
Do I have to stay home forever?

991
00:57:00,906 --> 00:57:03,246
Of course not.

992
00:57:03,946 --> 00:57:07,476
Even the most innocent actors
have haters.

993
00:57:08,076 --> 00:57:11,445
They're hated
for no particular reason.

994
00:57:11,846 --> 00:57:14,416
All you need is time.

995
00:57:15,386 --> 00:57:19,626
I believe that time will cure all.

996
00:57:20,556 --> 00:57:23,826
Do Ra, it's all right.

997
00:57:26,236 --> 00:57:28,666
Will it get better, Pil Seung?

998
00:57:29,966 --> 00:57:31,306
Of course.

999
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:33,335
It'll be all right.

1000
00:57:41,145 --> 00:57:44,585
What? What did you say?

1001
00:57:45,245 --> 00:57:47,056
You need more money?

1002
00:57:47,085 --> 00:57:48,161
Ae Kyo,

1003
00:57:48,185 --> 00:57:51,101
I never wanted to ask you
for money again,

1004
00:57:51,125 --> 00:57:52,502
but it's urgent.

1005
00:57:52,526 --> 00:57:54,225
Sang Gu, come on.

1006
00:57:54,225 --> 00:57:56,626
Why are you bringing your
money problems to me?

1007
00:57:56,725 --> 00:57:59,865
This attitude of yours
is putting me off.

1008
00:58:00,065 --> 00:58:01,265
Ae Kyo, I'm sorry,

1009
00:58:01,265 --> 00:58:04,166
but could you help me out
this one last time?

1010
00:58:04,466 --> 00:58:08,076
Wait. Are you dating me...

1011
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,746
for my money?

1012
00:58:10,306 --> 00:58:13,822
Was Jin Dan right
to call you a gold digger?

1013
00:58:13,846 --> 00:58:15,945
A gold digger? Of course not.

1014
00:58:16,616 --> 00:58:19,856
I'm in this mess
because I wanted to help Jin Dan,

1015
00:58:20,185 --> 00:58:23,085
so how could you say that to me?

1016
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:24,425
Jin Dan?

1017
00:58:24,855 --> 00:58:27,826
Why would you bring him up
in this conversation?

1018
00:58:29,265 --> 00:58:30,666
I am...

1019
00:58:32,565 --> 00:58:34,266
I'm in trouble.

1020
00:58:35,236 --> 00:58:37,335
Trouble? What kind of trouble?

1021
00:58:38,676 --> 00:58:40,806
The accident involving
Chairman Gong's daughter.

1022
00:58:43,205 --> 00:58:45,005
I was behind that.

1023
00:58:45,145 --> 00:58:47,116
What?

1024
00:58:47,116 --> 00:58:50,115
You're the one
who caused Ma Ri's accident?

1025
00:58:50,185 --> 00:58:51,185
Yes.

1026
00:58:51,185 --> 00:58:52,856
Are you out of your mind?

1027
00:58:54,315 --> 00:58:56,056
Why would you do
something like that?

1028
00:58:56,056 --> 00:58:57,826
How could you?

1029
00:58:57,826 --> 00:59:01,755
You told me
she was in Jin Dan's way.

1030
00:59:02,326 --> 00:59:04,925
I tried to take her out,

1031
00:59:05,535 --> 00:59:08,335
but Ko Pil Seung
took the hit instead.

1032
00:59:10,035 --> 00:59:12,035
I don't know if it was for the best,
but my plan failed.

1033
00:59:12,035 --> 00:59:13,436
Stop.

1034
00:59:15,136 --> 00:59:18,076
How could you even think
of hurting Ma Ri?

1035
00:59:18,406 --> 00:59:20,291
You're out of your mind!

1036
00:59:20,315 --> 00:59:21,875
You told me...

1037
00:59:21,875 --> 00:59:24,286
the family treated you
and Jin Dan poorly,

1038
00:59:24,815 --> 00:59:26,686
and I saw red.

1039
00:59:26,785 --> 00:59:28,032
Ae Kyo,

1040
00:59:28,056 --> 00:59:31,826
I wanted to help him
in some capacity.

1041
00:59:32,596 --> 00:59:34,726
Because I lacked in so many ways,

1042
00:59:35,056 --> 00:59:36,965
I couldn't do anything for my son.

1043
00:59:37,065 --> 00:59:40,835
And I don't have the power
to give him a better future.

1044
00:59:40,995 --> 00:59:42,865
That's why I did it.

1045
00:59:43,265 --> 00:59:45,535
Why do you need the money though?

1046
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:47,076
What is it for?

1047
00:59:48,875 --> 00:59:52,005
I couldn't drive the car myself,

1048
00:59:52,216 --> 00:59:55,175
so I hired someone to do it instead.

1049
00:59:55,645 --> 00:59:58,545
I gave him all the money
you last gave me.

1050
00:59:59,185 --> 01:00:02,185
It looks like someone's onto him.

1051
01:00:02,185 --> 01:00:03,826
He wants to leave the country.

1052
01:00:04,285 --> 01:00:05,755
Oh, no.

1053
01:00:06,125 --> 01:00:08,101
If he gets caught, I'll get caught.

1054
01:00:08,125 --> 01:00:11,096
That won't be good
for you or for Jin Dan,

1055
01:00:11,826 --> 01:00:15,195
so I want to get him to go abroad.

1056
01:00:16,435 --> 01:00:20,576
But that takes a lot of money.

1057
01:00:22,245 --> 01:00:24,106
A lot? How much?

1058
01:00:26,415 --> 01:00:30,286
Mom, did you just say
500,000 dollars?

1059
01:00:30,546 --> 01:00:34,261
Jin Dan, I need it
urgently and fast.

1060
01:00:34,285 --> 01:00:35,532
Give me 500,000 dollars.

1061
01:00:35,556 --> 01:00:37,956
No, lend it to me.

1062
01:00:38,125 --> 01:00:39,971
You can do that, can't you?

1063
01:00:39,995 --> 01:00:42,641
I could lend it to you
or even give it to you.

1064
01:00:42,665 --> 01:00:43,895
Could you really?

1065
01:00:43,895 --> 01:00:47,235
But why do you suddenly need
that much money?

1066
01:00:47,535 --> 01:00:50,482
- What is it for?
- Don't ask such questions.

1067
01:00:50,506 --> 01:00:53,112
I got into a bit of trouble.

1068
01:00:53,136 --> 01:00:54,476
Trouble?

1069
01:00:54,736 --> 01:00:56,621
- What kind of trouble?
- Gong Jin Dan.

1070
01:00:56,645 --> 01:00:58,282
I'll pay you back.

1071
01:00:58,306 --> 01:00:59,846
I'll pay you interest if you want.

1072
01:00:59,846 --> 01:01:01,715
I'll repay the principal too.

1073
01:01:12,696 --> 01:01:15,066
(Pureum Bank)

1074
01:01:25,366 --> 01:01:27,536
It's 500,000 dollars.

1075
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:31,806
Be sure the punk goes abroad
immediately, okay?

1076
01:01:31,975 --> 01:01:33,346
Sure. Don't worry.

1077
01:01:33,546 --> 01:01:37,346
He said he'd leave tomorrow
if he got the money.

1078
01:01:39,315 --> 01:01:40,985
Seriously, Mom?

1079
01:01:42,056 --> 01:01:43,755
I knew it.

1080
01:01:43,826 --> 01:01:46,796
I knew
the money would go to this moron.

1081
01:01:46,796 --> 01:01:48,572
Jin Dan.

1082
01:01:48,596 --> 01:01:51,701
You punk, you still say
you're not a leech?

1083
01:01:51,725 --> 01:01:53,266
You're not a fraud?

1084
01:01:55,296 --> 01:01:57,911
Stop it, Jin Dan.
What are you doing?

1085
01:01:57,935 --> 01:01:59,552
Come here, you leech.

1086
01:01:59,576 --> 01:02:02,851
You punk, I'll make you pay
this time.

1087
01:02:02,875 --> 01:02:05,346
I'll get you locked up...

1088
01:02:05,406 --> 01:02:07,846
for habitual extortion
and blackmail.

1089
01:02:07,875 --> 01:02:09,585
I'll kill you, you punk!

1090
01:02:09,585 --> 01:02:10,886
No, Jin Dan.

1091
01:02:10,886 --> 01:02:13,715
He's your dad.

1092
01:02:16,955 --> 01:02:18,286
Mom.

1093
01:02:18,926 --> 01:02:20,996
What are you saying?

1094
01:02:21,326 --> 01:02:23,396
Who are you calling my dad?

1095
01:02:23,426 --> 01:02:25,596
How could he be my dad?

1096
01:02:26,395 --> 01:02:27,871
Are you out of your mind?

1097
01:02:27,895 --> 01:02:29,206
Jin Dan.

1098
01:02:29,806 --> 01:02:31,265
He's really your dad.

1099
01:02:31,265 --> 01:02:33,782
He's your birth dad.
He gave you life.

1100
01:02:33,806 --> 01:02:35,522
So stop hitting him.

1101
01:02:35,546 --> 01:02:37,205
Don't assault him.

1102
01:02:37,205 --> 01:02:38,976
Don't, Jin Dan.

1103
01:02:41,176 --> 01:02:42,476
Mom.

1104
01:02:43,346 --> 01:02:46,815
How can you say something
so crazy so calmly?

1105
01:02:48,515 --> 01:02:49,885
No, right?

1106
01:02:50,426 --> 01:02:52,085
It's not true, is it?

1107
01:02:52,895 --> 01:02:55,326
What kind of nonsense is this?

1108
01:02:56,265 --> 01:02:57,466
Yes, Vice President.

1109
01:02:57,466 --> 01:02:59,966
(Chairman Gong Jin Taek)

1110
01:03:00,765 --> 01:03:02,135
What?

1111
01:03:02,265 --> 01:03:04,806
You found the man
who tried to hurt Ma Ri?

1112
01:03:07,705 --> 01:03:09,005
Okay.

1113
01:03:10,576 --> 01:03:11,876
I got it.

1114
01:03:34,435 --> 01:03:36,106
Why did you do it?

1115
01:03:36,406 --> 01:03:38,365
Why did you try to kill my daughter?

1116
01:03:39,975 --> 01:03:43,905
You drove at her on purpose.

1117
01:03:44,375 --> 01:03:45,546
You tried to kill her!

1118
01:03:45,546 --> 01:03:47,876
I'm sorry! I shouldn't have.

1119
01:03:49,785 --> 01:03:51,615
Someone told me to do it.

1120
01:03:52,415 --> 01:03:54,356
He offered to pay me
to kill your daughter.

1121
01:03:55,185 --> 01:03:56,556
What?

1122
01:03:57,256 --> 01:03:59,085
Someone put you up to it?

1123
01:04:00,796 --> 01:04:04,326
I wanted to study,
but I couldn't afford to.

1124
01:04:04,796 --> 01:04:06,865
I did it for the money.

1125
01:04:07,796 --> 01:04:09,536
I did what the guy told me to.

1126
01:04:10,665 --> 01:04:12,065
"The guy?"

1127
01:04:13,136 --> 01:04:14,635
Who is that guy?

1128
01:04:14,935 --> 01:04:16,675
Who told you to do it?

1129
01:04:17,946 --> 01:04:20,775
Jin Sang Gu. He told me to do it.

1130
01:04:21,616 --> 01:04:23,146
Jin Sang Gu?

1131
01:04:24,216 --> 01:04:25,985
Who's Jin Sang Gu?

1132
01:04:28,056 --> 01:04:30,955
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1133
01:05:03,085 --> 01:05:04,625
Actresses are all about their image.

1134
01:05:04,625 --> 01:05:06,361
Who would hire Park Do Ra now?

1135
01:05:06,385 --> 01:05:07,956
I don't think she can come back.

1136
01:05:07,956 --> 01:05:10,656
We can't just sit around
and suck our fingers.

1137
01:05:10,995 --> 01:05:14,772
And we shouldn't let
Grandma's recipe go to waste.

1138
01:05:14,796 --> 01:05:16,366
Let's give it a go.

1139
01:05:16,436 --> 01:05:18,042
How is he my father?

1140
01:05:18,066 --> 01:05:21,066
He asks you for money all the time.
How is that a father?

1141
01:05:21,066 --> 01:05:23,212
Do you know
what Sang Gu did for you?

1142
01:05:23,236 --> 01:05:26,082
He definitely wanted Ma Ri dead.

1143
01:05:26,106 --> 01:05:27,281
What for?

1144
01:05:27,305 --> 01:05:28,445
He ran away?

1145
01:05:28,445 --> 01:05:31,015
Yes, I went over there
and the place was empty.

1146
01:05:31,015 --> 01:05:33,715
Jin Sang Gu packed and left
without us knowing.

1147
01:05:33,715 --> 01:05:35,591
Why did you call me here this late?

1148
01:05:35,615 --> 01:05:37,415
The drivers are all off work.

1149
01:05:38,486 --> 01:05:39,826
Jin Taek.
