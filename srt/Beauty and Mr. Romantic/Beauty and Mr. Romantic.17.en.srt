00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:07,329
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

2
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:10,748
(Episode 17)

3
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:15,118
Where's the child actor?

4
00:00:15,365 --> 00:00:16,514
Didn't you request one?

5
00:00:16,538 --> 00:00:17,819
Just a second, Director Ko.

6
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:19,789
- Ji Young.
- Yes?

7
00:00:21,538 --> 00:00:22,658
Where's the child actor?

8
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:24,629
Are you sure you called the agency?

9
00:00:24,849 --> 00:00:26,149
Check how far out they are.

10
00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:27,178
Sorry?

11
00:00:27,178 --> 00:00:29,068
Isn't the child actor
filming tomorrow?

12
00:00:29,618 --> 00:00:30,929
What are you talking about?

13
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:33,499
The child actor
is in today's scenes.

14
00:00:34,588 --> 00:00:35,969
Did you tell them
that it was tomorrow?

15
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,298
Yes, I thought the child
was needed on Wednesday,

16
00:00:41,298 --> 00:00:42,778
so I told them to come tomorrow.

17
00:00:44,158 --> 00:00:45,318
Assistant Director!

18
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:46,918
Are you kidding me?

19
00:00:47,499 --> 00:00:50,348
A job this important
shouldn't have gone to the newbie!

20
00:00:51,168 --> 00:00:53,368
And even if you did
delegate the task,

21
00:00:53,368 --> 00:00:55,028
you should've checked.

22
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:57,159
Well, I...

23
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:01,129
I'll call the agency right away.

24
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:02,618
What good will that do?

25
00:01:02,618 --> 00:01:03,878
Are we supposed to wait all day
for the child actor...

26
00:01:03,878 --> 00:01:05,168
who lives out of town to get here?

27
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,369
How can you make
such an elementary mistake?

28
00:01:07,918 --> 00:01:10,509
Forget it. We're not filming today.

29
00:01:19,928 --> 00:01:22,219
Assistant Director, I apologize.

30
00:01:23,169 --> 00:01:25,019
I caused huge trouble for you.

31
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:26,818
Forget it.

32
00:01:31,178 --> 00:01:33,499
Goodness. What do I do?

33
00:01:33,949 --> 00:01:37,698
You idiot.
What kind of mess did you cause?

34
00:01:39,219 --> 00:01:40,398
Gosh.

35
00:01:43,919 --> 00:01:46,239
Director Ko!

36
00:01:51,798 --> 00:01:53,618
Director Ko, I'm terribly sorry,

37
00:01:54,499 --> 00:01:58,458
but what happened today
is entirely on me.

38
00:01:58,908 --> 00:02:00,859
The assistant director
did nothing wrong.

39
00:02:01,878 --> 00:02:03,629
I mixed up the dates.

40
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,058
I'm really sorry, sir.

41
00:02:08,548 --> 00:02:10,368
Mixing up the dates is one thing,

42
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:14,139
but you would've figured it out
if you had checked today's schedule.

43
00:02:14,758 --> 00:02:16,539
Didn't you check?

44
00:02:16,658 --> 00:02:18,408
How is that a professional attitude?

45
00:02:20,788 --> 00:02:21,908
Forget it.

46
00:02:27,999 --> 00:02:29,989
I'm a complete idiot.

47
00:02:31,908 --> 00:02:34,019
What should I do now?

48
00:02:52,728 --> 00:02:54,609
Let me see.

49
00:03:02,038 --> 00:03:03,118
Ms. Kim.

50
00:03:04,168 --> 00:03:05,558
Why are you still here at this hour?

51
00:03:07,408 --> 00:03:08,588
Well...

52
00:03:10,339 --> 00:03:11,658
You see...

53
00:03:12,608 --> 00:03:14,699
I didn't want to make
another mistake,

54
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:18,938
so I stayed back to confirm that
we had all the props for tomorrow.

55
00:03:20,418 --> 00:03:22,739
Anyway,
I was just about to head home.

56
00:03:24,089 --> 00:03:25,579
Sure. See you tomorrow.

57
00:03:25,828 --> 00:03:27,808
Right. Have a good evening.

58
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:30,208
Hold on.

59
00:03:31,198 --> 00:03:33,299
There aren't any buses or trains
at this hour.

60
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:34,369
How are you going to get home?

61
00:03:34,369 --> 00:03:37,239
Oh, that? I can take a taxi.

62
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:38,419
Where do you live?

63
00:03:39,168 --> 00:03:40,558
In Heukseok-dong.

64
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:42,928
Let's head out together.
I'll drop you off.

65
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:44,389
Sorry?

66
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:48,549
Gosh. Gosh, no.

67
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:50,249
It's all right.

68
00:03:50,249 --> 00:03:52,589
You must be tired enough,

69
00:03:52,589 --> 00:03:55,438
so I don't want to put you out
by having you go the other way.

70
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:56,989
I wouldn't be going the other way.

71
00:03:56,989 --> 00:03:58,308
I live in that neighborhood too.

72
00:03:58,559 --> 00:04:01,189
It'd be weird of me
to go off on my own...

73
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:02,378
when knowing you live close by.

74
00:04:02,899 --> 00:04:04,408
Gather your things already.

75
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:08,789
I see we live
in the same neighborhood.

76
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:13,158
Why would he offer me a ride
out of the blue?

77
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:17,928
Coming.

78
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:29,308
Director Ko,

79
00:04:29,888 --> 00:04:31,138
I...

80
00:04:31,258 --> 00:04:34,178
I'm truly sorry
about what happened earlier.

81
00:04:35,929 --> 00:04:39,779
From now on, I won't make
a mistake like that again.

82
00:04:40,568 --> 00:04:42,549
So please don't fire me.

83
00:04:45,609 --> 00:04:48,089
You see, I...

84
00:04:49,078 --> 00:04:51,409
I told everyone back home...

85
00:04:51,409 --> 00:04:54,448
that I got a job
at a broadcasting station.

86
00:04:54,448 --> 00:04:57,078
My neighbors have been
congratulating me...

87
00:04:57,078 --> 00:04:59,669
for making it big as a city girl.

88
00:05:00,549 --> 00:05:02,289
Going home after being fired...

89
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:05,039
will make me want
to hide in embarrassment forever.

90
00:05:07,659 --> 00:05:09,008
Were you worried
about getting fired?

91
00:05:09,628 --> 00:05:10,678
Yes.

92
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:14,219
I know I made a huge mistake.

93
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:18,919
Never will I make
a mistake like that again.

94
00:05:19,869 --> 00:05:22,008
So please...

95
00:05:22,008 --> 00:05:25,558
Please be generous
and forgive me this once.

96
00:05:27,109 --> 00:05:29,368
All right. I won't fire you,

97
00:05:29,718 --> 00:05:31,368
so don't stay after hours this late.

98
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,068
Do you mean that?

99
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,878
Gosh, thank you so much.

100
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:42,808
I won't forget
how you offered me this job.

101
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:45,669
I'll give everything I have...

102
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:48,518
and do the best that I can.

103
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:58,599
Where do you live?

104
00:05:59,508 --> 00:06:01,278
I live way over there.

105
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,979
You can drop me off here.

106
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:04,619
If you drive me up there,

107
00:06:04,619 --> 00:06:06,239
you won't be able
to turn your car around.

108
00:06:07,888 --> 00:06:10,768
Director Ko, I appreciate this.

109
00:06:11,758 --> 00:06:14,078
Coffee will be on me tomorrow.

110
00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:17,059
It's all right,
so head home and rest.

111
00:06:17,059 --> 00:06:20,518
Sure. Get home safely then.

112
00:06:26,809 --> 00:06:28,289
Have a pleasant night.

113
00:06:40,148 --> 00:06:41,268
Hold on.

114
00:06:43,588 --> 00:06:44,979
- Me?
- Yes.

115
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:47,779
What do you want?

116
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:51,109
How about we go on a date?

117
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:53,229
What did you just say?

118
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:54,678
I asked you out on a date.

119
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:56,649
You crazy man.

120
00:06:56,768 --> 00:06:59,289
Why would I date
a complete stranger?

121
00:06:59,338 --> 00:07:01,208
Cut the nonsense,

122
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:03,585
head home, wash your feet,
and go to bed.

123
00:07:03,609 --> 00:07:04,659
What the...

124
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:07,529
My being nice
isn't a reason to look down on me.

125
00:07:08,278 --> 00:07:10,119
- You hillbilly.
- What?

126
00:07:10,119 --> 00:07:12,249
You should be grateful
to date a man like me,

127
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:13,868
so who are you to play hard to get?

128
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:15,368
You're coming with me.

129
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:19,028
What? What the...
What are you doing?

130
00:07:19,028 --> 00:07:20,239
Let go of me.

131
00:07:20,758 --> 00:07:22,475
Let go of me, you jerk.

132
00:07:22,499 --> 00:07:25,678
What the... Let go of me, you jerk.

133
00:07:26,268 --> 00:07:28,198
Let go, you piece of trash.

134
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,968
Let go while I ask nicely.

135
00:07:29,968 --> 00:07:31,818
- Why you...
- Hey, mister!

136
00:07:32,638 --> 00:07:34,219
You're dead meat today.

137
00:07:40,109 --> 00:07:41,399
Director Ko, my gosh.

138
00:07:43,078 --> 00:07:45,448
Ms. Kim, are you all right?
Weren't you hurt?

139
00:07:45,448 --> 00:07:48,119
Yes, I'm all right.

140
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:49,289
What was that about?

141
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:50,938
Do you know that guy?

142
00:07:51,218 --> 00:07:53,878
No, he's a complete stranger.

143
00:07:54,088 --> 00:07:55,975
I was walking home...

144
00:07:55,999 --> 00:07:59,719
when that fool asked to date me
and tried to drag me off.

145
00:07:59,828 --> 00:08:01,818
He tried to hit me too,

146
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:03,719
so I kicked his family jewels.

147
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:09,159
Director Ko.
Is this the kind of place Seoul is?

148
00:08:10,278 --> 00:08:12,558
Is it this scary a place?

149
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,799
What are you doing here, anyway?

150
00:08:20,948 --> 00:08:24,039
Oh. You left your phone in my car.

151
00:08:25,028 --> 00:08:26,109
Oh, dear.

152
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:28,078
I'm so scatterbrained.

153
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:31,248
I'm sorry, Director Ko.

154
00:08:31,828 --> 00:08:34,939
I made you
come back here because of this.

155
00:08:34,939 --> 00:08:37,118
No, it's fine.

156
00:08:37,439 --> 00:08:39,419
I'm sorry to say this,

157
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:43,128
but I'm glad
I left my phone in your car.

158
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,948
If you hadn't come over,

159
00:08:45,948 --> 00:08:48,424
something terrible
could've happened to me.

160
00:08:48,448 --> 00:08:50,699
You came back to give me this...

161
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:52,839
and saved me from harm.

162
00:08:53,988 --> 00:08:55,538
Thank you so much.

163
00:08:56,718 --> 00:08:58,439
I thought of saying this earlier,

164
00:08:59,088 --> 00:09:01,609
but this area is too out-of-the-way
and dangerous for you to walk alone.

165
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,449
Why not find another place to stay?

166
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:05,248
I'm looking for...

167
00:09:05,728 --> 00:09:07,648
a place to move to...

168
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:10,319
once I settle in at my job.

169
00:09:10,868 --> 00:09:12,608
Grandma said
she'd come live with me.

170
00:09:12,608 --> 00:09:14,258
Good. Find another place.

171
00:09:16,108 --> 00:09:17,158
Go on inside.

172
00:09:17,409 --> 00:09:19,599
I'll stand watch
until you're indoors.

173
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:20,829
Go on.

174
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,519
Okay. Thank you.

175
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:26,538
Oh, do you have my number?

176
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:28,868
Yes, I do.

177
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,969
Call if something's wrong.

178
00:09:31,318 --> 00:09:34,839
Thanks so much, Director Ko.

179
00:09:35,698 --> 00:09:38,418
I'll never forget
what you did for me.

180
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:49,639
(Deposit 1,100, Rent 1,100)

181
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:50,639
(Deposit 650, Rent 650)

182
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,699
My gosh.

183
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,798
Why is rent so expensive?

184
00:09:55,118 --> 00:09:56,229
Goodness.

185
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:00,398
Of all these places,
there's no place for me?

186
00:10:06,088 --> 00:10:07,739
Good morning, Director Ko.

187
00:10:09,198 --> 00:10:10,979
- Ji Young.
- Yes?

188
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:12,648
Did you find a place to stay?

189
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:15,118
No.

190
00:10:15,468 --> 00:10:18,689
I'm looking,
but the rent is so expensive.

191
00:10:20,608 --> 00:10:23,459
There isn't a place in Seoul
where I can live.

192
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:26,929
I know a place.
Would you like to take a look?

193
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:29,528
A place you know?

194
00:10:30,549 --> 00:10:32,268
- I'm out of breath.
- Go inside.

195
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,508
My goodness.

196
00:10:39,488 --> 00:10:40,538
Gosh.

197
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,418
Do you like the place?

198
00:10:45,568 --> 00:10:48,248
Yes. I like it so much.

199
00:10:48,738 --> 00:10:51,388
The sun shines right in too.

200
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:55,788
You'll lease such a nice place to us
for so low a price?

201
00:10:56,139 --> 00:11:00,229
I think the owners
are all nice people.

202
00:11:00,578 --> 00:11:02,779
Thank you so much.

203
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:06,239
I'm leasing it to you
because Pil Seung asked me to.

204
00:11:06,948 --> 00:11:08,908
You work on his team?

205
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:10,239
"Pil Seung?"

206
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:14,179
Is this Director Ko's home?

207
00:11:14,588 --> 00:11:17,778
Yes. Director Ko is my son.

208
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:21,719
- Gosh. Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

209
00:11:21,998 --> 00:11:25,559
I had no idea this was his place.

210
00:11:26,468 --> 00:11:29,089
He's such a nice person.

211
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:32,248
You raised your son well.

212
00:11:32,248 --> 00:11:33,829
Oh, goodness.

213
00:11:34,108 --> 00:11:35,578
I promise to...

214
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:37,998
be quiet and keep this place clean.

215
00:11:38,988 --> 00:11:42,439
So, when can we move in?

216
00:11:43,189 --> 00:11:46,609
You can move in today if you want.
The place is empty.

217
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:49,498
I heard you live in
a dangerous area.

218
00:11:49,498 --> 00:11:51,648
Don't stay there. Move in today.

219
00:11:52,669 --> 00:11:55,489
Okay. Thank you.

220
00:11:56,169 --> 00:11:59,115
- Thanks so much.
- Sure.

221
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:01,708
- I'll leave you to look around.
- Okay.

222
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,189
- Bye.
- Thanks.

223
00:12:03,309 --> 00:12:04,658
My gosh.

224
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:09,298
- It's lovely here, Grandma.
- It is.

225
00:12:10,218 --> 00:12:12,239
The director's a real angel.

226
00:12:12,488 --> 00:12:15,218
He gave me a job
when I had no experience,

227
00:12:15,218 --> 00:12:17,469
and he even found me
a place to stay.

228
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:23,449
My gosh. How did she manage
to bring all this?

229
00:12:23,828 --> 00:12:27,048
Someone loves her granddaughter
so very much.

230
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:29,989
The shrimp and crab marinated
in soy sauce are delicious.

231
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:31,639
You could eat heaps of rice.

232
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:33,559
Yes. It's that good.

233
00:12:34,939 --> 00:12:38,158
The young lady who moved in.

234
00:12:38,338 --> 00:12:40,229
She looks oddly familiar.

235
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:41,798
I think I saw her somewhere.

236
00:12:42,578 --> 00:12:45,318
How would you know someone
who lived by the sea?

237
00:12:45,318 --> 00:12:46,924
This is her first time in Seoul.

238
00:12:46,948 --> 00:12:49,439
I'm sure I saw her before.

239
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,809
Sun Young, have you seen her before?

240
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:57,179
I don't think so.
She's a stranger to me.

241
00:13:02,994 --> 00:13:05,115
(Joongmoo Store)

242
00:13:05,408 --> 00:13:07,657
Director Ko, this place would work.

243
00:13:08,408 --> 00:13:11,053
It's deserted because the place
will be redeveloped.

244
00:13:11,077 --> 00:13:13,127
It looks gloomy and spooky enough.

245
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:15,928
Okay. Let's film here.

246
00:13:15,977 --> 00:13:17,027
- Okay.
- Sure.

247
00:13:17,678 --> 00:13:18,767
Hey.

248
00:13:19,447 --> 00:13:20,738
It's Park Do Ra.

249
00:13:22,188 --> 00:13:24,308
Yes. It's Park Do Ra.

250
00:13:31,558 --> 00:13:34,047

253
00:13:47,607 --> 00:13:49,297
I don't think
I ever watched this series.

254
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:51,778
("Straightforward Romance")

255
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:54,198
Gosh. For some reason,

256
00:13:54,548 --> 00:13:56,968
the title hits close to home.

257
00:13:58,188 --> 00:13:59,708
Did I watch it...

258
00:13:59,827 --> 00:14:02,208
but can't remember
because of my amnesia?

259
00:14:09,138 --> 00:14:11,287
Let's have a look.

260
00:14:12,168 --> 00:14:14,017
Cha Bong Soo was in it.

261
00:14:33,158 --> 00:14:36,308
("Straightforward Romance")

262
00:14:48,438 --> 00:14:49,558
"Hey."

263
00:14:50,038 --> 00:14:52,157
"Why must we break up
when we're in love?"

264
00:14:56,548 --> 00:14:58,797
"I will love you
even if you don't love me back."

265
00:15:03,058 --> 00:15:06,108
"I'll head straight for you."

266
00:15:17,268 --> 00:15:18,318
Oh, gosh.

267
00:15:23,438 --> 00:15:25,778
- Do Ra.
- No.

268
00:15:25,778 --> 00:15:27,397
That was nothing.

269
00:15:27,707 --> 00:15:30,297
I happened to
come across a script...

270
00:15:30,617 --> 00:15:32,648
and it was so fun,

271
00:15:32,648 --> 00:15:35,637
I got really into it
and became all emotional.

272
00:15:35,817 --> 00:15:37,708
Before I knew it,

273
00:15:39,227 --> 00:15:41,238
I was acting, I guess.

274
00:15:45,367 --> 00:15:49,247
Your name's on the script too.

275
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:52,017
Did you work on
"Straightforward Romance?"

276
00:15:53,038 --> 00:15:56,058
It's so touching and fun.

277
00:15:58,847 --> 00:15:59,897
Yes.

278
00:16:03,548 --> 00:16:04,598
Why...

279
00:16:06,747 --> 00:16:08,808
Is there something on my face?

280
00:16:10,758 --> 00:16:12,037
Why are you staring?

281
00:16:14,957 --> 00:16:16,147
It's nothing.

282
00:16:20,028 --> 00:16:21,078
That's weird.

283
00:16:25,607 --> 00:16:26,688
Hey.

284
00:16:27,207 --> 00:16:28,488
My face is clean.

285
00:16:40,847 --> 00:16:43,407
("Straightforward Romance")

286
00:16:52,697 --> 00:16:54,718
Was it because she...

287
00:16:56,168 --> 00:16:58,017
acted out a scene just like Do Ra?

288
00:17:00,408 --> 00:17:02,728
Even so, how could I
mistake her for Do Ra?

289
00:17:05,447 --> 00:17:06,627
That's impossible.

290
00:17:09,117 --> 00:17:10,228
It's impossible.

291
00:17:14,447 --> 00:17:17,938
("Don't Lie")

292
00:17:20,727 --> 00:17:21,807
My gosh.

293
00:17:22,098 --> 00:17:24,307
The ratings went through the roof.

294
00:17:25,098 --> 00:17:27,618
No wonder. The script was amazing.

295
00:17:31,438 --> 00:17:34,158
Gosh. What's this?

What happened?

299

The lead actress died?

300
00:17:46,418 --> 00:17:47,868
Why?

(Park Do Ra Agrees to Sponsorship
to Cover Her Mother's Debt?)

302
00:17:50,318 --> 00:17:51,968

00:18:01,568 --> 00:18:04,388

00:18:10,537 --> 00:18:12,557
Director Ko.

308
00:18:12,908 --> 00:18:15,618
Director Ko, is it true
that Actress Park Do Ra,

309
00:18:15,618 --> 00:18:17,928
the female lead of
"Straightforward Romance" is dead?

310
00:18:19,588 --> 00:18:20,668
What did you say?

311
00:18:20,747 --> 00:18:23,733
There are some articles about it.

312
00:18:23,757 --> 00:18:26,158
Is it true
that Park Do Ra killed herself...

313
00:18:26,158 --> 00:18:27,487
because she traded sexual favors
for money...

314
00:18:27,487 --> 00:18:29,277

318
00:18:37,898 --> 00:18:39,918
The articles are all fake and false.

319
00:18:40,707 --> 00:18:42,438
Do Ra killed herself
because of people like you...

320
00:18:42,438 --> 00:18:44,537
who liked to gossip about her
without knowing anything.

321
00:18:44,537 --> 00:18:45,628
Understand?

322
00:18:46,648 --> 00:18:48,497
So don't go shooting your mouth off.

323
00:18:54,918 --> 00:18:57,767
What made Director Ko so upset?

324
00:18:58,358 --> 00:19:00,457
It's not like I made things up.

325
00:19:00,457 --> 00:19:04,247
I was just surprised,
so I asked out of curiosity.

326
00:19:05,928 --> 00:19:09,087
Is it that he can't bear
the sight of me?

327
00:19:10,938 --> 00:19:14,914
I'm so grateful that you've decided
to work here at my store.

328
00:19:14,938 --> 00:19:16,507
It took a load off my mind.

329
00:19:16,507 --> 00:19:19,327
What are you talking about?
I'm the one who needs to thank you.

330
00:19:20,148 --> 00:19:23,078
You got me a job
at such a nice place like this...

331
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,297
when I could work only half a month.

332
00:19:25,688 --> 00:19:28,348
It wouldn't be enough
even if I stayed up all night...

333
00:19:28,348 --> 00:19:30,007
telling you how grateful I was.

334
00:19:30,757 --> 00:19:32,987
What I did is no big deal.

335
00:19:32,987 --> 00:19:34,777
Come on. It is a big deal.

336
00:19:35,428 --> 00:19:38,047
You even sold me your car
that was as good as new...

337
00:19:38,598 --> 00:19:41,618
at a giveaway price the other day.

338
00:19:41,997 --> 00:19:45,448
Thanks to you, Pil Seung is
making good use of it.

339
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:49,578
I see.

340
00:19:49,578 --> 00:19:51,338
So Pil Seung is driving it.

341
00:19:51,338 --> 00:19:52,648
Of course.

342
00:19:52,648 --> 00:19:55,257
He's the only one who needs a car
in our family.

343
00:19:55,878 --> 00:19:59,297
By the way,
is Director Ko Pil Seung doing well?

344
00:19:59,517 --> 00:20:02,037
He's just busy as always.

345
00:20:02,888 --> 00:20:05,928
He got to work on a big project
for a new TV series,

346
00:20:05,928 --> 00:20:07,807
so I don't see
much of him these days.

347
00:20:07,858 --> 00:20:08,997
My gosh.

348
00:20:08,997 --> 00:20:11,757
I'm so glad that Pil Seung
got to direct a new TV series.

349
00:20:11,757 --> 00:20:12,948
Yes.

350
00:20:13,898 --> 00:20:17,443
So does he
not have a girlfriend yet?

351
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:18,948
No.

352
00:20:19,537 --> 00:20:21,967
And you promised...

353
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:23,977
you'd find someone nice
for Pil Seung.

354
00:20:23,977 --> 00:20:25,777
So I always tell him...

355
00:20:25,777 --> 00:20:28,257
not to date some random girl.

356
00:20:28,348 --> 00:20:29,918
That's good.

357
00:20:29,918 --> 00:20:31,578
Now that he's the main director,

358
00:20:31,578 --> 00:20:33,638
I should start looking
for someone nice for him.

359
00:20:39,388 --> 00:20:41,337
Why isn't he coming out?

360
00:20:41,688 --> 00:20:43,408
I texted him a long while ago.

361
00:20:44,257 --> 00:20:47,247
If he comes late,
it will get all soggy.

362
00:20:49,497 --> 00:20:50,547
Oh, dear.

363
00:20:51,938 --> 00:20:52,988
Gosh.

364
00:20:56,678 --> 00:20:58,628
You're here, Director Ko.

365
00:21:00,977 --> 00:21:03,767
What is it
you wanted to see me about?

366
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,968
The thing is, Director Ko,

367
00:21:09,787 --> 00:21:12,807
I'm really sorry about earlier.

368
00:21:13,527 --> 00:21:15,828
I shouldn't have shut
my mouth off like that...

369
00:21:15,828 --> 00:21:19,277
about someone
who died such a tragic death.

370
00:21:19,868 --> 00:21:21,178
Is that why you wanted to see me?

371
00:21:21,398 --> 00:21:22,517
Yes.

372
00:21:23,438 --> 00:21:26,207
If someone I cared about
passed away...

373
00:21:26,207 --> 00:21:28,507
and I saw people gossip about it,

374
00:21:28,507 --> 00:21:31,888
I would be furious and heartbroken.

375
00:21:33,447 --> 00:21:34,997
I'm sorry, Director Ko.

376
00:21:35,547 --> 00:21:36,827
It was my bad.

377
00:21:38,078 --> 00:21:39,368
Let's stop talking about it.

378
00:21:41,787 --> 00:21:44,318
I used to live in the countryside,

379
00:21:44,318 --> 00:21:46,807
so I rarely watched TV.

380
00:21:47,388 --> 00:21:49,277
And a few years ago...

381
00:21:50,398 --> 00:21:51,607
Oh, dear.

382
00:21:52,328 --> 00:21:55,247
I met with an accident
and was seriously ill for a while.

383
00:21:56,338 --> 00:21:59,418
I was in hospital for a long time,

384
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,608
so I had no idea what was
going on around the world.

385
00:22:01,608 --> 00:22:04,128
That's why I made
such a stupid mistake.

386
00:22:04,938 --> 00:22:06,827
I'm really sorry, Director Ko.

387
00:22:08,848 --> 00:22:11,348
From now on,
I won't ask any silly questions...

388
00:22:11,348 --> 00:22:14,597
or waste my breath
saying useless things.

389
00:22:17,487 --> 00:22:18,537
Okay.

390
00:22:19,557 --> 00:22:21,138
I'm sorry I blew up at you.

391
00:22:23,098 --> 00:22:24,148
All right then.

392
00:22:24,227 --> 00:22:26,918
Gosh. Wait, Director Ko.

393
00:22:27,068 --> 00:22:28,478
Hang on a second.

394
00:22:35,068 --> 00:22:36,357
I made this...

395
00:22:36,838 --> 00:22:39,158
as a token of my apology.

396
00:22:41,007 --> 00:22:42,257
Please accept it.

397
00:22:44,017 --> 00:22:45,067
Gosh.

398
00:22:45,277 --> 00:22:47,198
I'll get going then.

399
00:23:09,668 --> 00:23:12,488
That young lady
has such an open hand.

400
00:23:13,508 --> 00:23:14,589
That's right.

401
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:17,208
She helped her grandmother
run a diner in the countryside.

402
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:18,609
I guess that's why.

403
00:23:18,609 --> 00:23:21,248
Mom, it's not just she has an open hand.
It tastes so good.

404
00:23:21,248 --> 00:23:23,325
It's a lot better
than restaurant food.

405
00:23:23,349 --> 00:23:24,518
- I know.
- Right.

406
00:23:24,518 --> 00:23:26,948
- She should open a diner.
- Yes.

407
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:28,988
Right. Tell her to open a diner.

408
00:23:28,988 --> 00:23:31,258
With this food, the diner will be
jam-packed with customers.

409
00:23:31,258 --> 00:23:33,664
Her cooking is too good
to be wasted.

410
00:23:33,688 --> 00:23:34,808
Pil Seung.

411
00:23:35,329 --> 00:23:37,409
I bet she's hard-working
at the broadcasting station too.

412
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:39,508
Yes.

413
00:23:41,198 --> 00:23:43,299
One thing about a person
can say a lot about the rest of her.

414
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:45,149
We found a good tenant this time.

415
00:23:51,109 --> 00:23:52,958
This is strange though.

416
00:23:53,609 --> 00:23:55,998
I feel like I've seen her before.

417
00:23:57,748 --> 00:23:58,829
You mean, Ji Young?

418
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:02,899
Yes. I found it strange,
so I asked her...

419
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:05,718
if we'd met before.

420
00:24:05,718 --> 00:24:07,928
And she said
she'd never seen me before.

421
00:24:07,928 --> 00:24:08,978
She denied it.

422
00:24:09,389 --> 00:24:12,808
I guess you saw someone
that looked just like her before.

423
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:15,949
Right. I guess that's true.

424
00:24:16,468 --> 00:24:18,599
Anyway, I'm so glad...

425
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:21,889
that we found a nice tenant
thanks to Pil Seung.

426
00:24:22,339 --> 00:24:24,309
You give Pil Seung
credit for that too?

427
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:26,689
For you, everything has
something to do with him, right?

428
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:29,379
- You're right.
- But that's true.

429
00:24:29,379 --> 00:24:31,819
- It's all thanks to Pil Seung.
- Gosh, seriously.

430
00:24:31,819 --> 00:24:33,169
My gosh.

431
00:24:48,998 --> 00:24:50,988
My goodness.

432
00:25:11,918 --> 00:25:13,008
Are you all right?

433
00:25:15,258 --> 00:25:16,379
Yes.

434
00:25:17,228 --> 00:25:18,409
You should watch out for the bump.

435
00:25:18,928 --> 00:25:21,478
Okay. Thank you.

436
00:25:22,468 --> 00:25:24,938
By the way, what are you doing here
at this hour?

437
00:25:24,938 --> 00:25:25,938
What?

438
00:25:25,938 --> 00:25:28,809
Well... I felt like having a snack,

439
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:30,488
so I bought something to eat.

440
00:25:32,109 --> 00:25:34,998
Were you exercising
at this hour of the night?

441
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:36,408
Yes.

442
00:25:36,408 --> 00:25:38,478
The noodles you got me earlier
were really good,

443
00:25:38,478 --> 00:25:40,149
so I ate too much.

444
00:25:40,149 --> 00:25:42,139
Did you really like it?

445
00:25:42,448 --> 00:25:43,688
Do you mean it?

446
00:25:43,688 --> 00:25:44,688
Yes.

447
00:25:44,688 --> 00:25:46,688
All my family enjoyed it. Thank you.

448
00:25:46,688 --> 00:25:48,688
I'm so glad to hear that.

449
00:25:48,688 --> 00:25:50,829
It was too small,

450
00:25:50,829 --> 00:25:53,208
so I was worried
it wouldn't be enough.

451
00:25:54,069 --> 00:25:56,748
I'll make it big next time.

452
00:25:57,569 --> 00:25:59,899
No need. It's late,
so you should go home.

453
00:25:59,899 --> 00:26:01,438
I'll run one more lap.

454
00:26:01,438 --> 00:26:02,718
Okay.

455
00:26:05,579 --> 00:26:07,629
Good luck, Director Ko!

456
00:26:11,418 --> 00:26:12,468
My gosh.

457
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,188
Even the way he jogs is so pretty.

458
00:26:16,188 --> 00:26:18,238
He's so light-footed.

459
00:26:21,188 --> 00:26:22,379
What's with my heart?

460
00:26:25,158 --> 00:26:26,849
Why is my heart racing?

461
00:26:45,649 --> 00:26:46,678
My gosh.

462
00:26:46,678 --> 00:26:47,968
What was I thinking about?

463
00:26:50,049 --> 00:26:53,038
Am I developing a crush on him?

464
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,649
Goodness.

465
00:27:05,968 --> 00:27:07,818
Hey, Grandma.

466
00:27:08,468 --> 00:27:10,359
Is everything good with you?

467
00:27:11,178 --> 00:27:13,058
Yes, all is well,

468
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:16,199
but I'm restless for some reason.

469
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:19,028
You're restless?

470
00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:22,738
You went to Seoul to have a career,

471
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:25,568
so these feelings you're having...

472
00:27:25,718 --> 00:27:28,258
must not be because of some guy.

473
00:27:28,258 --> 00:27:30,799
Gosh, of course not.

474
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,478
As if.

475
00:27:32,629 --> 00:27:34,218
I can read you like a book.

476
00:27:34,369 --> 00:27:35,899
Grandma, I need to go to bed.

477
00:27:35,899 --> 00:27:38,748
I'll call you tomorrow, then.

478
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:43,389
Can she read minds or what?

479
00:27:43,678 --> 00:27:46,058
I only said I was feeling funny,

480
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:48,329
but she knew
it was because of a guy.

481
00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:53,528
What the...
Do I really have a crush on him?

482
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:56,099
Gosh.

(From Actress Se Ra)

486
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:06,829
- Check it out.
- Is it from Se Ra?

- No way.
- I can't believe it.

(Supporting Director Ko Pil Seung,

489
00:28:11,738 --> 00:28:13,758
- We'll enjoy it.
- Thanks.

490
00:28:16,268 --> 00:28:17,788
- Thank you, Director Ko.
- Gosh.

491
00:28:22,649 --> 00:28:24,369
- Look.
- Gosh, it's her.

492
00:28:24,718 --> 00:28:26,418
- She's prettier in real life.
- She's so pretty.

493
00:28:26,418 --> 00:28:28,738
- Hi, everyone. Thanks.
- Thanks for the coffee.

494
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:32,468
Director Ko, hi.

495
00:28:32,619 --> 00:28:33,829
Se Ra, it's been a while.

496
00:28:33,829 --> 00:28:35,008
I appreciate the coffee cart.

497
00:28:35,988 --> 00:28:38,478
But this really wasn't necessary.

498
00:28:38,629 --> 00:28:40,599
It's your first mini-series,

499
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:42,048
so how is this too much?

500
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,889
We worked together,
so this is the least I could do.

501
00:28:45,238 --> 00:28:47,159
Thanks for your support.
I'll enjoy the coffee.

502
00:28:48,369 --> 00:28:49,419
Director Ko,

503
00:28:50,309 --> 00:28:52,889
don't we have something
to talk about?

504
00:28:55,948 --> 00:28:57,099
I'm sorry, Se Ra,

505
00:28:58,079 --> 00:28:59,149
but I don't have
the emotional capacity...

506
00:28:59,149 --> 00:29:00,268
to date anyone right now.

507
00:29:01,018 --> 00:29:02,099
Se Ra,

508
00:29:02,289 --> 00:29:05,139
let's meet again sometime
as director and actor.

509
00:29:07,258 --> 00:29:08,609
Was that a rejection?

510
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:09,839
I'm sorry,

511
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:11,329
but I appreciate
the coffee cart today.

512
00:29:11,329 --> 00:29:13,849
I'll return the favor
when you begin a new project.

513
00:29:14,629 --> 00:29:15,879
But...

514
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:19,449
What the... Are you kidding me?

515
00:29:20,198 --> 00:29:22,419
Is he kidding me
with that wall he put up?

516
00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:26,329
Being tall and handsome
isn't an excuse.

517
00:29:28,109 --> 00:29:29,199
Maybe it is.

518
00:29:39,389 --> 00:29:42,179
Gosh, what did I
stumble upon just now?

519
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:44,734
Did Director Ko...

520
00:29:44,758 --> 00:29:47,349
reject the advances of Se Ra,

521
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:48,818
Korea's Queen of Rom-com?

522
00:29:51,399 --> 00:29:53,639
He's a man who isn't interested...

523
00:29:53,639 --> 00:29:56,119
in the beautiful and cool Se Ra,

524
00:29:56,168 --> 00:29:58,528
but I had the audacity
to develop a crush.

525
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:01,599
This is wrong.

526
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:06,699
I'm nothing compared to Se Ra,

527
00:30:06,879 --> 00:30:08,968
so I had some nerve to like the guy.

528
00:30:09,988 --> 00:30:12,139
That's right.

529
00:30:12,289 --> 00:30:15,538
From now on,
I won't see Director Ko that way.

530
00:30:16,458 --> 00:30:18,308
He'll be a rock to me.

531
00:30:25,238 --> 00:30:26,738
Mom, it's me.

532
00:30:26,738 --> 00:30:28,488
- Hey.
- Hey, Ma Ri.

533
00:30:29,938 --> 00:30:33,659
Gosh, Ma Ri. It's been so long.

534
00:30:33,809 --> 00:30:35,579
Have you been well, Ms. Kim?

535
00:30:35,579 --> 00:30:38,268
I hope you've been well too, Ma Ri.

536
00:30:38,349 --> 00:30:40,028
- I have.
- Goodness.

537
00:30:40,379 --> 00:30:42,424
I almost forgot.
Ru Ru, say hi to Ms. Kim.

538
00:30:42,448 --> 00:30:44,508
"Hi, Ms. Kim."

539
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:47,909
Right. Hi, Ru Ru.

540
00:30:50,658 --> 00:30:52,409
- Goodness.
- You look nice today.

541
00:30:56,029 --> 00:30:57,179
Hey, Pil Seung.

542
00:30:58,299 --> 00:30:59,619
You're already here?

543
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:02,689
I'm almost done here,
so I'll meet you outside.

544
00:31:03,879 --> 00:31:05,539
Is Pil Seung here?

545
00:31:05,539 --> 00:31:08,149
Yes, he got off work early.

546
00:31:08,149 --> 00:31:11,068
I asked if he could pick me up,
and he's already here.

547
00:31:11,218 --> 00:31:12,728
Who's Pil Seung?

548
00:31:12,849 --> 00:31:14,268
He's my son.

549
00:31:15,049 --> 00:31:19,508
Now that I think about it,
you two have never met.

550
00:31:19,789 --> 00:31:21,904
Pil Seung's like
a big brother to you,

551
00:31:21,928 --> 00:31:23,708
so would you like to say hi?

552
00:31:24,129 --> 00:31:26,508
- But...
- A big brother? I'd love that.

553
00:31:26,859 --> 00:31:28,619
Ma Ri, Sun Young.

554
00:31:29,228 --> 00:31:31,288
Maybe next time.
We'll officially introduce them.

555
00:31:32,238 --> 00:31:34,818
Mom, we can meet today,
so why put it off till later?

556
00:31:35,109 --> 00:31:37,379
I'll go say hi to her son.

557
00:31:37,379 --> 00:31:38,615
Ms. Kim, let's go.

558
00:31:38,639 --> 00:31:39,908
You should since he's here.

559
00:31:39,908 --> 00:31:41,028
But...

560
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:42,929
Gosh, what now?

561
00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:45,228
Pil Seung, gosh.
You're already here.

562
00:31:45,518 --> 00:31:46,629
Pil Seung.

563
00:31:47,518 --> 00:31:49,639
- Hey, Mom.
- You're here early.

564
00:31:49,748 --> 00:31:52,164
- You worked hard today.
- I could tell you the same thing.

565
00:31:52,188 --> 00:31:53,808
- Let's go, Mom.
- Right. Oh, hold on.

566
00:31:56,059 --> 00:31:57,139
Are you all right?

567
00:31:59,228 --> 00:32:00,548
It's him from that day.

568
00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:02,299
It's him.

569
00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:04,248
- We should go, Mom.
- Sure. Wait.

570
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,558
Say hi, Pil Seung.
She's Soo Yeon's daughter.

571
00:32:08,609 --> 00:32:09,958
Gosh. Is that so?

572
00:32:10,069 --> 00:32:11,228
Hi.

573
00:32:12,678 --> 00:32:13,998
Hi.

574
00:32:17,779 --> 00:32:21,038
Hold on. Haven't we met before?

575
00:32:22,248 --> 00:32:23,369
Where?

576
00:32:23,849 --> 00:32:26,018
I doubt it.
You two probably haven't met.

577
00:32:26,018 --> 00:32:27,169
Actually, we have.

578
00:32:27,389 --> 00:32:31,248
We met a few years back.

579
00:32:33,498 --> 00:32:34,599
Aren't you the one...

580
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:37,069
who dropped your doll
outside the subway station?

581
00:32:37,069 --> 00:32:38,248
You gave me lemon candy.

582
00:32:38,639 --> 00:32:43,318
That's right.
I gave you lemon candy.

583
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:47,258
Goodness me.
Have you met each other before?

584
00:32:48,809 --> 00:32:50,279
How fascinating.

585
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:52,399
The man of her dreams
she has been searching for...

586
00:32:52,918 --> 00:32:54,538
- is Pil Seung?
- What's your name?

587
00:32:54,649 --> 00:32:55,718
It's Ma Ri.

588
00:32:55,718 --> 00:32:57,149
- Gong Ma Ri.
- What's going on?

589
00:32:57,149 --> 00:32:58,889
Ms. Gong, I'll see you around.

590
00:32:58,889 --> 00:33:00,589
- Sure.
- Ma Ri, take care.

591
00:33:00,589 --> 00:33:02,228
Soo Yeon, I'll get going.

592
00:33:02,228 --> 00:33:03,829
- Right. Take care.
- Sure.

593
00:33:03,829 --> 00:33:06,109
Ms. Jang, we'll get going.
I'll see you around.

594
00:33:15,238 --> 00:33:18,829
Mom, the guy I've been searching for
who is my destiny...

595
00:33:18,938 --> 00:33:20,758
is him!

596
00:33:22,478 --> 00:33:23,728
Could you be mistaken?

597
00:33:24,718 --> 00:33:25,819
I'm not.

598
00:33:25,819 --> 00:33:28,619
He remembers me too
and the fact I gave him lemon candy.

599
00:33:28,619 --> 00:33:31,409
Gosh, he remembers me too!

600
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:33,319
Mom, you said so yourself.

601
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:36,008
If we were destined to be,
we were bound to meet again.

602
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:39,658
He truly must be my destiny.

603
00:33:39,658 --> 00:33:41,369
How else can you explain
about us meeting like this?

604
00:33:41,369 --> 00:33:42,998
You were right all along.

605
00:33:42,998 --> 00:33:44,988
My gosh!

606
00:33:50,238 --> 00:33:52,089
Dad!

607
00:33:54,748 --> 00:33:56,649
Ma Ri, what's going on?

608
00:33:56,649 --> 00:33:59,268
Dad, don't be shocked
by what I have to say.

609
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,649
Goodness, Princess Ma Ri.

610
00:34:01,649 --> 00:34:03,439
What are you excited about this time?

611
00:34:04,059 --> 00:34:06,789
Dad, I met the man
I'm destined to be with...

612
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:08,278
who I've been searching for.

613
00:34:08,988 --> 00:34:11,508
What?
The man you're destined to be with?

614
00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:13,059
Are you sure?

615
00:34:13,059 --> 00:34:14,728
Dad, take a guess.

616
00:34:14,728 --> 00:34:18,069
He turned out to be someone
close to us.

617
00:34:18,069 --> 00:34:20,988
Someone close to us?
Who could it be?

618
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:24,559
Ms. Kim's son.

619
00:34:25,038 --> 00:34:27,059
It was Pil Seung all along!

620
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,099
What did you say? Pil Seung?

621
00:34:32,748 --> 00:34:34,719
The man you've been searching for...

622
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,449
- was Pil Seung?
- Yes.

623
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:39,139
Honey, is this true?

624
00:34:39,888 --> 00:34:42,465
Yes, so it seems.

625
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:46,399
Dad, do you also know him?
Have you two met?

626
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,429
Of course, I know him.
We've also met.

627
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:50,949
Really? For real?

628
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,749
Then can you help me?

629
00:34:54,208 --> 00:34:57,609
I want to marry him.

630
00:34:57,609 --> 00:34:59,559
- What?
- Let me marry him.

631
00:35:00,308 --> 00:35:01,358
Ma Ri?

632
00:35:01,949 --> 00:35:04,578
You're a powerful man
and can make anything happen.

633
00:35:04,578 --> 00:35:08,199
Have me marry him, Dad.

634
00:35:08,449 --> 00:35:09,568
What?

635
00:35:12,418 --> 00:35:13,468
Please?

636
00:35:14,688 --> 00:35:16,309
- Do you mean that?
- Yes!

637
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,438
Why did it have to be Pil Seung...

638
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:46,209
of all people?

639
00:35:47,288 --> 00:35:49,809
This can't happen. It's absurd.

640
00:35:50,958 --> 00:35:52,449
Ma Ri and Pil Seung?

641
00:35:53,429 --> 00:35:56,179
They can't be together. Never.

642
00:36:35,038 --> 00:36:38,358
Pil Seung, I'm so glad
I got to see you again.

643
00:36:39,109 --> 00:36:40,829
I missed you so much.

644
00:36:42,549 --> 00:36:43,599
Do Ra...

645
00:36:45,978 --> 00:36:47,068
Same here.

646
00:36:49,449 --> 00:36:51,139
I missed you so much as well.

647
00:37:17,379 --> 00:37:19,369
Good morning, Director Ko!

648
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:35,249
We have such good weather today.

649
00:37:36,498 --> 00:37:38,789
The wind is gently blowing and...

650
00:37:44,708 --> 00:37:45,959
What is it?

651
00:37:51,518 --> 00:37:52,668
It's nothing.

652
00:38:01,388 --> 00:38:04,859
Kim Ji Young, you lame girl.

653
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:06,899
What's the matter with you?

654
00:38:06,899 --> 00:38:10,768
Looking at him
with love in your eyes...

655
00:38:10,768 --> 00:38:13,119
is what chased him away.

656
00:38:13,998 --> 00:38:16,469
Don't you look at him
like that again.

657
00:38:16,469 --> 00:38:18,059
Look at his shoes!

658
00:38:19,138 --> 00:38:20,879
Goodness, guys.

659
00:38:20,879 --> 00:38:24,248
I'm delivering this
straight from the Alps.

660
00:38:24,248 --> 00:38:25,549
That must've been a long trip.

661
00:38:25,549 --> 00:38:29,398
I was bored,
so I thought I'd make the trip.

662
00:38:37,129 --> 00:38:38,179
Ms. Kim.

663
00:38:39,458 --> 00:38:41,418
Yes, Director Ko.

664
00:38:47,469 --> 00:38:50,488
Ms. Kim, do you have relatives
living in Seoul?

665
00:38:51,409 --> 00:38:54,289
Relatives? No, I don't.

666
00:38:56,248 --> 00:39:00,199
It's just my grandma and me
against the whole world.

667
00:39:01,348 --> 00:39:03,869
Actually, truth be told,

668
00:39:04,418 --> 00:39:07,778
this is my first time in Seoul.

669
00:39:10,629 --> 00:39:12,008
Why are you asking me that?

670
00:39:12,728 --> 00:39:15,548
It's nothing.
Please get back to work.

671
00:39:16,029 --> 00:39:17,079
Sure.

672
00:39:25,909 --> 00:39:27,355
Sorry about that.

673
00:39:27,379 --> 00:39:28,459
That's right.

674
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,898
She didn't even know of Park Do Ra.

675
00:39:31,918 --> 00:39:33,869
So how could they be related?

676
00:39:35,049 --> 00:39:36,099
But why...

677
00:39:36,888 --> 00:39:39,008
Why do I see her as Do Ra?

678
00:39:40,319 --> 00:39:42,209
Could it be the result...

679
00:39:43,259 --> 00:39:44,608
of me thinking about her recently?

680
00:40:18,225 --> 00:40:20,786
- Mom!
- What the... You startled me.

681
00:40:21,382 --> 00:40:22,481
Did you go shopping
with my credit card?

682
00:40:22,481 --> 00:40:24,571
What did you buy
that cost over 2,000 dollars?

683
00:40:25,081 --> 00:40:26,142
What...

684
00:40:27,301 --> 00:40:28,981
Did you buy this all
on my credit card?

685
00:40:29,502 --> 00:40:30,502
What else could I do?

686
00:40:30,502 --> 00:40:32,971
I needed a proper outfit
to conduct business with.

687
00:40:32,971 --> 00:40:35,322
It's not like I can go around
looking like a bum.

688
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:38,312
I get that, but how could
you spend 2,000 dollars at once?

689
00:40:38,312 --> 00:40:39,691
Are you out of your mind?

690
00:40:39,882 --> 00:40:41,612
It's not like I bought
from designer labels.

691
00:40:41,612 --> 00:40:44,862
I got myself a couple of outfits
for the price of one.

692
00:40:44,951 --> 00:40:46,382
You should've packed
my clothes and purses...

693
00:40:46,382 --> 00:40:47,822
when selling our house
in Cheongdam-dong.

694
00:40:47,822 --> 00:40:49,872
Then I wouldn't have had
to go shopping.

695
00:40:50,692 --> 00:40:52,612
Unbelievable. Mom, have a seat.

696
00:40:53,121 --> 00:40:54,541
Sit down, will you?

697
00:41:00,002 --> 00:41:02,751
Secure your things? When everything
had seizure stickers on them?

698
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,282
Mom,

699
00:41:04,402 --> 00:41:07,042
with my monthly wage,
I pay rent and my utility bills,

700
00:41:07,042 --> 00:41:08,101
and pay off some of your debt.

701
00:41:08,101 --> 00:41:09,172
That leaves me
with practically nothing...

702
00:41:09,172 --> 00:41:10,822
which I have to live on.

703
00:41:10,911 --> 00:41:13,892
So how could you go out
spending 2,000 dollars?

704
00:41:14,042 --> 00:41:15,482
When will I be able to save up
for my own place?

705
00:41:15,482 --> 00:41:17,601
How clueless are you?

706
00:41:18,511 --> 00:41:22,991
How dare you talk to me like that
when I raised you?

707
00:41:22,991 --> 00:41:25,422
I had you wear the nicest clothes...

708
00:41:25,422 --> 00:41:26,862
and eat the nicest things.

709
00:41:26,862 --> 00:41:29,092
You lived in luxury thanks to me,

710
00:41:29,092 --> 00:41:31,412
but you're biting my head off
over a few thousand dollars.

711
00:41:32,331 --> 00:41:33,811
What did you ever do for me?

712
00:41:34,761 --> 00:41:36,632
We lived in luxury thanks to Do Ra,

713
00:41:36,632 --> 00:41:38,081
so who are you
to take credit for that?

714
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:39,801
You brat!

715
00:41:39,801 --> 00:41:43,262
Who does she have to thank
for helping her build a career?

716
00:41:43,411 --> 00:41:44,812
People are right to say...

717
00:41:44,812 --> 00:41:46,681
that raising children
is a waste of time.

718
00:41:46,681 --> 00:41:48,882
I had to suffer
for over two years...

719
00:41:48,882 --> 00:41:51,652
living on the cold floors
of a prison cell,

720
00:41:51,652 --> 00:41:52,822
so how can you
raise your voice at me...

721
00:41:52,822 --> 00:41:54,851
over the few clothes I bought?

722
00:41:54,851 --> 00:41:55,991
Unbelievable.

723
00:41:55,991 --> 00:41:57,621
Do Ra!

724
00:41:57,621 --> 00:42:01,121
I should've taken my life too
when Do Ra ended hers.

725
00:42:01,121 --> 00:42:02,462
Do Ra, you should've
taken me with you.

726
00:42:02,462 --> 00:42:06,732
Why did you leave without me?

727
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:08,732
Seriously. Why?

728
00:42:08,732 --> 00:42:11,282
- This is so unfair.
- Unbelievable.

729
00:42:11,572 --> 00:42:14,751
I've been wronged, darn it.

730
00:42:15,342 --> 00:42:17,772
What has become of my life?

731
00:42:17,772 --> 00:42:20,432
Darn it!

732
00:42:27,482 --> 00:42:30,242
What's the matter with our mom?

733
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:35,041
How am I supposed
to keep living like this?

734
00:42:41,261 --> 00:42:42,682
Darn it.

735
00:43:22,911 --> 00:43:23,961
Mom.

736
00:43:24,572 --> 00:43:26,331
Mom, get up.

737
00:43:26,911 --> 00:43:30,231
Mom, get up. We need to talk.

738
00:43:32,752 --> 00:43:33,932
What now?

739
00:43:35,891 --> 00:43:37,101
Have you been drinking?

740
00:43:37,752 --> 00:43:39,362
Are you causing a scene...

741
00:43:39,362 --> 00:43:42,372
after getting wasted
over the money I spent?

742
00:43:43,531 --> 00:43:44,642
Mom,

743
00:43:45,491 --> 00:43:48,381
I feel bad for Do Ra.

744
00:43:49,331 --> 00:43:52,351
Our poor Do Ra
couldn't have had it worse.

745
00:43:53,371 --> 00:43:55,921
I didn't realize it
when Do Ra was around.

746
00:43:56,911 --> 00:43:58,262
But at this job,

747
00:43:58,971 --> 00:44:01,932
I barely make enough a month
to put food on the table.

748
00:44:02,911 --> 00:44:03,911
It's been so challenging for me,

749
00:44:03,911 --> 00:44:05,762
so imagine
what Do Ra had to go through.

750
00:44:06,752 --> 00:44:08,752
She paid
for Do Jun's education abroad...

751
00:44:08,752 --> 00:44:11,302
and let the two of us
live in luxury.

752
00:44:11,792 --> 00:44:14,072
I took that for granted.

753
00:44:15,831 --> 00:44:16,891
And now I feel terrible...

754
00:44:16,891 --> 00:44:19,041
because I did nothing
to support her back then.

755
00:44:20,462 --> 00:44:22,801
You used to spend
tens of thousands of dollars,

756
00:44:22,801 --> 00:44:24,701
and I hate
that I got angry with you...

757
00:44:24,701 --> 00:44:27,021
for spending 2,000 dollars.

758
00:44:30,442 --> 00:44:32,162
Do Sik, my gosh.

759
00:44:35,411 --> 00:44:36,532
Mom.

760
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:39,112
If you spend 2,000 dollars
that easily,

761
00:44:39,112 --> 00:44:42,432
I won't be able to save up my money.

762
00:44:42,822 --> 00:44:45,972
So please... Please Mom...

763
00:44:46,822 --> 00:44:48,112
Our Do Ra...

764
00:44:48,891 --> 00:44:51,182
lived her whole life
earning money for us all.

765
00:44:52,362 --> 00:44:54,981
Our poor Do Ra...

766
00:44:55,462 --> 00:44:57,381
I feel terrible, Mom.

767
00:45:06,542 --> 00:45:09,862
Do Ra...

768
00:45:10,212 --> 00:45:12,362
Do Sik...

769
00:45:25,331 --> 00:45:26,711
Hagfish and pork belly cartilage?

770
00:45:27,531 --> 00:45:28,912
That sounds great.

771
00:45:29,732 --> 00:45:30,881
I have butterflies.

772
00:45:31,172 --> 00:45:33,402
- What? Butterflies?
- Yes.

773
00:45:33,402 --> 00:45:36,222
What kind of woman gets butterflies
because of hagfish and cartilage?

774
00:45:51,341 --> 00:45:53,190
(Young Mi Snacks)

775
00:45:57,331 --> 00:45:59,711
(Young Mi Snacks)

776
00:46:01,962 --> 00:46:03,021
Do Ra.

777
00:46:06,301 --> 00:46:07,351
Do Ra.

778
00:46:13,942 --> 00:46:15,061
Do Ra.

779
00:46:17,181 --> 00:46:18,262
Hey.

780
00:46:21,221 --> 00:46:22,302
Goodness.

781
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:24,849
What's the matter, Director Ko?

782
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:26,349
Are you okay?

783
00:46:33,609 --> 00:46:35,329
That's weird. Hey.

784
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,130
Gosh.

785
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,800
Is he like that because he's drunk?

786
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:46,740
How much did he drink
that he could barely walk?

787
00:46:48,219 --> 00:46:52,240
I think he said "Do Ra."

788
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:54,280
Was I mistaken?

789
00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:57,880
Oh, no.

790
00:46:59,799 --> 00:47:03,720
He won't end up falling down,
will he?

791
00:47:04,009 --> 00:47:05,190
Oh, dear.

792
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:07,289
My tteokbokki...

793
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,599
Oh, gosh.

794
00:47:23,129 --> 00:47:24,579
What's wrong with me?

795
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,579
Why do I keep thinking
Ji Young is Do Ra?

796
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:31,220
Why?

797
00:47:32,629 --> 00:47:33,749
Why?

798
00:47:35,069 --> 00:47:36,289
Why?

799
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:09,590
It's been a while.

800
00:48:14,109 --> 00:48:15,229
Do Ra.

801
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:19,099
Are you well?

802
00:48:22,449 --> 00:48:23,769
I'm doing okay.

803
00:48:26,859 --> 00:48:27,909
But...

804
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:32,010
I must want to see you a lot.

805
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,380
I keep mistaking someone for you.

806
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:42,690
But don't worry.

807
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:45,590
I'll try to manage.

808
00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:53,429
Do Ra.

809
00:48:57,150 --> 00:48:58,670
I miss you so much.

810
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:14,920
Do Sik.

811
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:18,260
I made bean sprout hangover soup.

812
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:20,389
Have some before work.

813
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:34,010
Okay.

814
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:37,190
I'll do as you say
and pull myself together...

815
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:39,579
and try to earn money and...

816
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,479
I won't use the credit card.

817
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,016
Wait until I work hard
and make enough...

818
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,370
to move to a two-room apartment.

819
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:51,889
We need to get Do Jun back.

820
00:49:52,469 --> 00:49:53,590
I'm sorry too, Mom.

821
00:49:54,009 --> 00:49:56,530
Do Sik, eat some more. Why...

822
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:06,670
Why did you leave us?

823
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:09,240
How are we to manage without you?

824
00:50:10,359 --> 00:50:12,110
How are we to manage?

825
00:50:23,909 --> 00:50:25,710
Will you work harder?

826
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:27,279
Why are you so slow?

827
00:50:27,279 --> 00:50:29,429
We have a new wave of customers.

828
00:50:29,509 --> 00:50:30,879
Will you speed up?

829
00:50:30,879 --> 00:50:32,879
Okay, sorry. I'll work faster.

830
00:50:32,879 --> 00:50:34,170
Darn you.

831
00:50:37,219 --> 00:50:38,369
My back hurts.

832
00:50:38,850 --> 00:50:40,859
I think my spine might snap.

833
00:50:40,859 --> 00:50:42,159
My goodness.

834
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:44,065
I was sitting for so long
my legs wouldn't even straighten out.

835
00:50:44,089 --> 00:50:47,510
I might work myself sick.
Oh, gosh. My poor legs.

836
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,849
Oh, my goodness. Oh, dear.

837
00:50:51,699 --> 00:50:52,820
Here we go.

838
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:55,289
What is all this?

839
00:50:55,569 --> 00:50:58,659
Oh, my gosh. It's so heavy.

840
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:02,030
Come and take your pick.
Take a look.

841
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:04,829
Take a look, mister. You too, miss.

842
00:51:05,179 --> 00:51:07,996
Come and take a look.

843
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:09,269
Cut. That's no good.

844
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:16,679
She's hoarse because she has a cold.

845
00:51:17,089 --> 00:51:18,240
What should we do?

846
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:19,909
Can we find a replacement
right away?

847
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,759
We'd have to wait three hours...

848
00:51:21,759 --> 00:51:23,420
for someone
to get ready and come over.

849
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:26,789
Can any of our crew step in?

850
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:28,950
Who?

851
00:51:29,969 --> 00:51:31,090
Can you do it?

852
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:33,860
Me?

853
00:51:34,379 --> 00:51:35,860
I can't do it.

854
00:51:38,949 --> 00:51:40,729
Excuse me, Director Ko.

855
00:51:41,779 --> 00:51:44,369
Shall I give it a go?

856
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,369
I went to markets lots of times
when I worked at the restaurant.

857
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:52,010
I think I can do it.

858
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:01,950
Are you ready, Ji Young?

859
00:52:02,739 --> 00:52:03,820
Yes.

860
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:05,860
Standby!

861
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,459
One, two.

862
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:10,499
Ready, cue!

863
00:52:24,589 --> 00:52:25,690
(Filming in progress: "Don't Lie")

864
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:28,799
Take your pick. Snap up a good deal.

865
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:30,870
Come over and snap up a good deal.

866
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:32,870
One for a fiver, two for seven.

867
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:34,690
Take home a great deal.

868
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:39,239
Take your pick. Snap up a good deal.
Come over and snap up a good deal.

869
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:40,940
Take home a great deal.

870
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:42,686
Take home a great deal.

871
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:45,999
Take your pick. Snap up a good deal.
Come on over and look.

872
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:48,179
Even if you find Sprite in the sea,

873
00:52:48,179 --> 00:52:50,266
you can't drink it
if you don't have a bottle opener.

874
00:52:50,290 --> 00:52:53,139
Come and snap up a good deal.

875
00:52:53,489 --> 00:52:55,369
Take your pick.

876
00:52:55,759 --> 00:52:58,010
- Take home a great deal.
- Cut, okay! Great!

877
00:52:59,589 --> 00:53:00,650
Well done.

878
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:04,849
(Filming in progress: "Don't Lie")

879
00:53:05,170 --> 00:53:06,799
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

880
00:53:06,799 --> 00:53:08,920
- Well done.
- That was pretty good.

881
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:13,239
Your rookie's a pretty great actor.

882
00:53:13,239 --> 00:53:14,509
She could debut.

883
00:53:14,509 --> 00:53:16,530
Get a contract. We should sign her.

884
00:53:17,379 --> 00:53:19,429
Thank you.

885
00:53:19,949 --> 00:53:22,229
Ji Young. You were amazing.

886
00:53:22,379 --> 00:53:23,520
Thanks a lot.

887
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,240
You kept us on track today.

888
00:53:25,719 --> 00:53:27,020
You're welcome.

889
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:28,139
Let's get changed.

890
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:31,039
Assistant Director,
make sure she's paid extra.

891
00:53:31,089 --> 00:53:32,089
You bet.

892
00:53:32,089 --> 00:53:33,900
No, it's fine.

893
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:35,880
I don't need the extra pay.

894
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:38,820
Don't say that.
You must be paid for your work.

895
00:53:39,469 --> 00:53:43,289
Well... If you insist...

896
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:45,820
Thank you.

897
00:53:49,009 --> 00:53:51,429
Director Ko. Guess what?

898
00:53:51,909 --> 00:53:54,679
I was so nervous before I started,

899
00:53:54,679 --> 00:53:57,769
but once I got into it,
it was so much fun.

900
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:59,670
Why is this so fun?

901
00:53:59,989 --> 00:54:03,190
If you ever need me for something,

902
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:04,639
hire me again.

903
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:06,110
I want to do it again.

904
00:54:06,629 --> 00:54:08,600
Let's head to the next spot.

905
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,749
Okay.

906
00:54:18,569 --> 00:54:19,690
Director Ko!

907
00:54:23,379 --> 00:54:24,949
Try this.

908
00:54:24,949 --> 00:54:26,819
- What is it?
- Steamed silkworm chrysalis.

909
00:54:26,819 --> 00:54:28,829
Do you know how flavorful this is?

910
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,999
It's nice and salty too.

911
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:33,740
Here.

912
00:54:34,359 --> 00:54:35,996
Do you know how flavorful this is?

913
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:38,079
It's nice and salty too.

914
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:42,299
Here.

915
00:54:42,299 --> 00:54:44,650
Forget it. I don't eat that.

916
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:45,920
Oh, no.

917
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:49,150
The precious chrysalis
are all on the ground.

918
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,590
He could've just said
he didn't want any.

919
00:54:54,879 --> 00:54:57,159
Is he showing off
that he has expensive taste?

920
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:05,300
What's with that woman?

921
00:55:06,859 --> 00:55:08,340
This is driving me insane.

922
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,039
No.

923
00:55:12,089 --> 00:55:13,550
Anyone could say that.

924
00:55:14,629 --> 00:55:17,050
What's the big deal about saying
steamed chrysalis are salty?

925
00:55:18,299 --> 00:55:20,950
She's not weird at all. You are.

926
00:55:27,739 --> 00:55:30,900
<i>I want nobody, nobody but you</i>

927
00:55:34,850 --> 00:55:35,900
Yes.

928
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:56,090
What...

929
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:59,889
What's all this?

930
00:56:02,009 --> 00:56:04,429
All those scenes
that just flashed through my mind.

931
00:56:06,179 --> 00:56:07,499
What was this all about?

932
00:56:32,109 --> 00:56:33,159
What...

933
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:35,130
What's all this?

934
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:37,300
This garden here.

935
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,400
The memories that ran
through my mind had the same garden.

936
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:46,039
Was I here before?

937
00:56:52,359 --> 00:56:53,880
What's going on?

938
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:06,990
Ji Young.

939
00:57:07,409 --> 00:57:08,530
What's wrong?

940
00:57:09,179 --> 00:57:10,360
What are you doing out here?

941
00:57:10,609 --> 00:57:11,659
Well...

942
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:14,170
The thing is...

943
00:57:16,449 --> 00:57:18,869
Director Ko,
something strange happened to me.

944
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,610
Something strange?

945
00:57:22,659 --> 00:57:23,740
I think...

946
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:26,679
I lived in this house
in my previous life.

947
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,780
What are you talking about?

948
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:34,050
I was cooking some ramyeon
with the TV on.

949
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,959
And the songs that once topped
the music charts were playing.

950
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:39,540
Then there was
"Nobody" by Wonder Girls.

951
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:42,379
Right at that moment,
I remembered...

952
00:57:42,379 --> 00:57:45,210
some high school boy
with curly hair...

953
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:48,429
dancing to "Nobody" in this garden.

954
00:57:55,989 --> 00:57:57,110
What?

955
00:57:59,659 --> 00:58:00,900
Are you serious?

956
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,010
Yes.

957
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,820
I'm not making things up.
I'm serious.

958
00:58:05,969 --> 00:58:08,619
I don't even know
why I remember such a thing.

959
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,810
Seriously, I saw...

960
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:15,130
a high school boy with curly hair
dancing in this garden.

961
00:58:19,509 --> 00:58:20,599
What?

962
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:22,630
Hang on.

963
00:58:23,350 --> 00:58:24,639
Come to think of it,

964
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,369
he looked kind of like you.

965
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:31,479
- My goodness.
- What's your deal?

966
00:58:32,529 --> 00:58:33,610
Who are you?

967
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,579
What on earth are you?

968
00:58:38,969 --> 00:58:41,320
Gosh, Director Ko.
Why are you being like this?

969
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:44,590
I'm Kim Ji Young.

970
00:58:45,239 --> 00:58:46,619
Why are you doing this?

971
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:54,329
Well...

972
00:58:56,790 --> 00:58:57,970
I'm sorry.

973
00:59:00,159 --> 00:59:01,240
Sorry.

974
00:59:09,330 --> 00:59:11,820
Why is he being so scary?

975
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:31,570
You.

976
00:59:31,819 --> 00:59:34,639
- My gosh. What the...
- I remembered...

977
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:37,979
some high school boy with curly hair
dancing to "Nobody" in this garden.

978
00:59:39,989 --> 00:59:43,249
Right. That's something
only Do Ra and I know.

979
00:59:44,069 --> 00:59:45,820
There's no way
someone else knows about that.

980
00:59:46,429 --> 00:59:48,090
But how did Ji Young know?

981
00:59:49,870 --> 00:59:50,920
Right.

982
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:53,760
It's not me that's been strange.

983
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:57,030
Does that mean...

984
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:00,030
Ji Young is Do Ra?

985
01:00:03,279 --> 01:00:05,900
No. That can't be right.

986
01:00:07,219 --> 01:00:08,639
Do Ra is dead.

987
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:11,709
And she's
a totally different person.

988
01:00:12,929 --> 01:00:15,380
What am I thinking now?

989
01:00:17,129 --> 01:00:19,150
Everything Ji Young said
is just nonsense.

990
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:24,220
It's just nonsense!
It doesn't make any sense!

991
01:00:47,029 --> 01:00:48,349
My goodness!

992
01:00:57,109 --> 01:00:58,909
- Ji Young!
- Ji Young, are you all right?

993
01:00:58,909 --> 01:01:00,279
- Ji Young.
- Are you okay?

994
01:01:00,279 --> 01:01:01,459
Ji Young.

995
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:04,659
Ji Young.

996
01:01:05,009 --> 01:01:07,300
Ji Young, are you all right?

997
01:01:08,650 --> 01:01:11,840
Ji Young, wake up.

998
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:14,510
- Ji Young.
- Hurry.

(Emergency Medical Center)

1000
01:01:30,710 --> 01:01:32,170
What's her condition?

1001
01:01:32,170 --> 01:01:33,559
Is the test result in?

1002
01:01:33,679 --> 01:01:35,810
Yes. The result says
there's nothing wrong with her.

1003
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:36,959
You don't need to worry.

1004
01:01:39,379 --> 01:01:41,879
But why isn't she waking up...

1005
01:01:41,879 --> 01:01:43,219
when nothing's wrong?

1006
01:01:43,219 --> 01:01:44,290
She will wake up soon.

1007
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:46,400
That's because she's under sedation.

1008
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,340
Okay. Thank you.

1009
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:54,809
What a relief, Director Ko.

1010
01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:58,320
I thought something bad happened
to Ji Young, so I was worried sick.

1011
01:01:59,429 --> 01:02:01,270
I'll take her when she wakes up.

1012
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:03,249
You guys should go back
and wrap things up.

1013
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:05,619
Okay. We will get going then.

1014
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:07,329
Let's go.

1015
01:03:00,330 --> 01:03:02,550
Why am I being like this
around Ji Young?

1016
01:03:03,299 --> 01:03:04,349
Why...

1017
01:03:05,529 --> 01:03:07,289
I can't do this
just because I miss Do Ra.

1018
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,490
What am I doing now?

1019
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,130
I think...

1020
01:03:15,710 --> 01:03:18,030
I lived in this house
in my previous life.

1021
01:03:18,409 --> 01:03:19,999
I remembered...

1022
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:23,080
some high school boy
with curly hair...

1023
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:26,139
dancing to "Nobody" in this garden.

1024
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:33,010
Something's not right...

1025
01:03:35,029 --> 01:03:36,150
about that woman, Kim Ji Young.

1026
01:03:37,330 --> 01:03:38,450
Maybe she's...

1027
01:03:40,170 --> 01:03:41,220
That's right.

1028
01:03:42,670 --> 01:03:44,519
I need to find out who she is.

1029
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:49,299

01:05:51,295 --> 01:05:53,835
I heard that Ms. Kim...

1034
01:05:53,835 --> 01:05:55,885
was gravely injured two years ago.

1035
01:05:56,204 --> 01:05:58,484
The accident Ji Young was in?

1036
01:05:59,005 --> 01:06:01,180
What do you mean
about there being an odd rumor?

1037
01:06:01,204 --> 01:06:03,545
She wasn't
the Ji Young we remembered.

1038
01:06:03,545 --> 01:06:05,644
She was acting like
a completely different person.

1039
01:06:05,644 --> 01:06:08,784
Could you find out
where Park Do Ra's mother is?

1040
01:06:08,784 --> 01:06:10,905
How can there be
so many coincidences?
