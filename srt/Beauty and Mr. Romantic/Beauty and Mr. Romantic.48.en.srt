00:00:12,177 --> 00:00:13,547
Baby chick.

4
00:00:14,177 --> 00:00:15,746
Chirp.

(Soonjung Kalguksu)

6
00:00:22,674 --> 00:00:24,005
You like it?

7
00:00:24,744 --> 00:00:26,145
Stop it.

8
00:00:29,244 --> 00:00:30,544
Park Do Ra.

9
00:00:31,955 --> 00:00:33,284
Do Ra.

10
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:37,525
You've never once laughed at me
like that.

11
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:41,055
But why are you smiling
that brightly...

12
00:00:41,664 --> 00:00:43,695
at Ko Pil Seung?

13
00:00:44,865 --> 00:00:47,494
I'm suffering to the point
where I feel like I'm dying,

14
00:00:48,865 --> 00:00:51,235
so why won't you take my hand?

15
00:00:51,435 --> 00:00:52,835
Why not?

16
00:00:57,745 --> 00:01:00,244
Whose fault is it
that I ended up this way?

17
00:01:01,545 --> 00:01:03,585
If I had married Tae Hee,

18
00:01:03,884 --> 00:01:05,915
I wouldn't have hit rock bottom.

19
00:01:06,554 --> 00:01:08,785
Because of you, I lost everything.

20
00:01:08,785 --> 00:01:10,254
But Park Do Ra,

21
00:01:11,395 --> 00:01:13,054
there you are giggling...

22
00:01:14,025 --> 00:01:16,125
while holding another man's hands.

23
00:01:16,724 --> 00:01:18,034
Seriously?

24
00:01:38,284 --> 00:01:40,954
Hold on.
Are you saying he's on the run?

25
00:01:40,954 --> 00:01:45,095
That's right.
The police are after Gong Jin Dan.

26
00:01:45,624 --> 00:01:46,894
You can only imagine...

27
00:01:46,894 --> 00:01:49,100
how shocking this must be
for Chairman Gong.

28
00:01:49,124 --> 00:01:50,695
Someone who isn't even a Gong...

29
00:01:50,695 --> 00:01:54,095
took over the company
and embezzled its money.

30
00:01:54,605 --> 00:01:57,335
And his mother,
who is also your friend,

31
00:01:57,335 --> 00:01:58,974
was kicked out of the house.

32
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:00,174
Ma Ri said...

33
00:02:00,174 --> 00:02:02,444
the entire family
was turned upside down.

34
00:02:02,844 --> 00:02:04,844
Will he go to prison...

35
00:02:04,844 --> 00:02:07,275
if he gets caught?

36
00:02:07,275 --> 00:02:09,885
Of course.
Those who embezzle end up in prison.

37
00:02:09,885 --> 00:02:12,485
You hear about it all the time
in the news.

38
00:02:12,984 --> 00:02:14,131
My gosh.

39
00:02:14,155 --> 00:02:16,384
So, is Jin Sang Gu...

40
00:02:16,384 --> 00:02:19,931
on the run with Jin Jin Dan?
I can't reach him now.

41
00:02:19,955 --> 00:02:22,640
Right. That's what's going on.

42
00:02:22,664 --> 00:02:25,134
Since they are father and son,

43
00:02:25,134 --> 00:02:28,934
the three of them are
sticking together on the run.

44
00:02:29,604 --> 00:02:33,651
By the way, I have to do something
to make him pay the rent.

45
00:02:33,675 --> 00:02:35,275
What do you think I should do?

46
00:02:35,275 --> 00:02:36,804
I'll make sure to get the money.

47
00:02:38,745 --> 00:02:41,290
Grandma and Ms. Sun Young,
we're here.

48
00:02:41,314 --> 00:02:43,915
I'm here with Mom and Dad.

49
00:02:44,344 --> 00:02:45,631
- My gosh.
- Hey.

50
00:02:45,655 --> 00:02:47,455
Honey, stop eating.

51
00:02:47,455 --> 00:02:49,255
- You should go get the door.
- Okay.

52
00:02:49,455 --> 00:02:52,395
Chairman Gong, what brings you here
at this hour?

53
00:02:52,395 --> 00:02:55,241
You brought all your family too.

54
00:02:55,265 --> 00:02:57,124
If you had come a little earlier,

55
00:02:57,124 --> 00:03:00,094
we could've had
soy bean noodles together.

56
00:03:00,594 --> 00:03:03,705
So, did you have lunch?

57
00:03:04,705 --> 00:03:06,975
- Yes.
- So what brings you...

58
00:03:08,004 --> 00:03:09,705
to our place?

59
00:03:10,974 --> 00:03:12,815
Dad, tell them quickly.

60
00:03:13,675 --> 00:03:15,290
Is it good news?

61
00:03:15,314 --> 00:03:17,315
Your face says it's something good.

62
00:03:20,585 --> 00:03:24,455
Pil Seung's adoption
has been officially finalized today.

63
00:03:24,655 --> 00:03:26,994
The Family Court approved it.

64
00:03:28,194 --> 00:03:29,524
What?

65
00:03:30,094 --> 00:03:31,424
Adoption?

66
00:03:32,335 --> 00:03:34,965
I thought it was canceled already.

67
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:37,535
Why are you bringing it up
all of a sudden?

68
00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:40,775
Hyun Chul, what are you doing?

69
00:03:40,775 --> 00:03:43,181
You're being unbelievable,
Chairman Gong.

70
00:03:43,205 --> 00:03:44,920
You asked for an adoption,

71
00:03:44,944 --> 00:03:46,914
then you canceled it,
saying there was a problem.

72
00:03:46,914 --> 00:03:49,415
And now, even without consulting us,

73
00:03:50,245 --> 00:03:51,915
you adopted my son?

74
00:03:52,515 --> 00:03:54,885
What kind of nonsense is this?

75
00:03:59,224 --> 00:04:00,654
My apologies.

76
00:04:01,055 --> 00:04:02,371
It's true...

77
00:04:02,395 --> 00:04:06,434
that I gave it a second thought
because of Do Ra.

78
00:04:06,995 --> 00:04:09,804
I left the issue on one side
because of the company...

79
00:04:10,235 --> 00:04:12,334
and reconsidered it.

80
00:04:12,805 --> 00:04:14,575
But I never canceled it.

81
00:04:15,145 --> 00:04:17,320
Please don't get the wrong idea.

82
00:04:17,344 --> 00:04:19,844
How I trust
and care about Pil Seung...

83
00:04:19,914 --> 00:04:22,644
never changed. I mean it.

84
00:04:25,414 --> 00:04:29,061
Mr. Ko, can you please
give my dad a break just once?

85
00:04:29,085 --> 00:04:31,625
Please let Pil Seung be my brother.

86
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:34,155
Then I can be your daughter too.

87
00:04:34,155 --> 00:04:36,195
I'll be a good daughter to you.

88
00:04:36,195 --> 00:04:39,334
And I'll call you Dad.

89
00:04:39,695 --> 00:04:42,234
So, please do me a favor...

90
00:04:42,234 --> 00:04:45,274
and let Pil Seung be my brother.

91
00:04:45,835 --> 00:04:47,875
- Dad.
- What?

92
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,921
- What...
- My goodness.

93
00:04:50,945 --> 00:04:52,344
Listen, Hyun Chul.

94
00:04:52,344 --> 00:04:56,720
You've always said
you wanted to have a sweet daughter.

95
00:04:56,744 --> 00:05:00,385
And your wish finally came true
without even trying.

96
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:05,655
Please forgive my other dad
this once. Okay?

97
00:05:05,655 --> 00:05:07,195
I'm begging you.

98
00:05:08,265 --> 00:05:09,894
Dad, please.

99
00:05:11,594 --> 00:05:13,335
Oh, dear.

100
00:05:13,335 --> 00:05:15,005
Hyun Chul.

101
00:05:15,005 --> 00:05:18,335
Your sweet daughter is begging you.
Just do her a favor.

102
00:05:18,335 --> 00:05:20,304
My gosh, I just...

103
00:05:20,304 --> 00:05:22,780
I can't believe this. My goodness.

104
00:05:22,804 --> 00:05:25,544
- Just answer her question.
- Were you shocked?

105
00:05:26,775 --> 00:05:28,844
Our sweet Ma Ri.

106
00:05:34,614 --> 00:05:36,084
All right.

107
00:05:36,155 --> 00:05:38,379
We used to do it like that.

108
00:05:38,403 --> 00:05:40,243
(Chairman Gong Jin Taek)

109
00:05:49,034 --> 00:05:50,381
Hello, Chairman Gong.

110
00:05:50,405 --> 00:05:53,435
I need you to come
to GOGO Entertainment tomorrow.

111
00:05:53,635 --> 00:05:56,844
Pardon? What do you mean?

112
00:05:57,075 --> 00:05:59,291
I haven't accepted
your resignation yet.

113
00:05:59,315 --> 00:06:01,414
I'm telling you to come back
to where you belong.

114
00:06:01,585 --> 00:06:02,945
I'll see you tomorrow.

115
00:06:03,945 --> 00:06:06,691
Well... Yes, Chairman Gong.

116
00:06:06,715 --> 00:06:08,084
Okay.

117
00:06:09,155 --> 00:06:11,084
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?

118
00:06:12,724 --> 00:06:16,224
Chairman Gong says
he hasn't accepted my resignation,

119
00:06:16,465 --> 00:06:19,135
and he wants me to start working
at GOGO Entertainment again tomorrow.

120
00:06:19,734 --> 00:06:21,094
Really?

121
00:06:25,674 --> 00:06:27,804
Congratulations, Pil Seung!

122
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,644
I'm so happy for you.

123
00:06:32,674 --> 00:06:34,215
- My goodness.
- I can't believe this.

124
00:06:34,215 --> 00:06:35,715
That's enough.

125
00:06:35,715 --> 00:06:38,530
You just cuddle and hold hands
whenever you can. I can't stand it.

126
00:06:38,554 --> 00:06:41,561
Why? It's not true
we're doing it whenever we can.

127
00:06:41,585 --> 00:06:42,885
Do Ra is right about that.

128
00:06:42,885 --> 00:06:44,184
- We're not like that.
- He's right.

129
00:06:44,184 --> 00:06:48,024
Do you want me to list
what you've done one by one?

130
00:06:58,534 --> 00:07:01,104
Congratulations, Pil Seung.

131
00:07:02,174 --> 00:07:05,075
Actually,
I've been feeling bad for you.

132
00:07:05,075 --> 00:07:06,375
After you left the company,

133
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,145
you just did the dishes
and made dough here.

134
00:07:08,145 --> 00:07:10,515
I felt bad
when I saw you do all the work.

135
00:07:10,945 --> 00:07:13,354
- I'm happy for you.
- Thank you.

136
00:07:14,715 --> 00:07:17,125
- I'm worried though.
- What?

137
00:07:17,955 --> 00:07:19,931
How are you going to make dough
starting from tomorrow?

138
00:07:19,955 --> 00:07:22,695
Ms. Soon Jung told me to knead it
a lot to make it chewy.

139
00:07:22,695 --> 00:07:24,125
Who is going to do that?

140
00:07:24,965 --> 00:07:26,865
What is he talking about?

141
00:07:27,635 --> 00:07:30,205
Gosh. How silly.

142
00:07:30,335 --> 00:07:32,505
That's not a problem.
I can knead the dough.

143
00:07:32,505 --> 00:07:36,774
I wonder
how he even won such a big award.

144
00:07:37,445 --> 00:07:38,774
What?

145
00:07:41,315 --> 00:07:42,685
I know.

146
00:07:42,914 --> 00:07:45,015
What a silly man he is.

147
00:07:45,585 --> 00:07:46,885
Hello, Dad.

148
00:07:46,955 --> 00:07:50,455
Hey, Pil Seung.
Chairman Gong just stopped by.

149
00:07:51,594 --> 00:07:53,001
He says...

150
00:07:53,025 --> 00:07:55,425
your adoption
has been finalized today.

151
00:07:56,164 --> 00:07:57,865
Just a heads-up.

152
00:08:00,364 --> 00:08:01,695
Dad.

153
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:05,505
We're fine.

154
00:08:06,575 --> 00:08:09,274
Yes. I believe you'll do well.

155
00:08:09,474 --> 00:08:13,144
Don't forget
that we all have your back.

156
00:08:16,284 --> 00:08:19,084
Thank you, Dad.

00:08:34,537 --> 00:08:36,540
(Dementia Relief Center)

158
00:08:36,565 --> 00:08:38,205
Hello, Ms. Lee Soon Jung.

159
00:08:38,205 --> 00:08:40,405
Yes, hello.

160
00:08:41,034 --> 00:08:44,174
Grandma, have a lot of fun
with your friends today.

161
00:08:44,174 --> 00:08:46,544
Okay. Don't worry about me and go.

162
00:08:46,544 --> 00:08:49,045
- I'll see you later.
- See you.

163
00:08:50,314 --> 00:08:51,614
Let's go.

164
00:09:10,135 --> 00:09:11,464
Do Jun.

165
00:09:11,735 --> 00:09:13,075
Ma Ri.

166
00:09:14,005 --> 00:09:15,744
How long have you been following me?

167
00:09:16,704 --> 00:09:19,145
Since you left home.

168
00:09:19,745 --> 00:09:21,045
What?

169
00:09:22,814 --> 00:09:24,514
Why are you being like this?

170
00:09:25,554 --> 00:09:29,224
I told you. I miss you every day.

171
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:34,425
Ma Ri, how many times
do I have to tell you to stop it?

172
00:09:35,495 --> 00:09:36,895
Why do I have to stop?

173
00:09:36,964 --> 00:09:39,594
Did you not miss me at all?

174
00:09:40,694 --> 00:09:42,834
I thought we were into each other.

175
00:09:48,345 --> 00:09:49,874
We're broken up.

176
00:09:50,845 --> 00:09:53,075
Even though we had feelings
for each other,

177
00:09:53,745 --> 00:09:55,621
we're not supposed to see each other
after breaking up.

178
00:09:55,645 --> 00:09:59,091
But we didn't break up.
We were forced to do so.

179
00:09:59,115 --> 00:10:01,254
Still, we're broken up.

180
00:10:06,225 --> 00:10:07,655
Do Jun.

181
00:10:09,664 --> 00:10:11,895
Can't we just
get back together again?

182
00:10:12,564 --> 00:10:14,094
Hey, Ma Ri.

183
00:10:15,735 --> 00:10:17,640
Do you not know why we broke up?

184
00:10:17,664 --> 00:10:20,575
I know. It's because of your mom.

185
00:10:20,605 --> 00:10:23,645
But why do we have to break up
because of your mom?

186
00:10:24,745 --> 00:10:26,114
Ma Ri.

187
00:10:27,275 --> 00:10:29,445
You being like this
makes things harder for me.

188
00:10:30,314 --> 00:10:32,614
So, please stop coming to see me.

189
00:10:33,454 --> 00:10:35,455
This doesn't change anything.

190
00:10:35,584 --> 00:10:38,124
Just be patient even if you miss me.

191
00:10:39,525 --> 00:10:40,925
And move on.

192
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,234
Move on?

193
00:10:47,495 --> 00:10:49,065
How would I move on?

194
00:10:49,164 --> 00:10:51,104
Can you get over me?

195
00:10:52,204 --> 00:10:55,881
If there's a way to get over you,
just tell me.

196
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,305
I...

197
00:10:57,645 --> 00:11:02,185
I just don't know
how to move on, Do Jun.

198
00:11:18,834 --> 00:11:20,111
What?

199
00:11:20,135 --> 00:11:23,535
Did Ma Ri follow Mr. Park around
again today?

200
00:11:23,704 --> 00:11:25,035
Yes.

201
00:11:25,135 --> 00:11:28,634
I sent the photos of her
to your phone.

202
00:11:29,405 --> 00:11:32,251
Okay, keep a close eye on her.

203
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,675
Yes, ma'am.

204
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:19,955
Hey.

205
00:12:21,395 --> 00:12:22,764
Gong Ma Ri.

206
00:12:24,794 --> 00:12:26,094
You...

207
00:12:26,434 --> 00:12:29,264
You follow Do Jun around
in secret and stare at him?

208
00:12:29,905 --> 00:12:33,834
Why would you do that?
Do Jun said he didn't like you.

209
00:12:34,534 --> 00:12:37,005
It's not that he doesn't like me.

210
00:12:37,005 --> 00:12:38,714
It's because of you and Dad.

211
00:12:38,714 --> 00:12:42,484
You and Dad
called him and his mom frauds.

212
00:12:44,284 --> 00:12:46,814
Mom. Do Jun's not like that.

213
00:12:46,814 --> 00:12:50,724
He didn't gang up on me
with his mom to use me.

214
00:12:51,324 --> 00:12:54,724
I know very well
that Do Jun's not like that.

215
00:12:54,824 --> 00:12:56,371
But Ma Ri,

216
00:12:56,395 --> 00:12:57,694
the character of the parents...

217
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:00,734
of the man you date
is important too.

218
00:13:01,164 --> 00:13:03,804
Do Jun's mom
got you to give her money,

219
00:13:03,804 --> 00:13:07,504
so, how could Mom and Dad
allow you to date him?

220
00:13:08,074 --> 00:13:12,275
That makes Do Jun's mom bad,
not Do Jun.

221
00:13:13,515 --> 00:13:14,591
Ma Ri.

222
00:13:14,615 --> 00:13:15,885
Does that mean...

223
00:13:15,885 --> 00:13:19,914
Do Jun can never be in love or marry
because of his mom?

224
00:13:19,914 --> 00:13:21,554
What did he do to deserve that?

225
00:13:21,554 --> 00:13:23,855
If he could've chosen his mom,

226
00:13:23,855 --> 00:13:26,754
he wouldn't have wanted
to be born to someone like that.

227
00:13:29,495 --> 00:13:32,164
Yes, you might be right
about that, but...

228
00:13:32,164 --> 00:13:33,535
Mom.

229
00:13:37,265 --> 00:13:39,634
I like Do Jun so much.

230
00:13:40,534 --> 00:13:43,905
Will you meet with him
and talk to him?

231
00:13:43,905 --> 00:13:46,015
Apologize for firing him,

232
00:13:46,015 --> 00:13:49,491
and say you're sorry
that Dad shouted at him.

233
00:13:49,515 --> 00:13:50,815
And...

234
00:13:53,084 --> 00:13:55,525
tell him to see me again.

235
00:13:56,255 --> 00:13:57,530
Please?

236
00:13:57,554 --> 00:13:59,124
Mom.

237
00:13:59,554 --> 00:14:01,724
What got into you?

238
00:14:04,164 --> 00:14:06,395
Why are you doing this, Ma Ri?

239
00:14:07,823 --> 00:14:10,735
(Chairman Gong Jin Taek)

240
00:14:12,635 --> 00:14:13,935
Yes?

241
00:14:16,275 --> 00:14:17,575
Hello.

242
00:14:18,615 --> 00:14:21,214
Yes. Welcome.

243
00:14:21,475 --> 00:14:23,214
Take a seat.

244
00:14:28,885 --> 00:14:30,525
I thought...

245
00:14:30,985 --> 00:14:33,430
my Ma Ri was over Do Jun.

246
00:14:33,454 --> 00:14:35,565
It seems not to be the case.

247
00:14:36,924 --> 00:14:41,165
She went to your home
and restaurant almost every day.

248
00:14:42,334 --> 00:14:43,634
So,

249
00:14:44,334 --> 00:14:49,205
I asked to see you to discuss...

250
00:14:49,275 --> 00:14:52,415
what we should do
about Ma Ri and Do Jun.

251
00:14:56,284 --> 00:14:59,655
The truth is, both my wife and I...

252
00:15:00,684 --> 00:15:02,825
thought highly of Do Jun.

253
00:15:03,284 --> 00:15:06,325
He was nice,
polite, and hard-working.

254
00:15:08,554 --> 00:15:12,494
But what your mother did
last time...

255
00:15:13,735 --> 00:15:17,864
I just can't wrap my head around it.

256
00:15:20,304 --> 00:15:21,604
How could I...

257
00:15:22,105 --> 00:15:25,344
allow my daughter to see him
after that?

258
00:15:26,944 --> 00:15:29,785
My heart breaks over this as well.

259
00:15:30,914 --> 00:15:32,914
My brother Do Jun likes Ma Ri,

260
00:15:32,914 --> 00:15:34,455
but because of our mom,

261
00:15:35,214 --> 00:15:37,884
he's forcing himself to reject her.

262
00:15:39,794 --> 00:15:41,124
Sir.

263
00:15:41,855 --> 00:15:43,395
If this is because of my mother,

264
00:15:43,395 --> 00:15:45,565
don't worry and accept Do Jun.

265
00:15:46,164 --> 00:15:48,764
After what happened,
us three siblings...

266
00:15:50,135 --> 00:15:51,665
cut ties with our mom.

267
00:15:52,735 --> 00:15:54,834
We don't even see her.

268
00:15:58,405 --> 00:16:00,974
If you're still
concerned about that,

269
00:16:04,044 --> 00:16:06,354
I'll cut ties with Do Jun too.

270
00:16:06,914 --> 00:16:09,424
So, let the two be together.

271
00:16:09,424 --> 00:16:11,124
Please, sir.

272
00:16:21,334 --> 00:16:22,705
Who is it?

273
00:16:23,635 --> 00:16:26,475
Do Jun, it's me.
Open the door quick.

274
00:16:26,475 --> 00:16:27,834
Gong Ma Ri?

275
00:16:31,005 --> 00:16:32,374
Ma Ri, you...

276
00:16:33,714 --> 00:16:34,845
Do Jun.

277
00:16:34,845 --> 00:16:37,114
What's going on? Is something wrong?

278
00:16:37,385 --> 00:16:39,284
Do Jun, we can see each other again.

279
00:16:39,284 --> 00:16:41,014
My dad gave permission.

280
00:16:41,515 --> 00:16:44,424
Don't say you want
to break up with me anymore.

281
00:16:44,424 --> 00:16:47,624
Keep your promise
and protect me forever.

282
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:52,964
Ma Ri.

283
00:17:19,895 --> 00:17:21,955
It blows to be in hiding
for so long.

284
00:17:23,224 --> 00:17:25,425
All I get to eat is bread.

285
00:17:28,734 --> 00:17:31,004
This is no life for a man.

286
00:17:35,075 --> 00:17:36,281
(International Call)

287
00:17:37,605 --> 00:17:39,944
Jackson, it's me.

288
00:17:39,944 --> 00:17:41,914
Sorry I couldn't make it last time.

289
00:17:41,914 --> 00:17:43,714
I just need more time here.

290
00:17:44,484 --> 00:17:46,514
Are you on what I asked for?

291
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:48,284
Stay on it.

292
00:17:48,514 --> 00:17:51,224
Mr. Gong. You're in deep trouble.

293
00:17:54,655 --> 00:17:58,224
The shell company, Spring,
is now under Interpol investigation.

294
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,365
They know that it's yours.

295
00:18:01,494 --> 00:18:03,734
- What?
- Don't drag me into this.

296
00:18:03,805 --> 00:18:05,734
Sorry. I'm out of this.

297
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:08,135
Jackson!

298
00:18:08,434 --> 00:18:10,004
What the heck?

299
00:18:13,474 --> 00:18:14,845
What's happening?

300
00:18:15,914 --> 00:18:17,244
Then...

301
00:18:18,085 --> 00:18:20,554
did I lose
the Hong Kong paper company too?

302
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:07,413
(Queen Mother)

303
00:19:15,209 --> 00:19:16,549
Mom.

304
00:19:19,518 --> 00:19:20,818
Mom.

305
00:19:21,649 --> 00:19:25,549
Mom!

306
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:35,299
Eat all you want, Mom.

307
00:19:35,798 --> 00:19:37,628
You like raw halibut.

308
00:19:42,509 --> 00:19:43,868
It's delicious.

309
00:19:44,608 --> 00:19:46,779
Eat up. You like this too.

310
00:19:50,578 --> 00:19:53,519
I can live
now that I get to see you.

311
00:19:54,018 --> 00:19:56,219
Do you know how worried I was?

312
00:19:56,489 --> 00:19:58,289
Why worry about me?

313
00:19:58,848 --> 00:20:00,618
Worry about yourself.

314
00:20:01,358 --> 00:20:04,229
Why aren't you eating?
You like this too.

315
00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:08,428
I am eating. You should eat more.

316
00:20:09,598 --> 00:20:11,368
When do you go to Hong Kong?

317
00:20:11,969 --> 00:20:14,039
Are you still looking for a boat?

318
00:20:14,368 --> 00:20:15,668
What?

319
00:20:16,338 --> 00:20:17,668
Oh, that?

320
00:20:18,538 --> 00:20:19,939
No.

321
00:20:20,409 --> 00:20:22,709
I leave tonight.

322
00:20:23,409 --> 00:20:25,108
That's why I asked to see you.

323
00:20:27,078 --> 00:20:28,779
Since we can't meet for a while.

324
00:20:29,449 --> 00:20:32,118
What? You leave tonight?

325
00:20:33,788 --> 00:20:35,189
Mom.

326
00:20:35,219 --> 00:20:38,088
It might take me a long time
to get to Hong Kong...

327
00:20:38,088 --> 00:20:39,928
and settle down.

328
00:20:40,098 --> 00:20:43,368
So, remember, no news is good news.

329
00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:47,598
Even if you can't reach me,
don't worry and wait, okay?

330
00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:51,009
And...

331
00:20:52,378 --> 00:20:53,485
Mom.

332
00:20:53,509 --> 00:20:55,078
Sell this if you need money.

333
00:20:55,078 --> 00:20:57,048
I got it for 100,000 dollars,

334
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:58,949
so don't sell it
for anything under half that.

335
00:20:58,949 --> 00:21:00,249
Okay?

336
00:21:01,249 --> 00:21:02,888
Why are you saying that?

337
00:21:03,149 --> 00:21:05,348
You sound like
you'll never come back.

338
00:21:07,659 --> 00:21:09,219
I think...

339
00:21:10,889 --> 00:21:14,059
I might be away for a long time.

340
00:21:15,128 --> 00:21:17,199
My accounts are frozen,

341
00:21:17,368 --> 00:21:19,598
so I might not be able
to send you money.

342
00:21:20,298 --> 00:21:23,469
Even if you don't hear from me,
don't worry.

343
00:21:23,608 --> 00:21:24,945
Okay?

344
00:21:24,969 --> 00:21:26,939
Don't cry.

345
00:21:27,308 --> 00:21:29,209
Look after yourself.

346
00:21:29,649 --> 00:21:30,949
Okay?

347
00:21:31,378 --> 00:21:32,749
Okay.

348
00:21:32,778 --> 00:21:36,249
But promise to call me
to where you are.

349
00:21:36,618 --> 00:21:38,418
Call me soon.

350
00:21:38,719 --> 00:21:41,418
It's getting hard for me
to survive each day.

351
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,229
I can't do without you.

352
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:46,398
Mom.

353
00:21:47,128 --> 00:21:50,199
Please stop saying
that you can't live without me.

354
00:21:51,098 --> 00:21:52,628
Are you a kid?

355
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:54,469
Are you in kindergarten?

356
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:58,039
How can I leave if you say that?

357
00:21:58,568 --> 00:22:00,009
Okay.

358
00:22:00,578 --> 00:22:02,279
Why are you crying?

359
00:22:02,308 --> 00:22:04,949
Because you're all upset.

360
00:22:05,778 --> 00:22:07,949
You need to stay strong...

361
00:22:07,949 --> 00:22:09,848
for me to leave with ease.

362
00:22:10,618 --> 00:22:12,088
Okay.

363
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:15,435
I'll stay strong,

364
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,189
so don't worry about me.

365
00:22:22,729 --> 00:22:24,969
Dry your tears and eat up.

366
00:22:30,268 --> 00:22:31,969
Please don't cry.

367
00:22:44,901 --> 00:22:47,141
No way. We're already here.

368
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,871
I know.

369
00:22:50,141 --> 00:22:51,671
Should we walk
around the neighborhood again?

370
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,141
Wait.

371
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,711
You have to be
at the office tomorrow.

372
00:22:56,081 --> 00:22:57,981
So get going. It's already late.

373
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,710
I need to wash up
and go to bed early...

374
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,850
to make and sell kalguksu tomorrow.

375
00:23:04,851 --> 00:23:06,221
Sure thing.

376
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,206
My baby chick, here's
to surviving another tough day.

377
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,661
Sleep tight.

378
00:23:11,831 --> 00:23:13,231
You too.

379
00:23:13,661 --> 00:23:14,961
Chirp.

380
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,830
What?

381
00:23:17,371 --> 00:23:19,701
You're chirping on your own now.

382
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:22,077
You've rubbed off on me.

383
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:23,810
It just comes out.

384
00:23:24,441 --> 00:23:27,310
Anyway, who's going to make
the kalgusu dough from now on?

385
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,786
I'm worried sick.

386
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,050
Stop it.

387
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,881
Why would you worry about that?

388
00:23:33,081 --> 00:23:37,350
We'll handle things at the diner,
so don't worry. Got it?

389
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,951
Now, head home.

390
00:23:40,391 --> 00:23:41,891
Head inside first, then.

391
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,961
But we're outside my place.

392
00:23:45,331 --> 00:23:47,961
I'll only be at ease
once I see you get going.

393
00:23:49,631 --> 00:23:51,931
Fine. I'll be on my way.

394
00:24:00,441 --> 00:24:01,780
Bye.

395
00:24:11,421 --> 00:24:12,790
Good night.

396
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,721
Good night, Pil Seung.

397
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,621
Park Do Ra!

398
00:24:45,591 --> 00:24:47,060
We need to talk.

399
00:24:49,191 --> 00:24:50,830
I have nothing to say to you.

400
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,830
Park Do Ra.

401
00:24:54,401 --> 00:24:57,201
Fine, I get it.
You don't have to talk.

402
00:24:58,601 --> 00:25:00,201
But...

403
00:25:00,871 --> 00:25:02,570
have a meal with me.

404
00:25:04,071 --> 00:25:06,911
No, I don't want to.

405
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,716
So, please leave.

406
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,350
This is my last request.

407
00:25:13,581 --> 00:25:15,421
Could you at least hold my hand?

408
00:25:20,191 --> 00:25:21,621
Are you out of your mind?

409
00:25:22,361 --> 00:25:24,460
Stop it already!

410
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,830
Hey!

411
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:29,330
I said it was my last request.

412
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:32,431
Is it that hard for you
to hold my hand?

413
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,540
Then, have a meal with me.

414
00:25:37,571 --> 00:25:39,347
Have one meal with me.

415
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,657
Let go.

416
00:25:40,681 --> 00:25:43,087
Let go of me.

417
00:25:43,111 --> 00:25:44,681
Let go of me!

418
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:47,221
Let go!

419
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,191
Do Ra!

420
00:25:58,931 --> 00:26:01,461
Do Ra...

421
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,681
Where are we?

422
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,510
Where are you taking me?

423
00:26:58,121 --> 00:26:59,421
Pull over.

424
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,020
Pull over!

425
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,961
Don't yell at me!

426
00:27:05,391 --> 00:27:09,030
I have no intention of harming you.

427
00:27:10,431 --> 00:27:12,171
Before I die,

428
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,641
I want to have a cup of tea
with you,

429
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:19,310
say what I didn't get to say,

430
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,810
and have a meal with you.

431
00:27:25,411 --> 00:27:27,881
You're not in your right mind.

432
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,797
You're insane!

433
00:27:31,821 --> 00:27:34,961
That's right. I'm insane.

434
00:27:35,161 --> 00:27:39,131
So, when I asked you
to take my hand,

435
00:27:39,131 --> 00:27:41,000
you should have!

436
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,530
Are my hands too filthy for you?

437
00:27:45,171 --> 00:27:46,901
You take Ko Pil Seung's hands
all the time,

438
00:27:46,901 --> 00:27:48,671
so why not mine?

439
00:27:51,071 --> 00:27:53,341
You eat with him
and smile at him all the time,

440
00:27:53,341 --> 00:27:55,110
but why won't you do the same
for me?

441
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:59,250
It's not like I asked for 100 meals.

442
00:28:00,351 --> 00:28:01,750
Just one.

443
00:28:02,081 --> 00:28:04,950
Just be nice to me
this one last time!

444
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,550
No.

445
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:09,020
I don't want to!

446
00:28:10,931 --> 00:28:12,260
Is that so?

447
00:28:13,601 --> 00:28:15,060
Do you hate me that much?

448
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,471
Actually, it's for the best.

449
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,241
I would've been bored...

450
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,810
on my way to the afterlife,

451
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,641
but you'll accompany me...

452
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,850
to the afterlife.

453
00:28:40,621 --> 00:28:42,121
What are you doing?

454
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,461
Pull over!

455
00:28:50,871 --> 00:28:53,206
Pull over!

456
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,741
Pull over!

457
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,171
Pull over!

458
00:29:22,931 --> 00:29:24,330
What...

459
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,661
Park Do Ra.

460
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:54,860
Park Do Ra...

461
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,631
Do Ra.

462
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,981
Do Ra.

463
00:30:08,911 --> 00:30:11,250
Do Ra? Park Do Ra.

464
00:30:14,821 --> 00:30:16,121
Do Ra?

465
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:19,391
Park Do Ra!

466
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,320
Park Do Ra.

467
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,661
Park Do Ra.

468
00:30:37,941 --> 00:30:39,310
Do Ra?

469
00:30:40,911 --> 00:30:42,241
Park Do Ra!

470
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:17,241
All right.

471
00:31:22,851 --> 00:31:25,090
Do Ra, what are you doing?

472
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,060
What?

473
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,371
Is she asleep?

474
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:45,871
You sleeping beauty.

475
00:31:46,411 --> 00:31:48,280
Goodnight, my baby chick.

476
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,141
Sweet dreams.

477
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:07,600
How far are we going?

478
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,461
We're going over there.

479
00:32:12,601 --> 00:32:14,841
- Wait, honey.
- Yes?

480
00:32:14,841 --> 00:32:16,701
Isn't that a car?

481
00:32:17,571 --> 00:32:19,540
- What?
- Gosh, honey. That's...

482
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,681
- I think there was an accident.
- My goodness.

483
00:32:22,911 --> 00:32:25,310
- Be careful.
- Okay, it's fine.

484
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:29,050
Honey, look at that.

485
00:32:29,651 --> 00:32:31,790
- What?
- There's a dead person.

486
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,520
Don't go.

487
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,520
Just wait there.

488
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:38,790
- Don't go near her.
- How is...

489
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,877
Be careful.

490
00:32:41,901 --> 00:32:43,401
Are you all right?

491
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,500
Wake up.

492
00:32:51,371 --> 00:32:53,171
She's alive!

493
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,980
- She is alive!
- Is she?

494
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:57,780
Yes. Call the ambulance, honey!

495
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:00,327
- Are you all right?
- Hang on.

496
00:33:00,351 --> 00:33:02,351
- Hurry!
- Okay.

497
00:33:02,351 --> 00:33:03,721
Are you okay?

498
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,891
Oh, dear.

499
00:33:11,891 --> 00:33:14,631
- Mom, give me that.
- Leave me alone.

500
00:33:14,631 --> 00:33:17,260
- My gosh.
- Let me do it.

501
00:33:17,431 --> 00:33:19,631
Isn't Ji Young up yet?

502
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:23,741
She went out on a date
with Director Ko yesterday.

503
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,171
And she didn't come home.

504
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:30,341
When Ji Young comes home,
just pretend not to know.

505
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:33,181
She must be shy.

506
00:33:33,181 --> 00:33:34,881
Are you serious?

507
00:33:34,881 --> 00:33:36,921
Of course, I am.

508
00:33:36,921 --> 00:33:41,191
I'm sure
they got to second base last night.

509
00:33:41,191 --> 00:33:43,891
Come on, Mom. What second base?

510
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,831
But she would've at least called you
so you wouldn't worry.

511
00:33:46,831 --> 00:33:48,361
It's strange she didn't call.

512
00:33:48,361 --> 00:33:49,731
You're right.

513
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,931
Wait.

514
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,317
She's not answering.

515
00:33:59,341 --> 00:34:00,587
She isn't?

516
00:34:00,611 --> 00:34:03,611
- Just leave her be.
- The person you have reached is...

517
00:34:03,611 --> 00:34:08,381
Why are you being so tactless?

518
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,750
Don't disturb them.

519
00:34:12,321 --> 00:34:13,750
Wait, my phone is ringing.

520
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,060
What?

521
00:34:15,391 --> 00:34:16,991
Hello?

522
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,190
Is this Ms. Park Do Ra's family?

523
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:21,800
Yes, I am. Who is this?

524
00:34:27,801 --> 00:34:29,271
What?

525
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:37,241
Hey. Come on in.

526
00:34:39,011 --> 00:34:40,311
All right.

527
00:34:41,421 --> 00:34:43,021
- Have a seat.
- Yes, sir.

528
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,690
I'll now call you...

529
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:53,730
Pil Seung.

530
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,107
You're my son now.

531
00:34:56,131 --> 00:34:57,730
You don't mind, do you?

532
00:34:58,801 --> 00:35:01,641
Of course not. Please.

533
00:35:02,171 --> 00:35:06,041
And I want you to be comfortable
around me like your dad.

534
00:35:08,341 --> 00:35:09,940
Okay. I will.

535
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,891
And...

536
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,991
don't tell my wife.

537
00:35:21,591 --> 00:35:25,230
Actually, I've always wanted a son.

538
00:35:25,991 --> 00:35:27,460
And now,

539
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,070
I have a reliable and great son
like you.

540
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:34,741
I'm...

541
00:35:35,201 --> 00:35:37,940
so thrilled and happy.

542
00:35:38,841 --> 00:35:41,641
I hope we will get along well.

543
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:45,780
I hope so too.

544
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:49,120
And we should have...

545
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,021
dinner together sometime with Do Ra.

546
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,531
Yes. Sure.

547
00:35:57,531 --> 00:36:00,831
I will have it arranged soon.

548
00:36:01,531 --> 00:36:03,161
Thank you, Chairman Gong.

549
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,826
Gosh, you're making me shy.

550
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:22,520
We've been waiting
for your comeback.

551
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,050
I'm so glad that you're back.

552
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:27,620
Why are you being like this?

553
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:30,221
Director Ko. I mean, CEO Ko.

554
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:32,561
Thank you for coming back.

555
00:36:32,861 --> 00:36:35,031
If you hadn't come back this month,

556
00:36:35,031 --> 00:36:37,260
I would've moved to another company.

557
00:36:38,631 --> 00:36:40,507
Thank you all for what you've done.

558
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,670
Let's work hard together again!

559
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:45,840
- Let's do it!
- Let's do it!

560

is unavailable.

561

my baby chick. Sweet dreams.)

563
00:37:27,716 --> 00:37:29,817
Why isn't Do Ra answering my calls?

564
00:37:30,846 --> 00:37:32,416
She didn't check my message either.

565
00:37:36,256 --> 00:37:38,226
Did something happen?

566
00:37:43,556 --> 00:37:45,226

Do Ra...

571
00:37:56,006 --> 00:37:58,706
Do Sik, what's wrong?

572
00:37:59,647 --> 00:38:01,106
Say what it is.

573
00:38:01,417 --> 00:38:02,822
What about Do Ra?

574
00:38:02,846 --> 00:38:04,947
Do Ra had an accident.

575
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:09,286
What?

579
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,521
Do Sik.

580
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,990
What happened?

581
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,291
Why did Do Ra have an accident?

582
00:38:32,491 --> 00:38:34,491
I don't know.
They are investigating it.

583
00:38:34,491 --> 00:38:36,790
They say Do Ra was
in an unregistered vehicle,

584
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,701
and they don't even know
who was driving it.

585
00:38:38,701 --> 00:38:40,801
It's unknown
why Do Ra was in the car.

586
00:38:40,801 --> 00:38:42,370
I don't know what's going on.

587
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:44,170
What do we do?

588
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,340
An unregistered vehicle?

589
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:48,470
What are you talking about?

590
00:38:49,111 --> 00:38:50,341
- I don't know.
- Excuse me.

591
00:38:50,341 --> 00:38:52,111
Are you Ms. Park Do Ra's family?

592
00:38:52,111 --> 00:38:54,080
Yes. I'm her older brother.

593
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,280
Hello. I'm a cop.

594
00:38:56,681 --> 00:38:58,110
Do you...

595
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,581
recognize this man?

596
00:39:03,951 --> 00:39:05,366
Yes, I do.

597
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:08,661
His name is Gong Jin Dan.

598
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:11,161
He's the CEO
of Angel Investment Corp.

599
00:39:12,031 --> 00:39:13,331
I see.

600
00:39:14,031 --> 00:39:15,500
We checked the CCTV footage
from the elevator...

601
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,501
and found out he kidnapped her
in front of the house.

602
00:39:18,571 --> 00:39:22,016
And we confirmed
that he fled the accident scene...

603
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,811
leaving Park Do Ra alone.

604
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,587
Gong Jin Dan?

605
00:39:26,611 --> 00:39:28,041
Yes.

606
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:33,451
Pil Seung,
I'm going to kill that jerk.

607
00:39:33,951 --> 00:39:34,951
Do Sik.

608
00:39:34,951 --> 00:39:37,850
You know
what that jerk did to Do Ra!

609
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:39,821
- Do Sik.
- I swear I'm going to kill him.

610
00:39:39,821 --> 00:39:43,530
Do Sik, calm yourself down.

611
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,731
Calm down.

612
00:39:51,971 --> 00:39:53,801
This is my card.

613
00:39:53,801 --> 00:39:55,711
Please call me if anything happens.

614
00:39:55,841 --> 00:39:57,210
I'll give you my full cooperation.

615
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:59,280
Okay. We will.

617
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,590
Oh, hello.

618
00:40:10,697 --> 00:40:13,997
Doctor. How did the surgery go?
Did it go well?

619
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:16,843
It looks like she'll pull through,
fortunately.

620
00:40:16,867 --> 00:40:18,707
- Thank you.
- But...

621
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:21,676
she suffered multiple fractures.

622
00:40:22,007 --> 00:40:23,776
I can't guarantee...

623
00:40:24,476 --> 00:40:26,316
she will walk again.

624
00:40:27,746 --> 00:40:31,087
What? Doctor, what...

625
00:40:31,586 --> 00:40:33,456
What do you mean by that?

626
00:40:33,456 --> 00:40:36,626
You mean she can't walk again?

627
00:40:36,626 --> 00:40:38,896
No, right?
I heard you wrong, didn't I?

628
00:40:38,896 --> 00:40:41,596
Let's see how she does.

629
00:40:44,496 --> 00:40:45,897

630
00:40:46,896 --> 00:40:48,236
How come...

631

What was that about?
Why can't Do Ra walk again?

632
00:40:55,137 --> 00:40:57,006
Why not?

633
00:40:57,206 --> 00:40:59,717
- I'll find him and kill him.
- Do Sik.

634
00:40:59,717 --> 00:41:01,977
- I'll kill him!
- No!

635
00:41:02,816 --> 00:41:04,187
Get a grip.

636
00:41:04,947 --> 00:41:06,557
Not our Do Ra.

637
00:41:07,487 --> 00:41:10,756
She will walk again,
so don't you even think...

638
00:41:11,557 --> 00:41:14,026
she might never walk again, okay?

00:48:03,087 --> 00:48:04,687
Here you go.

736
00:48:04,746 --> 00:48:06,187
- Here.
- My gosh.

737
00:48:07,157 --> 00:48:08,687
Thank you.

738
00:48:09,357 --> 00:48:10,903
Did you read about Park Do Ra?

739
00:48:10,927 --> 00:48:14,827
She might never walk again
because of some lunatic.

740
00:48:17,666 --> 00:48:19,567
Do Ra can't walk?

741
00:48:19,567 --> 00:48:21,396
That lunatic.

742
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:26,106
He's the second son
of APP Group's former chairman.

743
00:48:26,876 --> 00:48:28,477
APP Group?

744
00:48:28,876 --> 00:48:30,807
Gong Jin Dan?

745
00:48:31,646 --> 00:48:33,477
Excuse me.

746
00:48:33,876 --> 00:48:36,787
Is what you said true?

747
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:41,417
About my daughter Do Ra
not being able to walk.

748
00:48:41,686 --> 00:48:43,503
"My daughter Do Ra?"

749
00:48:43,527 --> 00:48:46,157
My gosh. What is she saying?

750
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:48,872
Lady. If your daughter's Park Do Ra,

751
00:48:48,896 --> 00:48:51,626
my daughter's Angelina Jolie.

752
00:48:52,126 --> 00:48:55,142
Forget about Jolie.
Is that story true?

753
00:48:55,166 --> 00:48:57,806
- It's the police!
- What? The police?

754
00:48:57,806 --> 00:49:00,007
- Run!
- Let's go!

755
00:49:00,007 --> 00:49:02,177
- Get them all!
- Darn it.

756
00:49:02,177 --> 00:49:04,083
- Take everything.
- Okay.

757
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:06,822
- You're coming with us.
- Oh, no.

758
00:49:06,846 --> 00:49:08,546
Lady!

759
00:49:09,547 --> 00:49:12,016
I didn't gamble.

760
00:49:12,016 --> 00:49:13,456
I just made coffee and noodles.

761
00:49:13,456 --> 00:49:15,257
Let go of me.
I must go to my daughter.

762
00:49:15,257 --> 00:49:18,362
No. I must see my daughter.

763
00:49:18,386 --> 00:49:21,561
(Reception)

764
00:49:37,447 --> 00:49:38,776
Do Sik.

765
00:49:39,246 --> 00:49:41,146
What about our poor sister?

766
00:49:45,387 --> 00:49:46,716
Do Jun.

767
00:49:48,157 --> 00:49:50,756
We'll do what we can
to help her walk again.

768
00:49:51,587 --> 00:49:55,227
That means not crying around her.
Do you get what I mean?

769
00:49:56,467 --> 00:49:57,796
Yes.

770
00:50:00,697 --> 00:50:03,006
Take good care of Grandma.

771
00:50:03,407 --> 00:50:04,836
You should go.

772
00:50:05,007 --> 00:50:06,336
Okay.

773
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:08,977
See you.

774
00:50:24,657 --> 00:50:25,986
Hello?

775
00:50:27,297 --> 00:50:29,557
Yes, I'm Ms. Baek Mi Ja's son.
What...

776
00:50:33,067 --> 00:50:34,367
What did you say?

777
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:38,437
Do Sik.

778
00:50:38,837 --> 00:50:41,337
Is it true that Do Ra can't walk?

779
00:50:41,337 --> 00:50:44,107
My gosh. My poor Do Ra.

780
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:46,847
That's rich coming from you
when you're behind bars.

781
00:50:47,947 --> 00:50:49,947
Do Sik, please get me out of here.

782
00:50:49,947 --> 00:50:51,447
I need to get out.

783
00:50:51,447 --> 00:50:53,357
How else can I nurse her...

784
00:50:53,357 --> 00:50:54,956
and make her porridge?

785
00:50:54,956 --> 00:50:57,957
Do Sik, come on. Get me out of here.

786
00:50:58,987 --> 00:51:00,396
As if you have that right.

787
00:51:01,596 --> 00:51:02,997
This is your fault.

788
00:51:04,067 --> 00:51:07,336
If you hadn't pushed Do Ra
in Gong Jin Dan's way,

789
00:51:07,367 --> 00:51:08,436
Do Ra wouldn't have gotten hurt.

790
00:51:08,436 --> 00:51:10,407
None of this would've happened!

791
00:51:11,467 --> 00:51:13,176
Do you get it, Ms. Baek?

792
00:51:13,277 --> 00:51:14,806
Do Sik!

793
00:51:14,806 --> 00:51:16,477
I already told you this!

794
00:51:17,447 --> 00:51:19,646
Park Do Ra, Park Do Jun,
and Park Do Sik...

795
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:22,517
don't have a mother
like you anymore.

796
00:51:22,786 --> 00:51:24,316
We're strangers now,

797
00:51:24,817 --> 00:51:26,117
so, please...

798
00:51:26,617 --> 00:51:29,256
stay away from us
and don't call us again.

799
00:51:32,286 --> 00:51:34,057
Do Sik, you!

800
00:51:34,226 --> 00:51:37,496
What has gotten into you, Do Sik?

801
00:51:37,496 --> 00:51:40,537
Get me out of here.

802
00:51:40,737 --> 00:51:42,806
I must get out of here.

803
00:51:42,806 --> 00:51:45,512
How else can I take care of Do Ra?

804
00:51:45,536 --> 00:51:47,476
Do Sik, don't go!

805
00:51:47,476 --> 00:51:51,146
Get me out of here.

806
00:51:51,146 --> 00:51:52,583
Do Sik...

807
00:51:52,607 --> 00:51:54,077
Do Sik!

808
00:52:11,527 --> 00:52:14,912
You liked my proposal?

809
00:52:14,936 --> 00:52:18,407
That's right.
After reading your proposal,

810
00:52:18,567 --> 00:52:20,476
my eyes opened wide...

811
00:52:20,476 --> 00:52:22,637
like a blind man
who got his vision back.

812
00:52:23,576 --> 00:52:24,977
Really?

813
00:52:26,047 --> 00:52:28,052
If you don't mind me asking,

814
00:52:28,076 --> 00:52:30,847
what did you like about my proposal?

815
00:52:31,387 --> 00:52:33,686
A genius doctor
traveling back in time...

816
00:52:33,686 --> 00:52:35,463
to when Manchu invaded Korea.

817
00:52:35,487 --> 00:52:38,057
The plot itself had me hooked.

818
00:52:38,857 --> 00:52:41,526
I have high hopes for this one.

819
00:52:44,596 --> 00:52:46,567
It still has a lot of work
to be done,

820
00:52:46,567 --> 00:52:48,896
so I appreciate
you taking interest in it.

821
00:52:48,896 --> 00:52:51,506
I'll work hard on the project.

822
00:52:52,467 --> 00:52:53,836
Anyway,

823
00:52:54,376 --> 00:52:56,546
how about we work together
on this one?

824
00:52:57,777 --> 00:52:59,106
Sorry?

825
00:52:59,646 --> 00:53:01,146
I have a feeling
I'll live in regret...

826
00:53:01,146 --> 00:53:02,977
if I pass up on this opportunity.

827
00:53:03,516 --> 00:53:06,287
Ms. Ko, work with me
on this project.

828
00:53:07,186 --> 00:53:08,987
Do you mean that?

829
00:53:08,987 --> 00:53:10,626
Of course.

830
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:13,257
Turn down offers
from other directors...

831
00:53:13,257 --> 00:53:14,697
and work with me, okay?

832
00:53:14,697 --> 00:53:16,797
I call dibs on this one.

833
00:53:16,797 --> 00:53:18,167
Got it?

834
00:53:19,766 --> 00:53:22,736
Thank you so much, Director!

835
00:53:26,436 --> 00:53:29,822
Sorry about that.
I was truly grateful, that's all.

836
00:53:29,846 --> 00:53:30,846
Thank you.

837
00:53:30,846 --> 00:53:32,646
No, it's all right.

838
00:53:32,746 --> 00:53:34,917
It's not like
anyone has claims on my hand.

839
00:53:36,016 --> 00:53:37,316
Sorry?

840
00:53:46,996 --> 00:53:48,556
Have I lost my mind?

841
00:53:48,556 --> 00:53:50,497
Why did I take his hand?

842
00:53:53,137 --> 00:53:54,437
Hold on.

843
00:53:54,797 --> 00:53:55,797
What did he mean...

844
00:53:55,797 --> 00:53:57,506
by no one having a claim
on his hand?

845
00:53:58,567 --> 00:54:01,577
Was that his way of telling me
that he's single?

846
00:54:01,907 --> 00:54:03,307
Unbelievable.

847
00:54:04,246 --> 00:54:06,622
Ko Myung Dong,
get a grip on yourself.

848
00:54:06,646 --> 00:54:08,016
Where is your head at?

849
00:54:08,016 --> 00:54:09,776
That's not what is important.

850
00:54:10,047 --> 00:54:11,687
I'm finally writing...

851
00:54:11,786 --> 00:54:15,486
my first miniseries!

852
00:54:16,527 --> 00:54:20,157
Am I dreaming or what?

853
00:54:41,177 --> 00:54:42,517
Do Ra.

854
00:54:43,217 --> 00:54:46,687
I got you your favorite flowers
and cake.

855
00:54:48,887 --> 00:54:50,327
Here you go.

856
00:54:53,496 --> 00:54:56,526
Would you like some warm tea
or some coffee?

857
00:54:59,596 --> 00:55:03,066
Do Ra, let's have some cake
and go for a walk.

858
00:55:03,536 --> 00:55:06,637
We'll then get you
to physical therapy.

859
00:55:08,837 --> 00:55:09,846
Pil Seung.

860
00:55:09,846 --> 00:55:11,176
Do Ra.

861
00:55:11,407 --> 00:55:13,617
I looked up people
in your condition.

862
00:55:14,746 --> 00:55:16,617
Many were able to walk again.

863
00:55:16,916 --> 00:55:18,817
I'm not talking about a miracle.

864
00:55:18,817 --> 00:55:21,117
They were able to walk again
after physical therapy.

865
00:55:21,657 --> 00:55:23,302
So let's see to it...

866
00:55:23,326 --> 00:55:26,026
that you work hard
on physical therapy yourself.

867
00:55:27,527 --> 00:55:29,657
I have something to say to you.

868
00:55:30,027 --> 00:55:32,267
Go ahead. I'm all ears.

869
00:55:32,967 --> 00:55:35,097
Don't come back here again.

870
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:39,267
What?

871
00:55:40,306 --> 00:55:41,907
I don't want you anymore,

872
00:55:44,306 --> 00:55:46,477
and I don't want to see you again.

873
00:55:48,317 --> 00:55:50,617
So, don't come back here.

874
00:55:52,387 --> 00:55:53,957
Do Ra, I...

875
00:55:55,317 --> 00:55:57,187
How could I live without seeing you?

876
00:55:58,286 --> 00:56:00,126
That isn't possible,

877
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:02,626
so your request is denied.

878
00:56:03,067 --> 00:56:04,667
You're being ridiculous.

879
00:56:05,326 --> 00:56:08,097
Does this seem like a joke to you?

880
00:56:12,337 --> 00:56:13,707
Do Ra.

881
00:56:15,237 --> 00:56:16,646
I know you're in pain.

882
00:56:17,746 --> 00:56:19,477
Still, you shouldn't say that.

883
00:56:20,876 --> 00:56:22,247
Pil Seung.

884
00:56:24,717 --> 00:56:27,086
Put yourself in my shoes.

885
00:56:29,257 --> 00:56:30,587
If you were in my situation,

886
00:56:30,587 --> 00:56:32,727
would you want to see me?

887
00:56:33,927 --> 00:56:36,867
Would you want me to see you
when you can't walk?

888
00:56:37,567 --> 00:56:39,926
It's rough as it is,

889
00:56:40,637 --> 00:56:42,997
and you being this way
only makes it worse.

890
00:56:44,007 --> 00:56:45,937
The agony is driving me crazy.

891
00:56:47,306 --> 00:56:50,347
Do Ra, don't be like this.

892
00:56:51,576 --> 00:56:54,517
I don't care
what condition you're in.

893
00:56:54,777 --> 00:56:56,146
It doesn't faze me at all.

894
00:56:56,746 --> 00:57:00,216
But you need to walk again,

895
00:57:00,617 --> 00:57:02,457
which is why I'm saying
we should try.

896
00:57:04,826 --> 00:57:06,457
That being said, Do Ra,

897
00:57:07,896 --> 00:57:09,396
don't be like this.

898
00:57:10,697 --> 00:57:11,903
No.

899
00:57:11,927 --> 00:57:14,936
I said no!

900
00:57:14,936 --> 00:57:16,837
Just get lost!

901
00:57:16,837 --> 00:57:18,637
Get lost!

902
00:57:18,637 --> 00:57:20,306
Do Ra, what's wrong?

903
00:57:20,306 --> 00:57:22,176
Pil Seung, just go.

904
00:57:23,246 --> 00:57:24,646
Go.

905
00:57:27,117 --> 00:57:28,646
Do Ra, what is it?

906
00:57:28,717 --> 00:57:31,517
Do Sik, get Pil Seung out of here.

907
00:57:33,817 --> 00:57:35,817
I don't want to look at him,

908
00:57:35,817 --> 00:57:38,227
so tell him to leave.

909
00:57:40,226 --> 00:57:42,856
Get Pil Seung out of here.

910
00:57:44,266 --> 00:57:46,966
Tell him to leave!

911
00:57:48,637 --> 00:57:50,966
Please tell him to leave.

912
00:58:43,326 --> 00:58:44,887
(Jung, who was responsible
for framing Park Do Ra...)

913
00:58:44,887 --> 00:58:46,427
(for having a sponsor,
was arrested.)

914
00:58:46,427 --> 00:58:48,596
(Former CEO
of Angel Investment Corp...)

915
00:58:48,596 --> 00:58:50,797
(who is on the run
solicited the set-up.)

916
00:58:50,797 --> 00:58:52,867
(Life crushed by a stalker)

917
00:58:52,867 --> 00:58:54,896
(Will the Park Do Ra Act
be established?)

918
00:58:54,896 --> 00:58:59,536
(Are we not to blame
for indulging in the witch hunt?)

919
00:58:59,595 --> 00:59:01,295
Apologize to Park Do Ra.

920
00:59:01,295 --> 00:59:03,204
- Apologize!
- Apologize!

921
00:59:03,204 --> 00:59:04,834
Give Park Do Ra her life back.

922
00:59:04,834 --> 00:59:06,534
- Get her life back!
- Get her life back!

923
00:59:06,534 --> 00:59:08,204
Apologize to Park Do Ra.

924
00:59:08,204 --> 00:59:10,045
- Apologize!
- Apologize!

925
00:59:10,045 --> 00:59:11,675
Give Park Do Ra her life back.

926
00:59:11,675 --> 00:59:13,514
- Get her life back!
- Get her life back!

927
00:59:13,514 --> 00:59:15,144
Apologize to Park Do Ra.

928
00:59:15,144 --> 00:59:16,945
- Apologize!
- Apologize!

929
00:59:16,945 --> 00:59:18,644
- Give Park Do Ra her life back.
- Sir, it's dangerous for you here.

930
00:59:18,644 --> 00:59:20,414
- Get her life back!
- Let us go that way.

931
00:59:20,414 --> 00:59:22,014
Apologize to Park Do Ra.

932
00:59:22,014 --> 00:59:23,854
- Apologize!
- Apologize!

933
00:59:23,854 --> 00:59:25,425
Give Park Do Ra her life back.

00:59:27,195 --> 00:59:28,724
Apologize to Park Do Ra.

(The truth behind the sponsor rumor
is revealed!)

937
00:59:30,295 --> 00:59:31,865
(Gong Jin Dan was behind it all.)

938
01:00:03,425 --> 01:00:05,464
- Do Ra.
- I'm going to kill him.

939
01:00:05,664 --> 01:00:08,365
Do Ra, what's wrong? What is it?

940
01:00:09,565 --> 01:00:11,265
I'll kill him.

941
01:00:11,334 --> 01:00:13,751
I'll kill Gong Jin Dan.

942
01:00:13,775 --> 01:00:16,675
Not only did he almost kill me,
he took away my ability to walk.

943
01:00:16,675 --> 01:00:17,981
I'll kill him.

944
01:00:18,005 --> 01:00:20,651
- I'll kill him!
- Do Ra.

945
01:00:20,675 --> 01:00:23,515
- Do Ra. Calm down.
- I don't need you.

946
01:00:23,715 --> 01:00:25,285
Get lost!

947
01:00:25,414 --> 01:00:28,515
I don't need you either. Go away.

948
01:00:28,985 --> 01:00:30,330
Leave!

949
01:00:30,354 --> 01:00:33,125
Okay. I will...

950
01:00:33,825 --> 01:00:35,694
I will avenge you.

951
01:00:39,325 --> 01:00:40,895
I'll kill him for you.

952
01:00:41,834 --> 01:00:43,194
I'll do it.

953
01:00:43,704 --> 01:00:45,064
I will do it.

954
01:00:45,834 --> 01:00:47,375
I'll kill him.

955
01:00:50,974 --> 01:00:53,544
Pil Seung. No.

956
01:00:54,075 --> 01:00:56,115
No. Pil Seung!

957
01:00:56,215 --> 01:00:58,685
Pil Seung! Don't go!

958
01:00:58,985 --> 01:01:00,654
Pil Seung! No!

959
01:01:01,354 --> 01:01:02,685
Pil Seung!

960
01:01:07,825 --> 01:01:09,154
Pil Seung.

961
01:01:09,724 --> 01:01:12,165
Pil Seung!

962
01:01:12,994 --> 01:01:14,365
Pil Seung!

963
01:01:15,664 --> 01:01:17,265
Do Ra!

964
01:01:17,764 --> 01:01:19,640
- Do Ra. What's wrong?
- Do Sik.

965
01:01:19,664 --> 01:01:21,711
Stop Pil Seung.

966
01:01:21,735 --> 01:01:24,675
- Tell him not to avenge me.
- Hey.

967
01:01:24,675 --> 01:01:27,875
- Go and stop Pil Seung!
- What...

968
01:01:32,485 --> 01:01:33,814
Sir.

969
01:01:34,815 --> 01:01:36,455
I have a favor to ask.

970
01:01:37,354 --> 01:01:38,725
A favor?

971
01:01:39,255 --> 01:01:41,194
I'll do anything.

972
01:01:46,195 --> 01:01:47,771
My poor Jin Dan.

973
01:01:47,795 --> 01:01:49,734
My poor boy.

974
01:01:51,385 --> 01:01:53,086
(Chairman Gong)

975
01:01:55,304 --> 01:01:57,245
Hello, Chairman Gong.

976
01:01:57,675 --> 01:01:59,075
Why did you call?

977
01:02:00,045 --> 01:02:01,475
Come to your office now?

978
01:02:02,175 --> 01:02:04,345
Okay, I will.

979
01:02:07,485 --> 01:02:09,584
What does he want to say
that's important?

980
01:02:13,554 --> 01:02:15,194
What's this?

981
01:02:16,255 --> 01:02:17,625
Hong Ae Kyo.

982
01:02:18,465 --> 01:02:20,564
You read what your son did,
didn't you?

983
01:02:22,334 --> 01:02:24,140
Embezzling
from Angel Investment Corp.,

984
01:02:24,164 --> 01:02:26,981
creating a slush fund,
attempted murder of Park Do Ra,

985
01:02:27,005 --> 01:02:28,875
and then the fake sponsor scandal.

986
01:02:30,945 --> 01:02:32,421
People flocked over...

987
01:02:32,445 --> 01:02:35,645
to protest outside our building.

988
01:02:36,045 --> 01:02:37,685
How would the company look...

989
01:02:38,345 --> 01:02:40,415
if Jin Dan were to be arrested?

990
01:02:40,615 --> 01:02:42,915
And how would we look?

991
01:02:44,054 --> 01:02:47,294
Take this money and with Jin Dan,

992
01:02:48,295 --> 01:02:50,424
leave the country.

993
01:02:52,124 --> 01:02:54,134
Money?

994
01:02:54,434 --> 01:02:55,964
This is cash?

995
01:03:02,474 --> 01:03:06,305
Take it and leave
with Jin Dan immediately.

996
01:03:11,815 --> 01:03:13,214
Thank you.

997
01:03:14,014 --> 01:03:15,915
Thank you, Jin Taek.

998
01:03:16,684 --> 01:03:20,395
I won't forget what you did for me.

999
01:03:56,595 --> 01:03:57,924
Mom.

1000
01:03:58,825 --> 01:04:00,935
Jin Dan. Are you okay?

1001
01:04:01,195 --> 01:04:03,265
You look dreadful.

1002
01:04:06,704 --> 01:04:08,174
I'm okay.

1003
01:04:08,534 --> 01:04:09,975
Mom.

1004
01:04:10,144 --> 01:04:12,705
What do you mean
we have cash to leave with?

1005
01:04:13,405 --> 01:04:15,151
Where did you get so much money?

1006
01:04:15,175 --> 01:04:18,714
It's in here.
Your brother gave it to me.

1007
01:04:19,715 --> 01:04:22,390
Jin Taek gave you the money?

1008
01:04:22,414 --> 01:04:23,530
Yes.

1009
01:04:23,554 --> 01:04:24,584
He said...

1010
01:04:24,584 --> 01:04:27,071
APP Group and family would look bad
if you got caught.

1011
01:04:27,095 --> 01:04:29,625
So he wants us to leave the country.

1012
01:04:29,755 --> 01:04:32,895
He talked about
Park Do Ra's attempted murder.

1013
01:04:32,925 --> 01:04:35,435
Jin Dan.
You didn't do that, did you?

1014
01:04:35,865 --> 01:04:39,180
No way, Mom. Would I do that?
Are you crazy?

1015
01:04:39,204 --> 01:04:40,575
Gong Jin Dan!

1016
01:04:43,304 --> 01:04:44,604
Mom.

1017
01:04:45,374 --> 01:04:47,151
Did you bring him here?

1018
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:48,774
What do you mean?

1019
01:04:49,275 --> 01:04:50,714
Darn it.

1020
01:04:51,244 --> 01:04:53,784
Was this money bait?

1021
01:04:53,784 --> 01:04:55,354
What? Bait?

1022
01:04:55,914 --> 01:04:59,125
Mom, run!

1023
01:05:00,825 --> 01:05:02,194
Gong Jin Dan!

1024
01:05:07,812 --> 01:05:10,712
