1
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:09,610
Honey.

2
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,480
(Episode 40)

3
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,780
Actually,
the moment the accident happened,

4
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,980
do you know who came to my mind?

5
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,380
Who?

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,090
It wasn't...

7
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,620
even Auntie or Jin Dan.

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,790
Pil Seung came to my mind.

9
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,700
The person
who will be by Ma Ri's side.

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,930
Pil Seung is the only person.

11
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:42,270
Honey. What are you talking about?

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,410
Pil Seung is Ma Ri's brother.

13
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:50,710
And he's your son.

14
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,750
Your son is my son too.

15
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,590
Honey...

16
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,230
What are you thinking about?

17
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,430
Are you...

18
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,330
I'm thinking about it right now.

19
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:14,610
I'll think a little more
and then let you know.

20
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,680
I need to shower.

21
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,780
What's he thinking?

22
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,620
No, that's preposterous.

23
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,120
It can't happen.

24
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,160
What did you just say?

25
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,000
Are you saying
Ms. Kim has been dating you...

26
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,040
because she owed you money?

27
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,970
Don't you try to deny it.

28
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,750
I will not let this go.

29
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,680
I'll investigate...

30
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,520
where you siphoned the money from
to give to Ji Young.

31
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,490
You'll see what happens...

32
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,560
when you embezzle company funds.

33
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,860
Just you wait.

34
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:09,930
Sure.

35
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,030
Come at me all you want.

36
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,830
Report me right now.

37
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,200
- I'd love to find out.
- Hang on.

38
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,840
You really didn't give her the cash?

39
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,510
If not from you,

40
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,310
where would Ji Young get
this much money?

41
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,580
Are you saying...

42
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,180
Ji Young dated you
because she owed you money,

43
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,190
but she returned it...

44
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,620
and broke it off with you?

45
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,420
Is that it?

46
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,860
My gosh.

47
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,500
Do you both take me for
a fool and a pushover?

48
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,430
Hey.

49
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,140
Do you think
I'll fall for this mind trick?

50
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,910
I'll get to the bottom of this.

51
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:59,110
And you. Here's a warning.

52
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,450
Don't try to cause a rift
between me and Ji Young.

53
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,210
Do you get it?

54
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,620
Anyway,

55
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,850
you said this wasn't yours.

56
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,890
I'll keep it.

57
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,040
Hey.

58
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,800
You said you wanted to talk.

59
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,640
About what?

60
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,580
Grandma.

61
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,950
I took 300,000 dollars
from your account.

62
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,720
You told me to spend it as I wished,

63
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,250
but I'm letting you know
because I thought you should know.

64
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,990
I'm sorry I didn't tell you first.

65
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,860
Ji Young. Why would you apologize?

66
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,700
I told you the money was yours.

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,100
I'm sure you spent it wisely.

68
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,410
You don't have to report to me.

69
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,540
Grandma.

70
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,580
Don't you want to know
what I did with it?

71
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,150
What?

72
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,350
What did you do with it?

73
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,750
I am curious.

74
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,020
I gave it...

75
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,390
to Mr. Gong to pay off my debt.

76
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:24,130
Did you really date
that fool of a man...

77
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,560
because of the money?

78
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,400
I only thought about it,

79
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,640
but it turned out to be true.

80
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,200
Yes, Grandma.

81
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,510
Oh, dear.

82
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,810
I dated Mr. Gong because he paid off
what Ms. Baek owed a loan shark.

83
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:43,050
I thought it was just wrong,
so I paid him back.

84
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,520
Okay. You did the right thing.
Good for you.

85
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,360
Such a debt is best paid off sooner.

86
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:54,420
Or it'll shackle you down,

87
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,260
and you'll end up
being dragged around.

88
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,900
You shouldn't live your life
in such a disgusting or low manner.

89
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,170
You did well.

90
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,410
I feel so much better
hearing you say that.

91
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,440
Goodness...

92
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,980
Grandma.

93
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,080
I'll work really hard
and earn back the money I took.

94
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,420
Don't be silly.

95
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,260
You don't have to worry about that.

96
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,400
But then,
be sure to earn a lot of money.

97
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,900
Yes, Grandma.

98
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,200
I'll make lots and lots of money...

99
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,040
and give it all to you.

100
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,210
Will you? Yes, do that.

101
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:48,150
You sweet thing. My good baby girl.

102
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,680
Don't ever fall ill, Grandma.

103
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,420
I won't. Let's both stay healthy.

104
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,890
I love you so much.

105
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,390
(Ms. Kim Ji Young)

106
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,660
(CEO Ko Pil Seung)

107
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,270
(Ms. Kim Ji Young)

108
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,200
(Ms. Soon Jung)

109
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,940
Hello?

110
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,370
Director. Let's meet.

111
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,140
There's a reason we must.

112
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:23,980
Ma'am.

113
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,080
Is that true?

114
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,990
Mr. Gong paid off the money
Ms. Baek owed to some loan sharks?

115
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,490
Yes.

116
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,860
For lending that wicked witch...

117
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,900
the money she needed,

118
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,830
he requested a relationship
with Ji Young.

119
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:46,440
That's why my sweet Ji Young...

120
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:50,210
was forced to date that fool.

121
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,810
It pains me so much
to think about that.

122
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,050
Goodness...

123
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:00,680
Director.
Ji Young doesn't care for him.

124
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,460
She never smiled
while she was with him.

125
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,890
Director.

126
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:12,130
You know why I'm telling you this,

127
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:14,660
don't you?

128
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,370
Pardon?

129
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:18,870
Oh, yes.

130
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,140
Ms. Lee. Thank you for telling me.

131
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,680
It must've been hard on Ji Young.

132
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,610
I'm glad.

133
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,280
Why does it seem to me...

134
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,660
that you're not very pleased
or happy?

135
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,230
No, I'm pleased.

136
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,960
Of course, I'm happy.

137
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,970
Grandma.

138
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,670
Shall we make spicy cold noodles
with young radish kimchi?

139
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,850
Are you still asleep?

140
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,820
Grandma, if you take a nap,

141
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,990
you can't sleep at...

142
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,890
Hey. Where did she go?

143
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,970
Grandma.

144
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,230
Grandma.

145
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,940
What happened?

146
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,010
She was napping earlier.

147
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,880
Grandma. Where are you?

148
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,290
What? You're outside?

149
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,390
I bet she'll run out in a hurry.

150
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,030
Goodness.

151
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:58,900
Director. What are you doing here?

152
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,570
Grandma. What's going on?

153
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,440
I thought
you were sleeping in the room.

154
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,250
I asked the director
to buy me an Americano.

155
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,620
Then you should've told me
before you left.

156
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:20,160
I got so scared
thinking you'd gotten lost.

157
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,030
If you couldn't find me,
you could've called me.

158
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,360
Why worry when you hung this
around my neck like a leash?

159
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,500
Ji Young.
Here's a housewarming gift.

160
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,240
I hope everything works out
while you live here.

161
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,340
Thank you.

162
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,610
Ji Young.

163
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,910
Will you leave him standing
in the street?

164
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,720
Director. Why don't you come in...

165
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,790
and have a bowl of soybean noodles?

166
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,260
You bought me an Americano.

167
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,600
I should treat you in return.

168
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,670
Thank you for the offer,
but I must refuse today.

169
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,640
I'll visit another time if possible.

170
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,010
That's too bad.

171
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,680
Go on inside. I'll leave.

172
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:16,480
Okay, then, Director. Bye.

173
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,050
Goodbye.

174
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,520
Grandma, did you tell
Director Ko everything?

175
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,420
Why did you tell him all that?

176
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,720
What's wrong with telling him?

177
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,530
Otherwise,
Director Ko would think...

178
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,330
you were just a mean girl
who cheated on him and dumped him.

179
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,770
He deserves to know...

180
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:12,700
that you didn't hate him
and that you had your reasons.

181
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,310
You're driving me crazy, Grandma.

182
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,910
By the way, Ji Young, I think...

183
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,640
Director Ko has changed.

184
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,910
What do you mean?

185
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,520
When he heard
that you paid the money back...

186
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,450
and finally ended things
with that jerk,

187
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,860
I thought he'd be thrilled.

188
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,320
But he only seemed...

189
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,960
a little happy, you know.

190
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,200
I'm sure...

191
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,600
his feelings were deeply hurt
because of you.

192
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,470
So...

193
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,370
you shouldn't have told him
in the first place.

194
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,040
I have nothing to do with him now.

195
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,380
You have feelings for him,

196
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,910
but you chose to date that jerk
because of money.

197
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:57,980
I'm your grandmother.

198
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,250
How could I keep quiet
knowing all that?

199
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,290
I had to sort things out.

200
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,620
Ji Young.

201
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,760
It's not too late.

202
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,060
You should start being nice
to Director Ko, okay?

203
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,500
It's not like Director Ko...

204
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,600
has no feelings for you at all.

205
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
He's just a little upset. Okay?

206
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:24,610
So before someone gets in your way
and takes him away from you,

207
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,310
you have to hurry and get him...

208
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,510
by doing something to soothe him.

209
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,120
No, Grandma.

210
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,590
I don't deserve to have feelings
for Director Ko.

211
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,920
Gosh.

212
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,290
Oh, dear.

213
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,360
All right.

214
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:47,030
I have to agree...

215
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,600
that you did wrong.

216
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,500
I understand
that it was because of money,

217
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,210
but you went to someone else.

218
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,980
But Ji Young,

219
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,720
you should reflect on yourself
and try to do better.

220
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,020
Then Director Ko might feel better.

221
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,320
Grandma.

222
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,160
I have no right...

223
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,430
to put Director Ko through that.

224
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,200
He deserves someone better than me.

225
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,470
So, Grandma, let's not talk
about this ever again.

226
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,170
Wait, Ji Young.

227
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,340
Oh, dear.

228
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,880
That poor thing.

229
00:13:55,330 --> 00:14:00,000
For lending that wicked witch...

230
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,070
the money she needed,

231
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:05,240
he requested a relationship
with Ji Young.

232
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:09,010
That's why my sweet Ji Young...

233
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:12,380
was forced to date that fool.

234
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,560
I had no idea.

235
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:58,030
What's with that guy?

236
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,030
Hey, you.

237
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,900
Come on out.

238
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,870
Come here.

239
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,110
Hey, mister. Come here.

240
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,210
What?

241
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,050
You're that guy from the other day.

242
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,950
Jin Dan.

243
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:26,520
Seriously, what are you up to?

244
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,360
What were you doing here?

245
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,330
What brought you here?

246
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,930
I was just in the neighborhood
looking for something.

247
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,630
Was it here or there?
It's confusing.

248
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,200
But why did you hide yourself
when you saw me?

249
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,600
I didn't hide.

250
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,440
I was about to go this way.

251
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,040
But you called me, so I came.

252
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,510
I'm sorry if you got the wrong idea.

253
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,420
If you don't want me
to get the wrong idea,

254
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,350
don't ever come here again.

255
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,420
If you show up here again,
I won't let it slide.

256
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,030
I'll call the police.

257
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,260
There are surveillance cameras
installed everywhere.

258
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,630
Do you understand?

259
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:08,970
Aren't you going to answer me?

260
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,570
Sure. I understand.

261
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,340
Darn it. It's only morning,

262
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,300
and you're already
getting on my nerves.

263
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,280
Go away!

264
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,460
Are you not leaving?

265
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,290
Darn it.

266
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,270
Mom. The insurance guy
from the other day.

267
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,940
Why is he sneaking around our place?

268
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,170
What? Who?

269
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,810
What's the deal between you two?

270
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,150
What are you talking about?
There's nothing going on between us.

271
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:00,780
Then why was he lurking
outside our house and staring at me?

272
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,750
Are you sure there's nothing?

273
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,190
Of course.

274
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,460
Mom, you stop seeing him.

275
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,020
Don't take out insurance
through him.

276
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,190
It's really getting on my nerves.

277
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,760
Okay?

278
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,060
Okay. Fine.

279
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,300
But he's an insurance guy,

280
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,670
so he wanders around a lot.

281
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,970
I guess he was in the neighborhood
for work.

282
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,740
Don't worry about it.

283
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,670
Okay. Bye.

284
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,820
Sang Gu. Are you crazy?
Have you lost your mind?

285
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,650
Why were you lurking
around our house?

286
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,690
Do you want to ruin
my Jin Dan's life or what?

287
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:42,290
Why are you being like this?

288
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,330
Ae Kyo.

289
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,060
How did you spoil him like that?

290
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,470
I'm old enough to be his dad,
but he was rude and disrespectful.

291
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,930
It was really upsetting.

292
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,770
I'm his father, after all.

293
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,870
Someone might hear you.
Are you insane?

294
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,770
It's not like I'm a stranger.

295
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:04,610
I'm just upset that I was treated
like that by my own son.

296
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:07,520
Sang Gu,
Jin Dan is deeply frustrated now...

297
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,220
because the adoption
has been called off.

298
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,160
And he caught you
sneaking around our place.

299
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,920
How nice do you expect him to be?

300
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,990
The adoption is called off? Why?

301
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,260
I don't know.

302
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,530
You don't have to know that.

303
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:23,670
Anyway, make sure
not to come near him again.

304
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,700
With the adoption called off,

305
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,600
what if Chairman Gong finds out
you are his birth father?

306
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,310
We will be done for then.

307
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,810
Okay. I'll be careful
not to get caught.

308
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,650
Are you saying
you'll keep sneaking around Jin Dan?

309
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,680
How can I live
without seeing my own son?

310
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:41,620
Now that I know he's my son,

311
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,690
I can't stop thinking about him.
I want to see him...

312
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,020
- and hold him in my arms.
- What are you talking about?

313
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,630
You are out of your mind.

314
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,730
Sang Gu, pull yourself together.

315
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:00,370
I'm here to apologize
for what has happened.

316
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,820
Both families...

317
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,850
have been having a big difficulty.

318
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,430
I felt betrayed by my wife,

319
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:26,400
so I gave Pil Seung a hard time
when he had done nothing wrong.

320
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,800
And...

321
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:33,070
I even made
Mr. Ko and Sun Young suffer.

322
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,870
I was being petty.

323
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,780
When Mr. Ko and Sun Young
came to my office the other day,

324
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,780
I realized I did you...

325
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,820
a great wrong.

326
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,290
I sincerely apologize...

327
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,290
for what I did back then.

328
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,060
Gosh.

329
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,530
It's all right. You even...

330
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:02,770
made our Pil Seung
the CEO of GOGO Entertainment.

331
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:07,670
We are actually grateful...

332
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:11,610
that you recognized his ability.

333
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,540
You accepted...

334
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,550
my Ma Ri as Pil Seung's sister
and cared for her.

335
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,320
I don't know
how to thank you enough.

336
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,990
Gosh, it's no big deal.
Please don't say that.

337
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,590
Pil Seung cares a lot about Ma Ri.

338
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,200
We want to thank you
for accepting our Pil Seung...

339
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,070
as Ma Ri's older brother.

340
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,940
Ma Ri has an older brother now,

341
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,870
and the two get along really well.

342
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,010
You have no idea
how happy that makes me.

343
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:49,980
From now on,

344
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,650
I hope
our families can get along well...

345
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,450
like one big family.

346
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,620
We share a son, don't we?

347
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,960
Yes, of course.

348
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,630
We should get along
like one big family.

349
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,830
Ma Ri and I agreed to be friends,

350
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:16,740
but I think of her
as if she were my own granddaughter.

351
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,580
I appreciate that.

352
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:50,113
Gosh, what's happening?

353
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,361
The chairman of APP Group...

354
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,397
hopes for an amicable relationship
as if we were one big family.

355
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,200
He said we shared a son...

356
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,140
and thanked us
for raising Pil Seung well.

357
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:04,540
Now that’s a man
with boundless generosity.

358
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,910
One must be of that level
to run a company of that size.

359
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:11,550
He operates on a different scale
compared to us normal people.

360
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,420
Mom, take a breath
between your words.

361
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,480
You'll be gasping for air
at this rate.

362
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:20,720
Isn’t Chairman Gong
such a respectable man?

363
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,090
He forgave his wife...

364
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,660
and didn't divorce her
after what she did.

365
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,930
On top of that,
he acknowledged her son...

366
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,930
as Ma Ri's older brother.

367
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,660
I have a newfound respect for him.

368
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,200
He's no ordinary man.

369
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:36,940
I guess I appreciate...

370
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,970
how he came to see us in person.

371
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,810
Honey, I think...

372
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,580
he came by today
hoping that you and Soo Yeon...

373
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:48,920
could bury the hatchet
and be friends again.

374
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,790
He's right, Sun Young.

375
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:54,320
Maybe you should try to be
on better terms with Ma Ri's mom...

376
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,390
even if you can't be
best friends again.

377
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:00,730
Chairman Gong enjoys
the sikhye you make.

378
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,330
Make some as well as yakbap
and take them to her.

379
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:07,170
Okay, I'll think about it.

380
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:16,280
What was the important matter
you had me come to the office to hear?

381
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:19,580
Earlier today,

382
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,420
I was at Sun Young's house.

383
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:29,190
You were at Sun Young's house?

384
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,060
Why did you go there
without telling me?

385
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:36,700
I have to adopt Pil Seung.

386
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:39,930
Honey.

387
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,340
Why are you so startled?

388
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,740
I already told you...

389
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,940
that your son is as good as mine.

390
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,050
Did you say that
while over at Sun Young's?

391
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,780
Of course, I know better than that.

392
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,220
I only saw how the family was.

393
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:59,720
We must know
what they think about us...

394
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:03,530
to even bring up my adoption plans.

395
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,730
From what I saw,

396
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,900
they're not as angry
with you anymore.

397
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,940
They also think of Pil Seung
as Ma Ri's brother.

398
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:19,040
Honey, it still seems wrong.

399
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,680
I thought a lot about this too.

400
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,610
I'm not suggesting this for fun.

401
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,650
As you know,

402
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,490
I've always had
a soft spot for Pil Seung.

403
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:34,260
Ever since he was in high school,

404
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,130
I saw him as a reliable young man.

405
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,930
I was fond of him to the point...

406
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:45,070
that I wanted him
to be Ma Ri's husband...

407
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:48,070
not knowing
he was actually her brother.

408
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,040
Honey.

409
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:56,210
He is someone I want for our family.

410
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:00,750
There's no way of knowing
what Sun Young will say,

411
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:05,190
and I don't want to hurt her
more than I already have.

412
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,220
Honey.

413
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,890
This isn't something bad.

414
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,890
We're not taking him away from them.

415
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,600
The two families will become one.

416
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,430
It'll benefit both families.

417
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,640
Honey.

418
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,640
I'll handle every part
of the process,

419
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:27,140
so just promise me...

420
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:30,350
that you'll take my side
no matter what.

421
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,110
Only Pil Seung...

422
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,850
can protect Ma Ri.

423
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,690
All right. I'll do that.

424
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,540
(CEO Gong Jin Dan)

425
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,740
The number is unavailable.

426
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:05,880
Please leave a message
after the tone.

427
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,980
What on earth?

428
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,690
She isn't picking up...

429
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,520
and is ignoring my texts.

430
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,890
Could she...

431
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:18,830
have blocked my number?

432
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:23,460
Seriously.
Who does she think she is?

433
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:25,670
Darn.

434
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,200
Mr. Cho.

435
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,400
Get me Kim Ji Young's schedule.

436
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:33,040
I apologize for causing a scene
on the first day of filming.

437
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,380
I guess I was a bit nervous.

438
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,150
It will never happen again.

439
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:43,450
From here on out,
I'll only do my best.

440
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,390
Again, I'm sorry.

441
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:49,990
- It's all right.
- It's all right.

442
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,690
- It's all right.
- It's all right.

443
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,490
Let's think of what happened...

444
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:55,230
as all the bad luck
rolled into one...

445
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,200
and only move forward from here.

446
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:00,470
Let us create a masterpiece
that will shock the world!

447
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,970
Go, "Seoul Lady!"

448
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,810
- Go, team!
- Go, team!

449
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,840
Cheers, guys.

450
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,240
Please enjoy.

451
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,750
Go ahead and mingle with the staff.

452
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,380
You should join us here.

453
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,380
Ji Young, you look like
a completely different person.

454
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,780
How you're dressed,
your expressions,

455
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,790
and your way of speaking.

456
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:21,360
You're nothing like the Kim Ji Young
who starred in "The House of Roses."

457
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,090
- Let's do a good job.
- I agree.

458
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:25,330
You look exactly
like your character.

459
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,500
You're the definition
of a Seoul lady now.

460
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,660
Thanks for saying so.

461
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:32,400
Ji Young, I'm sure
it has been rough for you.

462
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,900
Please enjoy and tell me
if you need anything more.

463
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,470
Have this and stay strong.

464
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:39,670
Thanks.

465
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:43,240
This is great.

466
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:45,110
Isn't it good?

467
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,050
Yes, it's delicious.

468
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,420
It's already giving me energy.

469
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,920
The food is better here.

470
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:53,020
It's busy with many customers.

471
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,390
The weather's hot,

472
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,060
- so you'll have it rough.
- Hardly.

473
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,730
I loved how you filmed
our previous scene.

474
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,840
Wasn't it good?

475
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:11,770
Pil Seung, you have matured so much.

476
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:14,840
Back then, you were
the cute assistant director.

477
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:18,280
But you've become
an inspiring director.

478
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,120
Assistant Director,

479
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,860
I need to go home early
because of my grandmother.

480
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:32,660
Please be understanding
even if you don't see me later on.

481
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:36,300
Sure, I'll let the director
know that.

482
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,570
Ms. Kim.

483
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:48,380
You haven't been taking my calls
and have been ignoring my texts.

484
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,810
What are you playing at?

485
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:52,850
Did you think
returning the 300,000 dollars...

486
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:54,480
would end things?

487
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:58,450
Mr. Gong, I have nothing more
to say to you.

488
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:03,320
Am I a toy you can play with?

489
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,800
When you needed the money,
you stuck onto me like a leech.

490
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,630
But now that you have the money,
you kicked me to the curb.

491
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:13,230
Am I a ball you can kick around?

492
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,110
I believe I made myself clear.

493
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:20,310
I dated you because I thought
you had ended it with her.

494
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:23,580
If I had known
you had a woman to marry,

495
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,450
I wouldn't have gone out with you.

496
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:27,650
I told you I ended things with her.

497
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:28,920
For you of all people.

498
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,190
Ji Young, let's not do this.

499
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,120
It's over between us.

500
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,430
Why won't you accept that?

501
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,260
It's over?

502
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,030
Is it over if you say it is?

503
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:47,440
I'm not done with us.

504
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:50,470
That means it isn't over.

505
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,540
Let go of me.

506
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:53,410
Would you if you were in my shoes?

507
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:57,310
We'll go somewhere quiet
and reconsider our relationship.

508
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,850
Let go of me.

509
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,090
Let go of her.

510
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:08,420
Ji Young's refusing to go.

511
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,830
Who are you to butt in?

512
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:12,830
Why can't you just mind
your own business?

513
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,700
Director Ko, why are you also...

514
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,180
- Ji Young.
- Hey.

515
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,680
Do you think you can just leave
after throwing a punch at me?

516
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:47,700
Jin Dan, what happened to your face?

517
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,430
Did you get into a fight?

518
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,730
Gosh, as if.

519
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:55,270
It's not like
he's some immature kid.

520
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,000
He walked right into a glass door.

521
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,740
I do that sometimes as well.

522
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,440
Glass doors can be dangerous.

523
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,180
Even birds die
after crashing into them.

524
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,180
Chairman Gong,

525
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:06,080
what was so important that
you had us all gather to hear it?

526
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:08,980
Jin Dan's here too, so tell us.

527
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,460
It concerns the son I'll adopt.

528
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,760
What...

529
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,860
Are you giving it a second thought?

530
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,430
Right. What can you do?

531
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:25,200
I'm glad you reconsidered.

532
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,500
I won't be adopting Jin Dan
as my son,

533
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,610
but I still need someone
to protect the company and Ma Ri.

534
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,640
That's why I'll adopt someone else.

535
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,280
What are you talking about?

536
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,080
Who can you adopt...

537
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,350
when there isn't anyone else
within the Gong family?

538
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,820
Ma Ri's brother.

539
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,020
I'm thinking of adopting
Ko Pil Seung as my son.

540
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:48,920
If he and his family
are on board, of course.

541
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,220
What?

542
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,630
Jin Taek, what on earth
are you saying?

543
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,630
Did you just say Ko Pil Seung?

544
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:59,670
Chairman Gong,
are you in your right mind?

545
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:01,900
This adopted son...

546
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:05,340
will have all the rights
to the company and family assets.

547
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,440
How could it be someone...

548
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,240
from a different family
and not Jin Dan?

549
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,110
You're willing to give
everything you have...

550
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,610
to the son Soo Yeon had in secret?

551
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:16,080
He's not a complete stranger,
but Ma Ri's brother.

552
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,090
I came to the decision...

553
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:19,850
after thinking about it
from many perspectives.

554
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,290
This family is in shambles.

555
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:27,360
Do as you wish.

556
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:30,300
Just hand APP Group over to
the Ko family or the Choi family...

557
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,530
for all I care!

558
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,940
Goodness me.

559
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,500
My gosh.

560
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,240
My head.

561
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:39,570
- What is going on?
- Auntie.

562
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,550
What?

563
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,060
He'll adopt Ko Pil Seung?

564
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:00,260
What is this darn mess?

565
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,600
What are you looking at?

566
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:12,870
What are you looking at?

567
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,850
Gong Jin Taek!

568
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,550
Gong Jin Taek, get out here.

569
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:27,820
Gong Jin Taek!

570
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,590
Jin Dan,
what is the meaning of this?

571
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,030
If you're drunk,
go to your room and sleep it off.

572
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,670
Gong Jin Taek, you.

573
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,240
You're not Gong Dae Gil's only son.

574
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:44,110
I'm also his son.

575
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:47,980
You have no right
to belittle me like this.

576
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:51,680
Is it because my mom's a mistress?

577
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,180
How can you adopt Ko Pil Seung...

578
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:56,520
and not the one
who shares your last name?

579
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,190
Am I inferior to him?

580
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,090
I'm your brother, Jin Taek.

581
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:03,160
I'm your flesh and blood!

582
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:09,530
Gosh, why are you two
being this way?

583
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:13,100
Ever since I was a kid,

584
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,600
you’ve never even looked at me
with affection.

585
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,210
I looked up to you
and followed you around,

586
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:23,010
but you've been treating me
like I don't matter at all.

587
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,910
Gong Jin Taek, how dare you?

588
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:31,690
Our father, Chairman Gong Dae Gil,
is watching us from above.

589
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:34,560
Please don't. Stop this, Jin Dan.

590
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,990
Mom.

591
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,360
Why did you have to be his mistress?

592
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:41,530
Why?

593
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:45,470
Couldn't you have married someone
who had nothing to his name...

594
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:47,440
and had me instead?

595
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,800
I wouldn't have been this lonely...

596
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,510
even if I had been born
to a family not well off!

597
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:55,980
I'm sorry. Jin Dan, I'm so sorry.

598
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:59,380
So, please.
Let's go upstairs, Jin Dan.

599
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:05,090
I can't take it anymore.

600
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,990
- I'm too lonely.
- Chairman Gong.

601
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,630
It's wrong of you to do this.

602
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:14,730
I don't care how much Jin Dan lacks,

603
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,670
he's still your little brother.

604
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:28,310
Gosh.

605
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,740
Honey.

606
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:00,980
You need to reconsider.

607
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:05,780
It feels wrong to hurt others
just so that we can sleep better...

608
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,210
at night.

609
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,350
We're pushing...

610
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,720
too hard.

611
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,570
("Seoul Lady")

612
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:32,640
Ji Young.

613
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,740
We'll start filming
as soon as Kang Bin gets here,

614
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,010
so let's go over the lines.

615
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:38,450
Sure, Director.

616
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:46,790
Why do you keep following me?

617
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,290
It's not like
you own this road, Bun Hong.

618
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:53,960
I have every right to walk here.

619
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,330
I'm going my own way,

620
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:57,570
so don't mind me.

621
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:00,000
I know you were following me.

622
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,200
I wasn't.

623
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,510
Follow me again,
and I'll snap your neck in half.

624
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,460
Director.

625
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,830
- I can't believe you laughed!
- I'm sorry.

626
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,160
It was adorable,
and I couldn't help it.

627
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:31,430
But you're the one
who laughed first.

628
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:34,130
When did I laugh first?

629
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:39,310
Anyway...

630
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,910
I'll go and get ready for filming.

631
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:44,250
My gosh!

632
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,850
I saved you from falling.

633
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:55,720
If it hadn't been for me,
you would've cracked your skull.

634
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,390
Ji Young.

635
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,960
You need me, don't you?

636
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,640
Whatever.

637
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,120
Do Ra, get a grip on yourself.

638
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,420
You can't do this.

639
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:34,030
Don't smile at Pil Seung again.

640
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,600
Don't let him be the reason
your heart skips a beat.

641
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:55,150
Mom.

642
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,490
Why did you have to be his mistress?

643
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:00,690
Why?

644
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:04,460
Couldn't you have married someone
who had nothing to his name...

645
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:06,460
and had me instead?

646
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,030
I wouldn't have been this lonely...

647
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:10,430
even if I had been born
to a family not well off!

648
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:15,270
How could they?

649
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,170
How could they do this
to my Jin Dan?

650
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,920
Hi, Sang Gu. It's me.

651
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,850
Are you crying, Ae Kyo? Why?

652
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:34,350
What's wrong? What happened?

653
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:35,390
Sang Gu.

654
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,560
What should we do about our Jin Dan?

655
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:43,460
What? Is that true?

656
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,500
So what? Did Jin Dan cry too?

657
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:50,000
To be honest, Jin Dan and I...

658
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:53,410
used to walk on eggshells
in that house.

659
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,640
Until Jin Dan
graduated from high school,

660
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,650
we lived in the annex
and weren’t even allowed...

661
00:39:58,710 --> 00:39:59,980
in the main house.

662
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:03,350
Jin Dan wasn't even
on the family register then.

663
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:07,120
He went by the name Hong Jin Dan
because he took my family name.

664
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,490
What? He was Hong Jin Dan?

665
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:10,720
Yes.

666
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,890
Shortly before
Chairman Gong Dae Gil died,

667
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:17,130
he registered Jin Dan as his son,
and he got a new family name.

668
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,630
Angel Investment Corp.,
the company Jin Dan is CEO of.

669
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:24,540
The late chairman...

670
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:27,010
left that subsidiary to Jin Dan
in his will.

671
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,210
He was only recently allowed
to take over.

672
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:36,680
You can't even imagine
the humiliation and abuse...

673
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,220
we went through.

674
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:41,250
We're not living in the Joseon era.

675
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:43,890
The adoption too.

676
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:45,760
It wasn't our request.

677
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:48,230
They made a huge fuss
of suggesting it.

678
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,160
Just because
his arranged marriage fell through,

679
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:53,570
they called off the adoption too.

680
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:55,800
They treat Jin Dan
like he betrayed his country.

681
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,470
And now what?

682
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:00,540
Jin Taek wants to adopt the son...

683
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,080
his wife kept hidden.

684
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:04,710
He's not even a Gong.
He's just Ma Ri's half-brother.

685
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:07,150
Do you see how much
Jin Dan must be hurting?

686
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,880
He's crying inside and out.

687
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:13,350
What's wrong with these people?
They're cruel and plain nasty.

688
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:16,290
I blame Ma Ri.

689
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:18,990
To be honest, she's a half-wit.

690
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,430
Everyone knows
she can't function as an adult.

691
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,730
Anyone would say
Jin Dan should inherit APP Group.

692
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:28,430
But just because
she's Jin Taek's daughter,

693
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,970
she's allowed
to get in Jin Dan's way.

694
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:34,370
Now she's being used
as an excuse to bring in...

695
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:36,810
her half-brother
and cast Jin Dan aside.

696
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:40,480
Ae Kyo.

697
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:42,720
Because of that half-witted girl,

698
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,590
our Jin Dan is always pushed aside?

699
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:47,820
Just because he was a mistress' son,

700
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,760
he was never acknowledged
or accepted.

701
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,290
I feel so sorry for the boy.

702
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:57,300
My heart breaks.

703
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:00,230
Yes.

704
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,770
If not for her, our Jin Dan...

705
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,370
would be the only Gong heir.

706
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:08,370
That darn APP Group.

707
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,710
If not for that girl,

708
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,450
the whole thing could go to Jin Dan.

709
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:21,520
What's all this, Ms. Baek?

710
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,890
Ji Young.
I decided to live here with you.

711
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,290
Will you take me in?

712
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:30,630
- Ms. Baek.
- Yes, like you said,

713
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:33,400
your memories haven't returned,
so you feel awkward around me...

714
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,900
because I don't feel like your mom.

715
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:38,100
Isn't that even more reason
for us to live together?

716
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,840
Isn't that why
you set aside a room for Do Jun?

717
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,540
So he could visit often
and get closer.

718
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,880
So, Ji Young,
will you please let me live here?

719
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,750
I'll be real good to you.

720
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,780
The old hag... No.

721
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:54,050
Your grandmother.
I'll treat her well too.

722
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:55,560
And when you're out working,

723
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:59,490
I'll stay close to your grandma
and look after her, Ji Young.

724
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,360
Ji Young.

725
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,960
What's wrong with you, Mom?

726
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:08,000
This is just temporary.

727
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,700
She won't cut ties with us forever.
Come home with me.

728
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:12,910
Will you put that down?

729
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:14,440
Ji Young.

730
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:16,440
You said your dad told you...

731
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,140
to look after Mom and your brothers.

732
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,280
You said you remembered that,

733
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,520
so how could you do this
to your own mom?

734
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:26,020
I can't leave. I won't leave.

735
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,750
What's this ruckus?

736
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:31,290
What is this thing doing here,
causing a nuisance?

737
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:33,230
You evil witch.
Get out this instant.

738
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:34,760
Get up and leave!

739
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,700
- You darn old woman!
- Go away.

740
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,770
- Fine! I'll leave!
- You...

741
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:41,670
- I'm leaving. Don't hit me!
- Leave now!

742
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:43,070
I'm going!

743
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:46,010
- Okay, I'm going!
- There's nothing for you here.

744
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:48,710
Get out of here. Get out.

745
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:56,280
Even if she doesn't remember me,

746
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,380
how could she treat me like this?

747
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:00,790
Do Sik.

748
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,460
I don't want to live anymore.

749
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:07,160
My own daughter doesn't respect me.

750
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,960
What's the point
of living like this?

751
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,220
Ji Young.

752
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:33,290
Do Sik.

753
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:39,830
Mom wronged you so many times
and in so many ways.

754
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:41,990
I know she gave you a hard time too.

755
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:43,530
How could I not?

756
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,530
But she's still our mom.

757
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,870
Do Sik.

758
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:55,240
She cried so much after you died.

759
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,740
She regretted
not treating you better.

760
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:02,280
But you know,
I feel sorry for her too.

761
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,450
Do you think it was easy...

762
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:07,650
for a widow to raise
three kids on her own?

763
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:10,690
So, Ji Young.

764
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:18,900
- Do Sik.
- Will you please...

765
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:21,770
forgive Mom one more time?
I'll beg on my knees for her.

766
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:24,640
Forgive her just this once.
Please, Ji Young.

767
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,040
Do Sik. Get on your feet.

768
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:29,510
- Stand up. Don't do this.
- Ji Young.

769
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,110
- Do Sik. Get up.
- You're home, Geum Dong?

770
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:35,780
Yes. I'm home.

771
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:41,320
You left to look for
your older sister Dong Dong.

772
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,860
Why are you back on your own?

773
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:44,560
Dong Dong?

774
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:47,590
Yes, your older sister Dong Dong.

775
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:49,830
You haven't found her yet?

776
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:51,830
Grandma.

777
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:54,630
Oh, dear.

778
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Oh, poor Dong Dong.

779
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:05,110
Do Jun.
You're strong enough to protect me.

780
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,850
Why do you say
you don't have the power to?

781
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:10,350
What do you mean?

782
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:12,550
Don't you remember?

783
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:15,250
You helped me when we first met.

784
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:17,360
And last time, when a stranger...

785
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:20,130
asked for my number,
you chased him away.

786
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:23,530
And each time my legs gave way,
you picked me up and carried me.

787
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:30,700
Are you beating around the bush
because you feel bad...

788
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:32,510
about rejecting me?

789
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:34,970
It's not like that.

790
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:40,480
Then say if you'd like it
if we were to date or not.

791
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,320
- I'd like that.
- Then what's the problem?

792
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:48,960
I told you. I lack a lot.

793
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:54,590
Do Jun.

794
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:57,760
To be frank, I'm even more lacking.

795
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:02,470
I hurt my head in an accident,

796
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:05,070
so I act like a fool
a lot of the time.

797
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:11,410
Is that why you're not confident
you can stick around me?

798
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:17,020
Ma Ri.

799
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:21,350
If only I could,

800
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:24,020
I want to be with you forever.

801
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:28,260
Do Jun. Do you mean that?

802
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,730
Yes. I do.

803
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,770
Then...

804
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,540
stay by my side forever.

805
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:43,910
Can you do that?

806
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:50,950
Okay. I'll do that.

807
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:55,150
Then...

808
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,920
is this our first day as a couple?

809
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:07,100
Yes.

810
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:11,400
Do Jun. I've always wanted to say...

811
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,170
"this is our first day as a couple"
because it's what...

812
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:16,780
couples say in dramas.

813
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,310
Do Jun. Thank you
for making my dream come true.

814
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,840
Myung Dong, were you thirsty?

815
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:49,340
You look pretty whatever you do.

816
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:51,180
Do Sik.

817
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,950
How much longer do we have to date
in secret like this?

818
00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:00,150
Let's stop being like this
and tell everyone.

819
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:02,420
Tell everyone?

820
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:04,720
Think about it.

821
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:06,860
What matters is
that we like each other.

822
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,230
We don't need
our families' permission.

823
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:11,400
I'll handle my family,

824
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,500
and you handle yours.

825
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:14,970
Can you do that?

826
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:18,340
Of course. That's what I can do.

827
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:22,640
These days,

828
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,940
I'm not even sure...

829
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:27,450
if I really have a boyfriend or not.

830
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:29,680
Why would you say that, Myung Dong?

831
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,520
I, your boyfriend, am
sitting right in front of you.

832
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,850
You're not alone.

833
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,860
What's the point
of having a boyfriend...

834
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:38,490
if I can't even tell anyone
about him?

835
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:43,060
I'm sorry.

836
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,970
As you know, things are
complicated for my family now.

837
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:49,700
Can you wait a little more?

838
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:51,240
For how long?

839
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,270
When will things stop
being so complicated for you?

840
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:54,670
When I'm 50?

841
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:57,510
You're unbelievable, Do Sik.

842
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:00,180
Wait, Myung Dong...

843
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:24,170
Ji Young.

844
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:27,440
We need to talk.

845
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,280
About what?

846
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:36,180
I said I had nothing to say to you.

847
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:39,150
Ji Young.

848
00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:43,520
It's over for us.
We have no reason to see each other.

849
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:45,490
Why are you being like this?

850
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:47,130
"It's over for us?"

851
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:49,500
"We have no reason
to see each other?"

852
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:53,330
Kim Ji Young. You can't be
doing this as a human being.

853
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:56,000
You shook me up
with some dumpling soup...

854
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,700
only a few days ago.

855
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:00,270
Why are you being like this
all of a sudden?

856
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:02,540
Be honest.

857
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,880
You're being like this
because of Ko Pil Seung, right?

858
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:07,310
Is that it?

859
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:08,980
Think whatever you want.

860
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:11,480
Whatever you do,
it has nothing to do with me.

861
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:17,390
And don't come to my place
ever again.

862
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,860
If you show up again,
I'll call the police.

863
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:24,900
What did you just say?
"Call the police?"

864
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:28,630
Hey. Am I a criminal or what?
Why would you call the police?

865
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:30,540
Is it a crime that I like you?

866
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:35,170
Because of you,

867
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:39,280
my wedding and adoption
got canceled.

868
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:41,450
And what did you just say?

869
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:46,620
Fine.

870
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:49,120
It's all because of Ko Pil Seung,
that idiot.

871
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:53,430
He stole my woman
and my chance to be adopted from me.

872
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,360
I will make him pay.

873
00:51:57,330 --> 00:51:59,160
Seriously, I'm going to kill...

874
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:02,030
Ko Pil Seung, that jerk.

875
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,850
Let's start.

876
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:15,380
Let me see.

877
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:26,260
All right. Let's begin.

878
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:30,760
My gosh.
I only had 20 dollars in my hand...

879
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:33,500
and was just going
to kill some time,

880
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,300
but I ended up winning
1,000 dollars.

881
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,870
On a day like this,
if I had tens of thousands of dollars,

882
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:41,640
I would've doubled the money.

883
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:43,640
What a shame.

884
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:46,150
I've got the skills,
but I don't have the seed money.

885
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,650
Is there anyone with some easy cash?

886
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:50,920
Then I can make a quick buck.

887
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:56,520
Did you tell Mr. Gong
you'd return his 300,000 dollars?

888
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,820
Where did you get the money?

889
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,060
From my grandma.

890
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,900
She got Ji Young a place to live...

891
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:07,770
and gave her 300,000 dollars.

892
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:11,300
Maybe Ji Young's grandma is...

893
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:13,540
a lot richer than she looks.

894
00:53:20,810 --> 00:53:23,780
Gosh, Do Jun.
I didn't know you were here.

895
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:24,950
How nice.

896
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:27,220
Yes. Ji Young told me
to come for dinner.

897
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:28,350
I see.

898
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:30,660
Ji Young. Here. Take this.

899
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:33,930
What is all this?

900
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,500
It's tangerines you like.

901
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:39,130
I was walking by a fruit store,
and the tangerines looked delicious.

902
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:40,730
So I thought of you and got some.

903
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:43,100
They are sweet,
so have them with your grandma.

904
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:45,500
Thank you.

905
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:47,810
Sure. No, give me the grapes.

906
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:50,280
Do Jun likes grapes.
I'll go wash them now.

907
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,410
Okay?

908
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:55,150
What's going on?
I heard a familiar voice.

909
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:58,420
Ms. Lee. I bought some fruit.

910
00:53:58,420 --> 00:53:59,590
It's for you.

911
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:01,590
I brought apples, tangerines,
and grapes.

912
00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:05,290
You're Dong Dong, right?
That's right. It's you.

913
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,290
My gosh. Dong Dong is back.

914
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:10,300
You're finally home.

915
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,400
I've been looking all over for you.

916
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:16,270
Where have you been the whole time?

917
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:18,000
My gosh.

918
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Grandma.

919
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,240
Ms. Lee, who's Dong Dong?

920
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,910
Ji Young, Do Jun.

921
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:26,550
She's your aunt.

922
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:28,610
My daughter, Dong Dong.

923
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:31,680
- Dong Dong?
- Yes, Dong Dong.

924
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,350
Oh, dear.

925
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:36,020
Where have you been the whole time?

926
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:39,860
By the way,
why does your face look so horrible?

927
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:42,660
Dong Dong, let's go to my room.

928
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:45,160
Come on in. My gosh.

929
00:54:45,830 --> 00:54:49,130
You should never leave me again.

930
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,540
Ji Young, what's going on?

931
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:56,440
I don't know.

932
00:54:57,310 --> 00:54:59,710
Grandma seems to think
Mom is her daughter.

933
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:04,720
Gosh, Dong Dong. My dear daughter.

934
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:12,020
Grandma.
Why are you being like this?

935
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:13,590
She's not my aunt.

936
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:16,930
Grandma, pull yourself together.

937
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:18,460
Ji Young.

938
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:21,770
You can't do this to your aunt.

939
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:24,900
Do you know
how much she cared about you?

940
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:26,940
Dong Dong.

941
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:30,410
Don't go anywhere now.

942
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:33,010
We should live together here.

943
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:34,210
Okay?

944
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:37,720
- What? Live here?
- Yes.

945
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:40,620
- You want to live with me?
- Sure.

946
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:42,390
Mom, I'm not going anywhere.

947
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:44,660
- All right.
- I'm not leaving. I'll live here.

948
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:47,630
- Mom! I'll live with you.
- Don't go anywhere.

949
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:50,330
- My gosh. My Dong Dong.
- Let's live together.

950
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:53,030
- I'll live with you.
- Dong Dong.

951
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,100
- Let's live together.
- My gosh.

952
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:59,070
(Art Studio)

953
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:16,790
Do Jun.

954
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,160
Give me that.

955
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,530
Do Jun, take me to the office today.

956
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,140
Are you not going home?

957
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:32,040
I'll have a date with my brother.

958
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,170
So drive me to the pasta place...

959
00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:36,910
near his office and go home.

960
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:38,780
Do you want me to come
and pick you up?

961
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:41,780
No. My brother will drive me home.

962
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:44,680
You should go home,
so you can study and rest.

963
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,320
I'll call you when it's over.

964
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:48,320
Okay.

965
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:51,290
Make sure to call me when it's over.

966
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,290
Sure.

967
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:55,190
You are my boyfriend now.

968
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:56,630
So I'll call you all the time.

969
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:58,300
You don't have to do that.

970
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:01,700
Let me. That's what I want to do.

971
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:03,700
Okay. Do whatever you want.

972
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:04,840
Let's go.

973
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,380
I didn't eat two servings.

974
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:39,940
In this scene, the emotions
of the actors are important.

975
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:41,410
- So there should be no bloopers.
- Okay.

976
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:43,140
Make sure that the directing team
will control the surroundings.

977
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:44,140
Okay.

978
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:50,220
We need to rehearse the scene.
Isn't Kang Bin here yet?

979
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,450
He's caught in traffic,
so it'll take about 30 minutes.

980
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:55,190
Really?

981
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,360
Ji Young.

982
00:57:58,190 --> 00:58:00,190
- Yes.
- Kang Bin is coming late.

983
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:01,460
Why don't you run
some lines with me?

984
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:02,630
Okay.

985
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,500
Bun Hong.

986
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:13,110
Why did you not tell me?

987
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:15,270
Why did you lie to me?

988
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:19,650
All I can do is just see you
without knowing anything.

989
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:21,510
Do you have any idea how it feels?

990
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,780
Don't like me anymore.

991
00:58:26,790 --> 00:58:28,190
I don't like you anymore.

992
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:31,060
If I like you,

993
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,890
it will only give you a hard time.

994
00:58:33,830 --> 00:58:35,430
So you should never like me.

995
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:39,400
I know you're lying.

996
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:41,900
You like me too.

997
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:43,670
No, I don't.

998
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:45,870
I said I didn't like you.

999
00:58:48,810 --> 00:58:50,310
I don't care if you don't love me...

1000
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:55,380
because I love you a lot.

1001
00:58:58,050 --> 00:58:59,420
That's why I want to protect you.

1002
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:02,620
So lean on me...

1003
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:05,390
and save yourself...

1004
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,930
from the pain and heartache.

1005
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:17,500
Director.

1006
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,410
Those lines aren't in the script.

1007
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:23,380
I know.

1008
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:29,580
But I knew I'd regret it
if I didn't tell you that.

1009
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:33,120
Back then,

1010
00:59:34,290 --> 00:59:36,490
I hurt you
in the worst way possible.

1011
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:39,290
However,

1012
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:42,060
wronging you isn't all that I did.

1013
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:44,630
We...

1014
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:47,270
shared many great moments together.

1015
00:59:48,670 --> 00:59:50,740
You'll know that
once you regain your memories.

1016
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:56,070
So, please trust me once again,
and see how things go.

1017
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:04,750
No.

1018
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:08,820
I don't want that.

1019
01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:11,390
I don't want to remember my past,

1020
01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:14,790
and I don't want
to date anyone either.

1021
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:18,200
All I want is to do a good job
on this project as Kim Ji Young.

1022
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:20,370
I just want to focus
on this project,

1023
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:23,800
so know that.

1024
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:25,870
Ji Young.

1025
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,310
I...

1026
01:00:28,810 --> 01:00:30,040
Just because I broke up
with Mr. Gong...

1027
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:32,010
doesn't mean I want to date you.

1028
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,950
And you said before...

1029
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:37,420
that you wanted me to forget
who I was as Do Ra...

1030
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,250
and live as Kim Ji Young.

1031
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:43,260
I'll live my life fully as her.

1032
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:46,260
You should forget about me...

1033
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:48,860
and meet someone better.

1034
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,030
That's what I want for you.

1035
01:00:54,370 --> 01:00:55,870
I'm afraid
I can't accept that request.

1036
01:00:57,100 --> 01:01:00,410
There won't be anyone else
that I want in my life.

1037
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:03,110
Of course,
there will be someone else.

1038
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:04,510
What are you talking about?

1039
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:08,480
This is exactly why
I don't like you.

1040
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:12,280
Why are you this stubborn and naive?

1041
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:15,450
Why would you even like
someone like me?

1042
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:17,060
Forget about me, okay?

1043
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:19,960
I won't regain my memories,

1044
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:22,260
and I won't go running back to you,

1045
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,900
so stop waiting for me.

1046
01:01:47,390 --> 01:01:48,790
Hey, Ma Ri.

1047
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:51,920
Hey, Pil Seung. I'm done
with my art class and am on my way.

1048
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:52,960
What about you?

1049
01:01:53,490 --> 01:01:55,460
I wrapped up filming
and arrived back at the office.

1050
01:01:55,930 --> 01:01:59,200
Then let's eat at the Italian place
near your office.

1051
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,330
I'll meet you there.

1052
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:01,730
Sure.

1053
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:04,140
What is it that you wanted
to say to me though?

1054
01:02:08,970 --> 01:02:10,540
That's for you to hear in person.

1055
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:12,540
It'll knock your socks off.

1056
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:14,710
I'm dying to know, but I'll wait.

1057
01:02:15,010 --> 01:02:16,310
You'll soon tell me.

1058
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:18,920
Sure. Get here safely.

1059
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:45,280
Pil Seung!

1060
01:02:48,110 --> 01:02:50,320
Ma Ri, stay there. I'll come to you.

1061
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,350
What?

1062
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:54,990
Ma Ri, no!

1063
01:03:15,370 --> 01:03:16,410
Pil Seung?

1064
01:03:18,910 --> 01:03:20,010
Pil Seung!

1065
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:23,880
Wasn't that a hit-and-run?

1066
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:25,580
- Did you catch the plates?
- No.

1067
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:26,750
Pil Seung...

1068
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:29,020
- I think he's hurt.
- Shouldn't we call an ambulance?

1069
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:30,660
- Pil Seung?
- Sure, I'll do that.

1070
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:32,690
Pil Seung, please wake up.

1071
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:34,790
Pil Seung?

1072
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:38,800
You can't die, Pil Seung.

1073
01:03:40,270 --> 01:03:42,070
Pil Seung, it's me.

1074
01:03:42,970 --> 01:03:44,440
It's Do Ra.

1075
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:46,770
Oh, no.

1076
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:49,740
Please help him.

1077
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:52,580
Please help him!

1078
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:56,550
Pil Seung, it's Do Ra.

1079
01:03:57,020 --> 01:04:00,050
I'm Do Ra, Pil Seung.

1080
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,990
It's Do Ra. Please wake up.

1081
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:05,660
Pil Seung!

1082
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:11,530
(Beauty and Mr. Romantic)

1083
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:45,300
What happened to Pil Seung?

1084
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,230
How badly is he hurt?

1085
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:48,270
I don't know.

1086
01:04:48,270 --> 01:04:49,900
He's in surgery.

1087
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:51,170
Our family was turned upside down.

1088
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,370
Ma Ri almost died, you see.

1089
01:04:52,370 --> 01:04:54,470
What about the half-brother?
Did he die?

1090
01:04:54,610 --> 01:04:56,610
There's a good chance
he'll actually die.

1091
01:04:56,710 --> 01:04:58,680
What, an unregistered car?

1092
01:04:58,710 --> 01:05:00,510
Was someone trying to kill him?

1093
01:05:00,510 --> 01:05:02,880
Are you saying
something could go wrong?

1094
01:05:02,910 --> 01:05:03,980
Please say that's not true.

1095
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:07,050
- No! What should I do now...
- Honey.

1096
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:08,850
Please don't let him die.

1097
01:05:09,390 --> 01:05:11,790
Please don't let him die.
