1
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,520
JEW
0014

2
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,320
Number 23, please.

3
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,400
Number 27, please.

4
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,080
PLENGPIN
0056

5
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,719
Do I seriously have to remind you again?

6
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,520
No one can know we know each other.

7
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,879
Chill, no one saw.

8
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,119
No need to tell me off.

9
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,480
And you're talking back to me.

10
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,119
This is also a no.

11
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,680
Just one. No one will smell it.

12
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,880
I said no. Cut it out.

13
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,359
Ajin, listen.

14
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,240
I'm about to go on stage for the audition.

15
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,959
So?

16
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,439
So I wanted to relax a bit, okay?

17
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,000
I may look fine, but I'm all stressed out.

18
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,440
No means no.

19
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,280
Then... help me focus like you always do.

20
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,760
Fine.

21
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,360
Close your eyes.

22
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,040
Next up, number 0056.

23
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,919
<i>What if I told you
this world holds things you can't see?</i>

24
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,240
<i>Would you believe me?</i>

25
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,080
<i>Like white and black.</i>

26
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,360
<i>Belief and truth.</i>

27
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,920
<i>In this world filled with lights,</i>

28
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,200
<i>how much darkness do you think exists?</i>

29
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,960
<i>Beneath the charming surface
lies something deeper, darker.</i>

30
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,440
<i>The principle of balance
no one can escape,</i>

31
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,280
<i>and not everyone understands.</i>

32
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,440
<i>But those who understand,</i>

33
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,799
<i>the ones who shine brightly,
able to hide their darkness perfectly,</i>

34
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,480
<i>will get everything they ever want.</i>

35
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,200
<i>Especially here,</i>

36
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,600
<i>a place full of lights...</i>

37
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,880
<i>lust and seduction,</i>

38
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,200
<i>and darkness.</i>

39
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,440
<i>You can't look away.</i>

40
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,440
GUYS, BIG NEWS.

41
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,359
DAMN, AUDITION TO FIND NEW FEMALE LEAD?

42
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,079
M.L. IN THE FLESH

43
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,919
THIS WILL GO VIRAL

44
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,999
THRILLING

45
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,839
THIS IS WHAT THE INDUSTRY NEEDS

46
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,759
NEW STAR IS BORN

47
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,800
WHO'S THIS ANYWAY?

48
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,919
My concept of Grandfather?

49
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:10,919
M.L. RAY
M.L. DANGRAYRAI PORAMANTIWA

50
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,800
He's my ideal,

51
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,599
not that I want to call myself
a national artist like him.

52
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,280
But he was a true artist.

53
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,839
He was obsessed with perfection

54
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,440
and understood all his crafts to the bone.

55
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:36,279
As you can see, his legendary works
speak for themselves.

56
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,800
All of them.

57
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,439
But his final work

58
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,680
was on a whole other level.

59
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,839
<i>Bu-nga Muen Phamorn</i>

60
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,439
was the final novel he composed
before he passed away.

61
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:59,480
He gave a clear order
to keep it a secret for 66 years.

62
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,040
Why?

63
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,080
I don't know.

64
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,280
His artistic whim, maybe?

65
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,919
But his instruction was clear.

66
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:16,999
After that, it must be published and
adapted as a stage play simultaneously.

67
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,840
And here's the best part.

68
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:28,560
The lead actress of this play will wear
the dress he made before he died.

69
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,839
So let me take this chance
to officially announce

70
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:45,079
that in six months,
I'll hold the biggest event ever

71
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,999
to find the lead actress for
<i>Bu-nga Muen Phamorn.</i>

72
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,720
I have only one task for you.

73
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,999
This is the first page of the novel.

74
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,239
No synopsis. Interpret it in your own way.

75
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,680
If you think you're ready, come prepared.

76
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,640
I'll see you there.

77
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:12,800
YOUR LIFE IS ABOUT TO CHANGE

78
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,079
Hey! Let go! I said, let go of me!

79
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,039
COUNTDOWN: 6 MONTHS TO
BU-NGA MUEN PHAMORN

80
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,880
You piece of shit!
You can't do this to me!

81
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,719
Your client made the first move.
He grabbed me!

82
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,120
What the hell?

83
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,960
Shit!

84
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,800
YOUR LIFE IS ABOUT TO CHANGE

85
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,480
Your name's Pin, right?

86
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,320
I met this family
who gave me your contact details.

87
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,320
You... don't look much like your photos.

88
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,079
- Wait.
- Hey! Let me go!

89
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,080
Calm down.

90
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,960
Can't you tell I mean no harm?

91
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,720
What do you want?

92
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,999
Why bury your past
and leave everything behind?

93
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,560
Do you even realize what you have in you?

94
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,040
What?

95
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,080
You want to audition
for <i>Bu-nga Muen Phamorn</i>, right?

96
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,920
I want access to the prize dress.

97
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,680
So if you're ready
to leave your past behind

98
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,040
and do whatever it takes
to win your dream role,

99
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,400
I'll help you win.

100
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,240
Who the hell are you?

101
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,600
Let's just say,

102
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,280
I'm a star maker.

103
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,679
Okay, all set.

104
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,479
Let's continue the interview.

105
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,719
Sure.

106
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,520
Your name is Plengpin, right?

107
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,840
Yes.

108
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,959
You've got a great foundation
in traditional dance.

109
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,120
Have you been training long?

110
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,279
Lift your foot a little higher.

111
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,359
<i>My family just wanted me to have a hobby.</i>

112
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,719
<i>So my mom had me</i>

113
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,080
start dancing from a young age.

114
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,479
So why did you decide to join
<i>Bu-nga Muen Phamorn?</i>

115
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,040
It just felt like fate, honestly.

116
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:30,719
My mom has been a huge fan
of M.L. Prisanan's novels for years,

117
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,599
so I've always felt
a strong connection to his work.

118
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,039
I've read it so many times,

119
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,319
and when I found out
about this competition--

120
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,280
Excuse me.

121
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,600
Your mom actually named you
after the novel when you were born?

122
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,479
Yes.

123
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,080
So it's not a new name
you've adopted recently?

124
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,040
Why are you asking?

125
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,160
Just that...

126
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:07,959
I saw online that you registered
your account only six months ago.

127
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,960
What a coincidence!

128
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,919
Oh, that.

129
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,039
My account got hacked,
so all my info was wiped.

130
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,080
How about this?

131
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,600
Tell me which verse is your favorite.

132
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,000
Didn't you just say

133
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,880
you've read the book multiple times?

134
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,440
To be blunt,

135
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,760
we're only looking for the real deal
in this contest.

136
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,799
Fakes... are just a waste
of hard disk space.

137
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,480
<i>The lyre's melody, forlorn
Whispers, laments, and yearns</i>

138
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,039
<i>A love profound, enchantingly drawn
A sonnet begging for a knight returns</i>

139
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,759
<i>The lyre string breaks a soul's demise
Blood freely pours</i>

140
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,920
<i>The song of love by the lyre forsakes
Silenced forevermore</i>

141
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,799
To be blunt too,

142
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,600
whether you believe me
or want to question who named me,

143
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,920
it doesn't matter to me at all.

144
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,519
But if you're gonna do me dirty

145
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,440
and accuse me of being fake,

146
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,040
you'd better be ready for me to hit back.

147
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,759
Damn. That sweet-looking girl
named Plengpin,

148
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,159
she's got a sharp tongue, man.

149
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,679
Right?

150
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,440
I was shook.

151
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,440
But...

152
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,000
But I kinda love it. Can I root for her?

153
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,279
Me too. We need someone like her.
That's what makes it fun.

154
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,599
Totally. Serves Aekasit right!

155
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,600
He was being a jerk anyway.

156
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,679
Oh no! Someone fainted!

157
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,719
- Who's that?
- Miss, are you okay? What's wrong?

158
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,799
Lie down first.

159
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,679
- Do you have an inhaler?
- No, I don't.

160
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,159
- No one has an inhaler? Anyone?
- No.

161
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,279
- Hey, call an ambulance, now.
- Calm down.

162
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,159
- Any inhaler?
- I'm sorry.

163
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,039
- Please, ask around.
- Call the hospital, please.

164
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,319
Hello. Hi!

165
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,799
- Why is she...?
- Miss, breathe slowly.

166
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,639
- Slowly.
- Easy, take it easy.

167
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,799
Breathe slowly.

168
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,759
Take it easy.

169
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,960
Did she hit her head?

170
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,159
Any inhaler?

171
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,240
Have you asked already?

172
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,880
Shit.

173
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,479
Hey, this didn't need to
turn into a huge deal.

174
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,000
We just talked for a second.

175
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,919
It's not about how long you talked.

176
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,760
The point is,
you disobeyed a direct order.

177
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,639
I told you to stay away from Anya.

178
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,000
- Was that really so hard to understand?
- Yeah, it kinda was.

179
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,799
All you ever say is, "Be careful."
You never give a real reason.

180
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,720
What do I know after six months?

181
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,639
One.

182
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,839
DO NOT ENGAGE

183
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,919
She's a famous model.

184
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,439
Two.

185
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,880
She used to date you.

186
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,559
Who is she really?
What makes her dangerous?

187
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,560
You've never told me any of it.

188
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,359
You could've at least said

189
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,600
how things ended between you.

190
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,120
You really think I don't know

191
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,319
why you were trying to get close to me?

192
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,440
Enough.

193
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,199
There are things better left unknown.

194
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,560
Just focus on what you're supposed to do.

195
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,999
Changing the subject again.

196
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,119
Plengpin, listen.

197
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:03,199
Our deal was that you would enter
this competition, and you'd win.

198
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,319
All I want is access to
the <i>Bu-nga Muen Phamorn</i> dress.

199
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,200
If anything goes wrong
and you're eliminated,

200
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,920
we're done. End of story.

201
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,560
I know that.

202
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,680
I will win.

203
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,080
We made a promise, didn't we?

204
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,880
Did we?

205
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,680
Nothing's guaranteed.

206
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,120
We might lose.

207
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,600
You know how unpredictable M.L. Ray is.

208
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,360
So what?

209
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,799
We've come too far to quit now.

210
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,439
These past six months,
I've trained my ass off

211
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,719
and followed every single plan you made.

212
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,520
And you?

213
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,160
You've been digging up info
like your life depends on it.

214
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,800
UNKNOWN FIRE
BURNS VICTIM ALIVE IN LAB ROOM

215
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,200
And besides, you're not exactly normal.

216
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,240
With the two of us
working together this hard...

217
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,960
it's time you stop doubting.

218
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,040
Good.

219
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,960
Then...

220
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,120
let's start prepping for the semifinals.

221
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,679
POETRY FROM THE NOVEL

222
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,360
BU-NGA MUEN PHAMORN
THE BEGINNING

223
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,159
From what I can tell, this should be
the first verse of the novel.

224
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,078
It's about a famous dressmaker
named Bu-nga.

225
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,559
She was cursed.
Any outfit she wore made her skin burn.

226
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,919
Until she found a magical fabric
that kept her cool.

227
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,118
But, of course,
it belonged to the city ruler.

228
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,359
Blah, blah, blah.

229
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,079
Anyway, looks like the next round
is gonna be based on this.

230
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,280
But seriously, what's with M.L. Ray?
He's totally eccentric.

231
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:30,719
We have to dig out a VHS player for this?

232
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,920
What a pain in the ass.

233
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,200
Yeah, he's nuts.

234
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,000
But you know what?

235
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,799
The whole thing's
about to go viral online.

236
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,839
GUYS, ISN'T THIS TOO INDIE?

237
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,759
Someone posted that the tape won't play.

238
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,479
Now people are dying to know what's in it.

239
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,280
And the harder it is to access,
the more obsessed people get.

240
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,919
M.L. Ray may seem quirky,

241
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:01,079
<i>but whether it's the previous trick
or this VHS stunt,</i>

242
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,000
<i>I'm sure he planned it all.</i>

243
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,080
That guy's more dangerous than we think.

244
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,080
Come on, let's practice the dance.

245
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,800
What's wrong?

246
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,639
I was just thinking,

247
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,120
if he's really that smart...

248
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,840
just copying the dance

249
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,960
feels kind of basic, doesn't it?

250
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,560
So?

251
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,920
SOUL BURNED INSIDE THE HEART

252
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,360
Wow.

253
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,720
The lighting team's giving us
something stunning here.

254
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,919
Damn, she went all in!

255
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,240
That's gutsy as hell.

256
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,199
Seriously.

257
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,520
If it were me,
I'd be dying of embarrassment.

258
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,520
Oh, please.

259
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,120
Just look at your outfit.

260
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,120
You clearly planned to pull
the same stunt.

261
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,959
What? No way!

262
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,319
I just happen to be wearing
two layers today.

263
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,079
You, on the other hand...

264
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,920
Your outfit underneath
is probably way skimpier.

265
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,120
We'll see, won't we?

266
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,599
What do you think?

267
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,080
This one's definitely
making it through, right?

268
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,560
No idea.

269
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,640
I guess we've got nothing to worry about.

270
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,280
Staff!

271
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,440
Geez, today was brutal.

272
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,840
Ajin?

273
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,720
Ajin?

274
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,840
EVERYTHING IS IN HERE

275
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,400
Would it kill you to wait
and hear the results with me?

276
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,440
Whatever.

277
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,720
And the result is...

278
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:01,520
ELIMINATED

279
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,920
ELIMINATED

280
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,679
ANYONE KNOW WHO MADE IT?

281
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,119
TONS OF PEOPLE DIDN'T PASS.

282
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,439
EVEN THE ELIMINATION CARD
IS DRAMATIC. SO EXTRA.

283
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,120
What the actual hell is going on?

284
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,680
<i>Sorry, the number you have dialed
is currently unavailable.</i>

285
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,840
Sorry.

286
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,440
Oh!

287
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,640
Do we know each other?

288
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,720
Oh, no.

289
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,440
You're Anya, right?
I'm actually a big fan.

290
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,759
Really? That's sweet of you.

291
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,280
I hope you make it through.

292
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,440
Thanks.

293
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,200
But watch out for that guy.

294
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,199
The moment you're no longer useful,

295
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,920
he'll drop you like you're nothing.

296
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,640
Yes?

297
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,320
Excuse me.

298
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,160
Hey there.

299
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,200
You're here already?

300
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,520
Here you are.

301
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,039
It's cold here. Have something warm first.

302
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,479
Thank you.

303
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,240
Also, sorry for calling you in
for this last-minute reshoot.

304
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,120
But didn't I get eliminated already?

305
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,840
Everyone got the same letter.

306
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,880
But the truth is, you actually made it.

307
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,440
M.L. Ray just wants to keep it top secret.

308
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,480
Okay, let's get to the interview.

309
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,960
Introduce yourself.

310
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,079
Hello, I'm Plengpin Piengamorn.

311
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,800
I'm 27 years old.

312
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,439
What do you do for work?

313
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,879
A little of everything.

314
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,400
Events, commercials...

315
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,559
I'm open to most kinds of jobs.

316
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,880
Open to everything, huh?

317
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,320
Hold on a sec.

318
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,520
Sorry. Your top's done up a bit tight.

319
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,120
Can you unbutton one for me?

320
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,120
Nice.

321
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,000
So when you say "open to any job,"

322
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:41,720
how far are you willing to go?

323
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,440
- What do you mean by that?
- Sorry.

324
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,960
You mind unbuttoning one more for me?

325
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,480
Isn't this already too much?

326
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,919
What's the problem?

327
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,199
I saw you were showing way
more skin earlier today.

328
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,839
In this industry, if you're too uptight
and overthink everything,

329
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,519
you're not gonna last.

330
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,040
I need to call my manager first.

331
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,200
Hey, careful.

332
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,640
If you fall over now,
it'll spoil the goods.

333
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,200
You... What the hell
did you put in my drink?

334
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,520
Hey, man.

335
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,040
Oh, you're awake.

336
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,920
Don't panic.

337
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,240
What the hell did you do to me?!

338
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,280
You really don't get it, do you?

339
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,720
That "you made it through" story?

340
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,080
Total lie.

341
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,159
You really were eliminated.

342
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,279
Your manager didn't want
to leave empty-handed,

343
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,480
so he sold you to us.

344
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,399
Which means

345
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,160
I can do whatever I want with you.

346
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,799
No, no, no! This isn't real.

347
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,120
- Don't overthink it.
- Let me go!

348
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,759
You'll get used to it.

349
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,759
No! No!

350
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,880
She's tough.

351
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,239
Here, take this.

352
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,399
Now tell me...

353
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,119
Which style do you want to go for?

354
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,959
- My clients are into all kinds of things.
- I said let go!

355
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,399
You want to go the sexy route?
Or bloody and intense?

356
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,519
It's all on the table.

357
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,240
I said let go!

358
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,760
Hey! Hey!

359
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,000
What the hell is this?!

360
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,600
Let me go! What is this?!

361
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,840
This isn't real.

362
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,120
This can't be real.

363
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,920
It's not real.

364
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,120
It's not real.

365
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,360
It's not real.

366
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,520
Help!

367
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,560
Somebody help me!

368
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,440
Can anyone hear me? Help!

369
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,560
<i>Any last words before you die?</i>

370
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,479
What the hell is this?!

371
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,920
What do you want from me?

372
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,560
<i>Any last words before you die?</i>

373
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,639
I asked you, what do you want?!

374
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,479
<i>Any last words before you die?</i>

375
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,559
Who are you?! Say something!

376
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,279
<i>Any last words before you die?</i>

377
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,679
Talk to me!

378
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,919
<i>Any last words before you die?</i>

379
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:51,119
- What do you want?! I'm talking to you!
- <i>Any last words before you die?</i>

380
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,919
Can't you say anything else?!

381
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,640
<i>Any last words before you die?</i>

382
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,120
<i>Any last words before you die?</i>

383
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,440
<i>Any last words before you die?</i>

384
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,280
<i>Any last words before you die?</i>

385
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,840
<i>Any last words before you die?</i>

386
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,238
<i>Any last words before you die?</i>

387
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,320
Mom.

388
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,480
Mom, are you watching?

389
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,320
I'm sorry...

390
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,239
I never made you proud.

391
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:47,120
But today, I finally found
something that matters.

392
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:50,480
Something that could've made you proud.

393
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:58,360
And I failed again.

394
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,080
I'm sorry, Mom.

395
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,480
I miss you.

396
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:31,920
We'll see each other soon, okay?

397
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,079
And that was the performance
from Plengpin,

398
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,480
our final contestant of the show.

399
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,079
Your show was extraordinary.

400
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,040
It felt so real.

401
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,320
I am truly impressed.

402
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:26,239
And now, the real competition begins.

403
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,279
Who will win?

404
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,160
Who will be chosen by <i>Bu-nga Muen Phamorn</i>?

405
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,360
Stay tuned.

406
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,199
<i>This round's challenge recreated
a scene from the novel</i>

407
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,279
<i>when Bu-nga was about to be
executed by the city ruler.</i>

408
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,479
<i>But her heartfelt plea
triggered a miracle.</i>

409
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,879
<i>From being spared to being tasked
with crafting a magical dress,</i>

410
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,959
<i>the beginning of an incredible journey.</i>

411
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,959
<i>After an intense battle
where no one held back,</i>

412
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,719
<i>we finally have our four finalists,
each equally exceptional.</i>

413
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:13,039
<i>Anya, the talented model and actress.</i>

414
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,439
At the time,
I just wanted to give it my all

415
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,079
so I wouldn't regret anything later.

416
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:22,199
<i>Jew, the skilled dancer
and multiple-time competition winner.</i>

417
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,999
Huge thanks to M.L. Ray

418
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,359
for helping us break past
so many boundaries.

419
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,399
<i>Myday, the influencer everyone's watching.</i>

420
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,999
This really took my performance
to the next level.

421
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,839
I'm seriously blown away.

422
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:39,439
<i>And Plengpin, a fresh face
with a one-of-a-kind character.</i>

423
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,680
Now I get it.

424
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,800
No wonder M.L. Ray is so famous.

425
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,920
Real talk.

426
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,959
What they did to stage that scene,

427
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,559
that was messed up.

428
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,799
Under normal circumstances, he'd be sued.

429
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,159
Yeah, but who'd dare sue him?

430
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:57,359
Everyone, once you're done with touch-ups,
let's get ready to shoot the final part.

431
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,279
It's getting late.
Time for bed after this.

432
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,399
Move it, girl!

433
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,960
Still sulking?

434
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,199
All good here?

435
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,239
Bastard.

436
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,320
Come on!

437
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,399
<i>And to keep things absolutely secret
for the next two months,</i>

438
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,559
<i>all four contestants will be hidden away
deep in the forest</i>

439
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,239
<i>at the Poramantiwa family's old estate.</i>

440
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,239
<i>A place no outsider has ever seen.</i>

441
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,959
<i>But before the next round begins,</i>

442
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,640
<i>there's still one final event,
M.L. Ray's most special surprise.</i>

443
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,720
Come in. Take a seat.

444
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,799
I'm so excited.

445
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,160
Even though I can't show you
the actual preserved dress yet,

446
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,599
this will be the first time
we're seeing a completed image

447
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,360
of the authentic <i>Bu-nga Muen Phamorn</i> dress

448
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,160
that my grandfather crafted.

449
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,199
<i>At that moment, it felt like...</i>

450
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,919
<i>Okay, maybe this sounds dramatic,</i>

451
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,720
but it really felt like time just stopped.

452
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,000
<i>Everyone froze, totally in sync.</i>

453
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,799
I remember...

454
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,160
my hands went completely numb.

455
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,759
<i>We've only ever seen
unfinished sketches before, right?</i>

456
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,959
<i>But seeing the real thing</i>

457
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,160
is breathtaking.

458
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,160
<i>It doesn't even feel like
something made by human hands.</i>

459
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,520
<i>Why am I crying?</i>

460
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,560
I don't even know.

461
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,000
I'm just overwhelmed.

462
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,879
Only one of you

463
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,920
will earn the highest honor
of wearing this dress to perform.

464
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,520
Even I am jealous of you.

465
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:00,439
<i>And so the day ended with smiles
and awe from all four contestants.</i>

466
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:04,919
<i>There will be many more
challenges to come,</i>

467
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,519
<i>but they're ready for it, fully motivated.</i>

468
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,119
<i>Who will be the winner?</i>

469
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,640
<i>Let's cheer them on together.</i>

470
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,000
<i>See you in the next episode.
Goodbye for now.</i>

471
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,600
Okay, wonderful!

472
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,720
You've all truly impressed me.

473
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,280
So, sir, no comments or edits?

474
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,680
Your impeccable work
leaves me nothing to fix.

475
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,720
Actually, just one thing.

476
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,679
The girl named Plengpin.

477
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,800
Why didn't we use more of her interview?

478
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,640
<i>How I felt seeing the dress
for the first time?</i>

479
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,600
<i>I felt...</i>

480
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,960
<i>uncomfortable.</i>

481
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,879
<i>Yeah, uncomfortable.</i>

482
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:13,360
<i>Something felt off. I don't know why.</i>

483
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,239
<i>No, seriously, I really felt that way.</i>

484
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,440
<i>What else do you want me to say?</i>

485
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,880
Good thing we didn't use that.

486
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,439
Everyone, excellent work.

487
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,840
I'm counting on you.

488
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,240
So this is where you've been hiding.

489
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,640
How's today been?

490
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,360
It was fine.

491
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,760
Let me guess.
Ajin told you not to talk to me?

492
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:46,399
Wow, your face gives it away so fast.

493
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,360
You're terrible at hiding your emotions,
you know that?

494
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,880
Come on, what do you really want?

495
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,840
Give me one?

496
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,600
I forgot to bring mine.

497
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,760
That'll cost you.

498
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:36,360
Wait, you don't even know how to smoke.
So why are you here?

499
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,840
I came to tell you to drop the hell out.

500
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,880
I'm saying this
out of the goodness of my heart.

501
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,360
You're the only one
who can't keep up with the show.

502
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,400
What's that supposed to mean?

503
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,160
That fake execution scene earlier?

504
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,839
Everyone else knew.

505
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,520
They just played along.

506
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,559
So sad, right?

507
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,360
Crying and calling for your dead mom.

508
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,720
But the important part is,

509
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,040
you don't know the truth about
the <i>Bu-nga Muen Phamorn</i> dress, do you?

510
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,360
What are you talking about?

511
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,520
Ajin hasn't changed.

512
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,120
He's still just using people.

513
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:37,200
This dress is way too dangerous
for a regular person,

514
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,920
someone who doesn't understand magic
like you.

515
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,360
Magic?

516
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,560
You noticed it, didn't you?

517
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:52,520
You were the only one
who felt uncomfortable.

518
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,720
Others felt it too.

519
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,480
But they knew how to deal with it
in their own way.

520
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,400
Real insiders in the world
of magic all know

521
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,840
M.L. Ray's grandfather was
a legendary practitioner.

522
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,160
He created some seriously cursed objects.

523
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,960
There's one artifact,

524
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:44,639
<i>and legend says he secretly sacrificed
no fewer than ten virgin girls,</i>

525
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,199
<i>flayed their skin,
stitched it onto fabric with spells,</i>

526
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,600
<i>and sealed it with his own blood.</i>

527
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,280
That became the most dangerous
cursed dress ever made.

528
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,160
That's right. What you saw today was fake.

529
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:19,200
<i>Just cheap CGI for filming.</i>

530
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,920
<i>The real one?</i>

531
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,240
<i>They can never show it to the public.</i>

532
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,840
<i>And that's the real</i>
Bu-nga Muen Phamorn <i>dress.</i>

533
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,640
<i>Now do you get it?</i>

534
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:50,720
This isn't some regular casting
for a TV drama.

535
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,919
<i>M.L. Ray is way more unhinged
than you think.</i>

536
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,000
<i>He probably doesn't even
realize it himself.</i>

537
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:02,600
<i>But what he's really doing
is looking for the right sorceress</i>

538
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,720
<i>to wear that cursed dress.</i>

539
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,400
Kinda funny, huh?

540
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,120
Under the lights and cameras,

541
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,639
the person who hides
in the shadows the best

542
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,040
is the one who wins.

543
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,519
You think I actually believe any of that?

544
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,800
Fine, don't believe me.

545
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,920
But I'll say it one last time.

546
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,760
Normal people can't handle this.

547
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:45,720
Especially here, where no one
from the outside can get in.

548
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,919
You probably don't have Ajin
to help you anymore.

549
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,120
Right?

550
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:55,600
Just quit.

551
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,880
I'm only saying this because I mean well.

552
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,400
I don't want anyone to end up dead.

553
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,040
<i>Listen, Plengpin.</i>

554
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,560
This competition is seriously dangerous.

555
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,479
The winner will not only need to
understand magic the best

556
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,320
and know the entertainment world
inside out.

557
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:26,000
She also needs to be able to lie
to everyone else.

558
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:31,200
<i>If you can do that, we win.</i>

559
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,720
But if the lie's too perfect,

560
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,720
isn't that boring?

561
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,520
What did you just say?

562
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,480
Thanks for the warning, Anya.

563
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:59,760
But you got three things wrong.

564
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:05,800
First, my mom's not dead.

565
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,719
That crying, that whole monologue?

566
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,079
Totally acting.

567
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:15,440
Still, I'm flattered that someone
like you thought it was real.

568
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,280
Second,

569
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,760
you said I'm just a regular person?

570
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,200
Wrong again.

571
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,520
So what?

572
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,400
You practice magic.

573
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:01,200
But do you really think
you're gonna beat me at this game?

574
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,520
And finally...

575
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:24,520
you said Ajin can't help me in this place.

576
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,200
I don't think that's true.

577
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:30,720
How is that possible?

578
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,800
I've already said too much.

579
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,000
Not gonna spoil anything else.

580
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:47,800
But thanks again, Anya, for your concern.

581
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,200
Let's hope this competition...

582
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,320
turns out to be fun.

583
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:23,000
Yo, hotshot! You spacing out?

584
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,120
Sorry about that.

585
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,760
Here are the show details for tomorrow.

586
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,439
When my assistant got sick out of nowhere,

587
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,000
I thought we were screwed.

588
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,720
But with you stepping in, I can relax now.

589
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,560
Welcome aboard
as my new assistant, hotshot.

590
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:49,639
Thanks.

591
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,320
I'm gonna make this show
as fun as possible.

592
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:03,799
This next round won't be solo.

593
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,400
You'll perform in pairs.

594
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:12,160
<i>This whole contest is really about finding
out who the cursed dress will choose.</i>

595
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,440
<i>These challenges,
all the games we're competing in,</i>

596
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:17,800
<i>they don't matter at all.</i>

597
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,479
Someone put shards of glass
in Myday's shoes.

598
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,399
An enemy is still an enemy.

599
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,159
But acting like a jackass like this...

600
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,719
- Stop!
- Are you messing with me?

601
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,800
<i>...doesn't really help anyone.</i>
