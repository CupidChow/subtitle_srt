1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:06,680
Our winner is Plengpin!
Give her a big hand!

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,440
Starting tomorrow,
your life's going to change completely.

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,480
Thank you, Ajin.

4
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,320
Hey, don't get too excited.

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,320
Don't tease me. I'm perfectly fine.

6
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,920
Don't forget. You can't have
the dress in the footage.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,120
I know.

8
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,680
22 May 2007.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,680
Our first day collecting samples from

10
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,120
the Bu-nga Muen Phamorn dress.

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,440
It's a legendary artifact.

12
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,920
Everyone into the occult has heard of it.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,160
And now, it's right here in front of us.

14
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,840
We've brought

15
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,000
almost every piece of gear we have,

16
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,200
as we don't know what we'll encounter.

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,080
But I strongly believe

18
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,360
we'll decode something for sure.

19
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,240
June 5, 2007.

20
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,400
Two weeks into
the experiment.

21
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,560
The lab results are in.

22
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,640
Nothing special.

23
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,320
No matter what we did,

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,440
no response.

25
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,320
Zero reaction.

26
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,240
It's nothing but
an ordinary old costume.

27
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,520
But we're not giving up.

28
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,600
We'll find something
for sure.

29
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Four months, 28 days.

30
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,320
Anan and the rest of the team

31
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,800
have started talking about
shelving the project.

32
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,200
Just a worthless piece of junk, huh?!

33
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,080
Then what the hell
have I been doing all this time?

34
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,000
Ow!

35
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,800
You! How could you do this to me?!

36
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,280
Let go!

37
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,560
Who are you?

38
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,680
Come on, people. Pick up the pace.

39
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,600
We're live in a few minutes.

40
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,280
You already know, don't you,

41
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,520
what's inside that cabinet?

42
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,520
And you're not scared?

43
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,440
Sometimes I just don't
get people like you.

44
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,960
You know exactly what's in there,
but still want to snatch it for yourself.

45
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,080
And it's not just you who knows, is it?

46
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,720
You really don't know

47
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,920
who those people are?

48
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,200
What people?

49
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,120
Well, we're going in circles here.

50
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,960
If you don't want to answer, fine.

51
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,560
Ajin,

52
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,000
I want to say thanks.

53
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,440
You really made this competition magical.

54
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,160
Thank you.

55
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,200
And I think it's finally time
to say goodbye to Grandfather.

56
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,640
Grandfather…

57
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,920
I've completed the contest.

58
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,880
I hope you're satisfied

59
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,440
and that you can move on
to a better place.

60
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,560
And if you die a second time, please
don't leave weird last wishes like this!

61
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,000
It's been total chaos

62
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,840
cleaning up after all these deaths
for one event.

63
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,080
What kind of haunted competition is this?

64
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,520
Good riddance, Damn Grandfather.

65
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,720
Finally! No more shit to deal with!

66
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,520
Let's get back to doing what we love.

67
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,560
Sir, something's happened!

68
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,600
Plengpin's gone from the dressing room.

69
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,080
How could she be gone?

70
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,560
Where's the person who was
guarding the door?

71
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,400
Uh, well…

72
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,280
Ajin!

73
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,880
Get the crew to search everywhere. Go!

74
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,800
Yes.

75
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,120
We're about to go live. Will they make it?

76
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,720
Plengpin…

77
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,640
Ajin!

78
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,720
Ajin!

79
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,800
Please help me.

80
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,160
Someone kidnapped me.

81
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,280
Please, get me back there.

82
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,560
Where's Plengpin?

83
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,400
What are you talking about?

84
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,560
Where did you take Plengpin, Jew?

85
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,320
Tell me.

86
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,040
I won't hurt you.

87
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,040
How did you know?

88
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,440
How did you know?

89
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,680
How did you know?

90
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,920
That's enough, Jew!
Tell me where Plengpin is.

91
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm not telling!

92
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,480
Why should I?

93
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,080
Get a grip, Jew.

94
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,760
You've lost.

95
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,080
It's over.

96
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,320
No, it's not over!

97
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,440
It's not over! It's not!

98
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,360
It's not over!

99
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,920
It's not over!

100
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,120
You don't know anything.

101
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,840
It's not over.

102
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,040
That's right. See this?

103
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,200
The story isn't finished yet. Look.

104
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,800
There's still an epilogue hidden inside.

105
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,080
Want me to read it to you?

106
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,919
Ten years later,

107
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,840
Bu-nga gave her life
and became a great tree.

108
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,080
Then one day,

109
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,720
a new prince of the kingdom
stumbled upon her.

110
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,960
He saw a parasitic vine
wrapped around the tree.

111
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,280
So he stepped closer,

112
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,680
hoping to pull it off.

113
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,560
But then he discovered something.

114
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,920
So he decided to draw his sword

115
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,480
and scrape away the bark.

116
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,400
Slice.

117
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,720
Slice.

118
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,640
Slice, slice, slice.

119
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,840
Slice!

120
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,920
- Jew! That's enough, Jew.
- Slice!

121
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,320
Slice!

122
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,920
- Jew!
- Slice!

123
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,840
Get a grip.

124
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,000
Let go!

125
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,520
Let me go!

126
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,880
Let go!

127
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,760
Let go!

128
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,320
Plengpin.

129
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,920
Are you hurt?

130
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,640
Oh my goodness.

131
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,280
Film it. Get it now.

132
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,160
I won't give up.

133
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,400
I won't!

134
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,960
Jew, what's wrong with you?

135
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,880
Are we recording this?

136
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,920
I'm sorry you all have to
see me like this.

137
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,960
But I'll do my best.

138
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,520
I'll keep on fighting.

139
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,160
I'll get the Bu-nga dress back.

140
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,200
Enough, Jew.

141
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,480
- What more do you want?
- What do I want?

142
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,040
I don't want it to end like this.

143
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:11,160
I did everything,
whatever Kosum told me to do.

144
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,920
Kosum?

145
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,080
I'm not second place.

146
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,840
I'll never give up.

147
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,440
Stop it, Jew.

148
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,840
What is happening?

149
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,440
Geez!

150
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,640
Hide the body first.

151
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,640
We'll deal with it after the show.

152
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,120
No more of this.

153
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
I'm practically a serial killer now.

154
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,080
Well,

155
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,080
at least I get to see
the ending I always wanted.

156
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,920
All right.

157
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,080
We're going live. Let's go.

158
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,280
Hey, what's wrong?

159
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,200
I think I twisted my ankle
when I was kidnapped.

160
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,040
Please go ahead.

161
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,160
I'll give her first aid and follow.

162
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,680
Fine.

163
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,120
I'll let you two have a moment alone.

164
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:16,040
You are the prince of this story,
after all, Ajin.

165
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,960
Thank you…

166
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,880
my prince.

167
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,080
Don't tease me.

168
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,480
Wait here.

169
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,200
Edit that into the show.

170
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,960
Make it part of the story.

171
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,280
But for Jew's part, cut it out.

172
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,520
Keep only the…

173
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,960
WHO IS THE WINNER
OF BU-NGA MUEN PHAMORN?

174
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:20,960
Okay.

175
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,880
Done. Let's go.

176
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,360
What is it?

177
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,960
Did you hear that sound?

178
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,320
Like bark splitting.

179
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,120
No.

180
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,680
Oh?

181
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,000
Then never mind. Let's go.

182
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,720
Let go! I said let go!

183
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,720
Let go!

184
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,560
Who are you?

185
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,680
Answer me now.

186
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,960
Calm down, M.L. Ray.

187
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,280
We're just here to perform
the final ritual.

188
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,160
That's all.

189
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,080
Oh, right.

190
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,760
There's something I haven't told you yet.

191
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,280
What is it?

192
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,240
Thank you so much…

193
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,920
for everything.

194
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,440
Plengpin.

195
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,200
What are you doing?

196
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,560
Yeah… what have I done?

197
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,080
Why are you being crazy?

198
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,760
This word "crazy"…

199
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,600
whose definition are we using?

200
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,080
Mine…

201
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,360
or someone else's?

202
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,280
Oh.

203
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,920
What's happening to me?

204
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:20,119
Confused?

205
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:31,960
But have you noticed that confusion…

206
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,160
chaos…

207
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,680
and disorder…

208
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,320
often give us the greatest works of art?

209
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,080
Who the hell are you?

210
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,800
Take a guess.

211
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,000
I don't know you.

212
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,880
You're not Kosum.

213
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,600
Close enough.

214
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,920
And yes,

215
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,000
the two of us have never been acquainted.

216
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,200
If we've never met, how would I know you?

217
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,520
Why not?

218
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,000
There are so many other possibilities.

219
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,320
Try looking at the bigger picture.

220
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,640
Otherwise, where's the fun?

221
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,200
Fun, my ass!

222
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,800
Quit messing with me and tell me.

223
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,240
Who are you?

224
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,400
Where's Plengpin?

225
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,640
Tell me--

226
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,680
I suppose it's understandable.

227
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,600
It's like when you're reading a novel

228
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,800
and an entire middle chapter is missing.

229
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,760
It's hard to piece things together.

230
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,240
So…

231
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,840
I'll tell you that chapter.

232
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,040
It's a story that happened 17 years ago

233
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,320
about a character named…

234
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,840
Kosum.

235
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,440
Have you never wondered

236
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:47,760
when Kosum said she began
connecting with God,

237
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,840
what exactly happened?

238
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,720
Four months, 28 days.

239
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,880
Anan and the rest of the team

240
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,720
have started talking about
shelving the project.

241
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,880
So it's just a worthless
piece of junk, huh?

242
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,880
Then what the hell
have I been doing all this time?

243
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,800
Ow!

244
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,160
Ow!

245
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,120
You!

246
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,200
How could you do this to me?!

247
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,360
I've been trying to communicate
with you this whole time,

248
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,120
and all you've given me is silence, huh?!

249
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,360
Let go!

250
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,480
Let go!

251
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,480
Let go!

252
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,680
Kosum was a pitiful woman.

253
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,240
A girl hopelessly wishing that one day
the spotlight would shine on her.

254
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,800
But then…

255
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,120
sometimes, stories move forward…

256
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,000
through a twist of fate.

257
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,200
Even if it was by chance,

258
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,560
Kosum eventually discovered
something extraordinary,

259
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,880
like a miracle.

260
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,120
Her equipment was able
to connect with something.

261
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:31,320
And at the time, he called himself…

262
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,680
Who are you?

263
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,520
Enigma.

264
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,920
Correct.

265
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,880
And after that, under Enigma's guidance,

266
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,320
Kosum began moving according to his will.

267
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,520
She gained knowledge,

268
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,360
a new life,

269
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,240
a new identity,

270
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,600
and the spotlight

271
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,440
she had always dreamed of.

272
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,720
From an ordinary girl

273
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,600
to the leader of an organization that
created countless talented people.

274
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,760
And finally,

275
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,480
Enigma entrusted her with
the most important mission of all.

276
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,440
Do you know what it was?

277
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,280
It was to find the most perfect body

278
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,880
for Enigma.

279
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,960
Now then…

280
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,920
back to the first question you asked.

281
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,680
Do you know now who I am?

282
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,960
You already told me you're…

283
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,000
Stop!

284
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,600
Don't touch that cabinet!

285
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,360
Stay away from it!

286
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,160
I said stop!

287
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,880
Wait…

288
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,640
You are…?

289
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,920
Could it be… you?

290
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,440
Pleased to meet you.

291
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,360
I am…

292
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,320
Prisanan Poramantiwa.

293
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,760
You're Prisanan.

294
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,640
Yes.

295
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,240
Prisanan,

296
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,400
the author of Bu-nga Muen Phamorn.

297
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,840
But you can still call me
Enigma if you want.

298
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,120
I don't mind.

299
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,560
But come to think of it,

300
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,520
the threads of fate

301
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,920
always seem to play tricks on us.

302
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,760
You probably never thought

303
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,160
that the Enigma you've been chasing
all this time

304
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,840
would end up this close to you.

305
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,040
Impossible.

306
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,200
Helping each other.

307
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,880
Being close.

308
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,560
Impossible.

309
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,720
Being intimate.

310
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,880
Impossible!

311
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,560
Strange.

312
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,120
You still have strength left?

313
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,440
Oh, I forgot.

314
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,200
You can heal yourself.

315
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,680
But anyway,

316
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,120
it looks like time is up.

317
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,920
It's a pity, but I'm sorry

318
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,680
I can't stay and chat with you any longer.

319
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,920
I'll leave it to you.

320
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,560
Let go of me!

321
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,480
Let go of me!

322
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,520
It's really time for us
to say goodbye, Ajin.

323
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,600
Thank you for everything.

324
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,400
I had so much fun.

325
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,640
And as a thank you,

326
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,720
I'll make your death…

327
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,200
the most elegant one.

328
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,920
Any last words?

329
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,520
How did you do it?

330
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,720
How did you move into Plengpin's body?

331
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,120
She never even came near you.

332
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,760
You knew?

333
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,440
I'm flattered.

334
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,880
But you asked the wrong question, Ajin.

335
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,400
Because 17 years ago,

336
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,000
I woke up for the first time

337
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,200
because of Kosum, right?

338
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,120
Which means

339
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,120
what you should be asking

340
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,320
is not how I did it,

341
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,120
but instead,

342
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:28,960
when I moved into her body.

343
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,960
Isn't that right, hotshot?

344
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,920
Don't be alarmed.

345
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,480
Even Kosum herself
doesn't know about this.

346
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,760
Everything I did

347
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,640
was just to be as close
to this competition as possible.

348
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,320
But thank you again, Ajin,

349
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,520
for bringing someone like Plengpin here

350
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,560
so I could interact with her

351
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,560
and explore her with my own eyes.

352
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,080
And in the end,

353
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,880
I was certain.

354
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,200
Do you know

355
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,000
how wonderful

356
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,520
that moment was?

357
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,400
The sight before mewas truly beautiful.

358
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,240
It was like a work of art.

359
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,360
No way.

360
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,960
- And at that moment, I knew.
- No way.

361
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,200
The competition had ended.

362
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,280
No. No way.

363
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,600
I'd found the one I wanted.

364
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,600
Plengpinwas the most perfect of all,

365
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,800
even better than the one Kosum chose.

366
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,920
And if it weren't for you,

367
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,520
I wouldn't have gotten
this most beautiful ending.

368
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,200
Thank you again

369
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,920
and goodbye…

370
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,280
my prince.

371
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,720
If you have to blame something,

372
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,360
blame your own stupidity.

373
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,800
Because the path you chose

374
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,520
was wrong from the very beginning.

375
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,440
Wrong from the very first
button you fastened.

376
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,920
The Leklai stone?

377
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,880
If you hadn't thrown it away that day…

378
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:10,639
maybe you wouldn't have to die today.

379
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,199
Right?

380
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,840
Goodbye,

381
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,719
Ajin.

382
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,680
Thank you for everything,

383
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,000
my dear grandson.

384
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:32,000
What if I told you
this world holds things you can't see?

385
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,120
Would you believe me?

386
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,960
In this world filled with lights,

387
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,880
how much darkness do you think exists?

388
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,400
Light

389
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,800
and darkness.

390
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,760
White

391
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,800
and black.

392
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:55,880
The principle of balance that no one
can escape in any industry.

393
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,760
In the end, those who understand,

394
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:06,400
the ones who shine brightly,
able to hide their darkness perfectly,

395
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,360
will get everything they ever want.

396
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,680
Everything.

397
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,840
This next story is
trending on social media

398
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:19,840
because it's a major role change
for a beloved actress.

399
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,000
If you recall, five years ago,
there was a tragic incident.

400
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,920
A massive fire at the theater

401
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,960
where the Bu-nga Muen Phamorn
competition was filmed

402
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,520
killed all staff and contestants…

403
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,680
ALL DEAD

404
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:42,760
…except for one miraculous survivor,
the winner, Plengpin Piengamorn.

405
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,520
After that, she had
many high-profile roles.

406
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:53,160
But recently, she became an aide
to Ratt Rattanatrakul,

407
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:59,040
a well-known politician running for
Bangkok governor next term.

408
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,840
While public reception
has been very positive,

409
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,880
this move has given the opposition party
ammunition to attack,

410
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,320
claiming Ratt is using
Plengpin's celebrity status

411
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,840
to boost his popularity.

412
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,160
If I really wanted to use Plengpin
to grab the spotlight,

413
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,640
I'd have to put her
on the frontline a lot more.

414
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,360
But it's up to her, really.

415
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,520
She feels more comfortable working
behind the scenes.

416
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,640
And I respect her decision.

417
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,600
But it seems the party's social media

418
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,240
mostly posts photos and clips of Plengpin.

419
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,920
Wouldn't that count as capitalizing
on her celebrity status?

420
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,840
Well, if you put it that way…

421
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:48,280
Okay, there's some of that,
but only a little.

422
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:53,920
We also post about
party policies and such.

423
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,680
I had my team count the posts.

424
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,960
The ones featuring Plengpin

425
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:05,000
outnumber the policy posts
by more than half.

426
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:08,800
Doesn't that contradict
what you just said?

427
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,600
As for social media…

428
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,640
I hope that from now on,

429
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,640
you'll give us your full support.

430
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,320
Very good.

431
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,800
Ratt,

432
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,840
everything is going well now.

433
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,880
No need to worry.

434
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,840
Just keep following our plan.

435
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,720
Handle the front-end work.

436
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,920
Yes, madam.

437
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,200
As for the back-end

438
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,280
and the popularity…

439
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,320
I'll take care of it myself.

440
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,880
THEY TALK A GOOD GAME,
BUT THEY'LL CHEAT IN THE END

441
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:34,000
When the person most skilled
at showing a beautiful light

442
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,960
and hiding their filthy darkness

443
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,000
is the one who gets everything…

444
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,800
- Thank you so much.
- Have a nice day.

445
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,160
…the world ends up being
driven by that truth.

446
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,720
- Hello.
- Please pick the one you want.

447
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,400
We never stop competing.

448
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,240
The more you hide, the more you win.

449
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,120
The more you win, the more you hide.

450
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,480
CREATING JOBS
FULFILLING DREAMS

451
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:04,000
Expanding the darkness over and over,
on and on without end.

452
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,760
Please vote for No. 10.

453
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,880
And what would happen

454
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:15,200
if someone were to reveal
everything that's been hidden?

455
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:17,720
Thank you.

456
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,680
A new hot topic is
quickly sweeping the nation.

457
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,600
A mysterious video clip has just been sent
to news outlets nationwide.

458
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:11,680
The clip exposes a famous actress
who recently entered politics.

459
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,600
The truth is,

460
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,640
I was once one of the deceivers too.

461
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,080
In fact,

462
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,200
I was once taught

463
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,480
that life needs a little mystery.

464
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,000
And it's true.

465
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,680
Sometimes, hiding something
might be better.

466
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,680
But maybe,

467
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,200
it's time…

468
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,720
for this cycle to finally end.

469
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,200
Sure, revealing everything to the world

470
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,960
could turn the tables.

471
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,520
It could destroy the balance.

472
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,600
But so what?

473
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,600
I've finally learned

474
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,600
that if this world crumbles,

475
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,560
we can just build a new one.

476
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,880
One where everyone understands
everything equally.

477
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,400
This exposé shows us secrets
from a competition

478
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,400
that no one's ever seen before,

479
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:17,520
most notably,
the cruel and cold-blooded actions

480
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:24,240
of a contestant long thought to be
the victim of the fire five years ago.

481
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:30,000
But in truth, she caused the whole thing.

482
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,000
Listen carefully.

483
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:37,960
What I'm about to say
may sound unbelievable.

484
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:43,920
But in this world,
there is such a thing as black magic.

485
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,080
And it's always been in the shadows.

486
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,240
- IS THIS FOR REAL?
- BUT HE'S GOT PROOF.

487
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,320
What we think is superstition

488
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,400
truly exists.

489
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,120
Including what's called

490
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,520
Enigma.

491
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:06,200
- Excuse me?
- My gosh. Hurry up.

492
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,560
Ms. Plengpin?

493
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,280
- Please give us an answer.
- Is it true?

494
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:15,480
Yes, it may sound unbelievable,
but that's the crux of it.

495
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,840
As long as you don't believe,
you'll never see it.

496
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:25,080
No, you can't.
No interviews allowed. No photos.

497
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,640
Ms. Plengpin, you're staying silent…

498
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,000
But if you look closely
at this small crack…

499
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:36,200
you'll gradually realize
you just couldn't see it,

500
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,560
but it's been with you all along.

501
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,360
No photos, please. Not allowed.

502
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,480
- Ms. Plengpin.
- Thank you.

503
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,240
- Ms. Plengpin.
- Make way, please.

504
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,280
Trust me.

505
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:11,240
Because if you believe,
it will become real.

506
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,400
And if it's real,

507
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,240
it can't deceive us anymore.
