1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,039
And that was our final contestant
for the show.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,519
JEW, MYDAY,
PLENGPIN, ANYA

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,200
<i>I told you to stay away from Anya.
Was that really so hard to understand?</i>

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,719
<i>Just quit.</i>

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,079
<i>What he's really doing
is looking for the right sorceress</i>

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,399
<i>to wear that cursed dress.</i>

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,679
<i>You said I'm just a regular person?</i>

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,999
<i>Wrong again.</i>

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,120
I'm gonna make this show
as fun as possible.

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,520
<i>One,</i>

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,839
<i>two, three,</i>

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,039
<i>four, five,</i>

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,800
<i>six, seven, eight.</i>

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,999
<i>Look.</i>

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,360
YET ANOTHER LEAKED PHOTO
SOCIALITE A IN SAME FRAME AS ANYA

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,800
That's the eighth article now
since we started dating.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,840
And I already told the reporters
there's nothing between us.

18
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,480
But the more I said it,
the deeper they dug.

19
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,840
It's kinda funny.

20
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,720
That's just human nature, isn't it?

21
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,799
You know how people are.

22
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,960
When there's a secret dangling
right in front of them,

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,120
they can't help but want to dig it up.

24
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,720
You seem a little off today.

25
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,440
Is something wrong?

26
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,960
Let's break up.

27
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,799
You're joking.

28
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,880
I'm serious.

29
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,120
Why?

30
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,200
Don't people usually break up
for a reason?

31
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,280
Nothing special.

32
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,640
I'm just bored.

33
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,240
Bored?

34
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,080
That's your reason?

35
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,680
Well, I'm sick of faking
this relationship too.

36
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,160
Sorry.

37
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,720
You really think I don't know
why you were trying to get close to me?

38
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,160
Breaking up's good
for both of us then, right?

39
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,680
I'm sick of this fake-ass game.

40
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,480
But that doesn't mean I'm sick of you.

41
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,960
I'm not one of them anymore.

42
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,160
So now that you know,
will that change anything?

43
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,840
You're no longer one of them.

44
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,000
That's why it has to end.

45
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,479
No TV.

46
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,960
Phone got confiscated.

47
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,160
This shit is boring as hell.

48
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,680
What are you whining about now?

49
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,000
What the hell's wrong with you?

50
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,519
Can't you come in like a normal person?

51
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,399
You know I can't do that.

52
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,519
Here. I brought all the data
and essential documents.

53
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,879
There's everything I could get
about the competition.

54
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,640
And a map of the CCTV cameras.
They're everywhere.

55
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,559
You can assume that the moment
you step out of this room,

56
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,159
filming starts.

57
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,759
So don't go shooting your mouth off.

58
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,119
Dude, seriously--

59
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,799
And don't talk to me unless
it's necessary. Got it?

60
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,560
Yeah, yeah. I got it.

61
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,319
One more thing.

62
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,560
What now? Why's there always more?

63
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,679
I wanted to say

64
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,440
you did very well last time.

65
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,360
Your plan really worked.

66
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,199
Is this the real Ajin or what?

67
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,320
Don't push it.

68
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,159
I'm saying that for the next round,
we need to follow the plan even better.

69
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,200
It's only gonna get tougher and riskier.

70
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,559
So, where are the things
I asked you to make?

71
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,719
These?

72
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,880
Yeah.

73
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,159
See? I follow orders like a champ.

74
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,399
Not enough. Do more. A lot more.

75
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,119
Seriously? I'm exhausted already.

76
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,080
This much should last us a month.

77
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,760
Nope.

78
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,240
Honestly?

79
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,760
Even this might not be enough
to get us through the elimination round.

80
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,000
"CHAPTER 5: MYSTICAL MATERIAL
MIRROR PERFORMANCE"

81
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,919
CHAPTER 5 POEM

82
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,959
In Chapter 5 of the novel,

83
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,959
Bu-nga begins her journey
to find a mystical material

84
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,160
for the dress as the ruler ordered.

85
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,839
Her first stop
is the Mirror Silkworm Cocoon.

86
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,399
Its thread shines beautifully
like a mirror.

87
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,760
It attracts all kinds of danger
with its exquisite reflection.

88
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,680
So this next round won't be solo.

89
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,599
You'll perform in pairs.

90
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,639
Synchronization is everything
in this challenge.

91
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:14,080
The person who mirrors her partner best
and most beautifully

92
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,280
will earn the highest score.

93
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,080
First up from Team One.

94
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,599
Plengpin.

95
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,159
BU-NGA MUEN PHAMORN

96
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,400
First up from Team Two.

97
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,360
Jew.

98
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,320
So the next name I draw
will be Plengpin's partner.

99
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,560
<i>Someone like Anya will do anything</i>

100
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,919
to be your partner next round.

101
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,400
If I had to guess,
she wants to take you out first.

102
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,119
That extreme, huh?

103
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,560
Actually...

104
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,880
it's probably me she wants to take out.

105
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,800
But either way, I'll try to find a way.

106
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,560
Anya.

107
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,800
So, Myday, you'll be with Jew.

108
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,640
Guess we ended up together after all.

109
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,599
Next, you'll all get the source footage
to study for this round.

110
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,879
Let me repeat.

111
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,999
What matters most is harmony
and emotional depth.

112
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,560
I'm expecting a perfect performance.

113
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,799
<i>And that wraps up pair selection.</i>

114
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,119
<i>Some very intriguing chemistry.</i>

115
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,319
<i>But what's even more intriguing is
how determined they all are.</i>

116
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,319
<i>No time wasted.</i>

117
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,319
<i>They're eating and workshopping
at the same time.</i>

118
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,240
- Wanna try syncing? See which way to turn.
- One, two, three.

119
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,160
Okay. Break time.

120
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,560
Hey.

121
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,479
You know how after 15 minutes of eating,

122
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,639
they stop filming, right?

123
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,760
Yeah.

124
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,200
But acting like a jackass like this
doesn't help with anything.

125
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,839
Don't you want our show to go well?

126
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,000
At least better than that other pair.

127
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,560
You want it to go well?

128
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,680
Then keep up and sync with me.

129
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,360
If you actually try, it'll turn out fine.

130
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,240
I know we're enemies.

131
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,079
But can you get your priorities straight?

132
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,600
I am. That's why I'm doing this.

133
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,959
These challenges,
all the games we're competing in,

134
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,760
they don't matter at all.

135
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,680
An enemy is still an enemy.

136
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,039
From the second I stepped into this house,
it's been a battlefield.

137
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,640
And that includes this very moment.

138
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,319
Thanks for the kindness,

139
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,680
but I'll never play nice with you.

140
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,600
What a stubborn bitch!

141
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,600
Oh?

142
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,040
You figured it out?

143
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,999
- It wasn't me!
- Film it!

144
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,159
Jew just drank the water,
and then this happened.

145
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,800
Call first aid.

146
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,480
Jew, are you okay? Can you hang on?

147
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,159
Must be food poisoning.

148
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,080
Come on. I'll take you to the bathroom.

149
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,360
Can you make it?

150
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,520
Hang in there. We're almost there.

151
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,680
Hey, what's wrong?

152
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,479
Thank you so much, Anya,

153
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,880
for taking care of me.

154
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,080
But I'm okay now.

155
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,440
I won't forget how you looked out for me.

156
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,879
Are you all right?

157
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,440
We'll take you for a checkup.

158
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,160
Oh my gosh!

159
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,239
Food poisoning?!
How is that even possible?

160
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,279
You all know
the chef I brought in is top-notch.

161
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,679
So there's no way it was food poisoning.

162
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,039
Right.

163
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,920
Honestly, even calling it that feels off.

164
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,759
If you check the footage,

165
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,880
you'll see all the contestants
ate the same thing.

166
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,199
But the symptoms...

167
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,680
They most closely resemble food poisoning.

168
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,080
So we think
the most likely scenario is that

169
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,079
someone spiked the drinking water.

170
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,400
Oh my gosh, someone spiked the water?!

171
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,880
Has anyone checked it?

172
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,840
I already did.

173
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,880
I found nothing.

174
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,000
Oh my gosh.

175
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,040
Oh my gosh. This is fabulous!

176
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,959
You. You. You.

177
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,719
You, girls, are fabulous.

178
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,679
Such strong characters. All of you.

179
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,440
You all keep my heart pounding.

180
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,440
Anyone else have anything to report?

181
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,520
Um, excuse me.

182
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,720
Don't you think we should do something?

183
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,880
Like?

184
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,560
Like maybe tighten security or something?

185
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,040
What for?

186
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,879
To catch the culprit?

187
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,919
And dim the fire
burning in these contestants?

188
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,279
Is that really worth it?

189
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,639
Besides, we already have rules.

190
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,319
Well thought-out ones.

191
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,160
We've got surveillance cameras too.

192
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,439
And still, no culprit.

193
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,600
You know why?

194
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,760
Because they're hungry.

195
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:18,040
These people give everything just
to get ahead without anyone finding out.

196
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,320
And that's acceptable.

197
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,479
That's showbiz.

198
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,519
But--

199
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,799
Our mission

200
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,840
is to find the best content
for the audience.

201
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,640
Isn't that right?

202
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,919
So bottom line is
M.L. Ray's not gonna do anything.

203
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,280
In fact, he's encouraging cheating.

204
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,960
Honestly, I'm not even surprised.

205
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,720
Yeah.

206
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,199
That just means
we have to be extra careful now,

207
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,200
I guess.

208
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,280
But that's what we planned for
anyway, right?

209
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,960
Fine by me.

210
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,200
If M.L. Ray's obsessed with
putting on a show for the audience,

211
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,079
let's give him one.

212
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,280
Let's go all out.

213
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,000
Okay, we're ready to shoot.

214
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,559
That was marvelous.

215
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,600
You two really gave it your all.

216
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:17,919
We all know you come from
different backgrounds,

217
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,559
but you managed to mirror each other
extremely well.

218
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,600
If I had to critique anything,

219
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,400
it would be Anya.

220
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,839
Your mirror was always
slightly ahead of Plengpin's.

221
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,440
It felt intentional, like you wanted her
to follow your lead the whole time.

222
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,400
I'm giving you 7 points.

223
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,439
As for Plengpin,

224
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,999
not only did you convey
the emotion so well,

225
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,759
but you carried the show through
to a beautiful finish.

226
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,280
I'm giving you 9 points.

227
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,719
Anya, anything to say?

228
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,920
No.

229
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,399
What you said was exactly right.

230
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,919
If I had to say something,
it'd be to thank Plengpin

231
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,320
for supporting the performance
from start to finish.

232
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,520
You were amazing.

233
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,120
Thank you.

234
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,480
Using stand-ins, huh?

235
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,999
I hope you keep that...

236
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,080
what do you call it...

237
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,840
that mojo all the way until the end.

238
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,320
Uh, if the next pair is ready,
bring them to standby at the set.

239
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,400
What's wrong, hotshot?
You look bummed out.

240
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,480
Nothing.

241
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,959
So, what'd you think of the last show?

242
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,520
Give me your take,

243
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,120
but don't let your personal stuff bias it.

244
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,920
Even if she's your ex,

245
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,040
your job's to stay neutral.

246
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,239
Wait... you know about me and Anya?

247
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,720
You think I don't vet my crew?

248
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,320
Don't worry, no one cares.

249
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,040
Just don't mess up the shoot
and keep it off the internet.

250
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,159
So, what do you think?

251
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,320
You agree with M.L. Ray's comments?

252
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,200
I agree with all of it.

253
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,159
But personally,

254
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,160
I think Anya's playing the long game.

255
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,920
Right now, though...

256
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,080
I'm more curious about these two.

257
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,719
Let's see what they can do--

258
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,960
Ow!

259
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,040
What's going on?

260
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,920
What happened?!

261
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,080
Looks like someone put shards of glass
inside Myday's shoe.

262
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,400
Oh my goodness...

263
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,639
Make sure to film all of this.

264
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,880
Search every locker now.

265
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,679
Jew.

266
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,759
When you were in this room,
did you see anyone acting strange?

267
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,680
No, I didn't.

268
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,359
But maybe

269
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,440
the culprit came in earlier.

270
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,880
Who the hell would be dumb enough
to keep the evidence on them?

271
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,000
Found it.

272
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,600
It's in Anya's locker.

273
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,680
Anya?

274
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,680
Anya...

275
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,799
Why would you do that to Myday?

276
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,759
Cut it out. I didn't do it.

277
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,959
What a lame setup, framing me like this.

278
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,959
Who's gonna buy it?

279
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,320
The evidence is right there,
and you're still denying it?

280
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,560
Well, this room has a CCTV camera, right?

281
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,360
May I request to see the footage?

282
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,480
Then we'll know who really did it.

283
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,879
But that's the crew's camera.

284
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,279
We...

285
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,160
- Are... are we even allowed to view it?
- Excellent idea.

286
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,640
Let's all watch it together then.

287
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,480
I allow it.

288
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,160
Got it.

289
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,079
This person really covered their tracks.

290
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,959
They knew there was a camera.

291
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,439
But let's see how far that gets them.

292
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,840
No worries. Another angle should
clearly show the person's face.

293
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,520
Switch it.

294
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,600
Clear as day.

295
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,119
You bitch.

296
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,119
- What the hell are you doing?
- Stop it!

297
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,919
- Jew, are you messing with me?
- Stop!

298
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,759
- Fine! You wanna play?
- Anya, stop!

299
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,239
You're gonna get it! You fucking snake.
Let me go!

300
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,319
Jew!

301
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,240
You get out of here!

302
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,760
Sir,

303
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,600
what should we do
about the next performance?

304
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,359
We don't have a choice.

305
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,000
Jew will have to go solo.

306
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,359
Of course.

307
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,159
I'll give it my all.

308
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,999
I'll do it for Myday too.

309
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,040
Wait!

310
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,040
I'm okay.

311
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,760
Please let me perform.

312
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,360
I'm begging you.

313
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,000
Please.

314
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,720
Myday,

315
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,720
are you absolutely sure?

316
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,000
Then let's begin.

317
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,799
Okay.

318
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,840
I was really worried about Myday.

319
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,399
Even just standing up was hard for her.

320
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,600
But I had to focus on our show first.

321
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,519
The next part was Myday's
solo performance,

322
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,360
so everyone was holding their breath.

323
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,520
<i>As soon as the show started,</i>

324
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,160
<i>honestly?</i>

325
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,400
<i>Just watching her...</i>

326
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,520
I could almost feel the pain myself.

327
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,120
Ouch!

328
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:23,760
But suddenly, I felt like
all her pain disappeared.

329
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,839
When we switched spots,

330
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,760
I felt something wet on the floor.

331
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,600
<i>In that moment, it was like everyone...</i>

332
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,480
stopped breathing.

333
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,720
Myday pulled it off.

334
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,360
I'm so happy for her.

335
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,560
Perfect. Absolutely perfect.

336
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,799
Jew, you did really well today too.

337
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,200
You get 8 points.

338
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,400
As for Myday...

339
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:43,560
there's no reason not to give you
a perfect score today.

340
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,560
This was truly your day.

341
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,559
And cut! Quick, get Myday patched up.

342
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,800
The rest of you, set up for the interviews
with the other three, now!

343
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,799
Wait!

344
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,440
What kind of magic is that?
How did she pull that off?

345
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,360
No. We'll talk later.

346
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,640
How are you feeling now?

347
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,999
They just finished wrapping my foot.

348
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,359
I'm still feeling a little dizzy.

349
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,560
And my foot...

350
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,280
Ow!

351
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,239
But don't worry!

352
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,279
I will recover as fast as I can

353
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,479
to repay everyone for their support!

354
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,680
I'll keep fighting!

355
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,440
Okay.

356
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,159
Cameras are off now, right?

357
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,159
All done.

358
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,600
And no one's out front, yeah?

359
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,760
Nope.

360
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,880
In that case,

361
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,760
crawl over here.

362
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,719
I think it's time

363
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,520
I gave a reward to the three of you.

364
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,320
Thank you so much

365
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,320
for helping me today.

366
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,960
The three of you...

367
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,200
are just the sweetest.

368
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,200
Especially you,

369
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,160
<i>for sharing such useful info.</i>

370
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,039
So sweet.

371
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:02,320
And you, for coming up with the plan

372
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,760
and even getting me that fake blood.

373
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,920
And you,

374
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,559
for bandaging me up so convincingly.

375
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,280
Well done.

376
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,400
Seriously,

377
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,040
without you all,

378
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,800
how could I even manage?

379
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,440
Thank you.

380
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,920
Oh, by the way,

381
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:46,280
you all have access to
the internet, right?

382
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,479
But... should I say it now?

383
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,600
What if someone's eavesdropping?

384
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,200
So?

385
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,400
She already sensed it.

386
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,880
Damn, her instincts are sharp.

387
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,960
So what info did we get?

388
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:19,239
At least now we know what type of magic
Jew and Myday specialize in.

389
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,840
Thankfully, it's not combat or cursing.

390
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,040
But what if they've got
the same skills as you?

391
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,400
No normal person could pull that off.

392
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,600
Only rare cases, like Anya.

393
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,920
One look and I could tell.

394
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:44,679
Still, who would've thought
someone like Anya would fall this low?

395
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,199
But the scores aren't that far apart.

396
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,718
She could still catch up.

397
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,760
It's not about the score.

398
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,760
Don't forget.

399
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:01,840
This whole contest is really about finding
out who the cursed dress will choose.

400
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,520
And I bet Anya's in trouble right now.

401
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,479
But whatever.

402
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,720
No point focusing on her.

403
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,759
Maybe worry about yourself instead.

404
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,680
Later.

405
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,360
Oh please.
You should take your own advice.

406
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,800
You're the one
who worries about her the most.

407
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,520
Not still hung up on your ex, are you?

408
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,760
No.

409
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,000
Just feeling guilty.

410
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,880
Guilty about what?

411
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,599
If Anya keeps
getting ganged up on like this,

412
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,400
then soon...

413
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,719
See?

414
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,800
Didn't even get to finish my sentence.

415
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,319
LEAKED PHOTO FROM SET
OF #BuNgaMuenPhamorn

416
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,399
WAIT, ISN'T THAT ANYA'S EX?

417
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,079
ICONIC. SLEEPING WITH THE CREW.

418
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,439
SO SHE'S BASICALLY CHEATING?

419
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,759
<i>Guys, remember the guy
who had a scandal with Anya?</i>

420
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,999
<i>Turns out he's on the crew.</i>

421
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,999
<i>And there's an insider rumor that
Anya poisoned her friend</i>

422
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,759
<i>and even put glass in her shoe.</i>

423
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,239
Girl, have you seen
what people are saying online?

424
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,879
Anya's getting dragged for cheating hard.

425
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,400
Well, she kinda deserves it.
She brought it on herself.

426
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,679
Who do you think leaked the photo?

427
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,559
- That camera angle's not from an outsider.
- Bet it was Ajin.

428
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,159
He did always have a thing
for taking pics.

429
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,319
Wild. But hey, love's complicated.

430
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,679
Maybe it was a messy breakup.

431
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,240
Yeah, that tracks.

432
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,440
HATED HER FOREVER.
#BanAnya

433
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,400
LIAR. CHEATER. TRASH.

434
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,200
BU-NGA MUEN PHAMORN

435
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,279
I WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT ANYA AND I
ARE NOT IN A RELATIONSHIP.

436
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,039
SHE DID NOT CHEAT IN THE COMPETITION.
PLEASE DELETE YOUR MESSAGES.

437
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,920
THEY ARE DAMAGING HER REPUTATION.
THANK YOU.

438
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,400
Anya.

439
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,519
Took you long enough to figure it out.

440
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,320
That much work, huh?

441
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,800
Yeah. I am working.

442
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,720
So what are you doing here?

443
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,800
Doesn't matter.

444
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,600
But since I'm here...

445
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,640
stay and have a drink with me.

446
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,840
Damn it!

447
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,000
It was just a moment...

448
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,880
just one brief moment

449
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,920
when I actually thought I was
the strongest sorcerer out of us four.

450
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,919
And the second I thought that...

451
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,440
Boom! I got played.

452
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,959
You know what got me?

453
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,679
A shapeshifting spell.

454
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,759
Myday's... what is it again?

455
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,520
Dumb charm magic, right?

456
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,919
Ugh, it's so frustrating.

457
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,000
I really underestimated them.

458
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,640
Aren't you gonna say anything?

459
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,199
I agree with all of that.

460
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,360
You were careless.

461
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,879
But I was surprised too.

462
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,879
Who would've thought

463
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,119
that putting black magic in the hands
of someone who understands showbiz

464
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,320
would mess with our heads this much?

465
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,160
But still,

466
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,800
even if they get inside your head,
you can't let it shake you.

467
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,120
You know this.

468
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,319
Do you know why Myday
leaked that story now,

469
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,480
even though the show doesn't have
public voting?

470
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:18,159
Because when a sorcerer gets emotional,

471
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,959
that's when it gets dangerous.

472
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,320
Right?

473
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,960
Yeah, I know.

474
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:39,480
You're one of the strongest sorcerers
I've ever met,

475
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,480
do you know that?

476
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,520
If you'd just stayed focused...

477
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,840
They got on my nerves, and then...

478
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,360
Ugh! Out of booze now too?!

479
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,520
Ugh! I'm so annoyed.

480
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,960
What are you smiling at?

481
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,160
Nothing. I've just never seen
this side of you before.

482
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,920
Well...

483
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,919
if you hadn't dumped me,

484
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,440
you'd have seen plenty more.

485
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,600
Let me ask you something.

486
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,160
The day you broke up with me,

487
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,080
you already knew, didn't you,
that our relationship...

488
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:05,840
would screw things up for me
in this <i>Bu-nga Muen Phamorn</i> contest.

489
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:23,560
Well... back when we were dating,

490
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,480
did you ever feel anything?

491
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,240
You're asking too many questions now.

492
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,840
Don't even try it. Just answer me.

493
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,240
- Why do you even want to know?
- What, I'm not allowed to?

494
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,239
What's the point now?

495
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,800
Knowing doesn't change anything.

496
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,320
I guess it doesn't matter.

497
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,600
I've made my decision.

498
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,360
Which is?

499
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,280
I'm going to help you.

500
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,319
I'll help Plengpin win

501
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,960
so you can get the Bu-nga dress.

502
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,840
- You mean it?
- Don't get cocky.

503
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,679
I'm only doing this

504
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,240
because I know my odds of winning
are dropping fast.

505
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,760
But whatever.

506
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,000
Better you get it than one of them.

507
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,960
Thank you.

508
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,040
But don't let your guard down.

509
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,680
What we need to do now is
share any info we've got with each other.

510
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,720
Clear?

511
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,200
Got it.

512
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,439
I'll gather everything I can
on Jew and Myday.

513
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,640
Then, in one hour,

514
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,600
let's meet in the costume showcase room.

515
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,360
I've got something to show you.

516
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:42,760
Sounds good.

517
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,320
Hey.

518
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,520
Now that we've shaken on this,

519
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,200
don't you dare do a boring-ass show.

520
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,480
Help!

521
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,800
Let go!

522
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,680
Help me!

523
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,320
Hey, was that Anya screaming?!

524
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,680
Please, I give in.

525
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,240
I'm gonna quit!

526
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,720
...quit.

527
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,319
<i>In this mansion...</i>

528
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,239
I guess nowhere's safe anymore.

529
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:42,000
Given the situation, I've decided
the competition will continue.

530
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,559
<i>Everyone here's completely insane.
I can't take it anymore.</i>

531
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:50,240
<i>Let's all try not to die, okay?</i>

532
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,640
It's been a while, hasn't it, Ajin?
