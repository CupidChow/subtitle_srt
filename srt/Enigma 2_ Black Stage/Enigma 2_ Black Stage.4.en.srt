1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,640
<i>You were already given a clean exit,</i>

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,600
<i>but you were dumb enough to come back.</i>

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,680
You gave one hell of a performance.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,880
From this moment on,

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,720
I'm taking complete control
of this production.

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,920

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,000
Okay. But before I show you
the results of my research,

10
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,200
can you promise me something?

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,960
You have to keep this a secret,
and you absolutely can't tell anyone.

12
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,840
Do you promise?

13
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,840
But why does it have to be a secret?

14
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:53,320
Well… sometimes,
life needs a little mystery.

15
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,960
That's what makes it exciting.

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,920
Come on.

17
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,760
Promise me, okay?

18
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,480
Okay.

19
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,200
All right, are you ready
for Dad's super-secret show?

20
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,440
<i>Previously, all three contestants</i>

21
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,480
<i>were neck and neck in the search for</i>
<i>the orchids hidden in the mansion.</i>

22
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,800
<i>It really came down to the wire.</i>

23
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,120
<i>But just as time was running out,</i>
<i>something unexpected happened.</i>

24
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,320
At first, I was sure I was going to win.

25
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,360
JEW

26
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,280
But…

27
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,840
<i>Unbelievably, someone actually found</i>
<i>the special orchid</i>

28
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,200
<i>that the show team hid</i>
<i>at the bottom of the mansion's pool.</i>

29
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,080
<i>That someone was Plengpin.</i>

30
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,120
<i>She got the bonus points</i>
<i>and won this round instantly.</i>

31
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,440
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what made me jump in, honestly.</i>

32
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,360
But when I found that flower underwater,
I was so happy.

33
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,240
PLENGPIN

34
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,000
Lucky I survived!

35
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,400
<i>But her unexpected courage meant that</i>

36
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,080
<i>we had to postpone</i>
<i>the final round just a bit</i>

37
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,600
<i>to make sure she was ready.</i>

38
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,720
<i>After a long journey,</i>
<i>through challenges and growth,</i>

39
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,920
<i>we're finally about to find out</i>

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,640
<i>who will be the lead</i>
<i>of </i>Bu-nga Muen Phamorn

41
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,080
<i>and earn that prestigious honor.</i>

42
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,320
<i>The answer is waiting in this final round.</i>

43
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,280
BU-NGA MUEN PHAMORN

44
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,000
Oh, fabulous.

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,200
So smooth, totally seamless.

46
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,160
As the new producer,
I have to hand it to everyone.

47
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,040
So that means you're not going to
make any more changes?

48
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,560
Can I give a quick note?

49
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,880
I think the opening drags a bit.

50
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,360
Also, the part about postponing the final?

51
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,440
Let's cut that. It's too long.

52
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,800
And edit the ending montage.

53
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,040
You were too rushed
in picking the footage.

54
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,520
I'd like it to be a bit more polished.

55
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,360
Oh, and you can't leave out
the contestants who got eliminated.

56
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,560
Go get an interview with Myday.

57
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,120
What? Is there a problem?

58
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,120
Well…

59
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,560
We checked and, um, Myday…

60
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,360
Idiot!

61
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,080
<i>- She's not ready for an interview.</i>
- I didn't cheat!

62
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,120
I get it.

63
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,280
Must be heartbreaking.

64
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,640
But that's not my problem.

65
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,240
So find a way to make it happen.

66
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,040
Here are the details
for the final round tomorrow.

67
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,040
There are some references
I want you to add.

68
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,480
Get it done by tonight.

69
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,480
And here's the brief for the contestants.

70
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,480
Pass it on.

71
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,320
INT. MD, INTRO DRAGS, CUT PPD

72
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,200
Why are you spacing out?

73
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,800
You don't like the cut?

74
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,560
No, it's even more dramatic
than I expected. It's just…

75
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,720
Just what?

76
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,960
I thought you'd be way angrier
at me and Plengpin.

77
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,120
Oh, that.

78
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,440
Of course I'm angry.

79
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,880
But I don't have time for that.

80
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,840
In our line of work, the show must go on.

81
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,280
What I need from you is your commitment
to deliver the best show possible.

82
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,280
Don't let me down.

83
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,360
The rest…

84
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,840
Lift together, slowly.

85
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,800
One, two…

86
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,040
Leave it to me.

87
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,520
Just make sure everything is perfect
by tomorrow.

88
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,880
And tell housekeeping
to stop feeding the fish.

89
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,720
They're going to get too fat!

90
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,760
BU-NGA MUEN PHAMORN

91
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,880
If you have any questions, just ask.

92
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,120
Thank you.

93
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,400
Oh, Myday, you haven't packed yet?

94
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,760
Glad I ran into you.

95
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,960
I never got to say a proper goodbye.

96
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,040
Drop the act.

97
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,000
If you hadn't cheated
and pretended to be me,

98
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,920
you think you'd have beaten me?

99
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Give up your spot to me now!

100
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,040
Hold on. Who are you
to call bullshit on anyone?

101
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,800
You're the biggest bullshitter of all!

102
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,720
Huh?

103
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,600
Oh, did I cheat? Did I?

104
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,680
Did I cheat?

105
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,760
What rule says I can't do
what I did? None.

106
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,400
Or is all this because you always
live off your lackeys,

107
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,800
so your brain's turned to mush?

108
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,640
- Jew!
- Please, no!

109
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,400
There are cameras.

110
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,120
Seriously,

111
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,200
being a bullshitter like you is kinda fun.

112
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,400
Thanks,

113
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,120
loser!

114
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,800
I can't take this anymore!

115
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,680
- Myday!
- I can't stand it!

116
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,280
- Get out.
- Help!

117
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,920
- Help! Help!
- Myday!

118
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,200
- Myday!
- Die!

119
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,200
Just die!

120
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,080
What the hell are you two doing?

121
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,600
Madam! I didn't do anything, madam!

122
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,520
It wasn't me!

123
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,560
Someone was going to hurt Jew, so I…

124
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,880
Madam.

125
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,280
Madam, help me, please!

126
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,720
This is too much.

127
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,040
Your transformation spell
probably can't hold up.

128
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,000
No! Madam, believe me!

129
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,480
My spell still works!

130
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,560
You have to help me!

131
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,960
Don't leave me!

132
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,680
How am I supposed to survive?

133
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,800
I'll do anything!

134
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,080
I'll do anything to get my old face back!

135
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,440
Please, help me!

136
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,720
Don't leave me. I have nothing left.

137
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,680
If that's the case,
then there's nothing I can do.

138
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,560
Madam!

139
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,800
Jew.

140
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:11,280
You said you'd do anything, right?

141
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,120
Don't let me down.

142
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,360
As for you,
you failed me in the last show.

143
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,600
You think I'd give you another chance?

144
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,840
The only thing you can do now

145
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,600
is make sure your friend
becomes the winner

146
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,080
in the most beautiful way possible.

147
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,080
Counting on you, Myday.

148
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,160
Can I see the photos you took?

149
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,520
How?

150
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,680
It's a film camera.

151
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,880
Here.

152
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,800
The brief for the final round.

153
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,400
Thanks.

154
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,320
What's wrong? Nervous?

155
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,760
Can you blame me?

156
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
There's nothing to stress about.

157
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,400
Just give it your best shot, like always.

158
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,520
Plengpin, even though I don't say it much,

159
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,680
you've always done great.

160
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:01,320
Everything that's made you
who you are today is perfect.

161
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,720
Everything.

162
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,720
Even the things you don't want to admit,
like your family.

163
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,080
What do you mean?

164
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,720
Your client made the first move.
He grabbed me!

165
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,480
<i>I know that growing up in a shaman family</i>
<i>in a small rural village</i>

166
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,200
<i>is something you've always tried</i>
<i>to run from.</i>

167
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,960
<i>But you know what?</i>

168
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,160
That's exactly why I chose you.

169
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,600
It's rare these days.

170
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,160
Why bring this up now?

171
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,400
Just feels like
it's finally time to tell you.

172
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,520
Really?

173
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,640
Then can I ask you a little more?

174
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,320
There's a lot you haven't told me, right?

175
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,320
That's enough.
Just that one story will do.

176
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,840
Hey! Why so shy now?

177
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,840
When you were interviewing me on the show,
you asked a million questions,

178
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,480
and I never complained.

179
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,000
All right.

180
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,440
Fine.

181
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,080
You get one more question.

182
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,400
But you have to promise
you won't stress about it. Okay?

183
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,520
In that case…

184
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,360
I'd like to start the interview now.

185
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,720
Three, two, one…

186
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,880
AJIN NAKARUTHA

187
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,120
So, you got a question?

188
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,720
I'll give you only one.

189
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,600
In that case,

190
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,760
tell me about your past.

191
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,920
I want to know what brought you here.

192
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,040
It's a long story.

193
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,000
I don't mind.

194
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,120
Did you know?

195
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,040
There used to be a group of researchers

196
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,800
trying to study Thai magic with science.

197
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,280
<i>They wondered if it was possible</i>

198
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,720
<i>that all that mysterious power</i>
<i>could be decoded somehow.</i>

199
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,320
LEKLAI STONE

200
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,400
Listen, Ajin.

201
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,760
This is a Leklai stone.

202
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,320
It's a sacred element,
said to protect and guard people.

203
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:12,000
Normally, you need honey, heat,
and a bunch of rituals to activate it.

204
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,840
But this morning,

205
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:21,760
I discovered if you blast it
with a frequency above 10 kHz, it…

206
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,720
Slow down, Dad! I can't follow.

207
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,120
Oh, sorry.

208
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,120
I'll just show you instead.

209
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,840
Okay.

210
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:44,240
But before I show you
the results of my research,

211
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,560
can you promise me something?

212
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,600
You have to keep this a secret,
and you absolutely can't tell anyone.

213
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,800
But why does it have to be a secret?

214
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,800
Well… sometimes,
life needs a little mystery.

215
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,080
That's what makes it exciting.

216
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,720
Come on.

217
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,720
Promise me, okay?

218
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,839
Okay.

219
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,680
<i>That man's name was Anan.</i>

220
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,119
<i>He led the research team.</i>

221
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,760
He was also my father.

222
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:29,800
All right, are you ready
for Dad's super-secret show?

223
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,640
What are you two up to? Another secret?

224
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,000
Ajin, tell your aunties
what you're doing this time.

225
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,920
Nothing! We're not doing anything,
right, Ajin?

226
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,640
<i>Even though they were just a small team</i>
<i>with nothing to show for it,</i>

227
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:57,440
the time I spent with them
was the happiest time of my life.

228
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,200
<i>They were like family,</i>

229
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,760
<i>especially Aunt Ko.</i>

230
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,720
Aunt Ko…

231
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,280
You mean Madam Kosum?

232
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,520
Yes.

233
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:24,400
<i>Back then, she was a smart, kind,</i>
<i>and dedicated scientist.</i>

234
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:31,520
<i>Their main job was researching artifacts</i>
<i>from all over Thailand.</i>

235
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,360
PORAMANTIWA MANOR

236
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,400
<i>Eventually, they got special permission</i>

237
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,320
<i>to collect data on</i>
<i>the Bu-nga Muen Phamorn dress,</i>

238
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,480
<i>preserved by M.L. Ray's family.</i>

239
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,000
<i>I didn't know much then.</i>

240
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,040
<i>Just that it was a top-secret project,</i>

241
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,640
<i>and my dad and his team</i>
<i>gave it everything they had.</i>

242
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,400
<i>Especially Aunt Ko.</i>

243
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,320
But in the end,

244
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,520
<i>that journey was in vain.</i>

245
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,560
<i>Like Dad always said,</i>

246
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,720
<i>don't get obsessed, especially with magic.</i>

247
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:25,160
<i>The more obsessed you get,</i>
<i>the more it changes you.</i>

248
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,440
What are you people talking about?! Huh?

249
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:32,720
You want to drop the Bu-nga project
and go research something else

250
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,160
when we're this close to success?

251
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,320
Close?

252
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,800
Close to what, huh?

253
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,480
You've seen all the data
over these past few months.

254
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,480
We're scientists, Ko.

255
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,720
Instinct alone isn't enough.

256
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,120
I told you, I'm not just using instinct!

257
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,320
Anan, listen to me!

258
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,440
I really can connect with God.

259
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,360
What are you doing?

260
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,120
This has gone too far, Ko.

261
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,080
Take a break.
We're shutting this project down.

262
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,240
You can't do that! We're so close!

263
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,240
You're working for God.
You'll be punished.

264
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,160
Let go!

265
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,920
<i>Aunt Ko back then…</i>
<i>she was a totally different person.</i>

266
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,280
And that night…

267
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,960
What are you doing up so late, dear?

268
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,720
Are you a bad kid?

269
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:33,240
Bad kids get punished.

270
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,520
Run, Ajin!

271
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,880
I said run, Ajin!

272
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,160
Ajin!

273
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,920
Dad, no!

274
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,240
That night, Aunt Ko burned everything

275
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,600
and disappeared.

276
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,960
She stole everything from the lab.

277
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,000
MYSTERIOUS FIRE IN LAB

278
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:37,480
<i>All the data, all the artifacts,</i>
<i>she took them all.</i>

279
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,600
So…

280
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,520
how did you survive?

281
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,040
Aunt Ko took everything…

282
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,000
Hey, fire! Everybody, get out now!

283
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,440
<i>…except for one thing.</i>

284
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,520
<i>After all my dad's effort,</i>

285
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,520
<i>after so many failures,</i>

286
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,880
<i>there was finally one thing</i>

287
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,960
<i>a scientist like him managed to decode.</i>

288
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,800
<i>It was beautiful.</i>

289
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:30,360
<i>The most beautiful</i>
<i>and most painful thing in my life.</i>

290
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,360
Live on, Ajin.

291
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,560
Just keep living…

292
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,080
Keep living, Ajin.

293
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,000
And now…

294
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,280
where's that piece of Leklai?

295
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,960
<i>I left it with my father's ashes.</i>

296
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,280
That's a shame.

297
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,720
After that, not much happened.

298
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:40,280
Years later, I heard about
a famous sorceress called Kosum.

299
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,760
<i>Around the same time, news about Enigma</i>
<i>started showing up online.</i>

300
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,480
I didn't think that was a coincidence.

301
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,080
Everything was connected.

302
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,920
That's how I ended up here.

303
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,080
Okay?

304
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,720
With that…

305
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,720
Cut!

306
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,760
Thanks so much for telling me all this.

307
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,000
You're not worried anymore, right?

308
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,480
All right.

309
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,360
Let's focus on the final round.

310
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,440
Let's finish this together.

311
00:27:59,080 --> 00:27:59,920
<i>So…</i>

312
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,760
MYDAY

313
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,160
The final round's almost here.

314
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,560
<i>Even though I didn't make it,</i>

315
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:16,040
I want to wish everyone luck.

316
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:23,520
<i>Jew, Plengpin, and all the crew.</i>

317
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:28,960
<i>I'm really impressed</i>
<i>by everyone's dedication,</i>

318
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,600
especially Jew,

319
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,360
<i>my closest friend.</i>

320
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:43,080
<i>I believe someone like Jew,</i>
<i>when she sets her mind to something,</i>

321
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,200
<i>can do literally anything.</i>

322
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:54,600
And… to everyone watching,

323
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,280
please cheer them on.

324
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,120
<i>Bye!</i>

325
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,200
<i>All right.</i>

326
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,320
Let's make this…

327
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,760
<i>the most beautiful competition ever.</i>

328
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,440
POETRY FROM THE NOVEL

329
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,480
<i>In the final part of the novel,</i>

330
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,560
<i>Bu-nga drinks the Nivarana Marana potion,</i>

331
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,560
<i>sending her spirit to</i>
<i>a dangerous afterlife realm</i>

332
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,920
<i>to rescue the king's soul,</i>
<i>lost in its darkest abyss.</i>

333
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:59,680
This decision leads to a violent, tragic,

334
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,360
yet beautiful finale.

335
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,640
Plengpin,

336
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,760
Jew,

337
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,560
you've both done great.

338
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:18,400
To me, you're both perfect as Bu-nga.

339
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:22,760
But there can only be one winner.

340
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,760
I ask you both to do your best.

341
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,240
The will of <i>Bu-nga Muen Phamorn</i>

342
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,040
will guide you both to victory.

343
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,720
If you're ready, let's begin.

344
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,120
Nice to meet you, Plengpin.

345
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,480
Maybe it's a bit too soon,

346
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,640
but I'm ending your show here.

347
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,440
<i>The mountain of stones</i>

348
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,120
<i>The path of the sun</i>

349
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,920
<i>The sapphire bee</i>

350
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,200
<i>Lurking and hidden out of sight</i>

351
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,120
Mind swap?

352
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,760
You think that'll help?

353
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,360
No!

354
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,720
This is not happening!

355
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,480
I can't lose like this!

356
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,640
This can't be true!

357
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,840
Drop the act.

358
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,560
You really think I don't know?

359
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,400
Oh? You saw through it?

360
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,480
Keep trying.

361
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,680
Keep struggling.

362
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,680
<i>A catastrophe swiftly strikes</i>

363
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,400
<i>A labyrinth of death</i>

364
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,440
<i>A single misstep brings about a plight</i>

365
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,920
Deep down, you know

366
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,320
you can't beat the power of God.

367
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,400
You must die.

368
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,680
Die!

369
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,440
God will punish you with death,
just like your father!

370
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,440
Wait, stop! Don't--

371
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,000
My dad died because of "God's punishment"?

372
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,600
Give me a break.

373
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,560
He didn't die because of God.

374
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,840
He died because of scum like you!

375
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,720
Really?

376
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,000
<i>A barrier across the heavens</i>

377
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,440
<i>Deceiving with self-interest</i>

378
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,240
<i>Enticing ambition to soar</i>

379
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,400
So Anan died because of me?

380
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,400
Maybe you got it wrong.

381
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,520
The person who got
your dad killed was you.

382
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,360
If you'd just run away that day,

383
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,640
he wouldn't have died.

384
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,040
Why? Why? Why?

385
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,880
The one who killed Anan was you, Ajin.

386
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:20,120
You're the reason your life's in ruins.
You ruined everything.

387
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,120
That's not all.

388
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,640
Today, Plengpin has to die
because of you too.

389
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,120
<i>The moon devours blood</i>

390
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,080
<i>Dark and dim, its rays mourn</i>

391
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,560
<i>An eclipse descends</i>

392
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,760
<i>All omens are laid out</i>

393
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,120
Hey!

394
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,320
Why?

395
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,400
Ajin.

396
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,960
It's okay.

397
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,960
It's okay now, son.

398
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,080
<i>Like mental factors</i>

399
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,840
<i>The heart trembles and shivers</i>

400
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,080
<i>Aspiration shifts</i>

401
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,000
<i>Thoughts wander, hard to gauge</i>

402
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,240
Enough, Ajin.

403
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,000
You know us fighting here…

404
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,920
is pointless.

405
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,240
<i>Purging the land of life lost</i>

406
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,840
<i>Sacrificing fate as an offering</i>

407
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,960
<i>Wails pour forth</i>

408
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,800
<i>Sharp pain of defeat</i>

409
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,040
<i>Blood stains red</i>

410
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,480
<i>Deeply piercing the heart</i>

411
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:44,840
Let's spend these last moments
enjoying watching the show.

412
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,480
<i>Chains of the divine</i>

413
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:59,280
Released and freed from bondage

414
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,240
A front-row seat, just for you.

415
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,200
Watch closely, Ajin.

416
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,200
It will be perfect.

417
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,120
No.

418
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,720
No!

419
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,520
No!

420
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:39,880
Nothing I've done would matter.

421
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,120
I could make the most beautiful dress,

422
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,440
but it wouldn't bring happiness to anyone…

423
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,000
because our hearts

424
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,080
have nothing to hold onto.

425
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:33,400
If this little soul could be traded
for everything that's been lost,

426
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,560
it would be worth it.

427
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,880
Please, come back.

428
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,400
Bring peace,

429
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,880
bring smiles to the people

430
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,760
both now…

431
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,240
and forever.

432
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,280
You really are my student.

433
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,000
Honestly, I don't have to do anything.

434
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,800
But fine, I'll annihilate you.

435
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,320
It's all right, Ajin.

436
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,280
Soon, we'll be together.

437
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,640
I'm sorry, Dad.

438
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,680
Go for it.

439
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,160
What do you think you're doing?

440
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,120
You really think I'd help?

441
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,480
You never do anything useful.

442
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,480
All you ever do is oppress people…

443
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,840
and now you want help?

444
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,560
No way!

445
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,080
If you want happiness in this world,

446
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,240
I'll make it happen.

447
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,080
Not because anyone told me to…

448
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:20,000
but because it's from my heart.

449
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,640
And that's the real power.

450
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,440
Nothing's stronger than this heart.

451
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,960
This pure heart of mine.

452
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,160
May this power turn blood in the sky…

453
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,920
into stardust instead,

454
00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:01,600
and fill everyone's heart with hope.

455
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,400
Even if no one cares…

456
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,960
I don't mind.

457
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:47,800
From now on,

458
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,480
may you only be filled with happiness.

459
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:28,720
You!

460
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,760
What are you doing?

461
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:34,480
You really think you can beat me
with something insane like that?

462
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,040
Die.

463
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,560
<i>Accept the truth.</i>

464
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,320
You know who won this show.

465
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,080
No.

466
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:04,360
No.

467
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,200
No.

468
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,720
Put that image up on the screen.

469
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,400
Come on, hurry!

470
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,640
No.

471
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,560
And finally, our winner…

472
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,840
No!

473
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,520
…is Plengpin!

474
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,480
Give her a big hand!

475
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,160
No. No!

476
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:40,680
No.

477
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,200
No!

478
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,240
No!

479
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,760
It can't end like this!

480
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,320
Beautiful.

481
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:13,240
WHO IS THE WINNER
OF BU-NGA MUEN PHAMORN?

482
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,560
WHO IS THE WINNER
OF BU-NGA MUEN PHAMORN?

483
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,240
- GOTTA BE JEW.
- I THINK MYDAY'S BEST.

484
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,520
- I KNOW, BUT WON'T TELL.
- PLENGPIN.

485
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:19,440
SO EXCITING!

486
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,600
TOMORROW, WE'LL KNOW WHO THE WINNER
OF BU-NGA MUEN PHAMORN IS.

487
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,200
Hey.

488
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:11,080
Sneaking in while someone else
is showering…

489
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,000
That's pretty rude, you know.

490
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:15,520
Sure.

491
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:17,840
As if you're totally naked.

492
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,560
Are you okay?

493
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,440
Don't worry about me.

494
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,760
What about you?

495
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:34,640
Are you ready for tomorrow?

496
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:40,400
Starting tomorrow,
your life's going to change completely.

497
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,440
It's kinda sad, honestly.

498
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,320
I finally get to be the lead actress.

499
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,360
You're finally close to the dress.

500
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,000
Later, we'll go our separate ways,
like we agreed.

501
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,720
We're not going to see
each other again, are we?

502
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:13,400
I don't know.

503
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,480
You say that, but you know the answer.

504
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:20,200
Hey, I really don't know.

505
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,760
Thank you, Ajin.

506
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,680
Thanks for everything.

507
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:44,720
Thank you too.

508
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,320
Hey. Try acting like
a real actress now, will you?

509
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,160
Okay. Sure.

510
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:37,440
Wow, look at you taking the lead now.

511
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,080
Well, let's see.

512
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,680
Ms. Plengpin?

513
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:18,680
Yes?

514
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,000
Please get changed in ten minutes.

515
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:22,520
Okay.

516
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,960
<i>Do you think in a world full of lights…</i>

517
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,480
<i>…how much darkness is there</i>
<i>lurking inside?</i>

518
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:21,680
Ajin!

519
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,600
Jew, you lost. It's over.

520
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,560
But I didn't want it to end like this.

521
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:30,000
At least I finally got to see
the ending I always wanted.
