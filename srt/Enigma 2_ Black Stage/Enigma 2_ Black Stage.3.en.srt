1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,839
I'll help Plengpin win.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,680
<i>Let's meet in the costume showcase room.
I've got something to show you.</i>

3
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,199
No, Anya! Hang in there!

4
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,599
Whoa! Her head's totally twisted!

5
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,200
What are you even hoping for?!

6
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,599
What, is no one gonna do anything?!

7
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,119
Should we call the cops?!

8
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,159
Quick! Call the cops!

9
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,920
Don't call the police.

10
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,319
No one calls the police. Period.

11
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,879
Crew, take everyone
who isn't involved to their room.

12
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,960
The rest, check the CCTV footage
from every angle.

13
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,279
Are you out of your mind? Why the hell
won't you let us call the cops?!

14
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,439
Hey! Is no one gonna do anything?

15
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,839
Hey! Someone just died!

16
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,599
Don't you people even care?!

17
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,679
Call the police already!

18
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,360
A person just died, damn it!

19
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,120
Walking around alone at a time like this?

20
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,080
Never mind though.

21
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,080
I guess nowhere's safe anymore.

22
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,000
Hey!

23
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,600
Ajin, what the hell is going on?

24
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,200
You said Anya was a powerful sorceress,
didn't you?

25
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,000
And now she's just gone, just like that?

26
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,880
You asked me why I wanted access to
the <i>Bu-nga Muen Phamorn</i> dress, right?

27
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,000
I've been looking for a certain group.

28
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,920
And based on what I've found,
it's likely they're after the dress too.

29
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,360
What does that have to do
with any of this?

30
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,560
This is Madam Kosum.

31
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,680
She's one of the most dangerous people
I've ever known.

32
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,320
And now I'm sure of it.

33
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:31,520
<i>Someone in this mansion
is working for her.</i>

34
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,520
<i>They're hiding among us.</i>

35
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,080
Ajin.

36
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,920
What's up, hotshot?

37
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,560
Can't sleep either?

38
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,520
Do you need something?

39
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,160
M.L. Ray's calling everyone
to the stage zone.

40
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:28,359
I've reviewed all the CCTV footage
from last night,

41
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,920
and here's what I found.

42
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,520
The cameras only caught Anya carrying
her documents out of her room.

43
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,480
After that, none of the cameras
captured anything suspicious.

44
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,760
Ajin, this Madam Kosum...

45
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,120
Is she really that dangerous?

46
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,800
So... what do we do now?

47
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,440
We just have to find out
who the disciple is that she sent in.

48
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,200
For now, we just have to watch.

49
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,680
<i>See who starts acting weird.</i>

50
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,440
All right, stop right here.

51
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,600
Drop it right here.

52
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,840
Given the situation, I've decided...

53
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,280
the competition will continue.

54
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,039
Please act as if everything is normal.

55
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,959
Carry on like nothing happened.

56
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,200
Wait, what about Anya?

57
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,080
No one's going to do anything?

58
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,960
Don't worry about that.

59
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,599
<i>Three, two, and we're rolling.</i>

60
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:02,240
<i>I've decided to withdraw
from the competition.</i>

61
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,080
<i>My health hasn't been great lately.</i>

62
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,280
<i>I don't want to burden the crew
or the other finalists.</i>

63
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,720
<i>I'm really sorry to all the fans
who've been supporting me.</i>

64
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,320
Where did you get this footage?

65
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,240
Shot it on day one.

66
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,599
What you all need to know is this.

67
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:33,038
Anya suddenly withdrew from the show.
Then she vanished.

68
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,399
I'll take care of everything else.

69
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,760
But Anya's dead.

70
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,440
I know.

71
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,600
But you know how it works.

72
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,040
In this industry,
no one cares about the truth.

73
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,680
What matters is
what we want the audience to see.

74
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,160
Seriously.

75
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,320
Until now, I've never cared
how unhinged or crazy you've been.

76
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:10,519
But if you're using your ego to force
the rest of us to cover up the evidence

77
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,959
and keep competing like nothing happened,

78
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,440
there's no way I'm going along with it.

79
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,520
Cover what up? What evidence?

80
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,719
Didn't I just say
the cameras didn't catch anything?

81
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,240
So what evidence is there?

82
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,279
And listen up, everyone. Listen carefully.

83
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,280
I'm not shutting this production down.
Everything will continue as normal.

84
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,199
What was that you said just now?

85
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,080
"Forcing"? Who's forcing anyone?

86
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,959
We're not locked inside a sealed mansion.

87
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,959
There's no storm. No landslide.

88
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,839
The bridge didn't collapse, did it?

89
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,799
So if anyone wants to quit,
go ahead and leave.

90
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,119
I'm not stopping you.

91
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,839
But remember this.

92
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:54,599
If you walk away now, everything
you've worked for in life will be lost.

93
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,399
Your chance at stardom?
Your lifelong dream?

94
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,120
They'll be gone just like that.
Is that what you want?

95
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,520
So, who's still in? Raise your hand.

96
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,960
<i>What's wrong?</i>

97
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,800
Honestly?

98
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,120
You said to keep an eye on
anyone acting weird, right?

99
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,280
But just being able to stay
in this house until now

100
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,360
<i>already says that none of us
are normal anymore.</i>

101
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,240
I've fought so hard to get here.

102
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,520
I don't want to give up.

103
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,280
And you?

104
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,280
All right then.

105
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,600
Go get ready.

106
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,560
Oh, and let's all try not to die, okay?

107
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,760
We're already short on people.
I wouldn't want the show to get boring.

108
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,840
This way, please.

109
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,840
- What are you doing?
- Holy shit!

110
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,280
I thought you were someone else.

111
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,320
I was just packing to leave.

112
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,279
Everyone here's completely insane.

113
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,680
I can't take it anymore.

114
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,160
What about you? Wanna come?

115
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,159
You can't just suddenly walk away
from the show.

116
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,480
What about the killer?

117
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,000
- We still haven't found them.
- Screw it!

118
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,079
I'm not a cop.

119
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,760
Why should I care who the killer is?

120
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,000
There's a delivery truck
coming in two days.

121
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,159
I've already told them to bring
an empty one too.

122
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,640
It's big. It'll fit a few people.

123
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,919
You can ask others to come too
if you want.

124
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,080
Are you in?

125
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,800
Never mind. Think it over.

126
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,680
But while you're still here, act normal.

127
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,160
Think it through.

128
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,760
I don't know why you came here,

129
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,000
but for me,

130
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,640
life matters most.

131
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,120
Is your reason
worth risking your life for?

132
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,799
<i>To break through the ceiling
of your acting,</i>

133
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,279
<i>you must do more than just
understand the assignment.</i>

134
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:21,280
<i>You must dig deep,
to the very core of your soul.</i>

135
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,200
<i>Inhale.</i>

136
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,520
<i>Be one with yourself.</i>

137
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,439
Feel every step you're experiencing.

138
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,920
Geez, this is insane.

139
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,960
Someone literally just died.

140
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,359
If it were me,

141
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,160
just thinking how someone in there
might be the killer,

142
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,040
I'd be too freaked out
to do any of this exercise crap.

143
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,720
I think they know.

144
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,120
<i>Being surrounded by
this many cameras and crew...</i>

145
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,120
This might actually be the safest place.

146
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,400
<i>Lie down.</i>

147
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,319
Focus on your breathing.

148
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,480
Feel your inhale and exhale.

149
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,280
The ground beneath you is now a meadow.

150
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,520
You smell flowers.

151
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,879
You feel the coolness of the soil.

152
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:36,120
You feel the breeze
brushing against your skin.

153
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,000
Sit up slowly.

154
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,239
You look toward the meadow.

155
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,120
The green soothes your eyes.

156
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,799
And in the distance,
someone's walking toward you.

157
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,720
<i>They're so far away.</i>

158
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,920
But you start to make out their shape.

159
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,640
<i>From a silhouette to a face.</i>

160
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,360
<i>You see them clearly now.</i>

161
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,080
<i>You see their face.
It's the person you love the most.</i>

162
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,079
You see their smile.

163
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,400
They wave at you.

164
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,640
You feel their love.

165
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,640
The warmth they give you.

166
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:35,000
That joy of seeing them in front of you
lives on your skin.

167
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,000
You feel your skin tremble.

168
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,520
It's the feeling of love.

169
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,760
But suddenly...

170
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,880
their expression changes.

171
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,160
A stranger approaches.
They're staring down your loved one.

172
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,079
What are you feeling?

173
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,999
You're breathing fast.

174
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,760
Suddenly, the stranger lunges,

175
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,720
grabbing them by the hair.

176
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,999
He pins them down.

177
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,959
Your loved one is begging for help.

178
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,358
But you just stand there.

179
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,719
They scream, but nothing comes out.

180
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,679
You watch as they struggle
in the stranger's grip.

181
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,759
He's got a stick. He hits them.

182
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,239
Again and again! Harder each time.

183
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,119
You want to help,
but you can't reach them.

184
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,519
Scream out. Scream out.

185
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,519
Call out to them.

186
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,679
All you can do is reach.

187
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,839
You reach for them.

188
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,600
Scream. Scream. Let it out.

189
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,840
This is the last time you'll ever
get to speak to them.

190
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,120
Tell them what you need to say. Tell them.

191
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,359
Scream it out. Scream it out.

192
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,999
Wow! That last session
was really something.

193
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,119
It felt like
I unlocked something deep inside.

194
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,839
Thank you so much, M.L. Ray.

195
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:57,320
<i>That relaxation exercise was amazing.
It really moved me.</i>

196
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,800
Relaxation, my ass.

197
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,440
Uh... if the last person's done,
please return to your rooms.

198
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,000
So, hotshot. Did you make up your mind?

199
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,280
I've decided.

200
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,880
I'm staying.

201
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,240
You're not scared of dying?

202
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,880
You don't need to worry about me.

203
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,879
I'll make sure I stay safe.

204
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,600
Thanks for offering.

205
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,600
Fair enough.

206
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,080
Back in my day, I was just like you.

207
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,040
But aren't you worried about Plengpin?

208
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,480
She's the last person
I need to worry about.

209
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,600
<i>She can take care of herself
better than you think.</i>

210
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,720
Really? Well then, stay safe.

211
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,520
I'll prep the remaining documents.

212
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,239
But it's kinda weird though.

213
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,680
You suddenly... brought up Plengpin.

214
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,920
It's like you knew.

215
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,080
You knew she and I were working together.

216
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,080
You killed Anya, didn't you?

217
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,080
You're with Enigma, right?

218
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,360
Ask the person behind you.

219
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,880
It's been a while, hasn't it, Ajin?

220
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,800
Oh my.

221
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,839
We haven't seen each other in years,

222
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,200
and now you're
this hot-headed little punk?

223
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,800
A kid should know
how to respect their elders.

224
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,520
Otherwise, they get punished.

225
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,720
Got it, dear nephew?

226
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,600
What do you want?

227
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,680
So impatient.

228
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,200
Can't we catch up a little first?

229
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,200
And stop fighting it already.

230
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:59,800
You've studied enough about me
to know this by now.

231
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,360
In this place, no one can touch me.

232
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,200
Then just kill me already.

233
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,559
Do you know something?

234
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,320
If I wanted to kill you,

235
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,440
it'd be ridiculously easy.

236
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,999
But it wouldn't be elegant.

237
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,160
To hell with elegant!

238
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:56,520
Do you know what's most elegant about
the <i>Bu-nga Muen Phamorn</i> dress?

239
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,800
It's the code.

240
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:21,080
The set of commands,
written under impossibly perfect rules.

241
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,440
That's what makes it elegant.

242
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,160
Even someone like me

243
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:32,480
can't touch the dress directly.

244
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:39,720
Artifacts of that level must be created
through advanced rituals,

245
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,639
with dozens, hundreds,
of lives sacrificed.

246
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,519
And in the end, you have to use
your own blood and soul

247
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,560
to write the final code meticulously.

248
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:59,400
The only way to possess it
is to follow the rules.

249
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,200
It's perfect.

250
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,160
- There's nothing more elegant--
- I don't give a damn!

251
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,239
Quit rambling about this elegant shit!

252
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,400
And--

253
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,480
Shut up and let me finish,
you little shit.

254
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,400
People like you,

255
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,840
you contaminate the whole system.

256
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,120
I won't let that happen.

257
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,360
Anyone who turns their back
on these sacred rules

258
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,360
must be eliminated.

259
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,800
Let me go!

260
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,200
Quit.

261
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,120
Quit.

262
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,840
I'm out!

263
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,040
I'm going to... I'm out!

264
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,200
I'm pulling out!

265
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,240
Do you understand now?

266
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:21,920
I will never let anyone
taint this competition.

267
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,480
What do you want?

268
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,599
I'm giving you a chance.

269
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,960
You used to be my favorite nephew.

270
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,400
Tell Plengpin to withdraw.

271
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,600
Give up.

272
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:49,480
The two of you will never beat the rest.

273
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,520
The rest?

274
00:26:59,080 --> 00:26:59,920
Yes.

275
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,520
You think I only planted one or two
of my disciples among the crew?

276
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,439
Ms. Plengpin?

277
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,240
This is the crew.

278
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,320
We have to shoot
some extra interview footage.

279
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,240
Can you hear us?

280
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,480
This is the crew.

281
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,280
Ms. Plengpin?

282
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,159
Let me spell it out.

283
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,520
Other than you and Anya,

284
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:46,080
everyone else here
is one of Enigma's people.

285
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,400
Now do you get it?

286
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,160
Think hard, my dear.

287
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:04,479
You don't want to see someone you love
get killed again, do you?

288
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,480
Let me go!

289
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,279
Let me go! Let go!

290
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,400
I said let me go! Let go!

291
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,280
Let go!

292
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,080
Let go!

293
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,320
I'll give you one last chance.

294
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,080
Help me, Ajin!

295
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,160
- But hurry...
- No!

296
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,999
No!

297
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,400
- Before I change my mind.
- Help!

298
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,440
Ajin, help me!

299
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,400
No!

300
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,800
Plengpin!

301
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,439
Whoa, hotshot!

302
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,440
You're up.

303
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,760
Come help us with the shoot.

304
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,880
Wait!

305
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,600
Did something happen to you?

306
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,880
Ajin! What's the matter?

307
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,920
What happened?!

308
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,880
Ajin!

309
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,760
What's the matter? What happened?

310
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,240
I'm sorry.

311
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,960
I'm really sorry.

312
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,400
Let's pull out of this.

313
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,879
Based on this chapter of the novel,

314
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,719
the contestants must search
for magical orchids,

315
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:44,520
hidden somewhere in this dark mansion,
with only a lantern to guide them.

316
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,599
Whoever finds the most orchids

317
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,200
gets the highest score and wins.

318
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,760
Ready?

319
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,839
<i>Team A, take your positions.</i>

320
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,320
<i>Starting the timer now.</i>

321
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,560
Zone B, they're almost there.
Make sure we don't miss it.

322
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,920
- Should we go to the monitor room now?
- Yeah.

323
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,800
So Plengpin really did withdraw, huh?

324
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,360
Yes, she did.

325
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,840
I've already confirmed it with the team.

326
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,440
What a shame.

327
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,960
Didn't you say you wanted screen time?

328
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,360
Come on.

329
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,520
- Don't overthink--
- Ajin.

330
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,600
If what you told me is true...

331
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,360
then what Madam Kosum said
doesn't make sense.

332
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,280
What do you mean?

333
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,240
We might actually have a chance to win.

334
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,800
POETRY FROM THE NOVEL

335
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,039
- How far along are they?
- They've started collecting orchids.

336
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,240
Seems like it's going
faster than expected.

337
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,639
Oh!

338
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,799
Myday just got another one.

339
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,520
She has three now.

340
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,720
That pair has great instincts.

341
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:35,000
When you said we might have a chance
to win, what did you mean?

342
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:39,760
Something feels off about Anya's case.

343
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:46,480
You said you saw her lantern go out
when she was killed, right?

344
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,360
She died. That's why it went out.

345
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,760
Are you sure?

346
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,719
Think carefully.

347
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,520
Did it go out before or after she died?

348
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,319
Before.

349
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:12,399
Exactly. And the way Madam Kosum
described the dress,

350
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,520
the rules are so powerful that
even she can't break them.

351
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,999
So what if she couldn't kill Anya

352
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,080
unless Anya said she's out first?

353
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,160
Which means

354
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,559
her threats to kill us
might just be bluffs.

355
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:41,160
What she really wants is to get us
to say "we withdraw" ourselves.

356
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,920
That might be true.

357
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,840
But so what?

358
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,879
We withdrew.

359
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,840
We haven't said the word.

360
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,079
And more importantly,

361
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,840
I saw it with my own eyes.

362
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,080
Saw what?

363
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,560
My lantern it's still lit.

364
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,960
How do you know?

365
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,240
<i>For real,</i>

366
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,400
if we go back now, we might still make it.

367
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,480
Plengpin.

368
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,920
- But I don't think--
- Hey!

369
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,040
Ajin,

370
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,480
we don't have time to hesitate!

371
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,239
Myday is currently in the lead.

372
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,840
Jew is just slightly behind.

373
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,319
Got one!

374
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,600
Let's keep going!

375
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,920
What are you doing?

376
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,240
What's wrong with Myday?

377
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,240
It looks like Plengpin
did something to her.

378
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,199
Now that's more like it!
This game's getting interesting.

379
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,200
But that's cheating.

380
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,359
You can't just take the orchids
from another contestant.

381
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:06,200
Why not? There's no rule against it.

382
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,480
Keep recording. Get plenty of coverage.

383
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,080
Let's pull up this screen.

384
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,280
Plengpin.

385
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,960
You asshole!

386
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,640
This is how you want to play?!

387
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,200
You think I can't break your spell?!

388
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,160
Hurry and give her flowers back.

389
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,080
Let go! Let go of me!

390
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,120
What just happened?

391
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,279
What's going on here?

392
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,319
Looks like all the security cameras
went out.

393
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,919
- I'll work on fixing it now.
- No time!

394
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,040
Grab a camera and go shoot outside.

395
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,520
Hurry! Move!

396
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,120
Weird, huh?

397
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,000
You were already given a clean exit,

398
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,360
but you were dumb enough to come back.

399
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,839
You really are a fascinating woman.

400
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,160
Reckless.

401
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,160
Impulsive.

402
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,600
Smart.

403
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,520
But I still don't get you.

404
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,680
No matter how hard you fight,

405
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,120
it's all pointless.

406
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,760
Myday!

407
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,159
Here are your orchids.

408
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:49,239
<i>Because in the end,
every single precious orchid...</i>

409
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,399
Thanks.

410
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,440
<i>...ends up in the hands of the same people.</i>

411
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,920
<i>No matter who wins this contest,</i>

412
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,600
<i>Enigma wins anyway.</i>

413
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,600
What you're doing now
is tossing a pebble into a lake.

414
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,080
It makes a ripple, sure.

415
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,000
But it doesn't change anything.

416
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:24,200
Whether you came back or not...

417
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,600
in the end,

418
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:44,160
the audience will still get
the same ending.

419
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,200
Isn't that right?

420
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,999
<i>But you know how it works.</i>

421
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,400
In this industry,
no one cares about the truth.

422
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,320
What matters is
what we want the audience to see.

423
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,400
But if you never try, you'll never know.

424
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,520
Hey! Help!

425
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,479
Hey!

426
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,800
He's not breathing!

427
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,320
Hey!

428
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,120
Hey!

429
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,320
- You got him?
- Hey!

430
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,400
- Hey!
- Hey!

431
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,199
Quick, grab her!

432
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,360
Wait!

433
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,320
Plengpin.

434
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,839
I don't get it.

435
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,480
Why did you do that?

436
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,279
Your time's up.

437
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,200
The game is over.

438
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,839
You know you lost.

439
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,679
So why keep going?

440
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,760
That's not true.

441
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,839
Who gets to decide
if Plengpin lost or not?

442
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,720
Isn't that you, sir?

443
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,480
What's that supposed to mean?

444
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,120
We have all the proof now

445
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,480
that you deliberately tried
to hide Anya's body.

446
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:14,239
And if I press this one button,

447
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,480
the footage will be sent to the police
and the press.

448
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,960
You wouldn't want the show
to end like that, right?

449
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:31,479
So let Plengpin move on to the next round.

450
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,639
Are you crazy?!

451
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,959
You're part of the crew!
You can't just side with a contestant!

452
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,480
Mind your business!

453
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,680
Let me ask you something.

454
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,800
Aekasit really is dead, isn't he?

455
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,080
Yes.

456
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:48,920
All right.

457
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,640
Everyone, listen up.

458
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,320
From this moment on,

459
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,880
I'm taking complete control
of this production.

460
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,240
- But, sir--
- I said, shut it!

461
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,240
And you two...

462
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,040
You gave one hell of a performance.

463
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,800
Congratulations. You're moving on.

464
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,679
<i>Unbelievably, someone actually found
the special orchid</i>

465
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,479
<i>that the show team hid
at the bottom of the mansion's pool.</i>

466
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:20,000
Oh, Myday, you haven't packed yet?

467
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,880
Drop the act.

468
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,399
Let's finish this together.

469
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:30,879
<i>What I need from you is your commitment
to deliver the best show possible.</i>

470
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:37,720
<i>Let's spend these last moments
enjoying watching the show.</i>
