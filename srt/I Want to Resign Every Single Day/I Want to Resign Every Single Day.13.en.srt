00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,280
Why do you even follow me to the toilet?

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,240
In case you don't have any toilet paper.

(In case you take the elevator, actually.)

Wait for me in the office.

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,520
I'll call you when I need anything.

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,720
A secretary should always stand by.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,800
But if you stand here,

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,360
how could I lightly...?

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,470
Lightly?

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,200
I'll be waiting in the office, then.

13
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,040
(She's so dependent on me.)

14

Did you see Secretary Bai?

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,720
Yes.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,480
Is she stressed out

29
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,400
and out of her mind

30
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,520
just because of Mr. Jin?

31
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,760
Maybe. Mr. Jin squeezes her all the time.

32
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,480
I heard a few days ago,

33
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,920
her ex-boyfriend dumped her.

34
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,760
Maybe she was provoked.

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,760
Seriously?

36
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,400
Yeah.

37
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,200
Is it really so hard

38
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,560
to approve my resignation?

(Did he fall into the toilet?)

45
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,960
Secretary Bai, do you
have anything to tell me?

46
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:00,920
No.

47
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,200
I hope so.

48
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,480
Make more copies of the file
for tomorrow's bidding

49

and let's check.

OK.

51

Zhe, what's wrong?

52
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,000
The paper is stuck, I guess.

53

Let me check.

Thanks, Secretary Bai.

62
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,760
The printer is aging.

63
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,880
You can apply for a new one

64

Secretary Bai, are you available tonight?

66
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,720
I went to a good restaurant

67

named France.

68
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,640

It's OK.

A secretary should stand by
around the clock.

I can also learn more from you.
