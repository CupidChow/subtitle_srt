Why am I aching all over?

Do you know how annoying you are?

8
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,760

Morning, Secretary Bai.

17
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,760
Boss, you're awake?

18
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,080
This is great.

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,440
I told all departments
the meeting was moved up half an hour.

20
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,310
Within a quarter, pick me up
downstairs of my apartment.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,360
I want two Chinese crepes from...

Wait, wait.

23
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,160
Why does it sound so familiar?

00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,400
What are you talking about?

25
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,040
What date is it today?

26
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,680
Are you my secretary or am I yours?

27
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,040
Hurry.

28
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,140

Open the door.

33
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,160
Yes.

34
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,280
OK, Boss.

35
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,080
Boss, your cufflink dropped.

36
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,320
(It's the same in my dream.)

37
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,800
No appetite. I don't want it.

38
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,920
(Oh, no, the elevator.)

39
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,560
Boss, the elevator is out of service.

40

Let's go up the stairs.

41
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,320
I'm already in the car.

42
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,560
OK.

43
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,400
Be right there.

44
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,480
Out of service?

45
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,720
Get out of my way.

46
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,600
(What's this about?)

47
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,760
Let's take the stairs.

48
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,640
(I feel I reviewed these files before.)

49
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,720
(And the cufflink and elevator.)

50
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,920
(Why do I feel
all those things happened once?)

51
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,600
(I managed to resign.)

52
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,080
(But why is this day repeating again?)

53
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,560
(If they really happened before...)

54

Secretary Bai...

55
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,360
(Does my resignation
have nothing to do with the loop?)

56
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,800
(Oh, no!)

57
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,400
(Oh, no, I forgot about you.)

58
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,920
Bai Jing,

59
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,000
why did you have me fired?

60
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,360
How dare you bully my girl!

61
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:23,720
Mr. Jin...

62
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,520
Get out!

63
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,960
Don't hurt the image of our company.

64
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,280
(I was still late.)

65
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,520
(But why did I predict this?)

66
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,080
Boss,

67
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,920
I should buy noodles for you, huh?

68
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,840
I'll freshen up

69
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,920
and go immediately.

70
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,640
Why do noodles sound so unpleasant?

71
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,240
Secretary Bai,

72
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,960
what will you have for lunch?

73
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,080
Me?

74
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,280
(Why doesn't he want noodles today?)

75
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,600
Secretary Bai...

76
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,960
(He doesn't like it?)

77
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,520
Boss, spicy hot pot is cheap.

78
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,720
But it has meat and vegetables.

79
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,360
There are many flavors, too.

80
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,200
It's perfect for an employee.

81
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,000
I just want some chopped scallion.

82
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,520
Chopped scallion?

83
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,040
OK, OK.

84
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,680
The taste of the restaurant
at University Avenue.

85
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,080
Ms. Zhang's Spicy Hot Pot
near the east gate of the university...

86
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,480
In the right lane 300 meters away.

87
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,200
Boss, you also went there before?

88
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,480
It's very popular with college students.

89
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,320
I often eat late there.

90
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,320
Sectary Bai,

91
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,520
why did you come to our company
after graduation?

92
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,640
Because

93
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,120
I...

94
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,720
Shi'an,

95
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,320
you even eat spicy hot pot?

96
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,720
Secretary Bai,

97
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,160
the contract period should be five years.

98
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,840
Could you modify it?

99
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,200
No problem.

100
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,440
Shi'an, tonight...

101
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,040
Ms. Feng,

102
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,560
I know what you're going to say.

103
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,680
But you'd better not say it.

104
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,600
Because you won't get
a satisfactory answer.

105
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,120
And since when could you

106
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,520
order my secretary about?

107
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,360
I want to tell you something
about the meeting this afternoon.

108
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,080
(Meeting?)

109
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,120
Mr. Wang is the actual controller
of Kewei Corporation,

110

instead of Mr. Li who has been
interacting with us.

111
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,240
Mr. Wang has a company
of suspected fraudulent activities.

112
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,480
Before signing the contract this afternoon,

113
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,240
show me the information about Mr. Wang

114

with Kewei Corporation.

115
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,680
OK.

116
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,120
The contract is modified.

117
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,960
Where's Ms. Feng?

118
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,800
Sit down.

119
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,320
And finish your lunch.

120
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,880
The taste hasn't changed at all.

121
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,240
I slipped up in the reference checking.

collect the evidence

128
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,240
on their suspected fraudulent activities

129
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,360
in case they blame us.

(Weird.)
