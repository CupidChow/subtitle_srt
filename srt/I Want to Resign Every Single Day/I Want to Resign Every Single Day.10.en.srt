=Episode 10=

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:11,920
You...

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:14,960
Why?

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,320
Today is Valentine's Day.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,400
I'm just dressed up. Go.

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,440
(What a pretty dress!)

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,760
(I'm sure she'll date someone.)

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,160
Secretary Bai, are you done
with today's work?

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:39,960
Not yet.

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,680
Then why...?

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,560
So, I came to your apartment

13
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,360
and work overtime with you.

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,280
Let's go.

15
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,280
(So, she's dressed up for me.)

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,240
(Boss.)

17
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,200
Boss.

18
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,800
Boss.

19
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,800
Who's this?

20
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm Bai Jing, Mr. Jin's secretary.

21
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,440
Secretary Bai,

22
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,000
you're not what I heard about you.

23
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,880
Did you speak ill of me

24
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,960
in front of her?

25
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,480
What's wrong with you?

26
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,840
You must have done that.

27
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,360
How annoying!

28
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,200
I'll go get changed.

29
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,480
I'm thirsty, ma'am. Get me some water.

30
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:42,880
OK.

31
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,000
And some crisps and sliced fruit.

32
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,800
Does it look beautiful?

33
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:04,960
Yes.

34
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,240
Shi'an bought it for me.

35
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,000
He bought it for his secretary?

36
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,760
We're more than

37
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,280
a boss-secretary relationship.

38
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,800
You get it.

39
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,200
What's your relationship, then?

40
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,600
Don't worry. I won't cling to him.

41
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,320
I have five boyfriends.

42
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,640
I'm too busy to hang out.

43
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,600
They live in Beijing, Shanghai,

44
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,360
Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Chengdu.

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,160
Let me show you their photos.

46
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,720
(I'm of easy virtue, aren't I?)

47
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,600
But Shi'an is the best one.

48
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,640
Guess how much this is.

49
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,360
300?

50
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,920
500?

51
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,080
No.

52
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,360
50,000.

53
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,440
It's worth 50,000?

54
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,560
(It's only five yuan, actually.)

55
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,240
It's no big deal, though.

56
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,520
The car in front of the house

57
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,280
belongs to me.

58
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,920
(Spendthrift enough, huh?)

59
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,480
Shi'an,

60
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,120
you're so generous to Secretary Bai.

61
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,600
Secretary Bai,

62
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,200
I wonder if you like the dishes.

63
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,320
Try some.

64
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,960
They don't look appetizing.

65
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,480
But these are dishes

66
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,960
Shi'an has been eating since little.

67
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,040
You had quite a poor life.

68
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,560
I'll cook for you in the future.

69
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,080
Let's order some food now.

70
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,720
Stop.

71
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,320
This shirt

72
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,240
is made by an Italian designer.

73
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,520
It says,

74
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,000
no washing.

75
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,200
It can't be washed.

76
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,600
She's finally getting angry.

77
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,440
Secretary Bai, are you trying to fire me?

78
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:17,360
Fire...

79
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,070
Fire you? No, no, no.

80
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,320
Shouldn't you give me two million

81
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,560
and ask me to leave your son?

82
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,640
My son?

83
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,840
But I have only one daughter.

84
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,200
Isn't Boss your son?

85
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,160
My mother passed away 20 years ago.

86
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,200
Ms. Zhang, you can knock off.

87
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,680
Yes, Boss.

88
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,840
Really?

89
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,720
(How dramatic!)

90
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,320
Boss, let me explain.

91
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,880
This is all a big misunderstanding.

92
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,360
Secretary Bai, you helped a lot today.

93
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,440
What do you mean?

94
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,080
Ms. Zhang indeed cooks poorly.

95
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,640
She often ruins my shirts, too.

96
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,800
But she's been taking care of me
since I was little.

97
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,560
I can't complain too much.

98
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,280
There's even a moment

99
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,360
when you can't complain?

100
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,760
But after what you did,

101
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,520
she must have realized

102
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,920
her problems with work.

103
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,140
(May 20, Friday)

(I still failed to resign.)

106
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,520
Secretary Bai, don't drink too much.

107
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,520
Secretary Bai, you're drunk.

108
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,600
I'm not drunk.
