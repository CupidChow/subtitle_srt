00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,520
Secretary Bai...

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,200
(Why did I close my eyes?)

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,320
You're not what I think you are.

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,640
I...

8
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,360
Still May 20?

9
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,960
It's not prophecy.

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,760
It's a time loop.

11
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,480
(I'm really chosen to save the world.)

12

Bai Jing,

13
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,960
how dare you slap me!

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,320
Secretary Bai,

15
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,720
you're not what I think you are.

16
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,320
Oh, no.

17
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,240
Jin Shi'an must have mocked me
for flattering myself.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,240
So, why did I close my eyes?

19
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,400
How ashamed!

20
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,960
Why did my phone die?

21
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,880
Half past ten?

22
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,520
Boss, what brings you here?

23
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,400
Secretary Bai, you skipped work.

24
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,320
You didn't answer the phone
or attend the morning meeting.

25
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,000
(Calm down. He doesn't remember, anyway.)

26
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,160
(Calm down.)

27
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,400
Sorry, Boss.

28
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,000
I overslept.

29
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,720
That's perfect.

30
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,440
Perfect for lunch.

31
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,750
I bought five Chinese crepes for you.

32
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,320
(He bought lunch for me?)

33
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,960
(Does he really like...?)

34
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,720
Thank you, Boss.

35
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,200
It's late. Time for brunch.

36
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,120
Eat more.

37
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,760
(You don't like crepes? I'll make you eat.)

38
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,920
(Why does it sound so sweet?)

39
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,240
(Why does she look happy?)

40
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,920
(Champion)
Good for you.

41
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,800
You can do boxing.

42
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,920
I even have a gold belt.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,760
Bai Jing!

44
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,440
How could you hate me so much?

45
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,600
Boss, let me explain. I...

46
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,080
(It's crumpled.)

47
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,680
(She must have punched it many times.)

48
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,240
How ungrateful you are!

49
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,160
Stop eating.

50
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,240
Get changed and go to work.

51
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,760
Bai Jing,

52
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,160
you're chubby.

53
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,360
Take the stairs for some exercise.

54
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,520
Am I really chubby?

55
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,480
When she wants to resign
and works for Tengfei,

56
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,640
she still works so hard.

57
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,040
Look, the collection
and payment of this season

58
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,160
and the...

59
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,320
Secretary Bai, what on earth
are you thinking?

60
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,400
Is she...?

61
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,000
(Is she a business spy from Tengfei?)

62
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,620
(Finance Department)

63
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,320
(I caught you.)

64
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,320
Secretary Bai...

65
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,160
(Why is he holding my hand again?)

66
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,960
You really let me down.

67
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,680
What are you holding?

68
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,280
Holding?

69
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,480
The pay sheet of Director Li.

70
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,520
Good job.

71
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,600
What's wrong with him?

72
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,520
And what's wrong with me?

73
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,360
(She doesn't look like a traitor.)

74
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,840
(Is she brought over by Tengfei
because she's short of money?)

75
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,800
(He's been staring at me for ten minutes.)

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,200
(What on earth does he want?)

77
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,780
(Li will splash water.)

78
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,840
Boss, it's my cup.

79
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,440
I'm thirsty, OK?

80
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,400
You...

81
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,000
Bai Jing, why did you have me fired?

82
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,560
Mr. Jin, you must speak for me.

83
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,800
- Secretary Bai...
- I have you fired. Get out!

84
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,760
(He's really weird today.)

85
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,600
(Where's she going during working hours?)

86
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,040
(To interact with Tengfei?)

(Why is he following me again?)

88
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,080
(Does he really like me?)

89
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,680
Boss, what's up?

90
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,360
Secretary Bai,

91
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,200
has anything happened to your family?

92
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,760
Do you need any help?

93
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,600
(Oh, dear. He's even caring
about my family.)

94
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,240
Everything is fine.

95
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,200
Many people like to spend money
more than they have

96
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
but they can't pay the debt.

97
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,680
Have you used P2P Lending?

98
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,400
P2P Lending? You want that?

99
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,360
Anything wrong with our...?

100
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,800
I'm asking if you have used that.

101
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,040
But if you need,

102
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,200
I can go get some information.

103
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,800
No.

104
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,840
Where are you going?

105
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,840
To the toilet. And you?

106
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,920
Me, too.

107
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,280
What a coincidence! Let's go together.

108
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,920
(Again?)

109
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,000
What?

110
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,480
Get in the car.

111
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,400
(He'll drive me home?)

112
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,560
(Does the time loop change his character)

113
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,440
(or does he really...?)

114
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,160
(It's really coming.)

115
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,840
Secretary Bai,

116
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,400
what do you think of Tengfei?

117
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,000
Tengfei...

118
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,440
It's good.

119
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,880
And when compared to our company?

120
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,040
Tengfei is a big company
with much experience.

121
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,240
In comparison,

122
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,360
it has a better foundation.

123
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,960
(She's indeed disloyal.)

124
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,200
(Don't come any closer.)

125
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,040
(Bai Jing, hold it.)

126
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,960
Get out of the car.

127
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,800
She indeed takes Tengfei's side.

128
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,160
How hypocritical!

129
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,000
Bai Jing!

130
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,840
Boss.

131
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,000
Oh, no.

132
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,960
(Jin Shi'an is quite insane.)

133
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,520
(Why did he suddenly get angry?)

134
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,280
(First, he offered to drive me back.)

135
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,880
(Then he kicked me out of the car.)

136
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,200
That was close.

137
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,760
(Oh, no.)

138
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,400
(Did Jin Shi'an take the elevator again?)

139
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,320
Secretary Bai.

140
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,640
