You get it?

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,920
So, you started the time loop first?

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,000
Yes. At first, I thought

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,120
when I managed to resign,

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,240
the time loop would stop.

you uploaded the
certificate of resignation for me.

(I knew she didn't resign
because she hated me.)

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,000
So, you resign because you want
to end the loop?

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,560
Not really.

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,880
So, when you were drunk,

16
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,280
you complained about me

17
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,360
for being a selfish and sick capitalist.

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,920
You even throw your
certificate of resignation

at my face.

20

Secretary Bai, ask the Maintenance Department

OK.

Should the company's elevator be fixed too?

Why?

You asked me to swim, huh?

76

I haven't done that
since the loop started.

No wonder I think you look chubby.

How could I be chubby
when the day repeats?

79
