Sorry, Mr. Jin.

18
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,760
He's just an intern.

19
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,280
When others asked him
to clock out for them,

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,840
he could hardly say no, right?

21

Are you saying he isn't wrong?

No, no. I mean...

Young people make mistakes.

Hope you can give him a second chance.

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,520
Just like you often give me a chance

26
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,800
so generously.

27
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,880
Never let it happen again.

Thank you, Mr. Jin.

Thanks, Secretary Bai.

May I invite you to dinner?

No, thanks.

I have to work overtime.

I have to work overtime, too.

Let's have dinner in the office, then.

36
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,280
I'll take care of it.

Secretary Bai,

38
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,840
a new office rule.

39

Anyone in office romance will be fired.

What's wrong with him?

41
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,280
Fired?

let me feed you.

50

Come on. Open your mouth.

51
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,320
What else would you like?

52
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,040
How about this?

53
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,200
Or this?

54
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,160
Do you like watching movies?

55
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,040
Yes.

56
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,840
I love animation movies.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,960
Me, too.

58
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,000
Really? Then...

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,720
Boss, what's this about?

60
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,240
Today is Valentine's Day.

61
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:56,920
I'm offering you a chance

62
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,640

(See?)

71
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,800
By the way, Zhe,

72
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,960
what do you like to do at weekends?

73
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,600
Play badminton. And you?

74
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,400
I like that, too.

75
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,360
How about we play badminton this weekend?

76
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,080
Good idea.

77
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,040
Mr. Jin, would you like to join us?

78
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,040
I...

79
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,560
Mr. Jin only plays golf.

80
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,840
We two can go together.

81
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:42,840
OK.

82
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,000
Zhe, go make some tea.

83
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,280
OK.

84
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,120
Boss, I think

85
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,880
he and I make a great couple.

86
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,680
I'm three years old than him, perfect.

87
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,600
We also

88
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,480
have the same hobbies.

89
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,680
If we go on like this, Boss...

90
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,760
Do you remember the new office rule?

91
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,640
He and I...

92
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,640
What new rule?

93
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,680
I don't remember.

94
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,480
Drive me home.

what other sports do you like?

101

Yoga.

102
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,680
I can do yoga.

103
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,480
This weekend, how about we...?

104
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,640
Ms. Feng?

105

Secretary Bai,

106
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,520
how soon can we get her home?

107
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
In 15 minutes.

108
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,640
Stop the car!

109
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,880
Shi'an, you picked me up?

110
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,840
Ms. Feng, I'm Bai Jing.

111
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,120
How disappointing!

112
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,560
Earlier today, I failed
to ask you out for a movie.

113
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,920
How disappointing!

114
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,240
Do you remember

115
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,640
when you started the company?

116
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,480
Back then,

117
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,000
you had only one office.

118
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,920
But now, you have an entire floor.

119
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,040
Shi'an,

120
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,840
I always have something to tell you.

121
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,520
Go ahead.

122
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,640
I love you.
