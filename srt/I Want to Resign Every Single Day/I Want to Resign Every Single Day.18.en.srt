3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,040
Bai Jing! Bai Jing!

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,320
Wake up!

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,200
We are

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,520
now square.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,440
You'd better turn yourself in.

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,000
Turn myself in? I've got no turning back.

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,520
You'll regret it.

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,040
I'm just making a living.

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,200
Sorry.

12
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,320
Mr. Jin, Secretary Bai,

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,000
what are you doing?

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,000
I said I would make you regret it.

15
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,560
For what?

16
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,360
You know this, don't you?

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:52,920
I don't.

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,040
It's OK when you deny it.

19
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,880
You can confess it to the police.

20
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,760
911? I have...

21
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,520
Stop!

22
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,480
I have a case to report.

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,680
Ignore me.

24
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,760
- Go after him! Go!
- OK.

25
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,840
Yeah, now we're at...

26
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:18,140
(Police)

27
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,040
The police were awesome.

28
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,000
Before Mr. Zhang ran out of the company,

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,960
he was caught.

30
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,200
Indeed, to interfere with the bidding,

31
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,200
Tengfei Group bought over Zhang Dayong.

32
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,080
But we won't know

33
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,080
the specific reason

34
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,920
until the police summon Chu Tian.

35
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,120
Your ankle...

36
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,440
It's OK.

37
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,280
You make me shy.

38
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,600
What are you doing?

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,800
I'm just tying my shoelaces.

40
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,080
Why?

41
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,440
For the sake that you caught the murderer,

42
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,480
I would be your transport

43
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,840
for this day.

44
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,520
No, thanks. Put me down.

45
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,470
The murderer has been caught.

46
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,120
The loop will be over after midnight.

47
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,160
I'm going back to the office
to prepare the bidding document.

48
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,280
Secretary Bai,

49
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,040
I really appreciate your hard work.

50
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,240
But I've prepared

51
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,280
the document.

52
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,800
So quickly?

53
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,240
We had several loops. It's already done.

54
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,600
What do we do now?

55
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,880
Before the loop is over,

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,200
let's celebrate.

57
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,800
It's so cool here.

58
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,960
Since I graduated,

59
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,680
I haven't been so relaxed
for a long time.

60
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,760
What was your major at the university?

61
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,160
The same as yours.

62
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,400
Computer Science?

63
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,960
Then why did you come to New Era
as a secretary?

64
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,120
Because I wanted to see

65
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,600
how the best programmer at the university

66
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,200
would work in his company.

67
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,360
Did you see that?

68
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,360
Yes.

69
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,400
I see how great you are.

70
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,560
But I also see how annoying you are.

71
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,280
Bai Jing!

72
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,120
Just kidding.

73
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,000
Actually, I make you
eat Chinese crepes every day

74
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,960
because I think you love them.

75
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,960
Chinese crepes can be

76
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,360
the best breakfast in the world.

77
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,640
Oh, I see.

78
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,120
But however delicious they are,

79
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,880
I'll be fed up if I eat them every day.

80
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,240
Anyway, no matter what I do,

81
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,760
you think I'm exploiting you.

82
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,680
You even save my number as Nagger.

83
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,240
Boss, be a bigger person

84
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,600
and forgive me.

85
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,100
(Idol)

86
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,600
OK.

87
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,280
Idol.

88
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,880
Don't be mad at me anymore.

89
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,280
Look.

90
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,240
How beautiful!

91
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,760
Indeed.

92
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,520
Hello.

93
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,760
Secretary Bai, check the date.

94
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,100
(May 20, Friday)

95
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,160
May 20?

96
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,440
Why is it still May 20?

97
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,840
The loop isn't over yet?
