Jin Shi'an!

Jin Shi'an.

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,320
What did you say?

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,200
Amb...

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,560
Amb... Amb...

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,040
Hang in there, Boss.

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,760
The loop will be over at midnight.

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,800
One minute to go.

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,000
Amb...

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:36,920
Amb...

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:38,960
(Right.)

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,880
(We'll try if kissing can end the loop.)

15
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:42,920
Hang in there.

16
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,240
I'll kiss you at midnight.

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,240
Twenty seconds to go.

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,760
(Don't kiss me.
If the loop is over, I'll die.)

19
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,800
Why are you so impatient?

20
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,760
Fine. Here I go.

21
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,160
(Five, four, three, two, one.)

22

Amb...

23
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,230
Amb... Amb...

24
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,880
(Luckily, the loop isn't over.)

25
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,360
Instead of saving my life,

26
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,440
Secretary Bai even tried to kill me.

27
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,200
How did you get in?

28
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,360
I'm very disappointed, Secretary Bai.

29
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,040
When I was so badly wounded,

30
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,720
you kissed me, trying to end the loop.

31
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,760
How malicious!

32
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,800
But last night, you pouted

33
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,080
and urged me to kiss you.

34
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,000
I said, amb... amb...

35
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,880
I wanted you to get an ambulance.

36
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,880
Amb...

37
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,440
I didn't quite understand then.

38
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,080
And the loop was going to start.

39
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,400
Time was running out.

40
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,320
It was the ambulance's problem.

41
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,000
But you had a big attitude problem.

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,880
Jin Shi'an, I...

43
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,120
Jin Shi'an?

44
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,320
You saved my life.

45
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,190
So, I conceded in the previous loops.

46
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,360
But you shouldn't ask too much.

47
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,320
Think of it this way.

48
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,120
We're in a time loop.

49
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,440
I don't get paid.

50
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,760
We're friendly and equal.

51
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,080
You're not a boss.

52
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,160
Fine.

53
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,880
Let's get even when the loop is over.

54
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,760
OK.

55
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,600
By the way,

56
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,720
when the Maintenance Department
fixed the elevator,

57
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,840
they found it was tampered with.

58
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,160
Hello?

59
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:40,960
Wait.

60
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:41,920
What?

61
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,280
I suddenly remember

62
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,480
the noise I heard on the phone

63
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,920
was the falling of the elevator.

64
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,480
Are you saying

65
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,360
every time I called you,

66
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,680
I was in an elevator accident?

67
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,360
Yes.

68
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,960
It didn't happen in every loop

69
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,920
and it didn't cause the loop.

70
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,520
But it proves

71
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,800
someone wants to kill you in every loop.

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,320
The elevator of my apartment...

73
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,000
And the car crash yesterday.

74
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,960
Someone wants to kill me?

75
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,600
Yeah.

76
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,240
According to the limitless genre,

77
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,200
the key to ending the loop
is to find the murderer.

78
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,640
But...

79
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,960
I'm a much-loved man.

80
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,560
Who would like to kill me?

81
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,800
A lot of people.

82
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,120
All right, Mr. Wang.

83
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,680
Don't worry.

84
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,640
As long as I work here,
your project will succeed.

85
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,040
It must be him.
After he's fired, he hates me.

86
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,200
So, he wants to kill me.

87
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,320
Wrong.

88
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,920
In the last loop, you didn't fire him.

89
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,040
He doesn't have a motive.

90
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,640
Then who else could it be?

91
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,920
Oh, I know. It's Chubby.

92
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,640
Why does he want to kill me?

93
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,560
(Because you...)

94
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,320
The first bubble tea in summer.

95
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,680
The calorie of bubble tea is 500.

96
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,160
Based on your basal metabolism,

97
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,320
you can't burn off these calories
until you run for an hour.

98
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,680
Are you sure you'll still drink it?

99
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,240
Kill me for bubble tea?

100
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,950
And you know he has a fatty liver disease?

101
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,400
Then Feifei wants to kill you most.

102
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,120
She feels the cold most.

103
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,600
I lower the temperature
of air conditioners just to warn you.

104
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,480
But why?

105
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,720
I want you to wear long skirts at work.

106
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,400
When you wear short skirts,

107
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,120
others keep staring at you.

108
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,760
It seriously affects work efficiency.

109
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,120
They two are suspicious, too.

110
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,640
Good.

111
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,280
Today, you've learned more than others.

112
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,520
So much for today.

113
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,840
It's a quarter past eleven.

114
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,320
You can catch the last metro.

115
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,560
I deliberately let them leave

116
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,360
before the last metro.

117
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,760
Isn't it sweet?

118
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,320
What's the problem?

119
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,520
According to our rule,
if anyone works overtime till midnight,

120
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,880
he can claim the taxi fare

121
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,800
and be one hour late the next morning.

122
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,280
But what have you done?

123
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,960
Every day, you let them leave
at half past eleven.

124
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,880
That's quite close.

125
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,840
Looks like

126
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,640
everyone in our company
has the motive to kill you.

127
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,880
It's understandable. You're so annoying.

128
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,520
It's normal that people want to kill you.

129
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,880
Secretary Bai.

130
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,920
In this case,

131
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,720
I think you have the biggest motive.

132
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,480
I... I...

133
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,400
How's that possible?

134
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,240
Every time you're in trouble,

135
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,080
I'm there with you.

136
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,840
What if you want to die with me?

137
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,040
Mr. Jin, Secretary Bai,

138
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,360
what are you doing here?

139
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,640
Observing secretly.

140
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,760
Got it.

141
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,480
I went to a good restaurant

142
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,960
named France.

143
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,080
Shall we have dinner there together?

144
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,560
Zhe, what a big dinner!

145
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,000
Wait.

146
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,320
Chu Zhe is fishy, too.

147
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,400
Why?

148
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,480
He's only an intern.

149
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,200
But he invited me to a French restaurant
whose per capita charge is 5,000.

150
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,560
And his motorcycle is worth
hundreds of thousands.

151
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,160
He...

152
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,960
He invited you to dinner?

153
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,120
Nearly in every loop.

154
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,840
How many times has he invited you?

155
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,680
Not many times.

156
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,360
But I'll invite him to dinner tonight

157
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,760
and sound him out.

158
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,560
Zhe.

159
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,320
Check out a man for me.

160
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,640
(When I look closer,
I see him wearing all designer clothes.)

161
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,280
Secretary Bai,

162
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,360
even if you didn't invite me to dinner,

163
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,520
I would invite you.

164
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,000
I know.

165
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,000
You know?

166
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,040
So, you know I...?

167
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,160
Boss.

168
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,240
Tell us.

169
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,600
Why do you work in my company?

170
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,000
