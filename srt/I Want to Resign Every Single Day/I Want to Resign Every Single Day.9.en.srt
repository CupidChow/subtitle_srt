00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:12,880
Ms. Feng,

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,480
in my eyes,

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,000
you're only a colleague.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,680
Boss, she's asleep.

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,080
Boss, you really set a good example

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,520
to reject office romance.

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,200
Zhe and I...

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,080
Walk her upstairs.

11
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,440
Get off.

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,960
Do you want me to drive you?

13
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,360
No, no.

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,440
You're back.

15
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,040
You must be Secretary Bai, huh?

16
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,800
Hello, ma'am.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,560
It's so late.

18
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,600
But you still drove Shi'an back.
Thank you.

19
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,800
My pleasure.

20
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,760
Just like Shi'an said,

21
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,320
you are pretty and competent.

22
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,440
You don't leave yet.

23
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,200
May I invite you in?

24
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:16,920
No, no.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,720
I should go.

26
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,520
Goodbye, ma'am.

27
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,640
Goodbye, Boss.

28
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,360
OK. Goodbye.

29
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,920
(My resignation failed again.)

30
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,720
Shi'an, I love you.

31
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,800
What is Ms. Feng thinking?

32
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,920
I don't see anything good
about Jin Shi'an.

33
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,960
(Stop.)

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,360
(Why am I caring about this?)

35
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,110
(Nagger)
(Nagger is calling.)

36
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,050
(Nagger is calling.)

37
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,200
Again?

38
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,240
Hello, Boss.

39
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,720
Secretary Bai, come back.

40
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,840
I left my laptop bag in the car.

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,720
Be patient, Boss.

42
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,280
It'll come back to you soon.

43
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,190
What did you say?

44
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,640
I said, good night, Boss.

45
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,250
(Nagger)
(Nagger is calling.)

46
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,600
How soon can I stop

47
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
doing this annoying job?

48
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:30,720
Just like Shi'an said,

49
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,680
you are pretty and competent.

50
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,360
(Jin Shi'an is obviously a mama's boy.)

51
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,600
(If I make his mother hate me,)

52
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,320
(he'll have no reason to keep me.)

53
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,400
(I'll go to his house after work.)

54
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,440
(I can make it.)

55
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,000
(Before that, I have to
buy noodles for his lunch.)

56
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,400
(How come Jin Shi'an doesn't like)

57
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,320
(such an excellent
and self-disciplined lady?)

58
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,080
Secretary Bai.

59
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:20,760
Ms. Feng.

60
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,640
What's on your mind?

61
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,680
Oh, I have something to tell you.

62
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,200
What is it?

63
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,160
For the contract we'll sign this afternoon,

64
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,040
you'd better check more carefully.

65
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,520
(When Ms. Feng does something helpful,)

66
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,880
(Jin Shi'an will
accept her invitation, I guess.)

67
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,800
(Oh, no. If Jin Shi'an sees a movie,)

68
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,040
(he won't approve my resignation.)

69
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,080
(I can't let this happen.)

70
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,080
Secretary Bai, tonight...

71
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,240
Sorry, but I'm occupied.

72
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,800
Isn't it just about canceling a meeting?

73
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,040
What's taking them so long?

74
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,510
When did you find out about it?

75
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,510
I slipped up in the reference checking.

76
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,360
Mr. Wang is the actual controller
of Kewei Corporation,

77
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,240
instead of Mr. Li who has been
interacting with us.

78
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,320
Mr. Wang has a company
of suspected fraudulent activities.

79
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,560
Let's not sign the contract today.

80
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,040
Your coffee, Boss.

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But I have some coffee here.

82
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,200
It's cold.

83
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,680
This cup is perfect.

84
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,120
OK.

85
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,720
What about the meeting this afternoon?

86
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,640
Cancel it.

87
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,600
As for legal affairs,

88
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,000
start to collect evidence

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,160
on their suspected fraudulent activities

90
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,280
in case they blame us.

91
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,520
I'll take care of it.

92
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,240
You helped really a lot, Jia.

93
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,880
What are you doing, Secretary Bai?

94
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,360
Sorry. Sorry.

95
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,480
Shi'an,

96
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,560
may I invite you to a movie tonight?

98
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,840

(I can't be having feelings)

105
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,280
(for Jin Shi'an, can I?)

106
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,480
(How's this possible?)

107
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,960
(It can't be. It can't be.)

108
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,680
(I must be too tired lately.)

109
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,620
(Jin Shi'an)

110

What are you doing, Secretary Bai?

111
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,760
Nothing. What's up, Boss?

112
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,040
Before you're off duty,

113
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,320
you already have nothing to do.

114
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,680
Get downstairs and drive me home.

115
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,000
Boss, you're going home

116
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,800
after work?

117
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,680
Or where else would I go?

118
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,720
