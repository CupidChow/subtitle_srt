00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,240
Tell us.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,160
Why do you work in my company?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,800
Chu Zhe. Mr. Chu Tian's son.

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:21,760
Indeed.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,440
I'm the successor of Tengfei Group.

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,120
Zhe,

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,280
did you really tamper with the elevator

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,320
to kill Jin Shi'an?

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,760
What elevator?

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,960
This morning, the Maintenance Department

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,440
found this when fixing the elevator.

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,480
It can black out the elevator
with remote control

15
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,320
and make it fall.

16
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,960
You think I put this in the elevator

17
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,120
to kill Mr. Jin?

18
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,840
You've read too many ridiculous novels.

19
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,440
It's the 21st century.

20
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,920
I'm not a villain for business battles.

21
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,760
My father indeed sent me

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,760
to check on the bidding stuff.

23
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,160
But I refused.

24
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,400
I want Tengfei and New Era

25
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,280
to have fair and healthy competition

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,120
and learn from each other

27
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,880
instead of playing dirty tricks.

28
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,160
Oh, I see.

29
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,800
Secretary Bai,

30
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,080
I didn't know you thought of me like this.

31
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,400
If this is why

32
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,880
you invited me to dinner,

33
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,920
I should go.

34
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,240
Looks like we misunderstood him.

35
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,560
He seems to be a very simple man.

36
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,840
The successor of Tengfei Group
works in our company, simple?

37
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,360
You're the simple one, I'm afraid.

38
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,680
Why do you sound so sarcastic?

39
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,760
I don't think Chu Zhe is a bad guy.

40
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,320
How many times have you had dinner with him

41
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,280
and you trust him so much?

42
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,000
I wanted to have dinner with him.

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,240
But you ruined it every time.

44
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,640
Are you blaming me?

45
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,240
Don't wander from the subject.

46
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,960
If Chu Zhe didn't do that,

47
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,680
who else could it be?

48
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,280
The control device was removed.

49
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,920
The Maintenance Department
didn't tell anyone, did they?

50
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,120
No. I asked them to keep it secret.

51
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,040
Good.

52
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,440
I've got a risky plan.

53
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,640
