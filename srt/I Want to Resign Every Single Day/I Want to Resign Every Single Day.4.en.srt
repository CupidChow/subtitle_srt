That's obvious.

That man is your boss, right?

58

You hate him most.

Never. It'll never happen.

Your mother must be
very satisfied with me, huh?

68

I'm sure she thinks

69

that an ordinary like you

70
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,560
must be very lucky

71
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,640
to have an excellent boyfriend like me.

72

You're right, Boss.

But Secretary Bai, don't get me wrong.

74
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,680
I just pretended to be your boyfriend

75
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,000
so that you could keep working
without concern.

76

Don't get it wrong.

77
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,480
Rest assured, Boss.

78
