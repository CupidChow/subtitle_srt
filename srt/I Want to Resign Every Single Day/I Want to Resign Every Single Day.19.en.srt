3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,800
The murderer was caught.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,320
The problem was solved, too.

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,640
But why isn't the loop over?

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm not able to answer.

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,360
I know. I'm just complaining.

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,280
Forget it.

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,880
Maybe there isn't a reason for the loop

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,680
and we're just stuck
in the black hole of time.

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,760
As long as we don't take today

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,160
as a repeated day,

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,000
today can also be tomorrow.

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,120
Today can also be tomorrow?

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,960
Date is just a code.

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,480
When we do different things,

17
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,640
the day will be different.

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,880
What do we do for today?

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,200
Boss, calm...

20
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,000
Calm down.

21
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,480
What do you want?

22
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,760
I don't want to wear a slim suit anymore.

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,240
Mr. Chu,

24
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,040
this is our bidding document.

25
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,560
You always want to check it, don't you?

26
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,280
(Bidding Document)
Now you can check it.

27
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,640
I don't know what you're talking about.

28
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,760
I came to tell you something.

29
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,200
Your company has developed
after all the trouble.

30
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,040
You'd better not do anything illegal

31
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,160
to break friendly competitions.

32
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,120
Or the police would come instead of me.

33
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,360
Tell Zhang Dayong to cancel his plan.

34
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,360
In the loop, I won't gain any weight.

35
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,360
Then I can try all flavors

36
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,360
with regular sugar.

37
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,280
But...

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,600
Boss,

39
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,440
you want to do yoga with me, don't you?

40
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,240
Let's get started.

41
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,640
Bai Jing,

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
could you do something
you're supposed to do?

43
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,760
Yes.

44
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,680
(Chinese Dragon Lottery)
If you want money, ask me for it.

45
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,160
Why did you buy these?

46
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,480
You have no idea. But you'll know.

47
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,280
Five yuan.

48
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,480
Ten yuan!

49
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,400
Fifty, fifty!

50
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,680
It's the first time I feel excited
for winning the lottery.

51
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,240
For only a few bucks?

52
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,720
Try it.

53
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,760
Come on.

54
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,080
Just try it.

55
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,040
Five yuan.

56
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,240
I won, Secretary Bai!

57
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,480
I won, Secretary Bai!

58
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,960
I won it. I won it!

59
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,000
We had something to eat.

60
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,440
And we won the lottery.

61
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,800
Satisfied?

62
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,520
One more thing.

63
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,280
Shi'an, huh?

64
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,120
My daughter's boss?

65
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,360
Yes, Mr. Bai.

66
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,600
Then what makes you love
my plain-looking daughter?

67
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,760
Come on, Mom.

68
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,000
Mrs. Bai,

69
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,400
appearance isn't important.

70
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,440
Shi'an, what do you see in my daughter?

71
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,720
Frankness.

72
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,640
We're in a time loop.

73
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,080
I don't get paid.

74
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,640
We're friendly and equal.

75
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,200
You're not a boss.

76
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,040
And kindness.

77
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,640
(Don't kiss me.
If the loop is over, I'll die.)

78
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,920
Here I go.

79
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,040
I love her

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,760
for her gentleness.

81
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,880
Self-discipline.

82
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,120
And...

83
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,640
Her love for sports.

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I love everything about her.

85
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,440
Shi'an,

86
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,960
you don't know very well

87
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,040
about our daughter yet. She...

88
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,400
It's normal. Beauty is
in the eye of the beholder.

89
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:36,960
Shi'an,

90
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,200
it's late and we're tired.

91
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,200
How about we all

92
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,320
sleep here?

93
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,360
Let's do it.

94
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,480
Mom,

95
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,720
how?

96
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,280
Honey.

97
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:15,960
Shi'an,

98
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,200
what do you see in my daughter?

99
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,000
Boss, the elevator is out of service.

100
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,240
Let's go up the stairs.

101
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,600
Why do you even follow me to the toilet?

102
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,040
A secretary should always stand by.

103
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,040
It's very useful.
Wipe it and it'll be clean.

104
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,080
It's OK. Let me help you.

105
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,440
I won, Secretary Bai! I won it!

106
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,480
We should step across.

107
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,440
Watch.

108
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,360
I'm just tying my shoelaces.

109
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,720
Why?

110
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,080
Look.

111
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
How beautiful!

112
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,920
Cold, isn't it?

113
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,320
You know what?

114
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,880
You look perfect in my father's shirt.

115
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,400
He snores loudly, right?

116
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,680
Like daughter, like father.

117
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,520
But I never snore.

118
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,400
Your parents must be having nice dreams.

119
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,240
After all, their ordinary daughter

120
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,440
has an excellent boyfriend like me.

121
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,000
Yes, yes.

122
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,800
Anyway, thank you

123
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,120
for playing my boyfriend

124
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,960
so that my mother won't
push me to find one.

125
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,440
Secretary Bai,

126
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,200
what kind of man do you like?

127
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,960
No idea.

128
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,080
Your ex-boyfriend proves
that you have bad taste.

129
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,200
Yeah, I've got worse taste lately.

130
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,840
You have a new target?

131
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,680
No.

132
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,480
Secretary Bai, something's fishy with you.

133
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,800
I...

134
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,240
Spider!

135
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,000
