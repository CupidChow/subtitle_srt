=Episode 3=

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,040
I always turn people down.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,240
No one has turned me down yet.

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,120
Come on.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,360
He just won't approve my resignation.

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,600
I hate it.

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,240
How on earth can I resign?

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,400
(Flat shoes won't make me fall, huh?)

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,520
Watch out.

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,840
(How on earth can I resign?)

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,200
(I don't want to buy noodles anymore.)

13
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,870
(Secretary Bai is so self-disciplined.)

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,520
(Chu Zhe, an intern at New Era)
(She even exercises when buying lunch.)

15
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,000
Secretary Bai.

16
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,360
Your earring.

17
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,200
Thank you.

18
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,520
Shall I put it on you?

19
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,520
No, thanks.

20
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,720
Secretary Bai, may I
invite you to dinner tonight?

21
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,640
- We can have...
- Zhe,

22
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,920
go talk to HR.

23
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,240
OK.

24
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,640
Boss, noodles for you.

25
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,200
No appetite. I don't want them.

26
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,200
I've been out for only three hours.

27
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,240
Wang of the Administration Department
is sleeping during his work.

28
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,680
Wu, who sits next to him,

29
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,480
has been in the toilet

30
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,080
for 15 minutes and 32 seconds.

31
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,800
Ms. Zhang of the Cleaning Department

32
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,600
is wiping the reception desk
with the rag for toilets again.

33
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,160
Secretary Bai, what do you think?

34
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,200
They shouldn't be doing this.

35
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,120
(I must resign soon.)

36
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,280
(Or it'll be too late again.)

37
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,720
Boss,

38
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,920
do you believe in star sign?

39
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,080
I've heard a little about it.

40
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,920
I did a horoscope for us.

41
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,640
You and I are ill-matched.

42
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,400
If we keep working together,

43
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,640
it may cost you your life.

44
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,080
I thought about it and decided to resign.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,080
I appreciate it.

46
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,200
But the date of birth
on my ID card is incorrect.

47
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,280
You're a Capricorn with Leo Ascendant

48
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,520
and I'm a Virgo with Sagittarius Ascendant.

49
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,400
We're matched.

50
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,400
O... OK.

51
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,600
The signing meeting
went smoothly just now.

52
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,200
But tomorrow's bidding is more important.

53
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,640
I know you were dumped.

54
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,960
No one asked you out. How about...?

55
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,640
Boss, here we are.

56
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,840
Secretary Bai, tonight...

57
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,880
Tonight, a lot of girls
must have asked you out, huh?

58
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,080
Yes, of course.

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,520
Happy Valentine's Day, then.

60
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,440
I'm knocking off.

61
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,640
When you didn't approve my resignation,

62
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,280
you still wanted me to work overtime?

63
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,320
In your dream!

64
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,600
Secretary Bai, you can eat
a lot of spicy food.

65
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,680
Spicy food is good for a bad mood.

66
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,120
Secretary Bai,

67
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,720
you're in a bad mood?

68
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,000
With a boss like Jin Shi'an,

69
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,520
who could be in a good mood?

70
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:38,880
Secretary Bai,

71
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,360
sounds like you dislike Mr. Jin.

72
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
No, no.

73
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,320
I hate him, actually.

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,240
If you feel unhappy at work,

75
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,720
you don't need to push yourself.

76
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,280
An excellent secretary like you

77
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,640
can even work at Tengfei Group.

78
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,200
You're reading my mind.

79
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,080
How I wish I could...!

Hello, Boss.

Secretary Bai,

85
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,760
email me the financial statements.

86
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,120
OK.

87
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,600
So fast? She's indeed proficient.
