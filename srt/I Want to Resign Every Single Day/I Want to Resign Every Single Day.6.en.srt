=Episode 6=

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,320
You hit us.

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,320
Watch where you're going!

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,200
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,480
The shopping cart is for commodities,

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,360
instead of humans.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,360
What are you talking about?

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:24,680
It's OK.

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,880
You think you have an excuse, huh?

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,840
Sorry. Sorry.

12
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,600
My bad. I'm sorry.

13
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:29,920
Forget it.

14
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,040
Why did you apologize to them?

15
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,360
I hit them, anyway.

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,960
Hurry. The last one.

17
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,360
Hurry.

18
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,440
There you are.

19
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,880
You must be Secretary Bai, huh?

20
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,920
Shi'an often talks about you. Come on.

21
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,800
Give the coat to me.

22
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,800
Let me iron it.

23
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,120
(Jin Shi'an is such mama's boy.)

24
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,040
(He still has his mother
wash his clothes.)

25
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,840
Take some rest. I'll make dinner later.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,680
No, thank you.

27
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,880
Don't bother, ma'am.

28
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,040
Don't say that. It's my duty.

29
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,640
Secretary Bai,

30
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,160
take a look around.
Make yourself at home.

31
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,400
What's this?

32
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,240
I've just thought of something.

33
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,960
I... I should go.

34
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,680
It's for cleaning the table.

35
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,520
I'll do some washing.

36
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,400
Young men like them are really fast.

37
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,040
Boss, dinner is ready.

38
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,040
Boss.

39
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,560
Boss?

40
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,600
Boss...

41
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,400
Secretary Bai,
knock at the door next time.

42
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,320
B... B...

43
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:28,920
Boss.

44
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,240
But there isn't a door.

45
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,760
En... Enjoy it.

46
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,640
(He's got a sexy body, anyway.)

47
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,720
What's wrong?

48
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,960
No... Nothing.

49
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,680
Nothing.

50
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,200
Secretary Bai, your mouth...

51
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,880
Left.

52
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,800
Up, up.

53
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,200
Boss, what's wrong?

54
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,200
I haven't reviewed the document
for tomorrow's bidding yet.

55
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,520
I'm going to the office.

56
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,040
After you finish, clear the table

57
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,440
and then leave.

58
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,720
(What on earth am I thinking?)

59
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,880
I wonder if Secretary Bai has left.

60
