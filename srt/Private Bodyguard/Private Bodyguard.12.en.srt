IT IS NOT TO BE FOLLOWED. VIEWER DISCRETION ADVISED.

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,038
SAY NO TO BULLY!

4
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:11,320
Talk about, "don't judge the book by it's cover."

5
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:13,919
Maybe she wasn't an illegitimate child,

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,800
but a child from her dad's affair.

7
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:19,199
That's a lie, right?

8
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:21,039
Once again, I emphasize,

9
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,719
the news is not true.

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,679
That's me and your mom.

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,359
And that little baby is you.

12
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:29,640
I’m moving to Surabaya.

13
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:31,760
My dad wants me to live with him there.

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,759
Calm down, Raga.

15
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,560
You have to support whatever Fely decides.

16
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,079
The right is gas, the left is brake.

17
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:42,200
Besides that, slowly release the brake.

18
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,640
And if anything happens...

19
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:54,679
Fely?

20
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:57,840
Honestly,

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,159
I don't know if I should be happy or not

22
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,560
that you met your father.

23
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:08,439
I am happy. Of course I'm happy.

24
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,359
But I just realized

25
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:16,560
that I can't be away from you.

26
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,640
I like you, Fely.

27
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,719
I want you to be my girlfriend.

28
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:32,799
Hello, Raga?

29
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,120
What are you daydreaming about?

30
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:40,159
Girls?

31
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,480
Right?

32
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:44,359
What are you on about? Let's start. You understand, right?

33
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,719
Gas, brake. Go slow.

34
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,719
EPISODE 12 NEW LIFE

35
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,120
Are you sure Fely will leave?

36
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,240
Yes.

37
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,879
She told me herself.

38
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,759
Can't you stop her?

39
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,879
We can't be selfish.

40
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,680
This is Fely's decision.

41
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,599
Fely?

42
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,240
Are you sure about your decision?

43
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,120
Yes, Naviro.

44
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,400
Sorry if it seems sudden.

45
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,639
But it has always been my dream to live with my parents.

46
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,960
I hope you can support me.

47
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,479
Also thank you for your support so far.

48
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:23,800
Fely?

49
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,560
Fely, I’m sorry I just got here.

50
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,839
Are you leaving now?

51
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:31,800
Yes, sir. My father will pick me up in a moment.

52
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,720
Thank you very much, sir.

53
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,480
You treated me like your own child here.

54
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,240
Your kindness has given my life a new hope.

55
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,279
Thank you very much, sir.

56
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,639
Let's keep in touch, okay?

57
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:54,160
I don't want our relationship just stop here.

58
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,720
Certainly, sir.

59
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,720
Hello.

60
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,680
I'm Andre.

61
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,000
Johan.

62
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,079
Please take good care of Fely.

63
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,240
Certainly.

64
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,000
Fely is my most beloved child.

65
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:41,519
I will definitely look after her.

66
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,959
Okay, I'll wait in the car.

67
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,319
Let me take the suitcase.

68
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,480
Excuse me, sir.

69
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:12,920
Fely.

70
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,360
Take care.

71
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:19,000
Please keep in touch.

72
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,399
Yes.

73
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,839
Be careful. Watch your feet.

74
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,279
So long everyone.

75
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,319
-What are you doing? -I could say the same.

76
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:21,360
You've been pacing since earlier, what are you thinking about?

77
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,319
Guys? Fely...

78
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,519
What is she doing now?

79
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,639
Honestly,

80
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,600
I've been thinking about her.

81
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,759
Me too!

82
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,439
You’re lying to me.

83
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,560
Hopefully Fely will be happy with her real family.

84
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,959
It's true what people say,

85
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:42,079
we feel it the most

86
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,240
if someone is valuable to us

87
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,720
when that someone is no longer with us.

88
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,120
Fely always

89
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,800
supports me.

90
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,279
I can

91
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,879
talk about cooking with her.

92
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,399
She is sincere.

93
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,079
Thanks to her, we still get along.

94
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:05,839
I remember. She forced herself to come to the record label office.

95
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,839
Even though she was having allergies at that time.

96
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,519
It turns out that letting go

97
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,439
of someone we love feels painful.

98
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,000
Do you really like her?

99
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,240
So my hunch was right.

100
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,879
Admit it.

101
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:31,439
Yes, Raga. Admit it.

102
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:34,960
Raga...

103
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,320
Wait a minute

104
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:52,799
Fely?

105
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:53,879
Hey.

106
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,320
Fely.

107
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:57,360
Wake up.

108
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,879
We have arrived.

109
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,200
Have we arrived in Surabaya?

110
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,360
Not yet. We haven't reached Surabaya yet.

111
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:08,279
Let's get out from the car first.

112
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:09,879
Come on!

113
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,879
Father?

114
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,159
Why are we here?

115
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,960
Aren’t we supposed to go to Surabaya?

116
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,399
This is a surprise from me.

117
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:40,960
I thought it would be nice if we had a vacation here first.

118
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,519
We stay here at least for three days.

119
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:46,799
Not bad, right? We can have a family time.

120
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:48,679
Thank you.

121
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,320
You're welcome.

122
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,039
Come on, let's go inside!

123
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:00,799
Please come in.

124
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,440
What a nice villa!

125
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,960
You like it?

126
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,600
I like it!

127
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,879
I want to make a video.

128
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,279
Have you seen my phone?

129
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,399
Phone?

130
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
No.

131
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,720
Where did you put it last time?

132
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:36,480
It should be in the bag.

133
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,919
It must have been left in the car.

134
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,159
I will get it later.

135
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,240
Okay?

136
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:43,919
Okay.

137
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,080
Before we rest,

138
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,120
we have dinner first.

139
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,840
Earlier, my employees

140
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,960
bought this food from a restaurant nearby.

141
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:00,159
So, don't be confused if there are lots of people here.

142
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,799
All of them are my employees who prepared this villa for us.

143
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:05,799
Here.

144
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,320
Father?

145
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,919
May I ask you something?

146
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,360
Of course. What do you want to ask?

147
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,919
What was my mom's sickness?

148
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
Fely?

149
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:43,120
I will be sad if we talk about this again.

150
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,200
I always feel guilty.

151
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,519
Can we talk about

152
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,840
something else regarding your mom?

153
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,519
My mom.

154
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,279
What kind of person was she?

155
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,240
Your mom

156
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,600
was a good person.

157
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,200
She's beautiful.

158
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:06,080
Exactly like you.

159
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,759
The thing is,

160
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,960
if she were here with us now, she would be very happy

161
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:15,120
to see you grow into the beautiful girl you are now.

162
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,879
What are you missing most about mom?

163
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:26,799
Fely,

164
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:31,159
can we talk about this another time?

165
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:34,080
I told you earlier,

166
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:37,080
I will be sad if we talk about your mom.

167
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:40,080
We're here to have fun.

168
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,879
Okay?

169
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,480
Forgive me. I didn't mean to make you sad.

170
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:46,360
That's alright.

171
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:48,360
I understand.

172
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,240
You are curious about your mom.

173
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,440
Right?

174
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,399
That's very natural.

175
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,320
And

176
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,279
I hope

177
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:04,639
our past...

178
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:06,919
Let's just forget it.

179
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:09,720
What's important now is that we're together.

180
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,559
We will have fun here, spend time together.

181
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:14,679
Right?

182
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,120
By the way,

183
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,679
tomorrow I will meet a client. Just for awhile.

184
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:25,240
After that I come back again.

185
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,039
Then we go for a walk and spend time together.

186
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:30,399
Okay.

187
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:33,159
One more thing.

188
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:36,080
I want to apologize to you.

189
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:43,320
I promise to make amends for all the mistakes that I have done to you.

190
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,200
If only,

191
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,559
I was brave enough

192
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,559
to immediately see you at the orphanage,

193
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,639
surely you won't feel lonely and sad.

194
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:03,960
I was a bad father to you.

195
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,720
Once again, I'm sorry.

196
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,399
Father?

197
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:11,960
All humans make mistakes.

198
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,919
The important thing is that we intend to fix it.

199
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,519
God Himself is the Most Forgiving,

200
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:22,080
let alone a human being like me.

201
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,960
Without you apologizing,

202
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,240
I already forgiven you.

203
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:28,200
I have now

204
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:30,600
made peace with my situation.

205
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,120
Thank you, Fely.

206
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,559
You are indeed an extraordinary child.

207
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:46,000
Stop the waterworks. Let's eat!

208
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,440
Let's eat.

209
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,480
The right one is gas. So, step on the gas slowly like this.

210
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,240
Every time you step on it, slowly release the brake.

211
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,200
And if anything happens...

212
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,519
You guys are mean!

213
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:21,879
I'm not a cheap girl.

214
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,240
I'm also not an easy girl.

215
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:25,720
Watch out!

216
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:29,279
I'll look for the one who spread the video to the ends of the world!

217
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:33,240
FELY? HOW ARE YOU? HAVE YOU ARRIVED YET?

218
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,960
LET ME KNOW

219
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,679
The room is so cute.

220
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:58,080
HAPPY HOLIDAY

221
00:16:58,799 --> 00:16:59,799
Fely?

222
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,919
I just came back from the car,

223
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:04,559
your phone isn't in the car.

224
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,759
Try to remember.

225
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:10,000
Or maybe,

226
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,359
you left it in the rest area.

227
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,920
Maybe it fell?

228
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,319
It's possible, right?

229
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,359
It's okay, don't worry.

230
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,960
I'll buy you a new phone later.

231
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,519
So, don't let the incident of losing a phone

232
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,559
ruin your mood for this vacation.

233
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:29,839
Okay?

234
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:31,599
-Yes. -Okay then.

235
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,079
I'll leave you alone.

236
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,799
Have a nice rest.

237
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,519
I think your life will be calmer,

238
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:00,839
if you

239
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:04,079
have a personal phone.

240
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,720
Nobody knows your number, except me of course.

241
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:10,720
Raga, I can't accept this phone.

242
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,039
Of course not.

243
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,079
Who gave it to you for free?

244
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:15,960
You owe me for that.

245
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:17,960
One day, I will collect it.

246
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,559
Thank you, Raga.

247
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,880

WHY THE MOUNTAIN? HAVE YOU ARRIVED AT SURABAYA?

254
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:05,680
WHY THE MOUNTAIN? HAVE YOU ARRIVED AT SURABAYA?

255
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,559
MY DAD TAKE ME TO PUNCAK

256
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,160
FOR VACATION BEFORE GOING TO SURABAYA

257
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,839

261
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,279
Fely, go to the swimming pool later, okay?

262
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,119
My employees will prepare some breakfast.

263
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,680
-Okay. -I have to go to see a client.

264
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:52,599
Just for a moment. Then I'll be right back.

265
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,680
Okay?

266
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,200
Okay.

267
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,440
That phone?

268
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,359
You've found it?

269
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,960
No. It's a spare phone.

270
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,160
Yeah.

271
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:09,720
Okay.

272
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:11,519
Okay. I'll go first.

273
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:14,400
Breakfast. Remember. Do not forget it.

274
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,480
I’m leaving now.

275
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,039
You guys watch where Fely goes.

276
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:33,119
Okay?

277
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,240
And most importantly,

278
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:36,960
who she calls.

279
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,799
Yes, Boss.

280
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,000
Yes, Boss.

281
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:00,440
Helga? Pass the jam.

282
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,000
The chocolate one.

283
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,599
Why not the sweetsop?

284
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,840
I want the chocolate flavor.

285
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,039
For your information, Fely is still at Puncak.

286
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:10,959
She hasn't arrived at Surabaya yet?

287
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,160
She...

288
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,400
She's at Puncak?

289
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,400
Why is she there?

290
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,359
She said her father took her for vacation.

291
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:28,519
It's so fun that she's on vacation.

292
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:29,680
Family time.

293
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:31,759
She has just met her own father.

294
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:37,000
I miss Fely's fried rice.

295
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,880
-You said you know the recipe? -I do.

296
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:43,680
But I'm too lazy to cook for you! Unlike Fely.

297
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,160
Let's go.

298
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,480
We’ll go to a drive thru. On me.

299
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,200
Yeah?

300
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:57,000
-Drive thru. -Really?

301
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:59,039
-Yes. -Come on.

302
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,640
Dad, I'll go first.

303
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,480
Dad, I'm leaving.

304
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,079
Dad, I'm leaving.

305
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:17,599
-Where are you? -I just arrived at the office, sir.

306
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,279
I’ll wait for you in my office, okay?

307
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:21,519
Okay, sir.

308
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:24,400
-I'll leave it to you, okay? -Okay, sir.

309
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,559
Come in.

310
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,839
Yes, sir.

311
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,200
Is there anything I can help you with, sir?

312
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,319
Rama,

313
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,720
if you have a child,

314
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,839
what could be the reason for you to leave your child in an orphanage?

315
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:49,799
Well...

316
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,839
I never did that before.

317
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,200
The reason?

318
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,640
Well...

319
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,960
In my opinion,

320
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:58,920
the first reason is because of financial difficulties, sir.

321
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,200
Second reason,

322
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,920
because the parents are not ready yet.

323
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,319
Okay.

324
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,920
But

325
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,720
are you going to wait 16 years to look for your child again?

326
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:17,359
It depends on the person, sir.

327
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,519
Excuse me, sir.

328
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,839
Are you thinking

329
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,519
about Felysia's father?

330
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,079
Andreas Geralda

331
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,640
Yes.

332
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,240
Something feels off.

333
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:33,960
I can feel it,

334
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:37,119
but I don't know why I feel that way.

335
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,640
Do you realized

336
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:44,400
that you had this particular feelings

337
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,039
it's not just because of your knowledge?

338
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,079
But because of your instincts too.

339
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,000
Then, help me.

340
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,519
Help me double-check

341
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,359
Mr. Andreas profile.

342
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,799
As detailed as possible.

343
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,640
Is he Fely's biological father or not?

344
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,519
Okay, sir.

345
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,920
Excuse me, sir.

346
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,440
By the way,

347
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:24,039
have you been honest with Fely about your feelings?

348
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:27,599
How should I tell her?

349
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:31,319
The situation was never possible.

350
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:33,000
And now she’s gone.

351
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:38,559
Honestly, I wanted to talk to her

352
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,359
before she went to Surabaya.

353
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,839
But I was afraid to disturb her focus on his father.

354
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,759
If it's not before she goes to Surabaya, then when?

355
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:51,599
He really likes Fely?

356
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,599
Don't you understand yet, Helga?

357
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:57,839
Then he's right,

358
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,839
love must be pursued.

359
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:11,279
Excuse me, sir.

360
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:13,680
This is Andreas Geralda's data that you requested.

361
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:18,960
There are 10 Andreas Geralda that I can find.

362
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I couldn't find the photos for three of them.

363
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,559
One of them, does have a child named Felysia.

364
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,599
That means Andreas

365
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,920
is Fely's biological father?

366
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:33,279
Yes, sir.

367
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,200
Thank you, Rama.

368
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,640
You're welcome.

369
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,559
Excuse me, sir.

370
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:55,119
So you’re really seeing her today?

371
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,640
Yes, as you said,

372
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,519
before she leaves for Surabaya.

373
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,960
Good luck.

374
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:02,119
Thank you.

375
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:29,839
Is this really the villa?

376
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,400
But

377
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:33,920
why are there so many thugs?

378
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:35,279
Raga?

379
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:36,920
Why you are here?

380
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,960
If my father finds out you're here,

381
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,480
he definitely won't like it.

382
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:50,160
Then he won't allow me to go anywhere.

383
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,559
Your father said that?

384
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,079
Beautiful, right?

385
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:56,200
What?

386
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,039
I said very beautiful.

387
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,480
Yes.

388
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,880
Beautiful.

389
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:03,119
What?
