SAY NO TO BULLY!

4
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:11,519
All rooms in this house get smart door locks.

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,759
This is Mini Monitor which is useful

6
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:16,640
for activating all the facilities in this room.

7
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:18,679
Good grief, is this a house or what?

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,719
Hey Mini, close the curtains.

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,679
It's really closed.

10
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,760
I can't let it go.

11
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:25,280
That's all you're capable of?

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,679
What sound is that?

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,520
One, two, three,

14
00:00:39,521 --> 00:00:40,679
four, five, six.

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,320
Wrong number.

16
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:45,439
What are you doing in front of Fely's room?

17
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:49,399
Why did the lights suddenly go out?

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,520
Fely is locked.

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,960
Earlier we heard

20
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,320
her screaming.

21
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,560
Move.

22
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,200
Four, one, two

23
00:00:58,679 --> 00:00:59,799
zero, three.

24
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:04,840
Ouch.

25
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,120
Fely?

26
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,640
Fely?

27
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:13,120
-Fely? -She passed out.

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,840
Turn on the lights.

29
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:22,480
Use whatever. Quick.

30
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:26,120
Fely?

31
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:27,239
Get up.

32
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,480
Fely?

33
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,719
-Fely? -What are you doing?

34
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:33,040
-Helga, shut up! -Not moving, what should we do?

35
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,239
You think I don't have eyes? I can see.

36
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,040
Shut up!

37
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,239
Hello, Ms. Ratih?

38
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:40,560
Ms. Ratih?

39
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:43,519
Have the fuses been checked? Looks like something went down.

40
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,280
Okay, thank you.

41
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,799
She is so quiet.

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Fely?

43
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,079
Fely?

44
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:51,239
Fely?

45
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,519
Fely, come on, get up.

46
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:54,920
If she doesn't wake up

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,239
what then?

48
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,959
She would wake up.

49
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,719
Fely?

50
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,840
Fely, wake up.

51
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,280
Fely?

52
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:27,240
Calm down.

53
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,680
The lights are back.

54
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,599
You guys are mean.

55
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,120
Guys,

56
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,680
apologize!

57
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,719
You've gone too far.

58
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,520
Only like that.

59
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,960
Besides, why do you have a phobia of the dark?

60
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,520
None of your business.

61
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,719
I just ask that you apologize.

62
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:17,919
Okay.

63
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,000
Sorry.

64
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,439
Me too.

65
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,439
Me too.

66
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,719
Fely.

67
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,680
You're okay, right?

68
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:46,879
I'm okay.

69
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,479
Thanks, Jordan.

70
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,400
Just call me Jo.

71
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:10,318
EPISODE 3 HE'S DIFFERENT

72
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,319
Dear ma'am,

73
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,079
as usual

74
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,199
those guys are always annoying.

75
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,000
Fortunately

76
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:19,319
there is one man who is very caring.

77
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,519
His name is Jordan.

78
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,240
He always helps me.

79
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:33,800
His smile made my heart flutter

80
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,079
and makes my heart more beautiful.

81
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:39,279
Is this a sign that I like him?

82
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,199
Or just amazed?

83
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,000
It's okay.

84
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:53,959
Thank you.

85
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:56,519
Good morning everyone.

86
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,839
-Morning. -Morning.

87
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,920
Good morning.

88
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,800
Fely?

89
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,720
Before going to school,

90
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,639
can I talk to you for a moment?

91
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,399
What's the matter, sir?

92
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,040
Actually

93
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:12,879
nothing serious though

94
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,199
can you not have to work there anymore?

95
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,639
If you agree,

96
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,600
I'll talk to your manager later.

97
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,839
It is nothing,

98
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,759
but I think you need to focus on your school.

99
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,720
Because Budi Dharma school is strict.

100
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,120
So that your scholarship is not in vain.

101
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,240
I promise, if

102
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:42,720
it disturbs my focus, I will resign, sir.

103
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,839
But for now

104
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:48,639
I actually still want to work there.

105
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:51,040
I am quite comfortable working there.

106
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,800
Okay then.

107
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:58,079
But don't let my naughty children

108
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,600
disturb your focus.

109
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,399
They're good with you, right?

110
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,319
Don't worry, sir.

111
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:12,319
My main focus is also school.

112
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,680
Raga? Aren't you eating together?

113
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,759
Why didn't you complain to dad?

114
00:07:58,839 --> 00:07:59,839
What?

115
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,680
Whatever your reason, thank you.

116
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,839
Naviro.

117
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,839
She deliberately didn't complain to dad.

118
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,279
So she can hold our trump card. Right?

119
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,040
I predicted it, right?

120
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,519
Whatever.

121
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,000
What are you doing?

122
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,279
How naughty!

123
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Hi.

124
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:06,919
Excuse me.

125
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,519
SUPPORT GEN-F TO REFUSE FELY

126
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,600
I'm sorry.

127
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:33,279
Sorry I was in a hurry. That's why I wasn't focused.

128
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,639
I am so sorry.

129
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,720
Just sorry?

130
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:53,080
If you dare,

131
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,480
just hit me.

132
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:01,960
You

133
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,399
shouldn't get involved.

134
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,679
Why?

135
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,399
Scared?

136
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,639
Scared?

137
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,600
Scared

138
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:24,360
of you?

139
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:27,919
If you aren't scared, what would you want to do?

140
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,399
That means

141
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,720
I don't want to deal with unimportant people!

142
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,720
-Damn you! -Stop it already.

143
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,200
Why are you fighting?

144
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:47,720
Sorry, I don't play push and shove.

145
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,519
Like a kid.

146
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,639
Let's see later.

147
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:12,240
You're so random!

148
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,799
If you walk, look around.

149
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:16,480
That's what eyes are used for!

150
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,840
He had been told.

151
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,240
Hey.

152
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,000
Our business is not finished yet.

153
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:49,519
Then finish your drink.

154
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,679
How about

155
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:56,440
you drink it?

156
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:15,039
Come on!

157
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,960
Hey, what the hell?

158
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:26,440
This is usual routine.

159
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,039
Karate practice.

160
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,679
For sports lessons later.

161
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:32,799
Right Kai?

162
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:35,000
Right?

163
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:38,360
Enough! Disband!

164
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:40,399
Hey,

165
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,279
our business isn't finished yet.

166
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,039
Come on.

167
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:58,000
Hey, do you have tissues?

168
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:01,440
Sorry, there aren't any. What about tomorrow?

169
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,519
No need. I need it now.

170
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,000
But thanks.

171
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,200
Here.

172
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,039
You need it, right?

173
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:15,039
Yeah, thanks.

174
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:50,919
Do you need it?

175
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:56,559
Do you need it?

176
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,600
Yes, I need it.

177
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:00,200
Thank you.

178
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:03,559
What's wrong with you and Naviro?

179
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,759
You guys are wet.

180
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,840
This is proof

181
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:13,559
that we are very united.

182
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,320
All right, kids. Let's get straight to it.

183
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:42,799
Open your books to page 120.

184
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:06,919
Fely? What is it?

185
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,519
Is there anything you want to ask?

186
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:35,240
Okay then. You better go to the toilet. Clean it first.

187
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,919
I'll take you, Fely.

188
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,120
-Sir? -Yes?

189
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,559
Can I take Fely to the toilet?

190
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,200
Please.

191
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,840
I don't think I've ever seen

192
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:09,840
Jordan act like that with a girl.

193
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:12,840
Correct. The Jordan we know are engrossed

194
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:14,879
in his own world.

195
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,399
Or

196
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,639
Maybe...

197
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,679
What the hell? Jordan is just nice.

198
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:25,799
Fely?

199
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,320
Want to go home together?

200
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,960
Coincidentally I was picked up today.

201
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:32,200
Don't bother, Hema.

202
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,720
I'm not going home right away. I have a work shift.

203
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:39,240
-I go first. -Yes.

204
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,120
-Be careful Fely! -Bye.

205
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:44,799
-Come on. -Bye.

206
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:53,000
Where is Raga?

207
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,879
How dare you take it.

208
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:04,400
Why?

209
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,440
-Where you get it from? -You have a towel.

210
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,680
Why are you using my tissue?

211
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:11,160
To be saved.

212
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,920
Not for use.

213
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:16,640
Why?

214
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,880
Because this is from the girl I like.

215
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:24,279
You also capable to care about girls.

216
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,759
I thought you only cared about the game.

217
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:30,279
You bastard.

218
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:33,880
Don't throw it away.

219
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:35,559
So what?

220
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,319
Is there a girl you like too?

221
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,519
So it's true?

222
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:47,240
Finally

223
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,599
there is a girl you can like.

224
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:52,400
Not just for display.

225
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,480
This one is different.

226
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:59,880
Actually, I've been paying attention to her for a long time.

227
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,359
Me too.

228
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,759
I've been watching this girl for a long time.

229
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,920
By the way, it looks like it would be fun

230
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,240
if we went on a double date.

231
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:13,519
It's rare for us to like some girls

232
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,759
at the same time.

233
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:16,960
That is true.

234
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:20,400
I'm sure I'll be dating this girl soon.

235
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,480
Me too.

236
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,200
How can we make her not feel at home with us?

237
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,960
-Fely? -Yes, who else?

238
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:30,519
Let it go.

239
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:32,720
We don't need to see her until tonight.

240
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:35,480
She is at work today.

241
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:38,359
I have an idea.

242
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,640
-Excuse me. -Yes.

243
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,680
Oh my God! Come here!

244
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,000
If you're walking, look around!

245
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:19,079
You?

246
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,440
You don't want to apologize?

247
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:24,359
Apologize! How are you walking carelessly?

248
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,440
Sir?

249
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:27,799
I am sorry.

250
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,279
Say sorry.

251
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,039
Sorry. But you're...

252
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:38,359
"You?"

253
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,039
We don't know each other.

254
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,039
No need to pretend to be close.

255
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,640
Your employees pretend to be very close.

256
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,960
Yeah. Sorry, sir.

257
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:57,759
Why is it not here?

258
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,079
-What, sir? -I lost my wallet.

259
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:03,279
You, right?

260
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:05,599
Have you taken my wallet?

261
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,680
Before coming here, I have my wallet.

262
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,920
Sir? Try to calm down.

263
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,359
Try to look carefully.

264
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,680
Maybe it fell. Maybe at the table or...

265
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:16,680
Find it quick!

266
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,680
Why is my wallet here?

267
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:29,519
Have you taken my wallet?

268
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,480
Why is it there?

269
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,759
Sorry, sir.

270
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:36,400
I will take responsibility.

271
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,359
If you want to be responsible, better fire her right now.

272
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,839
She could steal in broad daylight like this.

273
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,400
If I don't check my wallet maybe...

274
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:50,240
What should I do, ma'am?

275
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,920
Please, ma'am.

276
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,519
I didn't take the wallet, ma'am.

277
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:56,400
This is just a misunderstanding.

278
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,240
-I'm firing you. -But I'm not wrong, he is...

279
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:01,720
Never point at customers.

280
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,279
If it's not you, why is it on the tray you brought?

281
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:13,359
Looks like she took it when she hit me earlier.

282
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,079
My wallet is in my pocket, no way it suddenly fall.

283
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,960
If you don't believe it, please check the CCTV.

284
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,960
Sir, please

285
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:25,200
not to make a fuss. The culprit already caught.

286
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:27,519
And this employee has also been fired.

287
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,839
I don't want to eat here.

288
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:32,359
Guys, let's go.

289
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:03,640
That's just a teaser.

290
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,480
If you don't want something like that to happen again,

291
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,440
tonight you tell dad that you

292
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,799
refused his adoption offer.

293
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:16,799
You guys are mean.

294
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,920
This work is important to me.

295
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:25,720
As dad said,

296
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,720
you have been accepted at Budi Dharma school.

297
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,079
Just focus on school first.

298
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,160
You don't know how hard it was for me to get this job.

299
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,799
To stay in this job.

300
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,680
People like you

301
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,079
doesn't know how hard it is to earn money to survive.

302
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,400
Get in, Fely.

303
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:20,920
No need, Jo. Thank you.

304
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,319
Get in the car, Fely.

305
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:02,480
Safety first.

306
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:15,400
Naviro told me.

307
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:18,160
I am sorry. They even got you fired.

308
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,896
When I found out, I immediately looked for you.

309
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,279
Luckily I'm not far from the cafe.

310
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,799
I want to pay for all my brothers' mistakes.

311
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,240
Just take whatever clothes you want.

312
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,079
Think of it as a replacement for your paint-stained skirt.

313
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:09,400
But the price of this skirt

314
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:12,240
are not much compared to the clothes here.

315
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,920
Then consider it

316
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:19,359
a celebration of you leaving your workplace.

317
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:22,559
Have you ever heard of a resign party?

318
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,960
I also know you didn't come

319
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,160
with many clothes, right?

320
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,799
Because at that time you thought you wouldn't last long at home.

321
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,680
No. I only have a few clothes.

322
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:58,799
-Sorry, my friend was too excited. -It's okay.

323
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,519
I'll

324
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,440
try on the clothes first.

325
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,559
Did you go out with Fely?

326
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:19,039
Yes.

327
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,440
I remind you not to get close to Fely.

328
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,880
I guess

329
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,920
even though you're my brother,

330
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:28,759
I don't have to follow your words.

331
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,359
But what you do

332
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,000
affects us all.

333
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,039
Me, Naviro, Helga are tired

334
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,055
trying to make sure she doesn't feel at home here.

335
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:38,279
What you do will have an effect on Fely.

336
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:39,680
Don't you feel sorry for her?

337
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:40,960
What do you want?

338
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,560
I want you to feel sorry for her.

339
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,640
Cut it out. Calm down guys.

340
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,160
Why make a fuss over that girl?

341
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,480
She is

342
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:52,519
a stranger who suddenly lives here.

343
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:55,440
Pretend to be nice to dad to win his heart.

344
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:57,759
After that? Taking advantage of us.

345
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,160
Do you not think like that?

346
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,759
Do you want to be used?

347
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,400
If you really don't like me,

348
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:26,240
I will get out of this house.

349
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:44,759
-Why? -Pretty. Suits you.

350
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,640
You should have refused my dad's offer.

351
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,119
Because you're not part of this family.

352
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,240
Thank you for coming.

353
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:56,160
-I should thank her. -I invite her.

354
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,519
More precisely, it was the two of you who invited me here.

355
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,480
-Give it! -No!

356
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:05,359
Because you're flirtatious, attention-seeking, sassy.

357
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,720
From now on, it's better that you stay away from him.
