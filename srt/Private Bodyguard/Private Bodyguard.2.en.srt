4
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:12,039
You do know you almost hurt someone!

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,359
Almost, right?

6
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:15,080
My key. Return it!

7
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:19,000
Today we have a new student.

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,480
Hi everybody.

9
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:23,480
They are usually called the Four Prince.

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,719
Don't mess with them so you can be safe.

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,280
Mr. Johan is here to adopt you.

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,159
And let me introduce to you

13
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:35,679
my kids.

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,359
Let me introduce to you, your future sibling.

15
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,200
Seriously!

16
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,640
We came here

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,520
to get news like this?

18
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,079
This isn't real, right?

19
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,200
The four of you sit down first.

20
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,679
So that you get to know your adopted sister better.

21
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,359
Sister?

22
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,400
I only have three brothers.

23
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,400
Even if you want to adopt a child, why her?

24
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,959
Like there's no other choice.

25
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:14,799
Raga!

26
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,359
Come on, please sit down.

27
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,680
It's not right to have a stranger among us.

28
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,079
Helga, Fely is now a member of our family too.

29
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,319
Adopting a child without informing us first is called a unilateral decision.

30
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,400
Agree. We should also have a say on who the 'sister' candidate is.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,599
The one who are fun.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,280
Not the annoying one.

33
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,040
Excuse me, sir.

34
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,719
Is it better to work things out with the kids first?

35
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:03,000
Sorry, I want to go to the toilet first.

36
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,840
My necklace?

37
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,400
Why is it with you?

38
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,840
Return it!

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,400
Give it back!

40
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,719
Apart from being annoying, you are also a thief.

41
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,639
A cheap necklace like this,

42
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,479
why would I steal it?

43
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:39,599
Yes, if it's cheap for you,

44
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,719
return it.

45
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,240
I can return it.

46
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,919
I can return this necklace, as long as

47
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,520
you refuse my dad's adoption offer.

48
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,960
I will give this back.

49
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,400
You want it?

50
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,000
Fely sure took a long time.

51
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,959
We'd better just go home.

52
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,439
Just a waste of time here.

53
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,800
You should have inform us.

54
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,680
Besides, why would you adopt another child?

55
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,199
We have already grown up. Right?

56
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,600
If I want to, what's your problem?

57
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:37,480
It is my wish and your late mom's wish

58
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,040
to have a daughter.

59
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:42,920
If I have mentioned it earlier, you guys won't come here.

60
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,839
It doesn't work that way.

61
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,120
Besides, why adopt a child whose origins are unclear?

62
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,199
Helga!

63
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,600
I never taught you to speak impolitely.

64
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,959
Look? It hasn't even been an hour, yet she has ruined people's families.

65
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,399
Not even an hour.

66
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,399
Excuse me.

67
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,600
I don't

68
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,560
mean to make a commotion.

69
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:13,160
But I also have no plans to accept Mr. Johan's offer.

70
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Sir.

71
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,839
Everyone.

72
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,360
I'll go to my room first.

73
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,680
Fely?

74
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,560
-Fely? -Ms. Ida.

75
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,040
Let me do it.

76
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,519
Fely?

77
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,680
Can I talk for a moment?

78
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,720
Please, sir.

79
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:13,240
You must've feel bad.

80
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,879
Uncomfortable.

81
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:16,600
Forgive me.

82
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:19,839
No, sir.

83
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,560
They are right.

84
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,720
I am indeed a random child.

85
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,639
Maybe children like us don't deserve to have a family.

86
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,639
In my opinion,

87
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,319
it's better to just cancel this plan.

88
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,839
Don't listen to what my children say.

89
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:44,519
They need time to accept you.

90
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,439
But I'm already

91
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,160
16 years old, sir.

92
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,480
Why do you want to adopt me?

93
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,720
That's actually better.

94
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,360
Or should I adopt a baby?

95
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,560
And I think

96
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:03,600
because you are the same age as my four children,

97
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,079
it will be easier to adapt.

98
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:10,439
But why me, sir?

99
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,879
Actually, my late wife and I,

100
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:21,600
always wanted to have a daughter.

101
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:25,959
But God has other plan.

102
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,680
She passed away too soon.

103
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,680
And I

104
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,720
feel right with you, Fely.

105
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,360
As soon as I found out you were a child from this orphanage,

106
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,759
I feel

107
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:43,319
all my prayers were answered.

108
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,639
Or how about this.

109
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,759
If you're not sure yet,

110
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:55,199
we'll try to have you stay with us for three months.

111
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:58,639
If you're still unsure, I won't force you.

112
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,759
But Ms. Ida told me

113
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:07,199
that on your birthday yesterday,

114
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,360
you prayed

115
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:12,480
to have a family to adopt you.

116
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,560
Maybe this is also

117
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,879
the answer to your prayers.

118
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,000
Good evening, Master Raga.

119
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:50,559
Good evening, sir.

120
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:52,679
Good evening, everyone.

121
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,840
I don't understand our dad.

122
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,399
Why he suddenly wants to adopt a child like her?

123
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,000
I don't think it's sudden.

124
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,759
This has been his wish for a long time.

125
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,399
But still,

126
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:20,679
I don't like a stranger living with us.

127
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:24,639
How about you?

128
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,519
You're just as stubborn as dad.

129
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,279
Do you think if dad has decided,

130
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,480
is it possible

131
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,960
he'll change his mind?

132
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:50,519
KASIH IBU ORPHANAGE

133
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,720
Miss Fely, don't forget me, okay?

134
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,279
How could I possibly forget this cute little sister of mine.

135
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:31,919
Everyone,

136
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,639
my beloved brothers and sisters,

137
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,080
I can still come here, right?

138
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,600
Yes!

00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,759
KASIH IBU ORPHANAGE

140
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,559
Ms. Ida,

141
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:02,080
thank you for taking care of me for 16 years.

142
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:07,279
You always give your attention to me.

143
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,960
And love me.

144
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:16,360
You've looked after me until now.

145
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,799
I don't know how to repay your kindness.

146
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:24,559
But

147
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,039
I love you.

148
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,879
KASIH IBU ORPHANAGE

149
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:44,440
Thank you, Ms. Ida.

150
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,559
Fely and I will go first.

151
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,600
Yeah.

152
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,919
Sir, I have request.

153
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:57,080
Please take a good care of Fely

154
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:00,480
like your own kid.

155
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:02,440
Don't worry.

156
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:05,799
I will definitely take care of her like my own child.

157
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:23,279
Fely?

158
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,639
Later my children

159
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:28,679
and Ms. Ratih will help you.

160
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,440
I have to go first because I have a meeting.

161
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:32,639
Yeah?

162
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:42,440
Miss Felysia?

163
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:45,159
Yes, I'm Fely.

164
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,120
I am Ratih, the head of the domestic workers in this house.

165
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,240
Please come in, Miss.

166
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,559
Monitor, 10, 12, Miss Fely has arrived.

167
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,360
Come in.

168
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,440
Please.

169
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:35,240
Hi, Fely.

170
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:38,559
Hi, Jordan.

171
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,120
Hi all.

172
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:50,360
You rest in your room first.

173
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,080
I'll take you along with Ms. Ratih.

174
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:56,440
Let's go.

175
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,200
This is really happening.

176
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:09,360
She will stay here.

177
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:11,480
We cannot allow this.

178
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,879
I don't want to share a house with a stranger.

179
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,440
We have to make her uncomfortable

180
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,440
so she'll get out of here.

181
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:24,679
I have an idea.

182
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,600
This is the password for the door and Wi-Fi.

183
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,559
If you want to open the door

184
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,519
just press the numbers here.

185
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,559
According to the code there.

186
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,480
The number is 41203.

187
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,720
The door will automatically open.

188
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,120
If you want to go out,

189
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,559
just close the door, the door will automatically lock.

190
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,080
Isn't there a regular door lock?

191
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,200
Fely?

192
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,639
All rooms in this house

193
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,080
get a smart door lock.

194
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Good grief,

195
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,919
is this a house or what?

196
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,279
Yeah.

197
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,399
And now

198
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:58,639
this is also your house.

199
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:03,159
You're here just for momentary.

200
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:19,039
Please.

201
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,960
Ms. Ratih?

202
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,600
Who do I sleep with?

203
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:31,600
This is your own room.

204
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:33,039
There is a Mini monitor,

205
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,039
which is useful for activating

206
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,840
all the facilities in this room.

207
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,720
Hey Mini, turn off the lights.

208
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,440
Ms. Ratih, don't turn it off.

209
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:44,240
Hey Mini, turn on the lights.

210
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:46,879
What happened to you?

211
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,200
Sorry.

212
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,519
I am okay.

213
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:52,320
-Just scared. -Like a kid.

214
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,320
Fely, if you are confused

215
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:58,360
or want to ask something, don't hesitate

216
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:00,240
to ask Ms. Ratih or me.

217
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,399
Apart from that,

218
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,799
if you want to contact me,

219
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,119
press number one,

220
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,240
it will be connected to the service area.

221
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,880
I'll try it.

222
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,000
Please.

223
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,079
Hi, Mini.

224
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,359
Close the curtains.

225
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,359
It's really closed.

226
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,920
Fely?

227
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,759
You don't need to be that close to talk to the monitor.

228
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,359
Here.

229
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,079
I'm in the middle.

230
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:33,480
Hi, Mini. Open the curtains.

231
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:43,759
Okay. You'd better rest first.

232
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,440
Thank you, Ms. Ratih.

233
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,480
Thanks, Jordan.

234
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:59,240
Please rest, Miss Fely.

235
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,440
Yeah.

236
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,759
Miss Fely. Master Raga is waiting for you in the living room.

237
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:42,799
Hi.

238
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,960
Where are the others?

239
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,319
-Come with me. -Wait.

240
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,359
-Shall we wait for the others? -No need to ask too many questions.

241
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,440
Let's go!

242
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:57,119
Come on.

243
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,880
Where are we going?

244
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,696
I thought we're going to tour all the rooms?

245
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,039
Can you not be a fuss?

246
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:16,480
Just come in, sit down, and relax in the car.

247
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,519
We want to buy supplies for you. Happy now?

248
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,359
Could've just told me.

249
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,960
Why are we stopping?

250
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,880
You get off here. Wait for me. I want to find parking area.

251
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,600
You said you want to buy supplies?

252
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,519
Then wait for me here.

253
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,680
Get out!

254
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,759
Hurry!

255
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,279
Finally I don't see her face anymore.

256
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,160
Mini?

257
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Music.

258
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:00,160
Why does it have to rain?

259
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,039
Where is Raga?

260
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,160
I don't know his phone number.

261
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:08,200
Let's go home.

262
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,759
How annoying!

263
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,640
Where have you been? Leaving me on purpose?

264
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,000
-My clothes are all wet. -Why are you here then?

265
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:21,279
I was looking for you, but you weren't there.

266
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:23,799
You blame me instead of apologizing?

267
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,319
Do you really not like me that much?

268
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,839
Anyway I'm back, right?

269
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:31,799
I'm back here, right? Let's go.

270
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:33,720
Or do you want to stay here?

271
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:44,000
Hey, Fely!

272
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,160
Are you guys going to school?

273
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,680
Yes.

274
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:02,160
In that case, you just take one car.

275
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,440
So you can be together.

276
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,960
Fely?

277
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,440
You can ride with them to school.

278
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:23,119
Okay, sir.

279
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:32,839
I'll go on my own car.

280
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:34,519
I leave first.

281
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,279
Get off.

282
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,039
But this is still quite far.

283
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,319
It's close. Quick.

284
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,039
I don't want anyone to see you riding in the car with me.

285
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,279
Go!

286
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,720
Oh my God!

287
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,640
It's already 6:50 a.m.

288
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,119
What should I do?

289
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,799
Sir?

290
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,359
Sir? Please, sir!

291
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,799
Please open the gate.

292
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,480
It's still 7 a.m.

293
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:53,200
If I've closed the gate,

294
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:55,000
it means you're late.

295
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,279
You'd better go home.

296
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:19,599
Hey!

297
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,480
Oh my God!

298
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,559
Let's go to the cafeteria.

299
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:43,839
Hey, cafeteria!

300
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,200
Yes, just a moment.

301
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,960
Yeah.

302
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,880
Watch where you're going!

303
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,400
You watch yourself. You were the one who hit me first.

304
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,599
You!

305
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,640
Annoying.

306
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,279
You were very late.

307
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:07,919
All because of those annoying guys.

308
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,039
Oh well.

309
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:12,279
Come with me after school, okay?

310
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,559
-Where to? -They said

311
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,839
Raga wanted to create a content near the school.

312
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I want to go

313
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,640
but Aline couldn't make it.

314
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,519
Please accompany me.

315
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:41,880
Very crowded.

316
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,640
Raga!

317
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,720
If Raga create this content, every student want to see it.

318
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,200
Including me.

319
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,319
That's cool, Raga!

320
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:57,400
Just okay.

321
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,000
Okay.

322
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,839
Before I review this car,

323
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,799
I want to invite one of the

324
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,079
spectators here to come drifting with me.

325
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,680
Me!

326
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,880
You.

327
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:44,200
Me? Why me?

328
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,599
Let go!

329
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,599
Let me go!

330
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:50,480
I don't want to, Raga.

331
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,039
-Get in. -I don't want to.

332
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,279
You better buckle up.

333
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:58,559
Are you scared?

334
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:01,480
Okay then. Come on.

335
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:03,160
I am not scared.

336
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,359
I only ask for one thing.

337
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,920
Don't throw up in this car.

338
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,400
I'm nice, right? Taking you for a drift.

339
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:51,160
That's all you're capable of?

340
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:43,799
It's true.

341
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,319
I want to throw up.

342
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:47,200
Throw up because I'm disgusted.

343
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:49,160
Disgusted by your behavior.

344
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:53,839
If you're disgusted,

345
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,720
get out of my house quickly.

346
00:29:58,319 --> 00:29:59,920
Surely

347
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,880
I want to get out of this car quickly.

348
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,319
How is it?

349
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:17,839
Fun drifting right?

350
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:22,119
Yes, it's really fun drifting!

351
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,240
Okay guys. As I promised,

352
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:38,920
I will evaluate this car, the good and the not so good parts.

353
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,240
Let's start with the tires. Come here.

354
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,240
Fely!

355
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:52,799
What's wrong Raga?

356
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,440
I swear this Fely

357
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,200
is the most annoying girl I have ever met.

358
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:03,759
Looks like someone needs revenge.

359
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,480
My phone battery is low.

360
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:34,519
Mini?

361
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:37,000
Turn on the light.

362
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,160
Mini, turn on the light.

363
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:44,960
Help!

364
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:48,000
Turn on the light please!

365
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,960
Please open it!

366
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,720
It's so easy to scare her.

367
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:14,720
-Please open it! -Just need darkness.

368
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:18,119
I'm sorry.

369
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,039
Anyone please open it!

370
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:26,000
What sound is that?

371
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,680
Wrong number.

372
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,279
-Do you know the door code? -I don't know.

373
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,000
You caused this, Helga.

374
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:44,599
What are you doing in front of Fely's room?

375
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,000
I am so sorry.

376
00:32:57,839 --> 00:32:58,839
Here.

377
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:01,599
Yeah.

378
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:03,599
Do you need it?

379
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,079
Looks like it would be fun if we went on a double date.

380
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,400
It's rare that we like girls at the same time.

381
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,640
Apologize! How can you walk carelessly?

382
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:17,598
Sir? I am sorry.

383
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:19,240
It's better to fire her now.

384
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:21,920
If you don't want this to happen again,

385
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,839
tonight you will tell my dad

386
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,720
that you refuse his adoption offer.
