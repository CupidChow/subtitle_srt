00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:07,758
IT IS NOT TO BE FOLLOWED. VIEWER DISCRETION ADVISED.

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,039
SAY NO TO BULLY!

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,519
Thank God. I am relieved.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,640
Are you okay?

6
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:18,359
Damn it!

7
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:19,879
How could I have gotten careless?

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,440
Are you sure you want to give the money to that person?

9
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:23,960
This is for Fely's safety.

10
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:29,359
Take the money and never bother Fely and my family again.

11
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:30,719
Wait!

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,800
Fely?

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
3 DAYS BEFORE

14
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,519
Where are Raga and Jordan? They took a long time to get ready.

15
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,359
Just like a girl.

16
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,200
That's a stereotype. I'm not like that.

17
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,040
Okay.

18
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,680
Just kidding.

19
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:32,480
Andra Geralda, the fugitive in a child kidnapping case

20
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:34,439
who was arrested by the police some time ago,

21
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:38,920
is willing to cooperate with the police to dismantle the network he knows about.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Advocate expert, Eri Kuswanda, estimates that Andra will only receive a two year sentence

23
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,719
if he truly cooperates

24
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,560
That's it.

25
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,200
Don't listen to it anymore.

26
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,879
This is all in the past.

27
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,480
There she is!

28
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,799
This is the Fely I know. Irritating.

29
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,480
Adorable too, right?

30
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,439
By the way, a gift for Raga?

31
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:15,439
Please get it, okay? When choosing a gift, I get confused.

32
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,360
Is it Raga's birthday soon?

33
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:19,680
At most he would celebrate it in his auto shop.

34
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,280
MATHEMATICS AND NATURAL SCIENCES

35
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,400
MUSIC ROOM CLASSROOM 11A1, 11A2

36
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,439
Sorry.

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,719
Be careful next time.

38
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,319
It's wasteful.

39
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,159
Sorry, Raga.

40
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,199
It's alright.

41
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:45,360
Don't forget to come to my party this week.

42
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,560
Okay?

43
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,719
Thanks.

44
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,480
If you laugh there is no sound. Weird.

45
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,800
EPISODE 15 DON'T FALL FOR ME

46
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,120
That's normal for you.

47
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,399
Why are you laughing silently?

48
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:39,360
Laughter is like this.

49
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,600
Hi, Fely.

50
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,759
Can I have a moment?

51
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,800
I want to talk for a moment.

52
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,959
-Let's buy some food. -Come on.

53
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:18,959
Fely?

54
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,199
Are you still angry about that video incident?

55
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,399
You know I'm really sorry.

56
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:31,439
I know I'm not a good friend for you.

57
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,959
But for the sake of our friendship,

58
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,240
I admit that I regret doing all of those things.

59
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,600
I do not know

60
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,079
which are the truth and the lies that come out of your mouth.

61
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,800
You remember our promise, right?

62
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,959
Then what do you want me to do?

63
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,360
Maybe you can invite me to Raga's party.

64
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:10,560
It turns out you approached Fely because you want something?

65
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,120
Cut it out, Chloe.

66
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,160
Can you stay away from Fely?

67
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,839
Don't bother Fely.

68
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,959
Okay.

69
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:21,279
It's up to you if you want to believe me or not.

70
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,199
But a suggestion from your old friend.

71
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,720
Don't hope that you can have a relationship with Raga again.

72
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,480
Because you know yourself.

73
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,920
When you enter Winston's house,

74
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,600
it became a mess.

75
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,480
Besides,

76
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:40,600
people still think that you are Mr. Johan's illegitimate child.

77
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,480
Right?

78
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,399
Even though Mr. Johan only wants to help you.

79
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:50,800
But you ended up destroying him.

80
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,360
Fely? Let's go.

81
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,759
What a bummer.

82
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,879
Fely?

83
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,319
Wait.

84
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:24,360
Where are you going? I'll take you, okay?

85
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,079
No need. I can do it myself.

86
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,040
What's wrong? Why you suddenly act strange?

87
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,040
"Strange?"

88
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,600
Strange how?

89
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,840
Okay then. I'll take you, okay?

90
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,080
We're going for a walk.

91
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,080
And I promise it won't be long.

92
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:45,360
What are you thinking about?

93
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:51,879
Yesterday,

94
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:55,039
when there were rumors circulating

95
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,679
about me

96
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,639
regarding to illegitimate child,

97
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,919
how did it affect Mr. Johan's work?

98
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:06,720
Why are you thinking of that all of the sudden?

99
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,919
I'm just curious.

100
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:12,679
How is it?

101
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:18,120
Honestly, it was still bad publicity for my dad.

102
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,679
But don't worry.

103
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,559
He will definitely bounce back.

104
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:23,200
So, you don't need to worry.

105
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:24,879
Okay?

106
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,480
Fun fact,

107
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,480
eating a sweet ice cream like this

108
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:38,000
can improve your mood.

109
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,720
I know.

110
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,519
Fun fact,

111
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:48,759
if you are often stressed, your hair will turn gray quickly.

112
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:51,120
There's already one.

113
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,720
What are you doing?

114
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:55,159
Enough of the pleasantries. What do you want to talk about?

115
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,720
Fun fact, if you have problems,

116
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,360
talk to me.

117
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,879
I will definitely always try to help you.

118
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,399
Whatever that is.

119
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,879
That's what I want to convey.

120
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,039
Thank you, Raga.

121
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,639
But a suggestion from your old friend.

122
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,080
Don't hope that you will have a relationship with Raga again.

123
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:24,120
Because you know yourself.

124
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,759
When you walked into Winston's house,

125
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,559
it became a mess.

126
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,320
ANDRA GERALDA SUSPECTED OF KIDNAPPING 11 CHILDREN

127
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,600
MOST OF THEM ARE TEENAGERS

128
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:37,879
INVOLVED IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING ILLEGAL ORGAN SALES

129
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:41,159
is willing to cooperate with the police to dismantle the network he knows about.

130
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,600
Until next time, Fely.

131
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,200
Because this will not be our last meeting.

132
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:50,279
But one thing I know.

133
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,440
They put you in that orphanage

134
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:56,240
and one day they will pick you up.

135
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,480
Oh right.

136
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:03,639
I forgot that I have to meet Ms. Ida.

137
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,080
I have to go to the orphanage now.

138
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:07,320
-I'll take you. -It's okay. No need.

139
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:08,799
I can go there myself.

140
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,360
-Bye. -Fely?

141
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,399
KASIH IBU ORPHANAGE

142
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:27,279
Oh my God, Fely.

143
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:30,399
Why did you just tell me?

144
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,879
I did not expect

145
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:35,759
that Mr. Andre would be mean to you.

146
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:37,799
Andra, ma'am.

147
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,799
His name is Andra.

148
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:41,279
That's enough.

149
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,879
But

150
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,480
you're okay, right?

151
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:46,960
I'm okay.

152
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,919
Thank God.

153
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,720
But ma'am...

154
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:52,960
Honestly,

155
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,960
I feel like my presence is bringing so many trouble to the Winston family.

156
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:02,039
Even Mr. Johan's firm was affected.

157
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,519
No. This is not your fault.

158
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,840
This is because circumstances have become like that.

159
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:11,879
But Andra also said something.

160
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,440
He said

161
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:18,039
my parents always planned to take me back.

162
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:22,559
We don't know if he's lying or not.

163
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:33,279
You can't blame yourself.

164
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,679
That's not good. Okay?

165
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,679
Why won't you answer it?

166
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,000
Raga will worry about you.

167
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:55,000
Just say you're here.

168
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:00,240
I'm confused.

169
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:03,120
I don't know what to do.

170
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:06,639
I also don't want to cause more problems

171
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,320
for Raga and the entire Winston family.

172
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Fely?

173
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,600
Life is a choice.

174
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,080
It's all in your hands.

175
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,279
Now you calm down.

176
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:27,960
Ms. Ida?

177
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,279
I'm

178
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:33,679
thinking about rejecting Mr. Johan's adoption offer.

179
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:38,080
Are you sure?

180
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,480
Okay then. Let me talk to him, okay?

181
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:47,799
No need. That's okay.

182
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,399
Let me talk to him.

183
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:50,919
Thank you.

184
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,519
That's also my responsibility.

185
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:59,080
If you need anything,

186
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,080
just tell me.

187
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,120
Mr. Johan?

188
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,519
Hey, Fely.

189
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,360
What is it?

190
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:24,080
There's something I want to talk about, sir.

191
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,240
Sit down.

192
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,159
First I want to say,

193
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,759
thank you for all the opportunities you have given me.

194
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,120
But

195
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,840
I think

196
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:49,720
I don't want to continue the adoption process.

197
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:55,840
I don't know if what Andra said about my parents was true,

198
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,679
but I feel like it's true.

199
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,720
That they were planning to pick me up.

200
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:05,200
I also can't give up waiting for them.

201
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:17,159
Fely?

202
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:19,159
If that's what you want,

203
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,720
I won't force you.

204
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,399
And don't feel guilty either.

205
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:28,080
This all comes down to your decision.

206
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,120
It's not your fault.

207
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,440
Anyway, whatever your decision, I will respect it.

208
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,600
But with one condition,

209
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,440
you must continue to study at Budi Dharma

210
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:43,360
and you must not break ties with our family.

211
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,840
One more.

212
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,480
You have to come to Raga's birthday party.

213
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,240
Yes, sir.

214
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,840
The plan is, after Raga's birthday,

215
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,360
I want to go straight back to the orphanage, sir.

216
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,120
So, please

217
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,559
don't tell Raga or the others.

218
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,480
I'll tell them myself.

219
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:17,519
Jordan?

220
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,799
Come on. They are waiting for you.

221
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,759
What are we going to do here?

222
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,600
You'll see. Come on.

223
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,440
Raga?

224
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,519
You guys arrived.

225
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,319
-Congratulations. -Thank you.

226
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,680
-Happy birthday. -Thank you.

227
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,039
Hi, Fely.

228
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,200
-Fely. -Hi.

229
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,200
Thank you.

230
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,559
Hi.

231
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,200
You're so beautiful, Fely.

232
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,519
No need to use that pick up line.

233
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,720
Can I talk to you for a moment?

234
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,119
Let's talk at the front.

235
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:56,839
Okay.

236
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:12,200
Okay!

237
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:15,079
Let's try. The name on fire.

238
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,880
The birthday boy.

239
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,599
Please come forward.

240
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:22,559
Hema?

241
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Fely?

242
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,799
I want to talk to you about something.

243
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,279
I'm scared

244
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,279
if I don't talk now,

245
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:40,880
you'll suddenly left again like last time.

246
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,039
What is it?

247
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,079
Actually,

248
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:53,960
I like you.

249
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:57,559
Since the first time we met.

250
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,599
And I hope

251
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,559
you have the same feeling.

252
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,359
Where is Raga?

253
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,400
How about we call him together?

254
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,680
Raga!

255
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:20,240
Raga!

256
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,839
Raga!

257
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,400
Raga!

258
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,000
Raga!

259
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:32,079
Raga!

260
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,480
Hema?

261
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,319
Sorry, but I can't

262
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,319
return your feelings.

263
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:51,400
Because actually

264
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,240
there's already someone that I like.

265
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,799
HAPPY BIRTHDAY RAGA WINSTON

266
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:09,400
Okay. I understand. Sorry I suddenly...

267
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:12,039
No. You don't need to apologize.

268
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,839
There's nothing wrong with how you feel.

269
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,640
I've been in that position too.

270
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,240
Well, we can't choose who we want to fall in love with.

271
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:26,680
But

272
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:28,799
as time goes by,

273
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,920
if new love comes, old love will fall.

274
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,799
And new love will blossom.

275
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,160
Thank you, Fely.

276
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:43,160
But if I may ask,

277
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:44,880
who?

278
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,680
Who is the lucky man?

279
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:58,079
But promise me

280
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,559
that you wouldn't tell anyone.

281
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,759
I promise.

282
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:07,279
Okay.

283
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:15,920
Fely?

284
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,799
Why are you here? It's your birthday party.

285
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:23,119
You should be there.

286
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,216
-What's the matter with you? -I am looking for you.

287
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,720
Why are you looking for me? This is your party.

288
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:29,599
Fely, this is about

289
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,759
when I express my feelings.

290
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:35,920
Don't be awkward. I told you I will wait until whenever.

291
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,839
But don't distance yourself from me.

292
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:41,000
I can't accept you, Raga.

293
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,400
Why?

294
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:45,079
Sorry, Raga.

295
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,000
Tell me you don't feel the same way.

296
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:53,599
I can't accept you.

297
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,720
Please do not bother me anymore.

298
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:59,640
Fely?

299
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:09,039
Drive your car properly!

300
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:11,160
You do know you almost hurt someone!

301
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,799
Today we have a new student.

302
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,640
Hi, Fely.

303
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:31,599
Hi, Jordan.

304
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:33,880
Hi all.

305
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:39,839
You have a big guts to come here.

306
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,480
I'm happy to come here.

307
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,200
So that I know

308
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,799
that maybe you treat women like this,

309
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,920
because your mom doesn't have enough time to educate you properly.

310
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:58,680
Let's go home.

311
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:03,440
Irritating!

312
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:06,200
Where have you been? Did you leave me on purpose?

313
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,119
My clothes wet.

314
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,000
You don't know how hard it was for me to get this job.

315
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:12,759
To stay in this job.

316
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:14,920
People like you,

317
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,759
don't know how hard it is to earn money to survive.

318
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,359
If you really don't have

319
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,279
any feelings for Fely, I've decided

320
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,119
to approach her.

321
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:27,759
I love you.

322
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:33,839
And not as a sibling.

323
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:35,680
Or a friend.

324
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,680
I really love you, Fely.

325
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,839
I don't know what to answer.

326
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,559
I'm stupid.

327
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,079
I'm really insensitive.

328
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:10,839
I'm dumb.

329
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,680
I'm a fool.

330
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:18,599
But I want you to know one thing.

331
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,359
I really love you.

332
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,839
And I'll be the fool for you.

333
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,839
Hey.

334
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:37,039
Hey.

335
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,839
Stop it.

336
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,920
Do not cry anymore.

337
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:45,440
It hurts me to see you get hurt.

338
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,279
But it's not that simple, Raga.

339
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,079
I'll be a problem for the Winston family.

340
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,279
Fely?

341
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,680
We are in this together.

342
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:13,039
I promise I won't leave you.

343
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:22,759
-But... -Tell me

344
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,960
if you don't feel the same way.

345
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,920
And after that I promised I would go.

346
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:38,559
I...

347
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,720
I love you too.

348
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,400
I promise

349
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:23,000
I will make your life as beautiful as a butterfly.

350
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:25,640
Please give me a chance.

351
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,559
-Kiss! -Kiss!

352
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,359
Kiss!

353
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,279
Kiss her!

354
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:58,160
Are you guys official yet?

355
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,519
Congratulations guys!

356
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,880
There is

357
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,200
something that I have to tell you.

358
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:10,359
I've spoken to Mr. Johan.

359
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,200
That I've decided to reject the adoption process.

360
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,799
So, I will stay at the orphanage again.

361
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,279
I still want to wait for my parents.

362
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,559
So where do we go to celebrate?

363
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,400
You want to go back to the auto shop?

364
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:34,720
I've told the MC to continue the party without me.

365
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,480
I just want to celebrate my birthday with you guys.

366
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:46,279
How about for the special dinner,

367
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,920
I'll cook it.

368
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:49,279
Fried rice?

369
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:52,720
What else?

370
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,880
Big hug.

371
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,200
-Really? Is it crowded? -Very crowded.

372
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:10,880
Good.

373
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,799
You guys are home.

374
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,279
Tonight someone

375
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:34,839
will take this child to the surgery location.

376
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,839
Ready! Come on! Lets go!

377
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,200
It's been a long time. Come on!

378
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,839
There are still lots of scenes.

379
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:56,359
Sorry, I'm in Bekasi.

380
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,960
-So loud. -The voice is loud.

381
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:04,079
What are you doing?

382
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,240
You're always so naughty!

383
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:09,519
What else?

384
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:19,160
-I'm late. -Yes.

385
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,680
Dad will be very angry.

386
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,079
What should I do?

387
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,240
-It's not a two shots, bro! -Here. Come here.

388
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:32,799
Hopefully this medicine can make you recover quickly.

389
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,160
Although...

390
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,960
What did I said? It's a habit. Sorry.

391
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:41,680
It's a habit.

392
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,839
I'm sorry I hit you.

393
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,160
My reflex, I'm sorry.

394
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,680
Stop following me.

395
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:55,960
Just because you...

396
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,640
Action!

397
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,599
Good. Repeat.

398
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,160
Action!

399
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:10,599
Don't worry, Baby

400
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:13,880
You don't know how hard it was for me to get this job.

401
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,440
To stay in this job.

402
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,400
People like you don't know how hard it is to...

403
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:22,559
I got karma.

404
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:25,880
How can we be sure that you aren't keeping quiet about Selly?

405
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,559
Selly?

406
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,079
-Who is it? -Raga!

407
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,559
He's having a great holiday.

408
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,720
Hey, who is that?

409
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,599
Hey!

410
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:39,839
Stop!

411
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,400
Junior?

412
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:45,279
The road ends here. It's too short.

413
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:47,079
Junior? Act properly.
