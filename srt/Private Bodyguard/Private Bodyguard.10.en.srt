WARNING THE FOLLOWING CONTAIN ELEMENTS OF BULLYING.

2
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:07,758
IT IS NOT TO BE FOLLOWED. VIEWER DISCRETION ADVISED.

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,038
SAY NO TO BULLY!

4
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:11,519
Fely's rejection movement.

5
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:15,079
After confessing her feelings to Jordan, she dared to approach Raga.

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,359
What if Helga is the next target?

7
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:19,879
Naviro?

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,239
People's words are painful.

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,839
But it doesn't hurt more than a rejection.

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,960
When it comes to girls, don't be too nice.

11
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,320
Sometimes

12
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:31,760
they like to misinterpret all our behavior.

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,759
Listen to me.

14
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:41,439
Everything will be fine.

15
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:43,520
Trust me.

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,719
So,

17
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:46,600
there is one foreign account

18
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,176
that logged into the student council's account.

19
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,200
Who did it?

20
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:52,359
Chloe. Chloe did it.

21
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,680
JORDAN INCOMING MESSAGE

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,078
YOU ARE INVITED TO THE FIRST EVER CONCERT OF

24
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,359
AT BOYSROOM PLEASE COME

25
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,560
You're the first person to hear this song outside of a record label.

26
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,159
Please

27
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,680
think of this

28
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,919
as my apologies to you.

29
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,080
And I also want to say,

30
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:56,719
don't worry,

31
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,199
don't let the noises feel you.

32
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,439
You will see brighter days.

33
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,199
Better days.

34
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,240
I promise.

35
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,560
Now,

36
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,319
I really

37
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,639
didn't intend to hurt you.

38
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,839
I really don't.

39
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,079
And

40
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,720
I'm truly sorry.

41
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,360
I know you didn't mean that.

42
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,480
It is my fault.

43
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,560
Thanks for everything, Jo.

44
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,160
Don't worry.

45
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,600
I forgive you.

46
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,480
Now I consider you as my best friend.

47
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,519
Best friends

48
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,279
forever?

49
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,639
Best friends forever.

50
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,399
Don't let all the troubles get you down

51
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,959
Don't let other noises feel your eyes

52
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,879
Don't worry, Baby

53
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,720
You will see brighter days

54
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:17,079
You still have hope inside

55
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,720
You keep looking at those photos.

56
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,279
How is that possible?

57
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,120
Now he likes Fely.

58
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,240
What the hell guys?

59
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,439
I'm only looking at some pictures.

60
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,720
Come on, Raga.

61
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,600
Just express your feelings.

62
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,560
Don't be a smartass!

63
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,519
You two better go to sleep.

64
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,680
-It's late. -I don't want to.

65
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:01,279
I just want to be here waiting for Fely.

66
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,040
You guys are weird. I sleep first.

67
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:28,639
HEMA INCOMING CALL

68
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:30,959
Hello, Hema?

69
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,079
Hello, Fely.

70
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,560
Sorry if I disturbed your sleep.

71
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,839
But I have an idea.

72
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
What?

73
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,319
I have an idea

74
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,959
to make Chloe confess.

75
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:58,759
Here it is.

76
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,878
EPISODE 10 HIDDEN TROUBLES

77
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:04,879
Nice.

78
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,360
Then what is this?

79
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:09,279
I added this.

80
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:11,959
I think it would be better if that motif were present.

81
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,199
Thank you.

82
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,399
Hi, Fely.

83
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,279
Who are you going with this morning?

84
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:34,759
With

85
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,840
us.

86
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,600
Please excuse us.

87
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,840
How is it? Are you comfortable living here?

88
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,399
Once you're comfortable,

89
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:50,039
we'll talk about the next step.

90
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:54,840
Don't think about it now. Later.

91
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,840
But it doesn't feel like

92
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:59,480
you've been here for a month.

93
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,759
Yes, sir.

94
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,799
Fely?

95
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,080
Come on!

96
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,080
I'll go first, sir.

97
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,519
We're going, Dad.

98
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:30,039
Today I'm also going with Raga.

99
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,320
Okay.

100
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,039
Wait.

101
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,399
Why is Fely in the same car as them?

102
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:25,120
It's really cool for Fely

103
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,159
to share a car with Winston's kids.

104
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,240
I also want.

105
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,559
Why do you support Fely?

106
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:38,039
Okay. Before we start,

107
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,519
we will determine a workout partner, okay?

108
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,960
You're with me.

109
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,480
Come on.

110
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,159
We'll start with sit-ups.

111
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:51,840
I thought

112
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:54,879
you wouldn't be coming in today.

113
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:56,960
Of course I have to come.

114
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,679
I like your enthusiasm.

115
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:03,159
But

116
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:05,840
I don't want to check my phone for a while.

117
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:09,399
Someone sent the video again via chat app.

118
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:11,440
But that's alright.

119
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,919
Jordan and I are fine.

120
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,519
Fine, how?

121
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:20,399
Yeah. We forgive each other.

122
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,559
We agreed

123
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:26,399
that we should just be friends.

124
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,679
But honestly

125
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:30,559
I'm happier.

126
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:35,200
It seems like you have feelings for someone else.

127
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:38,360
But it's covered by your admiration for Jordan, right?

128
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,600
You could be a psychologist.

129
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:44,759
I know I'm right.

130
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,639
Okay. Let's change. Your turn...

131
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,200
Fely?

132
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:59,399
Can we talk privately for a moment?

133
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,320
Let's go to the canteen first.

134
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:06,759
Fely. Maybe he's the "someone else".

135
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:09,279
Seriously?

136
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:11,080
Come on.

137
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,960
-This is for you. -What's this?

138
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,200
Take a look.

139
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:26,399
Yeah.

140
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,320
There's a new number on the phone.

141
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,799
I think your life will be calmer

142
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:33,600
if you

143
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,039
have another personal phone.

144
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,159
Nobody knows your number except me.

145
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,120
So, you don't need to be afraid if there are

146
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,320
more bullying messages or mysterious videos.

147
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,679
Raga, I...

148
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:50,600
I can't possibly accept this.

149
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:52,279
Certainly not.

150
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,039
Who gave it to you for free?

151
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,840
You owe me for that phone.

152
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,480
One day I will collect it.

153
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,799
Okay.

154
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,879
Hi, Fely.

155
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,320
Hi, guys.

156
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,759
Excuse me, here is your order.

157
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:35,519
I didn't order this.

158
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,879
Someone said this order was to be delivered to this table for you.

159
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:40,840
Thank you.

160
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,440
If you don't want, just give it to me.

161
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:53,519
I KNOW YOU'RE THE ONE WHO UPLOADED THAT VIDEO

162
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:59,080
I'M WAITING IN THE BACKYARD

163
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,759
Where are you going?

164
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,960
Toilet.

165
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,960
I have a stomachache.

166
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,480
Enjoy the food.

167
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:39,320
So this is it?

168
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:41,399
A coward who can only blackmail people.

169
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:44,039
Aren't you the coward?

170
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,639
The video spreader behind the student council's account.

171
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,799
-Let go! It's painful! -This is nothing

172
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:00,440
compared to Fely's pain and shame.

173
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,639
Hema?

174
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,039
What the hell?

175
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:09,559
You're so strange that you defend Fely so much.

176
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:11,080
You think

177
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:12,799
people like you will confess

178
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,320
if we talk properly?

179
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,240
What do you mean?

180
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,639
No need to make small talk.

181
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:23,216
I've tracked the last IP address

182
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,375
that logged into the student council's account.

183
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,799
That's your phone.

184
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,720
Don't just make accusations.

185
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,120
You still want to deny it?

186
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:40,360
Actually, I could have kept my mouth shut.

187
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,279
-With one condition. -What?

188
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,960
Transfer 10 million to my account

189
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,600
and I will delete it.

190
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:49,840
Actually, I don't care about that video.

191
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,320
But obviously,

192
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,080
I need the money.

193
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,080
Okay.

194
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,159
Deal.

195
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,360
I know you can be trusted.

196
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,200
I trust you.

197
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:07,320
Okay.

198
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:08,960
Deal.

199
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,039
You have to believe

200
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,799
that I will share this recording.

201
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:15,519
What are you doing? Why record me?

202
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,799
Don't do that!

203
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:20,000
Relax.

204
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,279
I promise I will delete this recording.

205
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,039
But one more condition.

206
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:28,039
What condition?

207
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:30,960
You confess to Ms. Alya.

208
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,639
Then we are settled.

209
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,240
Rather than me spreading this

210
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,039
and you being slandered by the entire school.

211
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,600
Yes ma'am.

212
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,480
I recorded and uploaded the video to the student council's account.

213
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,720
Ma'am?

214
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:56,279
In my opinion, since this problem is on social media

215
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,240
the best way is to solve it on social media.

216
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,759
To solve it,

217
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,240
Chloe needs to release an apology video to Fely.

218
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:08,079
I think that's fair.

219
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,839
That can't be the case, ma'am.

220
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,920
I have admitted my mistake.

221
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,720
I agree with Hema.

222
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:19,559
Because you have spread the video on social media,

223
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,720
all students here should know

224
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:24,799
that you regret your actions.

225
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,680
So that no other students follow your actions.

226
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Okay.

227
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,920
Thank you.

228
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You can go out.

229
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,839
I admit that I was wrong

230
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,480
because I misused Budi Dharma's student council social media.

231
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:05,759
Where I uploaded video content

232
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,559
that damaged Fely's good name.

233
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,759
So I apologize to Fely and Jordan

234
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:14,079
for spreading their personal matter without consent

235
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,240
thus causing a commotion during the field trip.

236
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,519
I promise I won't do it again.

237
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,960
Thank you.

238
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:27,720
How is it?

239
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:29,680
Relieved, right?

240
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,400
Chloe?

241
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,440
Chloe?

242
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,880
I did not expect

243
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,240
that she's the bad one.

244
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:53,200
No wonder she pretends to be good.

245
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:55,599
Relax, Fely. The culprit has been revealed.

246
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,440
You won't be bullied again.

247
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:00,240
Yes. Now no one dares to bully you anymore.

248
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:03,000
You have Raga beside you now.

249
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,960
KASIH IBU ORPHANAGE

250
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,640
Chloe?

251
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,240
Hey, how are you guys?

252
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:36,440
We are fine.

253
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:38,079
You guys are big already.

254
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,160
Chloe?

255
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:41,960
Ms. Ida.

256
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,519
Gosh, you're so beautiful.

257
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:48,000
Chloe is beautiful, right?

258
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:50,519
-Yeah. -You guys play first.

259
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,359
Come on.

260
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,920
I didn't expect

261
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,119
that you still want to come here?

262
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,799
How are you?

263
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,000
Good.

264
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,640
How about your family?

265
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,559
I'm happy.

266
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,319
They really pamper me.

267
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,079
Really?

268
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,359
I'm pleased to hear it.

269
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:18,640
By the way, before Fely moved,

270
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,759
she asked about you.

271
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,319
Yes, Ms. Ida. We are in the same school.

272
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,079
Where is Fely moving to?

273
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,680
She's been adopted

274
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:33,640
by the Winston family.

275
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,359
The Winston family?

276
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,880
Mr. Johan Winston?

277
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,319
As far as I know, Mr. Johan's children also go to school at Budi Dharma.

278
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,480
Yes, that's right.

279
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,440
Fely also talked to me.

280
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:52,480
She said

281
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,240
you don't care about her

282
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,799
when you guys are at school.

283
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,960
Is that right?

284
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:01,559
No.

285
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,519
That's not it.

286
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:06,319
At that time I was busy

287
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,400
so things happened.

288
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,559
But I didn't do that.

289
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:15,279
But why does Mr. Winston want to adopt Fely?

290
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:17,960
She is 16 years old already.

291
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,720
I don't know either.

292
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:25,359
But Mr. Winston immediately liked Fely when he saw her.

293
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,799
Okay. Let me make you some drinks.

294
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,400
No need, ma'am.

295
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,119
I've got to go.

296
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:38,039
Why the rush?

297
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:40,160
You've just arrived.

298
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:42,839
I still miss you.

299
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,880
I'll come here if I have time.

300
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,359
Thank you Ms. Ida.

301
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,960
Yes, be careful.

302
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:21,799
Thank you, sir.

303
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,640
Here is the helmet.

304
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:59,640
Fely?

305
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,000
Let me carry your bag.

306
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,680
That's unusual.

307
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,000
You want something, right?

308
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,559
-Of course. I'm hungry. -So?

309
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,200
Please make fried rice.

310
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:10,839
I don't want to.

311
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,680
I'll just bring it myself.

312
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:13,880
-Let me. -No need.

313
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,240
-Is it really that good? -Yes.

314
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:18,000
I think the fried rice tastes okay.

315
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:20,640
-Let me carry it. -No need.

316
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,240
-Helga? Don't you want me cook it?

317
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:24,480
Seriously!

318
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:26,599
If I cook it, it will be delicious.

319
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,960
-Ouch. -I'm sure you'll like it.

320
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:30,559
You can't even get the ingredients right.

321
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,960
-Excuse me. -What is it?

322
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:48,559
I want to meet my manager. His name is Baim.

323
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,799
Baim has been caught by the police.

324
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,720
Are you also his victim?

325
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,880
Many people have come here

326
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,799
because they were swindled and looked for Baim.

327
00:23:59,079 --> 00:23:59,880
What do you mean?

328
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,119
He asked talented individuals for money with the promise of success.

329
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,920
But there was no news from him.

330
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,920
Thank you.

331
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,400
Hello?

332
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:40,319
Hello, Jordan.

333
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,200
I'm in Baim's office.

334
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:50,000
I was swindled.

335
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,920
Swindled?

336
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,920
Then how about Baim?

337
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,800
They said he had been arrested by the police.

338
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,960
But

339
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,799
if dad found out he would be very angry...

340
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,680
Calm down, Jordan.

341
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:08,039
We'd better think about what's best for this.

342
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,359
And I think,

343
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,319
Mr. Johan should know about this.

344
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,400
Don't worry. I will accompany you.

345
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,480
Yeah, you're right.

346
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:21,559
Thank you.

347
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:35,079
Just calm down.

348
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:37,720
Mr. Johan will definitely understand.

349
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,920
Dad?

350
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,640
Hi, Jordan.

351
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:54,119
What is it?

352
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,240
There's something I want to talk about.

353
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:01,799
What is it? Why so serious?

354
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,720
So,

355
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:16,000
I was swindled.

356
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,079
Swindled how?

357
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,720
There is an entertainment manager

358
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,119
that wanted to help me pursue a career as a musician.

359
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:26,279
We've talked and discussed it all.

360
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:29,039
And I have transferred the money to him.

361
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,880
But one day suddenly he couldn't be contacted.

362
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:33,680
Finally

363
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:35,960
I went to his office earlier,

364
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,456
and it turned out that he had been arrested by the police

365
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,039
for swindling many people and making false promises.

366
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,240
Jordan?

367
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:50,920
I send you to school so you can learn to be selective

368
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:53,359
and not to get swindled like this.

369
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:55,319
But I did this to pursue my dreams.

370
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,480
I know. But not in a stupid way.

371
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:01,319
"Stupid?"

372
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:04,079
If I'm stupid it's because I feel alone.

373
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,039
Because I do it all alone.

374
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,279
I know I'm not like Raga.

375
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,720
But everyone has their own way, right?

376
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:12,559
If I'm stupid,

377
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:15,480
it's because I didn't have anyone to guide me.

378
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,799
Maybe that's the opinion of this fool.

379
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:53,480
Jordan?

380
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:55,599
I'm sorry you were swindled.

381
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,400
I'm sorry that all this time

382
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,920
you feel less close to dad.

383
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:04,640
As your older brother,

384
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,960
I should be aware of that.

385
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:10,640
It's not your fault.

386
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:19,319
I understand what you're doing.

387
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,839
We all...

388
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:27,519
We all have our own paths to make our dreams come true.

389
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,599
But most importantly, I want you to know

390
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:32,559
that you have me.

391
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,839
You have Naviro and Helga too.

392
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,640
So, never hesitate to tell me if you have a problem.

393
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,079
Or if you need an opinion.

394
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:44,519
Okay?

395
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,000
Trust me. Dad will understand too.

396
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:49,880
Trust me.

397
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,000
Okay?

398
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:02,880
Excuse me, sir.

399
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,240
Yes, Fely.

400
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:11,960
Sorry if I'm rude

401
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:14,920
I do not

402
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,880
intends to intervene on this matter.

403
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,519
But I heard your conversation with Jordan.

404
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:27,960
Jordan has tried his best for his goals, sir.

405
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,200
Maybe Jordan didn't show it.

406
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:35,359
But I know he is very devastated because of this problem.

407
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:41,359
And the support Jordan is looking for most is the support from you.

408
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,720
Maybe she's not an illegitimate child.

409
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,240
But a child from her dad's affair.

410
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:55,799
This is a lie, right?

411
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,200
This is not true.

412
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,400
How can we be sure if you aren't being secretive about Fely?

413
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:04,440
Fely must be confused and scared now.

414
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,240
MR. JOHAN INCOMING CALL

415
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:07,759
Where is Fely now?

416
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:09,799
Did you know?

417
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,079
Who are you?

418
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:16,240
Let me introduce myself. My name is Andreas Giralda.

419
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,720
I am Felysia's biological father.
