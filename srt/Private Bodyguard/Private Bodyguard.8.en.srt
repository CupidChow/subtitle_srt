3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,039
SAY NO TO BULLY!

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,255
I notice something strange earlier.

5
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:12,320
It's not you with Jordan.

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,800
But with Raga.

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,920
Yes, you two look so close

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,719
and you even feed each other.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,800
Everything I do is to give you my full attention.

10
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:24,616
But you're busy paying attention to other girls.

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,375
It's clear there's a girl here who has liked you for a long time, Raga.

12
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:29,399
-What do you want? -What else

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,320
if not to get revenge on that girl?

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,280
Ouch!

15
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,719
How about you

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,159
express your feelings to Jordan?

17
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:39,679
I...

18
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:42,920
I like you.

19
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:53,520
Thank you

20
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,679
for having the courage to express your feelings.

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,079
I really appreciate it.

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,840
But for now, that's not my priority.

23
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:06,640
There's something else I'm pursuing.

24
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:09,040
You know that better than anybody.

25
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,719
I'm sorry

26
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,599
if my behavior so far has caused any misunderstandings.

27
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:26,400
But I did it all sincerely.

28
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,599
Got it.

29
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:14,280
EPISODE 8 LAUGHING STOCK

30
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,520
But actually

31
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:18,199
that's not all.

32
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,560
Then?

33
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,639
What else?

34
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,039
I like you.

35
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:29,400
How could Fely express her feelings first?

36
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,319
I'm embarrassed if a girl express her feelings to a boy first.

37
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:34,159
And also got rejected.

38
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,719
Why are you watching it?

39
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:39,280
Turn it off! So trivial!

40
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,479
Fely?

41
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,439
Fely?

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,800
Fely, just cry.

43
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,599
Don't hold it back.

44
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,400
It's okay.

45
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:04,360
It's okay.

46
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,279
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:33,959
It's okay.

48
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,360
I'm the one who told you to cry, remember?

49
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,959
I just want to go back.

50
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,759
I feel sorry for Fely.

51
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,279
Fely?

52
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,600
Fely?

53
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,519
Where've you been?

54
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,360
Sit down first.

55
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:14,279
We are so worried about you.

56
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,680
Be patient, Fely.

57
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,839
Love can't be forced.

58
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,680
Even if you face rejection,

59
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:21,279
there are still many other guys.

60
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,800
How do you know that?

61
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,800
We are all worried about you.

62
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:31,680
Because we saw the student council's story message.

63
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,800
It contains your confession of feelings to Jordan.

64
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,759
But actually

65
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,439
that's not all.

66
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,160
I like you.

67
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,959
Oh God.

68
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,120
I don't want to meet anyone, Shania.

69
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:57,720
I feel like I just want to disappear. Who could do that?

70
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,360
Raga?

71
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,639
Why didn't I think of Raga?

72
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,079
Raga?

73
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,600
Is Raga really going that far?

74
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,920
Okay then, don't listen to what people say.

75
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,839
Just calm your mind.

76
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,160
Get some rest, Fely.

77
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,759
Where should I put my face?

78
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:24,720
Oh God.

79
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,000
Fely?

80
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,959
Shania?

81
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:42,079
Anybody home?

82
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:43,959
-Who is it? -This is Hema.

83
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,680
What brings you here?

84
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,120
I'm bringing breakfast.

85
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:14,759
What's wrong?

86
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:15,839
This is delicious.

87
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,160
Why don't you eat it?

88
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,399
By the way,

89
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,240
I came here

90
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:27,000
because Mr. Rio told me to.

91
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:30,000
You were told to go to the village hall.

92
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,600
Why did Mr. Rio summon her?

93
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,680
About yesterday?

94
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,879
"About yesterday?"

95
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:43,199
I don't know.

96
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,879
He just asked me to tell Fely.

97
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:50,160
Fely? I'll go with you, okay?

98
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,240
No need. I can go by myself.

99
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:54,879
Let me go with you.

100
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,040
Because I was told to tell you.

101
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,480
Excuse me, Sir.

102
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,000
Yes.

103
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,319
Please sit.

104
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,560
I'm not the one who posted it.

105
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,720
"Post?"

106
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What post?

107
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:31,199
I asked you to come here

108
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,879
because I want to ask for your help.

109
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,879
Please make a report

110
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,160
on the distribution of basic necessities to residents.

111
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,879
Because I noticed you are a very thorough person.

112
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,240
What post are you talking about?

113
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,200
It's nothing, Sir. A post about the field trip.

114
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,960
But I want to take it down because the editing isn't good enough.

115
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,080
It's better not to look,

116
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:58,919
I will re-edit it, then you can take a look.

117
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,440
-I see. -By the way, Sir.

118
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:04,440
Have you seen the proposal I sent

119
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:07,279
-about the student council budget? -That's right.

120
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:09,720
I almost forgot.

121
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,879
Okay then. Your proposal?

122
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,360
I'll check it afterward, okay?

123
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,200
-Then do the report as well, okay? -Okay.

124
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,519
Alright. Please prepare the report and send it to my email, okay?

125
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,639
Okay.

126
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:24,200
What video is it, Fely?

127
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:26,519
On school social media?

128
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,440
Have you really not seen it?

129
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,360
Not yet.

130
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,080
It's even on the feeds too.

131
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,600
Feeds? Wait.

132
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,519
But actually

133
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,039
that's not all.

134
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,559
Then?

135
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:47,960
What else?

136
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,200
I like you.

137
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,360
Don't keep looking at it, Hema.

138
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,279
Hema?

139
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,840
Let me delete it.

140
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,759
I can log into the student council's account.

141
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:13,919
Thank you.

142
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,919
Luckily you're here.

143
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,720
Who did it?

144
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,919
I don't know either.

145
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,600
I don't know who recorded and posted the video.

146
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:27,440
But...

147
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,480
Who can log into the student council's social media account?

148
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,600
It could be anybody.

149
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,279
Everyone already knows the password.

150
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,679
Okay. The main thing is,

151
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:43,159
let's focus on this field trip first.

152
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,080
I promise

153
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:48,200
I will help find the culprit later.

154
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:56,360
Hema? I go first.

155
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:57,679
Thank you.

156
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,200
Fely. Shania says you're here.

157
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:05,559
No need to mince words!

158
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:08,559
Did you spread the video on the student council's account?

159
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:11,120
We didn't meet by chance, right?

160
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,720
No wonder you act nice to me.

161
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:15,120
What are you talking about?

162
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,840
I did look for you right away.

163
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,440
But to calm you down.

164
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:20,480
Because last night I saw the video.

165
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:22,559
I don't believe you anymore.

166
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:26,320
Do you really want to get rid of me from your family that bad?

167
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,120
-Your method is so mean! -Whatever.

168
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,895
You're weird for making random accusations.

169
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:32,440
If not you, who else then?

170
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,600
How am I supposed to know? What a weirdo.

171
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,399
-Has Fely's video been deleted? -It's been deleted.

172
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,240
But many accounts have reposted it.

173
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,960
Her imagination was too high

174
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,480
to express her feelings to Jordan.

175
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,720
Hi, cheap girl!

176
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:57,320
You are beautiful.

177
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,080
But I mean,

178
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,519
is it okay to express your feelings to Jordan?

179
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,240
Move. I'm going through.

180
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,159
-Wait a minute. -Gosh, how mean.

181
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,759
No wonder Jordan rejected you, you're mean.

182
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,440
It's not that.

183
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:21,120
More precisely, Jordan rejected her

184
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,840
because she wasn't on the same league, A.K.A. cheap.

185
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:29,320
What did you say just now?

186
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,639
Fely is a cheap girl.

187
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,080
-Hi! -Hi!

188
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,240
Is it okay to be that rude to a girl?

189
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,399
Shouldn't women support one another?

190
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,840
Don't think about what those mean girls said.

191
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,000
You swear that you aren't the culprit?

192
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,679
Of course not. You still don't believe me?

193
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,799
-You swear? -I swear.

194
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:14,080
How about this? If you can prove

195
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:16,240
that I posted the video,

196
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:19,399
I will comply with all your requests.

197
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:21,399
But if I can prove

198
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,399
that it wasn't me who posted it,

199
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:25,480
you will do what I ask.

200
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,879
Promise?

201
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,679
Promise.

202
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,960
By the way, I didn't post it.

203
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:38,480
Okay.

204
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:41,679
I want to go to my room to calm down.

205
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,679
I didn't post it.

206
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:15,799
Get on the bike!

207
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:19,200
I want to take you to a distant and quiet place.

208
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,960
That's what you need right now, right?

209
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:30,159
Where are you going? Come here.

210
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,720
I've closed the door. Come on.

211
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,320
Okay.

212
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,080
Get on the bike.

213
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,679
I promise you won't regret it.

214
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:53,320
Where are we going?

215
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:57,120
I told you, a distant and quiet place.

216
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,840
Don't do anything weird.

217
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:01,799
I don't want to get lost again like when Jordan and I did.

218
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,360
I'm different.

219
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,559
Raga, where are we going really?

220
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:08,960
You're so noisy.

221
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Slow down, Raga!

222
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,120
Raga. That's it. Stop!

223
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,279
Stop!

224
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,080
I just want to get off the bike.

225
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,960
This is not healing, instead, my life is in danger.

226
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,399
We are stopping.

227
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:26,840
The bike won't start. We are stopping.

228
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,600
For real. Look.

229
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:31,720
-You better get off the bike. -Is this for real?

230
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:34,000
No need to pretend.

231
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,320
What's the purpose?

232
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,080
So I can stand in the heat with you here?

233
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:41,840
You better get off the bike. Help me. Come on.

234
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,559
-The gas aren't empty yet. -Why are you speeding with this bike?

235
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:47,679
You said that you know automotive. How can this be?

236
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:49,639
This is because you are too noisy.

237
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,039
It's you who can't drive a motorbike.

238
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:54,960
Okay. Help me push!

239
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,200
Come on, help me push!

240
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,679
Let's push!

241
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:00,399
-Come on! -Come on, Raga!

242
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,120
We have arrived. Come on.

243
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,200
Come here.

244
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,200
Come on, we've arrived.

245
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:10,240
Where?

246
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:17,519
What place is this?

247
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:19,240
Very quiet.

248
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,320
A distant and quiet place, right?

249
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,639
It can be anywhere, right?

250
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,759
As long as it's distant and quiet.

251
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,600
And just in time the bike broke down here.

252
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:33,679
Ouch.

253
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,879
You just stay here for now.

254
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,200
Quiet,

255
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:49,759
calm,

256
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,279
cool.

257
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,840
Nobody will bother you

258
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,799
and nobody will see you.

259
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,319
You guys are mean!

260
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,319
You guys are mean!

261
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,160
You guys are mean!

262
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,240
I'm not a cheap girl.

263
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:26,839
I'm also not an easy girl.

264
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,240
Watch out!

265
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:31,720
I will look for the one who spread my video to the ends of the earth.

266
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,799
Finally Fely is laughing again.

267
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,319
Relieved?

268
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,799
Relieved!

269
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:45,880
Thank you!

270
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,000
You're welcome!

271
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,720
Ouch!

272
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,839
Very delicious.

273
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,279
Can I ask you something?

274
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:04,559
What?

275
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:09,039
Since when have you been living in an orphanage?

276
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:13,119
Since I was a baby.

277
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,119
Since you were a baby?

278
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:20,720
Where are your parents?

279
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,359
If I knew, why should I stay at your house?

280
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,960
I'm sorry.

281
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,240
So, you were left at the orphanage alone?

282
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,400
Yeah.

283
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,799
They said my mother talk to the previous director

284
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:45,559
that my mother just wants to leave me for a while.

285
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:48,880
But apparently she didn't come back.

286
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:51,720
And honestly

287
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:55,640
I'm still waiting for my father or mother to pick me up.

288
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,400
I know you must miss your parents.

289
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,839
Yeah.

290
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,079
That's why you're lucky.

291
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,039
You can see your family every day.

292
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:13,200
And you have to remember

293
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,160
your family

294
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,920
is your main treasure.

295
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,039
Thank you for taking me here.

296
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,079
You are right. Turns out I really needed this.

297
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:52,640
It's clear.

298
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:12,119
It's clear, Fely.

299
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,039
Thank you.

300
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,480
Fely?

301
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,200
Anyway, you're great for expressing your feelings to Jordan.

302
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:50,880
Don't think about what other people said.

303
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:55,240
Besides, who would spread

304
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:57,600
that video on the student council's social media account?

305
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,279
But don't worry.

306
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,720
The main thing is

307
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,160
I'll help you find the person who recorded the video, okay?

308
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:08,559
Thank you.

309
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:10,599
Come on, sit down.

310
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:15,440
I'm so happy you're here.

311
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,799
I came here earlier.

312
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:21,359
But you're not here.

313
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,200
Where have you been?

314
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:26,079
I left earlier.

315
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,599
Next time if you go, take me along.

316
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,319
It's boring here.

317
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:33,000
Yolanda and Miranda must be bored too.

318
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,599
Nothing to see here.

319
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:38,640
Maybe because I'm not here.

320
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,160
So, there's nothing to mock.

321
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,599
What do you mean?

322
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:47,519
They were making fun of me because of that video.

323
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,000
That's also the reason why I left.

324
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,000
Oh my God. If I were there,

325
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:57,039
I won't let that happen.

326
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,240
Really.

327
00:21:58,559 --> 00:21:59,640
I'm so sorry.

328
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,799
It's okay.

329
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,279
Earlier they had also been reprimanded by Raga.

330
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:08,200
Then I went with him.

331
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:14,000
Gosh, I forgot.

332
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:16,640
I was told to take care

333
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,279
consumption

334
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:21,000
of the campfire event.

335
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:22,839
Bye!

336
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,920
Okay.

337
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,680
Yolanda?

338
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,079
You're the campfire organizer, right?

339
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,440
Let's make Fely even more embarrassed.

340
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,000
What is Chloe doing here?

341
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,079
Just chatting.

342
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,440
She said she was bored.

343
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:03,599
After that, she encouraged me about my video.

344
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,039
Be careful. You never know if she was an enemy in disguise.

345
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:11,240
People who are friends with Miranda and Yolanda are definitely not right.

346
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,440
Chloe is actually nice. I've told you, right?

347
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:17,599
She used to be in the same orphanage with me.

348
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,039
Where were you?

349
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,319
I want to take you on a walk with Alin.

350
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:27,239
When I went to the room, you weren't there.

351
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:30,400
Earlier, Raga took me out.

352
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,559
What?

353
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:32,880
Are you serious?

354
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,119
What did he do to you?

355
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,240
Well...

356
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,640
He just encouraged me.

357
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:42,359
Really?

358
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,240
Seriously, guys!

359
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,519
But seriously, if Raga likes you,

360
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:48,720
you won't refuse him, right?

361
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,039
You're crazy if you refuse him.

362
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,200
Maybe you're just crazy.

363
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,160
Raga is the last boy in my imagination.

364
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,480
Fely?

365
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:05,440
You'll be singing at the campfire.

366
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,720
Me?

367
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,359
Please. Not me.

368
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,559
I don't know. I was just asked by the committee to convey it to you.

369
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,599
If it's possible, can you go now?

370
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:18,480
Because we're about to start the event.

371
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,359
You'll be informed about the song later.

372
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:25,759
Good evening everyone.

373
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,759
Good evening!

374
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:30,480
Let's start the event.

375
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,480
We welcome Fely with the song "Andai Kau Tahu".

376
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,160
Let's go Fely!

377
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,720
Come on Fely!

378
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,839
Sing for Jordan!

379
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,240
Sing with Jordan instead.

380
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,480
"My name is Fely, I'm brave."

381
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,480
She expressed her feelings,

382
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:11,839
but got rejected.

383
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,200
If only you knew

384
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,440
The feelings in my heart

385
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,839
Could you accept me?

386
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:37,720
In your dream!

387
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,319
If only you knew the feelings in my heart

388
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:49,000
Could it be that you love me?

389
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:50,519
You are hallucinating!

390
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:52,759
I want

391
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,759
To have you

392
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:59,359
To hold your hand

393
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,079
To kiss you...

394
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,720
Don't flatter yourself!

395
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:08,799
I feel like I have to hold back

396
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:14,480
If I end up losing you

397
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:25,200
If only you knew the feelings in my heart

398
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:30,079
Could you accept me?

399
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,880
If only you knew the feelings in my heart

400
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:43,880
Could it be that you love me?

401
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,400
I want

402
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,960
To touch you

403
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:57,000
Whispers of longing and sharing love

404
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:03,160
But I feel like I have to hold back

405
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,640
Let me oh darling

406
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,200
My love is only for you

407
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:23,400
Make sure of me moved

408
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,000
Together

409
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:31,400
As long as the full moon is there

410
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,200
Fely, let's go back. I'm sleepy.

411
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,480
Come on.

412
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,359
There's something I want to talk to you.

413
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:33,839
I didn't mean to intrude or anything.

414
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,480
Why would someone recorded that video?

415
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,799
I also don't know if there is someone who recorded it.

416
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,039
But my feelings for Fely

417
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:44,400
is the same as what I said in the video.

418
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:47,920
So,

419
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,319
you don't have any feelings for Fely?

420
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:53,799
What do you mean by asking like that?

421
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,400
If you don't have

422
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,680
any feelings for Fely,

423
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,720
I've decided

424
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:11,519
to approach her.

425
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,839
People's words are painful.

426
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:24,880
But it doesn't hurt more than a rejection.

427
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,839
If you're with girls,

428
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,000
don't be too nice.

429
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:33,400
Sometimes,

430
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:35,960
they like to misinterpret all our behavior.

431
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,160
Listen to me.

432
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:46,079
Everything will be fine.

433
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,599
Trust me.

434
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,480
So,

435
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,279
there is one external account

436
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:53,735
that is logged into the student council's account.

437
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:54,759
Who did it?
