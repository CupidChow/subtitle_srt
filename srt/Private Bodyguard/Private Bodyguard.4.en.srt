IT IS NOT TO BE FOLLOWED. VIEWER DISCRETION ADVISED.

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,039
SAY NO TO BULLY!

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,279
What are you doing?

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,880
How naughty.

6
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:17,719
As usual, those guys are always annoying.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,679
If you want to be responsible,

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,559
better to fire her now.

9
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:30,000
Luckily, there is one man who is very caring.

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,119
His name is Jordan. He always helps me.

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,159
His smile made my heart flutter.

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,960
I warn you, don't get close to Fely.

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,479
Me, Naviro, Helga, are tired trying

14
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,280
to make sure she doesn't feel at home here.

15
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:46,039
If you really don't like me,

16
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:48,200
I'll get out of this house.

17
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,600
Let go!

18
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,480
Are you not satisfied with insulting me?

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,359
Girls are like that when they get angry.

20
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,760
Scarier than me.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,439
Dear Mother,

22
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:24,680
are poor people considered despicable in the eyes of rich people?

23
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,799
But if I give up,

24
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,560
it means I lost.

25
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,599
She pretends to be good with dad, so that she can win his heart.

26
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,640
After that? Taking advantage of us.

27
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:37,239
Do you not think like that?

28
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,480
I can't lose.

29
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,439
I have to prove that Raga's words are wrong.

30
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,599
In my heart, I have no intention of taking advantage of your wealth.

31
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,480
Where's the tea?

32
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,760
Ouch.

33
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,039
What are you looking for?

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,479
Looking for tea

35
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,120
to make me relax.

36
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,520
Next time, if you need help just say so.

37
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,599
Let me make the tea.

38
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,680
Fely?

39
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,960
-Fely? -Yeah.

40
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:59,199
Thanks for treating me.

41
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,439
Thank you.

42
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,879
By the way,

43
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,840
next time, if something like that happens,

44
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:38,560
don't respond it.

45
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,960
Even though I agree,

46
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,800
sometimes they have to be scolded.

47
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,759
So, your suggestion is that I should still be nice to them?

48
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:59,479
No matter how hard a rock is, it will be crushed by water droplets.

49
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,560
Dear Mother,

50
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:42,800
today seems to be the deciding factor for me to fall in love with him.

51
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,399
Jordan.

52
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,199
His gentle voice greeted my ears tonight,

53
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:53,959
like the rhythm of a song before sleeping.

54
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,399
Miss Fely?

55
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,519
Please go to the dining room because it's time for brunch.

56
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,200
We going to visit mom's grave, right?

57
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,120
Dad said yes.

58
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,040
What's wrong?

59
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,480
Is it weird?

60
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,399
Beautiful.

61
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,600
It suits you.

62
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:46,560
Where are you going?

63
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,319
You look different.

64
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:51,879
Not going anywhere.

65
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,600
I just want to be neat.

66
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,160
There you go.

67
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,600
It doesn't hurt my eyes.

68
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,199
Not like before.

69
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:00,240
Well, thanks to Jordan.

70
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,000
He gave it to me.

71
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,759
By the way,

72
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:08,480
as a token of my gratitude,

73
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,199
I want to cook for you.

74
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:11,920
What do you want me to cook?

75
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,240
Do not bother.

76
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,480
That's okay. I want to do it.

77
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:19,600
How about fried rice? Jordan likes fried rice.

78
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,439
Really?

79
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,120
Very fitting.

80
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,959
At the orphanage, I really like cooking fried rice.

81
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,279
Okay then

82
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,319
four portions at a time.

83
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:35,080
No problem.

84
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,879
But after I cook for you,

85
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,960
you can't be annoying to me.

86
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,639
Just cook it first.

87
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,720
And you'll see.

88
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,600
Okay.

89
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:52,200
Hi.

90
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:54,240
What do you need at my stall?

91
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,080
Any special requests?

92
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:58,559
Can I cook?

93
00:08:58,639 --> 00:08:59,679
You can't.

94
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,799
In this kitchen, the one who can cook is only me.

95
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,080
Okay.

96
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,519
It looks really delicious.

97
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,799
Miss Fely.

98
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,799
Can I borrow

99
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:25,879
the cauldron? I want to cook fried rice.

100
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,320
-Let me cook it for you. -Don't. No need.

101
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,519
I want to use my recipe for the Four Prince.

102
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,200
I mean for those ugly kids.

103
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,840
Then I'll help you prepare the ingredients.

104
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,440
Okay.

105
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,919
Ta-da!

106
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,159
Who wants it?

107
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,519
This is called orphanage fried rice.

108
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:53,200
Is it really you who cooks?

109
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,480
Of course.

110
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:55,639
Okay.

111
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,440
Give it here.

112
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,440
-Are you done? -Not yet.

113
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:06,360
Don't take too much.

114
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,320
Jordan hasn't gotten the fried rice yet.

115
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,240
If it's for Jordan, it means for us too.

116
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,840
Give me the fried rice.

117
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:20,559
Here it is.

118
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,879
This is for you.

119
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,120
Thank you.

120
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,559
I'm not lying.

121
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:37,799
Delicious.

122
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:40,360
This fried rice is delicious.

123
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,399
Very delicious.

124
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,679
Don't you want to try it?

125
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,399
I lost my appetite just from seeing it.

126
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,279
Okay then. Good.

127
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Raga?

128
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:02,799
I don't know what this is made of.

129
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:05,360
But the taste is...

130
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,440
Hello.

131
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,000
-Mr. Johan? -Yes?

132
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,559
Please try it. I made this.

133
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:23,960
Really?

134
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:27,519
I'll get it for you.

135
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,440
I'll taste it.

136
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:42,279
Very delicious.

137
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I remember my late wife

138
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,840
often cooked fried rice like this.

139
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,240
After eating,

140
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,279
let's visit your mom's grave.

141
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,080
Fely?

142
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:57,360
Are you coming?

143
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,519
Dad, usually only five of us going to mom's grave.

144
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,440
Then I don't have to come, sir.

145
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,440
I want you to get to know my late wife.

146
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,320
Flora.

147
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:19,399
After eating, we'll leave.

148
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:52,320
You got a big guts.

149
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:53,559
You brave to come with us.

150
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:04,559
Please understand.

151
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,559
They are still adapting to you.

152
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,360
Furthermore, if it's about mom, they are more sensitive.

153
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,399
Alright.

154
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,399
I'm here again, darling.

155
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,919
With our children.

156
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,720
I miss you, Mom.

157
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:39,960
Mom.

158
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,279
Fely?

159
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,399
You can sow the flowers.

160
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:09,759
Darling, if you were still around,

161
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,960
you will definitely be very happy to have a daughter like Fely.

162
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,440
Fely?

163
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,759
Lead the prayer, okay?

164
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,039
Praise be to God,

165
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:37,480
please keep Aunt Flora in Your arms.

166
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,799
Give her the best place by Your side.

167
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,639
And always look after Mr. Johan and his children.

168
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,559
Amen.

169
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,639
You should have rejected my dad's invitation.

170
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,559
Because you're not part of this family.

171
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,879
You're lucky.

172
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,879
You still can come

173
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,799
to visit your mom's grave.

174
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,279
That's why

175
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,600
this should be

176
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,600
my family time.

177
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,240
I'm happy to come along.

178
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,519
So, I come to know

179
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,759
that maybe you treat women like this,

180
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:53,159
because your mom didn't have enough time to educate you properly.

181
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,919
What's going on, Vin? Good?

182
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,240
-Good Boss. -Good.

183
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:11,879
Okay then.

184
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:18,440
Raga, do you want to expand this workshop?

185
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,919
I'm looking for a new place, Dad.

186
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,639
You're great.

187
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,799
You can turn your hobby into a career

188
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,480
at your age now.

189
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,240
I'm proud of you.

190
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,519
Thank you.

191
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:33,679
I'll go first.

192
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,440
There is a meeting with a client.

193
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:37,879
Don't come home late at night, okay?

194
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:39,759
Okay.

195
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:46,440
Where are you going?

196
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:47,679
Toilet.

197
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,879
I miss Mom.

198
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,639
Do you know

199
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,679
we are calm

200
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:57,840
if we visit mom's grave.

201
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:59,639
I wish she is still here.

202
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,200
Me too.

203
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,240
-Same. -Me too.

204
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,519
Hey.

205
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,960
By the way,

206
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,720
how did you feel just now

207
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,880
when Fely comes along?

208
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,319
Definitely, we weren't the ones who invited her.

209
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,079
Dad invited her.

210
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,359
That is true.

211
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,480
Honestly,

212
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:36,079
I feel uncomfortable with Fely.

213
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:39,200
Well, I am not used to

214
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,960
having a stranger who suddenly joined.

215
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:45,640
Yeah, you're not used to it yet.

216
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,519
After a while you'll got used to it.

217
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,559
There's nothing wrong with him

218
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:52,559
uncomfortable with Fely's presence.

219
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,480
It is true

220
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,279
she is just a stranger who suddenly appeared in our family.

221
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,519
Fely?

222
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,759
Sorry to make you uncomfortable.

223
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,720
-That's not what it means. -That's what it means.

224
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,039
That's okay.

225
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:23,720
I understand.

226
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:26,240
I'll say goodbye first.

227
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,599
You don't need to worry either.

228
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,720
I won't make you feel uncomfortable anymore.

229
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,079
Because soon, I will leave your house.

230
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:03,279
Mr. Johan?

231
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,759
Where are you going, Fely?

232
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,559
I just want to go back to the orphanage, sir.

233
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,880
But it's late, Fely.

234
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,720
If you miss going to the orphanage,

235
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:24,359
I'll take you tomorrow morning.

236
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,640
I just want to go back to the orphanage.

237
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:30,920
Thank you, sir.

238
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,759
For taking me to the grave of Aunt Flora.

239
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,359
That pilgrimage was very memorable for me.

240
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,400
But

241
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:43,960
before the conflict with Helga, Naviro or Raga arises,

242
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,119
I think it's better if I just get out of here, sir.

243
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,720
Come with me.

244
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,759
There's something I want to show you.

245
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,480
Since my wife died,

246
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,400
I didn't display anything of my wife in this house.

247
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,960
Because I don't want

248
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:22,680
my children to always get reminded of their mother's absence.

249
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:24,519
But when I'm alone,

250
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,079
almost every day I watch this video

251
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,000
in memory of my wife.

252
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:32,440
Sit down, Fely.

253
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,920
Hi darling.

254
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,119
Looks like it's very busy.

255
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,920
Of course.

256
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,799
Here's to welcoming my cute baby.

257
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,079
That's why everything has to be neat.

258
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,559
Darling?

259
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,559
I want to know

260
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,599
what do you wish for our first son?

261
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,440
I wish that

262
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:06,160
our first baby boy is healthy

263
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,640
and safe.

264
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:11,720
Also be a tough guy.

265
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,119
And look just like me.

266
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:21,160
After this we'll have a baby

267
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:23,000
girl, huh?

268
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,680
You've heard it yourself, right?

269
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,480
What is my wife's wish that has not come true?

270
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:39,559
You haven't stay for three months yet.

271
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,599
I just started feeling the warmth in this house

272
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,839
since your arrival in our family.

273
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:47,079
But, sir...

274
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,559
Fely, I know

275
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,960
it's hard to get close to my children.

276
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:58,319
That's why I asked for help so that you can enter Budi Dharma.

277
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,000
So that you all can be in one house and one school.

278
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,319
Isn't it your wish to study at Budi Dharma since long time ago?

279
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,680
So, you can have lots of time to get to know each other.

280
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,640
Fely?

281
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,359
Thank you sir.

282
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,799
It turns out that you gave me opportunity to go to Budi Dharma school.

283
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:27,240
That means a lot to me.

284
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:30,119
I have long wanted to go to a top school.

285
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:33,119
Because I want the best education for you.

286
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,119
You have to be a successful person.

287
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,599
So that you can help your younger siblings at the orphanage.

288
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:43,319
And be able to find your biological parents.

289
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:49,079
But I beg you,

290
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:51,519
please

291
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,640
stay here.

292
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:57,000
At least

293
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,079
for three months as per our agreement.

294
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:03,480
If you're still uncomfortable later,

295
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:07,000
I will take you back to the orphanage myself.

296
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,720
Excuse me.

297
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:35,400
-Please. -Thank you.

298
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,440
-Thank you. -You're welcome.

299
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,240
Finally, there is a girl that you would choose.

300
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:47,839
We can go on a double date.

301
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:51,799
Same. Me too.

302
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,759
Don't fall in love to my crush.

303
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:56,200
You're the one who shouldn't like the girl I like.

304
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:57,759
Impossible.

305
00:23:57,839 --> 00:23:59,920
My tastes are much higher than yours.

306
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,359
Okay.

307
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:04,759
What's important is getting married together, right?

308
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,799
Certainly.

309
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,359
Hi.

310
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,279
Sorry you guys waited too long.

311
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:19,000
-Sit down. -Please sit.

312
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:28,160
Thank you for coming.

313
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,000
You're welcome.

314
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,160
I should be the one saying thank you.

315
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,960
I invited her.

316
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:37,119
What are you doing? I invited her.

317
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,680
More precisely, it was the two of you who invited me here.

318
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:45,400
When you invited me,

319
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,519
I deliberately chose this place.

320
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,960
So that the three of us can meet together.

321
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:57,079
So tell me. What's going on?

322
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:09,160
Everyone, let's go downstairs first.

323
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,519
I've got pizza for all of us.

324
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:13,319
Come on, quickly.

325
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,720
Please eat. Where...

326
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:26,480
Let's eat.

327
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,720
We celebrate because we managed to get Fely out of the house.

328
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:33,000
Come on.

329
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,119
Hello.

330
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:41,440
Who said that?

331
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:43,519
I will stay here.

332
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,320
You said you wanted to leave?

333
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,519
Yeah, but it doesn't happen.

334
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,759
Besides, it's up to me whether to leave or change my mind.

335
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:54,319
What a drama queen!

336
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,480
Hey!

337
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:58,279
You are the devil king.

338
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:01,799
What the hell? Hey, who let you eat?

339
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,279
Very delicious.

340
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,680
Just act normal. No need to overdo it.

341
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:13,599
Watch out!

342
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:16,319
Usually if you like to fight, later on you will love each other.

343
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:21,400
Hoax girl.

344
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,920
It was she herself said that she wanted to leave here.

345
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:26,400
Who told you to be easily lied to?

346
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:27,640
You...

347
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:35,359
Can you stop following me?

348
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:38,880
Don't follow me just because you're my twin.

349
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:41,079
Who wants to be your twin brother?

350
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,519
You just never want to give in.

351
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,599
It's rare that they fight like dogs and cats.

352
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,079
Where are you going?

353
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,400
Music room.

354
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,839
Why do you keep looking at me?

355
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,720
Don't flatter yourself. Who keeps looking at you?

356
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,400
Hi, Fely. I'll go first, okay?

357
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,160
Hey!

358
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:30,960
What are you doing? Return it.

359
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,640
-Borrow me just for awhile. -Nope. Return it.

360
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:36,759
-Two minutes. -Nope. No cheating allowed.

361
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,880
One minute. Okay, 30 seconds.

362
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,720
-Thirty seconds. -You can't cheat.

363
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:44,920
Give it back! This is mine.

364
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,799
So stingy.

365
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,519
Do your homework at home, not at school.

366
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,079
Fely?

367
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:15,160
Annoying!

368
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:23,799
Let me borrow your homework. Thank you.

369
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,799
I like Raga.

370
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:39,680
It's been a year.

371
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,319
So what does that have to do with me?

372
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,960
Obviously there is.

373
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,000
Because you're flirtatious,

374
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:51,839
attention-seeking,

375
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:53,559
sassy.

376
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:56,200
From now on, it's better that you stay away from him.

377
00:29:57,799 --> 00:29:59,079
Moreover,

378
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,720
you're just an orphanage kid.

379
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:05,599
Not suitable for Raga.

380
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:11,240
Aren't you the same?

381
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:16,279
No need to bring up the orphanage!

382
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:17,319
Quiet!

383
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,279
You start it first.

384
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,480
I didn't expect you to change like this.

385
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,440
You're like this because you want to be considered cool

386
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,799
and commensurate with them?

387
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:32,920
Is this so important to you?

388
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,400
Fely, you won't exposed me, right?

389
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,680
What do you think?

390
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,000
MY ALBUMS

391
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:47,359
ORPHANAGE

392
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,480
Why are you taking so long in the toilet?

393
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:57,240
Watch out! Did you post a picture?

394
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:58,400
Who is it?

395
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,000
Just act normal. Why is your face so pale?

396
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,400
Nothing happened.

397
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,119
Okay. You'd better go to class first.

398
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:07,920
Why are you guys so curious? Go.

399
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,160
Sassy.

400
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,480
Sorry.

401
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,759
Are you going home?

402
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:40,279
I am involved in extracurricular cheerleading.

403
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:42,880
So, what time do you come home?

404
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:44,599
Afternoon.

405
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,000
Why do you ask?

406
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,279
Alright.

407
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:52,880
Good then.

408
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:55,319
So random.

409
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,880
Hi, Fely.

410
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,319
Let's go to the field. The others are waiting to practice.

411
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,440
Okay.

412
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,799
Hi guys. Welcome to the cheerleading club.

413
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,160
Before we start,

414
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:15,000
I want us all to warm up first.

415
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:17,519
Starting with you. Count from one to eight, alright?

416
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,960
Follow the clockwise direction.

417
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,559
Okay, let's go.

418
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,680
Let's go.

419
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:25,960
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

420
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:30,319
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

421
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,240
Lastly, the feet. Let's go.

422
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:36,400
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

423
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:37,680
Let's go, guys.

424
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:41,880
Budi Dharma let's go!

425
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,759
Pay attention to the senior first.

426
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:46,880
Five, six, seven, eight.

427
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:48,839
One, two, three, four.

428
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,000
Chicken heart formation.

429
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:52,759
The key is for the flyer to look one way ahead.

430
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:55,000
Don't look down, you will be afraid of falling.

431
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:57,839
The key is that the flyer has to trust the base.

432
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,680
Four, five, six.

433
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,200
Now I want one of the juniors to try being a flyer.

434
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:08,680
I want Fely to be the one.

435
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,519
But

436
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,680
it's my first time.

437
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:15,160
If you're always afraid, when will you be able to do it?

438
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:16,680
Come on.

439
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:18,519
I'm the base. You can trust me.

440
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,960
I'm scared.

441
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,920
You have to trust me.

442
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,720
The key is trust.

443
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,519
-Okay. I'll count. -Okay.

444
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,759
-Five. -Five, six, seven, eight.

445
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:44,880
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One.

446
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,720
Hold.

447
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,279
Five, six, seven, eight, one, two, three, four.

448
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,039
Ouch.

449
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,400
Fely?

450
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,640
Climb onto me, Fely.

451
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,079
No need, Jordan.

452
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:05,880
I can walk by myself.

453
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,440
-Climb onto me, let me carry you. -That's okay.

454
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,239
Ouch.

455
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,320
But your feet hurt. Let me help you.

456
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,480
Ouch.

457
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:27,039
Wait!

458
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,000
Jordan wait.

459
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,599
Let me go.

460
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,800
I don't want to look weak in front of Chloe.

461
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,880
Open it!

462
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,320
We'll open this door in an hour.

463
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,599
Watch out if you're still fighting.

464
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:00,920
This gift is to express my feelings for you.

465
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,960
Me too.

466
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:04,760
We like you, Monica.

467
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:08,199
-This way, Fely! -This way, Fely!

468
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,239
I told you. Keep your distance from Fely.

469
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:15,039
You will destroy our plans to make her uncomfortable with us.

470
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:18,440
Chef, can you cook something that contains a lot of seafood

471
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:20,159
but it doesn't get noticed?

472
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,599
This has shrimp in it. Are you allergic to seafood?
