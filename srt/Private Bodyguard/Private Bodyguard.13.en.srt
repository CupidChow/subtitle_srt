LAST 3 EPISODES

5
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:14,359
Ms. Ida?

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,120
I've had enough of waiting for my parents to come.

7
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:20,440
I realized,

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,559
my biological parents would never pick me up.

9
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:26,359
I have to be realistic now.

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,359
I have to erase that hope.

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,920
Since when have you been living in an orphanage?

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,600
Since I was a baby.

13
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,560
Where are your parents?

14
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:47,039
If I knew, why would I stay at your house?

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,119
So, you are lucky.

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,560
You can meet your family every day.

17
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,439
And you have to remember,

18
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,960
your family is your main treasure.

19
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,159
Let me introduce myself,

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,439
My name is Andreas Geralda.

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,599
I am Felysia's biological father.

22
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:16,480
First of all, I want to apologize to you.

23
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,400
I can't

24
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:21,359
take care of you

25
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,599
and your late mother who was sick at that time.

26
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,120
We are forced to leave you here.

27
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:31,560
But now,

28
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,599
I am ready and able

29
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,519
to start a new life with the only family I had,

30
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:42,000
which is you, Fely.

31
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:48,439
Are you sure about your decision?

32
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,439
Yes, Naviro. This has always been my dream

33
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,799
to live with my biological parents.

34
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,599
Take care.

35
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,239
Please take good care of Fely, sir.

36
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,480
Certainly, sir.

37
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,120
Have you seen my phone?

38
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,440
Where did you put it last time?

39
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,040
-It should be in the bag. -It must have been left in the car.

40
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,455
It's okay, I'll get it for you later.

41
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,759
That's

42
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,759
your phone. You found it?

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,319
No, it's a spare phone.

44
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,960
You guys watch where Fely goes!

45
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,840
And most importantly,

46
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,639
who she called.

47
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:22,800
Help me double-check

48
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,639
Mr. Andreas profile.

49
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:27,319
Is he Fely's biological father or not?

50
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:29,319
It turns out that letting go

51
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,039
of someone we love is painful.

52
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:35,439
Do you really like Fely?

53
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,120
Don't you understand yet, Helga?

54
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,639
Then he's right,

55
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:40,759
love must be pursued.

56
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,520
That means Andreas

57
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,039
is Fely's biological father?

58
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:49,120
So you’re really seeing her today?

59
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,960
Yes, as you said,

60
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,879
before she leaves for Surabaya.

61
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,240
Good luck.

62
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,439
Thank you.

63
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,520
Father?

64
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:30,319
Father?

65
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,360
That's Fely.

66
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,520
Sorry, but I want to go alone.

67
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,080
If you want to go, we will go with you.

68
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,439
Your dad assigned us this job because this area is not safe.

69
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,360
It takes forever for you to answer.

70
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,439
I'm on the road.

71
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:57,000
In the car, right?

72
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,279
Yes.

73
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,399
I want to go to the mall.

74
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,639
You mall goers!

75
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,279
Instead of going to the mall, you better come visit me here.

76
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,560
Take a look.

77
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,279
Take a look.

78
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,800
Very cool!

79
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,119
It remind me of the field trip.

80
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,600
Me too.

81
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:18,519
Invite others.

82
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,040
Come visit me here.

83
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,439
Okay. Tell me the name of the villa,

84
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,800
If we have time, we'll go there.

85
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,199
But no promises.

86
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,639
Okay, but watch out if you don't come here!

87
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,319

FLORA COOPER BINTI AGUNG

89
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:56,000
I have to be honest.

90
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:59,560
I really miss Fely.

91
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,319
She's a good kid.

92
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:09,759
Fely's presence at home

93
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,959
create a different atmosphere.

94
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:16,079
Just like when you were still around.

95
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,040
But maybe this is the best decision.

96
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,879
Because she has return to her own family.

97

ANDREAS SIMATUPANG BIN PUTRA BORN JULY 11, 1975 DIED MARCH 2, 2010

ANDREAS SIMATUPANG BIN PUTRA BORN JULY 11, 1975 DIED MARCH 2, 2010

99
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,879
Rama?

100
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,120
Please confirm again if Andreas Geralda is still alive or not.

101
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,120
Okay, sir. I'll check immediately.

102
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,639
My motorcycle broke. I'll beat the auto shop owner.

103
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,480
Bring it to the other places. Bring it this afternoon.

104
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:34,440
Trisno got some money. He will treat us some drink later.

105
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,159
Is this really the villa?

106
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,080
The address is correct.

107
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:44,159
But

108
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,840
why are there so many thugs?

109
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,679
RAGA, ARE YOU COMING HERE? WHEN CAN YOU COME?

110
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:48,440
I want to talk to my dad.

111
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:50,056
I don't like being followed all the time.

112
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,000
Please do. This is your dad's order.

113
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,519
Okay. I just want to go back.

114
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,759
Ouch.

115
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,360
Fely? What are you doing?

116
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,519
Raga?

117
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,919
Why are you here?

118
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,759
Why are you climbing?

119
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,879
You drove here, right?

120
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,039
-Yes. -Let's go to the car.

121
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,480
-Okay. -Come on.

122
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Get down.

123
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:04,159
They still can see you.

124
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,799
They still can see you.

125
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,200
Don't joke around. My heart skips a beat.

126
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,576
You're cute when you heart skips a beat.

127
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,399
-Raga! -Get down again.

128
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,720
Cut it out. Come on!

129
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,799
Finally...

130
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,720
What's going on, Fely?

131
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,960
You said you want to go to Surabaya?

132
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,879
Why did you come here?

133
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:45,279
My dad said,

134
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:49,320
he wants to take a vacation first. He is meeting a client now.

135
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:52,120
I just found out that we didn't go straight to Surabaya.

136
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,639
Then why did you climb like that?

137
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:00,519
And there are lots of house guards.

138
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,279
They look like thugs.

139
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,320
My dad said they're his employees.

140
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:10,519
But it's a bit strange.

141
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:13,080
Why do they keep following me?

142
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,519
Why does my dad behave like that?

143
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:17,559
In fact, I'm sure

144
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,519
if my dad finds out you're here,

145
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:21,240
he definitely won't like it.

146
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,000
And I definitely won't be allowed to go anywhere.

147
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,440
Just think positively.

148
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:30,120
Maybe he doesn't want to lose you again.

149
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,759
But I don't feel free.

150
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,360
I feel like a prisoner.

151
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:38,639
That's enough.

152
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:40,039
Enough with the sadness.

153
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,600
It's better if we just have fun.

154
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:45,120
Especially now that you're here.

155
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:47,639
Thank you for visiting me.

156
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,879
I would definitely be bored if you weren't around.

157
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,759
So where are we going now?

158
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:59,360
It seems like there's a lake nearby.

159
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,960
Okay. Let us find it.

160
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,759
Whoever gets there first,

161
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:06,039
-gets ice cream! -Raga!

162
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,960
Gets ice cream.

163
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,879
-Okay. -Thank you.

164
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,919
-How much? -Ten thousand.

165
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,120
Yeah.

166
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:23,919
Thank you.

167
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:25,799
-Thank you. -Is it good?

168
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:32,240
Your father said that?

169
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,080
Your late mother loved all things butterflies?

170
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,720
Yes!

171
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,639
And strangely,

172
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,240
I also really like all things butterfly related.

173
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,600
I just found out that I inherited it from my mother.

174
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,600
To me,

175
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,600
the butterfly

176
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:00,679
is a symbol which reminds me

177
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,400
that one day my life will be more beautiful

178
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:06,279
and even more beautiful.

179
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,000
I like that!

180
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,880
Why are you here alone?

181
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:23,119
Why didn't you invite anyone?

182
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:30,920
Because I'm the only one who misses you.

183
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,440
Seriously? That's disgusting.

184
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:37,680
You should invite them too.

185
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,440
Beautiful, right?

186
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,400
What?

187
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:58,440
I said it's very beautiful.

188
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,359
Yes.

189
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,559
Beautiful.

190
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,119
What?

191
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:08,960
No.

192
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,279
I didn't say anything.

193
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:18,480
Here...

194
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:21,400
Let me help.

195
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,200
-Braiding? -Yes

196
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,119
Can you do it?

197
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,599
Trust me!

198
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:59,079
Just a moment, a little more.

199
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,240
Perfect.

200
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:11,200
-Is it neat? -Just check with your phone.

201
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,480
Really neat.

202
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,680
You believe me, right?

203
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:22,720
Yes.

204
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,920
If I say I like you, you believe it too, right?

205
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,319
What?

206
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,359
I like you, Fely.

207
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,240
Honestly, I don't know when this feeling grew.

208
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,640
But since you left,

209
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,000
I feel lost.

210
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,079
And I know,

211
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,799
I can't hide this feeling anymore.

212
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,079
Fely?

213
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:16,680
I love you.

214
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,480
And I don't love you as a sibling.

215
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:27,119
Or a friend.

216
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,279
I really love you, Fely.

217
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,119
Raga?

218
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,799
You know that I will move to Surabaya, right?

219
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:47,319
So what?

220
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,599
Never mind going out of town, I'll follow you abroad too, Fely.

221
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:07,240
You don't have to answer now.

222
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,599
I won't burden you with having to answer now.

223
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,599
I will wait.

224
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,599
I will make

225
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:27,880
your life much more beautiful.

226
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,480
Like a butterfly.

227
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,000
Thank you for accompanying me.

228
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:09,839
Are you sure

229
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,000
you want to go back in again?

230
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:15,599
Why should I worry about my own father?

231
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,079
If you're worried, that's okay too.

232
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:21,480
Take a look at the news, there are many

233
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:24,240
biological fathers who behave wrongly.

234
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,480
Right?

235
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,960
No.

236
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:30,599
Maybe my father is just overprotective.

237
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,079
Do you want me to come in?

238
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:34,319
Don't.

239
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,720
I'm afraid of conflict.

240
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,839
Wait.

241
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,319
What about tomorrow?

242
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:46,359
How about having lunch together?

243
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,656
I'll look for a place later. Then I share the place.

244
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,119
But we'll meet at the place.

245
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,160
Because I'm only on vacation for three days here.

246
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,880
I don't want to make a fuss.

247
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:09,559
Why are you coming too?

248
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:11,519
I want to help you climb.

249
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,079
It's useful for me to join the cheerleading extracurricular.

250
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,880
Watch out. Be careful.

251
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,759
Fely?

252
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:34,480
Are you okay?

253
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:36,400
I'm good. Nobody is here.

254
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,519
Go inside quickly. Don't get noticed.

255
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:40,640
-See you tomorrow. -See you.

256
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,279
Let me know when you get inside.

257
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:12,640
I'M IN THE ROOM NOW

258
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:18,480
THANKS FOR TODAY

259
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:25,359
SEE YOU TOMORROW

260
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,039
The child is ready to be taken.

261
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,519
Tomorrow?

262
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,559
When do you want to harvest the organs? Tomorrow, right?

263
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:53,920
Okay, it's alright if it's tomorrow.

264
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,440
The important thing is that the price doesn't change any more.

265
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:59,640
You've agreed on that price, right?

266
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:03,480
Because this is good stuff.

267
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,799
It's safe.

268
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,160
This time I guarantee it will be safe.

269
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:11,200
She is my own flesh and blood.

270
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,839
Even though she's not my child. She is just my nephew.

271
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:16,920
But she trusts me.

272
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,359
Damn it!

273
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,359
Hello, hey!

274
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,920
Fely wants to run away!

275
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,640
Yes. You guys intercept her and get her here!

276
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:37,720
Hey!

277
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:45,319
Hey!

278
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,640
Step on the brake.

279
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,480
Change the gear to D.

280
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Yes!

281
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,200
Hey!

282
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,319
-Hey. -Let's chase her!

283
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,440
Chase her!

284
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,119
Raga...

285
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,200
Oh my God.

286
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:32,039
What should I do?

287
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:37,160
Please!

288
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:39,880
Please don't hurt me!

289
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,519
No. Help!

290
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,000
-Hold her! -No!

291
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:43,839
Get inside!

292
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,000
Help!

293
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,720
That Andre is not Fely's biological father.

294
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,880
He was often in and out of prison for drugs.

295
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:58,000
He is also suspected of being involved in the human trafficking business.

296
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,519
-No! -Get inside!

297
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:10,599
Why?

298
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:12,720
Who are you?

299
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,759
Tonight someone will take this child

300
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,839
to the surgery location.

301
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:19,720
And after that,

302
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:22,920
I will pay the remaining 50 percent.

303
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,240
I'm still looking for other children.

304
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:30,839
Take the money and never bother Fely and my family again!

305
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,160
You are wanted by the police.

306
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,000
You definitely don't want to get caught.

307
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,735
We just want to give you the news.

308
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:39,200
Raga, please

309
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,359
share your location.

310
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,759
With the four of us, we can help Fely better.

311
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:44,880
If you don't tell us,

312
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,599
we will search each villa there.

313
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:49,279
Hurry, Raga!

314
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,119
Raga!
