SAY NO TO BULLY!

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,119
Who taught you to cook?

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,119
My mother taught me to cook.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,800
Are you fighting with Helga?

7
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:21,879
How could he like the same girl as me?

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,359
-Let's go, Fely! -Let's go, Fely!

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,280
I've told you. Keep your distance from Fely.

10
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,440
You could ruin our plans to make her uncomfortable.

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,839
I'm happy Fely stay in the house.

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,759
Besides, we don't have the right to kick Fely out of the house.

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,359
This gift is to express my feelings for you.

14
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:38,560
Me too.

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,640
We love you, Monica.

16
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:41,479
I'm really sorry.

17
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,799
I can't accept both of you.

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,679
Everything costs money, Jordan.

19
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:48,640
It's a lie if anyone says that building a career doesn't cost money.

20
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:49,640
Nonsense.

21
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:53,439
Can you cook something that contains a lot of seafood

22
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,200
but make sure no ones knows about it.

23
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,760
This has shrimp in it. Aren't you allergic to seafood?

24
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,200
I thought

25
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:02,240
it's an ordinary corn fritters.

26
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:19,319
Fely?

27
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:21,319
Fely?

28
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,120
Fely.

29
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,159
Fely?

30
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,680
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,040
Actually

32
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,479
I told the chef to cook the food that way.

33
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,000
But hopefully...

34
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:04,120
Hopefully this medicine

35
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,319
can make you recover faster.

36
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,960
You're actually really annoying.

37
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,879
But I shouldn't be like that.

38
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,656
-Ouch! -What are you doing in my room?

39
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,879
-Ouch! -What are you doing in my room?

40
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,840
Stop!

41
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,479
Don't think anything weird.

42
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,120
You're the weird one.

43
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,800
Why were you hugging my hand?

44
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,599
Me? Hugging your hand?

45
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,680
Impossible.

46
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:50,639
I'm serious. If you don't believe it, just check the CCTV.

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,360
You should thank me.

48
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:56,039
Is it that hard to say "thank you"?

49
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,360
You were sleeping on the sofa.

50
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,199
That's why I moved you here.

51
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,120
Who asked you to do that?

52
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,840
No one, right?

53
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,599
So, next time don't do that.

54
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,000
Just get out already. I want to sleep.

55
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,520
Is it so hard to say "thank you"?

56
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:17,199
-Instead, you are being unpleasant. -Who asked you for help?

57
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,399
Okay then!

58
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,800
Okay! Get out! Why are you here?

59
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:37,680
Medicine for your allergies.

60
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,759
So, you don't scratch it like a weirdo.

61
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,199
Wow.

62
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,439
-Wow what? -We just said "wow".

63
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,800
We just said "wow", what's wrong?

64
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,560
You guys are noisy.

65
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,615
-Ouch! -What are you doing in my room?

66
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:17,639
-Ouch! -What are you doing in my room?

67
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,720
Stop!

68
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,720
Don't think anything weird.

69
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,000
You're the weird one.

70
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,600
Why were you hugging my hand?

71
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,519
Me? Hugging your hand?

72
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,360
Impossible.

73
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:51,800
What's wrong with you Raga?

74
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:54,360
Why are you smiling?

75
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:21,079
EPISODE 6 ATTACK OF THE ENEMIES

76
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,720
Fely?

77
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,040
Fely?

78
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,519
Let's go.

79
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:32,959
Let's go where?

80
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,399
To school.

81
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,560
School?

82
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,279
-With you? -Do you want to or not?

83
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,815
If you don't want to, no problem.

84
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:39,920
Certainly not.

85
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,040
You will leave me on the road later.

86
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,120
Jordan?

87
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,879
-Are you driving to school? -Why?

88
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:50,000
-Do you want to come along? -Yeah.

89
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,160
Come on.

90
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,279
What's wrong with you guys?

91
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,079
You guys can walk!

92
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,879
Just walk!

93
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,480
Hey.

94
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,639
All of your pictures

95
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,560
are on my phone.

96
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,519
Please. I beg you.

97
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,160
Please don't spread those pictures.

98
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,480
What will you give

99
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,120
if I delete your pictures?

100
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,839
Anything. Please.

101
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,240
I promise you. Anything.

102
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,639
But please don't spread it.

103
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,480
Stop touching me!

104
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,559
Why should I

105
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:50,399
delete your pictures?

106
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,840
Otherwise, I would rather die!

107
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,919
Hey don't run!

108
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,399
Why do girls like you always cry when we only tease you a little?

109
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,720
Then you wanted to die.

110
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,720
Kai, I'm serious.

111
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,240
Please, Kai.

112
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,120
You guys have gone too far!

113
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:26,000
Hey, stay away from our business!

114
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,360
Hey, where are you going?

115
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,000
You've gone too far!

116
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:35,279
-Don't act like a coward! -What are you doing here?

117
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:38,120
Hey.

118
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,759
Do not come close.

119
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,480
What a drama queen!

120
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:43,440
If you want to jump, just jump.

121
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,080
I really understand.

122
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,679
You must feel like there is no way out.

123
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,519
But this is not the way.

124
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,799
Your life is precious.

125
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,279
I promise

126
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,960
I will definitely help you.

127
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,799
But please think about your parents.

128
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,320
Kai, please!

129
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:43,879
Please don't spread those pictures.

130
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:47,919
It'll not only embarrass me, but my parents too.

131
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:51,080
You'd better kill me than spread those pictures.

132
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
Kai!

133
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:58,399
You...

134
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,320
Go!

135
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,000
-But there are three guys. -Go take Davina.

136
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:06,119
Do you want something to happen to Davina? Hurry!

137
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,519
Come on.

138
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,240
You want to mess with us!

139
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,039
Just like that?

140
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,440
We will go to the counseling room, okay?

141
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,320
We will report it to the teacher.

142
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,720
No need.

143
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:34,279
I'll just go to the infirmary.

144
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,080
Davina?

145
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:39,679
Is your chest okay?

146
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,000
Davina?

147
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,559
Davina?

148
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:49,120
Help!

149
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:08,679
Go!

150
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:11,600
-But there are three guys. -Go take Davina!

151
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:13,639
Do you want something to happen to Davina? Hurry!

152
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,919
Fely? Want me to take you home?

153
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,535
There's no extracurricular activity today, right?

154
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,559
Okay.

155
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,399
-Fely... -Raga?

156
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,879
Come with me to the counseling room.

157
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,840
Raga? Now!

158
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,720
Raga.

159
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:13,320
He had it coming.

160
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,655
-What do you mean? -I'm not comfortable telling you.

161
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:17,240
Everyone will know later.

162
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:19,639
Hema?

163
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:23,240
I'll go home in the afternoon, I want to do my homework first.

164
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:25,639
You'd better go home first.

165
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,840
Are you sure?

166
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,240
Yeah.

167
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:29,559
Excuse me.

168
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:40,679
Excuse me, Ma'am.

169
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,159
Sit over there.

170
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,120
Please sit.

171
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,879
My purpose in calling you

172
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,440
is related to Davina's condition.

173
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,519
Davina?

174
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,480
Yes.

175
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:04,120
Currently Davina is experiencing trauma.

176
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:07,720
She no longer wants to come to school.

177
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,840
Don't let the perpetrator relax.

178
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,039
He must be punished.

179
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,279
Suspended.

180
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,399
Correct.

181
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,039
Therefore, you are suspended.

182
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:20,919
Me? Why me?

183
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:23,440
Because Davina has told everything

184
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:26,080
that you are the perpetrator, Raga.

185
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,799
Perpetrator? It's me who helped Davina.

186
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,559
Davina actually said the opposite.

187
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,759
Ma'am, I have a witness.

188
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,720
The witness is Fely.

189
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:40,039
You can call Fely here.

190
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:42,759
She will explain everything in detail and correctly.

191
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:49,759
Fely?

192
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,720
Come with me to the counseling room.

193
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,279
-Excuse me, Ma'am. -Yes.

194
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:08,600
Fely, please sit down.

195
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,720
Explain to me about Davina's problem.

196
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,879
He said you saw everything.

197
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,840
Yes ma'am. Correct.

198
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:21,159
I saw

199
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,720
Kai and Davina's commotion.

200
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,440
Kai threatens Davina, ma'am.

201
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:28,080
So, Kai started all of this?

202
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,399
Yes ma'am.

203
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,279
Even Davina was kicked by Kai.

204
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:34,279
That's a lie!

205
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,879
Fely's story is too far-fetched, ma'am.

206
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:40,120
Fely only wants to protect Raga.

207
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,759
It's obviously your low-life gang that bullies Davina.

208
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:47,639
Ma'am? How about we just check the CCTV?

209
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,399
So we can see everything.

210
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,399
There is no CCTV on the rooftop area.

211
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,120
I can prove

212
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,879
that they are lying.

213
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,159
Here it is.

214
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,199
YOU GOT TO HELP ME, KAI. RAGA IS HARRASING ME.

215
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,798
HELP ME REPORT RAGA TO MS. ALYA.

216
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,240
I DON'T DARE TO SPEAK ALONE.

217
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,200
What else do you want to say?

218
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:26,639
This is the proof.

219
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,720
This is very clear.

220
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:30,000
But ma'am, that's...

221
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,519
Because you are making it up to defend Raga,

222
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:36,200
I will suspend you both

223
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:38,320
while waiting for the next decision.

224
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,799
I will discuss this matter

225
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:42,320
with the headmaster.

226
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,799
Why am I also suspended, ma'am?

227
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,679
Kai should have been the one suspended.

228
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:48,639
Davina accused me.

229
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,000
So, just punish me. Fely doesn't need to be punished.

230
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,000
My decision is final.

231
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,879
I know who your father is.

232
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,639
But the school will not tolerate

233
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,440
this kind of action by anyone.

234
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,160
-Hello? -Hello, Jordan.

235
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,640
Everything good?

236
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,200
How about we meet at the office tonight?

237
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:30,839
-Can you? -I can.

238
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,599
I'm famous for one thing, Jordan.

239
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,200
I always move fast.

240
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,640
-Thank you. -Okay, see you later.

241
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,599
Why does Kai accuse you like that?

242
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:49,240
We've been enemies for a long time.

243
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:53,480
But the important thing is how we prove that we are not wrong.

244
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:01,880
Does anyone know

245
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,480
which hospital Davina was referred to?

246
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,920
Welcome to the team.

247
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,240
By the way, we'll re-record your demo soon.

248
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:26,720
This is some good news.

249
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,559
I've talked to one publisher

250
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,599
and they want to hear it as soon as the master demo is ready.

251
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,799
Can you do the recording next week?

252
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:35,400
I can.

253
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,680
By the way,

254
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:39,480
don't forget the costs involved.

255
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:41,039
So we can move quickly.

256
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,200
I will transfer it today.

257
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,720
Good.

258
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Congrats!

259
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,400
Anything I can help?

260
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,079
I want to visit the patient named Davina Azzahra.

261
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,160
If I may ask, who are you to the patient?

262
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,400
I'm her school friend.

263
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,400
Okay. Wait a minute, I'll check first.

264
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,039
I'm sorry, the patient Davina Azzahra could not be visited.

265
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,400
-Why? -Because information has been given here

266
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,720
that only the family can visit the patient.

267
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,599
-I see. -Yeah.

268
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:55,079
PATIENT'S FOOD FOR DAVINA AZZAHRA PAVILION ROOM 135

269
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,160
You've deleted the pictures, right?

270
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:59,279
Yes, darling.

271
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:00,799
I've deleted it.

272
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:02,920
You don't need to worry.

273
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:06,160
Remember,

274
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,359
don't go to school until Raga is expelled.

275
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:12,200
Only then will I delete the rest of the pictures.

276
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,359
But honestly, I feel bad for Raga

277
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,279
and also for Fely.

278
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,319
You don't want me

279
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,039
to spread your naked pictures again, right?

280
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,920
No I don't, Kai.

281
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:29,039
Okay.

282
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,759
I'll just follow your words.

283
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:33,440
I only want the best for us, darling.

284
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,559
You don't save the pictures on hard disk

285
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,960
or on another device, right?

286
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:39,000
How can I be that heartless to you?

287
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,559
RAGA: INCOMING MESSAGE

288
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:49,759
WHERE ARE YOU FELY? I HAVE PARKED MY CAR

289
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,200
What are you doing here?

290
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:07,279
I already said that only family can visit.

291
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,720
Earlier I saw

292
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:14,319
-my friend visiting her. -Which friend?

293
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,319
Isn't that her brother?

294
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,359
Security?

295
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,039
Security?

296
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:24,680
Where are you going?

297
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:26,240
Where are you going?

298
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:27,519
Arrest her!

299
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:30,400
Excuse me, sir!

300
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,799
She's my little sister.

301
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,200
She has mental disorder, sir.

302
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:38,160
So, sorry for the inconvenience.

303
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:43,640
Ouch!

304
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,720
You crazy girl! Let's go home!

305
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:47,799
-Ouch. -I don't want to!

306
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,799
-Excuse me, sir. -I don't want to!

307
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,400
Next time, please look after your little sister.

308
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:55,160
I'm sorry, sir.

309
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,480
Let's go home!

310
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:06,480
Thank you.

311
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,200
Kai?

312
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,160
Come with me to the counseling room.

313
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,359
Yes, sir.

314
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,440
Keep this for me.

315
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:31,319
Please sit down, Kai.

316
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:36,279
What's wrong, ma'am?

317
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,640
Remember,

318
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,759
don't go to school until Raga is expelled.

319
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:44,599
Only then will I delete the rest of the pictures.

320
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:49,039
But honestly, I feel bad for Raga

321
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,799
and also for Fely.

322
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,920
You don't want me to spread your naked pictures again, right?

323
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,839
No I don't, Kai.

324
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,920
Okay.

325
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,240
Is that true, Kai?

326
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,640
That's a lie, ma'am.

327
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,319
That's not my voice.

328
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:06,799
It must be engineered.

329
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,696
What's true is the proof of my conversation, ma'am.

330
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,920
The school has contacted Davina.

331
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,640
And assured Davina

332
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:14,839
that we would help her

333
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,960
with those pictures problem.

334
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:20,400
Because Davina has explained everything.

335
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,680
And you...

336
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:24,599
You are suspended

337
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,319
until further decision.

338
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,359
Davina's parents have also prepared a letter

339
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,079
for you to sign.

340
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,319
If at any time Davina's pictures are shared on social media,

341
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:36,759
then you have to responsible.

342
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,759
And the school has agreed to be a mediator

343
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:44,960
between your parents and Davina's parents

344
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,440
to discuss about those statement.

345
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:50,799
Ma'am, please...

346
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,000
Please don't tell my parents.

347
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:56,759
Okay. I'll sign it

348
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,240
and you can believe that I will delete all pictures of Davina in my phone.

349
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,839
But please, ma'am.

350
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,680
Please don't tell my parents.

351
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:22,359
This is for you.

352
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:26,240
Thank you

353
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:27,880
for helping me.

354
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:35,319
You're welcome.

355
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,880
I also don't want to be suspended.

356
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,400
Do you want to go home?

357
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:49,319
The others are waiting at the front.

358
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:51,920
Okay.

359
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,720
Hi guys.

360
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:19,359
Been waiting long?

361
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,240
-We go now? -Let's go.

362
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:25,759
What?

363
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:27,359
Who is she?

364
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,160
How can she share a car with Helga?

365
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:31,960
I've never been.

366
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:33,880
This cannot be allowed.

367
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,039
I agree.

368
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:36,759
Trying to act pretty!

369
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,839
She is pretty though.

370
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,880
What are you doing?

371
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,279
Hey, wait!

372
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:46,799
-What? -Calm down, will you?

373
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,960
Next week we have a field trip, right?

374
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,519
Yes. Why?

375
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,559
Why are you suddenly talking like that?

376
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:07,759
I think, if you really like him,

377
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:10,359
how about you

378
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,359
express your feelings to Jordan?

379
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,720
Are you with Jordan or Fely?

380
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:16,640
They haven't come back yet. They also didn't answer the phone.

381
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:17,960
Maybe with their friends.

382
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:20,160
Looks like this way. Is it correct?

383
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,480
No. Jordan is with Fely.

384
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,200
Why are you asking us then?

385
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,119
Ouch.

386
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:29,559
Don't be stupid!

387
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:32,160
Jordan?

388
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,599
Run, Fely!

389
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,960
Fely?
