It's already late. I'll wake up the kids first.

11
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,840
Yes, Miss.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,840
Loly, come on, get up. It's already noon.

13
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:23,840
Bunga?

14
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,719
Wake up. It's noon already.

15
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,120
Alya? Wake up.

16
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,799
It's Saturday, Miss.

17
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:31,879
Come here.

18
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:35,359
If you wake up early

19
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,239
then you'll have more time to play, right?

20
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,319
Get up.

21
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,519
Look? Dino just woke up.

22
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,040
Of course.

23
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,159
Miss Fely, you're cooking fried rice for me today right?

24
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:53,239
You promised to cook fried rice today.

25
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:55,239
I don't want bread all the time.

26
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,960
Let's eat.

27
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,120
Get in line.

28
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,800
-Where's mine? -Okay.

29
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,360
Here it is.

30
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,039
Wait a second.

31
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,560
I go first.

32
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,319
RESTAURANT SHIFT 2:30 P.M.

33
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,879
-Hi Miss Fely. -Hi.

34
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,159
Hi.

35
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,360
Oh my God.

36
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,560
Ms. Ida, I'll go first.

37
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,319
-Why the rush? -Because it's already late.

38
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,919
Okay then. Be careful.

39
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,400
-Peace be upon you. -And peace be upon you.

40
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,680
Sir!

00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,719
RESTAURANT SHIFT 2:30 P.M.

42
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,920
Where have you been?

43
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,120
You didn't answer my call.

44
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,480
Change your clothes. Wipe off the sweat.

45
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,720
Yes ma'am.

46
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,959
-Mr. Johan has been waiting for you. -Yes ma'am.

47
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,680
Keyla.

48
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,360
Hello, sir.

49
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:22,680
-Sorry for the wait, sir. -That's okay.

50
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:25,319
-The order as usual? -Of course.

51
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:26,639
Okay.

52
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,439
Fely?

53
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,160
How do I look?

54
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,079
Who are you meeting with today, sir?

55
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,519
I want to meet an important witness.

56
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,639
He is still young. Maybe just a few years above you.

57
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,120
In my opinion, it's your hair, sir.

58
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,120
It's better to comb your hair to the right.

59
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,680
Then let it fall,

60
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:56,120
so it's more casual.

61
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,639
Especially if your aim is to keep your distance from this witness.

62
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:02,879
Okay.

63
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,519
That's nice input.

64
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,439
Thank you, Fely.

65
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,199
-You're welcome. -Thank you.

66
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,120
Sir, I want to ask.

67
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:17,240
For the past six months, you have always asked me about your appearance.

68
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:20,879
Is there no one at home you can ask?

69
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,399
My children are all boys.

70
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,319
How could they care about appearance?

71
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
And my wife

72
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:32,199
died a long time ago.

73
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,160
I'm sorry sir.

74
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,240
It's okay.

75
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,079
I'm happy to get a good input from you.

76
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,959
Thank you.

Happy Birthday, Miss Fely!

83
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:17,800
Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday!

Happy Birthday, Miss Fely!

85
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,800
Alya, Dino, Bunga, Loly, Adrian,

86
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:31,160
why are you celebrating it here?

87
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,360
Because every time we celebrate at the orphanage,

88
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,040
you always sad.

89
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,639
Ms. Ida said,

90
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,439
it makes you think of your parents.

91
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:42,759
That's why we celebrate here

92
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,759
so that you won't be sad.

93
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,639
Thank you.

94
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,199
What is this?

95
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,560
Fely? Tell them to get out.

96
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:59,279
They're your younger siblings from the orphanage?

97
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,480
It was my fault that I accepted employees

98
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,040
from an orphanage like you.

99
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,800
You don't follow rules.

100
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,720
You can only cause problems.

101
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,040
Coming late.

102
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,240
Have a random event like this.

103
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,920
This is working hours. Understand?

104
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,639
It's good that I still welcome you here.

105
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,759
I'm sorry, ma'am.

106
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,720
Forgive my siblings too.

107
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,800
They just want to surprise me.

108
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,680
I don't want something like this to happen again.

109
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,360
Happy birthday, Fely.

110
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,720
Thank you, sir.

111
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:40,879
Why the birthday employee got scolded?

112
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,720
No.

113
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:49,080
Surprise! You misunderstand.

114
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:52,039
Fely, how is it? My surprise worked?

115
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:54,159
I just pretended to be angry.

116
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,799
Yes, right? Happy birthday, Fely.

117
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:01,279
I pray for you every day.

118
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,679
Come on.

119
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,080
Be careful.

120
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,200
Can you?

121
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:24,080
You guys

122
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:27,039
disobeying me. I already said that you can't go

123
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,480
but you still went ahead.

124
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,799
Look? Miss Fely got scolded, right?

125
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:34,480
Sorry ma'am. We promise it won't be like that again.

126
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:35,799
Really?

127
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,080
Really?

128
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,559
Yes.

129
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,120
Okay then.

130
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,639
Now go to the back to change clothes, wash your feet and your hands.

131
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:50,000
-Ma'am, this is Mr. Johan. -Yes.

132
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,639
Ma'am, I'm Johan.

133
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,200
Ida.

134
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,320
Sir?

135
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,559
Thank you

136
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,639
for taking me and my siblings home.

137
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,240
This is Ms. Ida, the head of the orphanage here.

138
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:08,360
Thank you again for taking the kids home.

139
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,360
-Sorry if it's a bother. -You're welcome, Ms. Ida.

140
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,600
I'll say goodbye first.

141
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,200
Thank you.

142
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,639
-Excuse me. -Yes.

143
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,519
Come on.

00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,000
KASIH IBU ORPHANAGE

145
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,679
Fely?

146
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:51,360
Who send this gift, ma'am?

147
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,120
Chloe?

148
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:56,039
No.

149
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,200
That's from me.

150
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,559
I'm sorry.

151
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:02,720
I can only give that.

152
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,039
Why are you sorry?

153
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,960
All this time I have troubled you a lot.

154
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:18,000
I have to quickly become independent.

155
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,480
So that I don't become a burden to this orphanage.

156
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,759
No. You're not a burden.

157
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,200
Ma'am?

158
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,960
I've had enough of waiting for my parents to come.

159
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,320
I realized

160
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:35,879
my biological parents won't pick me up.

161
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:39,279
I have to be realistic now.

162
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,200
I have to erase that hope.

163
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:44,559
I know

164
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,240
I always refused before

165
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,360
because I'm waiting for my parents.

166
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,519
But now,

167
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,120
if someone wants to adopt me,

168
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,159
I accept, ma'am.

169
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,080
Fely?

170
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,039
You're not a burden here at all.

171
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:06,519
That's what you should know.

172
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,519
Okay?

173
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,440
Ma'am?

174
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:30,039
Ma'am?

175
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,519
Ma'am?

176
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,759
Here, have a drink.

177
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:41,639
I already told Mr. Abdi to change the lamp.

178
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,519
I'm calmer now.

179
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,600
Fortunately

180
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:52,919
your fear of the dark didn't make you faint this time.

181
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,200
I was so worried.

182
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:15,879
What is it, Fely?

183
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:18,159
I was accepted at Budi Dharma School.

184
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,639
-I'm grateful. -I am so glad.

185
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:25,720
Congratulations. So happy to hear that.

186
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,000
Fely?

187
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,159
I think Budi Dharma

188
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,399
is the best superior school

189
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,639
compared to other scholarship program schools.

190
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,679
Yes, ma'am. I'm grateful.

191
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:41,759
Later, please help with the documents, ma'am.

192
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,080
Soon, I'm starting a new school year.

193
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,559
Of course, darling.

194
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,159
By the way,

195
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,200
this is Chloe's school too.

196
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:57,399
This means that I will be going to the same school with Chloe.

197
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:02,639
Dear Mother,

198
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,759
I am so happy

199
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:09,000
finally I can be at the same school with Chloe again.

200
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:17,840
Give it back!

201
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:19,559
Return it!

202
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,720
Give it back!

203
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:25,720
Don't make fun of Chloe.

204
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:28,279
You only dare to mess with girls.

205
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:29,919
Come on.

206
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:31,559
Ouch.

207
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,840
Don't cry, Chloe.

208
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:36,279
Thank you, Fely.

209
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,279
Yeah, you don't need to be afraid.

210
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:40,240
If we are together,

211
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,799
we can be strong and can protect each other.

212
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,120
Yeah.

213
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,320
We will always be together.

214
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:48,240
Promise?

215
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,320
Promise.

216
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,360
Chloe.

217
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,559
How are you?

218
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,399
I miss you.

219
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,600
Drive your car properly!

220
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,080
Raga?

221
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,320
You already know the rules.

222
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:14,960
No parking here.

223
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:17,279
This is a drop off area, not a parking area.

224
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,679
You read there. There is no drop off area written.

225
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:28,360
Read. Can you read?

226
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,519
Yes.

227
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,639
You changed it yourself, right?

228
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,399
Or your younger siblings?

229
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,120
If you don't move the car now,

230
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,759
I as the council president will be forced to chain your car.

231
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,120
It's not good examples for others

232
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,159
and parents who drop off their children.

233
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:48,799
What did you say?

234
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,039
I'll chain your car.

235
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,320
It's okay. Just give in so you don't miss class.

236
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:05,880
Okay.

237
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,880
Okay.

238
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Are you okay?

239
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,200
How long have I been parked here?

240
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:43,319
A year? More? Two years?

241
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,359
And not a single person protested that I parked here.

242
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,680
Students or parents.

243
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:50,839
So, don't create problems that don't exist. Understand?

244
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,960
You do know you almost hurt someone!

245
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,039
Who are you?

246
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,480
Random girl.

247
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:01,039
Almost, right? No one got hurt.

248
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,240
Yes, I'm a "landom" girl.

249
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:07,880
You're a dangerous boy.

250
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,599
-My keys? -No.

251
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,200
-Return it! -No.

252
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,519
-Return it! -No.

253
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:17,160
-Return it. -No.

254
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,759
Come on, Raga.

255
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,400
Just let it go, Raga.

256
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,440
Soon it's class time.

257
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,440
Thank you.

258
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:29,880
Thank you

259
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:32,160
for helping me earlier.

260
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,200
By the way, are you the new kid?

261
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,599
Yes.

262
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,240
I'm Fely.

263
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:48,160
Hello?

264
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:49,559
Hi.

265
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:53,960
Excuse me.

266
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:55,319
I'm Hema.

267
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:57,640
I take you to the teacher's room.

268
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,095
I'm afraid you'll be confused about finding a room at this school.

269
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:01,920
Okay. Thank you.

270
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:11,960
Good morning.

271
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,079
Good morning, sir.

272
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,759
Children, please pay attention for a moment.

273
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,839
Today we have a new student.

274
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,759
Fely, please introduce yourself.

275
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:24,720
Hi everybody.

276
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:26,599
I'm Fely.

277
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,480
I hope we can be good friends.

278
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,640
-That's it. -That's it?

279
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:33,759
Okay. Please look for an empty seat.

280
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:35,279
-Thank you, sir. -You're welcome.

281
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,960
-Sir, I want to go to the toilet. -Okay.

282
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:06,960
Fely?

283
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,519
Where do you want to sit?

284
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:19,000
Hi, I'm Shania.

285
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,319
Fely.

286
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:22,440
-I'm Aline. -Fely.

287
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,440
Fely?

288
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,000
What's the matter? What are you thinking about?

289
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:38,559
Thinking about those boys?

290
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,039
Those boys.

291
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,000
-You fought with them earlier. -Did you see it too?

292
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:49,720
Yes. You better

293
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,880
keep your distance from them. Just to be safe.

294
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:23,599
My advice, don't mess with them.

295
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,960
They are usually called the Four Prince by the girls here.

296
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,079
Because they are handsome. Like a prince.

297
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,159
Their family is one of the largest contributors

298
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,559
to this school's foundation.

299
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,839
You could say they are real princes in this school. Right?

300
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,240
Yes.

301
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:41,119
The first prince is Raga.

302
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,000
Raga is the first brother. He failed a grade once

303
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:46,000
but not because he was stupid.

304
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,400
Precisely because he is too smart.

305
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,960
He can read opportunities.

306
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:53,680
He is busy with his top influencer work.

307
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:56,079
He is an automotive influencer

308
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,000
who has a lot of followers now.

309
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,759
I don't know much about automotive.

310
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,720
So, cars are not cool for me.

311
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,720
But cool men are like Raga.

312
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,039
Next, Jordan.

313
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,759
The calmest.

314
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:13,000
Maybe because he's a musician.

315
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:15,599
In my opinion, he is the most handsome.

316
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,920
Helga and Naviro

317
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:21,559
are said to be twins.

318
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:23,160
But not identical.

319
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,640
You are very handsome today.

320
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:26,456
Helga was the one who just bumped into you.

321
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,519
Shut up!

322
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:28,880
A true gamer.

323
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,880
Many girls approached him.

324
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,680
But still, he chose the game.

325
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,200
One more thing, pranking people.

326
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,480
You just noisy.

327
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,640
Naviro?

328
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:52,039
As for Naviro, he is the last child.

329
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:55,599
He understands best how to take care of his fans.

330
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,200
Most friendly.

331
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,160
Anyway,

332
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,359
my advice is not to mess with them.

333
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,640
Instead, you have to make them like you.

334
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,400
So you're safe.

335
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:09,759
Okay.

336
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:16,519
My necklace?

337
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Why isn't there?

338
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:28,759
Where is it?

339
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,599
Looks like it's here.

340
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:32,359
What's wrong?

341
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,799
What's the necklace like?

342
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,440
The necklace has a butterfly pendant.

343
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:38,559
Yes.

344
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,079
Oh no.

345
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:45,519
Butterfly pendant.

346
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:49,240
That's a necklace left by my parents.

347
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,119
There isn't any.

348
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,559
We'll look again.

349
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,680
Be patient.

350
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,559
It's okay. Now let's buy some food first.

351
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,920
Let's look again later, okay?

352
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,279
Thank you.

353
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,480
You're welcome.

354
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,079
Hi, Raga.

355
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:18,799
This is for you.

356
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,240
Hi, Fely.

357
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:43,000
Looking for me?

358
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,759
Return it!

359
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,519
Give it back!

360
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:57,440
Give it back!

361
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,400
Return it!

362
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,920
Give it back!

363
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:06,119
Give it back.

364
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,519
Keep on Raga!

365
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,640
Return it!

366
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:55,480
I really miss you.

367
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:57,559
Fely!

368
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,119
What are you doing?

369
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,240
Fely? I'm not the same Chloe I used to be.

370
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,440
I already have a new life here

371
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:10,400
and I decided to forget everything

372
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:12,240
about my time at the orphanage.

373
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:14,920
So, if you really care about me,

374
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:16,799
I ask you to stay away from me.

375
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:19,240
Stay away from me. Let's just say we never knew each other.

376
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,880
You...

377
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:23,519
You're not serious, right?

378
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:26,000
You understand what I said just now, right?

379
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:38,079
Yes ma'am.

380
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,000
Why is he speeding at a school zone?

381
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:45,079
Or is that how rich people behave?

382
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,359
That's called generalizing.

383
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,319
You should not

384
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,599
think negatively towards everyone.

385
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:58,680
Yeah, I'm just shocked.

386
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,319
Especially

387
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,680
when I met Chloe.

388
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:06,160
Chloe ignored me.

389
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,079
She's so unfriendly.

390
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,799
How can she ask me to pretend not to know her?

391
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,839
Well, maybe

392
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,960
Chloe is in trouble.

393
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,720
Having problems doesn't mean you forget your friends, right?

394
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,319
In fact, if she has a problem,

395
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,079
I want to help her.

396
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,920
By the way,

397
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,279
why do we cook differently today?

398
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,759
We want to celebrate your success tonight. Yes, right?

399
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:55,720
Ma'am, I'll call the younger siblings first.

400
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:57,519
Don't do it. Wait a minute.

401
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,039
Excuse me ma'am. The guests have arrived.

402
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,599
Thank you.

403
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:04,799
Are you inviting guests?

404
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:17,839
Ma'am?

405
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:19,680
Why is there Mr. Johan?

406
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,039
Actually

407
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:28,920
Mr. Johan wants to

408
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,640
adopt you.

409
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:34,480
Yes, that's right, Fely.

410
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,359
Since I knew you were a child at this orphanage.

411
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,799
Actually, I have long wanted to adopt a girl.

412
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,799
And I am grateful Ms. Ida agreed.

413
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,200
And let me introduce to you...

414
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,319
Boys?

415
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,480
My children.

416
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,960
I would like to formally introduce them to you.

417
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:22,640
Let me introduce to you

418
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:25,440
your future sibling.

419
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,400
We came here to get news like this?

420
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:39,000
Sit down first to get to know your adopted sister better.

421
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,480
I only have three brothers.

422
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:42,519
Even if you want to adopt a child,

423
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:44,480
why it has to be her?

424
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:45,640
Raga?

425
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,000
Why is my necklace with you?

426
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,759
-Give it back! -I'll give it back.

427
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,599
As long as you refuse my dad's adoption offer.

428
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,039
Watch where you're going!
