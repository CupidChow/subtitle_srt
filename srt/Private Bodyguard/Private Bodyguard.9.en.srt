4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,175
Do you really want to get rid of me from your family that bad?

5
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:12,439
Your method is so mean!

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,720
"My name is Fely, I'm brave."

7
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:20,239
She expressed her feelings, but got rejected.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,320
Hey.

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,719
Fely?

10
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:27,120
Just cry.

11
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:30,280
I'm not a cheap girl.

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,640
Watch out! I'll find whoever shared my video to the ends of the earth.

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,039
If you really don't have any feelings for Fely,

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,079
I've decided to approach her.

15
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,439
Are you serious?

16
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,159
I'm serious.

17
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:01,039
Well...

18
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:02,719
Bro?

19
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:04,680
If you need any help,

20
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,680
you could just ask me.

21
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:08,239
You know,

22
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:10,439
Fely is really a good girl.

23
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,480
You must be able to make her happy.

24
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:18,519
Treat her like she deserves.

25
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:20,239
Okay?

26
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,959
I promise.

27
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,599
EPISODE 9 SHY-SHY GIRL

28
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,520
Come to think of it,

29
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,879
it seems like she posted the video herself.

30
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,240
She wants to go viral.

31
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:50,360
I think so too. It did work.

32
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,639
In a bad way.

33
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,159
Fely?

34
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,680
I'll go to the toilet first.

35
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,840
I'm Gen-F!

36
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,360
I'm Gen-F too!

37
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,919
Fely's rejection movement!

38
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,439
Don't let me see this again.

39
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,919
This is an inspiration from you.

40
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,800
I said, don't let me see something like this again!

41
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,560
-You understand? -Raga, it's okay.

42
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,520
Leave them alone.

43
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,680
Oh God.

44
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,439
Why is your face so wrinkled, Chloe?

45
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,319
Well...

46
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,560
Gosh, it's so wrinkled.

47
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,120
Chloe looks like she needs Botox.

48
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,160
Don't you feel disturbed?

49
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,800
Disturbed by what?

50
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,279
Fely?

51
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:46,720
Whatever!

52
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,199
I'm tired of talking to you. It's a waste of energy.

53
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,839
Just relax, Chloe.

54
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:57,279
She has already become the number one laughing stock.

55
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,759
So, you don't need to worry.

56
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,079
Yes, but don't be too relax.

57
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,720
You see for yourself, right?

58
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,519
After confessing her feelings to Jordan,

59
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
she dared to approach Raga.

60
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,120
Aren't you guys worried?

61
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:15,839
What if Helga is the next target?

62
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,480
Or Naviro?

63
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,600
Haven't you thought about that?

64
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:23,199
But I'm sure,

65
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,560
if she really dares to approach them,

66
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:28,959
Helga and Naviro will also reject her like Jordan did.

67
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,600
Correct!

68
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,759
Just think positively, Chloe.

69
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:46,720
Home sweet home!

70
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,560
-I'll go to my room first. -Okay.

71
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,199
Let me.

72
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:02,776
-I'll carry it to your room. -That's okay.

73
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,199
No need.

74
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,439
Thank you.

75
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,959
Sad,

76
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,399
disappointed,

77
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:19,800
hurt.

78
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,279
That's what I've felt so far.

79
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,920
People's words are painful.

80
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,680
But it doesn't hurt more than a rejection.

81
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,959
Jordan's rejection

82
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,879
makes me question whether I am worthy of love.

83
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,439
First my parents and now Jordan.

84
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,360
Fely?

85
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,080
Hey!

86
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,480
You just play like a girl.

87
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:56,759
This is never a fair game, baby.

88
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
Yes!

89
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,159
"This is never a fair game, baby."

90
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,200
Practice more.

91
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:06,960
Gosh, you two are disgusting!

92
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,840
Keep practicing.

93
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,960
Where is Fely?

94
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,679
She hasn't come down to eat yet?

95
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:23,600
I invited her earlier. but she didn't want to.

96
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,080
Jordan?

97
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,639
I have a suggestion.

98
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,200
Brother to brother.

99
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,440
When it comes to girls,

100
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,960
don't be too nice.

101
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,120
Sometimes,

102
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,759
they like to misinterpret all our behavior.

103
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:43,919
Look at me.

104
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:45,720
I'm good.

105
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,320
Peaceful and serene.

106
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,840
Anyway, everything is good.

107
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:52,240
I don't like giving false hope to girls.

108
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,440
Unlike him.

109
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,360
Oh God. Seriously...

110
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,360
I feel bad about Fely.

111
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:09,919
Let me deliver this meal to her.

112
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,919
Wait.

113
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:16,039
You better not. Fely was clearly avoiding you earlier.

114
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,480
-Let me do it. -No need. Let me.

115
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,360
I know the food she likes.

116
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,919
It's midnight.

117
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,759
Is Jordan asleep yet?

118
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,279
What are you doing?

119
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:21,559
What about you?

120
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,320
Looking for Jordan?

121
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,559
I'm sorry. I'm just kidding.

122
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:27,679
Here.

123
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:29,919
I know you haven't eaten in a while.

124
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,080
You must be hungry.

125
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,360
So, this is Fely's orphanage style fried rice.

126
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:37,840
It's impossible not to eat your own fried rice.

127
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,279
Right?

128
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Thank you.

129
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,159
Just a suggestion.

130
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,559
You better listen

131
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,679
to Jordan's explanation.

132
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Don't avoid him.

133
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,240
He's been worried about you.

134
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,200
Dad?

135
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,799
Going to the office this weekend?

136
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,279
I just want to meet clients.

137
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,559
But where is Fely?

138
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,080
Usually she joins me for breakfast early in the morning.

139
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,440
I don't know.

140
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:35,120
Maybe

141
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,879
she was exhausted last night after the field trip.

142
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,679
Okay. You take care of everything. Alright?

143
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,480
I'm going first.

144
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:45,279
Don't forget to invite her for breakfast.

145
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,960
-Okay? -You got it.

146
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,440
Be careful, Dad!

147
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:01,159
Fely?

148
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,080
Fely?

149
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,039
JUST MOVE AWAY, YOU CHEAP GIRL

150
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,440
I like you.

151
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,480
Fely?

152
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,240
Fely?

153
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:16,720
Fely, what's wrong with you? What is that sound?

154
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,440
Fely?

155
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:20,240
It's nothing, Raga.

156
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:23,360
Fely, open the door.

157
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,159
Don't worry. I'm okay.

158
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,919
Open the door, Fely.

159
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,120
Fely?

160
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:36,919
Fely?

161
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,639
Are you okay?

162
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,279
Let me see.

163
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:43,799
Come here.

164
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:45,960
What are you doing?

165
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:47,519
Why did it fall like that?

166
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,879
Fely?

167
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,279
What is it?

168
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:04,720
What is it?

169
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:07,600
Actually that's not all.

170
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,480
Then?

171
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:10,559
What else?

172
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:13,519
I like you.

173
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:15,559
JUST MOVE AWAY, YOU CHEAP GIRL

174
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:17,360
Who sent this?

175
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:21,480
I don't know.

176
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,960
Okay, Fely. Look at me.

177
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,279
Listen to me.

178
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,240
Everything will be fine.

179
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,440
Trust me.

180
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:41,200
I'll help you

181
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,039
to find the one who posted the video. Okay?

182
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:52,200
Thank you.

183
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,799
I don't know where to start.

184
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,360
I shouldn't...

185
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:13,159
I shouldn't have confessed my feelings to Jordan.

186
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,159
I should have known

187
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,840
that I won't get what I want.

188
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,600
Because in my life,

189
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,080
I won't always get what I want.

190
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:33,440
Hey.

191
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,440
Fely?

192
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,639
Who says that?

193
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,799
The proof is

194
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,320
that you got the scholarship, right?

195
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,559
I'm sure that's one of your dreams.

196
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:50,039
So that you won't burden your orphanage anymore.

197
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:54,240
Right?

198
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,240
Since you've been here,

199
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,600
I've learned a lot about you.

200
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,599
You

201
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,480
do not want

202
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,480
to see other people in trouble.

203
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,440
And you don't like seeing other people in trouble.

204
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,400
Yes, I learned a lot from you.

205
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:20,319
So please, Fely.

206
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,680
Let me help you.

207
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,480
Okay?

208
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,400
Hey.

209
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,240
Why are you crying even more?

210
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:35,079
What happened to you?

211
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,759
Even though you like to annoy me, but this time I am touched.

212
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:50,200
Okay, now is the time

213
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,640
to make you happy

214
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,240
by finding out who posted the video.

215
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:59,480
I think the first step is,

216
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:02,400
ask Hema.

217
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,839
Because the video was uploaded

218
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,200
on the student council's account, right?

219
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,519
Don't look at the video again.

220
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:27,359
I just want to thank you for everything you do for me.

221
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:30,720
I'm also happy to help.

222
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:33,079
But actually

223
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,960
that's not all.

224
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:37,799
I like you.

225
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,440
It turns out Jordan was the one all along.

226
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:59,319
HEMA, ARE YOU FREE THIS AFTERNOON? CAN WE MEET AT RAFLES CAFE?

227
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:02,519
OKAY

228
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,000
-Hema? -Hi, Fely.

229
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:18,599
-Sorry I'm late. -That's okay.

230
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,480
Raga drove me here.

231
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,119
But why are you together?

232
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:28,680
It's a long story.

233
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:30,720
-But... -So, we're here...

234
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:32,400
Well, let's get to the point.

235
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:34,920
We're here to ask for your help.

236
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:37,759
To find out who logged into the student council's account

237
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:39,640
and uploaded yesterday's video.

238
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:40,799
"We?"

239
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,880
We.

240
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,440
Raga wants to help me.

241
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:47,680
-But... -So...

242
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Okay.

243
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,640
Actually, I found out already.

244
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,599
I've saved the video.

245
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,599
So, do you know the culprit?

246
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:02,480
That's the problem.

247
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,599
There is one foreign account

248
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:06,216
that logged into the student council's account.

249
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,960
I'm trying to trace the IP address

250
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,279
so I can enter it on the website

251
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:13,839
Andalan Mahasiswa IT like my brother did.

252
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:16,279
Okay.

253
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:31,279
What?

254
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,640
What is it?

255
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:35,359
Who did it?

256
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:38,279
Chloe. Chloe has illegally logged into the system.

257
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,559
Let me see.

258
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,480
Are you sure? Maybe you enter something wrong?

259
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,400
-The results are wrong perhaps? -Impossible. This can't be a lie.

260
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,799
The IP address is clear.

261
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,960
If she's smart, she should use a VPN so her IP address isn't discovered.

262
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:04,319
Fely?

263
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,559
Fely?

264
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:09,079
Hema? Thank you.

265
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:16,000
Have you known each other for a long time?

266
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:19,640
Like I said before, she used to be in the same orphanage with me.

267
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,720
We've been friends for a long time.

268
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,519
You could say she was my first best friend.

269
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,960
When Chloe was adopted,

270
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,880
our relationship became distant.

271
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,440
Chloe has also changed.

272
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,319
When I try to contact Chloe, she always avoided me.

273
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,400
That's why when she was nice to me yesterday,

274
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:41,720
I was very happy.

275
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:45,319
She also advised me to express my feelings to Jordan.

276
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:48,559
There's really no one I can trust.

277
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,480
There is.

278
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,960
Me.

279
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:56,799
You have me and I promise I won't let you down.

280
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,640
Thank you, Raga.

281
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,440
Why are we here in the auto shop?

282
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,160
Healing.

283
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,359
"Healing?"

284
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:32,200
Healing at the auto shop?

285
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:33,599
What's wrong with it?

286
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,519
The auto shop is where things are renewed.

287
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,880
And I'm sure you will like all my modifications.

288
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:47,039
Don't flatter yourself!

289
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,000
Here it is.

290
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,359
What's this?

291
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,319
My drawing.

292
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:15,160
Give me a break.

293
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,920
I really can't draw.

294
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,559
That's why I brought you here

295
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,720
to help me.

296
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:23,920
Please help me create

297
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,400
a blueprint for my modifications.

298
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:29,839
At the same time you do what you like most.

299
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:31,519
Drawing.

300
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,960
I'm sure it can be a distraction and healing

301
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,279
for you from all this.

302
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,519
How do you know I like to draw?

303
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,519
There are many things I know about you.

304
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,680
Well, if I help you,

305
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,920
what can you give me?

306
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,799
Can you drive?

307
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,640
Okay.

308
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,960
I will teach you how to drive in return.

309
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:07,440
-Really? -Yes.

310
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:10,400
But first complete your task to draw it.

311
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,319
So,

312
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:16,640
you want to modify

313
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:18,200
all the cars here?

314
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:22,519
My auto shop specializes in modifying cars.

315
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,920
There are many things that can be learned from modification.

316
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:27,440
For example?

317
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:29,039
For example,

318
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,519
radiators.

319
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:34,000
The radiator is used to maintain the car's temperature.

320
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,559
It can't get too hot and it can't get too cold.

321
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,960
Just like relationships, they have temperature too.

322
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:41,359
You must maintain it.

323
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,440
It can't get too hot and it can't get too cold.

324
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,519
-Okay. -Okay?

325
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,319
Yes!

326
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:14,440
Thanks.

327
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:18,799
For the car model, I'll finish it as soon as possible.

328
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,839
Watch out if you draw it badly.

329
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,039
It is true.

330
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:34,759
There's not a day without you annoying me.

331
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,160
That's why I'm so adorable.

332
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,039
Aren't you coming in?

333
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:54,680
Aren't you coming in?

334
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:57,640
Yeah. Let's go.

335
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,359
JORDAN INCOMING MESSAGE

336
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:03,758
YOU ARE INVITED TO THE FIRST EVER CONCERT OF

337
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:09,679
"DON'T WORRY" BY JORDAN WINSTON THIS MIDNIGHT 00.00 AM

338
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,519
AT BOYSROOM PLEASE COME

339
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:46,359
Here it is.

340
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,880
Nice.

341
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,960
Wait.

342
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,240
Why is Fely in the same car as them?

343
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,839
Hema?

344
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,359
What the hell?

345
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:04,400
-I was swindled. -Jordan,

346
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,039
I sent you to school so you can learn to be selective

347
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:10,440
and not to get swindled like this.

348
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,799
Keep looking.

349
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,559
How is that possible?

350
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,480
Now he likes Fely.
