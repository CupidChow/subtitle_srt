00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,798
WARNING THE FOLLOWING CONTAIN ELEMENTS OF BULLYING.

2
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:07,758
IT IS NOT TO BE FOLLOWED. VIEWER DISCRETION ADVISED.

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,039
SAY NO TO BULLY!

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,800
More precisely, it was you two who invited me here.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,119
Don't follow me just because you're my twin.

6
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:18,120
Who'd want to be your twin? You just never want to give in.

7
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:19,359
You said you wanted to leave.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,280
Yeah, but it didn't happen.

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,600
-Two minutes. -You can't.

10
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:26,480
Because you're crazy, seeking attention, sassy.

11
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,879
So, from now on it's better for you to stay away from him.

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,799
Wait.

13
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:39,920
Jordan, wait.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,119
Let me go.

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,520
I don't want to look weak in front of Chloe.

16
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,520
Let's go home.

17
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,239
What did you do to Fely?

18
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:09,640
Raga?

19
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:11,040
What did you do to Fely?

20
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,840
I didn't do anything.

21
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:14,599
She fell by herself.

22
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,719
That's normal because she's a new student.

23
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,319
She's probably not used to it yet.

24
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,400
It's okay. It takes time to learn.

25
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:23,599
Raga?

26
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,120
EPISODE 5 DOUBLE DATE

27
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,360
How are your feet?

28
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,599
They are better now.

29
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:02,879
What's wrong with them?

30
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,360
I don't know either.

31
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,439
Naviro?

32
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,439
I saw you cooking yesterday,

33
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,960
and it inspired me.

34
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,520
I haven't cooked in a long time.

35
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:36,680
I just found out that you can cook.

36
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,319
That's cool.

37
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,879
Men who can cook are cool.

38
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,599
I'm trying to cook based on your recipe.

39
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,879
Will you taste it later?

40
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,520
Is it good or bad?

41
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,520
Winston's fried rice.

42
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,376
Do you want me to help you chop the spices?

43
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,680
No need.

44
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,680
You'll see.

45
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,919
Master chef in action.

46
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,159
Okay.

47
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,879
Let me taste it.

48
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,639
Lack of salt.

49
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,639
Good?

50
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:36,319
Good.

51
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,959
Who taught you to cook?

52
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,600
My mom taught me to cook.

53
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,120
Cooking

54
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,959
always makes my stress go away.

55
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,279
Just like mom.

56
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,120
Mom does too.

57
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,279
Are you fighting with Helga?

58
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,800
How could he like the same girl as me?

59
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,560
And apparently it's been a long time.

60
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,519
I'm confused about what to do.

61
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:10,480
Why don't you try talking to Helga first?

62
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,680
I know Helga.

63
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,759
He won't budge.

64
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:20,560
How about talking to your brothers?

65
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,199
ARE YOU BUSY, JO?

66
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Helga?

67
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,199
Raga is looking for you.

68
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,879
Raga is looking for you.

69
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,199
He's waiting in your room.

70
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:00,000
He's waiting in your room.

71
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,680
He's the one looking for me, why should I go there?

72
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:11,279
He said if you won't go,

73
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,160
he will reset all of your video games.

74
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,800
Where is it?

75
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,680
Hey!

76
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,120
What are you doing here?

77
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,279
Looking for my watch.

78
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,200
-I've lost my watch. -You think I'm hiding it?

79
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,319
Who else then?

80
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,439
Not me.

81
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,279
Hey, open up!

82
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,040
Open the door!

83
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:59,519
We'll open this door in an hour.

84
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,279
So, have a good quality time, guys.

85
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,399
I warn you if you're still fighting.

86
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,680
Open the door!

87
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,920
Don't mess around!

88
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Don't bang on the door like that. It'll break.

89
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,639
Open the door!

90
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,839
Your idea is something.

91
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,120
This is what we usually do at the orphanage when someone fights.

92
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,800
Hey, open the door!

93
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:27,720
The door will break.

94
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:30,600
Why are you pushing me?

95
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,839
Why are you hitting me?

96
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,560
What are you doing?

97
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,600
I've been thinking.

98
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,360
I never thought

99
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,920
we would like the same girl.

100
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,040
Me too.

101
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,800
If that's the case,

102
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,199
how about we make a gentleman agreement?

103
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
About Monica?

104
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,040
What else?

105
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,680
If you think about it,

106
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,600
this is the first time we've had a fight because of women.

107
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,920
This does not rule out the possibility

108
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,879
that this incident will happen again.

109
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,560
So better we do something about it.

110
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,680
What do you mean?

111
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,639
We make an agreement.

112
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,959
We both express our feelings.

113
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,456
You confess your feelings to Monica.

114
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,319
I confess my feelings to Monica.

115
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:22,879
Then

116
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,360
we'll see

117
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,079
who will be accepted.

118
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,120
You use your method.

119
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:30,680
I use my method.

120
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,320
How about it?

121
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,200
What if she doesn't like either of us?

122
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,200
Do you think

123
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,120
if she didn't like us,

124
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:41,799
would she have come

125
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,679
when we invited her yesterday?

126
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,240
Deal?

127
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,360
Deal.

128
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:38,679
You are very busy this weekend.

129
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,320
What are you doing?

130
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:44,240
I'm confused.

131
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,480
About how to do art assignment.

132
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,159
The one with work of analysis.

133
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,600
I'm planning to go to the exhibition to do that assignment today.

134
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,360
Really? Is it okay if I come along?

135
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,879
I actually enjoy having company.

136
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:57,840
Shall we?

137
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:06,840
Where are you going?

138
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,080
Working on an assignment.

139
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,240
I am coming along.

140
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,519
I also want to do the assignment.

141
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:28,559
Anyway, I'll do the talking first.

142
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,519
It can't be like that.

143
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,919
That's unfair.

144
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,039
I was born two minutes before you.

145
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,720
I'm older.

146
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:38,320
Obviously I have to go first.

147
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,840
In fact, the older brother gives in to his younger brother.

148
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,320
We determine our fate

149
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,720
with this coin.

150
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:47,039
This is just fair.

151
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:49,799
I'll throw it.

152
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:53,120
You're the number.

153
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:54,735
I'm the one with the picture.

154
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:56,000
Okay?

155
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,639
Hi guys. What are you doing?

156
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,120
We are deciding who will pay.

157
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,360
Okay then.

158
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,399
So, who's treating us today?

159
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,600
Today Helga is paying.

160
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,879
Great! Thank you Helga.

161
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:28,120
Monica?

162
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,679
You just order first.

163
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:32,960
Okay.

164
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,159
Looks like I'm going to order something expensive.

165
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,600
Please do.

166
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,200
I'm just kidding, Helga.

167
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,360
Have you ordered?

168
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,840
We have.

169
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:53,879
Okay.

170
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,200
What is this?

171
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,840
Gosh, this is a parting gift for me?

172
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,399
Thank you guys.

173
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,159
How do you know?

174
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:26,120
Thank you.

175
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,320
"Parting?"

176
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,559
Yeah.

177
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,720
I will go to London with my dad.

178
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:36,399
London?

179
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,879
I just knew that.

180
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,416
But this is in the middle of the semester.

181
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,200
What can I do?

182
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,919
My dad changed job.

183
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,279
By the way,

184
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,159
if this isn't a parting gift,

185
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:54,799
what is it then?

186
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,080
Actually

187
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,759
this gift is to express my feelings for you.

188
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:09,720
Me too.

189
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:11,480
We love you, Monica.

190
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,000
Sorry, I am confused.

191
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,600
Do you feel the same way

192
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,320
to any of us?

193
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,480
Sorry, I just didn't think you could talk like this.

194
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:30,519
I'm really sorry.

195
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,639
I can't accept both of you.

196
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,240
I'll have to go.

197
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,440
I also can't do a long distance relationship.

198
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:43,399
I also have to focus on my studies.

199
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:50,399
But thanks guys.

200
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,440
You already consider me special in your eyes.

201
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,240
You are also special in my eyes.

202
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,080
Miss? Excuse me.

203
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:13,639
-Could you take our picture please? -Yes.

204
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,399
-Wait a minute, please. -Okay.

205
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:20,039
This is the phone.

206
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:27,799
Guys, we have to take photos for memory, okay?

207
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,639
I'm in the middle. Here.

208
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:33,480
Come here.

209
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:35,799
Come on, smile. Smile.

210
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,440
Smile. Cheese!

211
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,240
One, two, three.

212
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,000
-This way, Fely! -This way, Fely!

213
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,159
Let's go there. It looks fine.

214
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,960
Let's go here. We can see all the exhibitions.

215
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,879
Slowly.

216
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:36,200
Is your leg better?

217
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,120
It's all good now.

218
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,799
Let's take a selfie.

219
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,799
This is so cute.

220
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,679
One,

221
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:54,320
two, three.

222
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:56,960
Let me see.

223
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:58,159
Here it is.

224
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,159
The photo is ugly.

225
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,480
Use this.

226
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,440
Here it is.

227
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,679
This is what you called a photo.

228
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:17,279
Jordan?

229
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,120
Let's not stay here too long.

230
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,879
Today is dad's birthday.

231
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,279
Is it Mr. Johan's birthday today?

232
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:25,720
What did I say?

233
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:28,440
So, we're here not preparing anything?

234
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:30,440
Usually,

235
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:32,440
if we had time, we have dinner outside.

236
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:39,039
How about we prepare the dinner?

237
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,600
No need.

238
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:43,519
I told the chef to cook dad's favorite seafood.

239
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:47,000
Seafood?

240
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,960
Why?

241
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:57,000
No. Usually,

242
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,440
when I ate seafood, I got itchy.

243
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,399
Due to allergies.

244
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,759
Okay. Relax.

245
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,680
Later I will ask the chef to cook another menu.

246
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,440
Thank you, Jordan.

247
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,480
I'll go to the toilet first.

248
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,799
I've told you.

249
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,319
Keep your distance from Fely.

250
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,039
You will ruin our plans to make her uncomfortable with us.

251
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:32,880
Who's "we"?

252
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,480
I'm happy that Fely is staying in the house.

253
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:41,359
Besides, we don't have the right to kick Fely out of the house.

254
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:43,200
Dad wants her there.

255
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,119
What's wrong with Raga? Is he angry?

256
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:00,079
Why does he always have mood swings?

257
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,920
Is he bipolar?

258
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,799
Yeah. Come on.

259
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,160
Hello, Boss.

260
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,720
Hello, Chef.

261
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,039
Cook something delicious for us tonight.

262
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,680
Absolutely, Boss.

263
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:29,319
By the way,

264
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,039
can you cook something that contains a lot of seafood?

265
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,440
But make sure no one knows about it.

266
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,960
Okay.

267
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:40,960
Thank you.

268
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:50,480
Raga,

269
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:51,599
Jordan,

270
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:53,640
Helga, Naviro,

271
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:55,279
and Fely.

272
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,720
Thank you for preparing all of this.

273
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,480
I thought you guys forgot my birthday like last year.

274
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,640
Of course not.

275
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,359
How can we forget again?

276
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,680
Blow the candles, Dad.

277
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,400
Okay.

278
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:29,240
Eat. Let's eat.

279
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:31,279
This is what we've been waiting for.

280
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,279
Wait a minute.

281
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,720
Let's eat.

282
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,279
Dad,

283
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:49,640
this is corn fritter.

284
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:21,359
HELLO JORDAN, I'M BAIM FROM SINE RECORD.

285
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,999
CONGRATS ON WINNING THE YOUNG MUSIC COMPETITION.

286
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,840
I WANT TO DISCUSS MORE WITH YOU. REPLY THIS EMAIL IF YOU'RE INTERESTED.

287
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:28,880
What's wrong?

288
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,200
Jordan, why are you smiling?

289
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,599
Last month, I won a student music competition throughout Jabodetabek.

290
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,400
And just now

291
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,240
a record label just sent me an email.

292
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,599
They said they want to hear a demo of the song.

293
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:43,759
Nice.

294
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,240
Raga? How is it?

295
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,880
Have you found a new place for your workshop?

296
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,760
Still looking for it, Dad.

297
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,000
Because I'm looking for something a bit bigger.

298
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,640
So, it's not just a workshop,

299
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,200
but I want young people to be able to hang out there.

300
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:03,720
That is good.

301
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:06,680
This means you are smart in seizing opportunities.

302
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:21,359
What's wrong, Fely?

303
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,599
This has shrimp in it.

304
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:34,200
Are you allergic to seafood?

305
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,440
Why didn't you watch what you ate?

306
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:38,759
I thought

307
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,839
this is only a regular corn fritters.

308
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:43,880
Fely, are you allergic to seafood?

309
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:46,400
Do you want to call a doctor?

310
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:47,799
No need, sir.

311
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,640
Usually the itching disappears within a week.

312
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,119
I'll excuse myself for a moment.

313
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:14,079
Are you better now?

314
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,279
Why are you standing here alone?

315
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:19,359
Haven't you gone to bed yet?

316
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:22,920
I'm sorry, Mr. Johan.

317
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,839
Your birthday event was a mess because of me.

318
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:29,519
Don't say that.

319
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,960
I'm going to my room first.

320
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,680
If your allergies haven't gone away,

321
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:36,960
tell me.

322
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,240
Fely?

323
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:53,559
The chef has prepared new food.

324
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,759
There is no seafood in it.

325
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:58,599
No need, Jordan.

326
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:00,359
I'm not hungry yet.

327
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:04,240
Are you still itching?

328
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,920
I'm better now.

329
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:13,920
After receiving the good news,

330
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,960
why aren't you feel excited?

331
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,319
I've felt all this time, Dad never supported me.

332
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:25,880
I just got an offer from a record label.

333
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:28,359
Which is a big deal for me.

334
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,201
But it seems like I'm the only one who feels that way in this family.

335
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:35,519
I'm happy too.

336
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,200
In my opinion,

337
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,559
when it comes to Mr. Johan,

338
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:45,119
you just need to talk to him alone.

339
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,400
For example, spending quality time.

340
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:51,359
Maybe Mr. Johan doesn't understand the world of music.

341
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:53,519
When do you plan to have a meeting?

342
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,160
I already replied.

343
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,400
The record label people want to hear my demo tomorrow.

344
00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:00,279
He asked to meet at the office and I knew

345
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:02,559
this record label is one of the most famous here.

346
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:05,519
Congratulations.

347
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:07,440
In that case,

348
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:09,599
I also have to accompany you.

349
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:12,839
That's okay, right? Please.

350
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,759
I can, right?

351
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,480
SINE RECORD MUSIC STUDIO

352
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:54,319
Fely, you keep scratching. Don't you want to go to the doctor?

353
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,160
-Your face hasn't healed yet. -It's okay.

354
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:58,879
The doctor can give me injection later

355
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,319
but this can't wait.

356
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,359
Excuse me.

357
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,720
Jordan?

358
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:10,960
I'm Baim. The manager who called you.

359
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,559
Jordan. Nice to meet you, sir.

360
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,480
No need to call me sir. Just call me Baim.

361
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:20,720
Let's go inside. I can't wait to hear your demo.

362
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,240
Is your friend a celebrity?

363
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:29,519
No, sir.

364
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:31,720
I just accompanying Jordan.

365
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,519
Okay. Let's go inside.

366
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:34,839
Yeah.

367
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,000
Fely?

368
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,039
You wait here.

369
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:42,480
But I also want to hear your song.

370
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,279
One day.

371
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:47,079
I'm not ready now.

372
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,400
Jordan?

373
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:51,240
Come on!

374
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,039
I like it very much.

375
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,480
Did you make this yourself?

376
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,680
Yes.

377
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:27,680
You got talent, man.

378
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,960
Hopefully I can be the right person for you.

379
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,559
Because of the singers I managed,

380
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,160
I made them big from nothing.

381
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,000
I will send my team portfolio later.

382
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:41,480
So you can know who we are.

383
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:44,160
Also the expenses you need to pay.

384
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,920
Expenses?

385
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:47,880
I didn't know there would be expenses.

386
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:51,079
Everything costs money, Jo.

387
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:53,200
Promotion,

388
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,720
recording,

389
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:56,839
social media manager.

390
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,240
It's a lie if anyone says that building a career doesn't cost money.

391
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:03,559
Nonsense.

392
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:05,559
I'd rather be open with you from the start.

393
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:07,400
I'm not forcing you.

394
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,240
Just think about it first

395
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:12,519
while you read our portfolio.

396
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,920
Later I will also send you a draft contract.

397
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,839
Everything is clear there.

398
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,720
No gimmicks.

399
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,440
If you agree,

400
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:23,960
we'll begin.

401
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:39,799
Next time, If you need help just say so.

402
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,119
Wait, Jordan.

403
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:53,000
Are you still itching?

404
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:55,000
I'm better now.

405
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,359
Fely?

406
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,160
Fely?

407
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,920
Fely?

408
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,799
I'm sorry.

409
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,000
Actually

410
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:00,559
I told the chef to cook the food that way.

411
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,279
But hopefully...

412
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,119
Hopefully this medicine

413
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,039
can make you recover faster.

414
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:14,079
You're actually really annoying,

415
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,960
but I shouldn't be like that.

416
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:58,880
Jordan?

417
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,640
Are you driving to school?

418
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,759
Why?

419
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:04,039
-Want to go together? -Yes.

420
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:07,599
You all have gone too far.

421
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,519
Where are you going?

422
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,240
Davina?

423
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:16,400
Davina already told everything,

424
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,559
that you are the culprit, Raga.

425
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,160
Hence, you're suspended.
