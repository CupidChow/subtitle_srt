WARNING THE FOLLOWING CONTAIN ELEMENTS OF BULLYING.

2
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:07,758
IT IS NOT TO BE FOLLOWED. VIEWER DISCRETION ADVISED.

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,039
SAY NO TO BULLY!

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,279
That you are the perpetrator, Raga.

5
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:13,880
Perpetrator? It's me who helped Davina.

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,480
This is the proof.

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,559
Because you are making it up to defend Raga,

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,039
I will suspend you both.

9
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:26,199
What are you doing here?

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,480
Security?

11
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:31,519
Where are you going?

12
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:32,640
Where are you going?

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,159
How can she share a car with Helga?

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,920
What?

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,560
Who is she?

16
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,240
Next week we have a field trip, right?

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,000
Yes. Why?

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,760
Why are you suddenly talking like that?

19
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:12,879
Stop!

20
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:15,959
Why?

21
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:19,439
You're packing, right?

22
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,760
-Yes. -This is not how you do it.

23
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,719
I'll show you. Fold these one by one.

24
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,200
Fold it

25
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,439
then roll it.

26
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:35,560
If you want more space, fold it like this.

27
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,760
That's it.

28
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,120
That's the way.

29
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:40,159
I see.

30
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,879
Do you understand now?

31
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,079
Not yet.

32
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,400
Show me again.

33
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:48,120
Fold it

34
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,879
then roll it like this.

35
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,879
You should pay attention.

36
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:08,000
If you've done it, why should I repeat it?

37
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,240
How did you do that earlier?

38
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,159
I'll show you.

39
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,560
Follow me.

40
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,080
Fold it.

41
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,319
-Fold. -Fold it.

42
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,120
Then roll it.

43
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:42,120
-Roll? -Yes.

44
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,599
That's a very small roll.

45
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,319
That's how you do it. Put it here.

46
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,639
-Here it is. -Yeah.

47
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,199
Fold it again.

48
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,319
EPISODE 7 LOST FRIENDS

49
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,160
Who doesn't bring their stuff?

50
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,560
-Why are there only four suitcases? -Me.

51
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,360
Why?

52
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,319
For what? I'd better be at home.

53
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,720
But Raga,

54
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,720
this is a school field trip.

55
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,839
It will affect your school marks.

56
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:36,600
Hema also mentioned that he had put together this OSIS program.

57
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,439
He said the scores would be compiled for Civics Education.

58
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,720
Fely is right, Raga.

59
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,439
You have to come along.

60
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,439
This is a school program.

61
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,160
Hi, Fely.

62
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:16,639
Hi.

63
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,879
Who let you sit there?

64
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,399
I'm just following the rules. Sit alphabetically.

65
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,279
In that case,

66
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:34,199
the first letter of his name has an "H".

67
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:38,199
So, he can sit there, right?

68
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,000
Helga?

69
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,040
You'd better sit here

70
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,519
or sit with Yolanda?

71
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:59,000
Get up!

72
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,720
-Get up! -Why kick Hema out?

73
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,399
-Come on, get up quickly! -What the hell, Raga?

74
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,120
-It's okay. I'll just move. -That's right.

75
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,959
Good boy.

76
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:33,000
Phew.

77
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,399
Why are you here?

78
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,120
Did you forget

79
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:43,079
I was helping you until I got suspended?

80
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,959
So, it's time for you to return the favor.

81
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:49,399
Didn't I help you?

82
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,079
But who forced me to come along?

83
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:55,199
You, right?

84
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,600
So, while I'm here

85
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,439
you must always be ready 24 hours,

86
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:03,480
to help me if I need assistance.

87
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,879
Whatever.

88
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,879
I need everyone's attention please.

89
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,720
-We already divided the groups, right? -Yes, sir.

90
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,040
Okay. So, our first task is to distribute basic necessities

91
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,600
to every house around here.

92
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,399
-Understand? -Understood, sir.

93
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:48,879
The theme for our field trip is sharing with others.

94
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:51,959
Okay then. We have some time to rest.

95
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,000
Rest up, and then we'll reconvene later.

96
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,480
Okay. Thank you for your attention. Have a good rest.

97
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,519
-Please. -Okay, sir.

98
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,040
Let's go.

99
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,000
Kai?

100
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:13,040
I hope you don't cause any more trouble here.

101
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:16,279
You should know that

102
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,199
you are allowed to participate here

103
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,720
in order to discipline yourself.

104
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:24,360
Remember Kai.

105
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,360
You're under my supervision.

106
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,040
Understand?

107
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Don't forget your drink.

108
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,120
Yes.

109
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,639
Here. You haven't had one, right?

110
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,440
Thank you.

111
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:02,679
You don't have to trouble yourself.

112
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,200
It's alright.

113
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:06,440
It's my job as a committee member.

114
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:09,279
Okay. I go first.

115
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:24,639
Feed me.

116
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,799
Feed me. I am busy.

117
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:31,039
I have to monitor my content. See?

118
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:32,919
A lot, right?

119
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,720
Remember,

120
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,279
your debt has not been paid off.

121
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,360
Not settled yet.

122
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,039
As far as I know,

123
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,399
a debt is incurred until death. Am I right?

124
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,720
Right?

125
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,240
I am busy. Help me. My stomach hurt already.

126
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,559
Okay.

127
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,360
Do it properly!

128
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,159
Well, who ordered me to feed you?

129
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:11,480
You did, right?

130
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,799
You said I was evil. You're the bad one.

131
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,639
Let's eat together.

132
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,279
Okay.

133
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:28,799
What's your side dish?

134
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:30,679
Duck.

135
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,600
-How about you? -What is this? Fish?

136
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,559
It seems like

137
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,240
I always see you

138
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,639
alone with Jordan.

139
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:49,960
Really?

140
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,759
Maybe it's just a coincidence.

141
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,679
Looks like I missed some news.

142
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:01,399
There isn't any. There isn't anything.

143
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,840
Really?

144
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:05,360
Yes. Seriously, guys?

145
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,919
But I noticed

146
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:10,919
something strange earlier.

147
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,240
Strange how?

148
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,799
It's not you with Jordan.

149
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,639
But with Raga.

150
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,039
-Raga? -Yes.

151
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,200
You two look so close

152
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,440
and you even feed each other.

153
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,080
No!

154
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:30,120
I am not close to Raga.

155
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,679
Raga is the most annoying man I have ever met.

156
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,759
Annoying or fun?

157
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,919
Oh Fely.

158
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,919
-Here. Let me help. -No need. Let me.

159
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,519
Let me, okay.

160
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,600
Which box is next?

161
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,360
I can do it myself.

162
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,240
It's better if you just help your group.

163
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:10,120
Thanks, Raga.

164
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,720
Thanks for helping my group.

165
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,679
Later, if you need more help,

166
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:19,240
just say so.

167
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,080
Have some water, Fely.

168
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,320
Thanks, Hema.

169
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,639
Are you going straight back to the inn?

170
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,519
No.

171
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,320
I want to go for a walk first.

172
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,679
Earlier, when I was distributing basic necessities,

173
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:11,199
the view around here looks nice.

174
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,279
Really?

175
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:14,559
I'll go with you.

176
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,559
-Really? -Yes.

177
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:20,840
Because Shania and Alin have work to do.

178
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,360
So I'm alone.

179
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,480
Okay.

180
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:25,399
Let's go.

181
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,919
Do you want to take a rest?

182
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:50,080
No need.

183
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,240
Thank you.

184
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:19,200
Next time, we better borrow a villager's motorbike.

185
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,159
For that, I agree.

186
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,759
By the way,

187
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,240
how is it going with the agency manager?

188
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,120
He couldn't be contacted all of a sudden.

189
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,839
SO, BAIM, WHAT'S NEXT FOR ME? I'LL WAIT FOR YOUR CALL

190
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,919
I'VE TRANSFERRED THE MONEY, WHY HAVEN'T I HEARD ANYTHING FROM YOU?

191
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:05,840
What are you going to do?

192
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,080
I'm planning to go to his place after this school trip.

193
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,840
I hope it's nothing bad.

194
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,840
Maybe he was busy.

195
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:32,399
Hema?

196
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:33,919
Have you seen Fely?

197
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,919
She was with Jordan just now.

198
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,639
Do you want a snack?

199
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:47,960
I'm passing by.

200
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:51,440
Why are you ignoring me?

201
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,879
What did I do wrong?

202
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,200
I never felt that I ignored you.

203
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,360
Everything I do is to give you my full attention.

204
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,919
But you're busy paying attention to other girls.

205
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,840
It's clear there's a girl here who has liked you for a long time, Raga.

206
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:08,120
Like I said,

207
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,080
I never felt that I ignored you

208
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,480
because we weren't close.

209
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,000
Where are you guys?

210
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,399
What's wrong with you?

211
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,639
Suddenly so angry.

212
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,320
-Are you with Jordan or Fely? -No.

213
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:39,320
Just with Naviro.

214
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,960
-Why? -They haven't returned yet.

215
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,600
They can't be contacted either.

216
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:45,879
Good grief. I thought something bad happened.

217
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,759
You call me because Jordan and Fely haven't returned yet?

218
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:52,919
If it's Jordan, he was probably walking around looking for inspiration.

219
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,080
If it's Fely,

220
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,799
maybe she's with her friend.

221
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:57,480
-Yes. -No.

222
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:58,919
Jordan is with Fely.

223
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,399
Then it's okay.

224
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,399
Why ask us again?

225
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:06,119
You're not helping.

226
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:28,759
Looks like it's this way. Is that right?

227
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,480
Yes, that seems right.

228
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:36,079
Come on. It's late.

229
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:41,599
Jordan?

230
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:45,200
-What? -I just realized there's no signal here.

231
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:54,720
It's the same for me.

232
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,240
Watch out.

233
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,160
Jordan?

234
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,519
Looks like we're lost.

235
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,720
I'm scared. It's better if we just turn around.

236
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,200
Let's just turn around.

237
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,759
Excuse me, sir.

238
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:44,200
I'm looking for my friend.

239
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:46,559
Have you seen this person?

240
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,839
No, I haven't.

241
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,640
Wait. What about this one?

242
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,440
Also no.

243
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,079
-Thank you, sir. -You're welcome.

244
00:18:58,359 --> 00:18:59,880
Oh man!

245
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:05,640
DAD INCOMING CALL

246
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:09,519
DAD INCOMING CALL

247
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,720
Hello, Dad.

248
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:13,599
Hello, Raga.

249
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,759
How are you guys?

250
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,200
We are good, Dad.

251
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:19,000
How about Fely?

252
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:22,079
Because I tried calling, but it didn't connect.

253
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:25,759
Fely is fine.

254
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:27,880
Maybe she's with her friends.

255
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,599
That's why she doesn't answer her phone.

256
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,759
Why is Raga's father asking for Fely?

257
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,440
Okay then. You all behave, okay?

258
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,839
Send my regards to Naviro, Helga, Fely, and Jordan.

259
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,519
-Okay? -Yes, Dad.

260
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,960
Where are they?

261
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,240
Watch out.

262
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:13,799
Jordan, looks like we are very lost.

263
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,799
We'd better go back.

264
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,039
Yes, let's just turn around.

265
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,319
Who's there?

266
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,680
Hello.

267
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:36,119
I heard someone got lost here.

268
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,440
It turns out to be you guys.

269
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:38,960
What do you want?

270
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,359
What else

271
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,079
if not to get revenge on that girl?

272
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:45,079
Ouch!

273
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,680
Don't be stupid!

274
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:52,640
How dare you!

275
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,039
Jordan!

276
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,880
Run, Fely!

277
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,400
Where are you going?

278
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:08,119
Fely!

279
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,759
Fely!

280
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,240
Ouch!

281
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,480
Ouch!

282
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,200
Hey.

283
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:29,599
Thank you.

284
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,480
Thank you for being fine.

285
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,000
I should be the one thanking you.

286
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,680
This time I will report you to the teacher.

287
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:56,880
Don't.

288
00:21:57,839 --> 00:21:59,319
If you report him to the teacher,

289
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,680
it will be over.

290
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,720
He will be expelled from school.

291
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:04,759
I don't need your pity.

292
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,759
Who pities you?

293
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,720
I want to make a deal with you.

294
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:17,599
I won't complain to school

295
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,960
as long as you don't consider me your enemy anymore.

296
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:23,119
We have been enemies for too long.

297
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:24,640
I can't even recall

298
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:27,839
the problem that makes us dislike each other.

299
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:29,960
I'm sure you feel the same way.

300
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,720
Right?

301
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,799
Deal?

302
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:39,039
Or do you prefer to get expelled from school?

303
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:03,839
Fely?

304
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,640
I just heard everything from Jordan.

305
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,960
I was shocked to hear the story.

306
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,759
Especially seeing my best friend hurt like this.

307
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,359
"Best friend?"

308
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:33,640
Sorry if all this time, I've been mean to you.

309
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,839
I just don't want my past to be exposed.

310
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:42,880
But that doesn't mean I behave like that to my best friend.

311
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:45,240
I'm sorry, Fely.

312
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:50,079
If you may,

313
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,720
I want us

314
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:55,559
to be friends again like before

315
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,000
if you can still accept me.

316
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,119
What are you talking about?

317
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,000
We are not strangers.

318
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:07,279
Once a best friend,

319
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,720
always a best friend.

320
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,319
So, what about Jordan?

321
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,960
You guys get lost like that.

322
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,759
At first we were just walking around.

323
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:34,920
Then we got lost.

324
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:40,279
Okay. Let me guess.

325
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,640
You like Jordan, right?

326
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:46,599
Right?

327
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,960
You can't lie to me.

328
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:52,079
I've known you from a long time ago.

329
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,039
Yeah?

330
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,119
Honestly, he's actually not my type.

331
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:04,519
But he is the nicest to me.

332
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,160
But promise not to tell anyone.

333
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:08,519
Because I am

334
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:12,119
not sure if Jordan feels the same way about me.

335
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,079
From what I see,

336
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,440
Jordan seems to feel the same way about you.

337
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,920
If not,

338
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:25,599
why does he want to go out alone with you like that?

339
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:26,839
Right?

340
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,640
No.

341
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,200
Really?

342
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,599
You don't know Jordan, do you?

343
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,440
He likes to be alone.

344
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:38,279
Except with people he considers close.

345
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,839
As far as I can see, it's only his brothers.

346
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,599
But he walks alone with you.

347
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,240
I've never seen him walk with another girl.

348
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,400
In my opinion,

349
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:52,599
if you really like him,

350
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,839
how about you

351
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,200
express your feelings to Jordan?

352
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,079
So you also know how he feels about you.

353
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,000
Besides, time has changed.

354
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,640
Why do girls have to wait for boys to express their feelings?

355
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,960
How long do you want to be like that?

356
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,759
-But... -But it's up to you.

357
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,960
Just think about it.

358
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,640
You take it to sleep or

359
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,640
think about what you want.

360
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,279
I think that's the best step for you.

361
00:26:26,599 --> 00:26:28,680
So that you don't have false hopes.

362
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:38,720
So how is it?

363
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,680
Have you took it to sleep?

364
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:42,079
Took what to sleep?

365
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,039
I told Fely that Jordan likes her.

366
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:49,480
But she didn't believe it.

367
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:52,319
In fact, how could Jordan

368
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,160
go out alone with a girl if he doesn't like her?

369
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:57,880
Right, Shania?

370
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,519
I agree.

371
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,039
There you go. And in any case,

372
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:06,640
I think that to avoid any misunderstandings,

373
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,960
you should express your feelings to Jordan.

374
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,359
Right?

375
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,599
At least you try.

376
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,720
Right?

377
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:14,880
I agree.

378
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,920
Besides, if he doesn't like you, why are you putting your hope in him?

379
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:22,839
The problem is there is one thing I can't tell you.

380
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:25,920
I guess this would be one of the reasons...

381
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,319
Okay.

382
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,680
Are you better off feeling unsure

383
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:33,319
like that?

384
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,920
You better hope,

385
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:37,240
but never be sure.

386
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,759
Seriously?

387
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,400
Fely?

388
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:54,079
-What's up? -Hi.

389
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:58,640
What is it? Why do you want to meet in a place like this?

390
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:00,680
I...

391
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,359
I just want to thank you for everything you did for me.

392
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:08,640
I'm also happy to help you.

393
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,240
But

394
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,359
actually that's not all.

395
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:20,799
What else?

396
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,000
I like you.

397
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,839
Why Fely express her feelings first?

398
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,920
I'm embarrassed if a girl expresses her feelings to a boy first.

399
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,480
And got rejected.

400
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:56,720
I don't want to meet anyone, Shania.

401
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:00,079
I feel like disappearing. Who could do that?

402
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,775
There's something I want to talk to you.

403
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:04,559
I didn't mean to intrude or anything.

404
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,400
So, you don't have

405
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,720
any feelings for Fely?
