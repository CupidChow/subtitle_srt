00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,599
Don't worry. Now I consider you as my best friend now.

5
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,679
Best friends forever?

6
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:16,719
Best friends forever.

7
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:18,000
So here you are.

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:19,960
A coward who only blackmails people.

9
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:22,839
You have to believe that I will upload this recording.

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,440
All the students here should know that you regret your actions.

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,760
I promise I won't do it again.

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,640
She's been adopted

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,679
by the Winston family.

14
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:35,479
I was swindled.

15
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:37,039
Swindled?

16
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:39,000
But I'm doing this to pursue my dreams.

17
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:41,840
I know. But not in a stupid way.

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,640
If I'm stupid,

19
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:45,576
that's because I don't have anyone to guide me.

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,039
I understand what you're doing.

21
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,719
We all have our own paths to make our dreams come true.

22
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,920
And the support Jordan is looking for most is the support from you.

23
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,479
Thank you, Fely.

24
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,959
For reminding me.

25
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,519
I've just realized

26
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,959
it's been a while since I was in this room.

27
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:58,760
These are all your songs?

28
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,680
Can you play all these musical instruments?

29
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,400
Yeah.

30
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:28,680
I'm proud of you.

31
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:35,199
I apologize for rarely showing it.

32
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:44,719
I'm sorry too.

33
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:47,520
The money I gave to that manager...

34
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:52,360
Do you know how many times I got swindled?

35
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:57,240
Got swindled by sources, clients, business partner.

36
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,680
I won't tell you because you'll definitely be angry.

37
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,639
Can you sing a song for me?

38
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:13,479
Now?

39
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,639
Yeah.

40
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,319
Of course.

41
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,479
Guys? Take a look.

42
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:31,439
I've seen it too. It's on the social media.

43
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,878
I heard some journalist found this info

44
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,478
when they want to write an article

45
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:38,280
-about Mr. Johan. -Is that so? Really?

46
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,199
This is crazy.

47
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,840
I never thought

48
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:47,800
that she was secretly an illegitimate child.

49
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,439
FELY IS ILLEGITIMATE CHILD OF THE WINSTON FAMILY

50
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,879
Talk about, "don't judge the book by it's cover."

51
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,479
Maybe she wasn't an illegitimate child,

52
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,560
But a child from her dad's affair.

53
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,840
Take back what you said!

54
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,680
So angry.

55
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:09,639
That means it's true, right?

56
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,199
Go away all of you!

57
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,000
Go away!

58
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,720
Is it because of this that dad wanted to adopt her?

59
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,839
If you think about it, it makes sense.

60
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,399
Tell me

61
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:34,199
that's a lie, right?

62
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,040
That's a lie, right?

63
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,600
Why you ask me like that?

64
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,879
Just answer it.

65
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:52,839
Yes or no.

66
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,199
Answer it!

67
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:00,480
Why should I answer your stupid questions?

68
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,800
Do you believe this news?

69
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,720
Fely?

70
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,879
We should have been suspicious from the start.

71
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,680
I don't believe

72
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,720
you guys are accusing me of this.

73
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,480
You guys are mean!

74
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,680
Fely?

75
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,920
Rama? You’re here. I was just about to call you.

76
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,560
Excuse me, sir. You should see this news.

77
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,758
JOHAN WINSTON SECRETLY HAVE AN ILLEGITIMATE CHILD? ALLEGEDLY NAMED FELY

78
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,079
JOHAN WINSTON SECRETLY HAVE AN ILLEGITIMATE CHILD? ALLEGEDLY NAMED FELY

79
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,120
And

80
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,240
the news is now viral.

81
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:15,439
-Yes? -Boss. Take a look at this news.

82
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,199
The news said she is Johan's illegitimate child.

83
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,439
-Okay. -I sent the link.

84
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,079
JOHAN WINSTON SECRETLY HAVE AN ILLEGITIMATE CHILD? ALLEGEDLY NAMED FELY

85
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:32,839
Is that Felysia?

86
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,199
Be patient.

87
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,199
Be patient.

88
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,040
-Ma'am. -Yes?

89
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:52,920
-Yes. Thank you. -Thank you.

90
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,759
Excuse me. Anything I can help you with?

91
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:01,160
I...

92
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:05,319
I came here to look for

93
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,000
Felysia.

94
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,560
Who are you?

95
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,959
Let me introduce myself,

96
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:16,319
I'm Andreas Geralda.

97
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,639
I am Felysia's biological father.

98
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,279
KASIH IBU ORPHANAGE

99
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,080
That butterfly necklace,

100
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:54,039
was bought by me.

101
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,240
EPISODE 11 THE UNEXPECTED

102
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,000
I bought that necklace for your late mother.

103
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,360
Because

104
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,639
she really likes

105
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:15,200
everything about butterfly.

106
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,840
As soon as you were born,

107
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,960
your mother immediately put the necklace on you.

108
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,799
Take a look.

109
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,039
That's me and your mom.

110
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:39,720
And you're that little baby.

111
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:53,240
Yes, that's your mother.

112
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:56,360
That woman entrusted me with you when you were a baby.

113
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,919
First of all, I want to apologize to you.

114
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I can't

115
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,159
look after you

116
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,960
and your late mother who was sick at that time.

117
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:27,799
So, we were forced to leave you here.

118
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:33,240
I remember.

119
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,440
I remember that day...

120
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:38,879
I only...

121
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,000
I only able to wait

122
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,519
in the car park

123
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,559
because I can't

124
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,759
bear to leave you here.

125
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:55,799
I was devastated.

126
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,440
But

127
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:06,559
at that time your mother was determined

128
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:10,759
to take you back from here when she gets better.

129
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,240
But unfortunately,

130
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,159
her illness took her life.

131
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:23,559
Yeah...

132
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,759
At that time

133
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,159
I was depressed.

134
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,919
I think...

135
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,960
Well...

136
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:42,080
I can't even take care of myself, let alone having to take care of you.

137
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,120
So, you

138
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,000
lived and grew up in this place.

139
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,840
And

140
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,279
as time goes by I become more and more

141
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,600
embarrassed to meet you.

142
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,639
Once again,

143
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,039
I'm sorry.

144
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:16,480
But now,

145
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,960
I am

146
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,759
capable

147
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,240
to start a new life again

148
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,919
with the only family I ever had.

149
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:30,320
That's you, Fely.

150
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,480
Once again, please forgive me.

151
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:40,559
Because I left you here.

152
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,639
By the way, ma'am?

153
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:51,000
If I may know,

154
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,919
is there any family

155
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,759
that has been planning to adopt Fely all this time?

156
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,960
It's actually in progress of adoption.

157
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,600
But it's all depends on Fely.

158
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,519
She may accept or reject

159
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:09,279
any party.

160
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,120
Yeah.

161
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,840
It's okay.

162
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:22,320
I leave all the decisions

163
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,120
to you.

164
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:29,720
I let you choose.

165
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,799
I won't force you.

166
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,120
I won't force you, okay?

167
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,279
You decide for yourself.

168
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,240
But if you're

169
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,360
ready,

170
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,720
wanting

171
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:47,240
to live with me,

172
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,279
I will take care of it.

173
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:55,240
I will prepare everything for your move.

174
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,720
One more thing.

175
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,960
I live in Surabaya now.

176
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,720
I'm sorry.

177
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,840
I...

178
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,240
I need time.

179
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:22,799
Yeah.

180
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:27,159
Yeah, it is okay.

181
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:29,639
It's okay, Fely.

182
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,919
It's okay.

183
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,559
Here it is.

184
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:40,000
This is my phone number.

185
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,399
So, whenever you want to call me,

186
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,840
you can.

187
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,799
Any time.

188
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:03,159
Where is Fely?

189
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,679
Do you already know

190
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,200
what’s going on?

191
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,440
Is the news true?

192
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,759
That's not true.

193
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,399
Are you sure?

194
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:25,039
If I say it's not true, that means it's not true.

195
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:27,919
Because at that time, you kept quiet about that woman.

196
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:31,240
How can we be sure, that this time you are not being secretive about Fely?

197
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:38,200
Okay.

198
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,840
Be patient.

199
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:41,679
I'm on my way.

200
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,919
Raga, listen to me first.

201
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:01,759
I apologize for not telling you about my plan to remarry.

202
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:05,639
You really don't think we're important in your life, right?

203
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,320
That's not true.

204
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:11,480
Honestly, I haven't told all of you yet

205
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,200
because I'm not ready for your judgement.

206
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,720
Is that why you didn't tell us?

207
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,039
Do you want to just get married straight away?

208
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,480
Raga?

209
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:32,679
Maybe we should listen to Dad first.

210
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:34,399
I have to catch a plane.

211
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,320
Let's talk about it together.

212
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Raga?

213
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:44,080
Please don't leave yet.

214
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,320
We have to talk about this.

215
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,960
Maybe it's better for you to mind your own business.

216
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,799
And I take care of my own problems.

217
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,159
Uncle Dani is waiting for me in the USA.

218
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,120
When will you come back?

219
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,039
The school starts in two weeks.

220
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,960
I am taking a break from school.

221
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,960
I want to focus on my passion.

222
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,319
Raga, please.

223
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,680
You still have to focus on school.

224
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,519
Don't leave.

225
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,920
At least I'm still honest,

226
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,279
and not secretive like you.

227
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,000
Once again, I emphasize,

228
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,839
the news is not true.

229
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:39,319
I always prioritize your happiness.

230
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,480
And my plan to adopt Fely

231
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:43,400
is not because of the news.

232
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:46,720
Because your mom and I want to have a daughter.

233
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,799
And because I am sure

234
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,359
Fely's presence here will make our family better.

235
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,960
So, all that news...

236
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:58,759
It's fake. That's fake news.

237
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,279
I emphasize once again,

238
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,480
that is fake news.

239
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:09,759
So we got angry at Fely for nothing?

240
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:18,200
Fely must be confused and scared now.

241
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,400
Where is Fely now?

242
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,039
Does any of you know?

243
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:37,799
Excuse me.

244
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,440
Enjoy your drink.

245
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:47,279
THE FALL OF THE FAMOUS LAWYER'S IMAGE

246
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:56,440
JOHAN'S ILLEGITIMATE CHILD WAS HIDDEN IN THIS ORPHANAGE?

247
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:23,039
MR. JOHAN INCOMING CALL

248
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:59,758
RAMA INCOMING CALL

249
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:01,079
RAMA CONNECTED

250
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,079
Yes, what is it, Rama?

251
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:06,839
Sorry to interrupt, Sir.

252
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,319
I want to report

253
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,440
that the rumors that are circulating

254
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,160
are increasing the attack against the firm, Sir.

255
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,359
And if we let it be,

256
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,039
I’m afraid it will make our firm’s image go bad.

257
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,758
HAVE YOU HEARD THE NEWS

258
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:31,440
THAT LAWYER JOHAN WINSTON HAS AN ILLEGITIMATE CHILD?

259
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:33,400
I CAN'T FATHOM MR. WINSTON ACTING LIKE THAT

260
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:36,039
I AM DISAPPOINTED. I THOUGHT JOHAN WAS HONEST

261
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:42,758
AS A LAWYER, IT'S ALL ABOUT MORALITY

262
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:48,599
UNEXPECTEDLY, JOHAN HAD POOR MORAL STANDARDS

263
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,960
RAMA CONNECTED

264
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,799
Immediately write a clarification.

265
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,640
And most importantly

266
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:05,319
find out who is spreading these rumors.

267
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,400
Yes, Sir.

268
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:25,319
FELY, PLEASE.

269
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,160
COME HOME.

270
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,440
I APOLOGIZE.

271
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:37,119
FELY? WHERE ARE YOU?

272
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:38,680
WE'RE WORRIED.

273
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,599
PLEASE FORGIVE US.

274
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,480
WE BELIEVE THE NEWS IS NOT TRUE.

275
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,240
FELY, I'M SORRY.

276
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:54,519
I GOT CARRIED AWAY.

277
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,119
I SHOULD'VE LISTENED TO YOUR EXPLANATION FIRST.

278
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:05,119
HI FELY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? PLEASE FORGIVE US.

279
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,599
NEWESTNEWSINDO TAGGED YOU IN A POST

280
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:22,960
THIS IS THE ILLEGITIMATE CHILD OF LAWYER JOHAN WINSTON

281
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:27,495
THIS IS THE ILLEGITIMATE CHILD OF LAWYER JOHAN WINSTON

282
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:30,559
IT TURNS OUT THAT HE HIDES THE KID IN THE ORPHANAGE

283
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,240
THE ILLEGITIMATE CHILD LOOKS LIKE THIS

284
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:15,000
MR. ANDREAS

285
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,680
KASIH IBU ORPHANAGE

286
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:23,799
Be careful.

287
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,119
Fely?

288
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,559
Where are you going?

289
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:32,920
I'm going to the Winstons' house.

290
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,359
Last night I thought it through.

291
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,400
There's no harm for me to go back to my father.

292
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,839
That's something I've always wanted.

293
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:50,440
I will always support whatever decision you make.

294
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,960
Thank you.

295
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,079
I'll answer this call.

296
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,319
Hello, Raga?

297
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,319
Fely? Finally, you answer the phone.

298
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,640
Where are you?

299
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,440
I’m on my way back.

300
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:09,559
There’s no one home.

301
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,535
I'll pick you up, okay? You're at the orphanage, right?

302
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:13,519
It's okay. No need.

303
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:15,079
I can walk.

304
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,599
Where are you?

305
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,640
I'm in the auto shop.

306
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,880
It's okay, I'll just pick you up, okay?

307
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,799
No need.

308
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,920
We'll meet there, okay?

309
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:29,119
I'll go first.

310
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,559
Be careful.

311
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,799
-Peace be upon you. -And peace be upon you.

312
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:44,119
-Raga? -Ouch.

313
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,079
-Ouch. -Does it hurt?

314
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,880
No, it hurts more to be scolded by you.

315
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,519
Okay then. Let's go.

316
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,440
You haven't finished your work yet.

317
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:00,480
It's better if we just talk here.

318
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:03,519
It's okay, we talk at another place.

319
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:05,880
How can you see me working?

320
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,599
That's okay. I love watching you work.

321
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,640
Okay.

322
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,640
Regarding the rumors...

323
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,720
Yeah.

324
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,160
Dad has told me everything, and it's been cleared.

325
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,039
So, we no longer believe

326
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,519
those rumors.

327
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:44,599
I'm sorry for judging you at that time.

328
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,640
I'm really sorry.

329
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:51,160
That's okay. I also understand your position.

330
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,359
But

331
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,559
there's something I have to tell you.

332
00:25:57,759 --> 00:25:59,279
What is it?

333
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,880
Yesterday someone came to the orphanage.

334
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:06,440
And he...

335
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,039
"He?"

336
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:12,799
He's my real father.

337
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,640
At first I was doubtful.

338
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:22,240
But after he told the story

339
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:25,640
and showed me a photo of my mother,

340
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,920
I felt he was speaking the truth.

341
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:32,119
Ms. Ida also said that the person in the photo was really my mother.

342
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,559
I’m happy for you.

343
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,279
But there's something else I need to tell you.

344
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,400
I’m moving to Surabaya.

345
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,759
My dad wants me to live with him there.

346
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:56,400
So, you want to move to Surabaya now?

347
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,279
Tomorrow my dad will pick me up.

348
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,759
Wait a minute. I want to go to the toilet first.

349
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,720
Calm down, Raga.

350
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,000
You have to support whatever Fely decides.

351
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:33,359
You can't be selfish.

352
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,160
Fely?

353
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:51,119
Are you using my design?

354
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,000
Yeah. Cool, right?

355
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,240
Now it's my turn.

356
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:57,440
So you want to learn to drive?

357
00:27:58,079 --> 00:27:59,359
Now?

358
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,640
You don't have any more time, right? Tomorrow, your dad will pick you up.

359
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,759
Get inside.

360
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:14,319
You sit there, I sit here?

361
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,400
Yes, you're behind the wheel.

362
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:18,759
-But... -It's okay. Do you know

363
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:21,279
the best way to study?

364
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:23,720
Learning by doing. Okay?

365
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,240
Relax. I still want to live. I will take care of you.

366
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:28,920
Okay. Come on.

367
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:32,640
Get inside.

368
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,200
Okay. Just relax.

369
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:40,000
Let's begin.

370
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,960
-Wear the seat belt first. -Okay.

371
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,880
Okay.

372
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:51,240
N means neutral. R means reverse.

373
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:53,519
Remember to hit the brakes.

374
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:11,200
Think of the body of this car as your own body.

375
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:15,239
It's just a matter of how you adapt to the circumstances around you.

376
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:18,359
Plus, enjoy the ride.

377
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:22,759
Just like if we like someone.

378
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,160
Just enjoy the ride.

379
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,839
But in my opinion

380
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,799
travel companions are also important.

381
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:36,000
If it's with the right person, it's definitely fun.

382
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,680
You already have a fun travel companion, right?

383
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,960
Okay.

384
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,319
Hit the brakes.

385
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,720
-That's it. -That's it?

386
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,319
Just drive.

387
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:03,599
-Come on. -Now?

388
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,440
Tomorrow.

389
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,000
-Of course now. -Okay.

390
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,279
-Brake, right? -Yes, brake.

391
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,559
Fely?

392
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,519
Fely. Seriously!

393
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,920
Oh my God!

394
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,599
That's close.

395
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,240
-What are you doing? -I’m driving properly.

396
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:29,799
Okay.

397
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,039
Watch me. Look at my feet.

398
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:34,440
The right one... Come here. Okay.

399
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:37,880
The right one is the gas and the left is the brake.

400
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:41,240
So, you release the brake slowly.

401
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:43,160
If there's anything...

402
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,720
Please take good care of Fely.

403
00:30:58,519 --> 00:30:59,960
Certainly.

404
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:01,519
Turns out that letting go

405
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,759
of the people we love, hurts so much.

406
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:07,759
Do you really like her?

407
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,160
Why are we here?

408
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,880
We're going to Surabaya, right?

409
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,640
This is a surprise from me.

410
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,759
I think it would be more fun to have a vacation here.

411
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:22,960
Help me double-check

412
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,839
Mr. Andreas profile.

413
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,559
Is he Fely's biological father or not?
