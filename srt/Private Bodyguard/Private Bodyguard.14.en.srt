SAY NO TO BULLY!

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:11,880
So you’re really seeing her today?

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,400
Yes, as you said,

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,160
before she leaves for Surabaya.

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,519
Good luck.

8
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:18,839
Thank you.

9
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,960
Fely? What are you doing?

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,399
Raga?

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,679
Why are you here?

12
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:30,679
What's with the climbing?

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,920
And there are lots of house guards.

14
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,000
But it's a bit strange.

15
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:36,840
Why does my dad have to do that?

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,840
In fact, I'm sure

17
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,799
if my dad finds out you're here,

18
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,039
he definitely won't like it.

19
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:45,399
I also love all things butterfly-related.

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,640
Fely?

21
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:48,399
I love you.

22
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:51,200
Not as a sibling.

23
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:53,359
Or a friend.

24
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:55,280
I really love you, Fely.

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,479
Rama, please confirm again if Andreas Geralda is still alive or not.

26
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,679
She's ready to be taken.

27
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,439
When do you want to harvest the organs? Tomorrow, right?

28
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:11,400
-Hey! -Chase her.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Oh my God!

30
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:23,120
Please! Help!

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,000
Please don't hurt me! Help!

32
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:28,519
-Don't! -Hold her!

33
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:31,159
-No! Help! -Get inside!

34
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:33,719
-Get inside! -No!

35
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:36,200
-No! -Get inside!

36
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,000
Why?

37
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,479
Who are you?

38
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:36,879
It's been over 15 minutes,

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,599
why isn't Fely here yet?

40
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:40,879
Sir?

41
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:44,520
I have managed to get the latest information about Andre.

42
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:46,039
Your guess is correct.

43
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,319
It turns out

44
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,360
that Andreas Geralda is dead.

45
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:51,360
So who is the man with Fely?

46
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,319
I can't be sure yet.

47
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:58,439
I also found out that Andre

48
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,039
has a younger brother, sir.

49
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,439
His younger brother's name is Andra Geralda.

50
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,199
And according to the data I managed to collect,

51
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,240
Andra has a dark history.

52
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,080
Since his college days,

53
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:11,639
he has often been in and out of prison due to drugs.

54
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:15,240
He is even suspected of being involved in the human trafficking business.

55
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,120
-Hello, Dad? -Are you with Fely?

56
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:31,639
Jordan said yesterday, you went and see her.

57
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,800
Yes.

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,560
I'm just making sure Fely is fine.

59
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,919
We promised to have lunch together

60
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,639
but Fely hasn't come yet.

61
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,759
It's not about that.

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,039
So what is it about?

63
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,240
You have to promise, don't be reckless after hearing this.

64
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,080
What is it?

65
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,439
Andre, who is with Fely, is not her biological father.

66
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,159
So, who is he?

67
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,680
I don't know either, but I suspect

68
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,599
he is Andre's younger brother.

69
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,919
So...

70
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,599
But he's not a good person.

71
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,599
-Why are you just telling me now? -Because I've only found out now.

72
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:13,400
Raga, don't do anything stupid.

73
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:16,319
I will take care of it soon and report to the police...

74
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,079
I heard that the child was almost gone yesterday?

75
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,240
No. She is safe.

76
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,720
She's inside.

77
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,199
And she is ready to be taken.

78
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,680
What's her name?

79
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,399
Her name is Felysia.

80
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:46,480
She is usually called Fely.

81
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,920
Let's go inside.

82
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,959
So you can see for yourself.

83
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,199
Okay.

84
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:59,439
EPISODE 14 PRIVATE BODYGUARDS

85
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,120
Hello?

86
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,439
Hello, Raga?

87
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,680
Where are you?

88
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,720
We've heard everything from dad earlier.

89
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,639
What can we do to help?

90
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,319
No need. You guys just stay there.

91
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,399
It's dangerous here.

92
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,839
Raga?

93
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,360
You're at Fely's place, right?

94
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,120
Listen, Raga.

95
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,079
With or without your permission,

96
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,480
we're going there anyway!

97
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,720
We're just telling you.

98
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:25,560
Raga please, you have to share your location!

99
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:28,000
With the four of us, we can help Fely better.

100
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,680
If you don't tell us,

101
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:33,120
we will visit the villas there one by one.

102
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,399
-Hurry, Raga. -Okay.

103
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,360
Okay. I'll share the location.

104
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:44,879
Here it is!

105
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,120
This is it!

106
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,920
Come on, let's go!

107
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,279
Tonight, someone

108
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,920
will take this child to the surgery location.

109
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,079
After that,

110
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,639
I will pay the remaining 50 percent.

111
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,560
I'm still looking for the other kids.

112
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,759
I'll let you know later.

113
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:15,040
But yesterday you said

114
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,720
that she is your nephew.

115
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,600
So, you guys really are family?

116
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:25,839
There is no family in my life dictionary.

117
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,480
Okay. Let's find something to eat first.

118
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,040
While discussing the prices of other children.

119
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,560
Okay.

120
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,680
Hey! Shut up!

121
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,279
I'll beat you!

122
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,199
Fely? Are you okay?

123
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,720
Hang on.

124
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,439
Okay.

125
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:37,559
Get the rope.

126
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,720
Is this really the place?

127
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,559
Then what's next?

128
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,759
We have to be careful.

129
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,120
We'd better get off here.

130
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,879
Are you sure? Get off here?

131
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,360
Yes.

132
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,279
Guys,

133
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,200
isn’t that Raga’s car?

134
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,679
Let's go in now, while it's quiet.

135
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:29,960
What if this is a trap? What if they know we're coming?

136
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,679
Let's try this way.

137
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:53,679
Slowly. Helga?

138
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,360
Watch your back.

139
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,519
Okay.

140
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:10,159
That's them.

141
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,559
I have an idea.

142
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:26,519
Slap again. Blue.

143
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,240
Good.

144
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,159
Shoot again.

145
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,080
Yes it is.

146
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:37,919
Hey!

147
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:38,720
Hey!

148
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,360
Where are you going?

149
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,320
I am sorry.

150
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:44,200
This is my brother, he is lost.

151
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,639
Please understand

152
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,360
because

153
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,440
he is blind.

154
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,519
Don't lie to me. Come with me!

155
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,200
Let's go! Hey!

156
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:55,639
-Where are you going? -Sorry, he's deaf too.

157
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,519
-Hey! -My brother is blind.

158
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:01,679
-Come here! -He also can't hear.

159
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,799
You get out too!

160
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:04,399
-Quick! -He can't hear you!

161
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,080
-He didn't hear you. -Come here!

162
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,559
Get out! Don't fake it!

163
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:09,960
Quick!

164
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:15,720
Untie her!

165
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:17,120
Are you okay?

166
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:20,279
Let her go.

167
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,480
-Come on, quickly. -Let's go.

168
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,720
Get out!

169
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,879
Get out quickly!

170
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,639
Let's go!

171
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,600
Hey!

172
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:43,799
Hey!

173
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,440
Hey!

174
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:46,799
Damn it!

175
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:50,120
Everyone is fine?

176
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,639
You're kidding!

177
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,279
I feel great!

178
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,360
My adrenaline hasn't dropped since before!

179
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,039
Guys, thank you.

180
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:15,600
What is it?

181
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:16,679
What?

182
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,000
What is it?

183
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,919
One moment.

184
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,759
What happened?

185
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,679
What is it?

186
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,240
Damn it. The tire is flat.

187
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,559
Flat?

188
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,320
Damn. I didn't bring a spare tire.

189
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,360
We are quite far from the villa.

190
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,559
Hopefully they don't catch up.

191
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:43,039
Hey.

192
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,120
There are people!

193
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,639
We can ask for help.

194
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:55,000
That's the thug. They are still chasing us!

195
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,360
What then?

196
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,559
We fight them!

197
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,879
We run into the forest.

198
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,039
We'll fight them there!

199
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,200
Good. Let's split up.

200
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,519
Jordan, go over there. Helga and Naviro, go there!

201
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,120
-Fely with me! -Go!

202
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,200
That's them!

203
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:15,279
They are spreading.

204
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,559
Split in two groups!

205
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:17,799
Okay!

206
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,120
Raga.

207
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:52,279
Hey!

208
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:56,720
Where do you want to run?

209
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,039
Raga?

210
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:22,519
All of you surrender!

211
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,039
Or she will die.

212
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,200
All of you go over there.

213
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:04,600
DON'T YOU EVER BOTHER FELY ANYMORE!!

214
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:09,840
Are you okay?

215
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,600
Thank you for helping me.

216
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,480
It's our obligation.

217
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:21,159
Why is your father like this?

218
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,320
He's not my father.

219
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:25,600
Turns out he's my uncle.

220
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:26,559
I just didn't expect

221
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:28,840
that he is so heartless to me.

222
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,320
That means he's really bad. Using your father identity

223
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,039
to kidnap you!

224
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:37,799
It's okay. Don't think about it.

225
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,080
The important thing is, you're safe now.

226
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,519
I thought I actually met my birth parents.

227
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:47,679
But it turns out I have to start again from nothing.

228
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:53,559
Calm down, Fely.

229
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:57,240
You're not alone.

230
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,480
We're here.

231
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,279
Now we take care of you.

232
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:04,159
All of us.

233
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,320
-Hello, Dad. -Where are you?

234
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,679
Everybody is safe.

235
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,440
Raga and Fely are already with us.

236
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,360
Dad, can you send someone?

237
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,399
Raga's car has a flat tire. And my car is still near the villa.

238
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:26,000
But we can't go there.

239
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,639
No need to worry.

240
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,679
I'll send some man now. I'll let you know.

241
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,120
Alright, Dad.

242
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,399
Damn it!

243
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,639
How could I have gotten careless?

244
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,440
No.

245
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,879
They won't be able to get away from Andra.

246
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,159
No.

247
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,240
I WON'T STOP BOTHERING FELY

248
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:01,279
I WON'T STOP BOTHERING FELY!

249
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,920
I WILL MAKE YOUR LIFE EVEN MORE UNEASY!

250
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:10,359
FELY WON'T BE ABLE TO GET AWAY FROM ME!

251
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,799
UNLESS YOU GIVE ME THE MONEY I ASKED FOR.

252
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,720
HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU WANT?

253
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:33,599
FIRST, YOU MEET ME HERE

254
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,319
SECOND, YOU COME ALONE!

255
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,440
DON'T TRY TO REPORT IT TO THE POLICE OR FELY WILL SUFFER!

256
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:45,480
I'LL LET YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT OF MONEY I ASK FOR

257
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,519
Excuse me, sir.

258
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:57,039
I received information that the villa has been secured.

259
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,640
Okay. My son's car is still there.

260
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,200
Please take it home.

261
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:02,279
Okay, sir!

262
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,279
I want you to do one more thing for me.

263
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,279
-Peace be upon you. -And peace be upon you.

264
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:27,039
Thank goodness, I am relieved!

265
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:28,599
Are you okay?

266
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,119
Especially you, Fely.

267
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,079
Thank goodness you're safe!

268
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:33,519
Are you hurt?

269
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:35,519
Not at all, sir.

270
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,400
Thank you, sir.

271
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,920
Thank you everyone

272
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:43,400
for helping me.

273
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,799
I don't know what would happen if it weren't for you guys.

274
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:53,279
Sit down. Come on, sit down.

275
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,480
The villa has been secured.

276
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,680
And your car is being brought home.

277
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,000
Forgive me.

278
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,359
Because I was too late to anticipate this.

279
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:20,880
I also wasn't careful about

280
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,440
the information regarding your uncle, Andra.

281
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,319
There's nothing to regret, sir.

282
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:29,839
The important thing is that now I'm home and can be together again.

283
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,640
But don't worry,

284
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:34,400
that person won't be able to hurt you again.

285
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,759
I'll make sure of it!

286
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:37,039
Thank you, sir.

287
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,440
Thank you for your kindness and your family's kindness to me.

288
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:44,839
Excuse me, sir.

289
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:55,079
You guys eat first.

290
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,160
Clean yourself up.

291
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,359
I have some work to take care of.

292
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,759
-Sir! -Is the amount correct?

293
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,119
It is, sir.

294
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,200
But forgive me.

295
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:19,759
Are you sure?

296
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,000
That's a big number.

297
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,359
Can Andra be trusted?

298
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:28,359
He's already a fugitive.

299
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,240
As soon as he received that amount of money, he won't take any chances.

300
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,880
He will go as far as he can.

301
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,839
Okay.

302
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,519
Okay, I'll wait at the location.

303
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:47,960
Wait!

304
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:51,440
As long as you promise to stay away from Fely.

305
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:00,680
Dad?

306
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,759
Are you sure you want to give money to that person?

307
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:06,200
This is for Fely's safety.

308
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,839
-Isn't it finished? -With this money

309
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,440
all problems can be solved.

310
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,759
He won't bother Fely and our family anymore.

311
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,759
-I am coming along. -No, you can't.

312
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,119
You take care of Fely and your siblings.

313
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,559
Okay.

314
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,440
But share your location to me.

315
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:25,160
So I can monitor you and know that you are safe.

316
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,920
Be careful, Dad!

317
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:44,839
Guys.

318
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,440
Dad's gone.

319
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,440
-Where? -He has gone to see Andre.

320
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:50,999
He wants to give him some money so he won't bother us anymore.

321
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:52,240
Will he stop?

322
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,696
He said after this he would go far away. He has become a fugitive.

323
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,559
But there's still no guarantee, right?

324
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:59,640
Then what should we do?

325
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:02,359
You guys just calm down here. I will follow him.

326
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,160
-Okay? -I am coming along!

327
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,400
Me too!

328
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:07,400
Me too!

329
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,559
Especially me!

330
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,799
If anything happened to Mr. Johan, I'd regret it for the rest of my life.

331
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:14,720
Okay then. Let's go!

332
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,759
Take the money and never bother Fely and my family again!

333
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:07,880
You're on the police's wanted list, right?

334
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,920
You definitely don't want to get caught.

335
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:14,039
I like the direct ones like this.

336
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,000
Be patient.

337
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:20,720
What's the hurry? Where are you going?

338
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,599
I don't need to count this anymore, right?

339
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:35,160
I'm happy to do business with you.

340
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,359
Okay. Fine.

341
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,920
That's also okay, right?

342
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:50,440
Yes.

343
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:52,039
Your phone too!

344
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,880
No way!

345
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:55,279
Aren't you satisfied yet?

346
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,720
Aren't you satisfied yet?

347
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,640
If you say I'm satisfied,

348
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,960
for the time being, I'm satisfied.

349
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,640
But...

350
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:10,759
I don't know,

351
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,440
maybe I need something else tomorrow.

352
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,079
A house or

353
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,039
maybe a car.

354
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,920
By the way,

355
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,640
why are you like this to Fely?

356
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,216
Even though she is not your biological child.

357
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,079
Because I love her. Not like you!

358
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,119
Okay.

359
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,960
All set.

360
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,799
It's time for me to go.

361
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,599
Remember,

362
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,079
if you dare to report this to the police,

363
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,799
Fely will pay for it.

364
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,880
Wait!

365
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,160
Fely?

366
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,440
Yeah?

367
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,200
What is it?

368
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,079
How could you be so heartless to do this to me?

369
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:09,480
This isn't a matter of whether I'm heartless or not, Fely.

370
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:12,160
Life is hard and cruel.

371
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:15,359
How old are you? 15?

372
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,480
17?

373
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:22,640
You don't know anything about life yet.

374
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:29,319
There is blood and sweat that must be sacrificed

375
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,400
to survive.

376
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,440
Understand?

377
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:38,119
But at least you owe me an explanation about my father and mother.

378
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:41,359
-Is it true that my mother is dead? -I do not know!

379
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:45,640
I haven't seen Andre and his wife for 10 years.

380
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:47,359
But I do know one thing.

381
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,759
If they left you in that orphanage,

382
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,880
one day they will bring you home again.

383
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:55,240
So, I don't know anything.

384
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:56,480
I was surprised too,

385
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,440
hearing the news that you were Johan's illegitimate child.

386
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:01,480
I thought your parents had picked you up.

387
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,680
You are a liar.

388
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,440
Whatever!

389
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:11,079
What's certain is that I don't know where your father and mother are.

390
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,160
One more thing.

391
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,920
See you again, Fely.

392
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:28,079
Because this won't be our last meeting.

393
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,400
I can't accept you, Raga.

394
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,160
-Why? -Sorry, Raga.

395
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,079
Tell me if you don't feel the same way.

396
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:23,480
I can't accept you.

397
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,359
Please do not bother me anymore.

398
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:27,480
Fely?

399
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:28,759
Actually,

400
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,359
I've liked you since the first time we met.

401
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,279
And I hope,

402
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:39,920
you have the same feeling.
