00:00:56,325 --> 00:01:00,300
The Story of Ming Lan

2
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,580
Episode 46

3
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,702
This one is the Funing Palace Hall.

4
00:01:07,086 --> 00:01:08,366
That part is the Chongzheng Palace Hall.

5
00:01:09,455 --> 00:01:11,336
In the front, there is still the Chuigong Palace Hall.

6
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,920
Also, the imperial garden is in the front too.

7
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,880
When the flower season comes,

8
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,750
the blossoming flowers are really so pretty.

9
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,640
Stop restraining yourself.

10
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,720
In this royal palace,

11
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,525
besides my brother-in-law

12
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,280
only Empress Dowager is not so nice.

13
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,200
But she's not here now.

14
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,760
Eunuch Zhu.

15
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,000
Greetings, Your Ladyships.

16
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,680
Empress Dowager sent me to ask

17
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,480
you two to go to Baoci Palace.

18
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,800
We came here today

19
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,471
to thank our granted marriages.

20
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,360
Sister is still waiting for us.

21
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,720
Her Highness Empress is now in Baoci Palace.

22
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,200
This morning

23
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,400
when Empress went to greet Empress Dowager,

24
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:06,850
she mentioned

25
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,120
that you two will be here today.

26
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,450
Her Highness Empress Dowager

27
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,200
then especially made Her Highness Empress stay.

28
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,520
May Your Ladyships go there to meet them.

29
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:14,880
Please.

30
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,240
What's wrong?

31
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,640
You don't know.

32
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,320
Empress Dowager

33
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,600
dislike me or my sister.

34
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,120
Whenever she sees me,

35
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,440
she will lecture me endlessly.

36
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,600
Then... won't I

37
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,960
face the disaster too?

38
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,000
Please.

39
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,200
Let's go.

40
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,480
Sorry.

41
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,200
These two ladies

42
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,640
grew up by my side.

43
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,840
Seeing they're getting older,

44
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,280
I'm thinking about let them

45
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,720
attend to the emperor

46
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,320
and stay in the palace.

47
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,320
In this way,

48
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,800
it will be more convenient

49
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,440
for them to frequently visit me.

50
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,360
His Majesty is already quite old.

51
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:21,920
I'm afraid that

52
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,360
it will waste the youth of such beautiful ladies.

53
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,720
Moreover, his children now—

54
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,400
Empress, don't worry.

55
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,000
The two of them are very obedient.

56
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,960
I just want them

57
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,920
to stay in the palace,

58
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,480
so it will be convenient for them

59
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,080
to frequently come here and chat with me.

60
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,120
You're right.

61
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,480
But His Majesty said that

62
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,360
he wants to decrease the number of palace servants

63
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,680
and expenditures

64
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,575
I'm afraid that we can't afford

65
00:03:52,575 --> 00:03:53,840
to keep too many of them.

66
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,960
You've already mentioned the emperor.

67
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,800
What else can I say?

68
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,680
Just let them go then.

69
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,400
Why not

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,520
send them to General Xiao Zheng's house

71
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,480
the house of State Uncle

72
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,760
and also, General Gu's house?

73
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,280
You two just go take them away.

74
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,725
We can't,

75
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,640
Empress Dowager.

76
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,200
The people by your side are precious ones.

77
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,680
We must meticulously help them arrange a good marriage.

78
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,200
How could you ask us

79
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,200
to just take them in?

80
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,800
This makes them have no proper status.

81
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,160
How precious can they be?

82
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,920
All are just maids.

83
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,440
I just want to

84
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,160
find them a good main mistress.

85
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,840
Let them live live a better life.

86
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,800
Also,

87
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,200
I still have a lot in my palace

88
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,920
who needs to be dismissed.

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,880
They've all followed me

90
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,040
for so many years.

91
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,520
I must arrange

92
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,040
the rest of their lives properly.

93
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,480
Madam Sheng.

94
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,120
I heard that

95
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,200
General Gu still doesn't have any concubine.

96
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,840
Why don't you take a few more with you?

97
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,360
Okay, okay.

98
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,600
I'm also tired now. It's time to rest.

99
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,880
Why are you smiling so much?

100
00:05:44,825 --> 00:05:46,465
Were my words

101
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,920
too absurd and laughable?

102
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,920
No,Empress Dowager.

103
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,840
I was thinking that...

104
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,200
that it was such a coincidence.

105
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,760
At home, there are also

106
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,120
a lot of marriages that must be arranged.

107
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,280
Moon God might

108
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,680
get too busy these days.

109
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,560
Really?

110
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,760
What marriage

111
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,600
is your family organizing?

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,280
Informing Your Highness,

113
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,920
a few days ago, my husband told me that

114
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,200
because the northern border requires

115
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:22,840
more guards to be stationed,

116
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,880
it's better that dispatched soldiers are allowed

117
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,920
to bring their families

118
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,960
to stabilize the military morale.

119
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,160
But there are still a lot of

120
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,400
young single soldiers

121
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,720
in the army.

122
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,400
They all approached and begged him.

123
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,520
My husband said

124
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,160
that I should look for some female attendants

125
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,600
and maidservants at home,

126
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,080
make both sides meet each other.

127
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,640
If anyone gets chosen,

128
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,760
and both are willing,

129
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,760
they can immediately marry.

130
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,920
I feel that

131
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,480
it was too coincidental

132
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,920
that my husband

133
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,720
and Your Highness have the same idea.

134
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,080
Second Brother really came up with

135
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,200
such a good idea!

136
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,316
Unruly!

137
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,680
Stop with your nonsense.

138
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,225
How could the personal attendants

139
00:07:03,225 --> 00:07:04,280
of Her Highness Empress Dowager

140
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,120
stumble themselves

141
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,520
and be married with a soldiers?

142
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,400
That's right.

143
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,550
They were all spoiled and raised

144
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,360
here in the palace.

145
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,350
I'm afraid that

146
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,225
they won't be able to endure the hardship

147
00:07:18,225 --> 00:07:19,375
of being exposed to the wind

148
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,240
and sand in the border.

149
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,640
Thinking about it,

150
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,275
there are still a lot of young captains

151
00:07:25,275 --> 00:07:25,800
in the army.

152
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,800
Later, if their husbands get to earn

153
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,030
some military achievements and returns,

154
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,920
maybe Empress Dowager will have some more

155
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:31,880
madams with conferred titles

156
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,960
by her side.

157
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,360
In my opinion,

158
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,080
that's better than being someone's concubine.

159
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,720
After you said those,

160
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,000
I remembered something.

161
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,400
Before, when the former emperor died,

162
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,640
the palace was initially

163
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,000
planning to dismiss some people.

164
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,200
Now that a coincidental fate

165
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,520
like this has appeared,

166
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,650
rather than letting them have no place

167
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,200
to settle,

168
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,760
it is indeed better to do that.

169
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,050
Won't that be a perfect ending

170
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:08,720
for both predicament?

171
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,240
Your Highness, what do you think?

172
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,320
You've already mentioned the past emperor.

173
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,680
What else can I say?

174
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,840
Fine.

175
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,160
Just do it that way.

176
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,800
This thing

177
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,400
is Madam Sheng's idea.

178
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,240
Let her handle it then.

179
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,920
Why did you come?

180
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,320
I heard that Empress Dowager called you away.

181
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,440
How come you know everything?

182
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,720
Do you still remember

183
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,480
that eunuch you met

184
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,360
during the palace siege?

185
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,600
I do. Qingyun, right?

186
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,760
I recommended him

187
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,720
to be a steward today.

188
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,800
What's going on here?

189
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,000
I...

190
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,280
seemed to have brought you trouble.

191
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,400
How is that bringing me trouble?

192
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,560
This is earning me more honor!

193
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,300
I just'm afraid that it may foil the plan

194
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,000
of Empress Dowager,

195
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,640
she will hate you.

196
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,600
It was you who foiled her plan,

197
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,760
so why would she hate me?

198
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,240
We are as one body.

199
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,560
With me being this insensible,

200
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,520
wasn't it taught by you?

201
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,360
You finally grew up.

202
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,960
You know that you are me,

203
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,800
I am you.

204
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,080
With just those words,

205
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,680
even if Empress Dowager goes after me for this,

206
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,720
I'll accept it.

207
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,480
It's your matter at first.

208
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,600
I was just included in

209
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,400
passing by Empress Dowager.

210
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,720
Didn't you just say earlier

211
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,440
that you are me, and I am you?

212
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,625
That we are as one body?

213
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,680
Why must Empress Dowager do this?

214
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,775
In that palace siege,

215
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,440
if not because of His Majesty and his son

216
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,175
charging into the imperial city

217
00:10:25,175 --> 00:10:26,280
and rescuing the former emperor,

218
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,640
the consequences are unimaginable.

219
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,250
It's not easy that the wind and waves

220
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,160
have calmed down,

221
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,080
so why would they still come up with these torments?

222
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,880
Calm wind and waves.

223
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,640
How can things be that easy?

224
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,325
The past emperor governed

225
00:10:42,325 --> 00:10:43,600
with benevolence and generosity.

226
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,960
Of course, Empress Dowager hoped that

227
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,360
His Majesty will imitate the past emperor.

228
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,680
Walk the same path as the past emperor.

229
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,320
But His Majesty is resolute and steadfast.

230
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,080
He insisted on reforms.

231
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,325
Empress Dowager, of course,

232
00:10:56,325 --> 00:10:57,080
would be unhappy about it.

233
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,920
Resolute and steadfast?

234
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,920
Was it the suggestion

235
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,920
of that Prince Huan?

236
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,040
Prince Huan is full of great aspirations.

237
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,040
He saw how deeply rooted

238
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,680
the malpractices are in the government.

239
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,880
It must be changed.

240
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,280
Not mention anything else,

241
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,325
just in the army,

242
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,840
after taking over the Imperial Jin Army,

243
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,560
I saw so many shortcomings.

244
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,720
Getting salaries without working and steal the army's food.

245
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,650
occupying the fileds of citizens.

246
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,440
The military weapons warehouse is mostly empty.

247
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,150
Using soldier's paying

248
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:35,925
to lend money at high interests.

249
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,520
So numerous dreadful incidents.

250
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,525
Don't even talk about

251
00:11:39,525 --> 00:11:40,435
how the local court and prison officials

252
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,075
severely exact the wealth

253
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:41,680
of the citizens under them.

254
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,275
State Uncle married the daughter

255
00:11:50,275 --> 00:11:51,120
of Duke Ying of the State.

256
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,600
Afterwards, he took in the little sister

257
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,560
of his deceased wife as a concubine.

258
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,640
Husband and wife are not getting along well.

259
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,850
We are newywed.

260
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,440
She wants to add another person between us,

261
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,168
so that

262
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,200
I will also incite a huge quarrel with you.

263
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,560
Right. Right.

264
00:12:08,025 --> 00:12:09,465
But instead, you

265
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,560
didn't cause a ruckus at all.

266
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,600
You even took away her people

267
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,560
and cut off her words.

268
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,025
Still those words,

269
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,240
you're my tactical adviser.

270
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,480
Let's go to Fan House to have a drink.

271
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,280
Hey, no time for drinking!

272
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,175
Drinking again?

273
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,800
There are still a few

274
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,640
beautiful and delicate ladies

275
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,500
in the adjacent courtyard.

276
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,120
There are still a lot of things to do.

277
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,080
Now,

278
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,040
we still have some time to have drinks.

279
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm afraid that in the future, there won't be any.

280
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,840
Let's go. We'll go today.

281
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,600
You...

282
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,975
His Majesty and Empress Dowager

283
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,720
are fighting for power.

284
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,640
It's either military or money matter.

285
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,640
I'm sure that it will be a fierce battle.

286
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,160
Prince Huan and his father have been kind to me.

287
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,160
I'm afraid that from now on,

288
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,840
our family won't have

289
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,760
any peaceful days.

290
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,000
It was still a clear sky earlier.

291
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,240
How come there's now thunder?

292
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,080
It's rainning.

293
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,560
The sky will be changing.

294
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,800
Your Majesty,

295
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,960
recently, the empire has started to be peaceful

296
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,680
and the goverment has slowly stabilized.

297
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,050
Although most of the rebel prince's allies

298
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,080
have been killed or have surrendered,

299
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,600
I'm afraid that there are still remnants.

300
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,240
We mustn't stop and should make

301
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,280
a thorough investigation to purge them.

302
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,840
What Prime Minister Han said is reasonable.

303
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,720
Why don't you

304
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,520
recommend someone to handle it?

305
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,160
I recommend—

306
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,675
Qi Heng, the newly promoted imperial censor

307
00:13:59,675 --> 00:14:01,040
of the Censor Academy,

308
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,200
has a memorial submitted.

309
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,900
He firmly narrated a method

310
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,680
of eliminating the rebel faction.

311
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,000
Your Majesty,

312
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,840
don't you want to hear his words?

313
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,280
Call him then.

314
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,050
Calling

315
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,450
for Imperial Censor Qi Heng

316
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:23,040
of the Censor Academy to enter the palace!

317
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,960
I, Qi Heng, greeting to Your Majesty!

318
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,850
Greeting to Empress Dowager!

319
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,800
The son of Princess Pingning

320
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,250
is indeed outstanding.

321
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,640
I have a memorial to report.

322
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,960
Say it.

323
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,360
The rebel prince willfully slaughtered the innocents,

324
00:15:17,575 --> 00:15:19,400
and the linkages are too vast.

325
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,400
I suggest to meticulously investigate

326
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,040
the accounting books of his royal manor.

327
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,475
Have those people written there

328
00:15:25,475 --> 00:15:26,880
with whom he had social interactions

329
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,320
called for interrogations,

330
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,675
to avoid anyone being missed.

331
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,520
I think that it's inappropriate.

332
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,600
Although this act will avoid anyone being missed,

333
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,825
it may overact.

334
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,275
We should find hard evidence first

335
00:15:37,275 --> 00:15:38,700
before investigating them one by one.

336
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,920
If we don't purge and punish them heavily,

337
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,475
stun the public with it,

338
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,725
I'm afraid that someone might imitate

339
00:15:42,725 --> 00:15:43,200
him in the future

340
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:44,600
and cause trouble again.

341
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,440
All the officials here

342
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,520
hate the rebel prince up to our bones.

343
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,100
But how come Lord Qi seems to suggest that

344
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,600
we should extend to implicate and punish

345
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,480
associates of his?

346
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,520
Being thorough in investigating the rebel faction

347
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,800
is for the stabilization of the government

348
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,000
and the purging of the remaining rebels.

349
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,440
Even if

350
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,720
half of the government officials are killed,

351
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,680
what benefit will I get from it?

352
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,160
In the past, you almost was married to...

353
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,680
I think Qi Heng's method isn't bad.

354
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,480
He is fair, loyal, and upright.

355
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,000
Just let him handle this matter.

356
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:22,975
I, Qi Heng,

357
00:16:22,975 --> 00:16:25,120
thank Your Majesty and Empress Dowager!

358
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,280
Now, Prime Minister Han

359
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,880
has really lifted a stone

360
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,040
to hit his own foot.

361
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,800
At first, asking Empress Dowager to listen

362
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,520
to court meetings was to stabilize the government.

363
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,375
Now,

364
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:50,825
the citizens are trusting

365
00:16:50,825 --> 00:16:51,550
the new imperial government

366
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,320
and there is peace everywhere,

367
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,120
but Empress Dowager refuse to withdraw

368
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,600
and hand over the jade seal.

369
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,520
Earlier, at Wende Palace Hall,

370
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,600
I couldn't even bear

371
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,880
to look at that face of His Majesty.

372
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,950
It's easier to invite the deity

373
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,160
but hard to send him off.

374
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,120
A few days ago, we just decided to

375
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,800
purge the remaining allies of that rebel prince.

376
00:17:10,525 --> 00:17:11,275
And today,

377
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,880
Empress Dowager already

378
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,720
had a Qi Heng to handle it.

379
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,680
It shows—

380
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,120
Take it easy.

381
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,125
Presently,

382
00:17:18,262 --> 00:17:19,160
the most important matter

383
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,120
is to get the jade seal back.

384
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,480
Once we have it, we then have just cause.

385
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,560
Of course, I know that.

386
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,480
Prime Minister Han,

387
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,750
Duke Ying of the State,

388
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,100
scholarly and military officials

389
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,000
have all tried to ask for it

390
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,440
numerous times, either openly or secretly.

391
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,920
But Empress Dowager

392
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,160
was able to block them all.

393
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,000
We can't really go steal it, right?

394
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,760
Of course, we can't forcefully take it away.

395
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,880
We must steal it intelligently.

396
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,080
Steal it intelligently.

397
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,960
Help me! Help me!

398
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,320
What are you doing?

399
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,320
Is there still any law?

400
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,160
Help me!

401
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,175
Help me!

402
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,600
Young Lord, Young lord!

403
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,280
What did

404
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,720
my son do?

405
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,480
That's right.

406
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,250
His Majesty has given a decree

407
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:04,575
to thoroughly investigate

408
00:18:04,575 --> 00:18:05,160
the remaining allies.

409
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,625
I'm just inviting them

410
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:07,160
to the local court

411
00:18:07,175 --> 00:18:07,750
for some questioning.

412
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,750
Impossible.

413
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,520
My house is full of loyal and righteous subjects.

414
00:18:10,825 --> 00:18:11,900
Since it's just for interrogation,

415
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,750
why they will be arrested by force

416
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,280
and hands are tied?

417
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,800
Young Lord,

418
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,440
our Qi and Gu families are relatives.

419
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,840
You should at least consider some affection

420
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,700
and give us some respect.

421
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,680
Indeed. Indeed.

422
00:18:21,775 --> 00:18:23,050
Even our Qi Family,

423
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,400
will not be spared from investigation.

424
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,375
I'll take my leave.

425
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,960
This... How could you be like this?!

426
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,640
What should we do?

427
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,200
Son! Father will save you!

428
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,360
This is a crime of rebellion!

429
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,880
This is a disaster of clan elimination!

430
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,880
Shut up!

431
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,280
How did Tingdi and Tingbing

432
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:51,475
have connection with the rebel prince?

433
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,680
What connection?

434
00:18:54,575 --> 00:18:55,125
They just

435
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,960
attended some poetry and singing sessions

436
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,075
in that rebel prince's manor.

437
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,640
Eldest Sister-in-law,

438
00:19:00,675 --> 00:19:02,240
you know very well the temper

439
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,650
and personalities of those two children.

440
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,800
For rebel,

441
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,800
even if you lend them 10 guts,

442
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:07,875
they won't dare too.

443
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,160
All are children of our house.

444
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,725
Of course, I know it.

445
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,080
Although there isn't a perfect person,

446
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,650
they were indeed children

447
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:18,800
who stayed within their bounds.

448
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,920
Yes. Yes.

449
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,760
That's right.

450
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,760
Eldest Sister-in-law,

451
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,175
you can't just watch and do nothing.

452
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,280
That Qi Heng just arrested them

453
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,240
without saying anything.

454
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,825
we are reletives

455
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,120
with him a few generations back.

456
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,880
You are giving me a difficult problem.

457
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,720
Our Gu and Qi family indeed had family ties

458
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,880
several generations ago.

459
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,520
But, that was after all so long ago.

460
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,280
We also don't usually

461
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,440
interact with each other.

462
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,480
In terms of affection,

463
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,875
it surely have already weakened.

464
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,920
If I just rashly go there

465
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,360
to beg there for leniency,

466
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:56,900
I'm afraid that I'll only be

467
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,600
embarrassingly get sent back.

468
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,440
It would then be harder

469
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,275
to seek them again.

470
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,640
What should we do?

471
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,680
Among us,

472
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:05,680
there really isn't anyone

473
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,900
who is dignified enough.

474
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,360
Only you have a status

475
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,360
whose words might be heard.

476
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,320
If you're unwilling to make this trip,

477
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,450
then it's watching us die

478
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,280
without offering any help!

479
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,760
Aren't we currently discussing about it?

480
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,450
Fourth Sister-in-law,

481
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,400
why must you say such harsh words?

482
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,640
I...

483
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,640
Okay.

484
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,760
Everyone, stop panicking.

485
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,440
What Eldest Sister-in-law said is reasonable.

486
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,120
It's just that...

487
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:35,000
the crime of rebellion isn't a minor matter.

488
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,825
If the two children get in trouble

489
00:20:36,825 --> 00:20:37,680
and sentenced for such crime,

490
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:39,850
it's still not known

491
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,840
if the marquis noble title

492
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,360
can be preserved or not.

493
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,920
In my opinion,

494
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,240
there is actually

495
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,640
one suitable person right now.

496
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,840
He can directly seek an audience with the emperor.

497
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,280
Eldest Sister-in-law is speaking

498
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,480
of Second Gu?

499
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,640
Eldest Sister-in-law doted Second Gu a lot.

500
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,200
Now,

501
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,880
just ask him to beg His Majesty for leniency.

502
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,320
Yes,

503
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,160
it might work before.

504
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,800
Now, he also have turned hostile against me.

505
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,065
They just got married

506
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,475
they alresdy transferred to another manor.

507
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,060
I'm afraid that

508
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,065
he won't be giving me such honor.

509
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,065
If you won't be honored,

510
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,600
the more we won't.

511
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:33,060
That lad had never faced us directly.

512
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,240
What should we do?

513
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,720
Can't do anything about it.

514
00:21:40,325 --> 00:21:41,875
The dabts of children

515
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,600
must be repaid by their parents.

516
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,840
Eldest's health

517
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,200
hasn't been good lately.

518
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:48,900
I heard that

519
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,440
he hasn't gotten out of bed for several days.

520
00:21:50,975 --> 00:21:52,347
I must go over and take a look.

521
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,350
You two

522
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,920
just sit here for a while.

523
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,120
This...

524
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,120
This...

525
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,400
What does she mean?

526
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,040
What else?

527
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,000
What she means is

528
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,000
we should just be shameless

529
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,520
and go look for that Gu Tingye.

530
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,575
Who told our sons

531
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,400
to commit such grave mistake?

532
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,680
Yesterday, someone told me that

533
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,160
the two brothers from Fourth and Fifth Houses

534
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,880
were arrested.

535
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,960
They said that they colluded with Prince Ni.

536
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,800
They even arrested members of the Gu family?

537
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,625
I heard the

538
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,400
person in-charge of uncovering the traitor,

539
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,080
is Yanruo.

540
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,680
I was joking with you.

541
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,080
I know Yanrou very well.

542
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,360
He's noble, virtuous and arrogant.

543
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,100
He will never take personal revenge.

544
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,560
Moreover,

545
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,520
he will never frame anyone.

546
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,200
Then...will you be implicated too?

547
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,680
Are you stupid?

548
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:22,425
I'm the person

549
00:23:22,425 --> 00:23:23,680
who shot and killed that rebel prince.

550
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,175
How could I be implicated?

551
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,880
Right! What am I afraid of?

552
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,640
You must be careful.

553
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,920
Did those people from the Fourth and Fifth Houses

554
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,200
come here to give you any problems?

555
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,760
Give me problems?

556
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:40,840
Shouldn't they find you

557
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,280
to plead for mercy?

558
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,840
Look for me to plead for mercy?

559
00:23:44,935 --> 00:23:46,160
I won't do that.

560
00:23:48,075 --> 00:23:49,035
How can I plead for mercy

561
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,840
for this rebel group?

562
00:23:49,975 --> 00:23:50,850
It's useless even if I say anything.

563
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,120
The members of the Gu family will definitely say

564
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,920
that you are lacking in feelings.

565
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,280
I already have a bad name.

566
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,040
I don't care if I have another one.

567
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,280
As for you, you must be extra wary.

568
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,000
Those women from the Fourth and Fifth Houses

569
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,080
are not like men.

570
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,080
I can get away from them.

571
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:11,880
Be wary of them

572
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,350
being too meticulous.

573
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,200
They can pester and irritate you to death.

574
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,080
I'm asking you this.

575
00:24:21,925 --> 00:24:23,800
Do you want to be involved in it?

576
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,475
Those rascals,

577
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,825
to say that they are status seekers,

578
00:24:27,825 --> 00:24:28,760
I would believe it.

579
00:24:29,775 --> 00:24:30,575
To say that

580
00:24:30,575 --> 00:24:31,760
they were colluding with that rebel prince,

581
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,840
even if we give them lots of courage,

582
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,775
they wouldn't dare to.

583
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,640
I'm aware of the situation then.

584
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,960
That Qi Heng

585
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,350
regards the Gu family

586
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,510
like a chicken coop and dog hole

587
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,400
and treats your brothers and cousins

588
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,600
like infamous pirates,

589
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,760
punished them like criminals and haul them away.

590
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,880
He's behaving atrociously.

591
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,840
Are you going to manage him or not?

592
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,320
Behaving atrociously?

593
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,480
Qi Heng was authorized by His Majesty

594
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,880
when he came to our house to interrogate.

595
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,240
Prime Minister

596
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,080
who was authorized to manage this case

597
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,520
was also handpicked by His Majesty.

598
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,920
You two dare to slander

599
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,440
important subjects of His Majesty here?

600
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,960
To add further,

601
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,600
since His Majesty decreed

602
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,240
to have this matter investigated,

603
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,960
but those who are involved

604
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,400
will be called up for questioning.

605
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,720
Other people can

606
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,920
be questioned,

607
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,440
why can't you?

608
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,400
But even so.

609
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,675
you now are a dignified subject

610
00:25:34,675 --> 00:25:35,880
in front of His Majesty.

611
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,200
The Gu family has difficulties.

612
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,360
Can't you say a few nice words

613
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,200
and plead for mercy

614
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,025
in front of offices?

615
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,600
If this is not His Majesty,

616
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,160
the Gu family will become a laughing stock.

617
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,275
That's right.

618
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,440
Please plead for mercy.

619
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,400
Do you think that

620
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,760
two evil creatures were falsely accused?

621
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,440
What do you mean?

622
00:25:59,825 --> 00:26:00,325
My father

623
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,760
went through arduous training and hard work

624
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,760
in the army for many years.

625
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,625
He was garrisoned at the borders

626
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:05,200
for more than 10 years.

627
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,520
His subordinates who were promoted

628
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,800
became good-for-nothings.

629
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,925
Did these people

630
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,840
participate in the rebellion?

631
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,750
Did our Gu family

632
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,320
ever recruited them?

633
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,440
If we did, this is a crime of rebellion!

634
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,480
Don't you

635
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,840
know us well?

636
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:26,400
We will never

637
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,560
let the Gu family's future generation

638
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,800
do something like this.

639
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,960
That's right.

640
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,160
Fourth Uncle, Fifth Uncle, stop saying like this.

641
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
When you usually manage your sons,

642
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,520
would these two brothers

643
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,560
of mine listen to you?

644
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:41,080
Out of those

645
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:41,920
ten harmful

646
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:42,900
and outrageous acts that they did,

647
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,600
I'm afraid you are only knew one.

648
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:45,750
You...

649
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,440
You! What nonsense are you spouting?

650
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,280
Although our sons good-for-nothings,

651
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,720
they will never

652
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,240
do such evil acts.

653
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,120
That's right.

654
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,920
Don't panic.

655
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,280
The prison is administered

656
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,600
by Liu Zhengjie.

657
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,840
I'm unable to leave my work

658
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,760
in the military camp,

659
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,000
so I had someone ask around.

660
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,720
He dared not say anything

661
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,040
except to tell me this information.

662
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,680
Tingdi and Tingbing

663
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,040
helped the rebel prince

664
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,040
buy a lot of Jiangnan women.

665
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,950
These women

666
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,640
were mostly sent to the manors

667
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,680
of high officials and generals,

668
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,720
as bribes of wining their support.

669
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:26,325
A few days ago,

670
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,360
these were clearly written

671
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,400
on the accounting books

672
00:27:28,425 --> 00:27:29,450
that were found in the rebel prince manor.

673
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,720
Can they still deny it?

674
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,880
This is nonsense.

675
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,160
You are obviously

676
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,400
spouting nonsense!

677
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,200
Impossible.

678
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,100
That's right,

679
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,625
it's impossible.

680
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,360
This crime of rebellion

681
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,840
even Prince Huan won't be able to help us.

682
00:27:47,975 --> 00:27:49,100
But don't worry.

683
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,400
The crime that

684
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,640
they committed is not very grave.

685
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,880
They will only receive some punishments,

686
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:55,400
won't kill them.

687
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,200
Won't kill them?

688
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,920
Ye'er,

689
00:28:02,535 --> 00:28:04,760
they are your biological siblings.

690
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,320
Can't you help

691
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,440
and pull them out from there?

692
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,320
If this criminal charge is implemented,

693
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,200
perhaps,

694
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,720
we may not be able to protect

695
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,275
the title of Gu family.

696
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,480
How will it benefit you

697
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,840
if the Gu family collapse?

698
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,160
You are also a grandson of the Gu family.

699
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,750
Right...

700
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,280
Grandson of the Gu family?

701
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,875
That year,

702
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,000
you and Big Madam were evil and slandered me.

703
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,480
You refused to let me

704
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,880
see my father for the last time.

705
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,800
Did you regard me

706
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,840
as the grandson of the Gu family?

707
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,360
When I was homeless and in desperate

708
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,880
plight out there,

709
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,760
did you regard me

710
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,000
as the grandson of the Gu family?

711
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,560
You now regard me

712
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,920
as the grandson of the Gu family!

713
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:45,760
About this...alright.

714
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,075
We're talking about the matter

715
00:28:47,075 --> 00:28:47,760
of Tingbing and Tingdi,

716
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:48,900
so why must you include

717
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,700
those other messed up things?

718
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,400
I...I think you don't want to be involved.

719
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,825
Fine. These two evil creatures

720
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,745
should suffer

721
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,550
for their evil acts.

722
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,600
We won't plead for mercy from you.

723
00:28:56,625 --> 00:28:57,325
You!

724
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:00,200
He didn't plan to be involved in the first place.

725
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,550
Fourth Uncle, Fifth Uncle, I'm leaving.

726
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,200
No need to see me off.

727
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,240
Ye'er! Ye'er!

728
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,040
Why you said something like that?

729
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,550
You don't want your son to live?!

730
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,160
He didn't plan to get involved in the first place.

731
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,975
What's the use of pleading to him?

732
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,960
You don't want anyone to be involved?!

733
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,360
It's late. Go to sleep first.

734
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,600
Read this tomorrow.

735
00:29:47,575 --> 00:29:48,425
We are getting critically close to

736
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,280
the investigation of the rebellion party.

737
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,240
If we don't quickly settle

738
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,240
the name list of those involved,

739
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,000
I'm afraid if it's takes too long,

740
00:29:55,575 --> 00:29:56,900
someone will get wid of it and escape.

741
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,680
I will instruct the kitchen

742
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,000
to cut some fruits and bring them here.

743
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:02,880
No need.

744
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,575
I have never eaten anything in the night.

745
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,000
Go to sleep now.

746
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,280
Ever since you have been investigating

747
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,320
the rebellion party,

748
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,480
you didn't sleep in our room

749
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,600
for a whole month.

750
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,760
You always

751
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,240
sleep in the study room.

752
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:37,640
Look at you.

753
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,720
Those who serves me in the study,

754
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,200
not a single of them are women.

755
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,960
I'm not being suspicious of you. It's just that...

756
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,320
Don't worry.

757
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:54,000
We are already a married couple,

758
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,075
I won't disappoint you.

759
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:27,400
Miss.

760
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,800
Don't be angry.

761
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,000
I asked around in the manor.

762
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,840
All the people in this manor

763
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,440
are full of praises to your husband.

764
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,960
They all say that he is clean-living and honest,

765
00:31:38,175 --> 00:31:39,550
never a womanizer.

766
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,025
It may be so

767
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,920
but I keep feeling

768
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,520
that he's too formal with me.

769
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,280
Isn't that good?

770
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,800
Everyone say that lifting the tray

771
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,425
to the eyebrow level

772
00:31:49,425 --> 00:31:50,680
and treating each other like special guests

773
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,120
are what makes a married couple last.

774
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,760
You don't understand.

775
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,600
He treats me like an outsider.

776
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,025
He might look so considerate and thorough

777
00:32:02,025 --> 00:32:02,520
in caring for me,

778
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,320
but in reality, he doesn't tell me anything.

779
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,320
When he has any problems,

780
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,000
he keeps them in his heart,

781
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:10,200
and pretends that it's nothing.

782
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,400
I'd rather that he shouts at me,

783
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,920
throw a fit on me.

784
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:18,560
By the way, talking about this,

785
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,520
I heard this from a Nanny.

786
00:32:22,525 --> 00:32:23,600
She said that

787
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,375
before Master married

788
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:26,600
that princess of the third rank,

789
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,920
his had a crush of a daughter

790
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,840
of a junior official.

791
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,240
There's something like this?

792
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,320
What happened after that?

793
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:40,125
Then,

794
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,120
he was forced into marriage by Prince Yong.

795
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,360
This matter was left unsettled.

796
00:32:48,825 --> 00:32:50,575
What's the name

797
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,400
of the daughter of that junior official?

798
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,880
I heard her family name is Sheng.

799
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:57,760
I'm not clear about her name,

800
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,960
only know she ranked

801
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,240
the sixth in her family.

802
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,080
Ask around and check

803
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,720
what's so special

804
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,520
about this Miss Sheng.

805
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,600
About this...

806
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,160
It's not a good idea.

807
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,325
If Guye find out

808
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,200
we will be so embarrassed.

809
00:33:19,725 --> 00:33:20,900
I know it's not a good idea

810
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,925
but I can't get through the hurdle

811
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,075
in my heart.

812
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:25,920
I want to know

813
00:33:26,175 --> 00:33:26,925
if he has someone else

814
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,875
in his heart.

815
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,880
If that's the reason he don't want to open his heart to me.

816
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,680
Aunties and sister-in-laws, be at ease.

817
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,040
My husband already said

818
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,720
that it's not same grave crime.

819
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,360
You make it sound so easy.

820
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:38,700
Whenever people enters

821
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,320
that prison of the Ministry of Justice,

822
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,880
he surely will get skinned.

823
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,400
What should we do?

824
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,720
Fourth Auntie, don't get agitated.

825
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,680
I'm sure that the Ministry of Prison

826
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,400
will take my husband in consideration

827
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,360
and won't harm my older brothers-in-law.

828
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:52,480
Who said that they won't?

829
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,080
On the day they were arrested,

830
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,800
they were taken tied up.

831
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,680
Who cared about our relation with Gu Tingye?

832
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,080
Moreover,

833
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,480
everyone in our family are already panicking

834
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,225
to the point of suffocating themselves

835
00:34:00,225 --> 00:34:00,720
and you're still so calm.

836
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,760
And so appeased.

837
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:04,185
Don't know

838
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,640
what your heart is made of.

839
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,825
Since this is an external household matter,

840
00:34:08,825 --> 00:34:09,280
as a wife,

841
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,500
I also can't intervene.

842
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,800
If my husband

843
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,760
has other worries or considerations to make,

844
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,760
shall I force him?

845
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,280
Maybe second sister-in-law has such courage.

846
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,120
But I just got married here not long ago

847
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,440
and I don't have any children.

848
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,200
I can only be cautious and stay within my bounds.

849
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,920
I dare not step into the lightning pond by a step.

850
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:27,250
Hope sister-in-law can understand.

851
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,280
How do you speak?

852
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,640
You're so unruly.

853
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,920
Minglan, we are one family.

854
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:37,600
If there are any words,

855
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,975
let's sit down and slowly say them.

856
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,025
Come.

857
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,160
Come. Come. Sit down and let's slowly talk.

858
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:45,440
I'm just too anxious.

859
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,920
What should we do?

860
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:50,000
Minglan,

861
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,825
although your words were indeed right,

862
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,160
you should still go back

863
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,360
and urge Ye'er.

864
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,680
The Gu family is one body.

865
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,875
The success or destruction of one

866
00:34:58,875 --> 00:34:59,920
will affect everyone.

867
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:01,600
If any clan members gets sentenced,

868
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,040
this won't be

869
00:35:05,075 --> 00:35:06,555
be a good thing for him either.

870
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,480
That's right.

871
00:35:07,575 --> 00:35:09,475
I've told him all that.

872
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,395
But you all surely know

873
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,680
his temper

874
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,760
better than I do.

875
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,160
Once he has decided,

876
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,550
nobody can make him change his mind.

877
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:20,760
If he doesn't want to say something,

878
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:21,880
nobody can

879
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,320
let him say a word.

880
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,080
If I get firm and force him,

881
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,800
what if he want divorces with with me?

882
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,760
Will Fourth Auntie and Fifth Auntie take me

883
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,360
in for the rest of my life?

884
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,480
But you said earlier that

885
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,160
Ye'er must have some other

886
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,640
worries or considerations.

887
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,880
You could at least clearly ask him about

888
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,120
those when you go back, right?

889
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:45,650
At least,

890
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,880
let our sons die informed.

891
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,350
Right. We are not begging you

892
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,080
to go put in some kind words.

893
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,250
Just go ask Ye'er

894
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,040
what he really wants.

895
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,280
This...

896
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,560
I'm just afraid that even if I ask,

897
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,040
he won't say it.

898
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:03,900
No,

899
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,080
can't you ask him obliquely?

900
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,200
Who told you to ask him straight out?

901
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,440
We have a problem! Big Madam!

902
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:10,720
Big Madam!

903
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,975
Rong'er is missing!

904
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,325
What?

905
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,160
Isn't she in my room?

906
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,050
I also don't know the full details.

907
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,160
Nanny Chang said that

908
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,110
she was supposed to do her hair.

909
00:36:19,125 --> 00:36:19,920
When she left to look for a hair tie,

910
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,000
Miss Rong was gone when she returned.

911
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:23,140
Then, quickly search the garden!

912
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,040
They have already did.

913
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,360
They said that

914
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,425
they have searched the whole garden,

915
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,640
What should we do, Big Madam?

916
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,840
Then... what should I do?

917
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,960
Let's go. Let's go. I'll personally look for her.

918
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:35,680
There's always trouble.

919
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,600
Everyone is not making me feel at ease!

920
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,760
You're just leaving like that?!

921
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:45,920
You're just going to let us dry out here ,

922
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,600
is that it?

923
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,720
You're not going to help us anymore?

924
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,080
Servants!

925
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,000
Everyone has left?

926
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,350
You wish.

927
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,240
They would probably be here until nightfall.

928
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,360
After sitting for 4 to 6 hours,

929
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,440
they'll get bored and will naturally leave.

930
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,600
This trick of yours is so clever.

931
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:16,300
Who cares how important their matter is?

932
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:16,760
Once a child is lost,

933
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,600
you must go look for her.

934
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:20,300
It's just right

935
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,480
for you to leave them behind.

936
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,640
No one will criticize you.

937
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:27,325
Just to make it look real,

938
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,920
I really went to the garden and searched

939
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,680
for a while.

940
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,280
I had to take a long way back to the study room.

941
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,200
I'm so tired.

942
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,080
I initially thought that

943
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,150
you won't be able to handle those shrews.

944
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,275
From the looks of it now,

945
00:37:44,275 --> 00:37:45,750
I was over worrying for nothing.

946
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,520
You totally can graduate now.

947
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,800
That's right too.

948
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,560
In my maiden house,

949
00:37:55,525 --> 00:37:56,850
I only knew to pretend to be dumb.

950
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,040
Since I marry you,

951
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,425
I even learned to act shamelessly.

952
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,320
I really be more and more like you.

953
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,320
I'll treat that as a praise.

954
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,360
But you must be careful.

955
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,440
These Gu people

956
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,440
aren't that easy to deal with.

957
00:38:20,725 --> 00:38:22,025
You may have escaped them for today,

958
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:22,850
but they will return and

959
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:23,425
intensify their attacks on you.

960
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,475
You must really be careful.

961
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,960
They will make your life a hell.

962
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,440
Are you afraid of them causing trouble?

963
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,640
Of course, I'm not.

964
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,680
If you're not, then I'm not too.

965
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:44,440
On the day that you married Yuanruo,

966
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,880
something just coincidentally came up at home,

967
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,720
hence, I wasn't able to attend your wedding.

968
00:38:49,225 --> 00:38:49,950
Today,

969
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,480
I'm making up for my gift.

970
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:55,450
You can't do this.

971
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,400
The different elders from the Gu Family

972
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,880
have already given us a lot of gifts.

973
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,725
No,

974
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,440
those were gifts from the whole Gu Family.

975
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,520
This...

976
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,480
is my private gift.

977
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,680
Just take it.

978
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,120
It's just a beaded necklace.

979
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,800
You can wear it for fun.

980
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:18,720
Big Madam, you're my grandaunt.

981
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,000
Just be frank with me.

982
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,120
Although I'm a woman,

983
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,175
I did hear a few news.

984
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,875
My husband is in charge of

985
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,115
the purging of the rebel faction.

986
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:36,600
The Gu family has been implicated.

987
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,280
If I accept your gift,

988
00:39:40,975 --> 00:39:41,950
those who knows will say that

989
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,240
it's just an elder doting on her young descendant.

990
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,425
But those who don't know will say

991
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,160
Gu House is bribing the wife of an official.

992
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,920
My husband will

993
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,280
also not look good.

994
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,640
Never thought that

995
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,880
you're a person that can see things so thoroughly.

996
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,200
Fine. I'll be frank then.

997
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,280
I'm shamelessly begging

998
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,750
a young generation

999
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,680
for I was left with no choice.

1000
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:13,840
If I directly

1001
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,360
ask Yuanruo

1002
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,800
and he refuses me,

1003
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,920
there won't be any room to redeem my cause.

1004
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,480
hence,

1005
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,960
I'm begging you instead.

1006
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,400
This...

1007
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,800
This is a government matter, hence,

1008
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,500
I don't know much.

1009
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,760
My husband never

1010
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,160
tells me about these.

1011
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,040
I'm afraid that I can't help.

1012
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,960
No. No.

1013
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:41,120
I'm not asking you

1014
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,880
to beg for leniency

1015
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,360
from Yuanruo on my behalf.

1016
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,760
I just ask that if you

1017
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,520
can put some nice words

1018
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,680
about those vile spawns

1019
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,560
on behalf of our family.

1020
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,800
Let those people in prison

1021
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:00,800
not make things too difficult for them.

1022
00:41:02,275 --> 00:41:03,600
My husband

1023
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,000
is only in charge of

1024
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,040
the interrogation and lawsuit.

1025
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:09,240
He never get involves with the prison tortures.

1026
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:12,080
In my opinion,

1027
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:14,675
that if you just want the prison people

1028
00:41:14,675 --> 00:41:15,360
to take care of them,

1029
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,120
it's better to just ask General Gu.

1030
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,400
That will be more convenient.

1031
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:20,475
He's closer with the people of

1032
00:41:20,475 --> 00:41:21,520
the local court and prison.

1033
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,720
If I'm able to do that,

1034
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,425
You think

1035
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,040
I would shamelessly come here today to ask you?

1036
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,000
Don't you know?

1037
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,625
This gossip was known

1038
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:38,720
all over the capital back then.

1039
00:41:39,675 --> 00:41:40,900
They said my husband that

1040
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,880
and your Madam Sheng

1041
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,720
have a past affair.

1042
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,160
Because of that,

1043
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,320
how could my husband

1044
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,400
still make any connection

1045
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,240
with your Gu Family?

1046
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:53,720
He would rather avoid your family.

1047
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,960
I didn't grow up in Bianjing,

1048
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,950
so I ask around.

1049
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,600
My husband

1050
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,280
and your Madam Sheng

1051
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,000
just studied together

1052
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,960
through a private tutor

1053
00:42:07,975 --> 00:42:09,350
when they were younger.

1054
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,240
Yet, they got gossiped like that.

1055
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,600
It shows how'm afraidful gossip can be.

1056
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,560
That's right. You are right.

1057
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,240
You are a sensible person.

1058
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,900
I heard that

1059
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,800
that person who really had a past

1060
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,680
romantic relationship with Madam Sheng

1061
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:30,900
is the He Family of

1062
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,840
the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

1063
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,250
I heard that they were about

1064
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:36,000
to give betrothal gifts,

1065
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,680
but for some reason, they change their minds,

1066
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,720
and she got married into your family instead.

1067
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,680
That illegitimate daughter

1068
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,150
is really something.

1069
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,520
Bianjing is really a lair

1070
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,000
of hiding dragons and tigers.

1071
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:53,920
That's right.

1072
00:42:55,275 --> 00:42:55,950
Right.

1073
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,040
How come,

1074
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,520
as a member of the Gu family,

1075
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,175
she instead was happier

1076
00:43:08,175 --> 00:43:09,120
after hearing scandals about their family?

1077
00:43:10,625 --> 00:43:12,025
Won't you be happy

1078
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,150
if you're able to obtain

1079
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:13,760
the weakness of other people?

1080
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,560
Say, that Madam Sheng can be said

1081
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,880
to be a well-known figure.

1082
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:18,720
She even played polo

1083
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,920
together with Young Master.

1084
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,200
Even Miss doesn't know

1085
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,240
that Young Master can play polo.

1086
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:24,750
That time,

1087
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,800
we haven't entered the capital.

1088
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,520
Also,

1089
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,240
I heard that the personal servant

1090
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,680
of Young Master now was just a replacement.

1091
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,575
That original servant named Buwei

1092
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,125
grew up with Young Master

1093
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,050
and is very caring.

1094
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,360
But because

1095
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,800
he set up a meeting

1096
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:40,600
between Young Master and Madam Sheng,

1097
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:41,480
he got caned to death

1098
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,800
by Princess.

1099
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,000
A seductress like that

1100
00:43:45,275 --> 00:43:46,440
is really scared.

1101
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,280
Shut up!

1102
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,000
Don't mention

1103
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,760
that woman again.

1104
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,375
If this gets out,

1105
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,640
the reputation of the Qi family will be tarnished.
