The Story of Minglan

2
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,959
Episode 1

3
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,519
It's 6 o'clock, a new day has arrived.

4
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:13,440
The snow hasn't melted so dress warmly.

5
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:22,680
It's 6 o'clock, a new day has arrived.

6
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,040
The snow hasn't melted so dress warmly.

7
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:45,800
I told you to go get some charcoal.

8
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,000
What took you so long?

9
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:48,400
If the Mistress and her kids wake up…

10
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,360
What's wrong? Who bullied you?

11
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,879
The kitchen didn't give me the charcoal

12
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,599
and kicked me out.

13
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,800
Did you tell them

14
00:01:56,839 --> 00:01:57,919
this was our allotment?

15
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,080
I did.

16
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:01,720
But Ms Guan just told me to get lost.

17
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,839
I'm going to see them

18
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,160
Give me the basket

19
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,039
Go inside. It's cold out here.

20
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:14,279
Don't pull me.

21
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,440
It's our Mistress'

22
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,559
allotment.

23
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,520
Who let you in?

24
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,279
Get out now.

25
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,199
It's such a fine day.

26
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,080
Why are you making a mess here?

27
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:20,600
Don't pull me.

28
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,639
What are you doing?

29
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:28,559
Greetings to Miss Zhou.

30
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,279
What brings you here in person?

31
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:33,320
Leave!

32
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,759
Don't irritate Miss Zhou.

33
00:02:36,119 --> 00:02:37,199
You are afraid now.

34
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:38,960
You weren't afraid

35
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,720
when you embezzled the provisions.

36
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,000
You weren't afraid

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,160
when you embezzled the charcoal.

38
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,839
The rule is 4 kilos of charcoal per day

39
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,160
but now we only get 2 kilos every other three to five days.

40
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,279
Since Miss Zhou now is helping

41
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:50,520
Mistress Lin to manage this house now,

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,399
let Miss Zhou be the judge of this then.

43
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,520
How dare you!

44
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,880
Mistress Wei is pregnant now.

45
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,080
You thieves!

46
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,520
You even dare to embezzle her items.

47
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,600
We didn't.

48
00:03:07,559 --> 00:03:08,679
They have got more than necessary

49
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,320
over the past few days.

50
00:03:10,679 --> 00:03:11,960
The kitchen servant who did the dispensing

51
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,720
is young and

52
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:13,800
dares not to say anything.

53
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,440
She let them take it away.

54
00:03:15,679 --> 00:03:17,360
The kitchen accounts didn't tally yesterday.

55
00:03:17,559 --> 00:03:18,440
We personally

56
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,759
made up for it.

57
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,479
I supposed Miss Xiaodie

58
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,679
would not admit this.

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,880
So we started deducting

60
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,320
from her allotment.

61
00:03:26,679 --> 00:03:27,880
Miss Xiaodie,

62
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,479
please take pity on us.

63
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,479
Our pay is low.

64
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,399
Now the one managing dispensing

65
00:03:33,399 --> 00:03:34,880
can afford nothing.

66
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:36,160
Nonsense.

67
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:37,800
Since you claim there is an account,

68
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,000
take it out and show us.

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,320
See if we stamped our fingerprints

70
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,559
for the receipt.

71
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,039
Miss Xiaodie,

72
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,919
Do you really need to be so angry?

73
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,279
If you had taken more before,

74
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:50,119
just take less for today.

75
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,639
Once the account tallies,

76
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,559
you will get

77
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:54,199
your allotment as normal standard.

78
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:59,679
Fine. Since Miss Zhou can't handle this satisfactorily,

79
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,800
I can only go to

80
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,880
Seek the Madam and

81
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,119
let her decide which side is right.

82
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:04,119
We'll see just how much charcoal

83
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,360
my Mistress should get.

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,479
Today is the day for engagement ceremony.

85
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,639
Madam has plenty of things to do

86
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,279
and doesn't have time for your brashness.

87
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,360
Since we have grievance,

88
00:04:13,399 --> 00:04:14,800
We will knock the drum by the palace of His Highness

89
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,479
If necessary.

90
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:18,480
Even if I get flogged and dragged out today,

91
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,720
I will redress my Mistress's grievance!

92
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,320
You are not allowed to go. Come back here.

93
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:21,880
What are you doing?

94
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,119
You are not allowed to go. Move aside.

95
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,040
What are you doing?

96
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,160
Are you trying to kill me?

97
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:26,959
Even if I'm not successful today,

98
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:27,920
I will still report this tomorrow.

99
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,480
It's only just a little charcoal.

100
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,519
Do you need to do this?

101
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,119
Miss Guan.

102
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,079
Yes.

103
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:37,119
Since Miss Xiaodie wants charcoal,

104
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,000
just go to the kitchen

105
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,399
and get her some.

106
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:41,239
Yes.

107
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,640
I will go and fetch her

108
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,600
a lot from the kitchen,

109
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:45,600
so today's banquet won't be delayed.

110
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,279
Why do you bother?

111
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:53,679
Miss Xiaodie, don't be angry.

112
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:05,200
There are 10 to 15 kilos here.

113
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
It should be enough anyway.

114
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,239
Whatever belongs to me, I will take them all.

115
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,480
Whatever doesn't,

116
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:35,720
I won't take a squat.

117
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,640
That courtyard.

118
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,239
Because their mistress is pregnant,

119
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,399
they get so arrogant like this.

120
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,279
They will suffer in the future.

121
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,320
Only we don't want to disturb the Madam.

122
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,959
Cancel the engagement.

123
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:13,720
I don't want the betrothal gifts!

124
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:16,480
The House of Yuan is playing this trick now.

125
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:18,320
Why bother to make the betrothal ship come ashore?

126
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,720
He should just turn the boat around and go back

127
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,839
to tell his father at home that

128
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:22,040
the daughter of our House

129
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,559
doesn't care about their Count Manor!

130
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,559
This is such a great match.

131
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,279
What nonsense are you spouting?

132
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:37,119
Nonsense?

133
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,920
If the one getting engaged today

134
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,079
isn't my Hua'er,

135
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:44,200
if it's Molan who's getting this neglect,

136
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:46,200
guess if that Mistress Lin,

137
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,640
your beloved Lin Qinshuang,

138
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,720
will spout nonsense or not?

139
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,600
We're having a discussion about Hua'er's marriage.

140
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,559
Why did you bring her up?

141
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,239
You don't care about Hua'er.

142
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,200
This is the marriage you arranged for her.

143
00:06:58,119 --> 00:06:59,959
It was agreed that the Count and the Countess

144
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,160
would come to propose the marriage here in Yangzhou.

145
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,880
Now they only sent their eldest son

146
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,559
Yuan Wenchun to deal with us.

147
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,160
You made me buy into it by

148
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,239
making it sounds like in a fairy tale.

149
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:09,720
You said there was great chaos over the appointment

150
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,239
of a royal heir in the capital these days,

151
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:12,079
so we had better

152
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,519
not mix with those involved.

153
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,760
And the loyal noble House of Yuan

154
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,119
once experienced neglect,

155
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,000
so their offsprings are more sensible

156
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,920
and diligent than others.

157
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:22,640
And you saw that boy

158
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,760
Yuan Wenshao personally,

159
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,399
and bragged about how mature, cordial

160
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,559
and majestic he was.

161
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,399
Yes, the Yuan's House

162
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:30,119
is so majestic indeed!

163
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,359
Let me tell you.

164
00:07:32,359 --> 00:07:33,880
Hua'er is my first-born daughter.

165
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,320
No one is allowed to mistreat her!

166
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:42,279
Stop pinning that in my hair!

167
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,160
Wife.

168
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,359
Wife.

169
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,600
After hearing what you said,

170
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,399
I feel very hurt.

171
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,359
How can I not care about Hua'er?

172
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,839
Back when I was posted to Lingzhou,

173
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:19,880
that bitterly cold place,

174
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,160
the entire household

175
00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:24,839
was all managed by you alone.

176
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,519
Hua'er was born

177
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,600
at that time.

178
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,760
From her childhood,

179
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,399
she has grown up with more hardship than other younger ones.

180
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,239
But despite that,

181
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:34,440
she's the most sensible

182
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,760
and obedient one.

183
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,679
And also the most endearing.

184
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,520
I selected the House of Yuan,

185
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,039
because I saw clearly

186
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,000
Yuan Wenshao was a good boy.

187
00:08:48,359 --> 00:08:49,880
I just want Hua'er

188
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,719
to marry a decent

189
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:52,719
and responsible man.

190
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,400
They can get along as harmoniously as possible

191
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,960
and raise their children

192
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,000
in a smooth life.

193
00:09:01,359 --> 00:09:02,119
Right?

194
00:09:06,119 --> 00:09:06,760
Give me that.

195
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,679
Let me pin it for my wife.

196
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,760
You thought I didn't know they

197
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,080
had not fulfilled their agreement?

198
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,799
But the boat with the gifts

199
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,159
has already arrived at the pier.

200
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,039
The betrothal gifts have already been unloaded.

201
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,000
They have been unloaded?

202
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,320
Don't move.

203
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,799
Who permitted that?

204
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,320
I told Brother Bai to welcome the boat.

205
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,159
Without my permission, he wouldn't allow it.

206
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,280
I think there's already a huge crowd

207
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,359
on the dock.

208
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,039
All the officials and their families of Yangzhou

209
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:39,679
are all in your courtyard.

210
00:09:39,719 --> 00:09:41,239
Should we tell the House of Yuans to leave now?

211
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,320
If the Yuans bully my Hua'er…

212
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,520
No matter how bad the Yuans are,

213
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,280
they are protected under a noble title.

214
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,840
Even if their careers don't go smoothly in the future,

215
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:55,919
at least they have the noble title

216
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:56,799
to lean back on.

217
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,359
If that boy

218
00:09:59,359 --> 00:10:01,320
Yuan Wenshao turns out to be a success,

219
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:04,119
there will be a luxurious and noble life

220
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,159
waiting for Hua'er in the future.

221
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,239
I don't care whether there will be

222
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,280
wealth and nobility or not.

223
00:10:09,479 --> 00:10:10,880
If he bullies my Hua'er,

224
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,359
I will fight against him with my life.

225
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,640
Not only you,

226
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,280
I will be the first

227
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,320
to butt heads with his family!

228
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,799
What are you waiting for?

229
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:21,280
Dress the Madam.

230
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,760
Hurry up.

231
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,840
I'm going out to take a look.

232
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,400
Go to the pier and tell Brother Bai

233
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,200
that he can unload

234
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,719
the betrothal gifts now.

235
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:44,679
Yes.

236
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,799
Wait.

237
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:47,479
I haven't finished talking yet.

238
00:10:48,599 --> 00:10:49,679
Tell the Yuans

239
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:51,520
to pay extra attention to their courtesies

240
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,280
when they're announcing their arrival.

241
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,280
Yes.

242
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,679
Why is there so much smoke

243
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:30,479
when the charcoal isn't even wet?

244
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:31,960
It's charcoal from the hearth.

245
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,599
They dared to deceive me!

246
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:35,039
The stove charcoal makes so much smoke,

247
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,119
so how can it be used for room warming?

248
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:37,280
I'll go back to them now

249
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,080
to get gray charcoal.

250
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:39,960
Xiaodie, don't go.

251
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,080
If the weather's cold, just wear more clothes.

252
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,440
If not,

253
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,880
seal the windows tighter.

254
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,280
Mistress,

255
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,400
we can't make without even

256
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,200
one fire in the room.

257
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:51,960
Moreover,

258
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,239
this should be your allotment in the first place.

259
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,200
What do you mean by that?

260
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,280
If they give it to you, it's your allotment.

261
00:11:58,119 --> 00:12:00,080
If they don't , it's not your allotment.

262
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:02,880
Don't mention this again in the future.

263
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,080
Use the charcoal left to boil some hot water.

264
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,039
We'll fill up the foot warmers at night.

265
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,640
You can put one more in your bed.

266
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:13,159
I'm not cold.

267
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,000
It's just that Xiaotao and Sixth Miss

268
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,559
are still young,

269
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,799
they'll feel cold.

270
00:12:19,599 --> 00:12:20,359
Come with me for a while.

271
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,080
Xiaodie.

272
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,520
No way!

273
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,400
This is your dowry.

274
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,840
The rest are all pawned off

275
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,799
and this is the only one left.

276
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,039
But look at how cold the children are now.

277
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,719
Never mind if it's my dowry.

278
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:52,719
Pawn it for me.

279
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:54,119
I can't! I can't pawn it.

280
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:55,200
It's granny's bracelet.

281
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,359
We don't have any charcoal, right?

282
00:12:58,359 --> 00:12:59,359
Just tell father.

283
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:01,080
He will scold the kitchen

284
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,559
and have them issue our allotment.

285
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,200
If you don't want it sold,

286
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,000
tomorrow

287
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,719
go to serve Old Madam.

288
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:15,960
No, Mother, I won't leave you!

289
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,080
If I leave, who will take care of you!

290
00:13:20,359 --> 00:13:22,119
I'm already an adult.

291
00:13:22,119 --> 00:13:23,799
I don't need you to take care of me.

292
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:26,000
This is your father

293
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,359
giving you some extra care.

294
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,320
If you can win Old Madam's favor

295
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,479
and get to be raised by her,

296
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:36,080
I hear they only use silver charcoal there

297
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,640
and it's so warm in the room.

298
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,400
I'm not afraid of cold.

299
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,440
It's hot!

300
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:44,159
If you don't want to listen to me,

301
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,359
then don't mention the charcoal again,

302
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,840
and give the bracelet to Xiaodie.

303
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:55,760
Give it to her.

304
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,119
Sister Xiaodie.

305
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:14,840
What's up?

306
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,000
That's my mother's

307
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:18,719
only dowry left.

308
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,440
I don't want to sell it either,

309
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:22,359
but if we don't sell it,

310
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:23,719
where will we get charcoal for her?

311
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,599
I don't want any charcoal.

312
00:14:25,599 --> 00:14:26,799
That's the only one left.

313
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,719
How about we take the stove charcoal we have

314
00:14:34,719 --> 00:14:36,119
and sell it,

315
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:37,799
then buy some gray charcoal?

316
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,119
Even if it's only half a kilo,

317
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:41,880
it can still keep us warm for a while.

318
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,479
Miss, you are smart.

319
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:47,599
Let's do this then.

320
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:49,119
Minglan, hurry back

321
00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:50,760
and get dressed!

322
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,479
The boat with the betrothal gifts

323
00:14:51,479 --> 00:14:52,239
for your sister will be here soon!

324
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:05,919
The Loyal and Diligent Count of Dongjing, House of Yuans,

325
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:07,640
presents a request for marriage.

326
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,640
The Loyal and Diligent Count of Dongjing, House of Yuans,

327
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,320
presents a request for marriage!

328
00:16:12,719 --> 00:16:13,919
With a pair of live wild geese

329
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:15,479
from beyond the Great Wall as the main gift

330
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:16,919
and countless secondary gifts,

331
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:18,960
We want to propose for the second son

332
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,719
of House of Yuans to a noble lady of your House,

333
00:16:20,719 --> 00:16:22,719
We await your approval!

334
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,159
Approved.

335
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,440
Approved.

336
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:38,919
Approved.

337
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:44,559
Congratulations to the House of Yuans .

338
00:16:44,599 --> 00:16:45,960
Bless of eternal years.

339
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:48,200
The second son of your noble House, Yuan Wenshao,

340
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:50,960
proposes to the eldest daughter of the Madam,

341
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,520
Sheng Hualan.

342
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,080
The approval has been given.

343
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,520
Approved!

344
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:58,200
My wife and I, on behalf of our elders,

345
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,679
present our gratitude for your approval.

346
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,959
Two points!

347
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,800
Congratulations.

348
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,199
Not bad, your daughter will marry into a good family.

349
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,560
Magistrate, you have really made a good marriage arrangement!

350
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,839
The House of the Loyal and Diligent Count

351
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,640
is so prestigious.

352
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,800
Ah! It's been a long time…

353
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:49,599
Ladies,

354
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,560
forgive our simple and crude hospitality.

355
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,079
No, it's great.

356
00:17:58,079 --> 00:17:59,040
Everyone, enjoy yourselves.

357
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,040
You're so cordial.

358
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,160
Come and sit.

359
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,839
Alright.

360
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:05,760
Well,

361
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,479
your temperament is most amiable,

362
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,239
and you're tough and considerate too.

363
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:13,239
I won't have to worry about you.

364
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,719
Yet your dowry is the ballast stone.

365
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:19,520
It's better to have more.

366
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:21,479
Madam,

367
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:22,959
twenty years ago,

368
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:24,760
I was your sister's relative, the next-door neighbor

369
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,800
on Shigu Lane back then.

370
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,160
Do you remember me?

371
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,880
Come, let me give you a toast.

372
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,680
Come.

373
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,800
Madam, big trouble.

374
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:41,239
Third Brother is playing pot-pitching with the guests

375
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:43,199
and he's about to lose all the betrothal gifts.

376
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,359
That little bastard!

377
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:06,239
We're in trouble, Elder Sister.

378
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:07,439
Third Brother is gambling with your wild geese in the engagement gifts

379
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,520
and he's about to lose.

380
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,160
How could this happen?

381
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:13,199
I don't how that happened.

382
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:18,000
Grandmother, what should we do now?

383
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,839
How many points did Changfeng score?

384
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,280
Only one.

385
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:25,119
Then we can't just halt it

386
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:26,560
when others are winning continually.

387
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,439
Why can't we stop them?

388
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,280
He agreed to play the pot-pitching

389
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,760
and if he quits when he is about to lose it,

390
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:33,959
After that,

391
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:36,640
our family's face will be all lost.

392
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,640
What should we do about this?

393
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,599
I will

394
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:47,560
listen to your arrangement.

395
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,599
Today,

396
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:50,239
you are still the eldest girl of this family.

397
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,719
Tomorrow,

398
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:53,560
you will be the Second Madam of the Yuans.

399
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,520
You don't know how often you will meet

400
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,920
these incidents in the future.

401
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:00,479
You can't just handle it with my advice again.

402
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,439
From this moment onwards,

403
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:05,640
you make the decisions.

404
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,640
I…

405
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:12,040
I need to make my own decisions?

406
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:28,319
If this continues,

407
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:29,439
You are about to lose.

408
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:42,280
Great!

409
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,839
Good. Always a nice shot.

410
00:20:57,599 --> 00:20:58,319
Where's my husband?

411
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,000
We've searched around here

412
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,160
but didn't find him.

413
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,839
Though it's children's game,

414
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,119
the wild geese are still a betrothal gift

415
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,439
your family just brought over.

416
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,119
If my son loses it,

417
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:12,199
it's not just our family that will be humiliated.

418
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:13,119
Your family

419
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:14,439
will be embarrassed too.

420
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,160
It is indeed humiliating.

421
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:18,479
You should go

422
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,760
and stop it immediately.

423
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:20,880
What?

424
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,520
You brought that boy here.

425
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,719
Shouldn't you be the one

426
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:27,959
to go to stop it?

427
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:31,000
That Brother Ye is a famous character

428
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,079
in Dongjing.

429
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,439
He saw that

430
00:21:33,439 --> 00:21:34,520
Yangzhou's pot-pitching game

431
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,479
is different from that of Dongjing,

432
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,760
so he was enticed to play.

433
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,119
Now, I can't dissuade him.

434
00:21:41,439 --> 00:21:42,680
Great.

435
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,680
He must be with that whore in

436
00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:46,040
Mistress Lin Qinshuang's courtyard.

437
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:47,959
That's not so sure though.

438
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,239
On an occasion like this,

439
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,239
he must be socializing with the guests.

440
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,160
Still, that betrothal geese is about to be lost

441
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,400
and he's still not here!

442
00:21:57,199 --> 00:21:58,359
He must be in that bitch's courtyard!

443
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,760
Faster.

444
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,400
Higher.

445
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,119
I told Big Brother not to play it

446
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:12,319
because he'll lose for sure,

447
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,199
but he insisted on humiliating himself.

448
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,520
Mother.

449
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,119
I don't want to go to the banquet.

450
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,800
It's too embarrassing!

451
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:21,199
Alright.

452
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,239
Don't go then.

453
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,400
Why are you crying?

454
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,000
Yunzai,

455
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,359
accompany the Miss

456
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:30,199
to go and play in the garden.

457
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:30,920
Go now.

458
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,479
Yes.

459
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,599
Let's go, Miss.

460
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,040
Go.

461
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:39,599
That loser.

462
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:48,760
Look here.

463
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:51,040
We are the host and he's a guest,

464
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:52,199
so it's not convenient.

465
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:54,959
He's someone you brought here after all.

466
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:57,280
So you go there and whatever you say,

467
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:59,000
it's more convenient.

468
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,599
But, Uncle, you should know that

469
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:04,400
though the betrothal geese were hunted by my brother,

470
00:23:05,239 --> 00:23:07,400
they have already belonged to your House

471
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,719
and have been displayed as your property.

472
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,479
So they are your geese.

473
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,560
I'm an outsider.

474
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,280
I think it's best you go there . . .

475
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,920
Young man,

476
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,119
your family gifted the geese to us.

477
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,599
now a man you brought here

478
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:28,119
Is going to to win it back.

479
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,439
Are you trying to humiliate

480
00:23:30,479 --> 00:23:32,040
our family on purpose?

481
00:23:33,719 --> 00:23:35,040
Oh, I have no such intention at all.

482
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,920
But then

483
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,280
that's all due to Changfeng

484
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,719
wanting to bring attention to himself.

485
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,520
If I interfere,

486
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,359
It will not be appropriate at all.

487
00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:49,560
Since that's the case,

488
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,160
never mind my chattering.

489
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,839
You are startling me

490
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:57,199
with those words of yours.

491
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,160
Damn it!

492
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,319
He got drunk and couldn't control himself,

493
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,680
and got himself used by others.

494
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,959
The Madam is here.

495
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:14,959
Madam . . .

496
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,119
Have I failed to fulfill my hospitality

497
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:20,160
to offend you?

498
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,439
Please calm down.

499
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,439
Why are you pretending?

500
00:24:25,439 --> 00:24:26,800
Your son is losing

501
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:27,479
my Hua'lan's betrothal geese,

502
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:28,280
but you…

503
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,359
You just sit here arranging flowers and tasting tea

504
00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:32,280
while keeping my husband here!

505
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:33,880
Go call him out.

506
00:24:34,199 --> 00:24:34,800
Yes.

507
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:38,359
Madam.

508
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:40,319
Did Changfeng really commit such a deed?

509
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:43,959
But as for the betrothal geese,

510
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:46,400
aren't they all under your care?

511
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,959
Then this is my fault?

512
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:51,560
No, no.

513
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,599
Changfeng, Madam,

514
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:55,000
please tell them to stop.

515
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:57,160
My son won't win it.

516
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,719
Please have them stop.

517
00:24:58,719 --> 00:25:00,119
Please let them stop.

518
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:00,920
Madam!

519
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,800
If we lose the betrothal geese today,

520
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,880
I will skin him!

521
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:05,800
He isn't here.

522
00:25:07,719 --> 00:25:08,959
He really isn't.

523
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:10,199
Madam, Madam!

524
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:12,359
Your husband went to the front yard.

525
00:25:13,239 --> 00:25:14,199
Let's go.

526
00:25:14,199 --> 00:25:15,359
Madam!

527
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:17,680
I beg you, save my son!

528
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:21,000
Madam. Madam…

529
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,719
Go tell my son.

530
00:25:27,719 --> 00:25:28,560
Admit his fault to his father immediately,

531
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,560
that he is too naive to make that mistake.

532
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,560
Don't go easy on himself.

533
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,119
I understand.

534
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:33,920
Wait.

535
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,400
Master's servant Dongrong is always on good terms with us.

536
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,239
Go and find out what he knows.

537
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,959
My child made a mistake,

538
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:41,560
and as his mother,

539
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,560
I shouldn't really shield him.

540
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:43,239
I think the best way

541
00:25:43,239 --> 00:25:44,520
is a harsh flogging.

542
00:25:45,439 --> 00:25:46,599
Get his skin opened and flesh exposed,

543
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:48,160
so that the Madam can have her anger vented.

544
00:25:48,199 --> 00:25:48,800
Yes, Mistress.

545
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,520
I think,

546
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,680
as long as father and mother are on the same side,

547
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:15,160
losing the betrothal geese

548
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,880
won't matter much .

549
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,079
The prestige presented at the banquet

550
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:19,079
is all just vanity anyway.

551
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,760
We may lose the betrothal gift,

552
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,359
but that the Yuans instigate someone to win the gift

553
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:25,560
is embarrassing for them too.

554
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,160
We both lose our prestige

555
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,319
and that's not such a big deal then.

556
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:31,479
However,

557
00:26:31,479 --> 00:26:32,839
if the Master and the Madam of the house

558
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:34,199
start to argue in front of the guests,

559
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:36,040
that'd make us the laughing-stock

560
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,280
of Yangzhou City.

561
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:47,160
This little bastard you raised!

562
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:48,160
The Eldest Sister said

563
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,920
as long as the Master and the Madam were on the same side,

564
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:51,079
losing it doesn't matter at all.

565
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,880
Look.

566
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,920
Look at your daughter.

567
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,400
She can consider us in all matters.

568
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,160
But you failed her like this!

569
00:27:03,479 --> 00:27:04,760
I'm Hua'er's father.

570
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,680
I..I can't outargue you!

571
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,880
Where's Changbai? Where's Changbai?

572
00:27:10,199 --> 00:27:10,839
The Second Young Master is looking at the border map

573
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,880
in the study.

574
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:13,359
Tell him to come now.

575
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:14,199
What's the point of calling him?

576
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,319
He only knows his book.

577
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:16,199
Lower your voice.

578
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:17,920
Great.

579
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,719
What are you doing?

580
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:23,040
I will go do it for him.

581
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:25,599
Be patient.

582
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,560
Wait for Changbai to come first.

583
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,040
You throw ten times and may not even get one in.

584
00:27:30,439 --> 00:27:31,479
You think this isn't humiliating enough,

585
00:27:31,479 --> 00:27:32,040
don't you?

586
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,959
Count up the scores.

587
00:27:35,719 --> 00:27:37,319
Second Brother Bai, seventeen points.

588
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,800
Third Brother Sheng, eleven points.

589
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,359
We still have two cun of incense.

590
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,560
Great.

591
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,439
He got it. Great.

592
00:27:43,439 --> 00:27:44,640
He got it!

593
00:27:49,719 --> 00:27:50,400
I was just

594
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,719
wondering why there was no one at the banquet?

595
00:27:52,439 --> 00:27:53,359
It turns out everyone is here

596
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:54,239
watching the pot-pitching game.

597
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,439
How is it, Feng'er?

598
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,319
It's just pot-pitching? Don't be nervous.

599
00:28:01,959 --> 00:28:02,800
Aim clearly.

600
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:06,599
If you dare to lose, I will beat you to death.

601
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:09,040
I, I...

602
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,640
What now? Do you admit that you have lost?

603
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:28,040
Alright, everyone.

604
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,119
Let's not watch the children's game.

605
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:30,000
Let's go!

606
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:30,839
Let's go drinking.

607
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:31,719
Yeah, this is just a game

608
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,520
and shouldn't go into effect.

609
00:28:33,239 --> 00:28:34,640
Let's go and enjoy ourselves.

610
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,640
Let's go back and drink.

611
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:37,280
Why are you leaving?

612
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:40,800
It scored.

613
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:45,800
Sixth Miss threw it!

614
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,599
Did you throw this?

615
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,520
Little girl,

616
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,560
do you really want to compete with me?

617
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,719
Even if I defeat

618
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,680
a little baby girl like you,

619
00:28:59,479 --> 00:29:00,520
it will bring me no honor.

620
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,439
Forget it. It is just for amusement.

621
00:29:03,439 --> 00:29:04,239
I give up.

622
00:29:05,239 --> 00:29:07,920
It's either a win or a loss.

623
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,119
By your Yangzhou's rules,

624
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:13,520
Third Brother Sheng lost by a lot earlier.

625
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:14,479
Do you admit that?

626
00:29:14,479 --> 00:29:15,839
Yes.

627
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:17,680
Fine, you have ambition.

628
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,400
I will compete with you.

629
00:29:19,479 --> 00:29:20,800
Can this child do it?

630
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:23,400
Ming'er knows how to play pot-pitching?

631
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:34,599
Brother Dongrong,

632
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:36,719
can we talk in private?

633
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,760
You hit it in the "ear", and that's four points.

634
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,239
Ming'er, when did you

635
00:30:02,239 --> 00:30:03,920
learn to play it so well?

636
00:30:03,959 --> 00:30:06,160
The score is tied now.

637
00:30:06,199 --> 00:30:08,160
Second Brother, you're about to

638
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,400
be defeated by this little girl now.

639
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:17,040
You're going to shoot into both ears?

640
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:37,959
Both ears are shot. Six points.

641
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,000
Six points.

642
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,439
Both ears and it's six points.

643
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:43,520
She definitely won't be able to catch up!

644
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:51,239
Can you do it?

645
00:30:51,239 --> 00:30:52,640
Have you got a way?

646
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:54,119
She definitely won't be able to catch up.

647
00:30:55,719 --> 00:30:57,119
Ming'er,

648
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,040
Forget it. Don't play anymore.

649
00:30:59,439 --> 00:31:00,199
Stop it. Okay?

650
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:01,839
Okay, everyone.

651
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:02,839
Let's go back and drink.

652
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:03,479
Right!

653
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,839
It's okay to lose.

654
00:31:08,719 --> 00:31:09,959
Let's go. She definitely won't be able to catch up.

655
00:31:48,719 --> 00:31:50,359
Great.

656
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:52,199
Leaning on the pole. Ten points!

657
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:53,640
Leaning on the pole. Ten points!

658
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,119
We won!

659
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,000
We won!

660
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,280
We won! We won!

661
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,719
That's ten points?

662
00:32:08,479 --> 00:32:09,760
The north wind is blowing!

663
00:32:10,439 --> 00:32:11,280
Everyone, go into the house now.

664
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,680
Let's go.

665
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,000
Hurry up.

666
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,199
Quickly, over there.

667
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,479
My dear nephew.

668
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,640
What a timely wind.

669
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:36,680
That's right.

670
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,079
You are the leader who delivered the betrothal gifts.

671
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:42,119
Everyone is waiting to drink with you.

672
00:32:46,479 --> 00:32:47,479
This is for you.

673
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:17,479
Is this yours?

674
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:21,160
I have never seen this drawing.

675
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:21,959
Let me take a look.

676
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,479
You're so skilled.

677
00:33:24,479 --> 00:33:25,560
You need me to lend you something?

678
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:27,560
Young Master, take it easy,

679
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,439
just let me have a look!

680
00:33:28,719 --> 00:33:29,920
I will treat you to a meal tomorrow.

681
00:33:36,479 --> 00:33:38,119
You are a guest from a distant place.

682
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:40,000
Our family did our best to treat you.

683
00:33:40,439 --> 00:33:42,479
But you messed up our banquet.

684
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,000
You even have the audacity to borrow this drawing?

685
00:33:45,199 --> 00:33:47,239
There are hundreds of bird drawings out there.

686
00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:48,199
Whatever birds you want.

687
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:51,439
Just leave now.

688
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,280
I don't want some wild geese.

689
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,640
Brother Yuan told me to do it.

690
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:00,319
I didn't know it would disturb your family's banquet.

691
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:01,839
I'm quite sorry.

692
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:03,719
That must be the map

693
00:34:03,719 --> 00:34:04,400
of the Sixteen Prefectures of Yan and Yun.

694
00:34:05,439 --> 00:34:06,400
What business does it have to do with you?

695
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,639
How can it be none of my business?

696
00:34:11,479 --> 00:34:13,239
If we don't snatch back the Sixteen Prefectures of Yan and Yun,

697
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,439
our dynasty will face a future of disasters.

698
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,159
So are you

699
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,560
planning to snatch it from me by force?

700
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,840
If everyone in Dongjing

701
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,600
is like you,

702
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:23,840
provoking cats and teasing dogs,

703
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,520
all ignoring his duties,

704
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,439
snatching back the Sixteen Prefectures of Yan and Yun

705
00:34:27,439 --> 00:34:28,479
is a fool's dream.

706
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,719
Today's game of pot-pitching for the geese

707
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,040
is indeed my fault.

708
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:37,040
I am willing to swear

709
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,360
I will never engage in gambling with pot-pitching again.

710
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,040
I don't trust you

711
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,080
even if you swear.

712
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,360
I swear in the name of my deceased mother

713
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,760
that I will never engage with pot-pitching again!

714
00:34:50,479 --> 00:34:52,719
That's too serious there.

715
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,280
You needn't do that.

716
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,000
My style name is Zhonghuai.

717
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,840
Zecheng.

718
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,399
I always tell you to behave with prudence.

719
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:10,840
Don't try to stand out.

720
00:35:11,399 --> 00:35:13,239
I didn't.

721
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,560
So the pot-pitching today wasn't?

722
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:16,919
But if I didn't do it,

723
00:35:16,959 --> 00:35:18,919
Eldest Sister's betrothal geese would be gone.

724
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:21,199
Your Eldest Sister is not like you.

725
00:35:21,639 --> 00:35:23,919
Your Fourth Sister is not like you either.

726
00:35:23,919 --> 00:35:24,840
Do you know that?

727
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,760
Your Eldest Sister's mother

728
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,959
has a powerful family

729
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,600
so she gets nobility .

730
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:34,320
Mistress Lin is the most favored,

731
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,239
so she gets dignity.

732
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,520
They are from a higher class.

733
00:35:39,479 --> 00:35:40,520
They are different from me.

734
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,879
I was sold here because my family member had been ill

735
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:46,040
and needed money for medicine.

736
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:48,280
You always teach me

737
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,639
one must have sense and gratitude above all else.

738
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:51,919
When it became cold,

739
00:35:51,919 --> 00:35:53,040
Eldest Sister gifted you

740
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,159
this cloak.

741
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,959
Don't tell me you want to

742
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,679
watch her lose her betrothal gifts?

743
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:01,000
Eldest Sister cares about you, and you care about her in turn.

744
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,639
Of course, this is good.

745
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:04,719
But some pain for her,

746
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:07,600
it's just superficial.

747
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,439
But on you,

748
00:36:09,439 --> 00:36:12,040
it's bone-piercing pain.

749
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,360
You bastard! Bastard! Bastard!

750
00:36:37,439 --> 00:36:39,080
Mother, stop beating me.

751
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,719
I know that I was wrong, I was wrong!

752
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,439
What are you doing?

753
00:36:47,439 --> 00:36:50,000
Why did you bring Ru'er here?

754
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,360
Father, my eldest sister

755
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,600
is still crying in her room.

756
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,280
You've lost our face

757
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,320
totally!

758
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,000
I'm here to ask Third Brother.

759
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,719
What grudge does he have with her?

760
00:37:01,399 --> 00:37:02,639
He's just a lame child

761
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:03,600
who can't be of much use.

762
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,639
Dear Little Sister,

763
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:11,479
help me give some good words to your sister.

764
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:13,719
My brother was momentarily careless.

765
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:14,719
He was drunk.

766
00:37:15,439 --> 00:37:16,520
We are really sorry.

767
00:37:17,959 --> 00:37:19,520
Why should I help you?

768
00:37:19,959 --> 00:37:21,080
Momentarily careless?

769
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:23,040
I think there's no one lucid

770
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,320
in the house anymore.

771
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,360
The concubines in the other houses

772
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,280
get their children raised in the main Madam's yard.

773
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,320
What about you?

774
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,760
Master and Madam are so kind to me

775
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,600
so that I can

776
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:36,760
raise Mo'er and Feng'er by my side.

777
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:39,239
I will always remember

778
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:40,639
Master and Madam's mercy.

779
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,840
I only worry about that I can't repay you.

780
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,919
Repay? This is how you repaid me?

781
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,479
A great happy banquet

782
00:37:47,479 --> 00:37:49,320
and he just nearly lost

783
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,879
Hua'er's betrothal geese to the Yuans!

784
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,560
It's all Feng'er's fault.

785
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,360
He's young and can't measure things well.

786
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:58,439
He was forced to drink by those around him.

787
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,120
He was completely drunk that he committed this mistake.

788
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:04,719
Madam is always so kind

789
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:05,479
and merciful.

790
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,560
Who doesn't know that?

791
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,040
I don't dare to beg for your forgiveness.

792
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,399
I only beg . . .

793
00:38:12,439 --> 00:38:14,439
I only beg . . .

794
00:38:14,439 --> 00:38:17,199
You put on that pretense of a pitiful look,

795
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:18,239
so if I punish him severely,

796
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:21,879
it will seem that I am too harsh.

797
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:24,000
I did not nurture the children well enough.

798
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,000
I will not object

799
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,199
if you wish to beat him up.

800
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,439
Alright then.

801
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:33,760
You tell me. What the punishment should be?

802
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,879
Beat him.

803
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:42,000
Beat him twenty strokes.

804
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,520
Twenty?

805
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,840
Make it thirty then.

806
00:38:52,919 --> 00:38:54,639
No, Madam,

807
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:56,080
or he will be a cripple!

808
00:38:58,479 --> 00:38:59,959
Fine, make it thirty then.

809
00:39:01,919 --> 00:39:02,800
Mother!

810
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,280
My brother only knows how to read books

811
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,120
and he's just recovered from his recent illness.

812
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:08,399
He will die from thirty strokes!

813
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,199
Shut up!

814
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,879
Only thirty strokes of flogging,

815
00:39:12,879 --> 00:39:13,840
and that's due to

816
00:39:13,879 --> 00:39:14,959
Madam's mercy.

817
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:18,959
My son committed such a embarrassing thing to the family

818
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:21,760
and I don't dare to flog him myself.

819
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,679
May Master's attendant Dongrong

820
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:24,679
carry out the punishment

821
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:27,239
to display fairness.

822
00:39:29,959 --> 00:39:32,320
I failed to be strict in teaching my son.

823
00:39:32,399 --> 00:39:34,080
I am sorry for Eldest Miss's disgrace,

824
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,959
and I am even sorrier for Madam's displeasure.

825
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:39,000
Master, please have him beaten harshly.

826
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,159
Wife, what do you think?

827
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:46,360
Beat him.

828
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,239
Beat him.

829
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:57,439
Let's go, Third Brother.

830
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,080
You account it in your mind.

831
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,520
You must remember this your whole life

832
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,760
why you're being beaten!

833
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,360
One.

834
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:21,639
Two.

835
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:28,199
That one's always tricky.

836
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:30,280
I didn't find any mistake in her.

837
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:35,679
She was so docile this time,

838
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:37,639
letting her precious son

839
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:38,719
get beaten.

840
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:41,479
I was going to use this chance

841
00:40:41,479 --> 00:40:42,479
to get back the keys,

842
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,000
but I found no time to mention it.

843
00:40:46,879 --> 00:40:48,439
I don't get it either.

844
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:50,399
I guess this time.

845
00:40:50,399 --> 00:40:52,719
she saw that Master was so angry,

846
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:53,520
so she elected to sacrifice the knight

847
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:53,919
to save the queen?

848
00:40:54,879 --> 00:40:56,399
Don't you see?

849
00:40:56,399 --> 00:40:57,679
The beatings

850
00:40:57,919 --> 00:41:00,040
made the Master vent his anger

851
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,399
and start to cherish her again.
