00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,375
Episode 69

3
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,880
What's wrong?

4
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,920
Didn't I just get home a few days ago?

5
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,160
A fire broke out in our house.

6
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,280
Then?

7
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,720
I killed Madam Kang.

8
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,440
Madam Kang? That one from the House of Wang?

9
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,880
The daughter of the late Imperial Tutor Wang You,

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,920
my wife's maternal aunt, Wang Ruoyu.

11
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,800
Are you crazy?

12
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,240
If it was you,

13
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,160
when someone wants to kill your wife and son,

14
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,160
can you endure to just give her some scoldings?

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,840
This...

16
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,880
Is she crazy?

17
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,800
Exactly.

18
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,760
If I didn't do anything that time,

19
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,920
I fear that my wife and son would have bled right there.

20
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,520
I can only draw my sword and kill her.

21
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,520
Then how come

22
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,880
I didn't get any news

23
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,040
these past days?

24
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,440
Right.

25
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,720
I initially thought that

26
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,440
biased Old Madam Wang

27
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,560
would be suing me in the morning court the next day.

28
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,760
Never thought that

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,560
they haven't made any move until now.

30
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,280
During the morning court these past days,

31
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,800
that Wang official

32
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,080
didn't say a word at all.

33
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,600
The Court of Judiciary and the Kaifeng Precinct

34
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,200
didn't send me any messages too.

35
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,760
I fear that they are waiting

36
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,640
for all fingers

37
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,000
to form a fist,

38
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,040
and then hit me with it in one go.

39
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,880
Who cares?

40
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,800
Anyway, that Madam Kang

41
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,240
had so many lives

42
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,160
lost in her hands.

43
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,560
Can she really sue me?

44
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,360
Zhonghuai, Zhonghuai...

45
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,360
It's not that I want to lecture you.

46
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,600
You are so absurd.

47
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,320
Before, he almost burned down

48
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,000
the courtyard of my Tingwei.

49
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,600
You all wouldn't meddle.

50
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,440
Now that this Tingbing killed someone

51
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,080
in the area he was exiled to,

52
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,160
you both finally remembered me.

53
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,960
Sister-in-law,

54
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,040
it's not that we didn't want to meddle.

55
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,480
Look, the Fifth House has already sided with the adjacent courtyard.

56
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,160
Just our house wouldn't be able to deal with them,

57
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,480
isn't that right?

58
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,320
Sister-in-law,

59
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,280
you mustn't misunderstand us.

60
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,880
Actually, we so want that

61
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,360
adjacent courtyard to fall as soon as possible,

62
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,640
so we can fetch our Tingbing back,

63
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,840
isn't it?

64
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,000
You won't be able to have him back anymore.

65
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,440
He has been exiled 3,000 miles from here,

66
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,120
and still had to be envious and compete with others,

67
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,640
killing a man just for a prostitute.

68
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,880
Not only I,

69
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,960
but even gods

70
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,440
won't be able to save him.

71
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:20,960
Sister-in-law,

72
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,640
what then can we do?!

73
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,680
What can I do to your family?

74
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,280
And what can I make your family do?

75
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,000
Say something.

76
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,440
Sister-in-law, I've seen this tea

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,400
when I entered the palace

78
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,760
to thank the graces of Empress Dowager.

79
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,120
It seems that since you've

80
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,760
sided with Empress Dowager,

81
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,280
and obtained some tea leaves from her,

82
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,240
you don't want to acknowledge relatives like us.

83
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,520
How come I do not acknowledge your family?

84
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,520
I fear that it was your family who doesn't recognize me anymore.

85
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,000
How could we?

86
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,080
As the saying goes, even a strong man would require help from others.

87
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,280
Sister-in-law, if you have any problems,

88
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,240
our family would surely

89
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,000
do our best to help you.

90
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,480
Thinking about before,

91
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,200
all of the people in this house,

92
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,520
who didn't harm Gu Tingye?

93
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,000
Who didn't frame him

94
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,640
with those dirty things in their hands?

95
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,960
Does that Fifth House think that

96
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,800
if they defend him this time,

97
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,720
he will already treat them

98
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,040
as trustworthy relatives?

99
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,840
Idiot!

100
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,560
Right.

101
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,120
You two should also think about

102
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,080
what harm have you inflicted on him.

103
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,160
Those past debts

104
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,360
have already been made.

105
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,040
What's the use of mentioning them now?

106
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,640
What if that Gu Tingye

107
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,120
dies?

108
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,440
Dies?

109
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,040
You're saying...

110
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,360
Empress Dowager?

111
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,960
Empress Dowager.

112
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,960
Only Empress Dowager.

113
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,800
While Empress Dowager is still around,

114
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,120
we must topple this demonic star.

115
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,840
He has the emperor in front, Prince Huan at the back.

116
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,720
With the rapidity of his promotions

117
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,600
and the hotness of his temper,

118
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,400
how can we still have any path to survive?

119
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,680
As long as he doesn't die,

120
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,120
Tingbing will forever

121
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,280
stay in his place of exile.

122
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,080
If he dies,

123
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,080
Empress Dowager might

124
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,360
even have a conferred title for Tingbing.

125
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,080
Slow down.

126
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,520
Place it in an orderly manner.

127
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,240
Hence, may Your Majesty

128
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,200
quickly make a decision regarding the border matters.

129
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,840
Either we open a trading market to improve the economy,

130
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,000
so we can go around the lost passes in and out,

131
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,160
and have 10 years of peace.

132
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,560
Or organize our army, increase their winter clothes

133
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,840
to protect the soldiers in the borders from the chill,

134
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,120
and prepare for a huge battle ahead.

135
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:33,360
The widow of Imperial Tutor Wang You is

136
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,640
drumming the Dengwen Drums outside the palace hall, and

137
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:38,400
wants to submit grievances to Your Majesty.

138
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,480
Subject Wang, what grievances are there

139
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,720
that would toil your old mother

140
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,880
to drum the Dengwen Drums

141
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,120
during our morning court?

142
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,200
I...

143
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,580
Before, I practiced loyalty in assisting meritorious subjects

144
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,120
in planning and managing affairs.

145
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,440
I've gathered virtuous hall of great scholars

146
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,640
along with the councilors of the Imperial Secretariat.

147
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,200
I am the eldest direct son of the honored Imperial Tutor Wang You,

148
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,400
with posthumous name Wenjian,

149
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,800
together with Qianshu Wang Shiping of the Bureau of Military Affairs,

150
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,360
I am suing Gu Tingye for murdering my little sister,

151
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,640
the wife of Head Secretary Kang Haifeng,

152
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,400
the conferred lady Wang Ruoyu!

153
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,440
Allow her to come in.

154
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,000
Come in!

155
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,680
Marquis killed my daughter

156
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,840
with one stab in her chest.

157
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,560
Her corpse is currently not yet buried.

158
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,640
Any coroner can go and examine her.

159
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:01,190
May I ask Your Majesty to investigate this wisely,

160
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,360
and make a decision.

161
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,920
Informing Your Majesty,

162
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,320
I want to say a few words to argue this matter.

163
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,720
I can't just listen to one side.

164
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,680
Do you still have any evidence?

165
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,400
I have material evidences and witnesses on how Gu Marquis

166
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,200
set up the fire in the marquis manor. They are all noted down in here.

167
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,080
May Your Majesty personally read it.

168
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,640
It means...you have witnesses then?

169
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,680
Yes. They are just waiting to be called by Your Majesty.

170
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,600
Royal Father, this matter has huge implications.

171
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,640
Why not listen to

172
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,760
Gu Marquis's defense first?

173
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,480
Prince Huan is right.

174
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,920
Gu Marquis, do you have anything want to say?

175
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,560
May Gu Marquis allow my family's witnesses

176
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,480
to enter the court.

177
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,360
Gu Marquis, do you dare to?

178
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,200
You think I'll be afraid of you?

179
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,560
Your Majesty,

180
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,480
in examining a case, material evidence, witnesses,

181
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,560
and a corpse must all be present.

182
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,280
Why not Your Majesty first listen to

183
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,600
the evidence before listening to the defense?

184
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,200
When your Censorate report a memorial,

185
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,560
there should be prepared written scrolls or paperwork.

186
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,240
Does this sudden case

187
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,240
also belong to the matters

188
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,760
under the jurisdiction of your Censorate?

189
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,720
Your Majesty,

190
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,200
the case should be handled to

191
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,800
the Kaifeng Precinct and the Court of Judiciary.

192
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,720
But since Old Madam Wang entered the court

193
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,400
after hitting the Dengwen Drums,

194
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,900
the Censorate and Remonstrance Bureau

195
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,480
are both commissioned by the government

196
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,160
to proofread and rectify any mistakes. I have to ask.

197
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Okay then. Let them in.

198
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,200
Calling!

199
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,040
What are you laughing about?

200
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,360
The actors are coming.

201
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,600
You still have the nerve to laugh?

202
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,320
Where are your witnesses?

203
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,920
Your Majesty.

204
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,680
That day, I just entered the city gates

205
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,000
and already saw my house on fire.

206
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,640
I rode my horses as fast as I could to rush back to my house

207
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,960
and just happened to see my wife delivering our child.

208
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,080
That Wang Ruoyu was holding a bladed weapon

209
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,160
and wanted to kill my wife

210
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,920
while she was still weak from laboring.

211
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,800
Seeing how blood will soon be spilled,

212
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,680
I have no choice but to draw my sword to defend her.

213
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,200
Then it means,

214
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,800
you're admitting that you killed her.

215
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,880
Old Madam Wang,

216
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,040
you didn't discipline your daughter.

217
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,000
Of course, the heaven will discipline her on your behalf.

218
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,960
And who knows if the fire in my house

219
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,320
was started by someone.

220
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,640
Don't you know how the fire started?

221
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,800
You killed the daughter of the House of Wang

222
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,200
and tried to destroy evidence,

223
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,240
so you started a fire in the marquis manor!

224
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,840
Grand Madam,

225
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,840
do you know how the fire

226
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,080
in my manor started?

227
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,520
You went to the courtyard of Tingwei

228
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,440
to start the fire.

229
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,160
Someone saw Gu Marquis

230
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,640
sending his subordinate Shitou

231
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,480
to start a fire in my son's courtyard.

232
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,040
The Wang daughter went there to put out the fire.

233
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,640
Put out the fire?

234
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,000
Our government has clear rules

235
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,840
that a soldier would be stationed

236
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,360
in the Fire Observing Deck everyday to monitor any fire.

237
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,520
Once there's a fire, he must immediately report it

238
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,880
so the local officials would gather a team

239
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,800
to put out the fire.

240
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,520
There's no need for citizens to do so.

241
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,520
This Wang woman is of prestigious aristocratic status.

242
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,840
She's unable to carry anything on her shoulders or by her hands,

243
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,480
how then will she put out the fire?

244
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,760
Out of kindness,

245
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,520
in consideration that she was a relative,

246
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,160
she tried to save your wife.

247
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,000
You beast...

248
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,920
Don't we still know who the beast is here?

249
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,080
You...

250
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,640
You killed my mother in your house

251
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,120
and then burned your manor

252
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,240
just to destroy her corpse.

253
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,640
By doing that,

254
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,200
aren't you afraid of getting struck by lightning?

255
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,960
Madam Qin is the direct mother of Gu Marquis.

256
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,040
If her testimony isn't real,

257
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,760
why would she accuse her own family?

258
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,120
I personally saw you ordered your men

259
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,440
to start the fire.

260
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,720
I was so shocked that my soul almost left my body.

261
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:11,000
You vile spawn still want to deny it?

262
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,600
If you all claim that Wang woman was thinking

263
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,400
for my sake, since she was a guest in my manor,

264
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,120
where's the visitation card?

265
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,720
Who entertained her?

266
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,280
Who served her tea and food?

267
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,000
Who opened the doors

268
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,120
of my Cheng Garden for her,

269
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,880
and guided her through the middle receiving hall,

270
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,320
and brought her into Jiaxi House?

271
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,320
My wife's life was in danger.

272
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,680
The fire in my manor was burning up into the sky.

273
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,040
How could that weak woman

274
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,360
have entered my inner courtyard?!

275
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,160
You're saying my daughter entered your manor to kill?

276
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,480
She's the maternal aunt of that Sheng Madam.

277
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,720
Let me ask you then,

278
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,960
what grudges does she have to attempt

279
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,200
to kill that Sheng Minglan?!

280
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,120
What grudges?

281
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,120
She just wants to kill her.

282
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,280
Why would my daughter

283
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,000
go to your marquis manor

284
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,440
to kill your wife?

285
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:07,040
Say it. Say it!

286
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,400
When an evil woman kills people,

287
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,720
does she still needs reasons?

288
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,000
Nonsense!

289
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,400
My mother and your mother-in-law

290
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,920
are blood-related sisters.

291
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,240
You are an important government official.

292
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,640
What reasons do my mother have

293
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,920
to kill

294
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,800
her own niece?!

295
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,280
After killing so many people,

296
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,960
does she still need a reason to kill another one?

297
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,600
What nonsense are you saying?

298
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,440
Your Majesty, I鈥?

299
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,080
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

300
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,200
The murder reasons of an evil woman like that

301
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,520
can't be guessed by ordinary people like us.

302
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,160
I indeed killed her.

303
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,240
But if I didn't raise my sword that day,

304
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,400
my wife would have died then.

305
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,840
May Your Majesty give me justice!

306
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,920
The Dengwen Drum is an object to voice out grievances.

307
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,920
Today, a grievance was presented.

308
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,360
Gu Marquis is a loyal subject

309
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,560
attending to me.

310
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,680
Each of you are fulfilling your duty,

311
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,320
all unyielding,

312
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,040
thus building the thousand-year government of my dynasty,

313
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,280
the Court of Judiciary will assist Kaifeng Precinct

314
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,840
in accepting all your testimonies and evidences.

315
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,000
Once they've organized it, they will start the trial.

316
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,640
Your Majesty is wise!

317
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,240
Zhonghuai!

318
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,240
Zhonghuai!

319
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,520
Say something!

320
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,600
What really are you planning? You...

321
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,240
Don't mention about

322
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,320
today's matter again.

323
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,720
Or else, I will sever our relationship

324
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,040
and will never enter your Sheng Manor again.

325
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,560
Don't enter then?

326
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,640
No one would care.

327
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,840
It's just that your main wife,

328
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,200
my Sixth Little Sister, won't allow it.

329
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,000
Don't argue here.

330
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,560
Let's go back and discuss it properly.

331
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,880
Earlier, you blocked off

332
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,320
what I was about to say in the court.

333
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,840
You said that you have plans.

334
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,080
What is it?

335
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,760
I can't tell my plans.

336
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,520
You can think that

337
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,960
I can't say it to outsiders.

338
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,400
This is my family's matter.

339
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,300
How am I an outsider?

340
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,720
Then...I don't have any plans.

341
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,960
Okay.

342
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,880
I'll submit a report

343
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,600
to the Court of Judiciary later.

344
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,200
Shitou!

345
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:28,880
Young Master!

346
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,480
Move him to his carriage.

347
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:35,800
Okay, Marquis.

348
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,000
Father-in-law,

349
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,240
if I say the truth

350
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,440
in the court earlier...

351
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,160
I understand. I understand.

352
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,000
Watch him well.

353
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,400
If he runs towards the palace hall

354
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,720
and do some testimony,

355
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,640
even there are ten of me, I can't do anything about it.

356
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,880
I'll keep an eye on him. Keep an eye on him.

357
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,880
Is my wife asleep?

358
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,840
It's already the first part of zi time. She's asleep.

359
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,920
You...

360
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,080
Aren't you asleep already?

361
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,640
You still have to come home.

362
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,120
You can't hide forever.

363
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,800
I went to the Western Outskirt Military Camp.

364
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,640
That Xiao Duan is sloppy.

365
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,800
While I'm not around,

366
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,080
he wasn't even able to train them on how to tie a horse well.

367
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,320
The whole capital already knows.

368
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,600
Why must you still hide it from me?

369
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,800
Second Brother refuses to drag you down.

370
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,440
You also refuse to

371
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,240
harm his future.

372
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,480
I know all of it. I understand.

373
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,120
But, you should know to weigh the urgency.

374
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,350
You must say it.

375
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,000
I can't say it.

376
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,880
If I say it, the future of your Second Brother

377
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,640
will get completely destroyed.

378
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,800
Your future will get destroyed.

379
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,320
The future of your sisters

380
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,120
will all get destroyed.

381
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:48,880
Your father and your Third Brother's future

382
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,040
will all get destroyed.

383
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,000
I caused you trouble.

384
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,880
It was my fault.

385
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,560
It was...me who brought you trouble.

386
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,200
I...

387
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,900
The person form the adjacent house wants to kill me,

388
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,320
that's why, she lured your Maternal Aunt Kang here.

389
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,840
You didn't cause me any harm.

390
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,200
It was me who's brought you trouble.

391
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,240
We have a house full of relatives

392
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,520
who just won't give us peace.

393
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,920
It's not who dragging down whom.

394
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,400
The two of us are together.

395
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,000
But if there wasn't me,

396
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,120
without my family, you...

397
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,000
Without you...

398
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,600
If there wasn't you,

399
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,520
I'm now just a duckweed.

400
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:04,400
Every day I wake up,

401
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,840
seeing you lying by my side,

402
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:10,120
I feel very contented.

403
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,640
I feel that everything is enough.

404
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,840
Don't worry.

405
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,520
Your husband is very outstanding.

406
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,440
I've never lost.

407
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,560
Moreover,

408
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,160
I still have the emperor as my backer.

409
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,040
Who can defy him,

410
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,720
right?

411
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,920
I'm afraid. I'm so afraid.

412
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,560
I'm going now.

413
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,120
I'll wait for your return.

414
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,560
I'll cook your favorite bamboo shoots

415
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,160
in chicken broth.

416
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,360
I'm going now.

417
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,520
Your Majesty,

418
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,440
the Court of Judiciary assisted the Kaifeng Precinct

419
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,160
and did the interrogations for several days.

420
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,160
The servants of the Gu Marquis said that

421
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,840
they indeed saw Madam Kang trying to kill someone.

422
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,680
But the servants of Grand Madam Qin instead said

423
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,320
that Madam Kang went there to help.

424
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,640
Because both are trusted aides of the two houses,

425
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,600
and they are contradictory, hence, for now,

426
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,000
we can't consider any of their testimonies.

427
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,720
Just continue investigating then.

428
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,200
Based on the current situation, we can't abandon the soldier to save the general.

429
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,000
The old subjects from Yuzhou has successively suffered false accusations.

430
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,800
This is a tactic to sow discord.

431
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,080
Your Majesty is wise. You surely can discern it.

432
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,300
If you really remove Zhonghuai from office,

433
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,840
who then will take his position

434
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,640
as the capital commander?

435
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,560
You and Your Highness are both living deep in the palace.

436
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,200
Who can you really trust?

437
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,840
When the Court of Judiciary asked about the murder weapon,

438
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,120
Gu Marquis couldn't hand it out.

439
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,680
He said that it got lost amidst the chaos of the fire.

440
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,480
The Court of Judiciary then said that they are unable to close this case.

441
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,500
I think鈥?

442
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,040
It's now a situation that everyone

443
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,280
sticks to their own version.

444
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,480
Gu Marquis is unable to say Madam Kang's reason

445
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,920
for attempting to murder his wife.

446
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,880
The House of Wang is also unable to provide any evidence

447
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,160
that Madam Kang didn't try to kill the marchioness.

448
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,160
How then will this case be closed?

449
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,080
Just continue looking for witnesses and evidence.

450
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,760
That Second indeed

451
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,920
is usually sloppy.

452
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,600
But he never did any of your orders

453
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,480
in a mediocre manner.

454
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,200
To say something disrespectful,

455
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,560
that salt taxation inspection,

456
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,240
my wife wouldn't

457
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,800
dare to let me go.

458
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,680
But his wife was pregnant,

459
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,520
yet he just left like that!

460
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,080
And it's because of that that this trouble started.

461
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,760
Your Majesty!

462
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,240
My emperor!

463
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,920
I don't understand anymore.

464
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,160
Why can't he

465
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,400
be forgiven?

466
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,080
Your Majesty,

467
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,720
the wife of Imperial Tutor Wang is almost in her seventies.

468
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,160
She holds her written complaint

469
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,880
and refuses to leave the trial hall of the Kaifeng Precinct.

470
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,300
The several members of the House of Wang

471
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,160
are blocking the local court's gates

472
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,600
and earnestly asking that the murderer be heavily punished.

473
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,400
The local magistrate has repeatedly urged them

474
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,400
but in vain. It has also invited numerous bystanders.

475
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,720
I just fear that public opinion is powerful enough to melt metal.

476
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,840
Who told you to come here and say those words?

477
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,040
The Empress Dowager?

478
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,640
Right now, everyone can see it clearly

479
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,960
that it was Empress Dowager

480
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:06,560
masterminding all these behind the curtains.

481
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,400
During the salt inspection last time,

482
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,640
it was she

483
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,320
who trapped me and General Shen.

484
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:13,920
She鈥?

485
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,840
She wants to cut off your arms.

486
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,200
Your Majesty,

487
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,120
I'm talking on behalf of the government.

488
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,080
Gu Marquis is a new subject.

489
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,360
The one he killed is the daughter of an old subject.

490
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,880
If you show any bias,

491
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,520
it will surely push subjects

492
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,560
to distance you.

493
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,160
Did you wipe my shoes clean?

494
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,800
I did already, Young Master.

495
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,840
Big Madam was watching me when I did it.

496
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,480
It's only Big Madam who cares for me.

497
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,880
You're always being lazy.

498
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,720
Marquis will surely not bear to.

499
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,320
Yuanruo, why did you suddenly come to

500
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,160
the line of the generals?

501
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,600
When I was helping to put out the fire,

502
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,520
I saw Madam Kang.

503
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,680
What?

504
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,360
I told her to be careful of the fire

505
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,560
and not wander around.

506
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,000
Who knew that she would go to the direction of the inner courtyard.

507
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,320
I found it strange,

508
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,000
so I followed her.

509
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,240
I then saw that instant

510
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,240
when she raised her knife to kill.

511
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,760
Let me ask you,

512
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,840
what was that woman wearing?

513
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,480
Clothes?

514
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,800
The matter was very urgent that time.

515
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,680
I didn't notice.

516
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,960
You surely can remember the color

517
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,640
of her clothes, right?

518
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,440
Dark blue.

519
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,960
Then...it's dark grey.

520
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,440
You guessed that based on her age,

521
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,400
the majority will be wearing dark clothes.

522
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,040
Hence, you thought of

523
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,960
those two colors.

524
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,600
Let me tell you,

525
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,200
that when you came to put out the fire that day,

526
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,480
Madam Kang has already died.

527
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,520
If you still can see her,

528
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,080
then you must have met a ghost.

529
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,640
I'm the only son of the Duke Qi of the State,

530
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,160
and is a deputy minister of the Remonstrance Bureau.

531
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,320
Someone will surely

532
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,560
believe my words.

533
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,440
Yuanruo.

534
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,000
You are an honest gentleman.

535
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,800
You're not good at lying.

536
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,720
Just these two questions of mine,

537
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,440
you were unable to answer.

538
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,120
If you meet those strict and oppressive officers

539
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,680
who has went through more than 80 murder cases

540
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,760
a year,

541
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,520
how would you handle them?

542
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,600
Not only would they ask you about

543
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,320
the color of her clothes,

544
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,200
they would even ask you about her hair pins,

545
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,400
her maid servant,

546
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,880
which path she took,

547
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,120
in which direction she went,

548
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,560
what bed I have in my house,

549
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,120
where it was placed.

550
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,040
Can you answer all of them?

551
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,720
I hate them for falsely accusing you.

552
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,000
Yuanruo.

553
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,000
I know that you sincerely

554
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,920
want to help me and my wife.

555
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,200
You don't mind fabricating testimony for it.

556
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,200
If we change places,

557
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,720
I might not be able to do what you're doing.

558
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,560
Let's do not talk about this first.

559
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,160
What are you planning?

560
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,080
I have the merit of saving the emperor.

561
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,040
What am I afraid of?

562
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,520
Open the palace gates!

563
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,680
Bow!

564
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,800
Enter the palace!

565
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,560
Big Madam, it's time for your medicine.

566
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,760
Another medicine for supplementing my blood and qi?

567
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,560
Madam! Madam!

568
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,920
Don't drink first!

569
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:51,960
Madam.

570
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,960
Informing Big Madam,

571
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,280
when Xiaotao raised the pot

572
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,200
after cooking the medicine earlier,

573
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,160
Nanny Chang just happened to come in

574
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,400
and got Rong'er some pear soup.

575
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,760
She then noticed the dregs of the medicine concoction.

576
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,025
Madam,

577
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,000
before my maiden family fell,

578
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,920
we were owners of a pharmacy.

579
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,840
I can identity a lot of medicinal herbs.

580
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,960
When I saw the dregs, I immediately found something wrong.

581
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,760
I was able to find these.

582
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,900
These...what are these?

583
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,200
In our province,

584
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,800
we call this blood depleting herb.

585
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,800
With it,

586
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,800
any blood and qi supplementing medicines

587
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,800
won't work.

588
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,760
You can't see the effect immediately.

589
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,480
But if used chronically,

590
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,160
it surely will harm your main qi channels.

591
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,600
A person will be like the withering leaves

592
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,960
during the autumn, thin and pallid.

593
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,240
No,

594
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,480
I didn't know how such things got placed

595
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,840
inside the medicine.

596
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,800
When I cook the medicine,

597
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,000
I never leave midway

598
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
nor snooze off.

599
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,480
I even carry a big needle

600
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,480
all the time.

601
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,360
It's to poke myself

602
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,440
whenever I feel sleepy.

603
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:45,960
Look.

604
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,720
Madam,

605
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,000
you must quickly tell Marquis to investigate this.

606
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,920
This matter must be investigated,

607
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,960
but it can't be done by him.

608
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,640
If those people from the military comes,

609
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,000
those evildoers

610
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,960
will surely get scared out of their wits.

611
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,680
They investigating would be more useful

612
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,800
than just us.

613
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,800
Now that there are too much trouble floating around,

614
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,080
the Kaifeng Precinct, the Court of Judiciary,

615
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,080
the Censorate, and the Remonstrance Bureau,

616
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,200
how many eyes are monitoring

617
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,200
my Marquis Husband right now?

618
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,560
If any problems happen here in the inner house,

619
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,720
it would just be adding a knife or a spear against him.

620
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,120
What do we do then?

621
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,120
How about when I make the medicine tomorrow,

622
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,800
I'll just do it here inside the room

623
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,920
using a small oven and pot?

624
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,680
Rather than stopping the soup from boiling by scooping some out,

625
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,000
it's better to just take away the logs from the cauldron.

626
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,280
Nanny.

627
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,800
I'm asking you to peek into each room

628
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,720
in this manor one by one.

629
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,320
You mustn't show that you are checking,

630
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,720
so as not to alarm the enemy

631
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,000
and allow them to escape.

632
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,120
I got it.

633
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,600
Since this person chose to poison me

634
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,480
at this instance,

635
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,920
it surely has connections

636
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,760
with the matters happening in the manor.

637
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,360
Xiaotao.

638
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,680
Return with me to the Sheng Manor to live for a few days.

639
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,600
Let us give them some space

640
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,760
to show their flaws.

641
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,520
Okay.

642
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,280
Prime Minister,

643
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,600
in the crime of Gu Marquis killing Madam Kang,

644
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,040
there are new complainants.

645
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:27,080
All the complainants are standing below the steps right now.

646
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,000
Why differentiate between old and new?

647
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,320
Prime Minister Han is trying this case on behalf of His Majesty.

648
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,840
I, Xiong Benli of the Censorate,

649
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,880
is filing a complaint against Gu Marquis of using his power to bully other people,

650
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,680
and forcefully taking away the assets of the Bai Family.

651
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,280
The different houses and farmlands

652
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,320
amount to a total of 2 million taels.

653
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,040
Someone also wants to accuse Gu Marquis

654
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,600
of abandoning her after dallying

655
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,320
with her and killing his own son.

656
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,240
Now, she is bowing outside

657
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,400
and waiting to be called as witness.

658
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,400
The eldest son of the Bai Family

659
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,520
and the whole Bai clan of the southern village

660
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,200
are also bowing outside

661
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,680
holding their written complaint.

662
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,160
So good.

663
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:26,960
You're coming back to complete your one month post partum?

664
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,600
I just miss the teas and soups

665
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,800
made by Nanny Cui.

666
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,880
Before going to the morning court, my Marquis Husband told me that

667
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:43,680
there are a lot of problems right now.

668
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,200
He told me to come back home and live here for a while.

669
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,250
As long as grandmother is by my side,

670
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,120
I can have less worries

671
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,040
and focus more on recuperating.

672
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,320
I have to ask grandmother and Second Brother

673
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,280
to feed me for a while then.

674
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,160
Your Second Brother is currently

675
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,880
being locked up at home

676
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,000
causing a ruckus all day.

677
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:09,120
Your father won't allow him to go out.

678
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,560
He hasn't attended the morning court for half a month.

679
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,640
I fear that since he doesn't have any salary,

680
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,000
he won't be able to feed you.

681
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,920
I haven't seen how Second Brother

682
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,240
looks like being locked up.

683
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,400
After lunch,

684
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,480
my Marquis Husband and I will go visit him

685
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,040
and laugh at his embarrassing state.

686
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,000
Marquis?

687
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,320
Will he also be coming?

688
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,160
Will he also be staying here?

689
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,760
If I come back to live,

690
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,880
of course, he must too.

691
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,160
Grandmother, don't worry.

692
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,640
I'll ask him to pay some kitchen fees.

693
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,320
Silly child.

694
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,120
These are just jokes.

695
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,600
How can our house not afford to feed you?

696
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,040
Marquis is very obedient to you.

697
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,240
I know that.

698
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,800
Now, you also want him

699
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,880
to be obedient to you.

700
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,800
Yes.

701
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,160
This is the way better

702
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,160
than how you used to be so cautious

703
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,640
and careful in grasping him.

704
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,880
This is how a good married couple should be,what good days are.

705
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,480
Stop right there!

706
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,400
You heartless

707
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,820
and ruthless man!

708
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,680
You killed your own son!

709
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,640
How can you have the nerve

710
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,000
to still live in this world?!

711
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:40,960
How could you still have the face!

712
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,000
Kneel and answer the questions!

713
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,800
You dragged Chang'er away from me

714
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,880
and caused him to die from illness.

715
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,000
You can harm me,

716
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,520
but why must you curse your own son to death?

717
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,040
He killed my older brother,

718
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,520
forcefully took me into his manor,

719
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,200
and then had me bear him two children.

720
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,080
He took away my daughter

721
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,000
and even kicked me out of his house.

722
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,040
I wouldn't.

723
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:14,440
He then killed our son.

724
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,960
He just killed our son

725
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,920
right in front of me!

726
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,560
Heaven!

727
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,360
You crazy woman!

728
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,800
Do you know that by doing this,

729
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,640
you're going to destroy Rong'er's life?

730
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,720
A sinister tiger will never even eat his own son.

731
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,720
Just to drive me away,

732
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,760
he...

733
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:39,240
killed my Chang'er right in front of me!

734
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,080
Prime Minister,

735
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,600
this woman must be crazy!

736
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,480
She is indeed crazy!

737
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,680
You used your power to bully other people!

738
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,880
Do you still want to fool the emperor?!

739
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,000
It's as if he can't do

740
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,240
such a sinister act.

741
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,120
Before, he caused his father to die in anger

742
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,520
inside the marquis manor.

743
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,440
Who in the whole Bianjing

744
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,560
doesn't know about that?

745
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:03,800
Shut up!

746
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,040
You mediocre idiot who only relies on

747
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,000
imperial blessings to survive.

748
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,320
What right do you have to mention my father?

749
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,720
What if it was me who mentions your father?

750
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,960
Prime Minister,

751
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,800
I'm the third wife of the late marquis.

752
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,880
That day,

753
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,040
it was because of this woman in this court

754
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,840
that Second and my husband had an altercation.

755
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,920
He didn't want the direct granddaughter of Imperial Tutor Yu

756
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,040
and insisted on marrying this woman.

757
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,920
The old marquis scolded him as being disobedient and unfilial.

758
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:40,960
Prime Minister,

759
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,480
I only had a minor argument

760
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,360
with my father.

761
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,080
Gu Tingye and his father

762
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,840
were quarreling in a rage.

763
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,280
His father was so mad that he vomited blood right there and then.

764
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:51,000
The daughter-in-law of Imperial Tutor Yu and I

765
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,560
saw that with our own eyes!

766
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,520
When my father vomited blood,

767
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,400
you and that Madam Yu weren't there.

768
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,120
If you don't believe me,

769
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,680
go and call Madam Yu as a witness.

770
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,120
Prime Minister,

771
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,800
towards this

772
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,600
Gu Marquis that I've personally raised,

773
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,040
I doted him more than my own son.

774
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,320
But he angered his father to death

775
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,520
and even started a fire to burn down

776
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,320
Gu Tingwei's courtyard.

777
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:26,880
That is trying to kill his own little brother!

778
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,280
Shut up.

779
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,480
You are distorting the truth!

780
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,160
You are not worthy to mention my father.

781
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,800
Since I was little, you praised me excessively so I would fail.

782
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,960
You sowed discord between me and my father.

783
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,160
In this life,

784
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,320
my father and I got destroyed all because of you!

785
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,800
Prime Minister,

786
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,000
when did that Gu Tingye

787
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,360
give any importance to the master-subject

788
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,400
or father-son relationship?

789
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,840
You killed your father and your son.

790
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,640
So it's a habit of yours

791
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,360
to kill your father and your son.

792
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,720
Prime Minister,

793
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,960
all these accusations

794
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,710
are complete nonsense.

795
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,800
All are aimed at

796
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,120
killing Gu Marquis.

797
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,180
I'm willing to personally handle this case

798
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,120
and clearly find the truth

799
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,920
behind it.

800
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,680
Prime Minister,

801
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,880
I'm willing to assist in this matter.

802
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,320
You are the son of the emperor.

803
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,520
You've grown

804
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,400
so tall and buff.

805
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,160
Do you know where my son is?

806
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:47,040
My son...

807
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,000
My son is buried under the ground.

808
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,400
Prime Minister,

809
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,880
don't listen to slanders!

810
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,040
Assholes!

811
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,520
All are just spouting nonsense!

812
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,880
You all are using your power to bully others!

813
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,720
You all are distorting the truth!

814
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,480
Gu Tingye!

815
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,320
You killed your own son!

816
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,560
You...killed your own son!

817
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,200
You...

818
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,720
You still dared to mention Chang'er?!

819
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,520
It's just right and proper for a killer to pay with his life.

820
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,160
I want you to pay with your life.

821
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,560
You killed my son.

822
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,160
I want you to pay with your life.

823
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,880
I want you to use your life in exchange for his!

824
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,920
I'm going to kill you!

825
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,400
Stop! Stop!

826
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,800
That woman said it right.

827
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,680
Stop! Stop!

828
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,960
Stop!

829
00:41:42,975 --> 00:41:44,800
That's being unruly while in front of the royal throne!

830
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,080
Zhonghuai, Zhonghuai,

831
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,160
Quickly let go!

832
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:47,960
A life for a life!

833
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:48,920
Stop!

834
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,800
That's being unruly while in front of the royal throne!

835
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,000
Let her talk!

836
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,400
Those two are crazy women!

837
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,040
You...

838
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,960
Do you still have other things to say?

839
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,240
Your subject...

840
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,800
oh, no. I, a lowly person,

841
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,120
want to file a complaint.

842
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:42,040
I'm accusing Gu Tingye

843
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,520
of fabricating a letter

844
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:46,800
to forcibly seize my Bai Family's estate
