The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,879
Episode 23

3
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,039
Let's go.

4
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:05,839
Let's go!

5
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,890
Xiaotao, jump in.

6
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:17,639
No.

7
00:01:17,639 --> 00:01:18,189
Jump in.

8
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:19,399
I can't swim!

9
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,799
Hold your breath. Hold your breath,

10
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:22,679
hurry up! Hurry!

11
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:24,799
Hold your breath.

12
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:25,999
Miss.

13
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:27,759
Hurry.

14
00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:30,300
Miss.

15
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,039
I can't go, Miss!

16
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,159
Hurry up! Jump in,

17
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:34,839
hurry up and go!

18
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:38,600
Hurry up!

19
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:57,319
She's in the water!

20
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,959
Get her!

21
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,519
Someone's there!

22
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:02,079
Catch her! Over there!

23
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,999
Brothers, get her!

24
00:02:32,999 --> 00:02:33,599
Get her!

25
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,439
She's fled!

26
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,910
Hurry!

27
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,479
Chase her!

28
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,599
Chase her!

29
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:43,079
Hurry!

30
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:17,039
Little girl, where is this place?

31
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:25,039
Did you change my clothes for me?

32
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,559
These are Auntie's.

33
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,239
Auntie combed my hair too?

34
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,079
Yes.

35
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:49,159
Drink ginger soup to warm up.

36
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,359
Did your family's master save me?

37
00:06:06,359 --> 00:06:09,519
My father saved you. You are cold.

38
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:10,839
Drink the ginger soup.

39
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:22,239
Rong'er. You're awake?

40
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:23,159
Father!

41
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,799
Was it you, Hero, who saved me?

42
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,079
Just a handy gesture.

43
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:30,999
No need to thank me.

44
00:06:32,999 --> 00:06:34,639
I wonder what is the Hero's name.

45
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,599
I'm a daughter from Bianjing's Sheng House.

46
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,319
I don't have anything on me right now,

47
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:44,759
but once I return home

48
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,399
I will reward you graciously with gratitude.

49
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,279
I'm a man.

50
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:50,599
I rescued you from the water.

51
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,879
You shouldn't tell me

52
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:52,799
your clan name.

53
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,879
That can tarnish your reputation in the future.

54
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:57,687
You, Hero, went into the water

55
00:06:57,687 --> 00:06:58,580
in the dark of night to save me.

56
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,018
It shows you are righteous

57
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,698
and what reputation to harm?

58
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,959
I never thought

59
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:08,199
in this life that the Sixth Miss of Sheng House

60
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:09,479
would call me righteous.

61
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,519
What a rarity.

62
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,599
How did you know?

63
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:18,799
Second Uncle?

64
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:22,439
Second Uncle Gu?

65
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:25,959
You! You...How are you here?

66
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,839
I'll give you something nice.

67
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:29,799
Very warm.

68
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:31,879
Where's my grandmother?

69
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,599
Did you save my grandmother?

70
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:34,319
Did you see her?

71
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,639
Rong'er,

72
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,279
go out and find Brother Shitou to play.

73
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,519
Don't worry.

74
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,759
Your grandmother is fine now.

75
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,719
I've already sent people to send her

76
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:45,639
to the command battalion to get settled.

77
00:07:46,359 --> 00:07:48,679
Your Sheng family boat is fine too,

78
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:49,959
with no damage and your maid!

79
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:51,319
Xiaotao?

80
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,559
Yes, they were all rescued.

81
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,039
But both the river

82
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:56,999
and shore paths

83
00:07:57,359 --> 00:07:58,519
are getting cleaned up from the tragedy

84
00:07:58,999 --> 00:07:59,719
and people can't pass through yet.

85
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:01,525
After they're done,

86
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:02,599
I'll find a small boat,

87
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:04,759
and take you back to your Sheng House ship.

88
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,279
Later,

89
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:07,679
when you see your Second Brother,

90
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,239
tell him I'm well in all ways,

91
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,719
so he needn't worry about me at all.

92
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:16,919
Second Uncle.

93
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:18,999
Why are you here?

94
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:21,199
You were right.

95
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:24,319
That Manniang has a black heart.

96
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,519
She took away my son.

97
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:30,559
I couldn't find her all over the Bianjing capital.

98
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,959
At first, I had some leads.

99
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,439
But after entering Guilin County,

100
00:08:37,439 --> 00:08:38,399
there were no trails anymore.

101
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,919
Guilin County to here

102
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,439
is really quite far.

103
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:44,759
Since I lost leads in Guilin County,

104
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:45,759
I suddenly

105
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:46,839
remembered

106
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,399
Shitou's brother and sister-in-law

107
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,919
are already the chiefs of the Canal Gang.

108
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,159
This Canal Gang makes their living by the river.

109
00:08:54,439 --> 00:08:55,479
Manniang has to find a way

110
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,959
either by river or on land.

111
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:57,879
So if I'm here,

112
00:08:58,199 --> 00:08:58,839
I can

113
00:08:58,839 --> 00:08:59,799
get more news.

114
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:01,025
I didn't know

115
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,999
Shitou's family and that gang

116
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:04,279
that attacked your boat

117
00:09:04,319 --> 00:09:05,279
had some clash,

118
00:09:05,439 --> 00:09:06,799
and I made a plan for them.

119
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,599
I ended up saving you coincidentally.

120
00:09:08,599 --> 00:09:09,799
That's fate too.

121
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,239
What about the Canal Gang?

122
00:09:16,319 --> 00:09:17,799
The Canal Gang is a group of men and women

123
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:19,359
that make a living carrying

124
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,279
and loading things around the docks.

125
00:09:20,719 --> 00:09:22,159
By the way,

126
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,439
they played a part in saving you too.

127
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:31,999
Fine. We've got enough firewood, right?

128
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,559
You're awake?

129
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,439
Sixth Miss is awake!

130
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:37,039
She's awake, Sister-in-law.

131
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:41,479
Shitou.

132
00:09:41,479 --> 00:09:42,239
You're awake!

133
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,079
Look at you.

134
00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:45,359
You're still so pretty

135
00:09:45,359 --> 00:09:46,399
wearing my coarse clothing.

136
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,959
Let's get by the fire there to warm up.

137
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:48,799
Thank you, Auntie.

138
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:49,599
So pretty.

139
00:09:50,119 --> 00:09:50,863
Sit here.

140
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,026
You must be cold.

141
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:54,706
Come, sit, sit.

142
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:55,479
I'm not cold.

143
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,119
Sit, sit.

144
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:06,159
I missed.

145
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:13,239
Second Uncle said you guys saved me.

146
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,319
Thank you.

147
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:17,119
What's there to thank? We should do that.

148
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,039
Those fish!

149
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,279
They just kill blindly.

150
00:10:20,479 --> 00:10:21,479
If they continue,

151
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,519
we won't be able to make our living.

152
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:24,839
Everyone will starve to death!

153
00:10:25,439 --> 00:10:26,839
Thankfully my brother Shitou

154
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:27,559
brought the Young Master here.

155
00:10:27,719 --> 00:10:28,599
He led us to handle

156
00:10:28,599 --> 00:10:29,919
those bandits a few times.

157
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:32,119
We saw they were going to rob the ships

158
00:10:32,119 --> 00:10:33,079
and we went on a stakeout.

159
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,803
Young Master said that this is called

160
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:37,265
"striking on half water..."

161
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:39,719
Sister-in-law, what are you saying?

162
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,479
It's called, "striking the enemy midway".

163
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,039
When your sister-in-law is talking,

164
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,079
you just listen. Why are you cutting in?

165
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:49,199
Anyway, what Young Master meant

166
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,999
was to make them rob a ship first.

167
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,439
Once they are less vigilant,

168
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:54,759
we'll attack them

169
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:55,679
and defeat them!

170
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,919
But while we were staking out,

171
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:00,839
when Young Master saw the fire burning,

172
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,679
he said that he knew the owner of the ship.

173
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:04,759
He doesn't care about them robbing

174
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:05,519
and attacking them midway anymore!

175
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:06,999
He just fiercely jumped into water

176
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:07,879
and saved people!

177
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:10,639
Never thought that the one he saved

178
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:12,039
was a pretty girl.

179
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:13,199
You totally

180
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,679
look like a princess.

181
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:19,679
Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

182
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:22,719
The wind outside is strong.

183
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:23,479
Just stay in your room.

184
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:41,719
Brother! Brother! Brother,

185
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:42,679
we won't fool around anymore.

186
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:44,799
Second Uncle...

187
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:46,519
I have something to tell you.

188
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:52,079
Second Uncle, when I asked about

189
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,639
how you've been doing after leaving the capital,

190
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:54,959
I wasn't gossiping.

191
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:56,959
I just want to bring my Second Brother

192
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:57,999
some good news.

193
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:00,519
When my Second Brother

194
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,359
mentions you at home,

195
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:03,119
he is

196
00:12:03,119 --> 00:12:04,279
always worried.

197
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,279
If you want to convince me to go back,

198
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,399
don't do it anymore.

199
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:12,999
I want to repay you

200
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:13,959
for saving my life.

201
00:12:19,119 --> 00:12:20,999
Last time, you told me that you're

202
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:22,239
repaying me for seeking a doctor for you.

203
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,159
Then you told me that Manniang

204
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,479
was harboring evil intentions.

205
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:27,239
Now you want to repay me again?

206
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,839
I'm scared of you now.

207
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:32,039
The one that's bad is the news

208
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:33,359
and not the person relaying the news.

209
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:35,759
What bad news are you going to

210
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:36,479
tell me this time?

211
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,599
Are you going to say

212
00:12:38,599 --> 00:12:39,479
that Rong'er

213
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,399
is also harboring evil intentions?

214
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:41,399
No. No.

215
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:45,959
While in the room, I saw

216
00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:47,519
how Rong'er kept being so afraid that I was cold,

217
00:12:47,719 --> 00:12:49,319
that she would tuck my blanket

218
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:50,959
and feed me ginger soup.

219
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,799
In my heart,

220
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:56,519
I sincerely hope that she'll live well.

221
00:12:58,599 --> 00:12:59,519
And?

222
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,919
And she's your daughter.

223
00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:03,519
Whatever kind of person you are,

224
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,639
that's how she will be.

225
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,679
If you are the Young Master of the Marquis House

226
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:07,839
then she's the noble daughter of the Marquis House.

227
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:10,679
Now, you are...

228
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:13,679
wandering in the world.

229
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,079
She'll then

230
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:16,639
become a daughter of a water pirate or bandit.

231
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,859
With the same sky and earth,

232
00:13:18,859 --> 00:13:19,839
that's like a cloud compared to the mud.

233
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:32,599
Aren't you just changing means to convince me

234
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:34,039
to go back on behalf of your Second Brother?

235
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,599
Chang'er has been taken away.

236
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:38,900
Rong'er

237
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,919
then must stay by my side.

238
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:42,439
I will never return to the House of Gu.

239
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:43,959
I'm not telling you

240
00:13:44,025 --> 00:13:45,759
to leave Rong'er and go back to the House of Gu.

241
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:46,679
It's the opposite.

242
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:48,250
I hope that

243
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:50,719
you don't foil the rest of her life

244
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,839
just because of a moment of ardent emotions.

245
00:13:58,599 --> 00:14:00,079
At a tender age

246
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,119
and still unmarried,

247
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,359
how would you know about the lives

248
00:14:03,359 --> 00:14:03,999
of one's children?

249
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:06,719
Although I don't have a daughter,

250
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:08,799
I'm still someone's daughter.

251
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:09,999
Don't I know the days of being a daughter?

252
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,599
Second Uncle, do you know?

253
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,919
Look at how happy Rong'er is.

254
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:26,999
She's happier here than in the capital.

255
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:29,959
Happier than when she was in Tianshui Alley.

256
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:31,719
She most probably will be happier here too

257
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:32,959
than in the Marquis Manor.

258
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:36,439
But you mustn't decide on the rest of her life

259
00:14:36,439 --> 00:14:37,479
just based on what you see now.

260
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:42,079
When I was little, my mother told be about

261
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,159
"Strategies of the Warring States".

262
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:48,599
Chu Long convincing Empress Dowager Zhao?

263
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,039
Yes. Yes. That part.

264
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:53,559
In there,

265
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:56,559
it was written that if parents love their child

266
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:57,839
they should think about their future.

267
00:14:59,119 --> 00:15:01,079
How could you just consider the present?

268
00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:04,039
At age three, you should be thinking about

269
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:06,039
how she should be at age sixteen.

270
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:07,578
If you don't have foresight,

271
00:15:07,578 --> 00:15:08,599
you surely will have future worries.

272
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:12,182
Your mother even read the

273
00:15:12,182 --> 00:15:13,199
"Strategies of the Warring States"?

274
00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:16,871
Second Uncle Gu, you don't know

275
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:17,951
that the happenings inside a home

276
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,839
would not pale in comparison with the battlefield.

277
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,439
How would I not know?

278
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,359
That stepmother of mine, Big Madam Qin,

279
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,359
doted on and spoiled me

280
00:15:33,359 --> 00:15:34,519
when I was little.

281
00:15:35,119 --> 00:15:37,119
She treated me better than all my brothers.

282
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:40,439
I lost a mother when I was little.

283
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:43,439
It's just natural that

284
00:15:43,439 --> 00:15:45,079
I treated her like my real mother.

285
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:48,199
But never thought that one day,

286
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:49,199
she would suddenly turn against me.

287
00:15:50,719 --> 00:15:52,239
She is really the demon.

288
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:58,759
Before attacking the city, attack its heart first.

289
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,519
Superb.

290
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:02,519
Don't even talk about the "Strategies of the Warring States".

291
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:04,759
Even if I have read

292
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:06,039
all the military strategy books in this world,

293
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:07,919
I fear that I will

294
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:08,999
still end up in my present state.

295
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:11,959
Is it not so for me as well?

296
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:16,199
I watched how my Little Mother died

297
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:17,039
from hemorrhage.

298
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:21,959
My own unborn little brother suffocated

299
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:23,399
inside her womb.

300
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:27,239
I went around

301
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:28,239
crying and begging,

302
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:30,850
but only you,

303
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:32,039
a stranger,

304
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:32,959
were willing to get me a doctor.

305
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:37,959
Afterward, no one wanted to admit their mistake.

306
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,359
Everyone crying so realistically.

307
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,079
Afterwards,

308
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,359
they all are still one harmonious family

309
00:16:46,359 --> 00:16:47,399
enjoying the happiness of having a family.

310
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,316
I can only put my safety

311
00:16:49,316 --> 00:16:50,199
before the matter of principles.

312
00:16:53,239 --> 00:16:54,917
Every day, pretending to be

313
00:16:54,917 --> 00:16:56,359
well-behaved and quiet.

314
00:16:57,479 --> 00:16:58,359
It's also thanks to

315
00:16:58,359 --> 00:17:00,119
my grandmother's pity

316
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,519
and meticulously raising me.

317
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,359
Or else,

318
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:05,079
I don't know how many times

319
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,039
I would have been dead by now.

320
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,479
Second Uncle,

321
00:17:15,479 --> 00:17:16,879
the words I told you today

322
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,839
are unfilial.

323
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:21,559
If not because

324
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,759
you are my savior,

325
00:17:23,479 --> 00:17:24,239
I wouldn't ever

326
00:17:24,239 --> 00:17:25,079
speak these words to you.

327
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:28,799
Second Uncle Gu,

328
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:31,559
it's not easy for women

329
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:32,639
to live in this world.

330
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:34,719
It's better that you

331
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,759
think about Rong'er's future more.

332
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:40,279
You are very similar to your mother.

333
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:41,239
You have great foresight.

334
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,079
I dare not say so.

335
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:46,119
I just have stayed

336
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:48,799
under dangerous eaves for a long time.

337
00:17:49,899 --> 00:17:51,759
It can't be helped for me to learn how to

338
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:52,719
be observant and to overthink.

339
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,119
Try to pave myself some paths of retreat.

340
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:58,879
With you having such good foresight,

341
00:18:00,239 --> 00:18:01,519
how come you're unable to figure out

342
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:02,399
your own matter?

343
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:05,759
My matter? What matter?

344
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:07,959
Marriage.

345
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:09,639
Stop with your nonsense.

346
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,359
With you being this smart,

347
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:16,399
no need for me to say more.

348
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,239
Anyway, think about it more.

349
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,359
Save yourself a path of retreat for the future.

350
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:35,759
Have a safe trip!

351
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:37,079
Farewell! Farewell!

352
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:38,799
Have a safe trip! Be careful!

353
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,239
Safe travels!

354
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:41,079
Farewell!

355
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:41,959
Farewell!

356
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:43,879
Take care!

357
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:45,439
Take care!

358
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,799
Be careful on your journey, Miss!

359
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:48,999
Take care!

360
00:18:56,159 --> 00:18:57,279
Farewell!

361
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:06,519
Let's go to Yuzhou and look for the Tuanlian Zhao.

362
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,239
Ask for a recommendation.

363
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,316
We'll join the army.

364
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:49,639
Be careful. Be careful.

365
00:19:51,879 --> 00:19:53,479
You had a difficult journey...

366
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,559
Good. Good.

367
00:19:59,719 --> 00:20:00,639
You're home at last.

368
00:20:00,719 --> 00:20:01,719
That's right.

369
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:09,919
Slow down. Slow down.

370
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:13,959
Sister-in-law!

371
00:20:15,879 --> 00:20:17,119
I missed you!

372
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:19,639
First House Old Madam, hello.

373
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:20,639
Hello.

374
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:22,999
It's all my fault.

375
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:24,319
Always pestering you to come.

376
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:26,879
Never thought that the travel isn't that safe.

377
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:29,759
Causing you to almost get harmed.

378
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:33,399
Good thing, you didn't catch a cold and get sick.

379
00:20:34,439 --> 00:20:36,119
Don't say it anymore, Sister-in-law.

380
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,199
I've long wanted to come see you.

381
00:20:40,399 --> 00:20:42,879
Moreover, so what if I get sick?

382
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:45,919
Isn't Sister He here

383
00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:47,959
to attend our family's wedding?

384
00:20:48,879 --> 00:20:50,279
Look at your mouth.

385
00:20:50,439 --> 00:20:51,679
Thinking about me again.

386
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:52,719
Of course.

387
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:56,439
On our way here,

388
00:20:56,439 --> 00:20:57,999
it's all thanks to my granddaughter.

389
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,999
So smart,

390
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,599
capable,

391
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:02,719
and filial.

392
00:21:03,719 --> 00:21:05,156
She protected me to escape

393
00:21:05,156 --> 00:21:06,439
that dangerous situation,

394
00:21:06,879 --> 00:21:08,399
hence, I was able to come here.

395
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,359
Quickly come over to let me see.

396
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:13,079
Come.

397
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,439
Really good.

398
00:21:16,439 --> 00:21:18,239
Did you get traumatized?

399
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,759
I'm fine.

400
00:21:20,399 --> 00:21:21,639
That experience will just

401
00:21:21,639 --> 00:21:22,959
become a happy joke

402
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:24,399
between my sisters and I.

403
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,159
That's great. Quickly sit down.

404
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,879
Look at that.

405
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,159
She's really a child raised by

406
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:32,599
the only daughter of Marquis of Yongyi.

407
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:36,439
Talking about sisters,

408
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,119
I have two granddaughters.

409
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,279
The eldest is called Shulan.

410
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:41,799
She's been married off a few years ago.

411
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:43,959
She'll be back

412
00:21:43,959 --> 00:21:46,119
after two months

413
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,039
during the Mid-Autumn Festival.

414
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:49,239
The younger one is called Pinlan.

415
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:51,399
She's almost the same age as you.

416
00:21:51,879 --> 00:21:54,119
A very naive and naughty monkey.

417
00:21:57,639 --> 00:21:59,439
She can be your

418
00:21:59,439 --> 00:22:00,359
companion and playmate.

419
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:01,519
Grandmother,

420
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:02,919
what do you want me to play ?

421
00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:05,719
The naughty monkey is here.

422
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,719
Grandmother, wishing you good health.

423
00:22:09,199 --> 00:22:10,018
Second House Grandmother,

424
00:22:10,018 --> 00:22:10,959
wishing you benevolent health.

425
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,719
Sister Pinlan, hello.

426
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:13,959
Sister Minglan,

427
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:14,959
I wish you good health!

428
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:16,999
Mother, wishing you virtuous health.

429
00:22:17,639 --> 00:22:19,039
Why are you meeting the guests

430
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,159
dressed like that?

431
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:24,239
My daughter

432
00:22:24,879 --> 00:22:25,719
loves to practice calligraphy.

433
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:27,439
Look at you.

434
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:28,477
I know you're afraid

435
00:22:28,477 --> 00:22:30,079
that the ink might dirty your clothes.

436
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:31,599
But when you were called,

437
00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:33,159
you should have fixed

438
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:34,159
your clothes before coming out.

439
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,759
Mother, what practicing calligraphy?

440
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:37,439
Grandmother said

441
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:38,839
I can play

442
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:40,079
some chuiwan in the afternoon.

443
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:41,159
You...

444
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:43,679
I'm unable

445
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:44,919
to stop her.

446
00:22:45,849 --> 00:22:47,159
Quickly put down your sleeves.

447
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:48,039
You might catch a cold!

448
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:51,319
Sister-in-law, don't blame me.

449
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:53,239
I dote on granddaughters more.

450
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:54,679
I'm thinking,

451
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:56,439
Youyang is

452
00:22:56,439 --> 00:22:58,479
in the countryside.

453
00:22:58,679 --> 00:22:59,794
The rules here aren't as strict

454
00:22:59,794 --> 00:23:00,679
as those in the capital.

455
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:02,150
She'll just be staying here

456
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,279
in our house for a few years.

457
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:05,319
Once she's out of our house and is married off,

458
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,559
she won't be able to be like a lady anymore.

459
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:09,439
Right.

460
00:23:10,399 --> 00:23:11,799
Ming'er is also

461
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:13,039
very restricted at home.

462
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:15,039
Hence,

463
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,879
I brought her this time

464
00:23:16,879 --> 00:23:18,559
so she can relax.

465
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,559
That's good.

466
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:21,818
This is called,

467
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:23,679
"a single string can't make a thread,

468
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,799
a single tree can't form a forest".

469
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,959
You have found a companion.

470
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,919
Don't be a bad influence to Ming.

471
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,719
How could I?

472
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:37,639
Oh, right,

473
00:23:37,639 --> 00:23:39,199
when you are going out,

474
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:41,799
if Changwu isn't doing anything,

475
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:43,959
bring my eldest son too.

476
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:46,159
Call some male servants to accompany you.

477
00:23:46,719 --> 00:23:48,679
It's not that safe outside right now.

478
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,879
I heard that there are bandits wreaking havoc.

479
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,039
You mustn't come back late.

480
00:23:53,879 --> 00:23:55,039
Grandmother, don't worry.

481
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:05,959
Miss!

482
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:07,839
Miss, it's time to wake up.

483
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:14,719
Wake up, Miss.

484
00:24:18,199 --> 00:24:19,439
Miss, wake up.

485
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:21,119
Hurry. Hurry.

486
00:24:22,639 --> 00:24:23,559
Sister!

487
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:25,679
Still sleeping?

488
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:27,319
It's time to wake up, sister!

489
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:30,439
The sun is already shining on your buttocks.

490
00:24:30,959 --> 00:24:31,959
It's shining on your big butt.

491
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,039
Get up.

492
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:37,839
Are you getting up or not?

493
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:39,239
Give that to me!

494
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:40,319
Sister! Sister!

495
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:40,919
Slow down.

496
00:24:41,199 --> 00:24:42,279
Wash your face and I'll give it to you.

497
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:44,519
Give it to me. I'll wash my face.

498
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:45,759
Okay. Okay. I'm washing.

499
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:48,599
I've dug out a lair full of rabbits.

500
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:49,239
It's so much fun!

501
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:50,279
Quickly wash your face

502
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:51,119
and I'll take you to see it.

503
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:55,559
Wash.

504
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:35,079
Okay. Go to the Drought Squad.

505
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:40,119
What is that?

506
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:45,630
Heaven, earth, black, yellow,

507
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,319
universe,time, flood, drought.

508
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:47,839
It's the last squad.

509
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:49,999
Our Young Master

510
00:25:56,199 --> 00:25:57,519
We'll follow the rules.

511
00:25:58,399 --> 00:26:00,559
Okay. Go now.

512
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,639
General, he was recommended by Commander Zhao.

513
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:15,844
I think it's not good to send him

514
00:26:15,844 --> 00:26:16,466
to the Drought Squad.

515
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:23,779
Commander Zhao Zongquan

516
00:26:23,779 --> 00:26:25,319
of the Yuzhou Tuanlian.

517
00:26:26,639 --> 00:26:27,839
How prestigious is he?

518
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:30,484
There are Imperial family members

519
00:26:30,484 --> 00:26:31,668
who have lost favor all over the empire.

520
00:26:32,809 --> 00:26:34,599
He really thinks he's some noble royal relative?

521
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:36,839
A man claiming to hold a command token

522
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:38,039
when he's only holding a chicken feather.

523
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:39,799
Letting him go to the Drought Squad

524
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,159
is already giving that official respect!

525
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:02,159
Hurry. Can you see it?

526
00:27:04,439 --> 00:27:05,279
Look at me.

527
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:11,159
Hurry. Hurry.

528
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:19,239
Brother Changwu is so great!

529
00:27:19,439 --> 00:27:20,359
I've never gone hunting.

530
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:21,399
I can't even shoot an arrow.

531
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:23,479
It's fine.

532
00:27:23,639 --> 00:27:24,719
Just hold that rabbit

533
00:27:24,719 --> 00:27:25,439
that Brother Changwu hit.

534
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:27,639
Thank you, Sister Pinlan.

535
00:27:27,639 --> 00:27:28,719
You’re so welcome.

536
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,759
Brother Changwu!

537
00:27:31,639 --> 00:27:33,239
Hunt more rabbits!

538
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:34,439
Or else,

539
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,799
I won't allow you to consummate your marriage

540
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:36,799
with your new wife in a few months!

541
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:40,479
You stinky brat, always talking rubbish.

542
00:27:40,479 --> 00:27:41,359
No shame at all!

543
00:27:47,879 --> 00:27:49,119
Have you seen He Hongwen?

544
00:27:49,439 --> 00:27:50,479
Didn't he say that he'll protect us

545
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:51,399
with Brother Changwu earlier?

546
00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:52,799
Now, really good, can't even see his shadow.

547
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:53,679
Later, he might even

548
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:54,919
get captured by a tiger!

549
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,559
Brother Hongwen.

550
00:28:25,999 --> 00:28:27,239
It's all my fault.

551
00:28:27,879 --> 00:28:28,879
I'm supposed to

552
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:29,919
protect you on this trip.

553
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:31,959
But when I passed by this place,

554
00:28:32,719 --> 00:28:34,199
I discovered "white dragon's bark"

555
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:35,719
and was carried away.

556
00:28:36,879 --> 00:28:37,879
I've embarrassed myself.

557
00:28:40,479 --> 00:28:41,559
People go out to hunt for

558
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:42,919
wild rabbits or chickens.

559
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:44,839
You instead go out to dig some herbs.

560
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:46,199
Then when you go back

561
00:28:46,199 --> 00:28:47,679
and people ask what prey you captured,

562
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:48,759
how do you explain it?

563
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,879
I'll tell them that I can't endure hurting animals

564
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:53,199
and was too benevolent.

565
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,185
Medical practitioners really

566
00:28:56,185 --> 00:28:57,519
have a heart like a Bodhisattva.

567
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,479
Can you see that?! Another chicken!

568
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:03,679
Let's go. Let's go.

569
00:29:07,439 --> 00:29:08,199
Is there a peasant

570
00:29:08,199 --> 00:29:09,359
household up ahead?

571
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:11,359
We can go over there to drink some water

572
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:12,559
and rest for a while.

573
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,359
Don't. Let's...

574
00:29:14,479 --> 00:29:15,759
Let's go to Second Sister Zhang's house

575
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:16,519
to play some jiju.

576
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:17,599
They might have not finished the game yet.

577
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:19,759
You're not tired?

578
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:21,439
I'm not.

579
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,319
Let's go drink some water first.

580
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:24,159
Everyone is tired.

581
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:26,959
I notice that

582
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:28,279
you keep defending Sixth Sister.

583
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:29,359
I'm not.

584
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:30,500
Stay down.

585
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:34,999
Stay down. Stay down.

586
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:36,225
What's going on?

587
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:37,359
Those are bandits.

588
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:38,839
Stay down.

589
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:46,719
What's going on?

590
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:48,910
These past few months,

591
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:49,999
there's this huge rebel in the south.

592
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:51,559
First he wanted to establish his own empire.

593
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,719
Afterwards, he decided to surrender to our empire.

594
00:29:54,069 --> 00:29:55,399
Then I don't know why, but he revolted again.

595
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,759
Thus these bandits started appearing.

596
00:29:57,239 --> 00:29:57,999
Those water pirates

597
00:29:57,999 --> 00:29:59,119
that you've encountered last time.

598
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:00,639
must be

599
00:30:00,639 --> 00:30:01,959
colluding with them.

600
00:30:02,959 --> 00:30:04,279
Then...they've now

601
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:05,359
attacked this area?

602
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:09,839
Only seven or eight of them.

603
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:11,679
They probably didn't attack.

604
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:13,719
They probably escaped here after getting defeated.

605
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:15,199
A few days ago,

606
00:30:15,199 --> 00:30:16,279
I've even seen an announcement in the city.

607
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:22,279
Let's quickly go back.

608
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,959
Let's go back and tell the local magistrate

609
00:30:25,205 --> 00:30:26,519
and ask them to intensify their patrol.

610
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,199
Why are you being afraid?

611
00:30:28,199 --> 00:30:29,119
There are so many of us.

612
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,239
Let's just directly capture them.

613
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:30,999
Nonsense.

614
00:30:31,719 --> 00:30:33,119
They are used to killing people

615
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:33,959
and fighting battles.

616
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:35,599
Our servants only know to do house chores.

617
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:36,359
How will we be able to fight them?

618
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,159
Quickly go. Quickly go.

619
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,519
How come I feel like we can beat them?

620
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,759
Seriously, let's just go!

621
00:31:02,199 --> 00:31:03,639
Go and check the corpses.

622
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,079
Go and search other places.

623
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:08,650
Look.

624
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:11,599
What a rotten general.

625
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:14,719
Asking me to dig a pit to bury people.

626
00:31:14,719 --> 00:31:15,159
Look.

627
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:18,479
Scholars said

628
00:31:19,439 --> 00:31:20,230
when the heavens wants to

629
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,092
bestow a great duty unto you,

630
00:31:23,092 --> 00:31:24,283
they will first tire your heart

631
00:31:24,283 --> 00:31:25,399
and make your muscles suffer.

632
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:26,719
Right. Right.

633
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:30,359
General, you quoted it in error.

634
00:31:30,719 --> 00:31:32,091
It's make your heart suffer

635
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:33,199
and tire your muscles.

636
00:31:35,239 --> 00:31:36,279
I said it wrong.

637
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:41,039
Young Master,

638
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,479
we came with a recommendation.

639
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:43,839
That Xie Pingde is

640
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:45,279
just a fifth-rank Mobile Cavalry General.

641
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:46,731
He actually is asking us to dig a pit here

642
00:31:46,731 --> 00:31:47,119
to bury people?

643
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:52,119
I now feel that

644
00:31:52,719 --> 00:31:54,119
asking Brother Zhao for a recommendation

645
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:54,959
might have been the wrong move.

646
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:55,959
Why?

647
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:00,879
They are the descendants of Taizong.

648
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,559
Maybe they are not well-liked.

649
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:09,839
Tu'er!

650
00:32:10,959 --> 00:32:13,119
Give me back the hair pin!

651
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:22,907
You're seeking vengeance for a private grudge

652
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:23,279
using your official position.

653
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:26,039
Enough. Enough. Stop fighting.

654
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,519
This is Li San's hairpin.

655
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,999
His child lost a father!

656
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:32,079
I'm taking it back

657
00:32:32,959 --> 00:32:34,199
as a remembrance for his family.

658
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:41,399
Official. Official.

659
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:41,959
Okay.

660
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:43,839
Lower the carriage.

661
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:10,559
Hope the Moon Goddess can bless us

662
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,279
with a face like Chang'e,

663
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:14,039
that's round like the bright moon.

664
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:23,119
Miss,

665
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:24,119
Big Madam

666
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:25,359
asked you to meet guests in the side hall

667
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:26,919
after you're done bowing to the moon.

668
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:31,119
Let's go. Let's go.

669
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,399
Let's bring a rabbit lantern.

670
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,119
Sure.

671
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:40,399
Treat it as comforting ourselves.

672
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:46,559
This is for you.

673
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:55,399
Is it pretty?

674
00:33:58,359 --> 00:33:59,719
Mid-Autumn is really a good festival.

675
00:33:59,719 --> 00:34:00,719
I love playing with lanterns.

676
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:02,959
But there's some relatives

677
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:03,959
that I don't like seeing.

678
00:34:05,199 --> 00:34:07,159
They are the in-laws of my sister Shulan.

679
00:34:07,719 --> 00:34:09,119
But to see Eldest Sister,

680
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,039
I have to see them.

681
00:34:10,759 --> 00:34:11,879
I've been here for a few days.

682
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,679
How come I have never

683
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,879
saw her visit?

684
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:17,479
That in-law's son is a Xiucai!

685
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:18,279
How could she

686
00:34:18,319 --> 00:34:19,999
put any importance to our family?

687
00:34:21,479 --> 00:34:22,479
You can't say that.

688
00:34:22,799 --> 00:34:23,879
If they look down on our family,

689
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,479
why would they marry someone from us?

690
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,999
They were very poor before.

691
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:31,399
It's also not good for me to

692
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:32,399
speak ill about them behind their backs.

693
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,959
Anyway, just go there later.

694
00:34:34,319 --> 00:34:35,559
You'll know once you see them.

695
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:36,999
I'm not falsely accusing them of anything.

696
00:34:39,479 --> 00:34:41,239
My son is a Xiucai!

697
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:45,639
Xiucai! Do you know what that is?

698
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:50,519
That's the start of a Counselor-in-Chief.

699
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:53,879
Once he becomes the Counselor-in-Chief...

700
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:54,759
What did I say?

701
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,119
She won't stop.

702
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,039
Aren't my nephew and your Ming

703
00:34:59,959 --> 00:35:02,599
exactly the perfect combination,

704
00:35:02,759 --> 00:35:04,359
very compatible?

705
00:35:07,879 --> 00:35:10,039
Mother-in-law, drink some tea first.

706
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:36,199
Is this Ming Girl,

707
00:35:36,959 --> 00:35:37,879
the one from Bianjing?

708
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:40,839
You're indeed pretty.

709
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:42,679
She was nourished well.

710
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:45,079
In-law! In-law!

711
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:46,319
You also have seen my nephew,

712
00:35:46,319 --> 00:35:47,519
right?

713
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:49,159
He's indeed handsome and talented, right?

714
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:54,519
Is Changwu also

715
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,239
getting married soon?

716
00:35:56,919 --> 00:35:58,359
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

717
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:01,999
It's also festive to pray to the Moon Goddess.

718
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,799
Why don't we add the joyous occasion?

719
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:05,627
Let's settle the marriage.

720
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:07,067
about my nephew and Ming...

721
00:36:08,359 --> 00:36:09,039
Settle...

722
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:12,559
Let's

723
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:13,839
settle the marriage

724
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:15,119
about my nephew and Ming.

725
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,159
In-law is drunk.

726
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:18,599
Shulan,

727
00:36:18,879 --> 00:36:21,719
quickly assist your mother-in-law to rest.

728
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:24,399
What do you mean, rest?

729
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:28,399
Although I've drunk a little wine,

730
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:30,519
I'm not drunk.

731
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:35,599
Sister-in-law...Old Madam,

732
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,079
you seem unwilling?

733
00:36:39,799 --> 00:36:41,479
But this isn't your granddaughter.

734
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:43,639
We had better just ask

735
00:36:43,999 --> 00:36:45,359
her real grandmother.

736
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:49,199
My granddaughter is still young.

737
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:52,279
I'm going to make her stay by my side first.

738
00:36:52,799 --> 00:36:54,599
Let's just wait for a few more years.

739
00:36:57,879 --> 00:36:58,919
I just like how good

740
00:36:58,919 --> 00:37:00,279
the complexion is of this lady,

741
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:01,599
perfect for giving birth.

742
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:06,054
Although she's just an illegitimate daughter

743
00:37:06,054 --> 00:37:07,199
and thus a little incompatible,

744
00:37:08,319 --> 00:37:09,679
if it's I who say it,

745
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,679
that nephew of mine

746
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:12,999
won't dare refuse it.

747
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:16,759
If my in-law really thinks that

748
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:18,479
your granddaughter is still too young,

749
00:37:18,479 --> 00:37:19,439
it's fine too.

750
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:21,039
Let's first make the marriage agreement.

751
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,519
I'll put in some chamber attendants

752
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:25,079
with my nephew first

753
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:26,839
so he'll be more knowledgeable.

754
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:29,279
Once your granddaughter is older,

755
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:30,919
we can do the wedding then.

756
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,119
That nephew of yours

757
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:33,239
is already twenty-plus years old!

758
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:34,399
A nameless person

759
00:37:34,399 --> 00:37:35,599
without any farmland,

760
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:36,559
and he dares to come here to seek marriage?

761
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:38,319
Are the ladies

762
00:37:38,319 --> 00:37:39,079
of our Sheng family born to

763
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:40,239
fill in the pits of your Sun family?

764
00:37:42,399 --> 00:37:43,119
You unruly girl!

765
00:37:43,959 --> 00:37:45,279
Why do you talk to your elder like that?

766
00:37:47,319 --> 00:37:48,479
My son became

767
00:37:48,479 --> 00:37:50,279
a Xiucai at the age of twelve!

768
00:37:51,279 --> 00:37:52,959
The fortune teller already said

769
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:55,079
that he has a fate of

770
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,239
being a Counselor-in-Chief!

771
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:01,559
By then, he surely will be able to

772
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:03,239
promote his cousin.

773
00:38:04,959 --> 00:38:05,999
For you being this snobbish,

774
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:07,839
you might not even be able to

775
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,319
make any connections with us.

776
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,199
A Xiucai at age twelve.

777
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,359
But after a decade, he's still a xiucai?

778
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:19,359
My little sister's legitimate older brother

779
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:20,439
has already passed the top civil examination.

780
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,879
He's now an official in the Hanlin Academy.

781
00:38:23,999 --> 00:38:25,159
You think your family is still compatible to theirs?

782
00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:26,919
Spit!

783
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,319
Pinlan.

784
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:31,319
It's all the fault

785
00:38:31,319 --> 00:38:32,879
of this seductress from your family!

786
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,599
Since she married into our family,

787
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,199
my son lost focus on studying

788
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:39,479
and just fooled around!

789
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:41,425
No.

790
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:43,919
It's not me.

791
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:49,279
As your mother-in-law,

792
00:38:49,279 --> 00:38:50,399
I've been talking here for half a day now.

793
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:52,999
My mouth is dry.

794
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,119
You don't even know

795
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:57,559
to serve me any tea.

796
00:38:58,479 --> 00:38:59,759
What's the use of having you?

797
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,759
Why! Why!

798
00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:24,999
My sister dotes on me so much.

799
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:27,719
And she's such a nice person. How come . . .

800
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:29,479
How come she has to be met with this?

801
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:31,919
She's only twenty-something

802
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,079
and she still has to

803
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,400
live in that filthy,

804
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:35,919
brutish family for decades!

805
00:39:36,319 --> 00:39:37,359
Tell me,

806
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,239
what should she do from now on?

807
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:44,759
Young Master,

808
00:39:44,759 --> 00:39:45,719
I went to take a look.

809
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:47,079
They were there yesterday

810
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:48,399
but not today,

811
00:39:48,399 --> 00:39:49,119
and the stuff is still there.

812
00:39:54,879 --> 00:39:55,639
It's not right.

813
00:39:57,319 --> 00:39:58,234
This place is supposed to have

814
00:39:58,234 --> 00:39:59,119
lots of owls and wild wolves.

815
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:02,119
This should be their hunting time,

816
00:40:02,399 --> 00:40:03,559
but how come there's no movement at all?

817
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,439
Yes, it's very quiet.

818
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:09,639
They are going to mount a sneak attack!

819
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,799
General. General?

820
00:40:17,799 --> 00:40:18,719
General!

821
00:40:21,399 --> 00:40:22,119
General,

822
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:22,910
someone below says

823
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:24,079
there's big military intelligence,

824
00:40:24,279 --> 00:40:25,359
and he must meet you to report.

825
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:26,919
The renegade is coming?

826
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:29,319
It's that Bai Ye

827
00:40:29,319 --> 00:40:30,599
recommended by Commander Zhao.

828
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:31,639
He says it's a very big matter.

829
00:40:33,759 --> 00:40:34,399
Let me tell you.

830
00:40:34,879 --> 00:40:35,799
Come here.

831
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:38,199
Listen carefully here.

832
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,959
As long as it's not the renegades

833
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:40,759
attacking outside of our camp,

834
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:42,119
and the sky hasn't collapsed,

835
00:40:42,279 --> 00:40:43,519
then don't come disturb my sleep.

836
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:45,519
Yes.

837
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:51,559
General. General,

838
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,912
tonight the enemy force will launch

839
00:40:52,912 --> 00:40:54,159
a sneak-attack on our main camp!

840
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:55,679
One o'clock to three o'clock

841
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:56,879
is when people are sleeping most soundly.

842
00:40:57,039 --> 00:40:58,239
It's already past one o'clock

843
00:40:58,239 --> 00:40:59,879
so the enemies will be attacking very soon!

844
00:41:04,919 --> 00:41:05,999
You know it's the most sound asleep time

845
00:41:05,999 --> 00:41:06,839
and you came disturb me?

846
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:08,199
Go, go on!

847
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:09,799
General.

848
00:41:09,959 --> 00:41:11,919
Men! Shove him out!

849
00:41:12,399 --> 00:41:13,639
General, may your anger dissipate.

850
00:41:13,799 --> 00:41:15,719
No, General.

851
00:41:15,759 --> 00:41:17,879
Go. General, we're on a plain!

852
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:19,039
If they attack,

853
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:19,759
If they attack,

854
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,559
we will not survive it!

855
00:41:21,759 --> 00:41:22,759
General, may your anger dissipate.

856
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:24,199
General!

857
00:41:24,439 --> 00:41:27,839
General! General! General!

858
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:29,319
Enough.

859
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:31,599
They might not raid here tonight.

860
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,279
Maybe you heard it wrong.

861
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:37,559
Then what are we supposed to do?

862
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:38,679
Send some cavalry

863
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:39,719
and scout around?

864
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,159
If you would like that, you lead it!

865
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,159
Young Master. Young Master. How did it go?

866
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:56,559
You go

867
00:41:57,399 --> 00:41:59,359
and tell everyone to

868
00:41:59,479 --> 00:42:00,719
wake up every friend

869
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:01,719
and fellow villager they know.

870
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:02,799
Tell them

871
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,559
the enemy force is coming

872
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:04,359
to raid here imminently.

873
00:42:04,999 --> 00:42:06,039
Tell them to

874
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,199
put their weapons by their hand.

875
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:09,359
Hurry and go.

876
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:10,199
The more people they tell the better.

877
00:42:10,999 --> 00:42:12,559
Young Master, it's the middle of the night

878
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:13,479
and no one wants to get up.

879
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:14,919
And if they ask other soldiers,

880
00:42:14,919 --> 00:42:15,759
wouldn't they know we're lying?

881
00:42:15,759 --> 00:42:16,959
And if they ask other soldiers, wouldn't they know we're lying?

882
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:20,199
Tell them it's the General's idea.

883
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,199
That the General wants to take this chance,

884
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:24,399
to annihilate the enemy force at once here.

885
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:27,039
Yes. Sending

886
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:28,439
false military orders results in beheading.

887
00:42:31,319 --> 00:42:32,439
You'll know

888
00:42:32,439 --> 00:42:33,025
if I'm sending a false command

889
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:34,359
once the enemies come and kill.

890
00:42:34,999 --> 00:42:35,959
Hurry up and go.

891
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:37,679
Hurry.

892
00:42:42,399 --> 00:42:43,559
Young Master, I'll go too.

893
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:45,079
Shitou.

894
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:47,239
Young Master.

895
00:42:52,399 --> 00:42:53,279
Tell me.

896
00:42:54,799 --> 00:42:56,279
My father back then.

897
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,319
Did he live

898
00:42:57,319 --> 00:42:58,199
this kind of life too?

899
00:43:00,959 --> 00:43:01,919
Why would the old Marquis

900
00:43:01,919 --> 00:43:02,879
live this kind of life?

901
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,639
The old Marquis inherited the title.

902
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:10,279
That's true.

903
00:43:11,879 --> 00:43:12,475
Alright.

904
00:43:12,919 --> 00:43:14,319
You hurry and tell

905
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:15,359
everyone to be careful.

906
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:16,759
Yes, I'll go.

907
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:17,359
Come back.

908
00:43:20,279 --> 00:43:20,999
Go.

909
00:43:21,439 --> 00:43:22,079
I'm going, Young Master.
