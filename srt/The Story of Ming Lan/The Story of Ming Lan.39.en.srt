00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,175
The Story of Minglan

2
00:00:59,175 --> 00:01:01,675
Episode 39

3
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,920
Are you not afraid that

4
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,680
I'll endure Cao Jinxiu and agree to that marriage?

5
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,125
I'm not a person

6
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:16,800
who is okay with anything.

7
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,200
The same goes for you.

8
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,440
Although you look obedient

9
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,520
and can adapt easily,

10
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,400
you are actually very stubborn.

11
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,320
Hence,

12
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,840
I used Cao family

13
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,680
because I'm far away on the borders

14
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,840
and can't empty my hands to handle it.

15
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,040
It's enough to just delay you for a while.

16
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,850
Moreover, even if your family agrees to

17
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:38,640
accept such a proposal,

18
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,080
I still have my ways.

19
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,400
Stop bragging.

20
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,760
without Wen Yanjing,

21
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,320
would you have made it?

22
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,600
I'm determined to have you.

23
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,920
The heavens pitied me

24
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,040
and sent Wen Yanjing to help me.

25
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,080
That is because the heavens hate evil people!

26
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,080
Well, whatever you say.

27
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,880
Also, when I knew that your elder sister

28
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,520
was dating Wen Yanjing secretly,

29
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,520
I was so happy that

30
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,240
I wasn't able to fall asleep again all night!

31
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,080
Really.

32
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,440
I feel that

33
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,760
I've never exerted so much

34
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,920
thought even in wars compared to this.

35
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,900
This is called making a sound

36
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,040
in the east to attack the west.

37
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,800
I Just want to marry a wife,

38
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,320
I've even used my knowledge in military tactics.

39
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,320
You are talking about

40
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,760
this matter too lightly.

41
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,100
That was the reputation of my Fifth Sister,

42
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,120
and the dignity of

43
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,040
my whole Sheng Family.

44
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,280
What if something bad happens,

45
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,400
it would all be over!

46
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,520
That's why

47
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,560
I sent men to investigate the family background

48
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,520
and character of Wen Yanjing.

49
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,840
If he had a bad reputation,

50
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,320
since he could be your future brother-in-law

51
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,440
which is also mine.

52
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,560
I would then hire some people

53
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,280
to expel him out of the capital,

54
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,680
so that he won't mess up your Sheng Family

55
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,240
and destroy your reputation!

56
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,760
You...

57
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,760
You cast such a huge net.

58
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,240
Not only that.

59
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,550
Your father and his wife,

60
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,640
and your Sister Rulan's temper and personalities

61
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,280
have already been clearly understood by me

62
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,640
thanks to your Second Brother Changbai.

63
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,440
Your father

64
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,825
loves his clean reputation

65
00:03:18,825 --> 00:03:20,040
more than his wife and children.

66
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,480
His wife is muddled and short-sighted.

67
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,160
Your Sister Rulan

68
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,680
is simple, infatuated, open, and candid.

69
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,280
Also,

70
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,925
I was sure that your Brother Changbai

71
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,080
won't turn hostile against me

72
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,080
even if he learns about this matter,

73
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,960
so I boldly implemented it.

74
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,080
Everything,

75
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,075
even if the timing, place, and people

76
00:03:38,075 --> 00:03:38,760
are all perfect,

77
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,960
it won't work even without luck.

78
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,360
I'm not done talking yet!

79
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,280
What do you treat me as?

80
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,520
A wild pig in a trap,

81
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,800
or a herring in a fish net?

82
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,080
Gu Tingye,

83
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,080
you're a ruffian, a scoundrel!

84
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,400
My Young Master,

85
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,200
what did you say to Sixth Miss

86
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,480
making her so shocked like that.

87
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,000
Nothing.

88
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,360
I just expressed my sincerity.

89
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,200
But it seemed that

90
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,640
it was not the case.

91
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,840
Haven't you always said that

92
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,680
you will be very kind to her

93
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,110
How come that it didn't work today?

94
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,440
It didn't work?

95
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,360
It worked so perfectly!

96
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,975
The results of the civil examination

97
00:04:38,975 --> 00:04:39,760
will be announced today?

98
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,960
Right.

99
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,125
Have some rest.

100
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,560
We might need to

101
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,280
meet another person today.

102
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,800
Gu Tingye...

103
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,080
How is this possible?

104
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,480
It's true.

105
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,840
That Old Madam Sheng

106
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,920
also said the same thing.

107
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,040
Absolutely impossible!

108
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,800
Even if the Sheng Family

109
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,680
will marry off a daughter,

110
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,480
it would be Rulan!

111
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,160
That Big Madam Wang

112
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,520
won't allow an illegitimate daughter

113
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,920
to marry off into an marquis' house.

114
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,240
That Rulan has already been set to marry a scholar

115
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,360
who passed the Imperial examination.

116
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,040
He's a scholar promoted by the Sheng Family.

117
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,680
Gu Tingye

118
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,200
was a little bit late in proposing marriage,

119
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,280
so he settled with Minglan.

120
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,840
Son, this is fate.

121
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,400
He was late,

122
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,960
so were you.

123
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,400
Stop putting too much fuss on it.

124
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,040
Forget Minglan.

125
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,400
No.

126
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,280
This is not right.

127
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,960
This is totally wrong.

128
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,600
Yuanruo!

129
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,600
Yuanruo!

130
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,880
Don't go to the Sheng Manor and cause ruckus!

131
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,600
Yuanruo.

132
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,160
Second Uncle, you came so late.

133
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,920
You are really busy.

134
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,200
I heard you passed the civil examination.

135
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,440
This is something worth celebrating.

136
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,360
Congratulations.

137
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,550
Emmm...

138
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,520
Why are you unhappy?

139
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,880
Who angered you?

140
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,000
You clearly know that

141
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,690
I love Minglan.

142
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,640
Why did you still promise the Sheng Family that

143
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,200
you're going to marry her? What is your intention?

144
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,880
You're still thinking about her?

145
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,560
I didn't know that.

146
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,040
I only know that

147
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,075
after you lost your wife,

148
00:06:52,075 --> 00:06:54,000
you shut yourself up and focused on your studies.

149
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,900
You didn't inquire about

150
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,840
the matters happening outside.

151
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,120
I thought that you'd let it go.

152
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,560
You can't blame me for this

153
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,080
It is a strange combination of circumstances, right?

154
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,120
I heard of it.

155
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,480
The one you're supposed to marry

156
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,750
is the legitimate daughter of the Sheng Family.

157
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,120
But she was already set to marry someone else,

158
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,520
so you chose Minglan instead.

159
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,040
In your eyes,

160
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,720
she was just a substitute.

161
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,280
Let her go.

162
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,320
You were the first one to give her up.

163
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,240
I urged you back then

164
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,680
to not fear the power of Prince Yong.

165
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,480
If you had agreed,

166
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,360
I would have risked

167
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,200
my life to make you two

168
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,200
be together.

169
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,720
But what did you do?

170
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,960
You were being such a coward

171
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,640
and didn't dare to take the risk.

172
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,200
You gave her up,

173
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,020
so why are you blaming me now?

174
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,880
I didn't give her up!

175
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,025
I must pass the Imperial examination first

176
00:07:44,025 --> 00:07:44,520
to get a high rank

177
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,450
so I could have the diginity

178
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,680
to propose marriage to the Sheng Family.

179
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,400
However, I was late.

180
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,200
You want your dignity?

181
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,520
Does the Sixth Miss not need hers too?

182
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,000
Your matter with Minglan back then

183
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,040
was discussed widely throughout the capital.

184
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,560
Everyone here in the capital

185
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,840
knew it.

186
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,680
You could indeed not marry her

187
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,783
and marry a princess of the second rank.

188
00:08:04,325 --> 00:08:06,400
No one would talk against you.

189
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,440
But what happened to Minglan

190
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,175
who is just an illegitimate daughter

191
00:08:09,175 --> 00:08:09,760
of a lower-ranking official?

192
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,560
Didn't you know?

193
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,880
Moreover,

194
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,760
if you really wanted to marry Minglan,

195
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,280
if you had proposed marriage to

196
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,125
the Sheng Family immediately

197
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:18,840
after your wife's death,

198
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,320
you would have a chance.

199
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,240
But you didn't go.

200
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:23,225
You said that you had to wait

201
00:08:23,225 --> 00:08:24,120
to pass the civil examination.

202
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,480
If you didn't pass this year,

203
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,750
you were going to make her wait

204
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,320
for three more years?

205
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,600
Six more years?

206
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,200
Forever waiting like that,

207
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,440
waiting for you to have prestige

208
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,440
before you go to her family for proposal?

209
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,480
I didn't do it just to have prestige.

210
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,575
Last time,

211
00:08:39,575 --> 00:08:41,920
when our situation hadn't been finalized yet,

212
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,000
I had rushed to make her a promise.

213
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,680
In the end, I just broke my oath

214
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,600
and broke her heart.

215
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,160
So this time,

216
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,520
I must be 100% sure

217
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,200
before I go before her family to propose.

218
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,200
I...am also not blaming you.

219
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,880
I'm just saying that

220
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,950
if you had your predicament

221
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,200
and were thus unable to marry her,

222
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,050
then you shouldn't blame a late-comer like me

223
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:03,840
for surpassing you.

224
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,050
You are not taking no one but her

225
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:08,600
as your wife, right?

226
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,080
How do you know that I'm not?

227
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,640
So you have had an affection on her from early on.

228
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,640
Yuanruo, since our discussion

229
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,000
has reached this point,

230
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,760
I'll be honest with you.

231
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,120
In the past,

232
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,440
I saw you two having mutual affection

233
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,560
and loathing to part from each other.

234
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,040
I really wanted to support you two.

235
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,160
But afterward,

236
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,560
I saw you being unable to

237
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,175
keep your relationship going

238
00:09:46,175 --> 00:09:46,680
and disappointing her,

239
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,440
I then made up my mind

240
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,640
that once I returned with honor,

241
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,560
I surely will marry Minglan.

242
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,480
How sure are you that

243
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,120
she's willing to marry you?

244
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,440
Just in order to marry her,

245
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,920
I fought hard in the wars,

246
00:10:05,925 --> 00:10:07,550
charged into the front line, bled blood

247
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,280
and risked my life,

248
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,280
before I was able to

249
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,670
obtain today's honor.

250
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,760
If you can't accept it,

251
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,120
you can go ask her,

252
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,320
and ask the Old Madam in their house.

253
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,560
Okay.

254
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,525
Young Master,

255
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,040
how could you let the Young Lord

256
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,080
go and ask Sixth Miss?

257
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,200
She had more affection on Young Lord

258
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,480
than that on you.

259
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,160
The will of Sixth Miss Sheng

260
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,080
is very firm and clear.

261
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,560
Before, I was indeed very afraid that

262
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,960
she'd choose He Hongwen.

263
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,200
But I know that

264
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,120
no matter what happens,

265
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,680
she won't choose Young Lord Qi again.

266
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,560
Old Madam said that she's not feeling well.

267
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,840
the Young Lord, please just go back.

268
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,880
Then, I will come again next time.

269
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,240
Don't bother.

270
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,320
Why?

271
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,320
Old Madam said that you came today surely

272
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,080
to ask her to convince Sixth Miss.

273
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,025
Sixth Miss listens to Old Madam the most.

274
00:11:22,025 --> 00:11:22,040
She surely will not disobey her grandmother.

275
00:11:22,055 --> 00:11:23,720
She surely will not disobey her grandmother.

276
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,400
Old Madam

277
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,690
really knows everything.

278
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,000
Hence, Old Madam said that

279
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,080
you shouldn't waste your effort.

280
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,160
She still can remember

281
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,080
what you've done before.

282
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,250
Although the Sheng Family

283
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,200
isn't an aristocratic family

284
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,000
and Sixth Miss is just an illegitimate daughter,

285
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,340
we have some backbone.

286
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,450
We won't be rushing to someone

287
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,240
at their beck and call.

288
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,320
Won't we get laughed at if this gets out?

289
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,525
It's you who said that you wanted to marry her,

290
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,880
then you said you don't want her anymore.

291
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,280
Although the gates of the Sheng Manor is small,

292
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,040
we still put importance to our dignity.

293
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,640
Miss Xiaotao,

294
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,600
I beg you to let me in.

295
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,040
I will personally explain to Old Madam.

296
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,000
Young Lord, if you still don't go,

297
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,040
I will call for people to evict you out.

298
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,760
Currently, I'm still giving you some respect.

299
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,950
If you still don't leave,

300
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,040
then there will be none anymore.

301
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,580
I had no choice back then!

302
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,880
No choice?

303
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,520
The Sixth Miss repeatedly refused you,

304
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,800
but you didn't give up.

305
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,375
You clearly knew that

306
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,400
you couldn't decide for your marriage,

307
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,425
but you still teased her,

308
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,840
and now you're saying that you had no choice?

309
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,880
No matter where she went after that,

310
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,650
there were people laughing at Sixth Miss

311
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:38,200
for having wishful thinking,

312
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:38,840
do you know that?

313
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,840
Forget it.

314
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,000
The Sixth Miss will be married off soon.

315
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Just leave.

316
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,320
She...

317
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,160
Is she really willing to marry Gu Tingye?

318
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,240
I...

319
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,680
I just want her to live a good life in the future.

320
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,225
It's none of your business

321
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:12,840
whether she lives a good life or not.

322
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,160
you broke your promise anyway!

323
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,920
And you still have the nerve to ask,

324
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,960
if she's living well?

325
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,760
If you still don't leave...

326
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,040
Actually,

327
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,040
the Young Lord was quite pitiful, Miss.

328
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,920
Anyway,

329
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,775
Old Madam still hasn't agreed

330
00:14:30,775 --> 00:14:31,800
with the proposal of the Gu Family.

331
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,440
How about...

332
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,360
Danju,

333
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,280
never look back.

334
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,960
Second Brother, you're getting married?

335
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,760
It's a miss from the Sheng family.

336
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,920
This is a granted marriage by His Majesty.

337
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,840
Big Madam, stop secretly discussing my marriage

338
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,600
with other families.

339
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,160
This matter is already finalized.

340
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,720
No one can break it up!

341
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,080
How could I?

342
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,960
This is a

343
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,280
grand Imperial grace,

344
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:39,320
of course, I'm so happy.

345
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,440
When do you plan to do it,

346
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,600
so I

347
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,280
can start preparing.

348
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,640
We have few sevants in our manor.

349
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,500
we need to hire outsiders

350
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,680
to help us with the chores.

351
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,760
No need to trouble you for that, Big Madam.

352
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,920
My marriage

353
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,200
will be organized

354
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,200
by people from the palace.

355
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,760
Prince Huan is a close friend of mine.

356
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,880
He surely will send some people to help out.

357
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,840
By then,

358
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,200
Big Madam and Eldest Brother

359
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,920
just need to sit there, drink some wine,

360
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,760
and accept the bows of other people.

361
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,600
That's fine.

362
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,960
That's fine.

363
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,160
It's an Imperial grace after all.

364
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,440
Since

365
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,920
Big Madam doesn't have any objections,

366
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,480
there shouldn't be any problem

367
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,950
with Eldest Brother and Sister-in-law either,

368
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,480
You clearly

369
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,240
have made up your mind,

370
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,800
no need to ask us.

371
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,640
Pretentious display of

372
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,040
proper etiquette should still be done.

373
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,320
Or else, if this great talent of

374
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,040
our Gu Family got lost because of me,

375
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,280
won't it be too bad?

376
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,480
Okay.

377
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,760
I'll just go looking around the house.

378
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,160
I'll check if there are areas

379
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,240
that should be renovated

380
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,840
and let them record it.

381
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,640
We'll start the construction tomorrow.

382
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,240
You're going to have the house renovated?

383
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,320
Don't worry.

384
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,200
I won't use any money of the marquis' house.

385
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,320
I just feel that

386
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,920
aren't you making this

387
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,200
much too grand?

388
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,160
Even when your father got married

389
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,000
in his first marriage,

390
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,920
he didn't mobilize so many people to organize it.

391
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,280
I fear that you might end up with

392
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,040
a reputation of going beyond the usual.

393
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,440
Making it this grand

394
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,880
is His Majesty's intention.

395
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,960
He felt that I'm a meritorious general,

396
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,160
so I should be rewarded.

397
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,600
But I'm a military official.

398
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,400
I can't be conferred a much higher official rank.

399
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,725
He can only reward me more

400
00:17:46,725 --> 00:17:47,960
in terms of money and items.

401
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,640
At that time,

402
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,080
Prince Huan will surely come.

403
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,600
Perhaps even the Empress

404
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,920
will come to attend the wedding too.

405
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,880
If I don't do some renovations,

406
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,000
it seems unreasonable.

407
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,480
I'll take off then.

408
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,520
What does your second brother mean by that?

409
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,200
How could the Emperor allow him

410
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,840
to have a wedding that's beyond the norms?

411
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,640
He must be eyeing your noble title

412
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,160
and is trying to test you.

413
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,040
I really have no strength to think

414
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,880
or care about it.

415
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,920
Just let him torment himself if he wants.

416
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,400
I'm tired.

417
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,320
I'll take off now.

418
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,240
Later,

419
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,440
you also go there to measure.

420
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,200
Measure that area.

421
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,200
Come, let me see.

422
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,480
Make it tidier! Hang up that lantern!

423
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,520
This one...

424
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,840
Did you jot it all down?

425
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,080
We did! We did! Young Lord.

426
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,200
Was what Big Madam said true?

427
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:17,925
Second Brother plans

428
00:19:17,925 --> 00:19:18,800
to take away your noble title?

429
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:22,560
The two of us have no sons.

430
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,200
My noble title

431
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,040
will be his once I die, so why would he

432
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,480
want to take it away now?

433
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,800
The person who really wants to

434
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,720
steal my noble title away

435
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,800
is Big Madam!

436
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,920
She probably have been wishing for

437
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,840
my death since long ago.

438
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,440
While Old Second wasn't around,

439
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,050
she would have let her Third Son

440
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:44,840
inherit the title.

441
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,880
But isn't Second Brother back?

442
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,000
So what?

443
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,850
The jar got broken

444
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:56,400
while it still hasn't been taken way from the well yet.

445
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,520
A general can die on the battlefield.

446
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,675
When Second Brother goes out

447
00:20:02,675 --> 00:20:03,880
for expeditions in the future,

448
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,440
we can't be sure of his life.

449
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,960
If I still don't have any descendants soon,

450
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,280
it will then be very beneficial to that Big Madam

451
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,760
who is also my maternal aunt.

452
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,320
Just wait and see.

453
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,700
That Miss of the Sheng Family

454
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,000
who is marrying into our family

455
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,600
will suffer soon.

456
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,480
Later, you tell them

457
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,120
to hang them over there too.

458
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,600
Ok.

459
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,200
I want to hang some

460
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,960
huge lanterns over there.

461
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,560
Right. Right. Huge lanterns,

462
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,520
the red ones.

463
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,625
That Gu Tingye

464
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,000
is a monstrous spider!

465
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,730
He wove such a huge web!

466
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,600
He wanted me to have now way out

467
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,920
and just submit to his will.

468
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,000
When have I ever encountered

469
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,880
such a thing?

470
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,080
I was so scared that I rushed back home.

471
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,320
He really arranged it

472
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,040
so accurately and ruthlessly.

473
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,320
It's not that ruthless.

474
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,240
Although he's a bit ferocious,

475
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,640
his natural temperament is good.

476
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,040
At the Youyang River,

477
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,520
when the rebels caused trouble,

478
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,480
and during the palace siege,

479
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,840
that Gu Tingye

480
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,480
did save my life.

481
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,320
Afterwards,

482
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,280
he even considered my reputation

483
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,560
and didn't publicize it or ask for any reward.

484
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,960
He can be considered to be an upright gentleman.

485
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,400
So many things happened?

486
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,520
You never told them to me!

487
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,120
Those...

488
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,240
those successive incidents...

489
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,680
I-I...was afraid that you would scold me.

490
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,120
I didn't dare to tell you.

491
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,360
It's also not your fault.

492
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,560
That man

493
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,080
was too scheming.

494
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,320
Let me ask you,

495
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,480
when Gu Tingye

496
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,080
told everything to you,

497
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,480
what were you thinking?

498
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,400
At the beginning,

499
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,760
I was a bit happy.

500
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,280
There was actually someone

501
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,480
who exerted so much efforts to get me.

502
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,640
Afterwards, I felt...

503
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,360
I got mad as I thought more about it.

504
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,040
I so wanted to slap him in the face!

505
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,920
Then afterwards,

506
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,560
I got anxious.

507
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,040
Grandmother,

508
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,160
say， this person is too good.

509
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,760
What should I do in the future?

510
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,280
The trap is too huge.

511
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,075
If it is not because we are being forced

512
00:22:39,075 --> 00:22:40,240
by the current circumstances

513
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,400
with him swindling us like that,

514
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,360
we mustn't agree with him.

515
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,100
As they say,

516
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,000
serving the Emperor is like being with a tiger.

517
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,320
He racked his brains like that

518
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,160
just to marry me,

519
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,280
what if in the future he starts to spurn me,

520
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,080
what will he then

521
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,960
plan to do?

522
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,320
Also...

523
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,320
Also, he knows about everything that

524
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,600
happened between Qi Heng and I.

525
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,440
Won't that mean

526
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,400
my weakness is

527
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,800
in his hands?

528
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,960
Their Gu Family matters

529
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,280
are also so tangled up.

530
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,280
I am afraid that I won't be able to handle it.

531
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,440
As long as you're unwilling,

532
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,680
even if it is a granted marriage by the Emperor,

533
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,240
I won't hand you over.

534
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,880
Even Old Madam

535
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,560
has tried to convince her twice.

536
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,360
Minglan

537
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,560
just say no to it.

538
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,040
I think this matter...

539
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,640
will be a bit hard to push through.

540
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,840
Wait a few more days.

541
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,480
The Sixth Little Sister

542
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,200
is not some usual ladies.

543
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,800
I know her very well.

544
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,635
Don't see her only as being gentle,

545
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,880
submissive, modest,

546
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,120
and very filial,

547
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,960
but once she has made a decision,

548
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,800
she will never easily change it.

549
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,160
Continuing waiting

550
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,520
is also not a good idea.

551
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,720
Let's wait for two more days.

552
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,840
What evil plan are you up to now?

553
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,800
I'm telling you,

554
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,240
if you swindle me again

555
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,320
like you did last time,

556
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,800
I won't help you anymore!

557
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,640
My exerting this much effort

558
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,360
is also a form of sincerity.

559
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,200
In your family

560
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,000
lives a very smart Old Madam

561
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,920
who is very decisive, that's it?

562
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,520
If Sixth Sister won't agree,

563
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,520
whatever plans are made will be in vain.

564
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,960
The spring comes,

565
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,360
It is a good timing.

566
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,120
I'll go in front of Her Highness the Empress

567
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,360
and shamelessly beg her

568
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,320
to organize a polo match for me.

569
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,760
At that time,

570
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,125
I will invite all the women

571
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:09,360
of prestigious families,

572
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,760
including your Sheng Family.

573
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,360
You're even involving the Empress now?

574
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,920
The deities in heaven

575
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,800
can see my sincerity!

576
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,920
I feel that it might not work.

577
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,440
Look here,

578
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,640
you're using the Empress

579
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,880
to scare my sister,

580
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,600
it'll just make her more timid,

581
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,920
I think you don't know

582
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,960
your little sister that well.

583
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,320
Scaring her won't make her feel afraid.

584
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,040
I'm just doing a method of taking away

585
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,920
the firewood from under the cauldron.

586
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,400
At that time,

587
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,960
you just have to ask your Eldest Sister

588
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,720
to surely bring your Sixth Little Sister with her.

589
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,800
I only ask you

590
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,720
to stop mysteriously

591
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,640
swindling our family.

592
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,280
Father, I'm done writing.

593
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,280
Rong's writing is

594
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,360
becoming more and more decent.

595
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,800
A family of clever people.

596
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,560
Come, quickly.

597
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,000
Eldest Sister, I don't want to watch a polo match.

598
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,520
I still have so much needlework

599
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,360
that needs to be finished.

600
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,320
You already have such things in your dowry.

601
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,960
Just have a seat,

602
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,080
You really think you

603
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,600
can personally make all of them?

604
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,200
You'll be the Big Madam

605
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,000
in a marquis family soon.

606
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,120
Eldest Sister, I still haven't agreed!

607
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,775
Just be at ease and sit here first.

608
00:26:57,775 --> 00:26:58,520
Let's watch the game.

609
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,475
The incense has completely burned out!

610
00:27:01,475 --> 00:27:03,080
Red Team earns ten points!

611
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,920
In this round, the Red Team wins!

612
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:10,000
Their prize is a jade scepter.

613
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,560
Good!

614
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,480
Why is he here?

615
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,120
It was he

616
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:19,800
who begged the Empress

617
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,880
to organize this polo match,

618
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,420
so of course he'll attend!

619
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,240
What?

620
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,920
Don't you find it strange?

621
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,720
Look.

622
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,320
The grasses here aren't fully grown yet.

623
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,150
He had to make lots of efforts for asking Her Highness

624
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:32,840
to organize such a polo match

625
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,160
since it's already the start of spring.

626
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,720
He just wants to

627
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,000
have a few words with you.

628
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,920
Respectfully greeting Your Highness the Empress!

629
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,680
Zhonghuai, aren't you playing today?

630
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,600
Why aren't you in your sport suit?

631
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,800
Without a good prize,

632
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,920
it's no fun to play.

633
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,240
Oh, you don't care about all those prizes?

634
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,760
Do you want the stars

635
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,680
in the sky or something?

636
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,080
Your Highness,

637
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,200
I will get married soon.

638
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,040
I earnestly ask Your Highness to

639
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,600
grant me something as my betrothal gifts,

640
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:15,920
so I can give it

641
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,640
to my future wife

642
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,320
to express how I cherish her.

643
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,520
I don't know which family's lady

644
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,880
has such good fortune

645
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,880
of getting a husband like you?

646
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,560
This is a hairpin I used

647
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,720
when I was crowned as the Empress.

648
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,160
Considering how you repeatedly risked your life

649
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,040
to save His Majesty from danger,

650
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,760
I'll give it to you then.

651
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,040
Take it, and make it your betrothal gift.

652
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,160
Thank you, Your Highness!

653
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,200
However, you have to win the next game

654
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,880
rean this.

655
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,360
I, your official, shall obey!

656
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,440
Why are you running away?

657
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,720
Miss, where are you going?

658
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,120
Miss! Miss! Where are you going?

659
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,800
Going home!

660
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,600
Miss,

661
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,480
our house carriage is over there!

662
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,120
Miss, slow down!

663
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,160
I have something to tell you.

664
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,960
Second Uncle,

665
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,160
are you using your power and status to oppress me?

666
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,160
Don't worry.

667
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,920
I'm not a person who pesters you without pauses.

668
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,000
Today,

669
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,680
I want to tell you my sincere words.

670
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,600
If you still won't agree,

671
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,200
I won't pester you anymore.

672
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,720
Also,

673
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,825
didn't I tell you to stop calling me

674
00:30:31,825 --> 00:30:32,320
Second Uncle?

675
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,040
I want to know

676
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,720
why you are not willing to marry me.

677
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,120
I don't want to

678
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,120
hear some fancy words.

679
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,080
I want to hear the truth.

680
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,720
I...

681
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,040
I fear that

682
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:55,880
I can't be a good wife.

683
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,360
I'm not virtuous, nor gentle and submissive.

684
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,600
I'm also not well-experienced.

685
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,640
I will just bring you shame.

686
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,080
That doesn't sound like the truth.

687
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,000
Your Gu Family has a complex family relationship

688
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,080
and there are a lot of conflicts.

689
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,280
I'm just a daughter from a small clan,

690
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,720
and not that well-experienced.

691
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,720
I won't be able to

692
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,960
handle such a huge clan.

693
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,760
That sounded a bit true now.

694
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,720
Don't worry.

695
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,480
After our wedding,

696
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,360
we'll be living in another manor.

697
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,475
You don't need to worry about

698
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:34,440
those nasty and worrisome matters.

699
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,520
We can even live in a separate manor?

700
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,475
When the time comes,

701
00:31:39,475 --> 00:31:40,920
if you want to live in the Marquis Manor,

702
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,880
we will live there.

703
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,560
If you want to live elsewhere,

704
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,560
we'll stay elsewhere.

705
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,320
I can't promise

706
00:31:47,725 --> 00:31:48,720
you will have everything

707
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,040
if you marry me.

708
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,160
Just one thing,

709
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,120
I will not let you

710
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,520
be aggrieved from now on.

711
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,720
I-I was raised in quite an extravagant manner.

712
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,840
When was I aggrieved?

713
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,360
I also don't need

714
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,720
anyone to act as some hero

715
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,720
and save me from danger.

716
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,280
You...

717
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,360
are just an eloquent

718
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,560
little liar.

719
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,040
You've always kept your grievances to yourself.

720
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,840
You've been suffering

721
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,920
since you were born.

722
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,080
You can't stand the etiquette

723
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,560
around being a legitimate and illegitimate child,

724
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,400
but you have no choice but to obey.

725
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,920
You clearly are good at everything,

726
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,160
but you have to keep a low profile every time.

727
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,040
You dare not to crop up,

728
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,320
so you looked for an ordinary family

729
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,920
like the He Family.

730
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,120
Crop up?

731
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,000
Because I cropped up,

732
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,600
I caused a lot of trouble.

733
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,000
You personally saw it.

734
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,880
But what happened to me afterwards?

735
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,760
I don't like sewing，

736
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,280
or embroidering.

737
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:00,680
I have to pretend

738
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,760
to like everything

739
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,040
that I don't like.

740
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,760
But what can I do?

741
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,240
I have to survive first.

742
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,360
It's because you're too sensible.

743
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,080
You're smart. You're simple.

744
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,100
You're able to see everything clearly.

745
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,000
Hence, you dare not go

746
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,320
beyond the bottom line by a step.

747
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,275
But you can't totally resign yourself to your plight.

748
00:33:19,275 --> 00:33:19,920
You feel the injustice.

749
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,560
You suffer. You keep it to yourself.

750
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,720
You can only pretend to be dumb and be in a daze,

751
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,880
always being very cautious.

752
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,280
You forced yourself

753
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,575
to become a flawless Sixth Miss

754
00:33:28,575 --> 00:33:29,360
of the Sheng Family.

755
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,040
I'm not willing to see you living

756
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,480
the rest of your life like that.

757
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,760
I dare not say that marrying me

758
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,880
will give you a very good life.

759
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,880
I can only swear

760
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,560
by the heavens, one thing,

761
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,200
that from now on,

762
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,080
whatever my rank is among the men,

763
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,160
that will be your rank among the women.

764
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,640
I've long admired you

765
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,680
and am willing to marry you to be my wife,

766
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,840
entrust you my house for you to manage,

767
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,375
and entrust to you

768
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:56,360
the propagation of my bloodline.

769
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,960
Spend the rest of my life with you.

770
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,120
Second Gu! Come and have a match with me!

771
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,800
Today, I must defeat you!

772
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,760
Don't listen to him.

773
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,360
Why not?

774
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,160
Then you...

775
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,920
You won't be able to win the prize then.

776
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,320
Of course I can.

777
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,760
There are two of them. Do you have any partner?

778
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,000
me alone is already enough.

779
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,640
If we play together,

780
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,240
will that make them lose badly?

781
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,720
Okay.

782
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,700
Let's make them

783
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,440
lose so badly together!

784
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,000
I'm really so happy today.

785
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,560
For so many years,

786
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,000
I haven't been so happy!

787
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,520
I'm also happy.

788
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,920
It's done!

789
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,400
Little Sister, you're now a noble person.

790
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,480
How come you still

791
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,400
have the time to come to my place?

792
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,560
Fifth Sister, are you mad?

793
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,200
Then I'll come another time.

794
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,040
Sixth Miss!

795
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,440
Sixth Miss,

796
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,700
Fifth Miss actually misses you a lot.

797
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,640
Sixth Miss, please come in

798
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,480
and have a chat with her.

799
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,760
Xique,

800
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,880
how are your wounds?

801
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,400
Thank you Miss for being concerned.

802
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,200
Actually, they didn't really hit me hard that day.

803
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,600
Fifth Miss even pounced on me

804
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,640
to block some of them.

805
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,400
They've completely healed

806
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,400
after applying medicines for a few days.

807
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,560
Rest well then.

808
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,560
Don't be tired.

809
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,920
Thank you, Miss.

810
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,000
Fifth Sister.

811
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,960
What? You now meddle

812
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,480
with the affairs of my maidservants?

813
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,080
From now on,

814
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,880
you really can do anything here in this house.

815
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,800
My mother said

816
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,960
that the betrothal gifts

817
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,360
that Gu Family sent to you

818
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,160
can be piled up to form a mountain.

819
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,240
Looks like from now on,

820
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,840
I might need you

821
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,080
to support me.

822
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,840
Big Madam surely

823
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,440
didn't say just those words.

824
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,680
Of course not.

825
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,760
The advantages of your marriage

826
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,300
are also not just those items.

827
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,920
You also don't have a bane

828
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,040
of newly-wedded wives,

829
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,640
your husband's parents.

830
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,240
That's nothing to be proud of.

831
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,840
You also don't have a father-in-law.

832
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,640
But you don't know that mother-in-law of mine.

833
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,800
A few days ago,

834
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,400
she came here to meet Mother.

835
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,000
She was so mean and unkind!

836
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,120
Her son just got into the top twenty,

837
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,240
in thirteenth place in the examinition.

838
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,160
It's much lower than that

839
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,600
of my Second Brother.

840
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,080
I didn't even make any comment.

841
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,360
But her?

842
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,080
it seemed as if she has become the mother of

843
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,640
the Heavenly Emperor!

844
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,360
She was really ostentatious.

845
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,320
She even said things like...

846
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,680
that if I marry into their family,

847
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,520
living in one courtyard

848
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,360
is enough.

849
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,720
It infuriated Mother to the point that

850
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,200
she had to come to my room and vent out her anger.

851
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:25,200
She even said that when your future mother-in-law

852
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,360
and Second Gu

853
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,794
came to propose,

854
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,550
they were so noble,

855
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:32,230
refined, and amicable.

856
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,360
I'm so angry.

857
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,560
Fifth Sister,

858
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,360
are you willing to

859
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,520
exchange our husbands?

860
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,760
Are you willing to

861
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,320
Of course I am!

862
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,560
From the start,

863
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,680
I found Brother-in-law not a bad person.

864
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,875
He will even climb up walls

865
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:52,920
to meet the woman he loves.

866
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,280
He even knows to recite poems or songs,

867
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,640
so sentimental.

868
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,360
When he gave his betrothal gifts yesterday,

869
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,080
he made an oath

870
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,160
in front of Father and Mother

871
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,080
that even if there are seven or eight princesses

872
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,840
that like him,

873
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,920
he won't change his initial heart.

874
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,560
Now that he has passed the civil examination,

875
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,320
he's now a disciple of His Majesty.

876
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,480
Isn't that what they describe

877
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,840
as an immortal lad in stories?

878
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,080
You dare!

879
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,880
What are you being mad about then?

880
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,320
Sixth Little Sister, I just thought

881
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,120
that ferocious face of

882
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,400
Eldest Sister's mother-in-law

883
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,600
when I visited her

884
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,160
before.

885
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,960
Back then,

886
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,320
I told myself that

887
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,560
if I'm going to have such an aggrieved life,

888
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,920
I'd rather

889
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,200
be an old maid.

890
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,320
Actually,

891
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,960
I'm really afraid.

892
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,425
I'm afraid that

893
00:39:51,425 --> 00:39:53,440
Brother Jing will become unfaithful to me.

894
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,760
I fear that

895
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,175
Mother-in-law will bully me from now on.

896
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,600
I fear that my future life

897
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,120
will be worse than Molan's.

898
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,280
I don't want to marry anymore.

899
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,760
People say that there are three things

900
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,880
in this world that you mustn't believe in.

901
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,825
One is when old people say

902
00:40:13,825 --> 00:40:15,200
that they don't want to live anymore.

903
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,800
The second is when children say

904
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,760
that they don't want to grow up.

905
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,120
Third...

906
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,440
What is the third one?

907
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,960
When a lady says that she doesn't want to marry!

908
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,040
What if...

909
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,120
we could just directly become mothers-in-law?

910
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,960
It's really so hard to get married.

911
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,200
A mother-in-law also started out

912
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,080
being a daughter-in-law.

913
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,920
You will have that day.

914
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,600
Then it's better

915
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,280
not to have any mother-in-law.

916
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,000
If there's no mother, how can there be a son?

917
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,600
What you said is more ruthless

918
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,500
than saying you don't want the monk right after

919
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,840
he prayed for you.

920
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,080
Sixth Sister, I want...

921
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,960
that our future days

922
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,320
will both be well.

923
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,920
Of course.

924
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,040
All living people must live their days.

925
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,880
Only dead people don't have to.

926
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,800
You must be careful.

927
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,040
Those Gu relatives

928
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,200
will look down on you

929
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,240
for being an illegitimate child.

930
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,880
They will give you supercilious looks.

931
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,480
It's fine.

932
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,920
I just don't look at them.

933
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,520
You're intelligent and quick-witted.

934
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,200
They surely will love you.

935
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,720
You too.

936
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,000
Me?

937
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,440
I'm not like that!

938
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,480
Thinking about those relatives of the Gu Family,

939
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,360
they surely will

940
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,280
make it hard for you.

941
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,280
You mustn't take them to heart

942
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,600
and get angry about it.

943
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,600
Fifth Sister also told me

944
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,160
the same thing today.

945
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,400
I understand. Don't worry.

946
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,840
That Fifth Girl is a straightforward person.

947
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,800
Those betrothal gifts that

948
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,240
Second Gu sent today

949
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,040
were enough to fill a courtyard.

950
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,080
You can see that he didn't get them in a day.

951
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,200
He has long

952
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,040
prepared them

953
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,200
when he proposed to

954
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,200
Sister Yanran before.

955
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:32,960
No.

956
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,720
Old Madam Yu

957
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:35,900
told me about

958
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,560
that list of betrothal gifts for Yanran.

959
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,040
They are not the same things.

960
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,480
Really?

961
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,200
A few days ago,

962
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,800
I wrote Sister Yanran a letter.

963
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,800
I told her about my marrying into the House of Gu.

964
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,280
Sister Yanran was so shocked

965
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,440
and asked me if I was being forced.

966
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,160
I replied to her, and said I was not.

967
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,550
But after thinking about it,

968
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:59,040
I felt that I'm indeed being forced.

969
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,520
Talking about that,

970
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,240
the time when you defended her

971
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,040
seems like it happened a generation ago.

972
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:12,600
Now, it's you who ended up in the House of Gu.

973
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,480
All these are yours now.
