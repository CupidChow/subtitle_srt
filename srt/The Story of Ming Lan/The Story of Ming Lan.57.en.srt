00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Ming Lan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,580
Episode 57

3
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,240
Prime Minister.

4
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,400
Your Majesty.

5
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,280
Royal Mother, what are you doing then?

6
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,600
I'm old and tired.

7
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,360
I've already placed my imperial seal.

8
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,680
I'm not meddling with any affairs anymore.

9
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,720
Your Majesty...

10
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,800
why must you still painstakingly force me?

11
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,880
Empress Dowager, you...

12
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,200
My life is hard.

13
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,200
Empress Dowager,

14
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,160
since you personally stamped your seal,

15
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,520
that's enough.

16
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,600
Enough. Enough.

17
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,600
You are sick.

18
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,160
Quickly return to the inner palace and rest.

19
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,800
Wait!

20
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,400
Empress Dowager, may I ask

21
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,040
Servants!

22
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,840
Quickly assist Empress Dowager back to rest.

23
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,720
The royal physicians must

24
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,920
stay by her side.

25
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,480
Yes.

26
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,440
Empress Dowager! Empress Dowager!

27
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,800
Your Majesty,

28
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,160
why didn't you wait for us to finish asking?

29
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,160
Empress Dowager already said yes.

30
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,000
If official continue to ask her forcefully,

31
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,750
do you want Empress Dowager

32
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,110
to write you a guarantee letter?

33
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,360
Your Majesty,

34
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,325
if you get close to fawning and crafty subjects,

35
00:03:37,325 --> 00:03:38,640
you'll stay farther away from the virtuous ones.

36
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,840
The crafty subjects did rash actions.

37
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,450
They deceived Empress Dowager

38
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,040
to release a written decree,

39
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,520
causing her to

40
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,520
be in fear and panic,

41
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,840
unable to directly tell the truth.

42
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,900
This shockingly frightening matter

43
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,480
has never happened before,

44
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,960
and has never been heard in this world.

45
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,800
We, officials of the Censorate

46
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,310
and Remonstrance Bureau,

47
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,280
were bounded by imperial duty

48
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,760
to correct your mistakes.

49
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,800
But now,

50
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,960
we're unable to do so.

51
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,960
We've disappointed the empire.

52
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,080
May Your Majesty,

53
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,025
remove me from my post of being

54
00:04:17,025 --> 00:04:18,560
the Grand Master of the Remonstrance Bureau!

55
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,240
So, if it doesn't suit your liking,

56
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,320
you can just irresponsibly give up your work?

57
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,440
The ministers of the palace secretariat

58
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,080
are good in embellishing their words.

59
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,075
They harbored treacherous

60
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,080
subject intentions to bewitch you.

61
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,240
May Your Majesty punish the fawning subjects.

62
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,625
Investigate the mistake

63
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:50,760
of the different ministers.

64
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,480
Remove from office Han Zhang, Shen Congxing,

65
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,300
and the others

66
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:53,700
to purge the palace

67
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,400
and outside of treacherous officials!

68
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,360
Whether we are evil or virtuous,

69
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,440
Your Majesty surely knows.

70
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,020
The Censorate and Remonstrance Bureau

71
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,020
ask Your Majesty to be away from crafty subjects.

72
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,760
Remove from office Han Zhang,

73
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,400
Shen Congxing, and the others.

74
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,560
Your Majesty,

75
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,600
it seems that the imperial censors

76
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,575
think they can't endure standing

77
00:05:35,575 --> 00:05:36,720
in the same imperial court

78
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,320
as me anymore.

79
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,080
Since that's the case,

80
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,200
if you think that I have committed a crime,

81
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,400
please have the imperial censors stay.

82
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,480
If you think that I'm innocent,

83
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,080
please use your imperial decree

84
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,520
to punish and demote the imperial censors.

85
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,140
May Your Majesty decide wisely.

86
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,840
May Your Majesty decide wisely.

87
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,240
May Your Majesty decide wisely.

88
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,640
Qi Heng, the Grand Master of the Remonstrance Bureau,

89
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,040
be demoted.

90
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,160
I, Qi Heng,

91
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,280
respectfully thank Your Majesty!

92
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,400
May Your Majesty remove us from our post too.

93
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,720
Demote! Demote!

94
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,200
Demote!

95
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,080
Second Auntie.

96
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,960
Main Mother.

97
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,440
You both are done reading them?

98
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,920
We're done.

99
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,760
Who among you will talk first?

100
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,200
I've read the accounting books for 5 days

101
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,680
and then spent 2 days verifying them.

102
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,680
There's one part that I couldn't understand.

103
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,900
The manor bought grains from outside

104
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,984
for only 2 to 3 times,

105
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,280
but what's written on the books

106
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,100
is that the price each time

107
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,040
was more expensive than the last.

108
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,340
If we're going to say that it's because

109
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,539
of different seasons when the purchase was made,

110
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,880
hence, the difference in prices.

111
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,440
But I've compared it.

112
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,960
Purchases made on the same month still

113
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,840
were higher than the previous ones.

114
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,880
There is clearly something fishy in here.

115
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,600
Xian'er, you're older.

116
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,640
What do you think?

117
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,700
I feel that in managing a house,

118
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,840
you mustn't be overly strict.

119
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,440
If you make a fuss in every details,

120
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,120
not even ignoring just little amount of silver,

121
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,200
I fear that you might lose the

122
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:56,980
big picture just for a small matter.

123
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,440
And...

124
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,525
if there was something

125
00:08:01,525 --> 00:08:02,200
that I wasn't able to think about,

126
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,400
sister can just say it.

127
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,880
I compared the books to supplementary documents

128
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,925
and saw that the prices

129
00:08:06,925 --> 00:08:08,200
have gone up because of water-logs.

130
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,200
I also heard that a waterlog

131
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,520
can bring damage that can last for 3 years.

132
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,720
Although you might say that all are just excuses,

133
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,640
it is still possible that it's true.

134
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,240
I feel that this should

135
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,760
be considered too.

136
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,080
Rong'er,

137
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,200
do you think what she said is true?

138
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,240
Sister and I have discussed about it,

139
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,880
and we find it more just an excuse.

140
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,880
Have you tried to verify it?

141
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,280
These... These accounting books

142
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,640
are from decades ago.

143
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,000
How are we going to verify it?

144
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,080
Think about it then.

145
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,480
How can you verify it?

146
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,920
Once you do, come back and answer my question.

147
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,040
Yes.

148
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,160
Main Mother.

149
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,400
Why are you back again?

150
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,840
What is it?

151
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,960
Father hasn't been talking

152
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,760
with you a lot lately.

153
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,680
I...

154
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,600
What about you?

155
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,320
Before,

156
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,800
father would always do some act

157
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,960
to make you angry.

158
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,960
These past days,

159
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,960
he isn't doing that anymore.

160
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,680
Your father was punished in the morning court.

161
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,280
Of course, he's unhappy because of it.

162
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,240
If your maiden crafts teacher

163
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,760
would hit your palm with a stick,

164
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,720
won't you also cry and sniffle?

165
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,440
Father cried and sniffled?

166
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,240
It's exactly because

167
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,480
he's embarrassed to do so,

168
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,480
that's why, he's madder.

169
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,320
It's fine. Don't put it to heart.

170
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,760
He didn't lose his temper on you, right?

171
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,429
No.

172
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,160
He just doesn't joke anymore.

173
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,160
He would be fine in a few days.

174
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,480
Don't worry, Rong'er.

175
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,880
Rest early. Go now.

176
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,440
Big Madam,

177
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,840
even Eldest Miss have noticed it.

178
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,800
You better think of a way.

179
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,840
Stop letting Marquis sleep in the study.

180
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,280
Also,

181
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,520
Old Madam told Nanny Cui to relay a message

182
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,320
that if you have free time,

183
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,960
go and visit her.

184
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,600
Who's the tattletale

185
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,640
that reported

186
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,840
this matter to my grandmother?

187
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,320
Grand Madam Qin in the next door

188
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,160
already knew it,

189
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,200
so of course, Madam Kang also knows of it.

190
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,520
With her knowing,

191
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,660
our Big Madam Wang

192
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,320
would also know.

193
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,840
Then how could

194
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,000
Old Madam not know?

195
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,000
When will

196
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,080
I have any free time?

197
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,250
The approaching stormy clouds

198
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,120
is making me too worried.

199
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,320
You are just there reading

200
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,640
accounting books?

201
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,920
Yes.

202
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,240
Have you seen your Second Uncle.

203
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,920
Second Uncle was sitting on the side.

204
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,480
Really?

205
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,550
He even said that we were not

206
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,160
meticulous in reading the books.

207
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,560
Second was just demanding the best from you.

208
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,600
But, to let a teenager

209
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,800
read those accounting books

210
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,120
is such a tiring task.

211
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,520
Daughter-in-law,

212
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,680
let her drink more teas

213
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,240
that's good for her eyesight.

214
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,080
Don't let her tire her eyes out.

215
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,400
Yes.

216
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,640
Didn't you say that

217
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,320
your Second Uncle weren't inside the room?

218
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,400
Whether he's in the room or not

219
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,400
is not grandmother's business,

220
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,240
and is not our business.

221
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,400
Uncle and Auntie aren't inquiring

222
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,960
about grandmother's matters,

223
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,160
so why

224
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:49,920
must grandmother have me

225
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,280
investigate theirs?

226
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,520
Mother, stop paying attention to

227
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,080
those leisure words next time.

228
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,200
I indeed don't want to give them attention,

229
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,840
but not only must you read

230
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,200
those accounting books of your Second Auntie

231
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,300
until it's pitch dark,

232
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,640
you even have to be questioned for a long time.

233
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,400
Must this matter be done so urgently?

234
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,125
How many people are there in the house

235
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:04,680
that can read accounting books?

236
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,960
Why must she let a teenager

237
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,040
like you read them?

238
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,350
If grandmother asks

239
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,920
about the adjacent house again,

240
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,920
how would you answer?

241
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,575
How would I know what's happening

242
00:13:14,575 --> 00:13:15,480
in the adjacent courtyard?

243
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,320
It's just right that you answer that way.

244
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,000
Just say you don't know.

245
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,960
No matter what grandmother asks

246
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,120
regarding Second Uncle or Second Aunt,

247
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,760
just nod and smile.

248
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,960
You mustn't tell them anything

249
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,600
and just let those words

250
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,800
rot in your stomach.

251
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,960
Don't tell it to any person.

252
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,280
What...do you mean?

253
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,800
Mother,

254
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,960
Second Uncle has never meddled with idle matters.

255
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,320
Household matters are all

256
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,880
under the jurisdiction of Second Aunt.

257
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,925
She's a person who always

258
00:13:40,925 --> 00:13:41,880
has a definite plan in mind.

259
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,360
Letting me investigate the accounting books

260
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,400
is a way of taking care

261
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,840
of me and Little Sister Rong.

262
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,200
We mustn't get involved in the conflict

263
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,120
between grandmother and Second Uncle.

264
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,760
Xian'er,

265
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,360
how come you would think this much?

266
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,240
Mother, father told me

267
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,520
that we should live our own days.

268
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,240
Slow down. Slow down.

269
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,840
Don't touch that part!

270
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,080
Lower down the palanquin.

271
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,440
Slowly.

272
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,240
Shitou!

273
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,200
What is this?

274
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,480
Seat pillow.

275
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,440
Am I blind?

276
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,440
I'm asking you, what is this for?

277
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,360
Xiaotao made it.

278
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,920
Look at this little plum on it.

279
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,120
She personally embroidered that.

280
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,160
I was even the one who bought her the threads.

281
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,280
Will I be needing this?

282
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,600
I'm a distinguished commander

283
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,175
and I'm going to the court

284
00:16:25,175 --> 00:16:25,840
with this?

285
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,600
Won't people laugh at me?

286
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,760
How is it not useful?

287
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,040
The wounds on your buttocks...

288
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,120
Shut up!

289
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,360
Take it away.

290
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,360
Slowly...

291
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,680
Okay.

292
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,240
Raise the palanquin!

293
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,400
Wait!

294
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,040
Shitou.

295
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,360
Who ask Xiaotao to make that?

296
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,840
It's just Xiaotao.

297
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,520
Bring it over here.

298
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,680
Bring it here.

299
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,280
You said you won't use it.

300
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,160
Didn't you say that you won't use it?

301
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:20,920
It's my wife

302
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,880
who told Xiaotao to make this.

303
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,200
Raise the palanquin!

304
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,440
Do it slower. Do it slower.

305
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,680
Let's go.

306
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,280
Salt, wine, tea, and iron are

307
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,760
are the main source of income of our dynasty.

308
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,080
Now, the salt taxation is very vague.

309
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,400
The amount being submitted actually don't add up.

310
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,500
We're only able to

311
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,200
receive 30 to 40% of the actual value.

312
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,800
It's hard to clearly investigate it.

313
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,680
If the government still doesn't guard against it,

314
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,240
it will lead to a huge disaster.

315
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,375
I wish Royal Father will issue

316
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,160
an order to investigate this matter.

317
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,250
Clean up the very root of it

318
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,450
to correct the laws and discipline

319
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,120
in the imperial court.

320
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,600
The salt taxation has been a chronic problem.

321
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,725
It has been scribbled in a dark and vague manner.

322
00:18:17,725 --> 00:18:18,320
and vague manner.

323
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,000
The state treasury

324
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,680
has been empty for a long time.

325
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,760
It is indeed the right time

326
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,560
to investigate this matter already.

327
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,240
My subject,

328
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,480
who's willing to go on my behalf?

329
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,240
Salt taxation is a major state affair.

330
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,560
To govern a state cleanly

331
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,900
has always been a difficult problem

332
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,560
since time immemorial.

333
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,240
Are you all considering

334
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,120
kinship and friendship?

335
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,280
But none is willing

336
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,800
to investigate the salt matter

337
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,320
for the government and the citizens?

338
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,640
May I ask Your Majesty

339
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,475
if it is in the next few days

340
00:19:10,475 --> 00:19:12,480
that the Ministry of Rites and Ceremonies

341
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,225
would be transcribing your decree

342
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,135
regarding respectfully acknowledging Prince Shu

343
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:16,920
as your birth father

344
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,280
and announcing this to the whole empire?

345
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,000
We are currently discussing the salt affair.

346
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,000
If you have something to say,

347
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,350
we can talk about it in details

348
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,240
after the morning court.

349
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,920
I then have nothing else to say.

350
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,600
Could it be

351
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,150
that if there's one matter

352
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,160
that doesn't go with what you want,

353
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,440
you all can just stand aside

354
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,480
from political affairs and do nothing?

355
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,150
You all are tightly grabbing onto the law

356
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,160
of rites and won't let it go,

357
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,120
but indulging vermins to eat up our empire.

358
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,760
Aren't you wronging the citizens of this state?!

359
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,320
Your Majesty,

360
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,100
I suggest to let Prime Minster Han

361
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,280
go investigate this matter.

362
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,480
Censorate, no need to be sarcastic.

363
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,520
How could you have the state's prime minister

364
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,120
go around and inspect the empire's territories?!

365
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,120
I dare not.

366
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,120
It's just that...

367
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,960
It's just that...

368
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:38,900
even though the salt affair

369
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,680
indeed have a lot of flaws,

370
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,000
I don't think it's as severe as

371
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,960
what Prince Huan said.

372
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,800
If it's really that severe,

373
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,960
the empire

374
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,840
won't be this peaceful

375
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,880
until now.

376
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,440
Hence, in my opinion,

377
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,960
why not correct the law of rites first,

378
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,925
properly distinguish seniority,

379
00:20:57,925 --> 00:20:59,440
and clearly organize the ancestral bloodline.

380
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,040
Whether it's Royal Father or Royal Uncle,

381
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,680
just one word's difference,

382
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,575
was enough for you all

383
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:18,080
to discuss it for 3 to 5 months.

384
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,720
Some of you surely even want to

385
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,840
jump up this Wende Hall and burn it to the ground.

386
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,520
The salt taxation concerns the state treasury,

387
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,240
the lives of the citizens,

388
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,320
and even our borders and important fortification,

389
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,640
but you all are not concerned about it?

390
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,440
Let me tell you all

391
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,480
that even without the Censorate,

392
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,720
I still must do my job.

393
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,400
I still must make the state treasury

394
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,040
have abundant money.

395
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,375
I still must let the people in this empire

396
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:45,920
have food to eat.

397
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,680
I still must reconquer our borders!

398
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,525
Even if I

399
00:21:52,525 --> 00:21:54,240
must personally inspect the salt trade,

400
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,925
I would clarify the accounting

401
00:21:56,925 --> 00:21:58,160
to the last details.

402
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,840
Your Majesty is wise!

403
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,360
I ask for Royal Father's graces

404
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,440
to allow me to go out and train

405
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,000
by clearly investigating the salt affair.

406
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,120
I'm allowing it.

407
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,760
Thank you, Royal Father!

408
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,480
I surely will not disappoint you

409
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,075
in cleaning up the salt affair and

410
00:22:21,075 --> 00:22:22,880
correcting the law and order of this government!

411
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,800
Weibei General Shen Congxing!

412
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,640
I'm here.

413
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,680
I order you to be the assistant of Prince Huan.

414
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,720
Help him throughout this journey.

415
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,080
I will abide!

416
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,750
Deputy Minister Sheng Changbai

417
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,880
of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices!

418
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,440
I'm here.

419
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,640
You are the person that easily remembers,

420
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,175
have abundant knowledge,

421
00:22:45,175 --> 00:22:45,840
and have a photographic memory.

422
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,800
It's Prince Huan's first time

423
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,520
to handle salt affairs,

424
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,050
so it's natural for him

425
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:50,760
not to know a lot of things.

426
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,520
I ask you to assist him

427
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,000
in investigating the accounting books.

428
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,840
I will accept your decree!

429
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,800
I don't believe that

430
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,450
I won't be able to clearly investigate

431
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,840
the salt affair of this empire.

432
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,840
Your Majesty.

433
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,075
Liecao Deputy Minister Shen

434
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,080
of the Department of State Affairs

435
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:31,920
is waiting outside to seek an audience with you.

436
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,825
He said that he had a strategy to govern the

437
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,985
salt affairs that he wanted to submit to you.

438
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,880
Shen Guotao works for the Ministry of Personnel.

439
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,000
What salt affair strategy can he have?

440
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,320
His son-in-law is

441
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,280
the Qi Heng

442
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,040
of the Ducal House of Qi.

443
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,280
He came to make up for the mistakes of that child.

444
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,760
Parents really

445
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,280
won't stop worrying.

446
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,240
Fine. Let him come in.

447
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:00,880
Yes.

448
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,320
Official, please go in.

449
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,920
That sly fox Duke Qi of the State

450
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,840
is really good

451
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,880
in looking for an in-law.

452
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,960
He's able to squeeze water out

453
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,600
of a stone without crevices.

454
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,000
He let his in-law

455
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,720
see His Majesty

456
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,280
using the pretext of salt affair.

457
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,360
That Princess PIngning of the second rank

458
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,560
isn't also a personality to be belittled about.

459
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,000
She just does what she wants,

460
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,320
without committing any mistake.

461
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,440
With his in-law protecting him like this,

462
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,600
the future potential of Young Lord Qi

463
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,480
is surely boundless.

464
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,440
Everyone says that his wife,

465
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,360
Lady Shen,

466
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,920
is gentle and virtuous,

467
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,960
educated and well-balanced.

468
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,625
A good wife will bring great fortune

469
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:04,960
to his husband and children.

470
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,650
You just recovered from your injuries

471
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,080
and back to the morning court.

472
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,040
You already now that much?

473
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,880
People from the imperial court

474
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,400
indeed have piercing eyes.

475
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,240
Everyone in the palace

476
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,880
has eyes that are tempered

477
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,400
via poisonous fire.

478
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,280
Their eyesight

479
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,080
is way better than yours.

480
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,125
The palace actually praised me

481
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:33,520
as being honest, sincere, warm, and kind.

482
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,040
It then means that

483
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,960
my sight is good too.

484
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,200
You were praised as

485
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,200
being honest, sincere, warm, and kind,

486
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,840
because

487
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,680
I spent money in it.

488
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,720
Why then did you marry me?

489
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,880
You're always acting weird every day.

490
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,360
You know it from the start.

491
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,640
Why then did you still marry me?

492
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,920
Always having this crazy fit every day.

493
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,120
Hey, come! Come here!

494
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,760
What are you doing?

495
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:01,880
I...

496
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,320
haven't seen you like this before.

497
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,000
Are you really mad? This is good.

498
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,040
You're not pretending.

499
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,440
Not virtuous.

500
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,040
I find you so adorable!

501
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,040
I'm not virtuous?

502
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,760
I'm not virtuous?

503
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,760
Not virtuous.

504
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,075
Marquis husband, did you get muddled

505
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:16,600
from drinking liquor?

506
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,120
It's you who's muddled.

507
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,720
You have never been fully conscious.

508
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,680
I really love you being like this.

509
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,840
I must keep it in my heart and remember it well.

510
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,800
I must keep it

511
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,960
in my heart and remember it well.

512
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:31,400
I've made full preparations.

513
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,480
Official Shen and I

514
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,680
can set out by tomorrow.

515
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,480
Tomorrow,

516
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,160
I will personally send you two off.

517
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,640
Thank you, Royal Father!

518
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,425
Your Majesty,

519
00:26:46,425 --> 00:26:48,240
I have something to report.

520
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,480
Say it.

521
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,450
I'm filing a complaint

522
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,160
against Weibe Shen Congxing.

523
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,680
of using his power to seek personal gains,

524
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,175
tolerating his children, siblings,

525
00:26:56,175 --> 00:26:56,991
and his families

526
00:26:56,991 --> 00:26:58,600
to forcibly occupy farmlands,

527
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,690
seizing assets by trickery,

528
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,160
illegally forming political alliances.

529
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,120
You...

530
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,640
You are slandering me!

531
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,120
All these must just be false accusations.

532
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,300
It will be great if everything was indeed

533
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:25,960
just false accusations.

534
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:27,880
But His Majesty has already

535
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,000
asked Official Liu Suyang

536
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,080
to investigate this matter.

537
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,880
I've heard my sister-in-law

538
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,480
talk about that Official Liu.

539
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,880
He's a very incorruptible, fair,

540
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,440
and just person.

541
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,160
It surely can't be hidden.

542
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,720
It can't be hidden.

543
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,080
Do you know something?

544
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,920
Regarding forcibly occupying farmlands

545
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,000
and illegal political alliances,

546
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,720
there are no such things.

547
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,520
It's just that the Zou Family

548
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,840
used the name of my nephew

549
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,480
to set up a high-interest loaning center outside.

550
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,300
I heard that someone couldn't

551
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,040
afford to pay back his debt,

552
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,040
hence, committed suicide.

553
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,880
Say,

554
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,360
it's not us who begged him

555
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,280
to lend money from us.

556
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,750
If he couldn't pay it back,

557
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:16,880
he could have discussed it with us.

558
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:17,920
Why must he

559
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,200
hang himself?

560
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:20,880
That's right.

561
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:22,760
Didn't you say that

562
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,440
your nephew was personally

563
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,680
raised by Madam Zou,

564
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,160
and is a very disciplined person?

565
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,440
It's exactly for that reason.

566
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,560
He has already lost his mother,

567
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,000
and his aunt is a concubine in their house.

568
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,800
She doted him so much. This...

569
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,000
When his uncle colluded

570
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,360
and borrowed money from him,

571
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,360
how could he disregard the kinship affection?

572
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,280
It was really not

573
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,920
my nephew's fault, Minglan.

574
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,720
I understand. I understand.

575
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,200
No, you don't.

576
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,960
It's just right and proper

577
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,400
for a debt to be paid.

578
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,760
How come when somebody hanged himself,

579
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,160
our family became the one at fault?

580
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,280
My older brother is a military warrior.

581
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,033
In the imperial court,

582
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,360
how could he beat those scholarly officials

583
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,920
with tongue as sharp as a sword?

584
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,240
Minglan...

585
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,440
You still have to breastfeed your child.

586
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,600
Don't get too agitated.

587
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,000
Little Sister Shen,

588
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,200
all these are matters

589
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,320
of the morning court.

590
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,120
If you're crying here,

591
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,320
isn't that just adding to

592
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,680
the burden of Brother Shen?

593
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,320
Stop and

594
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,360
just go home to wait for news.

595
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,360
It might not really be bad news.

596
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,640
Marquis Gu,

597
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,480
you are the only

598
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,960
educated person among them.

599
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,680
You mustn't watch as my older brother

600
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,000
and my nephew go to jail.

601
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,375
For the emperor, everything can be

602
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:46,960
handled with an imperial decree.

603
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:00,640
Raise the palanquin.

604
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,560
A young lady who's usually

605
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,560
so energetic and cheerful,

606
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,320
has now cried to the point of her eyes

607
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,680
to be swollen like walnuts.

608
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,880
Stop crying.

609
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,760
It might affect her milk.

610
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,600
If this crime is escalated too much,

611
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,400
people indeed might get executed.

612
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,320
But toning it down,

613
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,225
it's just someone committing suicide

614
00:30:20,225 --> 00:30:21,160
because of fear of paying up his debts.

615
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,600
Not only will he be absolved of his crimes,

616
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,520
he would even be paid a handsome amount of money.

617
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,025
In this world, it's just right that matters

618
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:28,000
are handled without including personal bias.

619
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,360
But if someone

620
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,320
wants to foil things,

621
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,500
he surely will act the opposite manner

622
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,080
and make this personal.

623
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,120
It's still my wife who is smart.

624
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,040
If that Miss Shen can

625
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,040
just be half as wise as you,

626
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,720
she wouldn't be running

627
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,760
here to cry today.

628
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,320
I haven't done writing my memorial!

629
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,075
Stop writting!

630
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:49,795
Why are you writing

631
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,840
your own memorial?

632
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,550
Why then do you still have a secretary

633
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:51,840
in your house?

634
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,880
Just let them write it.

635
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,100
Let's go!

636
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:54,600
Go. Go. Go.

637
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,120
Go. Go.

638
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,280
You are already married now.

639
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,400
Why are we still going some Guanyun Brother?

640
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,640
If your wife knows this,

641
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,440
she's surely beat you

642
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,040
up with a pole!

643
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,680
Isn't this

644
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,640
to comfort Brother Shen?

645
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,440
Even if he gets beaten up,

646
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,360
he'll willing accept it.

647
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:05,320
Let's go.

648
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,000
Say you,

649
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,160
you will be having marriage talks soon.

650
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,600
Aren't you afraid that it might fail?

651
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,680
Brother Shen

652
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,560
is waiting there!

653
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,080
Let's go.

654
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:11,760
Old Shen is also acting rashly.

655
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,400
Let me tell you,

656
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,560
Xiao Duan can skip it,

657
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,400
but you can't.

658
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,480
If you don't go,

659
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,040
those top girls of Guangyun Brothel

660
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,240
won't come out and see old brutes like us.

661
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,040
Yes!

662
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,200
Come already, brother.

663
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:22,950
Just treat it as taking me

664
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:23,640
to experience the world.

665
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,400
Look at how delicately beautiful

666
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,680
the women of Bianjing is.

667
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,360
Okay. Okay. Let's go.

668
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,240
Tell the Big Madam that

669
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,080
I've went out

670
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,040
to have some drinks.

671
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:32,760
Let's go.

672
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,600
I won't come back for dinner anymore!

673
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,360
Not coming back! Not coming back!

674
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,120
Let's go!

675
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,760
Look at you two... Really...

676
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,320
Let me ask you,

677
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,120
if...

678
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,960
there is a wife in this world,

679
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,920
who is very smart and capable.

680
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,400
She has a husband

681
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,520
who finds her

682
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,320
every speech or act

683
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,120
as being very interesting.

684
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,160
Appreciating beauties when you are young

685
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,800
is just normal human pleasure.

686
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,280
Also,

687
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,960
this wife is very gentle and submissive.

688
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,880
She's always docile and obedient with

689
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,720
what her husband does.

690
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,320
But that husband...

691
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,520
just kept feeling discontented.

692
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,800
Tell me, why is that?

693
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,880
Marquis, you stumped me with that question.

694
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,320
Are you talking about yourself,

695
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,120
or asking for others?

696
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,880
For cheesy matters like that,

697
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,760
of course, I'm asking in behalf of others.

698
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,960
Come. Come. Let's drink.

699
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,680
Come.

700
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,920
If one person lowers down herself,

701
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,760
and become too docile and obedient,

702
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,360
yet the husband still isn't happy,

703
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,040
I fear that he already finds her boring.

704
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,480
No such thing.

705
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,640
Still interesting.

706
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,200
She's very interesting.

707
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,120
What then are the things that she does

708
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,920
that makes you happy?

709
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,880
One time,

710
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,680
she ate half a pig's trotter by herself.

711
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,200
She ate it with her face being full of oil.

712
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,950
That moment was even happier

713
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:30,920
than celebrating new year.

714
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,880
That time, she was truly happy.

715
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,000
There was no thinking involved.

716
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,480
Everything was sincere.

717
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,320
It seems that your wife

718
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,280
is also a person without pretenses.

719
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,960
Quite the opposite.

720
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,880
She's always covering up.

721
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,840
No matter what I say,

722
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,500
she nods her head.

723
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,500
No matter what I does,

724
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,460
she speaks in support.

725
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,000
I really don't know

726
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,040
if she's really helping me,

727
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,040
or just doing it for his marquis husband.

728
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,480
Marquis,

729
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,880
you really think that

730
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,680
you exposed yourself just now?

731
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,880
The moment you start speaking,

732
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,160
I already knew it.

733
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,400
He...

734
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,600
He has the personality

735
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,080
of making trouble out of nothing.

736
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,240
Who among the houses here in Bianjing

737
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,800
is as peaceful as his?

738
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,760
Which Big Madam

739
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,560
is as virtuous as his wife?

740
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,360
I don't want a virtuous person.

741
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,200
I want a real person.

742
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,400
You even want a deity-like immortal?

743
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,200
What deity-like immortal? You're drunk.

744
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,320
What deity-like immortal? You're drunk.

745
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,650
A flock of crows circles the tree three times,

746
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:50,880
yet unable to find a branch to perch on.

747
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,080
Why not just have a drink?

748
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,720
When there are too many problems,

749
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,480
why not just get drunk?

750
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,300
I seemed to haven't seen Xiao Duan

751
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,340
for quite some time.

752
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,320
Where did he go?

753
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,360
Old Geng,

754
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,840
have you seen Xiao Duan?

755
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,840
He's drunk

756
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,640
and went to sleep.

757
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,960
Where did he go to sleep?

758
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,280
This Guanyun Brothel is such a huge place.

759
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,240
Can he still not find a place to sleep?

760
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,200
I think this is not right.

761
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,880
I might develop a sty.

762
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,400
They probably are resting.

763
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,320
Lower down your voice.

764
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,200
Let's go!

765
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,160
How about it?

766
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,560
Are you now at ease?

767
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,680
We are amidst a lot of problems right now.

768
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,720
It's better to always be careful.

769
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,100
That time in Yuzhou,

770
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,880
the sky is vast and ocean is wide.

771
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,160
But upon coming to Bianjing, everything changed.

772
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,880
Bianjing has its advantages.

773
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,920
Yuzhou's mountains are full of tigers.

774
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,440
Bianjing has...

775
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,440
Sheng Minglan!

776
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,160
Yuzhou is good.

777
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,480
It is better than Bianjing.

778
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,400
Is Guangyun Brothel not good?

779
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,280
Is Fan House not good?

780
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,320
Among all the four oceans and different states,

781
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:43,880
I find that

782
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,520
no other place is as better as Bianjing.

783
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,040
If we're able to take back our borders,

784
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,960
that would be greater.

785
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,320
Prepare to fight!

786
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,160
Go to my place tonight.

787
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,120
Let's chat with our feet facing each other.

788
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,775
Always lamenting on how short is daytime,

789
00:37:09,775 --> 00:37:10,680
and how long is the nighttime.

790
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,175
Why not just hold a candle

791
00:37:12,175 --> 00:37:13,800
and seek pleasure nonstop at night?

792
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,800
Hold a candle and seek fun!

793
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,160
There is indeed a sound.

794
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,440
If there's none, then that will be bad.

795
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,440
Your abdomen is indeed

796
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,080
getting bigger day by day.

797
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,240
Once i have this child,

798
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,720
I finally will have something to put my hopes on.

799
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,320
No matter how chaotic the Shen family gets,

800
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,640
I'm too lazy to care.

801
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,040
Don't be like that.

802
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,160
I'm not unhappy.

803
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,040
It's just that...

804
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,800
the Zou Family

805
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,120
can never be pulled out

806
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:55,960
from the Shen Family anymore.

807
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,240
I must accept that.

808
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,360
It's weird too.

809
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,840
Tell me, both have the same parents.

810
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,240
How come there

811
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,480
was a virtuous Eldest Zou

812
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,640
and then people like that Little Zou

813
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,840
and her evil little brother?

814
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,200
They even harmed

815
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,280
their own nephew.

816
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,025
Even when the dragon bears nine children,

817
00:38:13,025 --> 00:38:13,840
each will be different.

818
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,920
None in my family

819
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,080
was as smart as me.

820
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,520
If your Sister Hualan

821
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,600
hears your words,

822
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,080
she surely will hit you.

823
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,920
Your sisters all married into good families.

824
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,320
If this one in my womb can become as successful

825
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,800
as your

826
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,720
Second Brother,

827
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,920
I then would be very happy.

828
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,120
Don't be like my Second Brother.

829
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,880
Don't you know that

830
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,500
my legitimate daughter would nag about

831
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,400
how unlucky she is everyday?

832
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,720
Marrying an official who doesn't act officially,

833
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,840
but looks more of a landlord.

834
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,760
Giving birth to a son who doesn't act like a son,

835
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,840
but like a father.

836
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,600
Amitabha.

837
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,720
What's wrong?

838
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,040
What's wrong?

839
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,080
It's fine.

840
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,040
He just kicked me.

841
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,960
These past days,

842
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,320
he will kick me ten or more times a day.

843
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,880
I almost had a little brother before,

844
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,680
but he died.

845
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,520
When I see pregnant women

846
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,720
with huge abdomen like that,

847
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,600
I can't help but feel nervous.

848
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,400
What about you?

849
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,975
You've already slept in different rooms

850
00:39:15,975 --> 00:39:16,840
with your marquis husband.

851
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,360
Don't you plan to have one?

852
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,680
We had a fight a few days ago,

853
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,280
but we're now better.

854
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,040
Outside, we only knew that you two

855
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,120
had a fight and are sleeping separately,

856
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,240
but we didn't know that you two have reconciled.

857
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,720
How come this gossip was spread

858
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,440
in such a calculated manner?

859
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,960
Do you know who it is?

860
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,560
If you do,

861
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,640
then I'm at ease.

862
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,320
You and marquis husband must

863
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,760
have lunch here first before leaving.

864
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,400
To avoid him having headaches from the hangover.

865
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,560
Zhonghuai!

866
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,760
Zhonghuai!

867
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,280
Quickly wake up!

868
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,040
Xiao Duan got in trouble!

869
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,080
Xiao Duan got in trouble!

870
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,035
General and Marquis both

871
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,160
went to the local court to check on

872
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,480
the matter concerning General Xiao Duan.

873
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,560
He ordered the Big Madam just do as you want

874
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,920
and entertain Madam Sheng graciously.

875
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:20,920
Marquis instructed that Big Madam

876
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,640
should quickly decide

877
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,000
if you are going back home

878
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,160
or staying here to accompany Big Madam Zhang,

879
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,480
so you won't be going back and forth.

880
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,720
This matter isn't serious.

881
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,560
You two should just enjoy admiring

882
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,160
the flowers or listening to music.

883
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,080
Little Sister,

884
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,560
do you still have anything you want to ask?

885
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,640
Did anything happen

886
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,520
to my Brother Changbai?

887
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,520
Marquis asked the people in the local court

888
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:38,950
and they said that

889
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:39,880
he went to attend the morning court,

890
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,200
and is now back in the Sheng Manor.

891
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,120
Other than that, there's nothing else.

892
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,700
Keep watch of marquis very well then.

893
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,360
If anything happened,

894
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,480
you must tell me.

895
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,520
Don't listen to him,

896
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,960
always reporting the good things only.

897
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,560
I understand.

898
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,240
Official,

899
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,840
if you don't accept my complaint

900
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,640
and try this case in the local court,

901
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,650
I will go to the imperial palace

902
00:40:58,650 --> 00:40:59,472
and drum the Dengwen Drum.

903
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,360
Let's settle this case in front of the emperor!

904
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,720
As an honest woman,

905
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:05,960
why did you go to Guangyun Brothel

906
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,080
at night?

907
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,640
Lady, don't get agitated.

908
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,120
Speak slowly.

909
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,840
Official,

910
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,240
I went there to deliver fishes.

911
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,240
Deliver rouges to the ladies of the brothel.

912
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,680
Rouges and hair oils.

913
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,960
The rouges and foundation used

914
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,400
by the ladies of Guangyun Brothel

915
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,000
are supplied by Yunxia Shop.

916
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,280
There's always a set amount every year.

917
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,720
How come you have to deliver them some too?

918
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,880
Miss Hongbao and I have a good relationship.

919
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,200
She said she wants to use items that

920
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,360
are being used by commoners.

921
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,880
That's why, I brought her some.

922
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,000
So that's the case.

923
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,280
Fish smell is very strong.

924
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,000
Can the rouges and hair oil

925
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:44,920
you even be used?

926
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,400
I wrapped them with oil paper.

927
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,400
You really have thought about it very thoroughly.

928
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,840
Official,

929
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,100
I'm from a poor family.

930
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,160
The husband I married

931
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,880
is just a fisherman!

932
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,150
Obtaining an order from Guangyun Brothel

933
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:01,600
is something that

934
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,920
we cherished a lot.

935
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,720
It's rare that

936
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,240
Miss Hongbao wanted such items,

937
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,840
but I didn't expect...

938
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,440
I didn't expect that upon going up there,

939
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,080
he would suddenly grab me

940
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,880
and drag me to that room!

941
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,120
He then...

942
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,440
He then...

943
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,310
Official,

944
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,880
I'm just a person

945
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,440
without any backer.

946
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,480
How could I still live from now on?

947
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,920
You're saying that I raped you, is that it?

948
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,360
Okay.

949
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,200
Tell me then!

950
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,760
What marks do I have in my body?

951
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,720
You evil man

952
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,080
has a long blade scar on your back!

953
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,900
How did you know?

954
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,680
How did you know that it was a blade scar?

955
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,640
Official,

956
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,440
I killed fishes and sell meat since I was little.

957
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,960
Of course,

958
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,400
I've seen scars like those.

959
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,250
You are lying and destroying

960
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,480
other people's reputation!

961
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,200
I... I didn't!

962
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,200
I didn't do it!

963
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,040
Xiao Duan!

964
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,920
Do you still want to hit me now?

965
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,320
I won't admit to this even if I die!

966
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,400
Official...

967
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,600
Let's go.

968
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,440
Let's go!
