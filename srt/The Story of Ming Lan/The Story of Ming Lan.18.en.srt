1
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,967
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,971
Episode 18

3
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,680
It's because you've

4
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,640
squandered off the Fan wife's dowry,

5
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,440
and now you're coveting

6
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,920
Gu Tingye's uncountable betrothal gifts!

7
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,760
You just want to

8
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,360
sweep Yanran out of the door

9
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,720
to get a seat for Yanhong.

10
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,720
How can you say that?

11
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,880
The reputation of Yu Family's

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,260
generations all being

13
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,600
thrown out by you!

14
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,520
Father.

15
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,560
We didn't mean that.

16
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,320
I will tell you this.

17
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,640
As for Yanran's marriage,

18
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,960
none of you have a say!

19
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,760
But Father and Mother,

20
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,080
as the old saying goes,

21
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,440
"marriage is set

22
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,080
by the parents and sealed by the matchmakers".

23
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,840
I'm Yanran's father,

24
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,040
so naturally I have the say.

25
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,120
Set by the parents and sealed by the matchmaker?

26
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,880
Great then.

27
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,920
Divorce that wretched woman!

28
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:47,960
Father-in-law,

29
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,400
where did that come from?

30
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,200
If you do that,

31
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,720
chase away the matchmaker!

32
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm her father,

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,720
can I actually ruin her?

34
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,800
This writing is still bad.

35
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,160
Miss, how about

36
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,760
opening the hare brush?

37
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,560
Maybe if you have a better brush,

38
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,200
your writing will be better?

39
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,120
That brush. Let's just keep it.

40
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,160
It's the calligraphy book that's not good.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,680
Second Brother hasn't found

42
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,760
a new copybook for me for a while.

43
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,040
Couple days ago, Second Young Master said

44
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,280
he found some new ones

45
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,680
and that he would bring them to you.

46
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,920
Then have him bring them.

47
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,040
Yes.

48
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,100
Second Young Master intends to

49
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:51,920
practice writing with tea?

50
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,480
Then I will

51
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,480
make another cup of tea for you.

52
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,960
I don't know if you'd like

53
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,280
Xiaotuan tea or Longtuan tea?

54
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,920
No need.

55
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,920
What's taking Sixth Sister so long?

56
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,760
It's been enough time to brew two cups of tea.

57
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,720
Go rush her a bit.

58
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,560
Miss, actually

59
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,960
there's nothing to do here.

60
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,240
How about going out?

61
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,560
Second Young Master brought

62
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,400
new calligraphy books for you,

63
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,680
and it's not good

64
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,560
to just keep him waiting.

65
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,400
As long as he's got someone serving him...

66
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,120
Of course, it's Yinxing serving him.

67
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,560
Others can't even snatch that from her.

68
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,080
She was sent here

69
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,960
from Big Madam's room.

70
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,800
It's understandable that she misses her own master.

71
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,280
Danju,

72
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,640
switch to a different pin for me.

73
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,080
This one isn't pretty.

74
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,160
Yes.

75
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,240
It might be a while.

76
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,440
Second Young Master, it's getting hot lately.

77
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,520
The two maidens by you,

78
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,080
Langhao and Yanghao,

79
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,160
have they made you silk shirts?

80
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,640
What are you doing?

81
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,120
This..! Why are

82
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,520
Sixth Sister's maids so unruly?

83
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,680
Brother,

84
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,800
I'm Yinxing

85
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,560
from Big Madam's room.

86
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,080
You don't remember me?

87
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,120
I am just asking about your well-being.

88
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,400
Nonsense!

89
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,160
Sixth Sister.

90
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,280
Your maidservants,

91
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,280
who's in charge of them?

92
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,160
Does she ever train them?

93
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,560
Why are you so angry, Second Brother?

94
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,440
Is Yinxing's service

95
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,320
not good?

96
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,400
Yinxing, hurry and

97
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,560
say sorry.

98
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,800
You've established your own courtyard

99
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,040
and manage the affairs of the Sheng Family.

100
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,240
You should care more about

101
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,880
how good your maids are!

102
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,600
Second Brother, I wonder how Yinxing

103
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,920
has offended you?

104
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,440
At any rate, she's a wreck!

105
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,440
Miss Yinxing

106
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,000
is from Big Madam's maid.

107
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,040
I, I need to

108
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,320
respect Big Madam's prestige.

109
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,920
Or maybe...then...then...

110
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,480
allow me to say sorry.

111
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,200
You're so gentle-tempered.

112
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,360
How can you manage in the future?

113
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,880
Second Young Master's temper has hardened,

114
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,400
and you don't need to worry about it.

115
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,280
Our Miss won't blame you.

116
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,080
Next time, just serve the Miss.

117
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,680
If Second Young Master comes again,

118
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,000
have Xiaotao serve him.

119
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,520
No, next time when he comes,

120
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,520
give me another chance

121
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,520
to make up for today.

122
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,080
That's fine too.

123
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,150
Since you're from Big Madam's room,

124
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,430
our Miss won't blame you.

125
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,600
Miss Yanran.

126
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,640
It's always been customary for the parents

127
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,640
to decide on the children's marriage.

128
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,000
Does that mean

129
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,320
I must marry that Gu Tingye?

130
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,000
But he can't be the one!

131
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,120
What can I do?

132
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,440
You know about

133
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,120
"Lady Li guarding Niangzi Pass"?

134
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,280
Look at this.

135
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,040
This was embroidered by my mother.

136
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,000
My mother thought,

137
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,080
"Princess Zhao of Pingyang,

138
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,320
neither relying on her father or brothers

139
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,880
nor relying on her husband or sons,

140
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,240
could still defeat

141
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,720
a hundred thousand fierce enemies.

142
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,240
She's a model to all women.

143
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,880
Your mother was quite unique.

144
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,080
At the time, my mother was at the brink of death.

145
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,575
It was Second Uncle Gu

146
00:07:16,575 --> 00:07:17,880
who exhausted himself to help,

147
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,120
though in the end

148
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,640
my mother did not survive,

149
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,475
and she passed away in labor

150
00:07:23,475 --> 00:07:24,720
when I was eight years old.

151
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,425
But in my heart,

152
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,825
I am still grateful toward Second Uncle Gu.

153
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,800
Second Uncle Gu is

154
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,000
actually an ardent man.

155
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,600
Ardent?

156
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,840
Do you mean,

157
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,920
it’s okay to say yes to this marriage?

158
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,080
No, no.

159
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,520
I really can’t.

160
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,400
Let me tell you.

161
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,760
Jucao looked into it for me.

162
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,720
That Second Uncle Gu already

163
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,840
had seven or eight chamber-mates,

164
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,840
and he is intimate with prostitutes.

165
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,360
He frequents

166
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,720
entertaining halls and brothels.

167
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,760
You saw it at the match that day.

168
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,360
The one by him

169
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,720
was that Chief Wei of Wide Cloud Terrace.

170
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,480
Yes, I did.

171
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,160
Before my mother passed away,

172
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,200
I was the legitimate heiress of the main wife.

173
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,200
I had no worries

174
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,800
and was raised as treasured as gold and jade.

175
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,920
But now...

176
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,275
I'm just a burden

177
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,195
who can make others frightened.

178
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,880
My grandfather is angry at my father because of me.

179
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,240
My grandmother is sighing day and night.

180
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,520
They doted on me all their life.

181
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,160
Now at their elderly age,

182
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,920
they have to bear this hardship.

183
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,320
Minglan, it was all my fault.

184
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,920
I've caused the family to be in disarray

185
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,880
and I owe grandparents.

186
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,480
If there's no other way,

187
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,440
I will just close my eyes

188
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,600
and marry him!

189
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,160
Stop this nonsense.

190
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,200
But Grandfather is already so aged.

191
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,520
He can't endure this kind of matter.

192
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,920
And my grandmother is crying.

193
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,320
What if something,

194
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,960
something happens to them?

195
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,280
Stop crying.

196
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,840
We both have been motherless since childhood.

197
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,720
We depended on our grandparents' pity

198
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,880
to grow up.

199
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,500
But there are even more reasons for us

200
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,500
not to give up on life so easily.

201
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,320
If you really close your eyes

202
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,120
and marry him,

203
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,840
your life will be stifling later on,

204
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,120
won't Imperial Tutor

205
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,200
still be broken-hearted?

206
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,880
Don't worry.

207
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,880
Imperial Tutor survived a career

208
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,520
through the royal court.

209
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,650
He's not someone who minds

210
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:58,440
such a petty matter.

211
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,920
He and your father

212
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,100
are real father and son,

213
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,400
connected by blood.

214
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,600
In a few days, they'll be fine.

215
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,200
So don't think too much

216
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,520
and put your heart on the tip of your chest.

217
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,640
That's true.

218
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,440
Don't cry anymore.

219
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,880
I'm so glad to have you.

220
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,200
Why are you crying though?

221
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,840
It's because of you.

222
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,600
You just make me

223
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,600
cry.

224
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,440
You're so bad.

225
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,760
That means

226
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,320
this man from Gu House,

227
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,600
once helped you?

228
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,040
Yes.

229
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,680
At the time, I ran on the street

230
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,000
and ran too long.

231
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,640
I was about to

232
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,440
cough up blood.

233
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,200
Thankfully, I ran into Second Uncle Gu,

234
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,320
and so I was able to get a physician home.

235
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,200
What a magnanimous, ardent,

236
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,480
and swift man he is.

237
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,280
Today, we'll light a couple extra incense lamps.

238
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,280
Beg the Taiyi above to

239
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,160
protect our family,

240
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,080
for peace and lasting harmony.

241
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,200
Alright. Let's go.

242
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,440
Go to find Yanran.

243
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,800
Let's get a fortune read.

244
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,720
The Miss's "spouse star"

245
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,800
has no master star,

246
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,500
so it needs to borrow

247
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,480
from the opposite palace.

248
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,600
The opposite palace

249
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,840
has a sun.

250
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,575
The sun as master of spouse palace

251
00:12:14,575 --> 00:12:16,000
will transform good to better.

252
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,195
Transforming to "better" means good,

253
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,960
doesn't it?

254
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,840
It's supposed to be good.

255
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,725
It's a pity to have the sun

256
00:12:22,725 --> 00:12:23,640
seated in the spouse palace

257
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,280
that will delay the marriage.

258
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,080
I think it will be dragged out for a while.

259
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,080
Alright then.

260
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,960
I'm at ease then.

261
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,400
Now calculate my husband

262
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,000
and my son.

263
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,760
When will they talk again?

264
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,840
Greetings, Imperial Tutor.

265
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,840
Please Imperial Tutor

266
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,040
hear me out.

267
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,520
You thought if you found me here,

268
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,720
I would consent?

269
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,880
You had better kill that thought.

270
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,920
You oppose granting this marriage

271
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,880
and I can imagine the reason.

272
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,720
It's good for you to know that.

273
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,560
In the past, I have made many mistakes.

274
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,425
Wanton and unrestrained.

275
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,425
Indeed unworthy for you

276
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,160
to entrust Elder Miss Yu to me.

277
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,680
What do you mean?

278
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,560
The old matters of the past

279
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,200
had their circumstances.

280
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,520
Many things were not really done by me

281
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,600
and may Grand Imperial Tutor see through it.

282
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,720
So you mean

283
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,560
the acts of rogue behavior you made in the past

284
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,840
were done because

285
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,920
others bound you to do so?

286
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,920
Of course not.

287
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,320
I did have

288
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,320
a past of debauchery.

289
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,800
Just that last time at the polo match,

290
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,800
I saw Elder Miss Yu,

291
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,275
and how hard she tried to

292
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,195
protect her late mother's item.

293
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,650
It reminded me of my own loss

294
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:09,880
of mother at a young age.

295
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,880
Because of this shared misery,

296
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,640
I felt very close to her.

297
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,320
And I made up my mind to marry her.

298
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,480
From now on,

299
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,800
I will change myself for the better.

300
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,320
Without any connection

301
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,280
to the prostitutes or brothels,

302
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,400
I'll only keep one woman.

303
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,760
From now on, I shall devote to cultivating myself

304
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,480
without any other concubines or mistresses.

305
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,440
I have some private assets

306
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,600
from maternal home in Yangzhou

307
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,440
and I'm willing to double the betrothal gifts.

308
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,680
Prepare them for Elder Miss Yu

309
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,840
as a show of my sincerity.

310
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,920
We are a generation

311
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,760
of honest scholarly nobles.

312
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,760
We do not covet your wealth.

313
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,240
I mention wealth because I feel guilty.

314
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,560
In terms of merit,

315
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,320
I feel too ashamed.

316
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,650
At the last Imperial exam,

317
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,520
I did not make the roster

318
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,600
and I fear I have no prospect

319
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,360
in the future for that.

320
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,300
Your family is a noble family

321
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,080
of military generals.

322
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,640
You already have a merit-based noble title,

323
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,040
but you went to take the scholarly exam?

324
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,600
Yes.

325
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,840
Then how far did you get?

326
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,440
Just stopped before the Dianshi.

327
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,760
Just stopped before the Dianshi?

328
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,720
That means

329
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,200
you've already passed the Huishi?

330
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,680
I heard from Lord Chen,

331
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,480
that this Gu Tingye...

332
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,720
indeed took the civil exam.

333
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,440
So it means

334
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,360
he was only a rogue in his teens.

335
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,350
From when he started to study

336
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,560
at White Deer Cave Academy

337
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,480
until he made the preliminary exam,

338
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,240
that's only six or seven years.

339
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,880
At his speed?

340
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,800
That's a rarity.

341
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,220
That Gu House. There's that step-mother

342
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,920
and step-brother.

343
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,880
And he's not favored by the Marquis.

344
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,080
That's a wolf den and our Yanran has been tender

345
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,400
since she was a child.

346
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,080
She's so amiable and gentle.

347
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,920
How can she endure that ferociousness?

348
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,040
On that matter,

349
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,120
he's as clear as a mirror on it.

350
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,320
He's preparing to

351
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,720
divide and establish on his own.

352
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,640
So then,

353
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,360
those messy things

354
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,760
in his home,

355
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,960
they won't need a mention anymore.

356
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,475
Well hearing how you speak now,

357
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,715
you seem to want to consent?

358
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,000
I beg you.

359
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,600
Let me see Elder Miss Yu!

360
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,520
I just want to see her.

361
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,440
Go back.

362
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,080
Let me see Miss Yu!

363
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,720
I want to beg her

364
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,120
for mercy for survival!

365
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,760
He is completely Chen Shimei.

366
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,960
Let me see Miss Yu.

367
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,120
Miss, the precinct isn't far.

368
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,920
Go report then.

369
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,680
Abandon his wife and son.

370
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,520
Go to the side gate.

371
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,680
The Yu family is so snobbish.

372
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,240
I just want to see Miss Yu.

373
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,960
Beg her for survival.

374
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,600
Go back first.

375
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,560
The Master and Madam

376
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,480
went to pray at the Buddhist temple.

377
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,000
What about Imperial Tutor?

378
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,600
He's at the palace,

379
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,160
so only the Old Madam and the eldest Miss are home.

380
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,520
That woman keeps saying

381
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,920
she wants to serve me tea,

382
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,440
asking me to pity her

383
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,400
and give her a status,

384
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,640
or she'll kneel forever!

385
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,880
My grandmother got so angry

386
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,280
that she coughed up blood and fainted.

387
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,160
Whatever I did

388
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,520
was so wrong?

389
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,400
After I nurse my grandmother to a better health,

390
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,920
I'll go be a nun at the temple.

391
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,800
We can't let that woman

392
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,960
drag on like this.

393
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,720
But we can't chase her away.

394
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,840
We tried, and she started to

395
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,640
kneel in the alley crying.

396
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,680
At any rate,

397
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,960
my reputation has gone.

398
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,600
I only hope to make my grandmother recover.

399
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,680
Leave her outside then.

400
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,280
Leaving her outside is too shameful.

401
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,400
Grandmother, you are awake.

402
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,000
Grandmother.

403
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,760
Wait. Wait.

404
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,520
Wait for me to run her out.

405
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,360
Run her out.

406
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,800
Alright. Alright.

407
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,920
Let her go.

408
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,480
Since we can't chase her away,

409
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,720
let's get to the bottom of it.

410
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,520
Go back. Go back.

411
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,360
Go back first.

412
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:48,880
Our Old Madam asks you to go in

413
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,760
and respond to her questioning.

414
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,560
We'll talk out here then.

415
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,640
Going into this big mansion.

416
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,600
Who knows if I can come out alive!

417
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,840
In broad daylight,

418
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,040
it's better to talk here.

419
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,720
You!

420
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,040
Miss Yu!

421
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,960
Pity me.

422
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,960
Miss Yu. Miss Yu.

423
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,760
Pity me.

424
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,880
Are you extorting us?

425
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,600
Right?

426
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,120
Chase her out.

427
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,920
No. I won't go.

428
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,560
You can't snatch my man

429
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,440
and chase me out too.

430
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,720
Give me justice!

431
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,280
Get her.

432
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,400
I won't go.

433
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,240
I won't.

434
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,000
Drag her in.

435
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,800
I won't.

436
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,640
Get her in.

437
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,640
No, no. I won't go in.

438
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,000
May Your Ladyship take my tea

439
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,760
and give me a survival path.

440
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,840
You and I never met before

441
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,760
and have no link,

442
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,320
I can't take your tea.

443
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,840
Go now.

444
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,920
What do you mean by no link?

445
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,675
Second Young Master came to your home

446
00:19:50,675 --> 00:19:51,440
to beg marriage,

447
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,200
so in the future,

448
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,560
you will be my mistress in charge.

449
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,360
If you won't allow me,

450
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,640
there's no place

451
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,520
for me in this big world.

452
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,040
I'd be better to die here to spare myself

453
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,960
from humiliation.

454
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,120
Madam,

455
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,280
give me a survival chance please.

456
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,240
Give me a survival chance.

457
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:10,880
Hurry and get up.

458
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,680
Madam,

459
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,600
give me a survival chance.

460
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,320
You get up.

461
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,240
I won't let you die.

462
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,600
Hurry and get up.

463
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,480
Give me a survival chance.

464
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,480
Give me a survival chance.

465
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,175
Hurry and get up.

466
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,560
Hurry and get up.

467
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,000
Who's kneeling?

468
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,600
My maiden home

469
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,240
is surnamed Zhu.

470
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,640
Second Young Master usually calls me Manniang.

471
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,480
I was born to a bitter fate.

472
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,440
I don't think it's bitter at all.

473
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,120
Even if a common woman,

474
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,840
has eaten the gall of a bear,

475
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,975
she won't dare to make a scene

476
00:20:48,975 --> 00:20:49,600
at Imperial Tutor's.

477
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,600
We tell you to leave, and you don't.

478
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,360
We tell you to come in and you don't either.

479
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,360
You'll only cry outside.

480
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,480
How interesting.

481
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,040
Miss, you are noble and refined.

482
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,625
I am a foolish thing.

483
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,745
I've never seen a mansion like this

484
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,040
and I was scared.

485
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,440
You're scared?

486
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,500
Usually, when a house

487
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,280
takes a concubine or mistress,

488
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,960
it will be asked about thoroughly first.

489
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,480
But good for you.

490
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,360
You first come and sob out to the sky!

491
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,175
What's your name,

492
00:21:19,175 --> 00:21:20,040
and where's your home?

493
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,050
Your birthplace?

494
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,480
You didn't inform us of any of that.

495
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,040
And you want my sister to take your tea?

496
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,080
How can you say you're scared?

497
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,400
I am foolish and hadn't thought of it.

498
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,840
Miss can just ask me.

499
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,480
You're from Gu House?

500
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,160
No.

501
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,360
Then you're kept outside.

502
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,880
Yes.

503
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,800
Who are your parents and siblings,

504
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,575
and where do you live?

505
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,040
My parents died early

506
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,280
and I only had one brother,

507
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,080
we relied on each other to survive.

508
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,720
But later he passed away too.

509
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,000
What line of work did he do

510
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,040
while he was alive?

511
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,800
He did labor, moving things at the dock.

512
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,080
That's a proper line of work then.

513
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,080
Yes.

514
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:34,760
She performed operas

515
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,280
in the "Six Delights".

516
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,600
Since he worked at the dock,

517
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,360
how was he acquainted

518
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,440
with the "Six Delights"?

519
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,640
While he was alive,

520
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,720
he did some odd jobs there.

521
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,760
And you?

522
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,480
Me?

523
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,160
I...

524
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,960
I sang there too.

525
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,000
But I only sang for a few days.

526
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,600
My sister can't handle

527
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,480
this matter of you

528
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,160
You go and beg the Gu House yourself.

529
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,440
Gu House dislikes my low birth

530
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,840
and won't take me in,

531
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,800
so I have no choice now.

532
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,200
So I came to beg you

533
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,600
for a survival.

534
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,840
You knew very well Gu House won't accept you,

535
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,680
so you come and force my sister?

536
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,840
She's not even married to him yet,

537
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,760
and you want my sister

538
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,920
to defy her in-laws first?

539
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,960
What a great intention you hold.

540
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,440
Miss. Saving a life

541
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,600
builds you a seven-tiered Buddhist pagoda.

542
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,600
My life is

543
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,200
clenched in your hands.

544
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,200
After you're married,

545
00:23:53,225 --> 00:23:55,240
I will serve him with you,

546
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:55,760
and listen to you...

547
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,680
Shut that mouth!

548
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,400
What marriage? What do you mean,

549
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:58,800
serve him with me?

550
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,400
We've not seen any matchmaker or betrothal!

551
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,080
What link does my sister

552
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:01,960
have with Gu House?

553
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,320
You talk about nonsense

554
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,440
and slander my sister's chaste reputation!

555
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,040
I just want Yu Family

556
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,200
to give me a survival chance.

557
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,400
You must push me to the road to ruin?

558
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,960
Fine.

559
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,880
Then I'll just die here,

560
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,920
to prove my innocence.

561
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,920
No.

562
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,120
Let me go.

563
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,400
Let me die here.

564
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,720
I'll die here!

565
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,280
Let me go. Let go!

566
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,200
I'll die here!

567
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,640
Let her go. Let go!

568
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,480
Let go. Let go of her.

569
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,720
You could have clearly married a common man

570
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,640
and lived a peaceful life.

571
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,975
But you choose to be a kept woman

572
00:25:03,975 --> 00:25:04,520
of a grand house.

573
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,080
And since you chose to be a kept woman,

574
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,440
you did so contently.

575
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,600
Coming here now to seek death,

576
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,440
and who are you putting the show on for?

577
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,560
Men might like this act of yours.

578
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,480
But in this back courtyard,

579
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,800
who can't tell you're pretending to be feeble

580
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,000
to attack strongly to get your way?

581
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,000
Who can't tell your act of putting on

582
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,840
two different faces.

583
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,320
Miss.

584
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,960
Why do you slander me?

585
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:28,680
You're not the one

586
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,560
who is slandering us?

587
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,040
You come here

588
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,280
to force my sister

589
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,000
to accept someone

590
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,440
who is deemed ill-fit by the Gu House.

591
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,600
Through that, you throw my sister into being unfilial.

592
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,600
You disturb the Yu House

593
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,200
and cause a ruckus for others to gossip.

594
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,880
That's throwing my sister into appearing unjust.

595
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,000
You keep saying, "mistress and concubine".

596
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,120
That's ruining my sister's chastity.

597
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,200
You slander out of the blue,

598
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,520
and try to ruin my sister's life.

599
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,240
What great grudge do you hold

600
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,480
against the Yu House?

601
00:25:59,120 --> 00:25:59,600
And what great grudge

602
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,080
do you have against the Gu House?

603
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,320
Miss, that's not what this is about.

604
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,320
Shut that mouth.

605
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,360
Either you roll out of here yourself,

606
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,760
or they will bind you

607
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,560
and throw you out.

608
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,960
You choose one.

609
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,760
If it weren't for your

610
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,600
Sixth Miss's helping bravely,

611
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,160
my foolish granddaughter,

612
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,680
she'd have been eaten up

613
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,640
by that woman by now!

614
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,080
That girl was spoiled by me.

615
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,680
To be so oppressively in your home,

616
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,080
you should have beaten her out!

617
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,600
I hope she didn't ruin your family

618
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,720
and Gu House's marital prospect.

619
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,240
Gu House?

620
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,320
What's Gu House?

621
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,520
I've never heard of them.

622
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,360
My Yanran was long betrothed

623
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,680
to a boy in our hometown of Xuzhou

624
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,920
when their mothers

625
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,960
were carrying them.

626
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,760
But that boy

627
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,480
lost his mother a few years ago.

628
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,080
So Yanran's marriage has been

629
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,840
delayed in Bianjing.

630
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,280
Now, the boy's passed

631
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,520
the mourning period.

632
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,120
So in a few days,

633
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,680
my husband and I will

634
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,960
return to our hometown.

635
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,600
Watch them get married,

636
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,640
and I won't worry about it anymore.

637
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,160
These days,

638
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,640
how is the house-managing going?

639
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,040
Big Madam did a good job in managing,

640
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,960
so the ledgers are clear and balanced.

641
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,280
I am just following her policies as my predecessor.

642
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,480
Just doing

643
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,640
some usual things.

644
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,480
But I've learned a lot nevertheless.

645
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,520
You just managed the house for a few days

646
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,040
and you've got your temper instead.

647
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,000
You endure it here in your own courtyard,

648
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,840
but you go to another's house and sang a big tune.

649
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,400
You're right.

650
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,650
I was too overact.

651
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,800
You are sincere in acknowledging your mistake?

652
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,360
Actually, I am not.

653
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,080
Then tell me what you really think about.

654
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,760
I am thinking.

655
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,160
Somethings, they seem to be so demure

656
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,400
but they are treacherous in fact.

657
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,880
Somethings, they look so treacherous

658
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,960
but they are actually peaceful.

659
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,760
That woman.

660
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,320
She thought I was a Yu's daughter,

661
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,160
and we'll never meet again

662
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,080
so she can't accuse me.

663
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,640
That's the first point.

664
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,000
This matter is not a proud matter.

665
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,800
Yu House will not propagate about it.

666
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,080
They will keep it as a secret.

667
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,760
so I won't be exposed.

668
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,480
That is point two.

669
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,840
Imperial Tutor

670
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,360
is going to Xuzhou soon.

671
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,080
This matter will just be buried.

672
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:58,960
That is point three.

673
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,080
So I was able to

674
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,875
do it with courage.

675
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,520
In the end,

676
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,360
this is their own matter in Yu House,

677
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,120
but you showed up for her.

678
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,520
And if it gets known by outsiders,

679
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,475
you're a piece of mud

680
00:29:13,475 --> 00:29:14,760
trying to save a piece of gold,

681
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,720
only get yourself harmed.

682
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,600
I know this matter was harmful to me.

683
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,440
Though it is said that women

684
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,320
must be prudent with their words and conduct,

685
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,120
and they can only have a safe and sound life

686
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,320
if they do so.

687
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,040
But when I saw this matter,

688
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,760
I couldn't take it.

689
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,960
I can't just sit,

690
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,840
leisurely watching Sister Yu,

691
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,800
because she's too virtuous and too gentle,

692
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,000
gets pushed into a fire pit,

693
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,720
burning her alive to death.

694
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,240
That's not

695
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,320
how good people should end up.

696
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,760
You did not only stood up

697
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,440
for your Sister Yanran,

698
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,520
you were standing up for yourself too.

699
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,840
You were afraid in the future

700
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,280
you would meet the same thing

701
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,680
as what had happened to her.

702
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,825
Sister Yanran is a legitimate

703
00:30:01,825 --> 00:30:02,560
heiress of a noble house,

704
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,960
she still lives precariously.

705
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,960
And I'm...

706
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,920
As long as I am alive,

707
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,640
that day will never come!

708
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,000
Miss, Miss Yanran

709
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
is already far enough.

710
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,880
Let's go back.

711
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,640
Miss isn't happy.

712
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,880
Make her happier.

713
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,560
Miss, there's a shop

714
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,600
with a new snack.

715
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,800
They're honey-glazed pastry flowers.

716
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,200
I have never tried this.

717
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,240
Let's try it before we go home.

718
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,320
It's so good.

719
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,920
Are you coaxing the Miss to cheer up

720
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,840
or coaxing yourself?

721
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,880
If Miss is happy, I will be happy.

722
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,240
If Miss likes it, I will like it.

723
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,200
As long as it's food,

724
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,960
I've never seen you dislike it.

725
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,520
Miss,

726
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,080
those people in our room.

727
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:27,880
When can we

728
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,920
deal with them?

729
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,480
Let's wait a bit more.

730
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,520
You can only cook when the stove is hot.

731
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:35,925
The stove is cold still

732
00:31:35,925 --> 00:31:36,840
and even if you put the cauldron on,

733
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:37,960
you still

734
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,240
can't cook yellow millet.

735
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,400
I've helped your mother before.

736
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,000
I've still got the knee pads

737
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,200
you gifted me out of gratitude,

738
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,000
but I've never relied on the favor

739
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,200
to coerce a recompense.

740
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,840
It was entirely out of respect

741
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,640
to your brother and my friendship.

742
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,400
But you?

743
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,760
You repaid the favor with a grudge.

744
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,240
You disturbed my marital prospect

745
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,680
and ruined my match.

746
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,960
Why did you do that?

747
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,360
Go peel some lotus seeds.

748
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,800
We'll eat it on the way back.

749
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:11,800
Miss.

750
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,600
Go on.

751
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,320
So fierce.

752
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,680
Second Uncle asks me many questions,

753
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,840
and I'd like to ask you one as well.

754
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,400
Why are you trying

755
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,080
to marry the Eldest Miss from the Yu House?

756
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,760
You're a baby girl,

757
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,760
and why am I supposed to discuss with you?

758
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,840
I didn't know before either,

759
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,600
but that day,

760
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,800
after meeting your kept woman,

761
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:54,840
I became aware of everything clearly.

762
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,120
How can you understand?

763
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,320
Sister Yanran is amiable and gentle.

764
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,640
To have her as your proper wife,

765
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,080
your kept woman will be accepted.

766
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,800
Women aren't like you men.

767
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,160
Your world is wide,

768
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,040
free for you to soar and roam.

769
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,240
Our life is only limited

770
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,760
to a few things every day.

771
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,240
I thought it through a few times,

772
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,760
over and over.

773
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,840
If I can guess it too,

774
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,200
imagine the others.

775
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,760
Though my intention isn't pure,

776
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,680
I've still painstakingly made up my mind.

777
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,320
After I am married,

778
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,480
I will naturally behave myself.

779
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,120
I will live my life

780
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,280
peacefully with my main wife.

781
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:35,800
She and I

782
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,160
are both motherless.

783
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,560
If she can treat my kept woman kindly,

784
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,240
I will naturally not treat her ill either.

785
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,025
You're so young still, what do you understand?

786
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,880
When you're at the age of marriage talk,

787
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,600
you'll know then.

788
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:52,000
All the things in the world need to be weighed.

789
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,480
Old Madam Yu coughed up blood from anger even.

790
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,880
Do you even know that, Second Uncle?

791
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,600
What?

792
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,760
Imperial Tutor at first wouldn't consent to the marriage.

793
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:07,960
But for some unknown reason,

794
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,040
he suddenly changed his mind.

795
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,400
He was about to consent.

796
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,160
Did it never occur to you that

797
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,640
why in this,

798
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,400
favorable state,

799
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,400
your kept woman

800
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,960
would suddenly come to Yu House?

801
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,800
She was from a low birth

802
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,080
and she has always been feeble.

803
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:26,800
She was scared that

804
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,600
after I married an esteemed daughter of a noble house,

805
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,640
she would have no place to live

806
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,200
and of course, she would go and cry for a place.

807
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,440
Then how did she know

808
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,400
where Imperial Tutor's manor was?

809
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,800
She made the Old Madam

810
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,760
cough up blood,

811
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,760
and tried to force my Sister Yanran

812
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,120
to take her concubine tea!

813
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,480
Low birth might be true.

814
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,880
Always feeble, I don't think so.

815
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,960
I understand now.

816
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,480
People like you

817
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,200
all see her in this way.

818
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,480
And that's how you see me.

819
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,320
Second Uncle Gu!

820
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,000
You've saved me before

821
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,440
and I am very grateful.

822
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,200
I just want to give you a sincere reminder.

823
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,760
That kept woman of yours, Zhu Manniang.

824
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,240
I don't think she's a good person.

825
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,080
She went and cried her grievance at Yu House

826
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,080
So she's not a good person.

827
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,520
So you keep Qi Heng netted

828
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,520
and you're good?

829
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,760
What did you say?

830
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,240
Isn't it true though?

831
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,760
The Young Lord has you in his heart.

832
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,920
You can fool others maybe,

833
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,760
but not me.

834
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,275
You loosen your reins

835
00:35:33,275 --> 00:35:34,760
only to grasp them better.

836
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,160
You've got him strung to your hands

837
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,040
like a kite.

838
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,720
You pull on it, and he comes.

839
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,160
You loosen it, and he has to go.

840
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,560
A great man has been

841
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,600
totally controlled by you!

842
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,680
What? You speak nonsense!

843
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,000
He and I? We've not said an extra word,

844
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,240
never crossed any line.

845
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,480
You're filthy-minded

846
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,360
and you see people with filthy eyes.

847
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,400
In order to make your own life

848
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,600
much easier,

849
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,680
you went away and tried to ruin my Sister Yu.

850
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,600
And now you slander me!

851
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,160
If I had known it earlier.

852
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,440
I shouldn't have gone to

853
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,560
Yu House to harm Miss Yu.

854
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,560
I should've come to your

855
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,120
Sheng House to cause harm.

856
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,040
What do you mean by that?

857
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,640
What do I mean?

858
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,240
If I insist on marrying you,

859
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,320
Your father...

860
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,840
Wouldn't he marry you to me

861
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,840
and let me do whatever I want?

862
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,200
You dare?

863
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,280
Do you believe I will fight you to death?

864
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,840
Fight? With what?

865
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,640
The world has cliffs

866
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,680
and water to jump into.

867
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,800
Why can't I fight?

868
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,720
I'll be a Buddhist nun!

869
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,480
I'll be a Daoist nun!

870
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,960
I'll go to the Long area!

871
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,080
I'll farm with cattle and fields,

872
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,240
and I'll never marry you!

873
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,720
Shove it!

874
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,440
That gambling and

875
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,600
brothel-visiting rogue?

876
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,480
The kept woman even showed up here!

877
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,920
You want to marry Yanhong there?

878
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,120
You can get that idea?

879
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,920
No, I mean.

880
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,040
Wife. This,

881
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,760
you should think of it as this.

882
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,040
This Gu Tingye

883
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,000
is the legitimate heir of the Marquis house.

884
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,280
He has one elder brother

885
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,760
but he's always so sickly.

886
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,640
He might be done

887
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,480
at any time.

888
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,720
So this Gu Tingye might

889
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,280
inherit the noble title in the future.

890
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:19,920
Let's take a step back.

891
00:37:20,275 --> 00:37:21,400
Let's say that Gu Tingye

892
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,760
can't inherit the noble title.

893
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,480
He's got so many shops in his hands.

894
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,200
Hundreds of silver in profits.

895
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,800
Our Yanhong marries over

896
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,960
and she'll have prestige and honor.

897
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,080
You search through the capital

898
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,320
and how many people can compare to him?

899
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,840
Yancao,

900
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,960
is the work here alright?

901
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:48,480
Good.

902
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,680
Twenty-one taels of official silver.

903
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,040
Nanny Liu, please come and reweigh.

904
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,960
No need.

905
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,320
Miss Cuiwei

906
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,600
is the most capable.

907
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,280
Nanny Liu and Miss Caihuan

908
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,120
don't come often.

909
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,480
How about having a meal

910
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,440
with Miss Jiu'er today before you go?

911
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,120
I don't have that scope.

912
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,120
I need to go back

913
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,560
and respond to Big Madam.

914
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,200
Then let me escort you out.

915
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,560
No need.

916
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,800
You're busy.

917
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,440
I've been employed here for so long.

918
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,480
How can it be that

919
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,280
I don't know my way back?

920
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,680
This way.

921
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,120
Yes, and

922
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,600
Nanny Liu,

923
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,200
there's not much going on with Sixth Miss.

924
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,080
Mother,

925
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,240
can you just let me come back instead?

926
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,600
Go back and do what?

927
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,160
Just stay nice

928
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,880
and good by Sixth Miss.

929
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:39,640
Mother.

930
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,520
She's a blockhead

931
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,600
and has not much to see.

932
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,040
Let me come back.

933
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,720
Yinxing, Big Madam chose you to come.

934
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,160
If you don't try your hardest,

935
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,400
we'll try our hardest.

936
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,720
That Young Master Changbai

937
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,400
would come to visit Sixth Miss before.

938
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,400
He'd bring some

939
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,280
copybooks or ink sticks.

940
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,040
But nowadays,

941
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,440
he's stopped coming.

942
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,320
He thinks

943
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,280
Yinxing didn't serve well.

944
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,800
Sixth Miss didn't say anything

945
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,175
and just told Yinxing to apologize.

946
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,640
But later on, once,

947
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,680
Yinxing kept him

948
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,720
isolated in the yard.

949
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,760
I heard she asked him for a handkerchief

950
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,360
and joked with him.

951
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,600
That chit.

952
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,880
Bai'er and the daughter of Hai Family's

953
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,840
marriage is pending.

954
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,000
That whore is so delusional?

955
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,800
Who says she isn't.

956
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,960
Young Master didn't make a big deal out of respect

957
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,040
for Sixth Miss' prestige.

958
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,680
That Sixth Miss is such a weak bone.

959
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,120
She can't even

960
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:43,640
deal with that loser

961
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,800
and she wants to manage the house?

962
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,280
You ruined the marriage prospect

963
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,720
with Miss Yu.

964
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,775
Now they're having the Third Miss Yu

965
00:39:54,775 --> 00:39:55,560
to marry here.

966
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,720
I heard she was raised preciously as gold and jade.

967
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,560
She's very fierce and unyielding.

968
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,200
Whether you'll survive will

969
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,320
just depends on yourself now.

970
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,880
I am always carefully serving you.

971
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:12,880
I don't know

972
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,960
why you dislike me.

973
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,680
You can seduce men,

974
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,680
but you can't fool women

975
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,680
who make their living in the back courtyards.

976
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,240
We won't talk birth or family.

977
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,320
Do you even have the disposition of a legal wife?

978
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,440
I am of low birth.

979
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,200
But I still have to

980
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,080
live in this world.

981
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,440
Nanny. God gave me a life，

982
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,800
I can't just go die, right?

983
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,920
Where are you going?

984
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,760
I'm going out to buy some needles and thread.

985
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,560
Good then.

986
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,040
Mine are dull too.

987
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,120
I'll come with you.

988
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,240
Xiaocui!

989
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,880
Come to clear this.

990
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,360
Coming, Nanny!

991
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,840
Help me up.

992
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,320
You're going out?

993
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,880
Nanny says that you need to tell her

994
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,400
before going out.

995
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,200
Xiaocui, take it.

996
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,720
Xiaocui, you know I'll live longer than

997
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,160
Nanny in the end.

998
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,200
You give me a good future,

999
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,320
and you are giving

1000
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,920
yourself a good future too.

1001
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,840
In the future,

1002
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,440
working for the Third Miss Yu,

1003
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,960
our lives will be easier.
