00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,580
Episode 53

3
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,640
You're awake.

4
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,840
Why are you sleeping here?

5
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,120
Since like you don't

6
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,520
want me to sleep here.

7
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,960
No, you should get up now.

8
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,960
It isn't daybreak yet.

9
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,120
Let's sleep a little while more.

10
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,240
Regarding I...

11
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,960
taking in a concubine,

12
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,560
if you feel upset

13
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,880
about it,

14
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,760
just tell me.

15
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,440
It's nothing, really.

16
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,400
When I just entered your house

17
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,960
I didn't know your difficulties yet,

18
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,880
and I still didn't fully know

19
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,320
the situation of your house.

20
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,525
I was afraid that if there are too many people,

21
00:04:20,525 --> 00:04:21,360
it wouldn't be easy to control them.

22
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,720
Now,

23
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,720
I already know

24
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,880
the situation of this house.

25
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,960
Your paternal aunt directly told it to me,

26
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,525
and the eyes of the one

27
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:35,360
from the adjacent house is watching.

28
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,840
I can't make a mistake.

29
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,920
In anyway,

30
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,080
I know that you love me dearly.

31
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,200
You also had me manage the house, hence,

32
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,760
I must keep an eye of that Fengxian.

33
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,480
Once the situation is better,

34
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,600
I'll just drive her away.

35
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,320
How come I can't feel you

36
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,520
being jealous at all?

37
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,800
I'm not jealous.

38
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,760
Isn't that a good thing?

39
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,480
No.

40
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,040
I'm getting up.

41
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,120
The supervisor of the garden told me

42
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,360
that in 10 to 15 days,

43
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,480
the work in the garden will be over.

44
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,400
After counting it,

45
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,115
the work has been dragged for 2 months.

46
00:05:46,325 --> 00:05:47,565
If we drag it longer,

47
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,720
I'm afraid that outsiders will start to talk.

48
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,450
I'm thinking...

49
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,520
Once the work in the garden is done,

50
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,800
let's open the manor and set up a banquet.

51
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,480
And that will solve it.

52
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,960
You are the Big Madam of this house.

53
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,480
You have the final say.

54
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,720
That would be a big banquet.

55
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,800
All our close friends and families will come.

56
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,240
Marquis, you must make some time

57
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,360
to stay here and meet the guests.

58
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,120
Once you give out the news,

59
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,160
people will already come to visit our house.

60
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,160
Visit our house?

61
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,160
Yes.

62
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,925
Those who are unable to come

63
00:06:26,925 --> 00:06:28,240
during that day,

64
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,640
who don't want to come,

65
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,475
or afraid that coming will invite

66
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:32,000
too much attention

67
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,880
would come here to visit you

68
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,600
before the banquet.

69
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,120
That early?

70
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,800
If it's a hot furnace,

71
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,200
even if it's the sixth month of the year,

72
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,120
someone would still rush here to get burned.

73
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,360
You are indeed wise.

74
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,440
I'm afraid that...

75
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,080
I'm afraid that the fire might get too strong,

76
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,160
and cause the furnace will collapse.

77
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,840
Indeed.

78
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,720
Hence, you must guard this furnace well.

79
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,480
You can't just let anyone put in a fire wood.

80
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,360
War is an extension of the government.

81
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,375
A banquet about merging of houses

82
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:22,360
is also an extension of the government.

83
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,280
You must be more careful.

84
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,320
You must be more careful.

85
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,680
Now,

86
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,200
we are in one furnace.

87
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,000
Let's both be careful.

88
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You decide about the merging banquet.

89
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,800
You must be careful

90
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,080
with those people from the adjacent manor.

91
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,360
I know.

92
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,480
My parents were not benevolent when I was little.

93
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,680
You know this.

94
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,160
Although my father

95
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,040
was harsh on me,

96
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,480
no matter he loved

97
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,400
or hated me,

98
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,840
they were real feelings.

99
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,800
Unlike that stepmother of mine

100
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,920
who was just putting on a mask.

101
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,080
But how come I'm not as fierce to my stepmother

102
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,680
compared to

103
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,480
how I treated my father?

104
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,400
Do you know why?

105
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,040
Because stepmother is an outsider.

106
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,280
Indeed.

107
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,480
My father remarried

108
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,120
and had my stepmother.

109
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,720
When she had her own child,

110
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,200
I became an eyesore to her.

111
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,280
I'm affecting their future,

112
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,960
hence, she wishes that I die soon.

113
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,760
She's so hateful,

114
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,280
but since I know

115
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,200
that she's an outsider,

116
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,920
I didn't feel

117
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,800
that much pain.

118
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,880
But the old marquis

119
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,160
is your biological father.

120
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,440
Yes.

121
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,880
Since I was little,

122
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,200
my father was my sky.

123
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,520
He was like a sky deity.

124
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,640
I respected and loved him.

125
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,520
No matter how he treated me,

126
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,240
I'd always bear some hope towards him.

127
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,200
I felt that one day,

128
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,760
he would understand me.

129
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,320
But until the end,

130
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,240
when my hope

131
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,560
completely shattered,

132
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,320
I felt so much pain,

133
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,080
because I feel

134
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,680
that he naturally should love me.

135
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,920
I understand.

136
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,600
You don't.

137
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,320
You are my wife.

138
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,440
I understand.

139
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,960
Although I treat you like the earth

140
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,000
looking up into the sky,

141
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,160
a star looking at that moon,

142
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,080
I respect and love you.

143
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,680
Let's just eat.

144
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,920
Did I say something wrong?

145
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,240
You still don't get it!

146
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,240
Shitou!

147
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:35,825
Marquis!

148
00:10:35,825 --> 00:10:37,080
You're going to the morning court this early?

149
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,160
Early? It's already late!

150
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,360
What's wrong with Marquis?

151
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,840
He seems unhappy?

152
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,360
He has been weird since yesterday.

153
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,160
Maybe, there are so many things

154
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,360
to worry in the imperial court.

155
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,280
Shitou brought you some food again?

156
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,480
Fried cherries from Nanbei Shop.

157
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,400
Big Madam, have a taste.

158
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,560
This is from Nanbei Shop?

159
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,000
Yes.

160
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,600
Not bad.

161
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,800
The ones from Nanbei Shop are delicious.

162
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,200
That's right!

163
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,000
The work in the garden would be over soon.

164
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,450
We would be setting up a banquet

165
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,040
to entertain some guests.

166
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,600
This desert is nice.

167
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,280
Tell the Desert Section to buy some

168
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,400
and set it up during that day.

169
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,680
Okay! Okay!

170
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,480
That flaky crab apple flower

171
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,680
last time was good too.

172
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,600
Add that too.

173
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,240
That's right! That's right!

174
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,280
Yancao! Yancao!

175
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:46,825
Quickly come here.

176
00:11:46,825 --> 00:11:47,760
There are a lot of people today!

177
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,840
Serve these dishes to the front.

178
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,040
Danju!

179
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,540
Put them according to kind.

180
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,840
Sister-in-law, slowly.

181
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,360
Come. Come.

182
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,760
Good rascal.

183
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,560
Merging these two mansions

184
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,760
really made it so huge.

185
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,800
What's the use of being huge?

186
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,960
Good thing, we just renovated the garden.

187
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,520
Sister-in-law, take a good look at it.

188
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,040
Crude men like us

189
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,320
don't really know refined things.

190
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,640
Sister-in-law,

191
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,640
look and tell me

192
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,680
if there are anything you don't like.

193
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,200
The mason hasn't left yet.

194
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,560
Marquis, you're being too courteous.

195
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,640
Was it your wife

196
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,640
who handled all the renovations?

197
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,080
She did them all.

198
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,320
What do I know?

199
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,920
Come. Come.

200
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,800
Make way!

201
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,360
Please look at where you're going!

202
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,200
A carriage from your manor.

203
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,680
Husband, greetings!

204
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,560
This one must be

205
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,150
the Marquis Gu that older sister

206
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:15,560
frequently mentioned

207
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,240
when she was still alive. Am I right?

208
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,960
Greetings, Marquis.

209
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,280
Congratulations on the merging of your houses!

210
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,150
This is the Third Little Sister

211
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,800
of my deceased wife.

212
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,800
She got taken in as my concubine a few days ago.

213
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,325
Since General already

214
00:13:31,325 --> 00:13:32,800
has a concubine to serve you,

215
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,800
forgive me for going home to rest then.

216
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,400
Sister-in-law, don't.

217
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,640
Sister, just feel free to go back.

218
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,920
I surely will attend to husband well.

219
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,040
You really want me to go back,

220
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,600
but why must I leave?

221
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,320
I'm not the one who's embarrassing myself here.

222
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,280
Sister,

223
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,680
don't blame husband for this.

224
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,320
It was me who

225
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,080
insisted on coming after seeing the invitation.

226
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,720
Wife!

227
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,800
What's going on here?

228
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,240
You're slapping the face of the Zhang family here.

229
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,400
In an official banquet,

230
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,840
you've brought a concubine?

231
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,560
This is against etiquette.

232
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,275
Fifth was afraid that

233
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:23,320
her pregnancy might get unstable,

234
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,960
hence, she especially asked me to apologize to you

235
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,120
for she can't come anymore.

236
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,320
And Changbai

237
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,280
went to attend to his duties

238
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,800
in Hanlin Academy.

239
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,400
He said that your husband knows that

240
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,920
he doesn't like events like this,

241
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:36,850
hence, he especially didn't

242
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:37,440
send him any invitation.

243
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,760
Really so considerate.

244
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,160
When they get together,

245
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,600
they would have endless talks.

246
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,320
Yes.

247
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,360
Congratulations. Congratulations.

248
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:45,920
Thanks.

249
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,360
How come you invited her too?

250
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,360
There were originally two invitations.

251
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,720
One is for Countess Wu.

252
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,330
The one is for Fourth Brother-in-law.

253
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,640
But when my messenger arrived in their manor,

254
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,800
they said that Fourth Brother-in-law

255
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,750
accompanied Countess Wu

256
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,520
to Luzhou to buy paintings.

257
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,280
The invitations then didn't reach them.

258
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,760
I'm sure you calculated the days well

259
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,840
before sending the invitations.

260
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,840
A few days ago,

261
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,675
my marquis husband especially

262
00:15:15,675 --> 00:15:16,840
told Fourth Brother-in-law

263
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,400
that the painting that Countess Wu wants

264
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,360
is in Luzhou.

265
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,760
You husband and wife

266
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,520
did it deliberately.

267
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,400
But the next day,

268
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,000
my mother-in-law sent an invitation

269
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,000
to that Fourth Sister of mine.

270
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,560
Your mother-in-law

271
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,560
is quite famous.

272
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,800
She's quite powerful

273
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,200
among the wives of nobility.

274
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:38,800
I remember that

275
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,320
when Count Yan's house did a separation of assets,

276
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
she was even especially invited to be a judge.

277
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,280
Good thing, she's only a stepmother.

278
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,800
Or else, your days

279
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,320
would be harder than mine.

280
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,240
Yes.

281
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,120
If not, their family wouldn't have any decision

282
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,000
on this asset separation matter.

283
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,043
No such thing.

284
00:15:58,043 --> 00:15:59,440
I'm not that resolute.

285
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,520
Since the Kang Family entered the capital,

286
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,920
I had to return home every 3 to 5 days,

287
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,680
Once I came home

288
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,640
and I would always see auntie

289
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,760
being a guest in our house.

290
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,250
Big Madam and her sister

291
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,000
have a close relationship.

292
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,160
It's not surprising.

293
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,520
Have you forgotten

294
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,320
how she criticized you?

295
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,760
Or else, what must I do?

296
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,080
They just gave me undeserved doting

297
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,920
and asked me to be their witness.

298
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,160
It was quite a harmonious event.

299
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,160
They discussed things

300
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,800
and settled the matter quickly.

301
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,520
I was just...

302
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,240
a freeloader for 2 days.

303
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,600
Steward Ge said

304
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,040
that the kitchen is ready.

305
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,825
Just give the instructions

306
00:16:45,825 --> 00:16:46,600
and the meals can be served.

307
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,960
It's just that Grand Madam's servants

308
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,760
have tried to peek numerous times,

309
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,840
but they were stopped every time.

310
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,120
I'm afraid that they might cause problems.

311
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,320
Tell our different house sections and departments

312
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,000
to inform the stewards of the different section

313
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,480
and departments of the other manor

314
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,200
that today is just an act.

315
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,120
that today is just an act.

316
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,300
After we're done with it,

317
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,600
everyone can have a good rest.

318
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,760
We surely will return to them

319
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,360
the management of this manor.

320
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,440
Yes.

321
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,000
Little Sister, I'll get going now.

322
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,960
You can keep doing your own thing.

323
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,880
Mother.

324
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,840
I'll just leave for a while.

325
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,640
What's wrong?

326
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,080
Mother, look at you.

327
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,720
How could you stay with them

328
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,320
and talk so intimately?

329
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,575
Congratulations Auntie

330
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:56,720
in the merging of your manors!

331
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,640
With the event being this huge,

332
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,360
I'm afraid that you'll get exhausted.

333
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,080
Don't be so courteous.

334
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,160
Forgive me for having a poor sight.

335
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,720
You are...

336
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,120
This is Madam Shen.

337
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,480
She's the wife of the young lord

338
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,920
of the ducal house of Duke Qi of the State.

339
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,360
Before,

340
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,200
I've seen you from afar during the funeral

341
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,920
of Marquis Yu.

342
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,480
I'm afraid that you were handling so much things then,

343
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,920
hence, you didn't see me.

344
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,800
So, you're from the House of Princess

345
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,400
of the Second Rank.

346
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,240
Although our two houses are relatives,

347
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,720
it's already beyond the 5th degree.

348
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,640
No need to call me auntie.

349
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,400
Addressing me that

350
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,400
is really embarrassing me.

351
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,320
Please come in and sit.

352
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,500
I heard that you love to joke around

353
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,200
since you were little.

354
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,475
Hearing them would make people

355
00:18:50,475 --> 00:18:51,360
feel having a breath of fresh air,

356
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,400
and unable to contain one's joy.

357
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,760
But I'm quite a useless person.

358
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,200
My husband kept being depressed and unhappy.

359
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,360
However,

360
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,520
I don't know how to advice him.

361
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,320
Madam,

362
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,720
Fifth Madam

363
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,560
was calling us earlier.

364
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,600
There's no Fifth Madam over there.

365
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,520
Men aspire to travel far and leave their mark.

366
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:22,725
Heng'er is currently

367
00:19:22,725 --> 00:19:23,640
at the stage of repaying his country

368
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,160
with service and seeking to improve himself.

369
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,520
Although I'm a woman,

370
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,600
I know that there are so much affairs to handle

371
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,880
in the imperial court.

372
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,200
Heng'er is just worried about government matters.

373
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,200
It's a good diligent act.

374
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,920
He can't really play butterflies with you

375
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,920
or draw your eyebrow make up everyday, right?

376
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,160
With you two respecting and loving each other;

377
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,050
your family being united, prosperous,

378
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:44,480
and without problems;

379
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,360
that is the best kind of proper path.

380
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,640
Am I right, my niece-in-law?

381
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,160
Right.

382
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,480
If you kids are living a good life,

383
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,520
elders like us

384
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,760
will be at ease.

385
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,520
Auntie, you said it right.

386
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,040
But how could my husband compare to that of uncle?

387
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,320
He's now highly very popular and powerful,

388
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,400
like he's riding his horse during springtime.

389
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,120
Look at the number of people in this event.

390
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,875
Second Uncle's official fortune

391
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:24,520
is going so smoothly.

392
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,860
You have also been conferred a title.

393
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,680
As they say,

394
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,825
a full moon would start to wane,

395
00:20:31,825 --> 00:20:33,320
a water filled jar would start to overflow.

396
00:20:33,825 --> 00:20:34,800
Uncle and Auntie are currently

397
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,560
like the high noon sky.

398
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,000
You two must be careful.

399
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,200
Since Fourth Sister tried to socialize with you,

400
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,120
she surely have told you

401
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,120
a lot about my matter.

402
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,320
Auntie, you are the gentlest and most refined.

403
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,320
Everyone says that

404
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,125
marrying into the marquis manor for me

405
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,040
is climbing a higher branch.

406
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,720
Just today,

407
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,320
in a few short hours,

408
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,875
there were already 7 to 8 noble wives

409
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:12,360
who told me that

410
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,080
I was fortunate.

411
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,680
But who knew that in this manor,

412
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,480
I had to first send away

413
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,520
all those concubines

414
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,440
that had been idle here for a long time.

415
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,240
Also,

416
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,400
take care of the only child

417
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,600
that was left by a ferocious outside mistress.

418
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,640
Second, I must handle

419
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,360
this stepmom with such good outside reputation.

420
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,000
Inside this manor,

421
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,475
there are also wicked servants

422
00:21:38,475 --> 00:21:39,240
who would bully their master,

423
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:39,875
and farmsteads

424
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:40,880
who tampered their accounting books.

425
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,560
I'm just an illegitimate daughter.

426
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,200
I have no one to rely on.

427
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,720
When I entered this manor,

428
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,840
it was also hard for me to walk by a step.

429
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,880
Tell me, if I'm unable to leave all those behind,

430
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,280
I would be dying from problems in living my days.

431
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,200
I also heard from mother-in-law

432
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,440
that the marquis manor isn't that peaceful.

433
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,520
In this world,

434
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,550
the required standards on women w

435
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,480
as placed too high.

436
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,680
If women like us would still

437
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,320
make things difficult for ourselves,

438
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,160
we indeed won't be able to

439
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,720
continue living our days anymore.

440
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,080
Madam,

441
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,450
don't you think that you're telling me

442
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,040
too intimate matters

443
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,040
despite our shallow relationship?

444
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,920
A lot of problems

445
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,825
are created by shallow talks d

446
00:22:31,825 --> 00:22:32,840
espite having a deep relationship.

447
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,240
Let us

448
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,880
be frank with each other now,

449
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,925
so we can at least have a level

450
00:22:37,925 --> 00:22:38,800
of expectation for each other.

451
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,400
In the future,

452
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,720
there then won't be any disappointments.

453
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,160
Be frank?

454
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,400
What if after being frank,

455
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,350
you get up from

456
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,320
your dream and fantasy?

457
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,240
Tell the chief steward

458
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,050
to add two more tables for the

459
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,040
male guests in the western courtyard.

460
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,160
Tell the ushers to pay more attention.

461
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,600
Don't let Glorious Grand Master Liu

462
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,300
and Lord Gao of the Imperial College

463
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,000
sit in the same table.

464
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,880
The two families just got involved in a lawsuit

465
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,400
a few days ago.

466
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,960
Don't embarrassed them.

467
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,640
Yes.

468
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,040
She won't be able to handle everything by herself.

469
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,040
You two go help her.

470
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,120
Big Madam, let's go rest.

471
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,960
I'll go ask for a bowl of tofu pudding

472
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,080
to quench your thirst.

473
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,000
Xiaotao.

474
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,400
You.

475
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,080
You...

476
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,280
Go and look for Young Lord Qi.

477
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,120
Young Lord Qi?

478
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,360
Tell him that that I want to talk him.

479
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,275
Let him wait for me

480
00:23:54,275 --> 00:23:55,320
at the western corridor bridge.

481
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,120
Miss, this doesn't look appropriate.

482
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,320
He already

483
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,080
escalated the matter to his wife.

484
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,680
If I still stay vague,

485
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,720
I'm afraid that a major problem will happen.

486
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,960
Don't worry. I know my limits.

487
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,840
Little Sister Kang,

488
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,640
that was really interesting.

489
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,320
So lively.

490
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,000
How come this fried cherry of yours

491
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,360
taste different?

492
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,080
Old Sister, don't talk about that anymore.

493
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,360
Just put it down and don't eat it.

494
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,560
Why?

495
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,640
That Second Daughter-in-law of mine said that

496
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,640
I'm old and was afraid that I'll get tired.

497
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:41,850
She then took over

498
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,000
the organization of this banquet.

499
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,080
Don't know which shop in the streets

500
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,280
she had

501
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,000
these fried cherries made.

502
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,720
Anyway,

503
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,200
it's not anymore that one

504
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,040
we usually buy fried sweets from.

505
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,240
Now, in this house,

506
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,360
I'm not the one

507
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,800
who decides anymore.

508
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,760
If you find any fault

509
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,920
in this banquet,

510
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,040
please

511
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,960
just give me respect

512
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,240
and be more tolerant.

513
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,000
For an illegitimate daughter like her

514
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,400
to marry into your marquis manor

515
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,280
is already great fortune.

516
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,960
How could she still be so unruly

517
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,760
and make senseless dins like this?

518
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,080
You are really too kind.

519
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,600
You're too kind to others.

520
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,720
You're indulging them to the point that

521
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,040
they are disregarding natural morality.

522
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,040
I'm old and I've lost my support.

523
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,975
It's now this second daughter-in-law of mine

524
00:25:24,975 --> 00:25:26,000
who's in-charge of our manor.

525
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,480
I also get to be idle,

526
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,760
while she indeed need to learn by experience.

527
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,800
Your Second loves

528
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,000
his wife so much,

529
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,025
and is currently the right hand man

530
00:25:36,025 --> 00:25:36,720
of the emperor.

531
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,360
My sister-in-law

532
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,760
is really regretting it.

533
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,720
If she knew that

534
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,080
he'll change his ways in such nimble manner,

535
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,360
she would have married off

536
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,640
that niece of mine to him.

537
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,760
She then wouldn't be coming home every 3 to 5 days

538
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,500
to complain to her mother

539
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,440
how her husband is a scoundrel.

540
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,720
It's not

541
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,520
that I'm being talkative.

542
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,920
If your niece did marry into this house,

543
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,360
she might not have days as great as

544
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,600
that of her current daughter-in-law.

545
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,640
What do you mean?

546
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,720
My niece

547
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,480
lost her mother ever since she was little.

548
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,800
That biological little sister of mine

549
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,950
who was the legitimate wife initially

550
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:15,880
wanted to raise her by herself.

551
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,880
But never thought that

552
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,160
child didn't want her,

553
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,360
and just turned around

554
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,600
to run towards

555
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,600
the room of the Old Madam.

556
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,520
With such agility,

557
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,725
even the cavalry army of the Qidan Ethnic Tribe

558
00:26:27,725 --> 00:26:28,240
can't catch her.

559
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,440
She's really so rebellious.

560
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,080
Whenever I go to the Sheng Manor,

561
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,960
this illegitimate daughter

562
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,720
would act in a legitimate daughter manner.

563
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,120
Her other sisters all can't dare to offend her.

564
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,560
I also was just too talkative

565
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,080
and scolded her a little.

566
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,000
Never thought that

567
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,800
she would turn hostile against me.

568
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,040
I was thinking that

569
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,920
someone should stand up and discipline her, right?

570
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,800
After getting on the good side of her grandmother,

571
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,450
she was able to obtain the house key

572
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:57,320
and manage the house.

573
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:58,950
She was even able to become superior

574
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:59,560
to my biological little sister,

575
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,120
the main madam of their house.

576
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,000
I'm old.

577
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,260
I'm unable to support this family anymore.

578
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,160
I also get to have some quiet and peaceful time.

579
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,800
But just for some quiet times,

580
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,880
if you keep on yielding,

581
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,480
your future days

582
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,600
would just be harder.

583
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,360
Niece,

584
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,320
you're an only daughter of Duke Ying of the State.

585
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,240
How could you understand the difficulties

586
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,320
of being a stepmother?

587
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,320
Now that the old marquis is gone,

588
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,640
Eldest has also died,

589
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,560
Second inherited the nobility title,

590
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,640
and I'm not his birth mother.

591
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,080
Everything I say is wrong.

592
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,280
Everything I do is a hindrance.

593
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,040
Forget it. Forget it.

594
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,600
How come the wife of Eldest, Madam Shao,

595
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,720
didn't come out today?

596
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,400
With the temper of that wife of Second,

597
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,160
and the fact that she's used to being in charge,

598
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,560
has really scared the wife of Eldest.

599
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,640
She developed some qi deficiency and palpitations.

600
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,125
I then just asked her to rest more

601
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:08,880
in the inner courtyard,

602
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,680
so she won't get scared again if she comes out.

603
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,720
The more you all stay weak,

604
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,200
won't she get more domineering?

605
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,600
Does my dynasty not have

606
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,800
any laws anymore?!

607
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,800
Forget it. Forget it.

608
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,040
I've already lived half of my life.

609
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,720
As long as I endure these grievances,

610
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,120
Eldest's wife

611
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,600
and his daughter

612
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,960
can then have better days.

613
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,720
If she dares to provoke me,

614
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,600
I surely will spit on her.

615
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,400
Sixth Little Sister.

616
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,760
Greeting, Young Lord.

617
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:09,960
How about...

618
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,960
you just call me Yuanruo?

619
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,000
I risked the destruction

620
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,360
of my reputation

621
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,520
to have you come here for a talk,

622
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,920
and not really to reminisce about our past.

623
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,160
As long as it's you who's calling,

624
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,320
It's all right.

625
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,000
I think the Gu Family and Qi Family

626
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,560
are technically relatives.

627
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,400
Although it's long been beyond the fifth degree,

628
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,280
you should still

629
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,680
be calling us

630
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,800
uncle and auntie.

631
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,360
What do you mean?

632
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,160
You also addressed my marquis husband

633
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,960
as second uncle before.

634
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,600
You want me to call you...

635
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,160
You want me...

636
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,440
In terms of seniority,

637
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,880
I count as your elder.

638
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,520
You're so cruel.

639
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,440
How come I can't see Big Madam anywhere?

640
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,680
I also can't see Xiaotao.

641
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,720
Those madams have turned into powerful monsters

642
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,960
after years of experience.

643
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,960
They surely won't any good for Minglan.

644
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,320
Go search for her

645
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,400
and don't let her get bullied.

646
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,500
Okay. I'll go right away.

647
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,720
Everyone is saying

648
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,280
that I'm living a good life now.

649
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,280
That I've fallen into a jar of honey.

650
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,525
There are even people saying

651
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,680
that an illegitimate daughter like me

652
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,440
getting raised by my grandmother

653
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,750
is because my birth mother lighted

654
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:05,560
high incenses to the deities before.

655
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,480
But I'm willing to abandon

656
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,600
these luxurious life.

657
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,160
What nobility title and carriage,

658
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,080
conferred title and mansions?

659
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,600
I'm willing to use all of these

660
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,960
in exchange for my mother's life.

661
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,920
As long as she can be revived,

662
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,920
I'm willing to stay forever

663
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:22,960
in that narrow room

664
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,080
in the Sheng Manor.

665
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,480
I'm fine with not having any good food or clothes,

666
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,280
having no charcoal fire,

667
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,280
as long as

668
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,880
she can come back.

669
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,760
As long as I'm allowed

670
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,760
to sleep on her lap again,

671
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,040
I'm willing to do anything.

672
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,440
I know.

673
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,480
I understand everything.

674
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,480
You don't.

675
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,360
My mother will never return.

676
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,800
She can't come back anymore.

677
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,640
She can't resurrect.

678
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,120
No matter what I do,

679
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,720
it's impossible that she'll be back.

680
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,320
I still have a lot of days to live.

681
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,640
When a person dies, he can't resurrect.

682
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,600
When time passes,

683
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,040
it will also never come back.

684
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,800
Young Lord,

685
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,400
we're both already married to other people.

686
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,640
We can never turn around anymore.

687
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,040
Yancao!

688
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,480
Have you seen our Madam?

689
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,720
I didn't.

690
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,520
Go. Go.

691
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,080
How come I can't see

692
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,760
my Sixth Little Sister?

693
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,720
I saw her going to the the courtyard

694
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,240
in the west.

695
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,000
That courtyard

696
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,640
is cold, remote, and has only a few people.

697
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,360
She must have went there to rest.

698
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,640
How about

699
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,560
I go call her in your behalf?

700
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,760
Forget it.

701
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,640
I'm sure that she's tired

702
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,480
in organizing such a huge event.

703
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,920
I'll go look for Eldest Sister for a chat instead.

704
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,080
Yes.

705
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,280
Young Master.

706
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,440
I heard from the servant of Molan

707
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,920
that Big Madam is resting

708
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,760
in the western courtyard.

709
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,200
She must be tired.

710
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,320
I'll go check on her.

711
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,560
You heard these words from Molan?

712
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,920
Right. Molan said them.

713
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,240
I am regretting it everyday!

714
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,800
I would gather 3 to 5 things to do

715
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,120
at the same time.

716
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,720
I dare not stop.

717
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,960
Because if I stop,

718
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,440
I would think...

719
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,320
why?

720
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,200
How come

721
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,320
when my family were against it,

722
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,040
I couldn't have worked harder?

723
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:12,880
How come

724
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,575
I must wait until I passed

725
00:34:13,575 --> 00:34:14,200
the imperial examination

726
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,520
before I went to your house to propose marriage?

727
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,760
Why did I...

728
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,360
Why must I...

729
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,300
show off

730
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:28,750
and earn the liking of

731
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:29,440
that Princess of the third rank?

732
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,360
I also hate.

733
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,800
I hate Prince Yong and his family!

734
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,520
They were tyrannical and overbearing.

735
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,840
They took my father as hostage.

736
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,280
Young Lord,

737
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,280
what happened between us

738
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,240
is that the heaven made fools of us.

739
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,240
Sixth Little Sister,

740
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,200
it's good that you understand.

741
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,400
Only you can understand.

742
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,480
I...

743
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,400
I was just afraid...

744
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,400
afraid that you'll hate

745
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,840
and bear grudges against me.

746
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,160
I have never hated

747
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,240
or bore grudges against you.

748
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,040
I know that it wasn't easy for you.

749
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,720
I understand.

750
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,480
Why?

751
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,880
Why did you not hate me?

752
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,720
Why would I?

753
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,860
As a son,

754
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,640
of course

755
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,960
you must think for the sake of your parents.

756
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,600
Moreover,

757
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,200
you also didn't know that in the future,

758
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,000
there would be a huge change

759
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,625
in the palace situation,

760
00:36:02,625 --> 00:36:03,560
that Prince Yong would get killed.

761
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,520
At that time,

762
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,880
you were left with no choice.

763
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,200
I knew it.

764
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,320
No, you...

765
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,200
You... should hate me.

766
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,040
You should hate me.

767
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,840
Young Lord,

768
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,480
if we keep looking back

769
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,840
all our life,

770
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,480
we won't be able to live our days.

771
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,880
I met your wife today.

772
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,120
I also can see

773
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,480
how much she treasures

774
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,200
and loves you.

775
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,520
I also cherish

776
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,680
my present life.

777
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,880
My marquis husband treas me very well.

778
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,240
Have you ever loved

779
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,440
that Marquis Gu?!

780
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,520
Was he ever like me,

781
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,450
not sleeping throughout the night

782
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:52,000
in thinking about you?

783
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,480
Have you ever missed him like that?

784
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,400
have you ever cried so hard

785
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,120
while thinking

786
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,200
about him?

787
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,920
No, you never!

788
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,760
You ne—

789
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,400
I also didn't cry

790
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,560
bitter tears for you.

791
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,325
You kept filing complaints about him

792
00:37:28,325 --> 00:37:28,880
in the morning court.

793
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,840
Have you thought about my feelings?

794
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,200
Good thing, he's a sensible person.

795
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,200
If he's an unreasonable oppressive person,

796
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,080
how could I live my life?

797
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,040
Have you thought about those?

798
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,440
Yes,

799
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,800
you are the treasure of your Qi Family.

800
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,040
You can do whatever you want.

801
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,960
But I'm just alone.

802
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,440
I must live my future days hers

803
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,000
in the marquis manor.

804
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:53,840
Are you really doing it

805
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,960
just to vent your anger

806
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,960
or for me?

807
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,200
Have you really thought about it well?

808
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,520
I...

809
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,720
Of course, I'm doing all of these

810
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,040
so you can live a better life.

811
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:10,920
But it has to be me

812
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,800
who says what's good for me.

813
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,920
What you think doesn't count.

814
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,300
But it's also not important

815
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,120
if it counts or not now.

816
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,280
All of these have ended long ago.

817
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,880
Only you are refusing to let go.

818
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,480
That Young Lord,

819
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,880
even he's now a scholarly official

820
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,960
and has joined the morning court,

821
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,520
his temper and character

822
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,160
are still so child-like.

823
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,840
Just doing whatever he thinks.

824
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,150
I said that I don't hate

825
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,560
nor bear any grudges against him,

826
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,040
yet he instead got angrier.

827
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,880
Could it be he wants me to hate him?

828
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,960
Bear grudges against him?

829
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,120
I saw Young Lord getting very upset

830
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:25,960
near the end of your conversation.

831
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,400
I also know that he's in pain.

832
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,360
But if he keeps being this hesitant

833
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,280
and keeps procrastinating,

834
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,480
does he want to be buried

835
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,640
with all these

836
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,480
past affairs?

837
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,200
Scolding him earlier,

838
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,000
waking him up earlier,

839
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,120
would be beneficial

840
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,840
for him, for the Qi family

841
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,840
and for his wife.

842
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,200
What about Marquis?

843
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:47,315
Marquis?

844
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,400
that would be good for Marquis already.

845
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,720
If it's good for him,

846
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,520
then it's good for me.

847
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,280
Our future days

848
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,275
can then be lived in a more peaceful

849
00:39:56,275 --> 00:39:56,760
and steadier manner.

850
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,280
The sky has already changed.

851
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,480
A concubine dared to attend a banquet like this.

852
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,040
What could people from a poor and desolate place

853
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,000
like Yuzhou know?

854
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,680
Only they can be so shameless

855
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,640
as to let concubines come in an event like this.

856
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,560
Lower down your voice.

857
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,960
That group of people there is all from Yuzhou.

858
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,240
So what?

859
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,120
After all,

860
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,400
Bianjing is still the capital of this empire.

861
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,240
It's not Yuzhou.

862
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,560
Madam Shen, you're here quite early.

863
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,680
Is General Zheng already here?

864
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,760
Let's continue playing.

865
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,480
I won't play this with you anymore.

866
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,440
Let me tell a joke.

867
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,325
Didn't that Zhang woman married

868
00:40:51,325 --> 00:40:52,320
into the Shen family

869
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,760
for more than half a year now?

870
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,800
But I've never seen them

871
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,160
sleeping together that often.

872
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,120
And she still want to get pregnant?

873
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,720
Totally dreaming!

874
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,240
Yes.

875
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,040
You lowly wife,

876
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,600
you dare to slander your legitimate main madam?

877
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,000
What are you doing?

878
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,240
Who do you think you are?!

879
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,560
You dare pull on my Miss?!

880
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,160
You!

881
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,040
Nanny Fen!

882
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,840
Sister-in-law.

883
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,440
What did you say earlier?

884
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,840
Big Madam.

885
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,760
I didn't say much earlier.

886
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,680
We were just guessing

887
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,760
if you know to say our Yuzhou dialect,

888
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,200
if you've drank our wine.

889
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,840
Our Yuzhou

890
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,840
have large herrings and mulberry forests.

891
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,900
Too bad, the lands are barren

892
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,120
and the weather is cold.

893
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,280
We only have low-quality silk there.

894
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,600
Remotely poor and desolate.

895
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,600
Shut up.

896
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,120
Correct. Remotely poor and desolate.

897
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,760
But people like us

898
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,440
grew up wearing things

899
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,440
like that.

900
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,760
Not only them,

901
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,080
even the biological sister of General,

902
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,160
me, my sister,

903
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,640
General himself,

904
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,160
and the present Empress.

905
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,760
Big Madam, you were born here in Bianjing.

906
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,480
You were born in a nest of good fortune.

907
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,880
You don't know anything.

908
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,000
Only I know

909
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,680
how to make the favorite flaky pastry of General.

910
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,360
Only I know

911
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,160
about the home town of General.

912
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,240
Enough, stop saying.

913
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,000
You are just a vixen.

914
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,480
Who are you calling a vixen?!

915
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,120
Sister-in-law.

916
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:35,920
Say that once again! Say it once again!

917
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,760
What are you saying?

918
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,760
Say that again!

919
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,520
When the event become bigger,

920
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,720
it can't be avoid that

921
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,120
some people to have debts

922
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,280
of gratitude with each other.

923
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,240
Those from Yuzhou and Bianjing

924
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,040
are both people that can't be offended.

925
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,920
If one's house can't secure its footing,

926
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,680
this banquet would really embarrassing.
