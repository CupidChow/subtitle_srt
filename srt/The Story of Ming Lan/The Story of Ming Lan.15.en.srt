00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,982
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,936
Episode 15

3
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,400
Big Madam's older sister

4
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,743
is Wang Kang.

5
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,280
The children call her "Aunt".

6
00:01:18,517 --> 00:01:19,677
Every time she comes,

7
00:01:20,152 --> 00:01:22,117
she urges Big Madam to do something.

8
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,800
She should come less often.

9
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,280
Mistress Lin is selling farmland secretly,

10
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,300
that's also a conduct ruining the family.

11
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,560
Currently, we really have

12
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,840
no one in the inner quarters

13
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,880
who can handle the big task of managing the house.

14
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,440
I don't have any solutions.

15
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,720
That's why I'm here to seek your guidance.

16
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,280
Are you thinking of letting me manage this?

17
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,040
It'd be great naturally if you could.

18
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,040
But I fear it will only cause you a lot of work.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,960
Perhaps

20
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,680
you want me to be the evil person

21
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,840
and choose one between

22
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,120
Big Madam and Mistress Lin?

23
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,160
And I then carry the blame?

24
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,720
If you say this,

25
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,960
I'm ashamed to show my face.

26
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,520
I was just speaking in jest.

27
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,409
Sit down.

28
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,080
If you really want me to decide

29
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,200
and pick someone out to help your wife manage the house.

30
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,840
I have someone in mind.

31
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,160
Ru An,

32
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,960
bring the album here.

33
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,960
Minglan?

34
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,960
This can only be her writing.

35
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,760
Mother, are you joking?

36
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,800
Minglan is only barely reaching the marriage age,

37
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,880
and she's an unmarried maiden.

38
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,800
She, how can

39
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,240
she manage this grand house

40
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,160
Look at that carefully.

41
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,080
These are Minglan's

42
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,640
daily records

43
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,680
of each house and

44
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,680
their expenditures and ledgers.

45
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,752
I asked her why she's recording this.

46
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,800
She said one reason was for practicing writing,

47
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,846
and the other is learn to manage

48
00:03:15,846 --> 00:03:17,280
the finances of the family,

49
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,800
since that's also a duty

50
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,040
for a woman of the inner court.

51
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,800
Rulan is with Big Madam.

52
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,640
Molan is with Mistress Lin.

53
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,520
They can both be blind and deaf.

54
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,320
But she has to rely on careful observations

55
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,960
every day to learn.

56
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,440
Even if she can't pick up everything,

57
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,520
she can pick up a point or two.

58
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,160
She's a good child

59
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,000
and is more mature than her two older sisters.

60
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,160
Look at how she has

61
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,760
recorded everything clearly.

62
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,440
Some accounts are not very clear.

63
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,360
She could even find out where the deficit is.

64
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,360
She has the talent.

65
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,760
She is surely a good pair of hands to manage the house.

66
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,480
Another point.

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,600
Minglan's few words were remembered by you,

68
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,381
and helped you get out of your bind

69
00:04:01,381 --> 00:04:02,320
in the royal palace.

70
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,240
With this kind of sensibility,

71
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,720
she can be unbiased.

72
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,720
Let Minglan manage the house then.

73
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,440
The manager of the house

74
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,400
has to have the look of a manager.

75
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,080
Minglan should be self-reliant too.

76
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,320
Tell the staff to tidy up the courtyard

77
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,320
next to Shou An Hall,

78
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,880
and let her live there alone.

79
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,880
As a steward,

80
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,880
she should have the air of one too.

81
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,400
Why aren't you saying anything?

82
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,120
You don't

83
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,040
want to be a steward?

84
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,790
It's not that, Grandmother.

85
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,600
I prefer to

86
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,520
stay with you.

87
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,320
You are already an adult.

88
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,400
You should leave your parents.

89
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,840
When you marry,

90
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,560
you will leave your family.

91
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,200
If it's hard or sweet now, be done with it.

92
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,680
You will bear them alone.

93
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,360
If I just dote on you.

94
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,240
Well, I'd love to just dote on you forever.

95
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,200
But I have to be tough.

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
How could I not understand

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,480
what you said.

98
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,800
Since Father

99
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,560
and you have faith in me,

100
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,200
I will be brave and give it a try.

101
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,920
Be brave and give it a try?

102
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,560
You delivered words to

103
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,601
Weirui Balcony for me yesterday.

104
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,800
You had a method and you had authority.

105
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,160
I can see

106
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,000
that you are capable.

107
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,400
Stop pretending to be stupid in front of me.

108
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,160
I am always a child

109
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,320
in front of you.

110
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,722
I will never grow up.

111
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,320
Don't worry. If you run into any troubles

112
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,720
I will help you.

113
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,280
Tomorrow,

114
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,840
I will send over my capable maid

115
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,480
to be at your disposal.

116
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,720
If you are unhappy about anything,

117
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,920
tell me as soon as possible.

118
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,240
Grandmother,

119
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,800
I don't need the maid.

120
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,920
Since I'm going to manage the house and finance,

121
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,600
I can't make you

122
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,960
worry about anything.

123
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,960
If I can't handle it,

124
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,880
then I'll come beg help from you.

125
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,186
Mistress Lin's man came to my home

126
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,640
secretly to inquire,

127
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,600
and he's shown his face in Dong Alley.

128
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,440
According to Xiaodie's memory,

129
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,600
there used to be a physician

130
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,720
by the name of Zhang

131
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,400
who's treated your family.

132
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,840
I thought that must be where the clue is.

133
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,720
We rushed there,

134
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,840
and the neighbors said he did live there before.

135
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,680
But his whereabouts are unknown now.

136
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,176
Your uncle-in-law has already gone

137
00:06:59,176 --> 00:06:59,800
to search out information,

138
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,400
but he's not sent news yet.

139
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,920
We are doing our best May you not fret.

140
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,840
Miss, Second Brother give

141
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,120
a Guanyao flower vase as congratulatory gift.

142
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,800
Where should I place this?

143
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,200
Miss? How about placing here?

144
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,200
What did Linqi Pavilion send?

145
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,320
It seems like

146
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,680
Miss Molan sent a painting.

147
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,840
I'm going to get it for you.

148
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,120
Miss, look.

149
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,391
Fourth Sister actually sent me a painting

150
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,831
of a cow licking her calf?

151
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,063
Isn't that something!

152
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,400
Let's put this great intention of Fourth Sister's

153
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,240
next to my mother's one, Lady Li guarding Niangziguan.

154
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:51,880
Alright.

155
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,560
Yes, hang them together.

156
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,520
Let me see them every day

157
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,000
and not forget.

158
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,240
Miss, what are you burning?

159
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,960
I did a bad job of writing this.

160
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,720
These days,

161
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,400
don't always worry about writing.

162
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,480
We've just moved here,

163
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,920
and you have to watch carefully

164
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,960
so that the servants don't make a mess.

165
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,160
But I've got you watching over them.

166
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,480
It's not appropriate for me to watch over them.

167
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,000
Old Madam wanted to choose

168
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
some capable servants to come here.

169
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,240
Why did you refuse?

170
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,560
This is a new courtyard.

171
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,080
Including Xiaotao and I,

172
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,320
there are only a few of us.

173
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,840
If anything goes awry

174
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,080
and we can't handle it,

175
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,320
what are we to do?

176
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,040
Don't be anxious.

177
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,600
Someone will send over people.

178
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,640
Who will do that?

179
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,040
It will be within the next couple of days.

180
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,960
Look at those airs Old Madam puts on.

181
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,792
I had that courtyard

182
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,792
cleaned up a couple of times already,

183
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,000
and she keeps saying it's not good enough.

184
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,240
She insists on having the Minister

185
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,040
hire cobblers and carpenters.

186
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,520
I don't know

187
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,014
if she actually thinks that

188
00:09:19,014 --> 00:09:22,480
Sixth Daughter will manage forever?

189
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,480
Don't get upset over a girl.

190
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,640
Old Madam doesn't want to manage the house.

191
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,160
She threw the Sixth Miss out there

192
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,960
and that's for your sake too,

193
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,720
so that the management rights

194
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,440
don't fall into Lin's hands.

195
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,240
That slut, Lin Qinshuang,

196
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,360
such a great chance

197
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,200
and we couldn't get her killed.

198
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,908
She caused me to lose the rights

199
00:09:50,908 --> 00:09:51,789
to manage the house.

200
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,000
What blue smoke is

201
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,920
her ancestor spewing out?

202
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,360
The matter you told me about yesterday,

203
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,240
I've thought it through.

204
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,200
Let's just have Jiu'er and Yinxing

205
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,760
go work in Sixth Miss' room.

206
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,000
Jiu'er is your biological child.

207
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,040
Can you bear to let her go?

208
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,200
It's because she's my biological child,

209
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,240
that we don't

210
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,320
have to worry

211
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,320
she'll be mistreated by Sixth Miss.

212
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,440
When Jiu 'er is of marriageable age,

213
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,480
I will give

214
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,880
her a good dowry.

215
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,160
Thank you, Madam.

216
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,800
Greetings, Sisters.

217
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,640
I'm late.

218
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,400
Sixth Sister, you've set up your own courtyard.

219
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,535
It's your first time

220
00:10:44,535 --> 00:10:45,920
going back to Shouan Hall to visit.

221
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,720
Grandmother naturally

222
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,720
can't bear to let her leave.

223
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,880
Unlike like us,

224
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,320
we only said a few words

225
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,640
and we were dismissed.

226
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,400
What's wrong? I didn't say the right thing?

227
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,840
Grandmother likes Sixth Sister,

228
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,080
she doesn't like you!

229
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,920
You can't even begin to be jealous.

230
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,520
That's so true.

231
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,960
Now that Sixth Sister is flesh

232
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,600
on Grandmother's heart,

233
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,360
she is also a steward.

234
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,880
Even if she greets Big Madam late,

235
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,800
it's no big deal.

236
00:11:18,446 --> 00:11:21,206
Will she still punish you?

237
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,520
Fourth Sister, your words are strange.

238
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,880
If Big Madam punishes me,

239
00:11:27,245 --> 00:11:28,440
she's blaming Grandmother.

240
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,560
If Big Madam doesn't punish me,

241
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,960
it seems like she's afraid of Grandmother.

242
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,920
Your word hits

243
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,600
not only me

244
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,160
but also Grandmother,

245
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,040
and also is unforgiving toward Big Madam.

246
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,360
Killing three birds with one stone?

247
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,560
What's the reason?

248
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:42,840
You're

249
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,920
alive today?

250
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,688
You are slandering me!

251
00:11:45,688 --> 00:11:46,579
You are blaming other people's

252
00:11:46,579 --> 00:11:47,240
thoughts and intentions!

253
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,960
You said that I slandered you.

254
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,600
Sister,

255
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,720
this is not what you mean then?

256
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,920
Thus, Big Madam

257
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,160
doesn't need to punish me then.

258
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,320
You!

259
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,014
Do you still think that

260
00:11:59,014 --> 00:12:00,080
as the steward of the Sheng family,

261
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,480
you can make the decisions?

262
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,160
Big Madam is already sitting down.

263
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,800
Please go and greet her.

264
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,800
Be careful of the steps, Fourth Sister.

265
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,800
Be seated.

266
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm late.

267
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,360
I caused you to wait.

268
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,280
Hurry and

269
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,320
bring a bowl of ginseng soup

270
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,240
for our Minglan to try.

271
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,040
Thank you, Big Madam.

272
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,945
Sit.

273
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,240
Mother,

274
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,400
Sixth Sister is living on her own now.

275
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,600
You must dote on her more

276
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,520
or someone will bully her.

277
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,280
Minglan was always weak-bodied.

278
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,960
When she traveled by boat from Yangzhou,

279
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,600
she was sick on the boat.

280
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,080
Fortunately, Old Madam took care of her

281
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,720
and nursed her back to health.

282
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,400
You are now living alone

283
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,600
in your own courtyard.

284
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,440
I feel consoled.

285
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,640
It's just that

286
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,840
the staff with you are young and old.

287
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,840
They can't serve you.

288
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,960
Mother Liu.

289
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,840
Yes.

290
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,880
Sixth Miss,

291
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,840
these two maids

292
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,280
are Big Madam's attendants.

293
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,920
They are apt hands

294
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,360
and most attentive.

295
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,080
Today, Big Madam is

296
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,480
letting you have these maids

297
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,360
to prevent Sixth Miss

298
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,640
from being too tired,

299
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:21,924
and ruining your health

300
00:13:21,924 --> 00:13:22,840
from living alone and managing the house.

301
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,800
Yinxing, Jiu'er,

302
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
greet Sixth Miss.

303
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,040
Greetings to Sixth Miss.

304
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,256
May you prosper.

305
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,440
You are giving

306
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,200
your best hands to me?

307
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,040
There won't be anyone by your side then.

308
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,080
My rights to manage the house have gone to you.

309
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,840
I don't need them anymore.

310
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,480
Look at how you speak.

311
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,000
Just don't complain

312
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,440
that they are stupid and clumsy.

313
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,960
Yes. I have most high esteem

314
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,400
of your maids.

315
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,280
Try this.

316
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,360
Sixth Sister

317
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,760
is now the steward,

318
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,880
and now you speak with sharp, prickly words.

319
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,760
She's great.

320
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,949
Aren't you the one

321
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,109
who speaks with sharp prickly words?

322
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,400
What's wrong? Just because you are late,

323
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,040
I can't say anything?

324
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,280
A person needs a face and a tree needs bark.

325
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,400
If on my first day

326
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,200
I allow your mockery

327
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,400
to stir up a mess,

328
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,320
it's a small matter if I lose face

329
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,000
but if Grandmother loses face,

330
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,160
it's a major matter.

331
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,440
For Grandmother's sake,

332
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,600
even if I offended you,

333
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,960
I have no choice but to hold my position.

334
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,360
You were a messenger

335
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,240
of Grandmother at first,

336
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,360
and even a steward now.

337
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,970
Just a few days

338
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,155
and your mouth has become so clever.

339
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,240
Why do you bother fighting out of pride with me?

340
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,440
We three sisters,

341
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,360
by looks, by talent,

342
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,240
and by our place in Father's heart,

343
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,200
you are above us all.

344
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,640
You don't need to

345
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,520
flatter me to make me happy.

346
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,520
You have Mistress Lin above you

347
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,200
and Third Brother under you.

348
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,840
You're beautiful and talented.

349
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,280
So many main-line daughters out there

350
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,880
don't have your bearing.

351
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,880
I'm just an orphan

352
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,640
without my birth mother.

353
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,680
I don't have any brothers either.

354
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,560
And Grandmother is only just pitying me a bit

355
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,800
on the account

356
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,920
that my mother is deceased.

357
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,840
You want to knock me down in spirit

358
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,720
and force me to fight back.

359
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,960
What will you gain

360
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,680
in honor or benefit?

361
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,560
You're young and you're in charge of the house.

362
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,760
Who can be loftier than you?

363
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,960
You're so smart and

364
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,160
you can't tell?

365
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,760
This managing of the house,

366
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,600
it's only temporary.

367
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,600
Just to make do and gloss over.

368
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,840
Some day

369
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,440
Some day?

370
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,120
Grandmother is insipid

371
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,480
and detests conventional affairs.

372
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,640
I've been taught by her

373
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,480
and I live with my head lowered.

374
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,840
Will I really be the steward

375
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,960
of the Sheng family for life?

376
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,920
Once the crisis is over,

377
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,240
they will definitely find another steward.

378
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,760
Who?

379
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,440
Of course,

380
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,880
it's someone who will think for the Sheng family.

381
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,200
You and I both lack the luck

382
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,920
of being born to the main wife.

383
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,200
We are kindred souls.

384
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,000
There's a benefit

385
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
in talking with someone smart.

386
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,760
It's that once you've spoken,

387
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,400
all things are understood.

388
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,720
She really said that?

389
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Could it be false?

390
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,520
I heard this from Yunzai.

391
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,440
Who will think

392
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,040
For the Sheng family in this house?

393
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,160
Big Madam spread out

394
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,280
high-interest private loans

395
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,251
and she gave assets

396
00:17:03,251 --> 00:17:03,960
to her elder sister in Wang House.

397
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,160
You are the only one

398
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,480
who will think for the Sheng family.

399
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,920
I fear that

400
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,480
Old Madam is harsh toward me.

401
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,960
If she really wants me to manage the house,

402
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,200
she can just put in a few nice words for me.

403
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,000
Won't your father comply?

404
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,520
Why did she have to bring out the Sixth Miss

405
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,480
as a pretense?

406
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,960
Mother, you are too fretful.

407
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,514
Third Brother's matter

408
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,954
and the matter of you selling shops,

409
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,160
it's only a few days ago.

410
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,560
Even if Grandmother wants to give it to you,

411
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,000
it won't be that fast.

412
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,320
She has to bring out that Sixth Miss

413
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,560
Did Sixth Daughter mention

414
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,440
her biological mother with you recently?

415
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,760
Mother, what are you doing?

416
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,280
Be good.

417
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,400
Tell me if she mentioned this to you.

418
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,920
I recall that she didn't mention this to me.

419
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,720
It was a long time ago.

420
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,360
I fear she can't

421
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,640
remember her mother anymore.

422
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,280
I can't even remember anything

423
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,160
when I was eight years old.

424
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,880
Eight years old?

425
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,960
I fear eight years is too grown up already.

426
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,720
Mother.

427
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,200
I think we can't fully believe

428
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,360
what Sixth Sister said.

429
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,680
Didn't Big Madam

430
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,760
shove two maids into her room?

431
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,040
We should pick out a couple to shove them in too.

432
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,320
You can think like this

433
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,680
and it shows you're considerate.

434
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,680
Your brother.

435
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,680
He's been worn down

436
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,320
by the warblers and swallows in his room.

437
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,320
Pick out two of the most foxy ones

438
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,600
and send them over.

439
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,360
But

440
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,160
what if she doesn't want them?

441
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,640
We must send them there,

442
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,520
or else your brother won't pass the test.

443
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,880
Even more so when he has committed a big mistake,

444
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,960
he must show ardent prudence

445
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,920
before your father reconsiders him.

446
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,760
Mother, it's not only older brother,

447
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,360
it's your matter of selling shops.

448
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,320
Darling Hong, I think you must be angry still.

449
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,240
Shuang'er also doesn't dare to come here.

450
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,640
But I have a matter for my dear Hong to decide on,

451
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,800
so I brought my thick skin

452
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,280
to come and beg you.

453
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,827
You can make decisions

454
00:20:18,827 --> 00:20:20,277
without consulting others now.

455
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,920
What's there for me to decide?

456
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,160
I know that

457
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,440
you have never believed what Big Madam

458
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,760
said about me.

459
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,320
Those dirty things!

460
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,760
She just loathes me

461
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,320
that I went out to sell land and shop.

462
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,400
Are you not here

463
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,520
to brew tea today?

464
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,040
At that time, I was still young.

465
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,221
Just when I was supposed to

466
00:21:30,221 --> 00:21:31,080
have marriage prospects,

467
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,800
my family suddenly became ruined.

468
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,640
I brought my sick mother

469
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,520
and wandered everywhere with no one to lean on.

470
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,480
Begging in coldness.

471
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,040
Mother left that day too.

472
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,000
I could only

473
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,120
use a mat to bury her.

474
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,769
Sometimes I would wake up

475
00:21:55,769 --> 00:21:56,720
in the middle of the night

476
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,800
and I would see you, darling Hong.

477
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,720
I would then think that

478
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,200
I could be saved.

479
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,120
I don't need to

480
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,000
live this kind of life again.

481
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,880
Hong dear,

482
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,160
you are Shuang'er's parent now.

483
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,600
It's already in the past.

484
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,600
I'm someone who's traumatized from fright.

485
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,526
That day,

486
00:22:26,526 --> 00:22:27,360
when I heard you were late

487
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,832
in coming back,

488
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,320
I thought about the day

489
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,720
my family was raided.

490
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,480
I told Big Madam,

491
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,000
what if something happens,

492
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,240
it's still best to

493
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,080
have some cash in hand.

494
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,040
Big Madam said that

495
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,120
I spouted nonsense and unlucky words.

496
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,880
I was just afraid

497
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,560
if something goes awry at home,

498
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,280
and that's why I went out.

499
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,160
I'm someone

500
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,080
who hasn't seen much of the world.

501
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,280
I'm also someone who can't make decisions.

502
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,120
Not like Big Madam

503
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,520
from a house of officials

504
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,480
who are resolute.

505
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,280
I'm just afraid,

506
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,840
what if something happens to you,

507
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,000
and I had some unregistered money in hand,

508
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,920
I could go to bribe the connections,

509
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,080
but I didn't expect you

510
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,680
to be so capable

511
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,520
and came back

512
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,000
safe and sound.

513
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,880
Big Madam knows

514
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,000
to gauge life.

515
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,840
I am really lacking compared to her

516
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,920
and just a

517
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,160
laughing-stock.

518
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,440
What do you want to ask me?

519
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:51,840
It's about Feng'er,

520
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,000
that fool, of course.

521
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,160
Feng'er told me

522
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,840
that Sixth Miss is living on her own

523
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,960
and she doesn't have enough staff.

524
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,680
He wants to send her

525
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,920
two maids to serve her.

526
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,920
I just fear it's not in accordance with the rules

527
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,840
for a brother to send staff to a sister,

528
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,920
so he had me come

529
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,920
and get your approval.

530
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,360
May you give me your approval

531
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,840
so I can tell Feng'er.

532
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,800
That's a great show of sibling affection.

533
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,680
I guess giving him

534
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,040
a beating has benefited him.

535
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,760
If he studies well,

536
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,520
he will have his day.

537
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,994
Darling Hong,

538
00:24:42,164 --> 00:24:43,560
if you are done with work,

539
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,880
come and watch Feng'er study tonight.

540
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,600
Since he has been studying,

541
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,120
he hasn't been going out.

542
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,600
That's good.

543
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,760
I will go and check.

544
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,280
If he causes more troubles,

545
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,040
I will break his legs.

546
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,840
Before you come,

547
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,880
I will personally break his legs.

548
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,680
Third Master thought that he can't

549
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,720
have his Sixth Sister lacking help.

550
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,082
And it's not right only he

551
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:18,135
has so many helpers.

552
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,360
These two women,

553
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,560
one is Ke'er

554
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,744
and the other is Mei'er.

555
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,037
They are clumsy.

556
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,480
I hope you like them.

557
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,440
Please thank

558
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,094
Third Brother for me.

559
00:25:34,482 --> 00:25:36,080
Look at what you said, Miss.

560
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,320
If they can be of use,

561
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,880
that's their luck.

562
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,720
You've worked hard.

563
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,120
Xiaotao.

564
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,760
Escort Miss Zhou out.

565
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,240
No need to be so formal.

566
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,680
I, W, Will I still

567
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,960
be able to see Third Master?

568
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,400
If she can't bear to leave her old master,

569
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,400
it's best that she goes back to him.

570
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,240
Sixth Miss, she doesn't know anything.

571
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,000
Please show her more guidance in the future.

572
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,560
They are all from Mistress Lin

573
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,760
and Third Brother's prestige.

574
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,480
Naturally, I will hold them in high esteem.

575
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,920
Miss Zhou, please don't worry.

576
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,160
Nanny Zhou, you are here.

577
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,880
You even sent two maids here.

578
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,960
What a coincidence.

579
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,960
Old Madam is also

580
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,080
sending a clever one to Sixth Miss.

581
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,520
Cuiwei,

582
00:26:34,609 --> 00:26:36,000
greet Nanny Zhou.

583
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,680
Greetings, Nanny Zhou.

584
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,600
Greetings, Sixth Miss.

585
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,960
I, Cuiwei,

586
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,760
used to be Old Madam's

587
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,800
first ranking maidservant.

588
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,280
I will serve you in the future.

589
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,360
Shouan Hall to Sixth Daughter

590
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,760
is only a couple steps away.

591
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,000
You make a shout in the front

592
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,880
and Old Madam can come.

593
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,590
So it's understandable

594
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,310
that you ran into Nanny Fang.

595
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,560
That Old Madam has intentions.

596
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,760
How calculating

597
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,400
that Sixth Daughter

598
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,360
deliberately didn't take any staff

599
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,240
from Shou An Hall.

600
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,600
The position was empty.

601
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,440
Empty?

602
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,720
She deliberately left it empty?

603
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,480
That's right.

604
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,440
We can't have the Old Madam send one,

605
00:28:02,607 --> 00:28:03,920
then Big Madam send one over too.

606
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,040
And it becomes a show

607
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,600
of force between mother and daughter-in-law.

608
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,760
So, she deliberately left it empty.

609
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,640
After we all install ours,

610
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,440
Old Madam can

611
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,880
send a higher-ranked maid there.

612
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,720
So, Old Madam

613
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,480
sent her maid over

614
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,120
just to

615
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,280
keep our people down?

616
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Isn't that so?

617
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,600
That Cuiwei goes there

618
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,440
and she fills

619
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,000
the supervising position.

620
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,400
Our Mucang Pagoda is a new courtyard.

621
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,880
Since you serve a new master now,

622
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,560
you need to follow the new master's rules.

623
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,160
Each and every move

624
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,240
needs to be chartered.

625
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,000
Yes.

626
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,520
First, do not forget who you work for.

627
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,840
Second, you have to keep faith to your duty

628
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,040
and do not leave without permission.

629
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,440
Third, you are not to fight and cause issues.

630
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,160
Fourth, do not enter the main suite unauthorized.

631
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,440
Fifth, you cannot push off your own duty onto another.

632
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,600
I don't understand.

633
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,880
If someone gives me trouble,

634
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,200
can I tell?

635
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,400
Why exactly is it not allowed

636
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,440
to fight and cause issues?

637
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,720
Miss Jiu'er,

638
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,206
what you're doing is fighting

639
00:29:08,206 --> 00:29:08,960
and causing an issue now.

640
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,240
Sister Cuiwei has such a grand position.

641
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,120
Sister Cuiwei, don't scare us.

642
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,680
We are the most respectful.

643
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,680
That's right.

644
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,120
If Miss Jiu'er talks again,

645
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,640
I fear

646
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,440
I will have to quarrel with you.

647
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,360
But if we really quarrel,

648
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,440
we will be breaking the third clause.

649
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,280
Jiu'er and I are to receive five strokes each.

650
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,200
Danju, you carry out the punishment.

651
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,360
Miss,

652
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,600
if they don't obey Sister Cuiwei,

653
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,360
what should we do?

654
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,920
There's benefit to listening,

655
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,920
and there's benefit to not listening.

656
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,120
That's a Buddhist verse you're reciting.

657
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,440
Cover.

658
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,760
Miss Ju'er,

659
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,160
what else do you want to say?

660
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,913
Everyone, let's do our best

661
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,160
and take good care of Sixth Miss.

662
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,360
This is a fate that binds us.

663
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,520
I'm older than you

664
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,920
and senior to you.

665
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,680
And thanks to Old Madam,

666
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,120
my scope is wider too.

667
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,400
But may you sisters

668
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,480
not dislike me.

669
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,480
Just give me a bottle of Cuoren Water .

670
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,920
Having cold wine again?

671
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,240
Drinking cold wine on a cold day

672
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,560
is quite a unique experience.

673
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,960
You're so full of tricks.

674
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,360
Is Sixth Miss

675
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,440
really that smart?

676
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,440
How can you be so stupid?

677
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,480
This kind of chain maneuver.

678
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,760
How can she think of it

679
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,200
as her young age?

680
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,120
It must be Old Madam

681
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,560
plotting it all out.

682
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,200
It's a warning to us

683
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,240
that no one can mess with

684
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,960
her precious Sixth Granddaughter.

685
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,280
Before,

686
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,790
Old Madam was so serene,

687
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,360
that the room was like a temple.

688
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,440
Since she raised this Sixth Daughter,

689
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,542
she's forsaken vegetarianism

690
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,000
and her complexion is better.

691
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,960
She's garnered stamina to climb Mount Ziyun too.

692
00:31:21,801 --> 00:31:23,000
Looking at her,

693
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,800
she seems to want to live forever.

694
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,920
Marry that girl off and

695
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,840
lay a path for her to reach high.

696
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,200
She's got her legs half buried in the ground

697
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,360
and still thinks so much.

698
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,600
Mistress, just bear it for the time being.

699
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,800
Don't clash with Old Madam.

700
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,800
The house management

701
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,840
will need Old Madam's approval no matter what.

702
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,840
One day when I've made it

703
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,120
What's wrong with Grandmother?

704
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,160
Old Madam is waiting for you.

705
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,720
How come she got ill so suddenly?

706
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
What does the physician say?

707
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,400
Watch the courtyard closely.

708
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,680
Yes.

709
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,540
My eldest granddaughter is most filial.

710
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,760
When she heard that I'm sick,

711
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,880
she rushed here so quickly, Old Madam He.

712
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,280
You're so chatty.

713
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,623
Quick, have your filial granddaughter

714
00:33:05,623 --> 00:33:06,480
look at the fabric I brought.

715
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,320
Pick one you like

716
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,400
and use it

717
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,710
to make some robes.

718
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,400
Grandmother,

719
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,440
didn't you say you were sick?

720
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,840
I was afraid you couldn't leave

721
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,533
with so many chores

722
00:33:19,533 --> 00:33:20,760
from your mother-in-law so I fibbed.

723
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,680
Come.

724
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,240
This is whom I often talked about,

725
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,520
the Grandmother of He House.

726
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,680
Now she's moved to the capital to stay,

727
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,760
I invited her here

728
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,399
for a gathering.

729
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,000
This is the grandson of Grandmother He.

730
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,080
His name is He Hongwen.

731
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,760
Greetings, Grandmother.

732
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,760
Greetings Brother He.

733
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,040
Greetings, Miss Sheng.

734
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,760
You came from afar.

735
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,400
Why don't you stay for a few days longer?

736
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,640
It would be just nice

737
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,880
to have fun with Grandmother.

738
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,680
This child is really smart.

739
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,451
Grandmother just told you

740
00:33:58,451 --> 00:34:00,120
she brought fabric as gifts.

741
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,040
Go take a look now.

742
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,280
Mother.

743
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,160
It's alright.

744
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,000
Big Madam is a straight-talker

745
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,360
and I don't want to put on airs.

746
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,760
The items are in the room.

747
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,640
Go and take a look now.

748
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,120
Let's go.

749
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,680
Sixth Sister, come with me.

750
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:16,640
She has already chosen. Go now.

751
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:17,960
Let's go

752
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,040
and take a look.

753
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,720
Take a seat.

754
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,600
Come.

755
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,600
Take a seat too.

756
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,360
Please sit.

757
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,720
Xiaotao,

758
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,040
serve tea to our guest immediately.

759
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,840
Yes.

760
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,240
Why haven't they finished viewing the materials?

761
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,834
Maybe there are too many.

762
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,320
No matter how many there are,

763
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,360
they should have completed viewing them.

764
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,880
Perhaps the materials are really great.

765
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,880
It's really quite hard to be a physician.

766
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,600
I came to do a treatment

767
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,680
and I have to bring fabric as a big pretense.

768
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,440
It's not easy being a woman either.

769
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,160
In order to receive a treatment,

770
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:10,522
she needs to say

771
00:36:10,522 --> 00:36:11,320
her maiden grandmother is ill in bed.

772
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,640
That's right.

773
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,177
There's always been a tradition

774
00:36:15,177 --> 00:36:16,120
of hiding one's sickness to avoid criticism.

775
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,280
And that's hardest on women of inner quarters.

776
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,680
An ailment is a double-edged sword for them.

777
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,600
Your sister is in a difficult position.

778
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,920
Do you really regard it that way?

779
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,762
It's always been hard

780
00:36:27,762 --> 00:36:28,982
to be a woman since ancient times.

781
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,880
There are not many paths for them

782
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,120
and each is narrow and steep.

783
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,000
At my grandmother's talent,

784
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,160
if she were a man,

785
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,120
she would be a renowned physician of our time,

786
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,480
and her name would be glorified.

787
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,600
With your thinking,

788
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,600
your grandmother must find such solace.

789
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,588
I sigh that my grandmother

790
00:36:49,588 --> 00:36:50,840
is full of all kinds of talents.

791
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,440
But she can only stay in the inner courtyard,

792
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,640
managing the house.

793
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,560
At best, she could only teach this

794
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,920
unworthy grandson of hers.

795
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,200
How can you not be good?

796
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,080
I heard from Grandmother

797
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,720
that you've already established your own clinic.

798
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,760
Since it's a medical center,

799
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,760
then I won't wish you to have

800
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,840
a flourishing business.

801
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,920
You ought not.

802
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,440
Since you've praised me,

803
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,640
I will tell you something else.

804
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,400
Don't take any cold wine,

805
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,160
especially before sleeping.

806
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,440
I didn't.

807
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,440
I, I haven't...

808
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,920
Are you a physician

809
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,420
or a kitchen god?

810
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:37,860
How did you know?

811
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,148
Who said that I was good?

812
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,560
With He House's lustrous words,

813
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,520
vouching that you can have another child soon,

814
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,960
I'm put to much more ease.

815
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,280
You must listen to her

816
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,360
and manage your health well.

817
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,360
As for managing the house,

818
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,160
don't toil over it.

819
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,760
You can cry or beg too.

820
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,760
Pretend to be sick or act like you're incapable.

821
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,120
Find some pretext to throw it out.

822
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,720
All these years,

823
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,720
Hua'er has worked very hard

824
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:18,880
and she finally got herself

825
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,000
the reputation of being a good steward.

826
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,240
How can she just let that go?

827
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,440
You're confused.

828
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,160
Count of Zhongqin Manor.

829
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,080
It will all be inherited by the eldest son,

830
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,520
Yuan Wenchun.

831
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,280
Hua'er's husband won't have the day.

832
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,720
It's just that the mother-in-law

833
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,200
is so biased towards the eldest

834
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,120
that she's tormenting Hua'er on purpose.

835
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:40,847
The saying says,

836
00:38:40,847 --> 00:38:42,440
"once you manage the house for three years,

837
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,600
even the dog and cat hate you".

838
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,320
Hua'er is a daughter.

839
00:38:45,704 --> 00:38:47,120
No matter how hard she works,

840
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,520
she's just adding to another's asset.

841
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,440
You are right, Grandmother.

842
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,800
Count of Zhongqin's house expenditures are careless.

843
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,360
I have added my own dowry money

844
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,480
into it to balance it.

845
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,320
What is all the trouble for?

846
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,840
That Yuan House,

847
00:39:02,878 --> 00:39:04,811
they are a respectable count's manor.

848
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,017
They are so shameless that

849
00:39:06,017 --> 00:39:07,306
they use the daughter-in-law's dowry?

850
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,426
Attendants! Attendants!

851
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,348
Get my carriage,

852
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:13,880
I need to argue

853
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,040
this out with Yuan House!

854
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:15,800
Mother.

855
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,800
Come back. Come back.

856
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,920
Cool down.

857
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,200
Come back here.

858
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:23,581
If you can argue for a win

859
00:39:23,581 --> 00:39:24,860
for the matters of the world,

860
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,297
then all will be in harmony.

861
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,800
The Sixteen Prefectures of Yan and Yun

862
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,120
will all be reclaimed!

863
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,720
I have never seen this kind of noble house

864
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,760
with such shame as to

865
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,960
use the daughter-in-law's dowry?

866
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,898
Which house doesn't have a rotten account?

867
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,560
A minor issue that some minor money can fill

868
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,720
isn't worth mentioning.

869
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,720
Your daughter is weak-boned

870
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,680
and she can't toil.

871
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,560
Let her shove away the steward job

872
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,160
and recuperate.

873
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,360
Take the medicine prescribed by He House.

874
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,316
Bearing a child is the more urgent matter.

875
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,240
Don't be angry, Grandmother.

876
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,040
Mother and Ru'er have the same temperament.

877
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,160
You know about this too.

878
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,400
When I used to come and cry,

879
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,320
she would say she would go to Yuan House

880
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,680
and flip them upside down.

881
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,160
In the future,

882
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,200
if you are bullied or ill,

883
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,840
come and tell us.

884
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,840
Don't adhere to such old ideas.

885
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,720
You have to be happy yourself.

886
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,440
Grandmother,

887
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,960
I came back this time,

888
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,480
so allow me to dote on my siblings a bit.

889
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,443
I hear in a couple of days out

890
00:40:21,443 --> 00:40:22,040
by Xinzheng Gate by Jinming Pond,

891
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,680
there will be a polo match.

892
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,000
It's put together

893
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,120
by Countess of Yongchang

894
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,520
and she's using all sorts of precious accessories

895
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,240
as prizes.

896
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,120
All the noble ladies near Jinglong Gate

897
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,960
and Changhe Gate have gone there.

898
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,040
So let's have my siblings

899
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,619
go there and have fun too.

900
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,230
Madam Wu's polo match

901
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,350
is such a grand event.

902
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:55,920
So many official's wives

903
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,760
will be there.

904
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,520
They are all to watch

905
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,080
the eligible men and women there.

906
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,400
Such a great event

907
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,360
and couldn't you

908
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,120
just tell me secretly?

909
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,160
You had to say it

910
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,440
in front of the Old Madam.

911
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,360
Now it's great.

912
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,360
The three Lan girls will be there too.

913
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,240
Forget it if they take Minglan as well.

914
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,880
Why must they insist on

915
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,080
taking with that slut's daughter too?

916
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,280
If she tries to reach high,

917
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:21,880
I will be

918
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,240
coughing up blood.

919
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,640
Mother, just treat it

920
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,680
as planning

921
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,480
the future of Young Sixth Miss

922
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,440
Grandmother had Sixth Miss

923
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,880
look at his son.

924
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,680
If Sixth Sister

925
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,600
can find a good husband,

926
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,240
Grandmother will be very happy too.

927
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,600
Since I've had my daughter,

928
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,720
I have not been pregnant for years.

929
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,320
Grandmother put aside her pride

930
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,000
and found Old Madam He,

931
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,320
and plotted for us

932
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,560
to have Sixth Miss

933
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,600
come out and manage house.

934
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,080
So the house key

935
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:49,760
was spared

936
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,800
from falling into that Mistress Lin's hands.

937
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:52,837
This is all due to

938
00:41:52,837 --> 00:41:53,720
Grandmother treating us well.

939
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,840
So if we plan for Young Sixth Miss more,

940
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,040
It's also considered as repaying Grandmother.

941
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:58,920
All right！

942
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,720
You are always sensible.

943
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,320
Get ready to go then.
