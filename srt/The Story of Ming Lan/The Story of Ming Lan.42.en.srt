The Story of Ming Lan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,580
Episode 42

3
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,360
Mother-in-law.

4
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,400
Fourth Son-in-law,

5
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,120
my Molan

6
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,720
didn't cause you trouble, right?

7
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,240
She didn't.

8
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,520
That's good then.

9
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,440
Minglan, General.

10
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,040
Greetings, Big Madam.

11
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,720
General, my Minglan

12
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,840
didn't give you trouble, right?

13
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,080
Minglan is

14
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,240
very cultured and sensible.

15
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,080
Everyone in my family loves her.

16
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,440
That's good then.

17
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,560
Seeing you all

18
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,280
are now married,

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
as a mother,

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,120
I feel relieved.

21
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,150
You all haven't met

22
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,790
my elder sister, right?

23
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,800
You should call her "Auntie Kang".

24
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,120
This is the Auntie Kang

25
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,240
that I mentioned before.

26
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,080
Auntie, greetings.

27
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,360
I heard that

28
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,400
Fourth Son-in-law has a new-born daughter.

29
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,880
Congratulations!

30
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,600
Before you go back later,

31
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,520
take a red envelope

32
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,120
for my new granddaughter.

33
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,000
Thank you, Mother-in-law.

34
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,000
Okay. You can go out

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,560
to have some tea and fruits

36
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,800
while waiting for the meal.

37
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,360
Okay.

38
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,440
Let's go. Let's go.

39
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,280
Molan.

40
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,200
Sit.

41
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,880
Please.

42
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,360
Come on.

43
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,240
Don't be mad.

44
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,920
Didn't Fourth Sister have a miscarriage?

45
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,120
How comes...

46
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,120
Of course it's not hers!

47
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,680
It's a bastard born by a

48
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,560
paramour of Fourth Brother-in-law

49
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,880
before he got married.

50
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,400
I heard that it was a difficult delivery.

51
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,520
The son was too big

52
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,920
that she almost didn't deliver.

53
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,640
What?

54
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,560
Sixth Little Sister,

55
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,040
is it because you're having a good life now

56
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,360
that your ears aren't working well anymore?

57
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:08,880
I,

58
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,040
I just found this matter too strange.

59
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,240
I thought I heard it wrong.

60
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,000
You didn't hear wrong.

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,960
That was really what happened.

62
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,800
Fifth Sister, when will you

63
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,160
have a baby?

64
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,120
Look at that Sixth Miss of yours.

65
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,080
After marrying into a marquis family,

66
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,400
she's already on her high horse

67
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,720
when she back home.

68
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,960
She didn't.

69
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,000
Aren't both very respectful?

70
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,720
Look at how they

71
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,080
were mumbling earlier.

72
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,825
They were totally

73
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,905
not giving you any importance.

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,800
After all she is a wife

75
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,240
in the marquis manor now.

76
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,100
That Sixth Son-in-law

77
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,400
is currently a highly-favored person

78
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,280
in the Imperial court.

79
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,550
His hands and eyes can encompass the whole sky,

80
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,280
and his power is at the peak.

81
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,240
We mustn't offend him.

82
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,840
So you're just let her be like this?

83
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,400
No matter how high the status

84
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,040
that she married into,

85
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,920
isn't she still a lady

86
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,240
that grew up under you?

87
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,960
You should at least

88
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,360
show her some fierceness.

89
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,360
Forget it.

90
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,400
The future

91
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,920
of Rulan's husband

92
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,720
might even need the help of Sixth Son-in-law.

93
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,760
If you're afraid of her, I'm not.

94
00:04:20,402 --> 00:04:22,160
I surely will teach her a lesson.

95
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,920
Informing Big Madam,

96
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,160
the food has been served in the adjacent hall.

97
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,760
The men have their table outside,

98
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,000
while the women have theirs inside.

99
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,840
Elder Sister, let's eat.

100
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,800
Come, everyone, let's eat!

101
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,120
Molan.

102
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,440
Wait a minute!

103
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,720
Mother hasn't come out yet.

104
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,375
Didn't you say that

105
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,200
after socializing with them for a little bit,

106
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,400
we'll return to Shouan Hall?

107
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,040
Your grandmother is still waiting for you

108
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,960
to chat and dine with her.

109
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,600
If today were a normal day, that would be fine..

110
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,280
But today,

111
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,440
my Big Madam's elder sister

112
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,760
is here.

113
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,440
This person isn't easy to deal with.

114
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,320
She might

115
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,600
incite some trouble.

116
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,120
I'm fine.

117
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,360
When Grandmother finds that I didn't return,

118
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,000
she surely will send people to rescure me.

119
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,240
This is a habitual trick

120
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,320
that the two of us played.

121
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,240
For the first drink,

122
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,240
I'll give a toast to Big Madam.

123
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,440
When I was little, I was a sickly girl.

124
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,050
If it were not because of

125
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,160
the meticulous care of Big Madam,

126
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,720
I fear that I won't be able to be standing here.

127
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,360
I want to thank you,

128
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,480
Big Madam.

129
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,200
Oh my god! Look at you.

130
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,275
No need to say thanks

131
00:06:00,275 --> 00:06:01,040
to family members.

132
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,600
Just sit down.

133
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,425
Since you were little,

134
00:06:04,425 --> 00:06:05,840
you've been obedient and sensible.

135
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,200
You've given me less trouble

136
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
than these elder ones.

137
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,120
How could I not dote on you?

138
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,000
Little Sister,

139
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,440
among these daughters of yours,

140
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,800
Miss Ming

141
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,360
is the most successful one.

142
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,280
Maybe you will be needed

143
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,080
by the family a lot from now on.

144
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,640
You must remember the good

145
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,840
that your mother showed you

146
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,080
and not forget your roots.

147
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,640
Auntie is right for reminding me of that.

148
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,760
I will remember.

149
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,480
Now,

150
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,680
you have the best in-law background

151
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,560
and your husband is the most capable one.

152
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,920
Don't forget to

153
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,880
help those

154
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,680
two brother-in-laws of yours more.

155
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,880
Auntie,

156
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,960
what are you saying?

157
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,000
The husband of my Fourth Sister

158
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,680
is a son of a count.

159
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,840
He has a promising future ahead.

160
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,175
Fifth Brother-in-law has recently passed

161
00:06:53,175 --> 00:06:53,960
the Imperial civil examination.

162
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,080
He's a pure and scholarly official.

163
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,520
Either one is much better than

164
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,120
that military husband of mine.

165
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,200
In the future,

166
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:00,800
he still has to rely on

167
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,720
my two brother-in-laws.

168
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,320
Sixth Little Sister, you're being too naive

169
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,520
you didn't get it.

170
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,640
What Auntie Kang is saying is

171
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,800
that you should promote her son-in-law

172
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,480
more in the future.

173
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,080
Shut up.

174
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,480
Don't incite trouble

175
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,640
in front of your elders.

176
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,360
Just eat.

177
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,400
Saying promote, that's too much.

178
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,760
I've been taught by my parents since I was little.

179
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,400
I know that the most important thing in life

180
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,040
is to know how to repay kindness.

181
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,040
Those who are good to me,

182
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,400
I surely will repay them.

183
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,560
Even if Auntie don't mention it,

184
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,920
I have a list

185
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,960
where I've recorded them all.

186
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,720
Sixth Miss,

187
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,080
Old Madam is asking

188
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,160
if you're done eating.

189
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,350
If you're done,

190
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,175
please go to Shouan Hall

191
00:07:59,175 --> 00:07:59,990
to listen to her teaching.

192
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,680
Go.

193
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,680
Grandmother!

194
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,680
You saved me at the right time!

195
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,000
Otherwise I wouldn't be able to

196
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,200
get out of the labyrinth set up

197
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,480
by Auntie Kang and Big Madam!

198
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,280
Come here,

199
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,080
I've been waiting for you for so long,

200
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,640
so I'm starving already.

201
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,960
Have a sit.

202
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,520
Sit down. Let's eat.

203
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,840
What do you want to eat?

204
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,600
Old Madam,

205
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,520
it's been so long since you're so happy.

206
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:41,880
That's right.

207
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,800
It has been just two days, yet

208
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,650
Not seeing you for a day

209
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,840
and it's like three autumns have passed.

210
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,320
How many autumns would that have been now?

211
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,475
You must be missing me so much

212
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,755
that you've developed lovesickness.

213
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,320
Can't do anything about it.

214
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,760
I should be so adorable.

215
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,960
My god, you!

216
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,360
Are you also be like this in the Gu Family?

217
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,440
If you're like this in front of your in-laws,

218
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,440
people will say that

219
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,840
our Sheng Family is lack of discipline.

220
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,160
Grandmother, don't worry.

221
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,275
Your grandson-in-law

222
00:09:11,275 --> 00:09:12,320
is taking good care of me.

223
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,560
Nobody in his family would dare to bully me.

224
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,600
He's defending you?

225
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,280
Let me ask then.

226
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,240
Who is the chief steward

227
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,800
in your manor right now?

228
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,360
I haven't asked yet.

229
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,440
Are the houses and gardens good in your manor?

230
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,080
I heard that place was once

231
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,700
the house of an important minister

232
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,520
of the previous Emperor.

233
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,560
It was abandoned for almost a decade.

234
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,720
Shouldn't it be renovated?

235
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,680
He only took me around his manor once.

236
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,360
Regarding the renovating things,

237
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,960
I really don't know.

238
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,640
How much is the fixed asset

239
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,800
of your manor right now then?

240
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,160
You also don't know?

241
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,880
Well. Look at you.

242
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,640
I've taught you

243
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,240
to be a daughter

244
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,280
with all kinds of skills.

245
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,200
After you married,

246
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,800
your man keeps you inside your room

247
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,560
and not allow you to manage anything.

248
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,680
Isn't that a shame?

249
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,680
You don't know,

250
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,880
how big that garden mansion is.

251
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,160
Just the servants,

252
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,040
there are at least fifty.

253
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,080
Every time I think

254
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,480
about handling these matters,

255
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,120
I feel sleepy.

256
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,160
Your husband

257
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,640
is an unbridled person.

258
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,000
He hates being controlled the most.

259
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,120
With a man like that,

260
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,880
you mustn't be forceful.

261
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,240
Even if you are,

262
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,880
you can't win either.

263
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,960
His personality isn't only strong,

264
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,120
he even dares to lecture his elders.

265
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,680
Although he's defending you,

266
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,320
you shouldn't rely on him too much.

267
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,040
Women like us

268
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,480
must still be able to prop ourselves up.

269
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,760
First,

270
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,040
you must have money.

271
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,760
Second,

272
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,240
you must have a reliable assistant.

273
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,080
Only then your days can be carefree.

274
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,120
From those things he has done,

275
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,400
he's a man

276
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,080
that won't allow any flaws.

277
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,080
Before you do anything,

278
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,720
you must always tell him.

279
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,560
Don't you try to hide them

280
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,000
and pretend to be virtuous.

281
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:49,840
In that way,

282
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,875
the two of you will develop a barrier

283
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:52,480
between each other.

284
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,120
Understood?

285
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,850
He now holds great power

286
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,040
and has such unstable moods.

287
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,160
When he's nice, he's too nice,

288
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,160
as if he's another person.

289
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,400
Once he gets mad,

290
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,440
he also is too fierce, so scary.

291
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,200
I also don't dare to say one more word.

292
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,600
What if I say something wrong

293
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,560
and offend him?

294
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,120
Wouldn't our days together

295
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,320
be a hard one from then on?

296
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,600
Miss, are we leaving so soon?

297
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,880
Let's stay here a bit longer.

298
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,680
Grandmother is taking her afternoon nap.

299
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,800
If we don't leave now,

300
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,160
even if Big Madam won't say anything,

301
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,520
that Auntie Kang

302
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,400
will be nitpicking again.

303
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,120
There are still a lot of chances to come back.

304
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,360
Father, you're home!

305
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,520
Greetings, Father.

306
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,920
Why are you always on your high house

307
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,320
when you come back home?

308
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,600
Stop here!

309
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,880
Halt!

310
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,320
Danju, Xiaotao, you two come down.

311
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,000
I have some words to tell my wife.

312
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,240
Aren't you riding your horse?

313
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:06,880
What happened?

314
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,680
You've been sad

315
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,880
since we left the Sheng Manor.

316
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,480
I noticed it.

317
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,520
Did anyone bully you?

318
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,240
No.

319
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,760
I'm just too full.

320
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,950
I'll just get off the carriage, walk with it,

321
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:19,480
and I'll be fine.

322
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,360
Why walk?

323
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,800
Did Father-in-law see you?

324
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,240
If you have any problem

325
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,480
and you hide it from me,

326
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,640
once I find it out,

327
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,080
I'll do your make-up everyday

328
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,280
before letting you out!

329
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,160
It's nothing.

330
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,040
Father lectured me today.

331
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,280
He said we made it too grand

332
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,680
when we came home today.

333
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,880
It's too showy.

334
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,070
And I didn't urge you,

335
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,230
I was even proud of it.

336
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,040
Is that a big deal?

337
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,360
How is this showy?

338
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,200
If anyone's showing off, it's me.

339
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,440
Is there anything to do with you?

340
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,120
I'm an illegitimate daughter.

341
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,960
Being able to marry you is already a bless.

342
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,280
It's not right to be such a show-off.

343
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,680
Don't I already have all the good things?

344
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,000
When there's inequality,

345
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,160
there will be grudges and dislike.

346
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,640
Dislike?

347
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,280
Who dares to dislike you?

348
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,200
Whoever dislikes you, I will dislike him.

349
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,440
Let's see who would still dare to bully you.

350
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,960
It is better to avoid unnecessary trouble.

351
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,775
As they say, to put out a harmonious light

352
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:42,600
that is similar with the secular world.

353
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,760
We are a family.

354
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,525
It's better if everyone can live

355
00:15:46,525 --> 00:15:47,280
more or less the same life.

356
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,280
I mustn't look too different.

357
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,640
This is one reason.

358
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,480
Second,

359
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,840
I am too dignified

360
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,000
when I'm with you.

361
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,480
If next time they all come to me

362
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,480
to beg you to help them,

363
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,240
like getting promoted,

364
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,880
examinations, exiles,

365
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,040
all those messy things.

366
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,960
Tell me, should I help them or not?

367
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,360
I think

368
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,240
you sound reasonable.

369
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,440
Then from now on,

370
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,040
I won't be defending you too much

371
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,880
when in front of your maiden family.

372
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,240
It's better if you act more ferocious.

373
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,840
Like that? You scared me!

374
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,760
If I'm ferocious,

375
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,840
what about your dignity?

376
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,080
I already know you love me,

377
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,440
who cares about dignity?

378
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,760
When people see

379
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,960
how hard it is for me

380
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,080
to live with you,

381
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,280
maybe, they will

382
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,160
they will treat me better.

383
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,680
Okay.

384
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,520
I'll then tear off

385
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,760
a white and soft lambskin

386
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,080
and put it over a little fox like you.

387
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,440
That will get things done, once for all.

388
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,920
I once helped you

389
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,880
when we were still in Yangzhou.

390
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,360
You gifted me a pair of knee pads.

391
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,960
Until now,

392
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,280
I've still kept them inside my chest.

393
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,560
I saw them at home.

394
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,160
I've always been

395
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,400
grateful to you.

396
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:27,960
Can you

397
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,920
do me a favor,

398
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,720
help me with one thing?

399
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,800
Answer a question

400
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,480
Okay.

401
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,760
It must be a truthful answer.

402
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,680
That day

403
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,760
when they were trying to give me a concubine,

404
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,480
are you truly don't mind,

405
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,480
or because you just married me,

406
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,040
you wanted to pretend to be very virtuous?

407
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,520
You'd rather ignore His Majesty's intention

408
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,320
of your family being united,

409
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,440
and move out to another manor.

410
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,960
You even sent Hongxiao away,

411
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,640
so I could be saved from too much awkwardness.

412
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,150
With you defending me like this

413
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,200
and treating me so well,

414
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,000
I understand it all.

415
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,840
All are just trifling matters.

416
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,840
They're not.

417
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,250
My grandmother once said

418
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,520
that Brother,He was a very good man.

419
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,040
But when the Cao family

420
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,280
was pressuring me,

421
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,800
he clearly knew that I didn't like it,

422
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,080
but he still allowed me

423
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,200
to face them by myself.

424
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,040
In front of Miss Cao,

425
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,640
no matter what I said, it would be wrong.

426
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,560
But you're different.

427
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,550
Even if there will be a mountain of blades

428
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,160
or a sea of fire in front,

429
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,280
as long as you're trapped,

430
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,120
I will always have fair treatment.

431
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,600
Actually,

432
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,360
I only wanted fair treatment.

433
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,360
Be careful.

434
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,600
Be gentle.

435
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,840
Right.

436
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,520
Second Son and his wife

437
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,520
are really not afraid of the gossip.

438
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,880
They are just moving away like that.

439
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,040
With such a capable wife,

440
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,720
moving out is nothing.

441
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,920
I really have looked down on

442
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,240
that illegitimate daughter.

443
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,120
She can really act.

444
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,000
She is literate and schemes well.

445
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,760
No wonder Old Second

446
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,560
was determined to marry her.

447
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,840
Miss, you must be careful.

448
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,640
Your mother-in-law

449
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,840
might be coming up

450
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,800
with bad ideas.

451
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,950
I chose this path myself.

452
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,960
I'll just block off whatever comes my way.

453
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,120
Big Madam, you were right.

454
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,760
We'll be your guards.

455
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,120
What about the people

456
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,080
I told you to find?

457
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,560
I'm just waiting for your orders, Big Madam.

458
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,280
All are

459
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,440
old servants of ours.

460
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,600
They are very loyal

461
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,880
to you.

462
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,800
I'm guessing

463
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,720
that Fourth and Fifth Houses will be making

464
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,360
some moves too in the next few days.

465
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,960
By then, with one wall between us,

466
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,800
let's just wait to watch a show.

467
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,120
Wife, you're exhausted?

468
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,600
Fighting wars isn't as tiring as this.

469
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:16,920
Nonsense!

470
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,080
Fighting wars is ten times more tiring than this.

471
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,200
Okay. Okay. Okay. This is tiring.

472
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,720
It's tiring.

473
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,840
Everyone is asking me

474
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,640
where to put this,

475
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,840
where to put that.

476
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,640
I told them

477
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,840
to ask Danju and Cuiwei.

478
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,000
However, those two instead came back

479
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
to ask me about it.

480
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,320
It's all my fault for

481
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,560
being too busy with military affairs.

482
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,600
I've caused you to suffer.

483
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,200
It's easy to just say it.

484
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,480
Wife, let me

485
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,920
give you a massage!

486
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,640
But,

487
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,800
Look on the bright side.

488
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,680
You won't need to greet that person

489
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,880
tomorrow morning anymore.

490
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,160
You can sleep as long as you want.

491
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,320
Sleep until it's noon time.

492
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,040
Rest more.

493
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,000
Wife.

494
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,160
I'm hungry.

495
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,640
I haven't eat yet.

496
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,840
How about we change to another place today?

497
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,400
Let's eat the all-fish banquet

498
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,240
of Qianchun Restaurant,

499
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,200
how about it?

500
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,840
I don't want to eat anymore.

501
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,800
I'm really too sleepy.

502
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,240
How can that be?

503
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,040
No! No! No!

504
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,920
You can't sleep!

505
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,480
I still have words to tell you.

506
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,840
Can you just say it tomorrow?

507
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,720
I'm really too sleepy

508
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,440
that I can't open my eyes anymore.

509
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:10,720
Okay. Okay.

510
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,640
Wife. Wife. I'll just say a few words.

511
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,680
I'll just say a few words.

512
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,120
Be good.

513
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,360
Wait a minute.

514
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,640
Come, look.

515
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,200
How come there's another accounting book to read?

516
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,480
I can't do it anymore. My head aches.

517
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,120
Okay. Okay.

518
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,360
You can read this accounting book tomorrow,

519
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,440
but I have to

520
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,400
tell this matter today.

521
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,480
I've always been out

522
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,880
and have just set up my own manor not long ago.

523
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,400
These people in this manor

524
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,120
are mostly

525
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,360
granted by His Majesty.

526
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,200
These people

527
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,720
are either

528
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,680
punished subjects

529
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,760
or those

530
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,160
that have signed slave contracts.

531
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,840
Most don't have much foundation.

532
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,480
Look at them, and just use those that can be used.

533
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,200
For those that can't, we'll sell them.

534
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,200
But.

535
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,360
The Main, Fourth, and Fifth Houses

536
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,560
have sent some people.

537
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,160
You must be careful.

538
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,280
Who?

539
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,400
When did they send them?

540
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,680
When I left the Marquis Manor,

541
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,160
no one informed me.

542
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,600
Inform you?

543
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,560
If they informed you,

544
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,200
wouldn't that be giving you

545
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,800
a reason to reject them?

546
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,480
At that point,

547
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,040
you'll be kneeling in the ancestral hall again.

548
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,760
How would that Big Madam deal with it then?

549
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,680
So I think they want to

550
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,650
act first,

551
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:41,720
and tell you when it cannot be changed.

552
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,440
The people are here now.

553
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,720
You have to take them in,

554
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,960
whether you like it or not.

555
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:48,960
I.

556
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,640
If I can't offend them,

557
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,800
I surely can just avoid them.

558
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,120
Wife.

559
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,280
These account books

560
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,120
are the bills and particulars

561
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,280
of this manor.

562
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,280
Look at them tomorrow.

563
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,840
If there's anything that you don't understand,

564
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,160
ask my private assistant.

565
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:13,600
More importantly,

566
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,320
immediately expel those people

567
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,080
sent by the three Houses.

568
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,600
Don't leave any future trouble.

569
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,640
It won't be that easy,

570
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,960
my General Gu.

571
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,240
Even the Emperor has to fear

572
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,000
the gossiping mouths of his citizens.

573
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,160
Expelling them is easy,

574
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,880
but it won't be good if this news gets out.

575
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,560
How about

576
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,720
just assigning them to do manual labor outside?

577
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,640
Don't let them enter the inner courtyard.

578
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,000
A few male servants

579
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,120
can stay outside.

580
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,960
But for maidservants,

581
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,275
you can't really prohibit them

582
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,155
to entering the inner courtyard.

583
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,840
Never-ending battles

584
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,160
Therefore, Wife,

585
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,680
we must go eat an all-fish banquet

586
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,240
and refill our energy,

587
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,560
so we can battle it out with them!

588
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,040
You, You go eating by yourself.

589
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,600
I, I'm not going. I must sleep.

590
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,240
Let me sleep.

591
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,920
Okay. Okay. Okay.

592
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,840
We're not eating dinner anymore.

593
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,440
Sleep.

594
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,200
The two of us

595
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,640
should sleep more.

596
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:30,840
I.

597
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:32,760
I am not sleeping anymore!

598
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,240
I'm going to eat fish.

599
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,760
Go. Go. Go. Let's go eating fish.

600
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,320
How come you all didn't

601
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,600
wake me up again?

602
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,240
I got scolded by Nanny Cui again.

603
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,025
It was your husband

604
00:27:03,025 --> 00:27:04,000
who told us not to wake you up.

605
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,880
He even told us

606
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,200
to inform Nanny Cui

607
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,040
that from now on,

608
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,760
Miss doesn't need to get up so early.

609
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,440
You must call me as Big Madam.

610
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,640
We're not in the Sheng Manor.

611
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,600
I remember.

612
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,475
Calling you Big Madam

613
00:27:17,475 --> 00:27:18,520
gives you a more imposing manner.

614
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,000
It's not that I want to be imposing.

615
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,300
But if I don't get addressed

616
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,240
in a more imposing manner,

617
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,960
how can I deter those other servants?

618
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,120
My dear wife,

619
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,440
you're still not done with your make-up?

620
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,160
The Big Madam of the Fifth House is here.

621
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,520
She said that when you moved out a few days ago,

622
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,920
each house sent some servants to us.

623
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:40,550
She was afraid that

624
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,240
we're not familiar with who they are,

625
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,960
so she especially came to let you meet them.

626
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,080
Nanny, don't call her "Miss".

627
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,040
Call her "Big Madam".

628
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,680
Stop being particular about that.

629
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,560
That Fifth Big Madam doesn't seem

630
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,480
to have any good intentions.

631
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,480
Her daughter-in-law also came with her.

632
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,400
They had those servants

633
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,800
sent by the Marquis Manor

634
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,080
stand in formation,

635
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,080
each one holding their head high,

636
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,240
as if preparing for a cock-fight.

637
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,440
They don't seem to be here to visit you,

638
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,240
but to denounce you for some crime!

639
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,720
Miss.

640
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,680
Big Madam,

641
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,720
you must be careful against them.

642
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,320
That day in the Marquis Manor,

643
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,520
this Fifth Big Madam

644
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,760
was so calm and collected.

645
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,440
I think she isn't some nice person.

646
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,850
We must carefully weigh the pros and cons first

647
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:23,400
before taking any step.

648
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,320
Never thought

649
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,280
that she'd be here this fast.

650
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,880
Okay. I'll go meet them then.

651
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,880
Nanny Cui, go back and inform them.

652
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:34,960
May she go to Zhaohui Hall,

653
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,640
the main receiving hall, to sit for a while.

654
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,600
I'll be there in a minute.

655
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,680
Yes.

656
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,080
I'm so anxious.

657
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,720
Fifth Auntie, greetings.

658
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,520
Let me make the introductions.

659
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,280
Nanny Diao and Nanny Lai

660
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,040
are from your mother-in-law.

661
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,640
Nanny Tian is from the Fourth House.

662
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,160
Nanny Hua is from our house.

663
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,720
The remaining younger maidservants

664
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,080
were all meticulously selected

665
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,480
by your mother-in-law.

666
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,120
Respectfully greeting you, Big Madam!

667
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,080
Before leaving,

668
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,160
our Big Madam especially instructed

669
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,625
that since you've just moved into

670
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:37,640
your own manor not long ago,

671
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,675
there are a lot of affairs to handle.

672
00:29:38,675 --> 00:29:39,400
We must attend to you well.

673
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,120
I can be considered as the head steward

674
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,880
among these people.

675
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,960
From now on,

676
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,640
if any of them will do tricks to evade work

677
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,040
or hasn't done her task reliably,

678
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,280
Big Madam, just give the instructions.

679
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,840
I will take care of them.

680
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,280
Okay then.

681
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,800
Let's start distributing the work.

682
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,720
No need to rush.

683
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,600
Currently, the background of the people here

684
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,800
in the manor is too complicated.

685
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,680
I was too busy moving these past days,

686
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,875
and didn't find time to carefully

687
00:30:06,875 --> 00:30:07,760
check them out one by one.

688
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:08,720
Today, really good.

689
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,840
Let's do it along with the people

690
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,080
that Big Madam has granted us.

691
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,840
Interview them carefully first,

692
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,280
and then have them register their information.

693
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,200
We'll meticulously investigate their background

694
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:17,560
later on.

695
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,400
Big Madam, no need to be so troublesome.

696
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,880
I know very clearly

697
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,320
what these people from the Marquis Manor

698
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,720
I have done it before.

699
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,560
Just let me tell you

700
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,920
and categorize them.

701
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,080
Right?

702
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:30,960
Right. Right.

703
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,760
I have my reasons for saying that.

704
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,320
Just do what I said.

705
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,400
Brush, ink, and paper.

706
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,480
Let's start from you!

707
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,120
Greetings, Big Madam.

708
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,440
I'm Mingyue.

709
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,160
This name won't be good.

710
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,440
It sounds too similar to Big Madam's.

711
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,720
Go back and ask your parents

712
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,680
to change it.

713
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,960
No need to trouble her parents.

714
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,400
Let's just call you Chunyue then.

715
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,320
Yes.

716
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,120
How old are you?

717
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,280
Eighteen.

718
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,120
Were you born in the manor or bought outside?

719
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,880
Mingyue was

720
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,660
Chunyue was born in the manor.

721
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,480
My mother is Nanny Lai.

722
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,440
She was once

723
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,675
an accompanying maid of Big Madam

724
00:31:40,675 --> 00:31:41,400
of the Marquis Manor.

725
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,880
My father is the Marquis Manor's...

726
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,920
It's fine.

727
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,520
We'll know

728
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,520
once we ask Nanny Lai later.

729
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,400
Have you worked before?

730
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,280
I have.

731
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,280
I was initially chosen

732
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,680
to serve Third Young Master.

733
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,480
Third Young Master even frequently praised me...

734
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,560
Do you know how to read?

735
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,040
I know a little.

736
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,080
How much? Be specific.

737
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,400
Have you read The Book of Family Names?

738
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,600
How much of Poems of a Thousand Poets

739
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,000
have you read?

740
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,560
I haven't.

741
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,240
I haven't.

742
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,825
I have only read a bit of

743
00:32:15,825 --> 00:32:16,640
The Book of Family Names.

744
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,960
Have you been rewarded

745
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,440
with money, jewelry, or clothes?

746
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,400
Big Madam of the Marquis Manor has rewarded me

747
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,040
with a lot of new clothes.

748
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,320
She told me to come here and serve you well.

749
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,920
She even praised me...

750
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,240
Have you been punished,

751
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,160
scolded, or flogged?

752
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,480
What were the reasons?

753
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,360
Never.

754
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,480
You must think about it clearly.

755
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,360
You will be putting your thumbprint on this.

756
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,270
It's fine if you've committed

757
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,080
any minor mistakes before.

758
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,360
Anyway, you've moved into a new house now.

759
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,320
If in the future, I find out that you lied,

760
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,200
you'll immediately get expelled,

761
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,080
and never re-hired.

762
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,800
I only just got scolded

763
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,000
by the steward maid

764
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,040
in Third Young

765
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,240
Master's courtyard,

766
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,120
because I broke a few items of hers.

767
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,040
Other than that, there's nothing else.

768
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,440
Okay then. Just go place your fingerprint.

769
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,840
Go back and wait.

770
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,160
Yes.

771
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,000
If I want to use people,

772
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,200
I have to know your abilities,

773
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,680
what you've done before,

774
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,080
and how your performance was.

775
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,040
As long as you don't lie

776
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,360
or exaggerate,

777
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,900
you then will be able to work

778
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,720
for a long time here,

779
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,000
work in an honorable manner.

780
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,640
What Big Madam said is very reasonable.

781
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,760
People who came from outside

782
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,360
must indeed be investigated well.

783
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,560
But the few of us here

784
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,320
are old servants of the Gu Manor already.

785
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,800
Big Madam,

786
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,720
if you have any questions,

787
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,040
just ask me.

788
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,120
Nanny Lai, this is the second time

789
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,320
you interrupted me today.

790
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,720
I dare not. It's just that

791
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,640
I find your method

792
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,400
a bit rejecting what is near

793
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,080
and seeking what is far.

794
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,040
I'm afraid that you'll get tired.

795
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,280
I thought

796
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,800
that my elders sent you all here

797
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,720
to be my helpers

798
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,600
and not to become my ancestor.

799
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,800
Fifth Auntie and Sister-in-law

800
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,000
aren't even saying anything,

801
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,960
yet you keep interrupting without permission.

802
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,760
Are you trying to slap my face

803
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,840
or theirs?

804
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,560
That's not what I mean,

805
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,840
Who's the most respected here in the Cheng Garden?

806
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,000
It's Second Young Master.

807
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,480
Does he handle the household affairs?

808
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,720
Masters only handle external affairs.

809
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,200
Who manages the household?

810
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,640
It's you,

811
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,960
the main madam of this manor.

812
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,440
That's right!

813
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,960
Those who can't remember this point,

814
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,960
I'm unable to hire you.

815
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,920
Second Brother Ye's wife,

816
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,760
you are really so clever and eloquent.

817
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,840
At such a young age,

818
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,700
you can already try a case

819
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,080
like you're in a local court.

820
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,600
Fifth Aunt, you've overpraised me.

821
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,475
I heard that

822
00:35:00,475 --> 00:35:02,590
when His Majesty ascended to the throne,

823
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,175
he asked for the

824
00:35:03,175 --> 00:35:03,840
examination performance of government officials

825
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,550
for the past ten years

826
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,800
from the Ministry of Official Personnel.

827
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,880
To follow the ways of the Emperor

828
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,240
would surely be right.

829
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,560
Yes.

830
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,920
You're right.

831
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,200
I'm doing this

832
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,600
not to be harsh on you.

833
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,050
I just want you all to

834
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:21,880
execute my orders without failure.

835
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,800
When you do a task well,

836
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,120
you surely will be rewarded.

837
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,000
But if there are people who speak rubbish

838
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,880
and are disobedient,

839
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,440
I will also not spare you easily.

840
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,720
Nanny Lai,

841
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,440
I scolded you twice today.

842
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,840
Do you have any discontent?

843
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,400
I dare not. I was muddled.

844
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,120
Because I'm older,

845
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,000
I offended you, who is my superior.

846
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,840
Tell me then, did I do anything wrong?

847
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:47,400
Of course,

848
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,280
you can't be wrong, Big Madam.

849
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,240
Wrong.

850
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,680
I'm also human.

851
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,520
I will also commit mistakes.

852
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,680
But no matter how wrong I was,

853
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,520
you shouldn't have interrupted me publicly.

854
00:35:59,200 --> 00:35:59,750
You clearly know

855
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,000
that I just got married into this family.

856
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,680
My current prestige isn't enough yet.

857
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,760
Couldn't you have temporarily delayed it

858
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,160
and just advised me privately?

859
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,400
Do you have to slap my face in public?

860
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,720
I dare not.

861
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,240
Also,

862
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,200
if the matter is under your jurisdiction,

863
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,480
you should speak without reserve.

864
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,200
If it's none of your business,

865
00:36:19,207 --> 00:36:20,560
you had better keep your mouth tightly shut.

866
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,120
Our General's blade has no eyes.

867
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:23,850
He hates people

868
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,120
who show off their glibness

869
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,200
and people who stir up enmity the most.

870
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,280
If anyone breaks this rule,

871
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,320
please forgive me for I can't save you either!

872
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,120
Understand?

873
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,160
Yes.

874
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,240
Big Madam, take your time in leaving.

875
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,160
Take our time?

876
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,160
I think your Big Madam

877
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,200
is hoping that we will leave quickly.

878
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,800
You, Big Madam,

879
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,750
are the elder of our Big Madam.

880
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:49,510
She even wants to ask you

881
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,720
to stay for a meal.

882
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,120
I won't eat anymore.

883
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,640
I'm already full from anger.

884
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,040
How can I still curl up my intestines

885
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:56,960
and sit here and eat?

886
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,360
Big Madam, take care.

887
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,040
That girl has something.

888
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,800
How could an illegitimate daughter

889
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,560
of a low government official

890
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,360
have such knowledge and eloquence?

891
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,480
We're just leaving like this?

892
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,640
Shouldn't we watch

893
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,000
how she'll assign our people?

894
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,400
Didn't you understand the meaning of her words?

895
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,375
What things

896
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:25,480
that one should and shouldn't meddle in.

897
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,850
You think that she was saying it

898
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:27,440
for Nanny Lai to hear?

899
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,440
She clearly was saying it to me.

900
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,750
We are not

901
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,230
direct mother-in-law or sister-in-law,

902
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,400
yet we came here to order her around

903
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,200
and meddle with her business.

904
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,960
If I still don't leave,

905
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,800
I would have really become so shameless.

906
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,240
Let me say something that I shouldn't say.

907
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,600
We shouldn't have come in the first place.

908
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,400
On the first day after her wedding,

909
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,275
she already caused those two

910
00:37:48,275 --> 00:37:48,960
from the Main and Fourth House

911
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,200
difficulty in backing down with good grace.

912
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,640
She's indeed a fierce character.

913
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,000
What do you know?

914
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:54,600
I just came

915
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,200
to know her skills.

916
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,120
Now that we know how good she is,

917
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,320
we also know

918
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,320
how we should act from now on.

919
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,320
Since I entered the Marquis Manor,

920
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,840
I've been in charge of kitchen purchasing,

921
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,280
make-up purchasing,

922
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,800
looking after the inner courtyard,

923
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,360
and the scheduling of night shifts.

924
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,200
Also,

925
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,560
I'm in charge of teaching the new maidservants.

926
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,680
I'm able to do all that.

927
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,760
Didn't you then get demoted

928
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,160
from a nice job to a worse one?

929
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,920
Big Madam, you're joking.

930
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,840
If you were good in purchasing,

931
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,800
you wouldn't have been asked

932
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,560
to guard the courtyard.

933
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,120
If you have been good in guarding the courtyard,

934
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,200
they wouldn't have made you

935
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,680
in charge of the new maidservants.

936
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,240
I...

937
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,160
How come you

938
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,040
can't stay long in one place?

939
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,440
I've recorded it.

940
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,760
I...

941
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,520
Initially, I was sick.

942
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,480
Big Madam knew my case

943
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,360
and didn't let me do heavy work.

944
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,960
So that's the case.

945
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,040
Good thing, I've asked.

946
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,640
If not,

947
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,560
if I assign you

948
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,680
to do some tiring task,

949
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,520
won't I worsen your illness?

950
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,560
These past years,

951
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,840
I've already fully recuperated.

952
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,480
You are indeed loyal.

953
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,560
But my husband has a reputation outside

954
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,680
of loving his soldiers like they are his sons.

955
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,040
It's not good if in his house,

956
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,160
he's making the sick and weak do tiring work.

957
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,880
This will also affect his reputation.

958
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,160
How about you go home first and rest?

959
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,280
I've also recorded that.

960
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,040
No, no, Big Madam, listen to me.

961
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,000
Next one!

962
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,080
Informing Big Madam,

963
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,175
we're done interviewing all the people

964
00:39:44,175 --> 00:39:44,880
sent by the Marquis Manor.

965
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,680
Okay. You've all worked hard.

966
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,100
Once Big Madam

967
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,900
finishes reading all your profiles,

968
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,920
she'll distribute your work in a few days.

969
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,640
Yes.

970
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,640
Who's there?

971
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,000
It's me.

972
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,560
You scared me.

973
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,640
This is a restricted place,

974
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,920
why are you here?

975
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,680
I.

976
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,120
I'm used to be busy every day.

977
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,960
After idling, I feel so uncomfortable.

978
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,640
I then self-assertively

979
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,400
found things to do.

980
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,040
I remember that the Master has given orders

981
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:47,960
that his study is off-limits

982
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,960
to unauthorized people.

983
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,680
Good thing, he's not here now.

984
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,280
If he was,

985
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,200
he'd just cane you

986
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:54,960
and expel you out.

987
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,840
How about

988
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,640
I go to Big Madam's room instead?

989
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,320
I can go there to serve her.

990
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,800
I'm able to do cleaning

991
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,920
or laundry chores.

992
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:03,840
We've already said

993
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,525
that you all should just wait

994
00:41:04,525 --> 00:41:05,160
for your work distribution.

995
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,480
Why are you rushing?

996
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,720
Didn't you hear it clearly

997
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,200
this morning in Zhaohui Hall?

998
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,320
Once you are here,

999
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,320
stop using your past working experience

1000
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,960
in the Marquis Manor to show off.

1001
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,440
Just do whatever

1002
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,800
Big Madam says.

1003
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,280
If you still don't understand this principle,

1004
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,280
you had better just go back now!

1005
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:22,720
I got it.
