00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Episode 9

3
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,175
Weiruixuan

4
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,520
Now that Ru'er and Ming'er

5
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,400
have been listening to the nanny's teachings,

6
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,280
it has benefited them a lot.

7
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,400
Mo'er is the only one left alone.

8
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,920
She even told me that

9
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,080
she misses her younger sisters.

10
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,720
Then she can visit her younger sisters

11
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,630
after school.

12
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,680
Mother, you are right.

13
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,875
It's just...it's just back when at the academy

14
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,480
there was only a single male guest,

15
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,160
the Young Lord,

16
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,040
who is a good and righteous young man.

17
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,120
But now the Second Young Master Gu is here as well

18
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,480
and both her little sisters are not present,

19
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,670
I fear it's not convenient for Mo'er to be there alone.

20
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,260
You are right.

21
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,640
Let her stay in the house

22
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,400
and do embroidery then.

23
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,800
Why don't...

24
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,320
Why don't we let her study with her two sisters

25
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,625
with the nanny?

26
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,200
That day, she also went to the front hall.

27
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,020
Though I didn't punish her,

28
00:03:04,965 --> 00:03:06,525
we should let her learn too

29
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,800
so that she can change her bad temper.

30
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,960
That makes sense as well.

31
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,675
But why are you discussing these

32
00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:14,040
trivial matters with me?

33
00:03:14,725 --> 00:03:16,565
Your main wife should be handling this.

34
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,520
You two should make the decision together.

35
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,400
As long as you instruct Nanny Kong,

36
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,560
she will agree.

37
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,580
This unimportant matter should be left

38
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,840
to your main wife to bring it up.

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,360
Nanny Kong is our guest,

40
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,280
so she cannot overstep our rules.

41
00:03:57,775 --> 00:03:58,815
Wait a moment.

42
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,975
Nanny.

43
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,840
Nanny, look.

44
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,080
I brought Manniang here.

45
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,600
This is Manniang.

46
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,000
These are our two children.

47
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,840
The elder child is Rongjie'er.

48
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,840
The younger child is Chang'er.

49
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,920
Come.

50
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,720
Quick, say your greetings.

51
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,295
Hello, Nanny.

52
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,640
Xiaocui!

53
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,760
Take the children to the courtyard to play.

54
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,800
Go to play.

55
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,600
Yes.

56
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,880
Yes. Let's go and play with me.

57
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,240
Go and play.

58
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,280
Nanny,

59
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,400
I personally made these cakes.

60
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,600
Nanny is old and your teeth are not strong.

61
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,480
I specially made them soft, sweet and mushy.

62
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,040
Nanny, try them.

63
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,720
I'm a servant.

64
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,560
I don't have the blessing to eat cakes.

65
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,880
Then how about I give you a massage?

66
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,640
Don't.

67
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,320
Miss,you need not pander to me like this.

68
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,240
You only need to serve Second Young Master well

69
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,350
and I will be thankful.

70
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,075
Nanny.

71
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,760
Nanny.

72
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,880
Manniang is my woman.

73
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,075
She will eventually enter the manor of the Marquis.

74
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,200
If you want me to be your son,

75
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,725
she's your daughter-in-law then.

76
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,880
What do you mean, a wife?

77
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,275
Are you going to marry her as a legitimate wife?

78
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,725
If she can't be the legitimate wife,

79
00:05:39,725 --> 00:05:40,640
she can still be a concubine.

80
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,920
Manniang won't mind.

81
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,920
Younger Master, stop talking about such matters.

82
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,680
You have yet to marry,

83
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,600
but already found a lowly woman

84
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,440
and had two children.

85
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,900
I fear it won't be easy for you

86
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,320
to get married in the future.

87
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,680
I can lower my requirements.

88
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,800
I don't need to marry one

89
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,000
who's noble and from a distinguished family.

90
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,560
I only want a gentle and virtuous one,

91
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,400
who will allow her into the family

92
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,720
and give her a name.

93
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,250
As long as I can serve Second Young Master

94
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,400
at all times,

95
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,900
I don't care if I don't have any status.

96
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,320
If Nanny doesn't believe me,

97
00:06:19,825 --> 00:06:21,305
I'm willing to swear to the Heaven.

98
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,720
If I'm not sincere with Second Young Master,

99
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,560
may I be struck dead by thunder

100
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,300
and lightning!

101
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,440
Manniang, why are you making this oath?

102
00:06:30,825 --> 00:06:32,333
Rise.

103
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,250
If Nanny won't let me stay with you,

104
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,440
I won't get up.

105
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,200
You...

106
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,900
You are threatening me.

107
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,110
I wouldn't dare.

108
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,440
In order to stay with Darling Second,

109
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,200
and also for my children,

110
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,350
I'm willing to shoulder this accusation.

111
00:06:53,175 --> 00:06:56,495
You are great at tricking him well.

112
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,600
If you are happy to kneel,

113
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,525
continue to kneel then!

114
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,825
Nanny! Nanny!

115
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,500
Manniang,

116
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,800
rise. Rise.

117
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,360
Nanny has always been reasonable.

118
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,040
Since I was young until now,

119
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,600
I have never seen her so angry.

120
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,450
Let her cool down her temper.

121
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,240
Darling Second, Nanny doesn't know me.

122
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,925
You should know that.

123
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,080
Even if you are penniless

124
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,160
and out on the streets,

125
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,500
I'm willing to be with you.

126
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,960
Alright.

127
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,800
Nanny.

128
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,160
Nanny.

129
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,880
Nanny.

130
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,960
Look at these two children.

131
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,720
They are so well behaved.

132
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,400
It's only when I had them,

133
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,075
that I finally felt that I had a family.

134
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,900
It's not my place to criticize you

135
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,200
if you have a few mistresses out there.

136
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,880
Even if she's a singer,

137
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,080
if her character is good,

138
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,440
I wouldn't mind.

139
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,440
With the way she is,

140
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,500
what kind of family can she give you?

141
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,680
What's wrong with her?

142
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,320
The first thing she does was kneel and refuse to get up.

143
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,440
It looked sincere,

144
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,075
but in reality it's a threat.

145
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,025
How can this be considered good character?

146
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,320
Nanny,

147
00:08:50,275 --> 00:08:52,195
Manniang was just momentarily anxious.

148
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,275
I already told her to get up.

149
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,400
She wouldn't dare to threaten you.

150
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,450
She got up?

151
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,700
Yes, she did.

152
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,280
She got up when you told her to.

153
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,700
She wasn't willing enough to act until the end.

154
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,225
Nanny.

155
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,825
I'm so alone in the Marquis' house.

156
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,280
Luckily, I met Manniang

157
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,360
who could talk to me

158
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,975
and relieve my frustrations.

159
00:09:26,725 --> 00:09:28,605
Although she's from a poor background,

160
00:09:29,475 --> 00:09:31,115
she cares about me.

161
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,350
Even more so than the young Miss Qin.

162
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,080
I know it's because you have suffered,

163
00:09:41,675 --> 00:09:44,795
but you cannot put your hopes

164
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,825
on loose sand like this.

165
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,725
It will be even harder for you to gain a place

166
00:09:48,725 --> 00:09:50,325
in the manor of the Marquis in the future.

167
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,720
The way they treated my mother,

168
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,410
will I rely on them for the rest of my life?

169
00:09:59,075 --> 00:10:00,715
At worst, we can always split the House.

170
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,680
You must not.

171
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,480
You have yet to marry or start your career,

172
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,960
and your parents are still alive.

173
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,525
House-splitting would need to be addressed

174
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:09,375
in the Imperial court.

175
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,325
Then I will get married first

176
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,040
before I do that.

177
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,775
Let's leave this place

178
00:10:17,775 --> 00:10:19,080
where we are bound to get into trouble,

179
00:10:19,325 --> 00:10:22,005
and find a clean and quiet place to live.

180
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,560
It's all my fault.

181
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,760
I shouldn't have left you here and got back to Yangzhou.

182
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,980
If I was here,

183
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,040
I wouldn't have let you

184
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,080
suffer alone in the manor of the Marquis.

185
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,200
Nanny, don't be sad.

186
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,625
If Manniang gets a status,

187
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,600
and these two children

188
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,560
will have a family.

189
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,050
Ultimately they are my son and daughter.

190
00:10:56,975 --> 00:10:58,975
Look at how happy they are.

191
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,520
If they don't have a name,

192
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,175
people will call them bastards,

193
00:11:03,175 --> 00:11:05,135
then it would be my fault as their father.

194
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,370
The children are innocent.

195
00:11:10,175 --> 00:11:11,975
Nanny,

196
00:11:13,075 --> 00:11:14,280
you are the best!

197
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,450
I know you dote on me the most.

198
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,775
Tell that woman to bring her children

199
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,100
and live here.

200
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,775
Alright.

201
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:26,160
Manniang will do whatever you say.

202
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,120
You are taking the examination soon.

203
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,525
You shouldn't have wasted your energy

204
00:11:30,525 --> 00:11:31,870
on these things.

205
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:35,600
I will listen to Nanny.

206
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,200
Whatever Manniang or Huaniang,

207
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,200
I will supervise her on your behalf.

208
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,720
Fine. Whatever Nanny says,

209
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,330
Manniang must obey.

210
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,775
Regarding that matter,

211
00:11:57,775 --> 00:12:00,095
Mo'er wasn’t totally without any fault too.

212
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,280
If she were mature,

213
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,520
before her younger sisters went to the hall,

214
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,175
she should have advised them to go back first.

215
00:12:05,733 --> 00:12:07,075
She shouldn't have been sandwiched between them

216
00:12:07,075 --> 00:12:07,680
and went in there too.

217
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,280
I think Mo'er should also

218
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,360
go and listen to the Nanny's teachings.

219
00:12:16,575 --> 00:12:17,815
You are right.

220
00:12:18,675 --> 00:12:19,715
Since that's the case,

221
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,140
let's have Mo'er receive slaps on her hands first,

222
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:24,985
and go kneel at the shrine for a few days!

223
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,650
I will go and scold her soon.

224
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,920
In all matters, there are rules.

225
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,600
She should be punished if she commits a mistake.

226
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,625
After she's punished, she will learn her lesson.

227
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,380
This Nanny Kong is from the palace.

228
00:12:49,175 --> 00:12:53,575
She has a broader outlook, knowledge and experience than us.

229
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,000
Our daughters being able to receive her teachings,

230
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,600
it's a blessing.

231
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,960
Since this is the case,

232
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,440
you should treat everyone equally.

233
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,160
You must not favor one and slight the other.

234
00:13:05,475 --> 00:13:07,340
Who's favoring one and slighting the other?

235
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,200
The rule between the main wife and concubines

236
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,610
has been flipped upside down for decades!

237
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,040
Now that the Nanny is here to teach the proprieties,

238
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,775
that's useful for

239
00:13:14,775 --> 00:13:16,675
marrying into a rich and influential family

240
00:13:16,675 --> 00:13:17,300
in the future!

241
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,240
Initially, only Rulan

242
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,120
has the right to listen to her,

243
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,400
Minglan got to go due to the Old Madam.

244
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,800
But what about Molan?

245
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,040
By what right should she go too?Because that bitch?

246
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,320
Shut up!

247
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,040
You are the proper Big Madam.

248
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,675
How could you speak so viciously?

249
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,175
Can't you tolerate her?

250
00:13:30,175 --> 00:13:32,015
Mo'er is also a daughter of the Sheng family!

251
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,220
Nanny Kong is here.

252
00:13:42,325 --> 00:13:43,405
Nanny, you have worked hard

253
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,100
for the mediocre daughters of the Sheng family.

254
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,675
I have caused you to be tired.

255
00:13:47,675 --> 00:13:48,735
Please take a seat.

256
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,950
When I had just arrived,

257
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,600
I heard the both of you quarreling.

258
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,000
Sorry we may have incur your ridicule.

259
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,920
We have another daughter,

260
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,350
given birth by the Second House, the Concubine Lin.

261
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,925
She heard that you are here

262
00:14:06,925 --> 00:14:08,480
and also wanted

263
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,960
to listen to your teachings.

264
00:14:10,213 --> 00:14:11,225
Fine.

265
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,080
Before I came,

266
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,160
I already heard some news

267
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,400
that the daughters of the Sheng family

268
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,720
are highly-cultured and educated.

269
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,480
One is just as smart and beautiful as another.

270
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,720
I met the Fifth and Sixth Misses

271
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,480
for the past two days.

272
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,800
I have never met the Fourth Miss.

273
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,720
Nanny, you are long in the tooth.

274
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,400
How could I exhaust you?

275
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,320
Big Madam, no need to be so polite.

276
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,440
I can withstand this.

277
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,040
Now that I'm old,

278
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,920
I like it to be lively.

279
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,300
With one more child,

280
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,760
the lesson will be livelier.

281
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,600
Yes, that's right.

282
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,360
Since this is the case,

283
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,200
I will have to trouble you then.

284
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,875
No need to be so formal.

285
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,300
Look at how bewitching your mother's skill is.

286
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,900
That's how she got you in here.

287
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,960
Why are the both of you still standing here?

288
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,325
Didn't you see my table being squeezed over there?

289
00:15:34,325 --> 00:15:35,285
Move it here.

290
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,080
Greetings, Nanny.

291
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,000
Alright.

292
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,440
Nanny Kong, this is

293
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,440
the poem which I usually wrote.

294
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,560
If it's not written well,

295
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,250
please guide me.

296
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,950
Fourth Miss is flattering me?

297
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,400
Though I know a few words,

298
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,840
I don't really understand poems

299
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,050
and can't guide you.

300
00:16:22,925 --> 00:16:24,700
Nanny is too humble.

301
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,100
Fourth Miss. Since you are learning proprieties,

302
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,440
we are teacher and student then.

303
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,600
As a teacher,

304
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,080
if my words are too harsh,

305
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,190
Fourth Miss, please forgive me.

306
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,900
I wouldn't dare to.

307
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,360
If I commit any mistakes,

308
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,400
please punish me.

309
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,150
Go and place the table of Fourth Miss

310
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,430
at the back.

311
00:16:47,175 --> 00:16:50,575
Place it together with the other two young Misses.

312
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:51,840
Go now.

313
00:16:59,725 --> 00:17:02,625
Just couldn’t resist showing off yet failed.

314
00:17:04,275 --> 00:17:05,825
Fifth Miss,

315
00:17:06,175 --> 00:17:08,975
don't talk privately during lessons.

316
00:17:41,425 --> 00:17:43,325
Miss, are you still embroidering

317
00:17:43,325 --> 00:17:44,705
the drawing for Aunt Yu?

318
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,160
If you still don't read the Classic of Tea,

319
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:48,450
you won't be able to answer

320
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,485
Nanny Kong's questions tomorrow.

321
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,200
I already read it.

322
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,850
Why I remember that

323
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,025
you said you hadn't read it?

324
00:18:04,225 --> 00:18:05,705
These Fourth Sister and Fifth Sister,

325
00:18:06,925 --> 00:18:08,285
who can I get along easily with?

326
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,240
If they haven't read it,

327
00:18:10,575 --> 00:18:13,575
why do I still need to?

328
00:18:14,275 --> 00:18:15,350
I understand.

329
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,200
You are always the last person

330
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,840
to enter the class room.

331
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,425
Aren't you trying to appear unambitious?

332
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,500
Silly Xiaotao,

333
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,250
I really couldn't get up.

334
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,025
This is the letter delivered

335
00:18:34,025 --> 00:18:35,305
by the servant at the side gate.

336
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,850
Xiaotao.

337
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,070
My maternal aunt wants to come visit us!

338
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,240
These little tricks,

339
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,440
you used to be best at them.

340
00:19:08,675 --> 00:19:12,035
Why don't you personally teach ?

341
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,040
I don't like to eat such dense things.

342
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,025
Cloud feet are looser.

343
00:19:21,275 --> 00:19:22,375
I don't expect her to marry

344
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:23,595
a wealthy and influential man.

345
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,000
Find an ordinary man

346
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,320
and live a peaceful life is quite alright.

347
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,475
You taught her horseback riding and pot-pitching instead.

348
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,975
That pot-pitching

349
00:19:32,975 --> 00:19:34,925
was her mother’s doing.

350
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,940
My household is unruly.

351
00:19:39,675 --> 00:19:42,035
Yet I can still be the head of this house.

352
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,600
The others each have their own mothers.

353
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,975
If I am too wordy, I'd just offend them.

354
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,240
I think they are

355
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,180
not raised as good as the girl in your yard.

356
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:56,010
Great wisdom seem to be a bit foolish.

357
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,360
She's just honest yet not bright,

358
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,375
unlike the rest.

359
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,840
Elder Sister,

360
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,525
are you short-sighted?

361
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,560
Come, drink your tea.

362
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,675
From what I see,

363
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,175
the Sixth Miss from your household

364
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,550
is, in fact, the best.

365
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,880
She noted my important points

366
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,225
and wrote them down.

367
00:20:22,225 --> 00:20:25,075
I have taught many people

368
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,700
but such a child like her

369
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,625
is rare to see.

370
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:33,320
Whatever prospects she has in the future,

371
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,440
if others are to give compliments,

372
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,975
don't forget to say that I taught her.

373
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,400
She's just using a stupid method.

374
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,840
She can't remember it well,

375
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,425
that's why she wrote it down.

376
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,760
Look at her Fourth Sister and Fifth Sister.

377
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,200
They don’t need to bother

378
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,720
to write it down.

379
00:20:52,775 --> 00:20:54,495
How is this being stupid?

380
00:20:55,445 --> 00:20:58,280
One will forget after time passes.

381
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,450
She's being diligent in writing them down

382
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,675
to help her remember them forever.

383
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,900
Look at her writing.

384
00:21:07,925 --> 00:21:11,005
Though I worked very hard to teach her,

385
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,860
her writing still looks like chicken scratches.

386
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,800
It may not be written well.

387
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,520
What's crucial is the meaning behind it!

388
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,625
If we can't read it clearly,

389
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,945
it's fine if she can.

390
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,160
When she goes and listens to your teachings,

391
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,500
it's just like accompanying the Crown Prince to studying with you.

392
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,360
You don't need to spend time on her.

393
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,480
Just leave her be.

394
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,360
I say,

395
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,975
you are getting old and your heart is old too.

396
00:21:38,115 --> 00:21:39,875
Who's sleeping and who's awake,

397
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,425
you can't even tell now.

398
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,520
If this is the case, why did you even call me here

399
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,640
to teach them all these tricks?

400
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,800
Fine, I will leave.

401
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,280
I'm leaving tomorrow.

402
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,050
I'm taking my bag and going back to my hometown.

403
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,680
That is not what our Old Madam

404
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,600
meant.

405
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,040
I say, the Miss of you

406
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,960
is getting old

407
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,720
and she is ever more unambitious.

408
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,600
She can't even make any decision here.

409
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,000
You even detest the girl that you have raised in your house.

410
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,040
In my opinion,

411
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,800
if you detest her,

412
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,900
you might as well let her go

413
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,680
so it can relieve the frustration

414
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,240
in your heart.

415
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,400
Everyone says that you are the smartest.

416
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,320
I think the Ladies in the Palace spoiled you rascals too much

417
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,075
and got you a whole body full of arrogance.

418
00:22:24,075 --> 00:22:25,195
You dare scold anyone you want.

419
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,800
I raised her since she was little.

420
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,710
How could I not dote on her?

421
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,200
As for those two,

422
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,880
one is the child of the Madam,

423
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,525
the other is of the pampered concubine.

424
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,720
She only has this old woman holding her back.

425
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,040
Yes, I am the old one,

426
00:22:43,325 --> 00:22:44,245
the elder.

427
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,510
Everyone pay respects to me,

428
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,960
but I'm getting old.

429
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,400
Once I take my shoes and socks off tonight,

430
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,300
there is no guarantee that

431
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,320
I will see the light tomorrow!

432
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:57,710
Minglan is prudent and careful at home.

433
00:22:58,475 --> 00:23:00,595
You...you keep praising her!

434
00:23:01,175 --> 00:23:03,055
Will those other two girls feel secure?

435
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:05,775
The more you praise her,

436
00:23:05,775 --> 00:23:07,385
the more harm you will bring to her.

437
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,440
You said that I'm unambitious.

438
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:12,935
Yes, I am.

439
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:16,655
I'm too worried to not be careful.

440
00:23:17,275 --> 00:23:18,315
Not only do I bear it,

441
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,880
But also that Ming girl has had to bear so many things

442
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,040
because of me.

443
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:25,610
She never gives me any problem at all.

444
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:28,330
If I don't dote on her, who will?

445
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,040
If you want to leave, fine.

446
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,350
Just leave now.

447
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,375
Just act as if that I didn't know you

448
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:37,550
when I was in the Palace!

449
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,825
How would I know

450
00:23:45,825 --> 00:23:48,240
you have so much problems in your heart?

451
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,360
You...

452
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,160
Suqin, your tea is excellent.

453
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:56,665
I haven't drunk enough of it.

454
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,810
How can she kick me out before I drink enough of it?

455
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,040
No way.

456
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,000
Yes,

457
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,825
I’d like Nanny to taste my tea.

458
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,575
Elder Sister.

459
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,400
The water's boiling!

460
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,840
Be careful, Miss! Don't get scalded!

461
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,725
Luckily I didn't give you the twelve-piece jade tea

462
00:24:43,725 --> 00:24:44,810
your Eldest Uncle Sheng Wei gave us as a gift.

463
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,925
Mother, you came.

464
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,775
Mother, can you tell Nanny Kong

465
00:24:49,775 --> 00:24:51,575
to stop making me come to her classes anymore!

466
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:54,655
Why should I do that?

467
00:24:55,225 --> 00:24:56,705
It's too difficult!

468
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,160
Curtsy or small talk,

469
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,160
they're not too bad.

470
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,000
But tea brewing is too hard!

471
00:25:02,325 --> 00:25:03,565
Not to mention drawing a pattern with the tea,

472
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,900
I can't even get the foam to stick.

473
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,800
Yesterday I whisked too hard

474
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,080
and knocked over a tea bowl

475
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,675
and sullied my clothes.

476
00:25:11,725 --> 00:25:13,425
You dare to be bold to say it's difficult

477
00:25:13,425 --> 00:25:14,945
when you can't even make tea.

478
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:20,360
I'm different from those two concubine-born girls!

479
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,480
They need to pander to people to earn a place.

480
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,960
I am the daughter of a legitimate wife.

481
00:25:26,285 --> 00:25:27,525
No matter who I marry,

482
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:29,205
they should all think highly of me.

483
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,175
You are not allowed to talk about

484
00:25:31,175 --> 00:25:32,080
children of concubines again.

485
00:25:32,475 --> 00:25:33,475
Did you forget about your father?

486
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,050
Mother. Considering Eldest Sister’s state

487
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:41,560
in her husband's house,

488
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,040
I think that

489
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,360
marrying into high-class or noble families

490
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,000
isn't all that good.

491
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,840
You'll just be bullied or oppressed.

492
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,280
It's better to marry into a common family.

493
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,160
Even if it's the family of an official,

494
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,320
it's best if they're not more senior than father.

495
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,575
That way, I'll be able to stand tall

496
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,260
and be able to control things better.

497
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,800
Unambitious.

498
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,920
Listen to what you're saying.

499
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,975
Your maternal uncle's house has many generations

500
00:26:04,975 --> 00:26:05,760
of decorated military service.

501
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,120
How grand that is.

502
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,720
How can you be so unambitious.

503
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,275
You're failing all the efforts

504
00:26:11,275 --> 00:26:12,275
I put into planning you and your brother's future.

505
00:26:15,175 --> 00:26:16,975
No matter how good the plans,

506
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,700
if you can't live comfortably

507
00:26:20,925 --> 00:26:21,925
what's the point?

508
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,180
Do you still want your Brother Yuanruo anymore?

509
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:31,120
You want to take it easy,

510
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,380
then the one in Lingqige will get a windfall.

511
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:37,160
Miss, if you marry into a small family,

512
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,170
and the other marries into a grand family,

513
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:40,970
in the future, if other people talk about it,

514
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,900
people will not think that

515
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,180
you're actually a sensible young lady,

516
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,600
instead they'll think of you

517
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,680
as a daughter of a legitimate wife

518
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:49,550
who is even less capable than

519
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,510
a concubine's daughter.

520
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,920
Who said I'm unambitious?

521
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,575
Apart from acting innocent and pitiful,

522
00:26:55,575 --> 00:26:56,495
what else can she do?

523
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:57,770
That's right.

524
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,120
All these years,

525
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,600
your Father has been unfairly favoring

526
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,280
those two bitches in Lingqige.

527
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,950
Even if it's just for this, Ru'er,

528
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,720
you can not lose to Molan.

529
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,350
Just diligently study under Nanny Kong and

530
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,000
gain some abilities.

531
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,425
Pick a great house and marry into it,

532
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:15,625
then become a "Mandated Lady".

533
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,150
All so that you can avenge my indignity.

534
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,525
Look.

535
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,100
Is this that difficult?

536
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,500
Try it again.

537
00:27:39,025 --> 00:27:40,185
The color has been brought out.

538
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,600
You made a mistake when adding water,

539
00:27:53,025 --> 00:27:54,425
Which is why the foam dissipated.

540
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,600
I did it exactly according to what Nanny Kong taught me.

541
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,560
It's all because

542
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,720
it's not stated clearly in the book,

543
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,550
but she still makes us read it.

544
00:28:04,525 --> 00:28:07,725
The tea in the previous dynasty is "tea brewing",

545
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,700
but nowadays the tea requires you

546
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,975
to first make the tea paste,

547
00:28:10,975 --> 00:28:11,840
then whisk to make foam.

548
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,320
Of course the old books can't explain it clearly.

549
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,280
Nanny Kong wants you to read it because

550
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,720
she wants you to understand tea culture.

551
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,040
Only you could be so wooden-headed

552
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:20,535
to follow the exact steps.

553
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,600
Was it I or you,

554
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,480
Mother, who've listened to Nanny Kong's teachings?

555
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:27,850
If you think I'm block-headed,

556
00:28:28,425 --> 00:28:29,865
then why don't you come whisk it yourself?

557
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,960
Are your very smart now?

558
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,625
Do you think you are beyond reproach

559
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:34,120
Since you've had a nanny from the palace

560
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,800
to teach you a few things?

561
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,338
I am in no position to even teach you now.

562
00:28:37,338 --> 00:28:38,000
Very well!

563
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,520
Do it yourself then.

564
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:45,860
What's wrong?

565
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,150
Sixth Miss' Aunt Wei is here.

566
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,160
Aunt Wei, the meal has already been prepared.

567
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,840
I personally made barbecued lamb for you,

568
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,200
you should have it all!

569
00:29:02,475 --> 00:29:03,315
Miss!

570
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,360
Hello, Madam.

571
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,560
I'm Miss' personal maid,

572
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,240
my name is Danju.

573
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,240
If Madam needs anything,

574
00:29:11,575 --> 00:29:14,095
please let me know.

575
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,725
Let me help you with your bag.

576
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,280
Let's go, Aunt.

577
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,560
Xiaotao, start the meal!

578
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,450
Alright.

579
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:44,245
Just a moment.

580
00:30:28,975 --> 00:30:29,855
Aunt,

581
00:30:29,855 --> 00:30:31,455
we washed these ourselves.

582
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:32,495
They're clean.

583
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,060
If it's just some dust,

584
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:38,490
it doesn’t matter even if I ingest it.

585
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:43,400
But who knows what it might be?

586
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,050
Madam, what is this for?

587
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,400
Okay,

588
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,700
we can now drink wine

589
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,100
and eat with peace of mind.

590
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,630
Aunt, have some meat.

591
00:31:23,175 --> 00:31:24,735
Aunt, have some meat.

592
00:31:30,075 --> 00:31:30,955
I don't like light.

593
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:34,360
If it's extremely bright, I can't sleep.

594
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:35,375
Tonight,

595
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:36,975
put up some bed-curtains for me.

596
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,680
Yes. Madam,

597
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:43,530
we have prepared a guest room for you.

598
00:31:45,525 --> 00:31:48,125
I'll sleep with Ming'er tonight.

599
00:31:51,275 --> 00:31:53,850
You eat too, have some more.

600
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,620
Miss, good night.

601
00:32:27,225 --> 00:32:28,385
Madam, good night.

602
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,170
I'm leaving now.

603
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,700
You may leave us.

604
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,225
Ming'er.

605
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,080
Ming'er, come here.

606
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:47,960
What is it, Aunt?

607
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,760
Come here now.

608
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,175
Aunt, what's wrong with you?

609
00:32:52,175 --> 00:32:53,935
Why are you so nervous?

610
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,900
I just ran into Xiaodie a few days ago.

611
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,575
Who?

612
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,680
I was at Qionghua Taoist temple the other day,

613
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,160
to add incense oil for your Mother.

614
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,600
Coincidentally,

615
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:10,390
I bumped into your mother's old maid, Xiaodie.

616
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,920
Sister Xiaodie? Xiaodie?

617
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,160
How is she?

618
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,880
Xiaodie told me that she dare

619
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,240
to swear before the Taoist Saints

620
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,160
that she never stole anything from your mother.

621
00:33:23,525 --> 00:33:26,245
Someone must have placed those items in her room.

622
00:33:28,475 --> 00:33:29,275
Who was it?

623
00:33:32,275 --> 00:33:33,275
She didn't say.

624
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:36,165
She thought about it but couldn't figure it out.

625
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,120
Anyone is possible.

626
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,160
Child,

627
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,400
the Sheng family is like a bramble thicket.

628
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,560
You are all alone here.

629
00:33:47,075 --> 00:33:49,315
Heaven knows when someone might want to harm you!

630
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,240
Grandmother appointed all the people serving me.

631
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:54,590
They're all capable.

632
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,780
Aunt, don't worry.

633
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:02,090
Aunt, who do you think wanted to frame her?

634
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,130
What benefit would the person gain?

635
00:34:06,275 --> 00:34:07,515
Coveting her position?

636
00:34:09,275 --> 00:34:10,035
No.

637
00:34:11,475 --> 00:34:15,395
Serving my mother was a thankless job.

638
00:34:16,275 --> 00:34:17,835
What benefit would the person get?

639
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,550
It must have been maidservants and old nannies

640
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,470
was fighting over positions and favors.

641
00:34:24,025 --> 00:34:25,465
It happened so long ago,

642
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:26,915
how can we find it out?

643
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,460
Either way, there are too many intrigues in this house.

644
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,000
I'm worried about you.

645
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,560
That's why I'm here.

646
00:34:34,425 --> 00:34:36,345
Do not be careless or lower your guard.

647
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,160
When you eat in the future,

648
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,640
just do as what I did.

649
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,080
Test it with silver needles

650
00:34:41,375 --> 00:34:43,135
and rinse the wares with boiling water.

651
00:34:45,225 --> 00:34:46,985
You should be careful during the night as well.

652
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,200
You must check the items in your room

653
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,520
every two to three days.

654
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,160
Check if you've lost anything,

655
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,375
but more importantly check that

656
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,335
you don't have something extra.

657
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,225
Remember this.

658
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,000
I understand, Aunt.

659
00:35:04,475 --> 00:35:08,380
The person who framed her may still be in this house

660
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,240
or perhaps not anymore.

661
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:18,770
Aunt.

662
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,280
Who could it be?

663
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,538
I picked this piece of meat

664
00:35:31,538 --> 00:35:33,075
in Butcher Zhang's store.

665
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:37,950
It's good for both barbecuing or roasting.

666
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,640
Aunt has a good appetite.

667
00:35:40,975 --> 00:35:42,935
It even makes Grandmother's appetite better.

668
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,000
Greetings, Sixth Miss.

669
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,030
Ms Zhou.

670
00:35:50,975 --> 00:35:54,175
Miss, are you going to personally cook dishes again?

671
00:35:54,775 --> 00:35:55,415
Yes.

672
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,650
I heard that your Aunt was here.

673
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:00,050
Why haven't I seen her?

674
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,360
Aunt is from a farming family.

675
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,600
She's not very good at socializing

676
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,600
and doesn't go out much.

677
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,100
That's no good.

678
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,860
You must allow us to invite her to a meal.

679
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:13,650
We dare not trouble you, Ms Zhou,

680
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:14,890
we'll host her ourselves.

681
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:17,955
It's just an extra pair of chopsticks.

682
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,080
Miss, if you don't mind,

683
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,320
come over tonight.

684
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,400
We can have the most popular "Icy Custard" banquet

685
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,120
in the capital these days with Mistress Lin.

686
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,600
Ms Zhou, can you make the decisions

687
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,400
for Mistress Lin now?

688
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,660
But it's so inopportune,

689
00:36:32,425 --> 00:36:35,025
my Aunt is going back to Yangzhou tomorrow.

690
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,840
Why such a rush?

691
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,450
She should stay for a few more days

692
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,390
and have fun in Dongjing.

693
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,525
She should stay for a few more days.

694
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,240
She came to speak to me on some matters,

695
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,920
now that is done, naturally she'll head back.

696
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,740
Don't want things to go awry because of her late return.

697
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,490
I understand.

698
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,280
That Madam Wei came from afar.

699
00:37:15,575 --> 00:37:16,695
I wonder what she said.

700
00:37:17,525 --> 00:37:19,725
It must be something fishy.

701
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,340
Watch her.

702
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:26,630
Incense burning can teach one tranquility and calm.

703
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,400
Flower arrangement can best sooth one's feelings

704
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,450
and temper their character.

705
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,325
In learning these skills,

706
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:36,650
your bearing is only secondary.

707
00:37:37,325 --> 00:37:39,965
What's more valuable is cultivating your disposition.

708
00:37:41,855 --> 00:37:44,175
Beside you, you have

709
00:37:44,175 --> 00:37:46,375
the best quality calming incense.

710
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:49,510
If you control the fire well,

711
00:37:50,775 --> 00:37:54,175
a fingernail-sized piece can burn for four hours.

712
00:37:54,775 --> 00:37:56,855
The fragrance will last without dissipating.

713
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,140
You may all start preparing it.

714
00:39:57,475 --> 00:40:00,150
Sister, could you have forgotten

715
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,550
to place the silver divider over the coal?

716
00:40:02,625 --> 00:40:04,625
The coal has burned the incense.

717
00:40:23,775 --> 00:40:24,855
Xiaodie told me that

718
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,880
she dared to swear before the Taoist Saints

719
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,400
that she did not steal anything from your mother.

720
00:40:30,775 --> 00:40:33,175
Someone must have placed those things in her room.

721
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,725
Nanny, I'm clumsy.

722
00:40:46,725 --> 00:40:48,550
I will be done soon.

723
00:40:50,875 --> 00:40:52,395
Sixth Sister, don't get anxious,

724
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:56,385
this kind of thing requires focus and deft hands.

725
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,680
Those without the savvy

726
00:40:59,075 --> 00:41:01,675
will not be able to do it.

727
00:41:07,775 --> 00:41:09,120
Go away.
