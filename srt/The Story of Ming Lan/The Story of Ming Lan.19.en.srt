00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,900
The Story of Minglan

2
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,820
Episode 19

3
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,860
Nanny,

4
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,340
is it okay for you to have tofu today?

5
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,660
Okay, tofu then.

6
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,020
Buy a chicken too,

7
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,340
so we can make some soup

8
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,220
for Eldest Young Master and Second Young Miss.

9
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:15,820
I even asked Old Liu

10
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:16,940
to save me a fresh fish.

11
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,620
Let's go now.

12
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,180
Be good.

13
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,420
Don't worry.

14
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,420
We're going out

15
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:22,940
to play now.

16
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,620
Keep watch of them. Don't let them run around.

17
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:25,740
Yes, got it.

18
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,260
Seductress,

19
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,980
I won't leave this door one step.

20
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,860
Let's see what tricks you'll come up with.

21
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:01,500
Good! Good!

22
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,100
Look.

23
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,060
All these are high-quality goods.

24
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,260
These ones too.

25
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,860
Have a look.

26
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,180
All these fabrics are not bad.

27
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,860
Play here.

28
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:13,860
Wait for me.

29
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,060
Boss, help me watch them.

30
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,100
Okay.

31
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,100
I am sure it will deserve

32
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,060
Third Miss Yu's dowry.

33
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,260
Wait. Wait and I'll get it for you.

34
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:22,940
Wait here.

35
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,140
Aren't you Attendant Zhao from the House of Yu?

36
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:32,980
Greetings, Attendant Zhao.

37
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,340
It's my great fortune to meet you here,

38
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,740
since we'll be one family in the future.

39
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,540
Please give me the honor to have some tea with you.

40
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,620
What do you mean by saying "one family"?

41
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,620
I'm Xiaocui, a maidservant serving

42
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,580
the outside mistress of Second Young Master Gu.

43
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,700
It's rare to be meeting you here.

44
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,180
Let's go have some tea in the Fan House.

45
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,020
Once we're in the House of Gu together,

46
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,260
we should take care of each other.

47
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,300
Oh, so you're from that woman.

48
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,940
Your mistress is quite good.

49
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,220
By that time, it might be you

50
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,780
taking good care of me.

51
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,460
Why must you be this courteous?

52
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,660
My mistress is feeling uneasy.

53
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:05,740
She only wishes that

54
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,780
Third Miss Yu can accommodate her.

55
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:07,900
From now on, she surely will

56
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,580
attend to her day and night,

57
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,340
do her best to serve her,

58
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,100
and will not slack off at all.

59
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,180
This is a token from my mistress.

60
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,220
It's a good thing that your mistress is sensible.

61
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,620
Owner Wang, I'll just go to have some tea!

62
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,100
I'll buy your fabric later.

63
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,820
Okay. Okay.

64
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,100
Attendatn Zhao, after you.

65
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,140
Young Miss Rong and Young Master Chang,

66
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,140
let's go now. We'll go have

67
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,780
some fruits and snacks at Fan House.

68
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,660
Sister, are we going to Fan House

69
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,300
for some snacks?

70
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,060
Right. Let's go.

71
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,660
They are...

72
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,860
These are the children of my mistress

73
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:50,940
with Second Young Master Gu.

74
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:51,940
They are very intelligent children.

75
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:52,780
From now on, they surely will be filial

76
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,260
to Third Miss Yu as if they were her own children.

77
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,420
Your outside mistress

78
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,380
even dared to have children,

79
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,340
two of them?

80
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,700
Reputation is no big deal.

81
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,060
Big Madam,

82
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,860
we both have children.

83
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,420
You surely can

84
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,220
understand my feelings.

85
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,940
No matter what,

86
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,940
I can't let my own daughter

87
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,820
gamble the rest of her life.

88
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,260
Yes. Yes.

89
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,340
You surely know about

90
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,660
this outside mistress, right?

91
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,460
While you haven't cleaned up your own house yet,

92
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,620
you dare make a connection with our House of Yu.

93
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,380
Marquis,

94
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,100
our House of Yu

95
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,220
is after all

96
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,540
a family of scholars and educators.

97
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,700
Must we be humiliated like this?

98
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,860
Big Madam, you've said it too seriously.

99
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,180
That woman is just someone from the streets.

100
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,020
Once Third Young Miss marries into our house,

101
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,220
she'll be the official main wife.

102
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,900
If she wants to give her away,

103
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,180
sell her, beat her up, or scold her,

104
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,860
she can do that.

105
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,300
Right. She can do that.

106
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,140
You must be kidding me then.

107
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,540
No matter what her background is

108
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,340
or her status is,

109
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,300
whether she's being kept inside

110
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,660
or outside the house,

111
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,660
as long as she has been favored,

112
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,260
then she's a woman in Young Master's heart.

113
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,580
A lady from our house

114
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,580
hasn't entered your family yet

115
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,220
and we already have to manage

116
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,100
such a huge pile of mess.

117
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,020
Must we do so?

118
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,420
Of course, we can choose not to!

119
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,340
Let me put it in this way.

120
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,260
This mistress

121
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,980
is quite formidable.

122
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,940
This is not the first time that our House of Yu

123
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,100
suffered from her.

124
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,220
If she isn't cleanly disposed of,

125
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,740
our Yanhong

126
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,660
even if we are to care for her here in our house

127
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,900
for five more years,

128
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,940
our House of Yu can afford it.

129
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,860
What Big Madam means is

130
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,140
we have to get rid of the children too?

131
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,020
I don't really have any opinion.

132
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,300
It's just better

133
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,780
to make it very clean.

134
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,940
What Big Madam Yu said is right.

135
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,260
Just get rid of them.

136
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,460
Okay. We'll listen to you.

137
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,660
We'll get rid of her in a very clean manner

138
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,020
and let Third Young Miss

139
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,820
into our family without any worries.

140
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,420
Okay. With Marquis's

141
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,180
and your words,

142
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,860
I feel more at ease now.

143
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,180
How about this?

144
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,380
Let's have Second Young Master

145
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,140
come here to be our witness

146
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,180
and ask for his permission,

147
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,980
so that I can give my husband

148
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,180
some assurance when I go back.

149
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,180
Big Madam,

150
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,980
we already said that

151
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,660
we could get rid of her.

152
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,460
Yes.

153
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,500
Just be at ease.

154
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:53,940
Marquis,

155
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,580
I'm not a nosy person.

156
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,460
We also know

157
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,140
that your Second Son

158
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,060
is quite a famous person

159
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,940
here in the capital.

160
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,060
He is very independent!

161
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,580
If he doesn't agree,

162
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,420
let's not

163
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,260
waste our time anymore.

164
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,780
No wonder

165
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,220
Young Master came back to get these items.

166
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,740
They look nice.

167
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,060
All these were

168
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,060
my mother's dowry.

169
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,380
Most have been used up.

170
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,260
Only a few are left.

171
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,100
I'm thinking that since I'm getting married

172
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,060
and establishing my own manor,

173
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,540
it's better to

174
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,500
take these items back with us.

175
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,060
Later on, pick a few

176
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,660
and put them in the betrothal presents chest.

177
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,580
My mother would have wanted that.

178
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,620
Young Master,

179
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,260
this fabric

180
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,780
doesn't look good.

181
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,740
I fear that it can't be used as a betrothal present.

182
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,980
When did you

183
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,700
learn to be crafty?

184
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,340
From now on,

185
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,540
I don't have any "Little Mother" anymore.

186
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,420
This is for you.

187
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,620
I will never forget the great favor you did for me.

188
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,620
We won't give this away. Store it well.

189
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,300
Okay.

190
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,620
Second Young Master,

191
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,060
the Marquis is meeting a guest

192
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:02,660
in the front receiving hall.

193
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,500
He asks you to go there to give a response.

194
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,300
Father. Send away your outside mistress

195
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,100
and her children.

196
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,460
Send them away today.

197
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,540
What?

198
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,100
Darling Second,

199
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,660
Big Madam Yu has already known about it.

200
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,100
It's better that you send away

201
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,060
that lady and her children.

202
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,260
Only by doing that can your marriage

203
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,540
with the Yu family proceed.

204
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:34,860
Mother, don't rush.

205
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,820
Big Madam, you've already known

206
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,740
about Manniang beforehand.

207
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,100
Why did you suddenly visit here today?

208
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,180
If there are already two children,

209
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,860
that's another story.

210
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,900
Big Madam, let's talk in private.

211
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,500
Young Master, let's just talk here.

212
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,340
The Marquis and Big Madam Gu

213
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,300
can also serve as our witnesses.

214
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,260
May Big Madam investigate it wisely.

215
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,060
My outside mistress is weak

216
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,260
and can't take care of herself.

217
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:16,980
If I let go of her,

218
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,020
I fear that she might die.

219
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,740
In consideration of how the heavens takes pleasure

220
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,580
in the welfare of living things,

221
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,020
for the sake that

222
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,420
she has given me two children,

223
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,500
just let her into my house

224
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,700
and give her a status.

225
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,500
I'm willing to transfer three salt farms

226
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,140
under the name of Third Miss

227
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,980
as a compensation.

228
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,340
Three salt farms?

229
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,380
Indeed.

230
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,340
Each one earns nine thousand yuan a year.

231
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,020
May Big Madam please be merciful.

232
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,700
Young Master, if you hadn't said

233
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,780
those words earlier,

234
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,180
I still would have made you send

235
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,300
that woman and her children away,

236
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,260
and Hong'er would

237
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,140
most likely be married to you.

238
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,700
But after you have spoken those words,

239
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,860
I think we should

240
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,300
just cancel this marriage.

241
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,860
Why?

242
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,980
Three times nine is twenty-seven.

243
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,020
That's twenty-seven thousand yuan of silver,

244
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,620
all just to give her a status?

245
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,220
What do you mean, "outside mistress"?

246
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,540
She clearly

247
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,060
is your life.

248
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,540
But Hong'er is also my life.

249
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,540
In this muddied water of your house,

250
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,340
it's better that she not come anymore.

251
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,340
I'll take my leave.

252
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,020
Big Madam Yu!

253
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,820
Big Madam Yu, please stay!

254
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,780
We can discuss this matter further.

255
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:35,780
We surely will

256
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,900
send away the woman.

257
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,580
Second Son,

258
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,700
quickly agree with it!

259
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,140
Why do you need him to agree?

260
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,060
The order of the parents,

261
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,980
the advice of a matchmaker..

262
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,180
Servant! Servant!

263
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,100
What are you doing?

264
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,060
Take some men to

265
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,580
Tianshui Alley and bind that woman.

266
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,220
You can't!

267
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,660
Do you want that lowly bitch

268
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,460
or this

269
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,260
compatible marriage?

270
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,180
Father, she's not a lowly bitch.

271
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,700
If you don't send her

272
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,620
and her children away,

273
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,060
don't ever step into my house again!

274
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:31,860
If I'm not even able to

275
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,820
assume responsibility for this matter,

276
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,380
why should I

277
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,460
bother getting married?

278
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,420
You... This... Damn you!

279
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,540
Big Madam, Big Madam,

280
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,940
don't lower yourself to Second Son's level.

281
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,300
He's still a child.

282
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,940
Since my husband has already agreed,

283
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,380
then!

284
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,380
Then it surely will be done!

285
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,140
My husband has already agreed!

286
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,060
Kneel down.

287
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,540
Get on your knees!

288
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,420
You asked us to propose a marriage

289
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,020
with the House of Yu.

290
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,060
I thought you had mended your old ways.

291
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,660
What kind of house does Imperial Tutor Yu have?

292
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,460
A house of scholars

293
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,580
with a renowned clean and respectable reputation!

294
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,380
If you two are married,

295
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,420
our family will be rid of the reputation

296
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,740
of being a crude warrior family.

297
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,220
We'll be able to rise up with the scholars.

298
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,220
Such a good marriage fate.

299
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,540
But you're muddled because of a woman!

300
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,780
You're disobedient and unfilial!

301
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,420
Is it I who is muddled because of a woman

302
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,300
or you who are smart because of money?

303
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,100
Is it I who is disobedient and unfilial,

304
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:56,860
or you who never

305
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,140
really give me a chance

306
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,380
to fulfill my filial duties

307
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,500
to my mother for even a day?

308
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,340
If what you said is right,

309
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,100
your parents and siblings have all wronged you.

310
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:06,900
Is that it?

311
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,540
Was it then the wind or rain

312
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,980
that raised you

313
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,500
when you were born?

314
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,500
This house is the wind

315
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,580
and rain.

316
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,260
For so many years,

317
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,900
whatever I said was wrong,

318
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,620
whatever I did was a mistake.

319
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,660
Sometimes, I would think

320
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,940
that since you think of me as a sin,

321
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,860
why bothered giving birth to me?

322
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,100
If you're not a sin,

323
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,100
you think you're some reincarnation

324
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:41,620
of a Bodhisattva?

325
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,660
Go and search for the whole capital!

326
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,820
See if you can

327
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,180
find another house

328
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:47,740
with an unbearably naughty

329
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,300
and stubborn son like you!

330
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,380
You've already completely

331
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,780
tainted our family's reputation!

332
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,620
Stop right there!

333
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,740
How come you've

334
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,820
become such a scoundrel?

335
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,340
For a legitimate son of a highly-favored

336
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,700
meritorious house with a noble title,

337
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,300
there isn't even one house in the capital

338
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,660
is willing to marry their daughter off to you!

339
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,580
Your grandfather married off your mother

340
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,700
to our house exactly

341
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,700
because of

342
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,820
this noble title!

343
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:23,860
Aren't you disappointing

344
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,100
their family's plan?

345
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,260
Was it I who wronged her,

346
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,220
or your Gu family?

347
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,100
This house these pillars, tables, and chairs,

348
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,140
and the spear

349
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:39,940
you used to hit me,

350
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:40,940
all of them are still here

351
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,940
because of my mother?

352
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,380
In the past, she had such an extravagant dowry.

353
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,460
She could marry anyone she wanted

354
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,540
but finally into your Gu family.

355
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,300
You think that in this world,

356
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,460
only the Gu family

357
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,500
is a marquis house?

358
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,580
What the hell do you know!

359
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,140
One day,

360
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,300
when you're in my position,

361
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,620
when you're risking your life

362
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,260
just for your family,

363
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,540
you'll then understand

364
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,740
what it means to have hardship!

365
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,580
Life is uneasy.

366
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,100
It's been so many years.

367
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,660
Father, your life is hard.

368
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,540
Was my mother's life not?

369
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,620
She was carried out of this house

370
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,660
after being forced to die by others!

371
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,180
Who isn't carried out after dying?

372
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,980
Someday, when I die,

373
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,100
I'll also get carried out from here!

374
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,860
You keep saying that

375
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,620
it's for your mother.

376
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,340
With your current act of being

377
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,140
a young ruffian running amok,

378
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,540
a hedonistic son of a rich man,

379
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,860
you think your mother will be happy

380
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,740
if she see you?

381
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:39,740
When have you

382
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,100
treated me as your father!

383
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,940
Fine. Leave.

384
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,780
No, I won't leave.

385
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,740
Get out!

386
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,140
For so many years,

387
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,780
I've heard a lot of stories.

388
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,580
I don't know which one is true.

389
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,580
I wanted to ask you, but I didn't have the courage.

390
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,580
I wanted to ask you, but I didn't dare to.

391
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,100
Father,

392
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:31,020
today, I want an answer from you.

393
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,980
I don't want to tell you anything.

394
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,620
I don't want to even say a word to you.

395
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:39,740
I've already completely

396
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,140
lost hope in you.

397
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,100
Just do what you want.

398
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,660
Leave.

399
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,460
Father,

400
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:49,900
when I was little,

401
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,060
you've hugged me

402
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:54,900
and doted on me.

403
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,100
I won't trust others,

404
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,100
just you.

405
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,220
Today, before the heavens and earth,

406
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,980
tell me that

407
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,820
everything they said is false!

408
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,460
Father!

409
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,380
Father!

410
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,940
Have you ever missed my mother?

411
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,220
Even once is enough.

412
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,380
Have you ever thought

413
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,860
about that unborn child?

414
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,580
Once is enough.

415
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,620
Father!

416
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,620
Father!

417
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,180
Father! Father!

418
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,100
Sister, if you just leave like this,

419
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,100
then there will be really no hope

420
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,460
for Second Son's marriage anymore.

421
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,140
In this world,

422
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,900
being a stepmother is the hardest.

423
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,740
And you're even a softy.

424
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,140
This Young Master of yours

425
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,980
is like a demonic star incarnate!

426
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,140
Servant! Servant!

427
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:13,660
Darling Second?

428
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,020
Mother! Mother!

429
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:15,980
What's wrong?

430
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,780
Father,

431
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,900
he coughed up so much blood!

432
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,940
You can't blame me for that!

433
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:21,820
I'll take my leave now!

434
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,020
Go and get a doctor! Quickly!

435
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,660
Yes!

436
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,060
Darling Second!Darling Second!

437
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,260
Go and get Doctor Li of Renciji Pharmacy.

438
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,500
Hurry!

439
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:33,500
No, wait!

440
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,300
Go to the Imperial Medicine Academy

441
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,140
and ask for an Imperial physician.

442
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,100
Go quickly!

443
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:38,820
Okay!

444
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,700
Shitou!

445
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,780
Big Madam! Big Madam!

446
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,220
The situation is bad.

447
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,780
Eldest Young Master asks that you quickly go back.

448
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,620
I fear that a disaster will happen today.

449
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,460
Yes.

450
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,500
Be careful.

451
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:15,820
Father!

452
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,820
Father! What's wrong with you?

453
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,100
Father, wake up!

454
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,500
Wake up, Father!

455
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,460
It's me, your eldest!

456
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,020
Your eldest son is here, Father!

457
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:30,100
Marquis! Marquis!

458
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:30,700
Marquis!

459
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:32,700
Marquis.

460
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,580
Father.

461
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,420
Marquis.

462
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,420
Move aside!

463
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,340
Move aside, all of you!

464
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:58,900
Hurry up!

465
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:00,900
Thank you.

466
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,020
Shitou, take the doctor back to our manor first.

467
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:03,820
Okay.

468
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,460
Old Madam, hold on to us. Be careful.

469
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,780
How is my Elder Brother?

470
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,780
Elder Brother!

471
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:18,700
Slowly.

472
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,980
Elder Brother!

473
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,180
Father!

474
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,340
Father!

475
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,420
Eldest Brother, Mother!

476
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,540
Father?

477
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,180
Marquis!

478
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:45,940
Marquis!

479
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,580
Go away!

480
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,620
Let me in! I brought a doctor!

481
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,380
Move aside!

482
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,340
It's important to save the person!

483
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:01,780
Let me in!

484
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,740
Let me in!

485
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,220
I've brought a doctor!

486
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,260
Why won't you let me in?

487
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,020
Let me in! I've brought a doctor! Move aside!

488
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,020
Move aside! Move aside!

489
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,420
Let me in!

490
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,780
Let me in!

491
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,300
What are you all doing?

492
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:20,940
Who dares to block me!

493
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,980
I've brought the doctor!

494
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,420
They won't let me in, Young Master!

495
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,020
Get lost! Get lost!

496
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,780
Go away!

497
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,340
He fought outside.

498
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:51,940
Let me in!

499
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,940
Get lost! Let me in!

500
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:54,740
Let me in!

501
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,220
Move aside!

502
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,540
You even have the nerve to come back?

503
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,540
Why are you hitting me?

504
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,660
Why are you blocking my path!

505
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,660
Just for a lowly bitch,

506
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:14,580
you angered Father

507
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,340
to the point of coughing up blood!

508
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,540
What else do you want!

509
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,500
I've brought a doctor back!

510
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:18,820
Where is he?

511
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:20,820
Where is the doctor?

512
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,020
They were still here a while ago, Young Master.

513
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,260
I've brought a doctor

514
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,140
and an Imperial Physician!

515
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,380
We have a doctor in our house.

516
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,460
No need for you to worry about that.

517
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,700
If you dare anger Father again,

518
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,460
go in then!

519
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,420
What is the situation?

520
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,620
The inner courtyard has been surrounded so tightly.

521
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,460
I didn't see the two Masters

522
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,140
from the Fourth and Fifth Houses.

523
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,540
Even Old Madam Gu of the Third House

524
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,420
isn't making any move.

525
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,740
Has I been called?

526
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,500
Not yet.

527
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,740
Young Master, I feel that no one calling you

528
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,020
is a good thing.

529
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,140
Think about it.

530
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,900
If something bad has really happened,

531
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,620
they surely will call you.

532
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,660
Right.

533
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,060
You said it right.

534
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,660
Shitou, you said it right.

535
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,540
I'll just wait here.

536
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,700
So that when Father improves,

537
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,180
he won't see me and won't get mad.

538
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,940
Go now.

539
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,340
Have you heard about it?

540
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,220
Something major has happened at that Marquis Manor

541
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:11,780
at the side of the narrow lane

542
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,180
of Yujie Street!

543
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,060
All the officials have gone there.

544
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:16,900
What happened?

545
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,700
What has happened?

546
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,300
The Marquis coughed out blood

547
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,580
from being angered by his son.

548
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,620
That son got driven out,

549
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,340
but he charged in again.

550
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,980
That image was like

551
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,340
something being told by a storyteller!

552
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,220
It's like how they

553
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,060
capture pirates in stories.

554
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,100
Which son?

555
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,380
I don't know which one.

556
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,140
Anyway, he is a strong lad.

557
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,300
I saw him when I was passing by

558
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,140
after buying food from the market.

559
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,180
One against a group!

560
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,380
He almost got beaten up on the street!

561
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,700
I didn't know.

562
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,420
There were so many people looking.

563
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,340
There's even such a thing?

564
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,660
Was it Second Young Master?

565
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,260
Shut up.

566
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,980
Go in front and ask around.

567
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,740
Don't let anyone know who you are.

568
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,420
I heard that the Marquis has died.

569
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,020
What do you mean, "you heard"?

570
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,740
When I bought some jasmine flowers,

571
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,100
I especially went there to look.

572
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,260
They are now hanging white cloths on their gates.

573
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,100
What's the use

574
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,020
of being a rich family?

575
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,540
Having such an unfilial son.

576
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,740
Pity for that main madam in charge.

577
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,540
She's even just a stepmother.

578
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,820
Miss Qiu! Miss Qiu is back.

579
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,300
Did you find out any news?

580
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,780
Say,

581
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,740
that house is weird.

582
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,220
Don't know from where they come from.

583
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,060
I can't find Young Master

584
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:02,900
nor Shitou.

585
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:03,980
A white cloth was hung on the gates

586
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:04,380
of the Marquis Manor.

587
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,820
The Marquis is dead.

588
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,500
He's gone like that?

589
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,060
How did he die?

590
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,300
People in the streets are saying

591
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,500
that he was made furious

592
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,340
and died because of our Young Master.

593
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:18,940
Died due to anger?

594
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,900
Nanny, do you feel better?

595
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,900
Let's go to eat at Fan House tomorrow.

596
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,780
The dishes there are delicious.

597
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,060
Once you've eaten them,

598
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,300
you will feel better.

599
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,300
Little Miss Rong, if from now on,

600
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,860
we won't be able to

601
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,580
eat at Fan House anymore,

602
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,780
can you take it?

603
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,700
Why?

604
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,140
Why can't we go to Fan House anymore?

605
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,540
Nanny,

606
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,900
don't scare the children.

607
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,060
Whether I'm scaring the children or not,

608
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,180
you clearly know.

609
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,980
Just for you, Young Master

610
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,300
has been expelled out of Marquis Manor.

611
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,980
What remained

612
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,140
is just his surname.

613
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,940
For a place like Fan House where the dishes are

614
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,580
at least three to five yuan silver each,

615
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,420
you think we still can eat them?

616
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:15,700
What kind of status

617
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,580
does Darling Second Master have?

618
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,380
How could he let his children

619
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,500
not have anything to eat?

620
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,020
You grew up with a hard life in the streets.

621
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,020
I worked

622
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,340
as a nanny.

623
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,220
But our Young Master

624
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,420
was raised with a golden spoon.

625
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,660
He has never lived

626
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,940
as a commoner for a day.

627
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,140
Even if I have to work my old bones

628
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,340
to the limit,

629
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,700
to wash people's clothes and get them fire logs,

630
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,820
I will still try to provide Young Master

631
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,820
his deserved luxurious treatment.

632
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,780
You also should think about it.

633
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:50,020
Embroidery, sewing, selling vegetables,

634
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,340
or mending things,

635
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,820
see if you have any handy skills

636
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,580
that can earn us some money

637
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,700
to add to our living expenses.

638
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,340
Tomorrow, go over our bedding.

639
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,940
Go and gather any handkerchiefs, satin,

640
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,980
or leather you can find,

641
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,260
then sell them in the streets.

642
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,260
Darling Second is the legitimate child

643
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:09,740
of the Marquis.

644
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,260
Who dares to expel him out of their house?

645
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,180
Don't scare people.

646
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,060
If you don't believe me,

647
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,780
just ask him once he's back.

648
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,100
Have they called me?

649
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,060
Not yet.

650
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,940
That the servants

651
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,980
are asking if you're hungry.

652
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,820
How about I serve you food,

653
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,580
and let's just continue to wait after eating?

654
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,940
No, it's already dark.

655
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,660
Let's go.

656
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,820
Wait!

657
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,780
Stop right there!

658
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:05,900
You

659
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,020
Why are you dressed like this?

660
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,540
The Marquis, His Excellency

661
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,260
You!

662
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,780
With so many doctors,

663
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,180
not one was useful.

664
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,740
With you being so useful,

665
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,380
how could the doctors be of any use?

666
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,860
Move aside. Let me see.

667
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,460
Leave.

668
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,060
You're so useful.

669
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,060
Kill me in front of

670
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,340
your father's bed too!

671
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,900
Marquis

672
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,020
No

673
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,660
You've always

674
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,940
been so bold.

675
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,220
Your father was unable to control you.

676
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,260
I am unable to control you.

677
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,540
You should go.

678
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,700
You can go anywhere you want.

679
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,020
You can marry anyone you want.

680
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,780
From now on,

681
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,940
your Eldest Brother and I

682
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,020
won't say anything bad about you anymore.

683
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,260
Mother.

684
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,500
Mother.

685
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,940
I don't want to

686
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,020
listen to any words from him.

687
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,900
Leave!

688
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,660
Mother.

689
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,620
Look.

690
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,860
Look at this blood on your back!

691
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,540
Each drop is from your father.

692
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,060
Before he died,

693
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,420
he was even calling your name.

694
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,860
You indeed stayed outside

695
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,860
and wouldn't come back in!

696
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,660
You are so heartless!

697
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,220
No, it's not that I didn't come back.

698
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,060
Mother asked me to call the Imperial Physician.

699
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,300
When I returned, I got blocked off outside!

700
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:39,700
Auntie, I've been staying

701
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,980
in the side hall waiting to be called!

702
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:42,980
When did I ask you

703
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,300
to invite the Imperial physician?

704
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:45,540
Even if we're going to invite

705
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:45,940
an Imperial physician,

706
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,500
it should be Eldest Son

707
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,660
inviting him!

708
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,900
You angered your father

709
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,380
to the point of coughing up blood.

710
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,500
But not only did you not repent on your mistakes,

711
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,660
did not kneel by the steps to ask for his forgiveness,

712
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:06,060
you even ran outside

713
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,940
to get drunk!

714
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,780
You beast!

715
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,020
Beast!

716
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,300
Mother! Mother!

717
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,660
You killed your father!

718
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,660
You even dared to return to

719
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,580
our house to act atrociously?

720
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,380
Get lost. Get lost!

721
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,620
Quickly pack up your things and leave!

722
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,420
Not sending you to the local court to be sentenced

723
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,140
is already being lenient to you!

724
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,820
Mother, this is not true.

725
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,820
Stop pressuring Second Brother.

726
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:37,940
He just quarreled

727
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:38,740
with Father a little.

728
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,740
He didn't mean it!

729
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,500
Get lost.

730
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,100
Mother

731
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:49,940
You people want

732
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,580
You all want to

733
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,660
drive me out of the House of Gu?

734
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,580
You look at Father!

735
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,020
Look at him!

736
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,300
Not only are we expelling you out,

737
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:15,580
don't even think of

738
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,860
seeing Father's memorial tablet!

739
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,500
Don't even think of touching Father's tile basin

740
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,540
let me tell you, Gu Tingye!

741
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,900
It's because Father doted on you,

742
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,620
loved you, and indulged you,

743
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,980
that's why

744
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,500
he brought death to himself today!

745
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,020
If you can just obediently leave,

746
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,540
we'll just tell everyone outside

747
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,180
that you went out to travel.

748
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,380
This will preserve everyone's dignity.

749
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,140
Eldest nephew,

750
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,980
if this matter gets reported

751
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:41,900
to the government,

752
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,580
we will tell them the truth.

753
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,660
I fear that you and your mother's name

754
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,780
will get removed from the genealogy book!

755
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,340
They all said that being a stepmother was hard.

756
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,260
I pitied you for not having a mother

757
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,420
ever since you were little.

758
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,220
I doted on you

759
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,740
more than

760
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,740
I did on my own son.

761
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,140
Whatever you asked for, I gave you.

762
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,500
I covered for every mistake

763
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,420
that you've made.

764
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,860
The Marquis kept telling me

765
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:28,540
that a benevolent mother will harm her child.

766
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,940
He was right.

767
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,420
He was right!

768
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,620
Now that

769
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,500
you've committed such a huge blunder,

770
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,580
you even are pulling me

771
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,660
to lie with you?

772
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:49,140
Do you want me to continue harboring you!

773
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,980
Marquis, I'm the one who harmed you!

774
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,660
I'm the one who brought you harm!

775
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,380
Mother, stop saying it.

776
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,340
I understand.

777
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,540
When I was little,

778
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,980
you gave me whatever I wanted.

779
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,780
Whatever mistakes I made,

780
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,660
you helped me.

781
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,300
So

782
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,540
it seems you were Duke Zhuang,

783
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,180
while I'm Gongshu Duan.

784
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,980
You tolerated and nurtured an evildoer.

785
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,020
I understand now.

786
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,700
Second Brother.

787
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:45,780
Tingwei, are you involved?

788
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,260
What? What do you mean?

789
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,860
Okay. You're not involved.

790
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,700
She's the only one.

791
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:13,620
Second Son, if you have a heart,

792
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,500
bow to your father

793
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,300
by his bedside.

794
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:24,340
Treat it as paying respect.

795
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,420
Eldest Sister-in-law,

796
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,300
you are too soft-hearted!

797
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,460
In this house

798
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,060
every one of you

799
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,580
have been living your days by acting.

800
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,060
I've long wanted to leave.

801
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:00,860
You disgust me.

802
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,220
Since you don't want to live here,

803
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,140
Father also told you to get lost before he died!

804
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,780
Why are you still not leaving?

805
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:23,980
Father really said that?

806
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,340
You think he would still ask you to stay

807
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,380
and give you an inheritance?

808
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,100
Second Brother!

809
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,220
Second Brother, you

810
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:43,620
He's finally gone

811
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,500
Zhonghuai! Zhonghuai!

812
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:01,700
Zhonghuai!

813
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:04,780
Zhonghuai!

814
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,260
I heard about what happened to your family.

815
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,020
I immediately

816
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,740
What has happened?

817
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,380
Changbai

818
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,700
Zhonghuai,

819
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,060
you've let the wind blow on you the whole night.

820
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:50,340
It's already eleven p.m. You should go home.

821
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,980
Where else can I go back to?

822
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,940
I'll take you

823
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,260
wherever you want to go back to.

824
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,460
"The carriage travels

825
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,300
out of the royal palace of Ye.

826
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,860
Hunting by the bridge at the eastern ford.

827
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,860
Setting up a fine net.

828
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:32,620
Once released, it caught two hornless deer."

829
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:40,180
I have no place to go.

830
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,140
I caused my father's death.

831
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,540
I caused my father's death.

832
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,980
It wasn't you.

833
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,140
It was me!

834
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:55,900
From the start,

835
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,860
I hated him for being biased!

836
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:00,940
Afterward,

837
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,100
I hated him for killing my mother!

838
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,900
Every time I saw him,

839
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,380
I only wanted him to look at me

840
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,340
a little bit longer!

841
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,460
I wanted him to smile at me a bit.

842
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,260
But every time

843
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,780
we would end up arguing.

844
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,180
Only now

845
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:39,500
did I know

846
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,780
"Setting up a fine net,

847
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,180
a wicker trap floating like clouds."

848
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,900
That's why I'm telling you

849
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,500
that you're not the one who killed your father!

850
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:51,780
This is a net,

851
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:52,660
a bamboo trap!

852
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,580
Both you and your father

853
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,340
weren't able to see past it!

854
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:00,500
No.

855
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,180
I'm the one who killed my father.

856
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:04,820
You

857
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:07,460
This matter isn't the fault

858
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,580
of my stepmother and brother.

859
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:14,540
I don't have a father now.

860
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:17,820
I caused my father's death.

861
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:20,500
I also don't have a mother.

862
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,380
My mother is a monster!

863
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:27,660
I now don't have parents,

864
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,460
I have nothing anymore!

865
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,980
I have nothing anymore

866
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:40,180
Don't you still have a home?

867
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:44,620
In Tianshui Alley,

868
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:46,020
you still have a home.

869
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,620
Right.

870
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:58,420
I still have two children.

871
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:02,100
I still have a home.
