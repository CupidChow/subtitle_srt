00:00:55,159 --> 00:01:00,159
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:03,319
Episode 7

3
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,720
Move it there.

4
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,839
Hurry.

5
00:01:10,839 --> 00:01:11,760
Hurry!

6
00:01:16,279 --> 00:01:18,160
What are you cleaning for?

7
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:19,839
Second Young Master said

8
00:01:19,839 --> 00:01:20,760
he's already sent a letter

9
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:21,919
to have Nanny Chang who was in Bai family

10
00:01:21,919 --> 00:01:23,720
to come to the capital.

11
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,839
She's arriving today,

12
00:01:24,839 --> 00:01:26,360
so he said

13
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,400
to clean a room for her.

14
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,919
That Nanny Chang

15
00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:37,800
is just a wet nurse.

16
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:39,519
We haven't seen her for over a decade.

17
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:41,160
Why is she coming?

18
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,120
Nanny Chang hasn't seen me

19
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,400
for a long time and misses me dearly.

20
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,440
I grew up drinking her breast milk.

21
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,279
I can't be an ingrate.

22
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:54,199
If you truly want to repay her, that is a good deed.

23
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,599
Just give her some silver then,

24
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,720
don't trouble her to make the trip.

25
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,959
An elder leaving her hometown

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,080
will find it hard to adjust.

27
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,279
What's there to adjust to?

28
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,880
When my mother was alive,

29
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:09,880
this courtyard is where

30
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,679
Nanny Chang served her.

31
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,240
I think having her come

32
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,320
and be a chief maidservant is quite suitable.

33
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,240
She's just a wet nurse.

34
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,679
She wasn't even your mother's close maidservant

35
00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:21,119
at marriage.

36
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,199
What does she know?

37
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,520
How can she be a maidservant?

38
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,720
I think you should report it to Big Madam,

39
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,720
and have her arrange personnel for you.

40
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,399
I've already told Mother

41
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:37,919
about Nanny Chang's matter.

42
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,720
I bet you didn't tell her

43
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,000
that you want Nanny Chang to be the chief maidservant?

44
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,960
Your conduct is improper lately

45
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,119
and if she comes,

46
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,880
she'll help indulge you in

47
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,839
wine and women.

48
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,759
Father, why do you fret so much

49
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,720
over a wet nurse?

50
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,440
You try all measures to keep her

51
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,160
from coming into the manor.

52
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,639
How peculiar it is.

53
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,759
My Eldest Brother and Third Brother,

54
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:08,679
their courtyards' chief maidservants

55
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,880
are both wet nurses.

56
00:03:10,279 --> 00:03:12,199
How is it they can while I can't?

57
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,320
Is it because of

58
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,679
my mother's humble origins

59
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:17,759
so even my wet nurse

60
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:19,240
is lowlier than others?

61
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,520
Why every time I mention your mistakes,

62
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,520
you bring up these old matters

63
00:03:23,559 --> 00:03:24,960
to sing your own lament?

64
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:27,279
If you were learned and successful,

65
00:03:28,679 --> 00:03:29,399
wouldn't I feel assured

66
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:30,759
about whoever you choose?

67
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,039
I sing my own lament?

68
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,559
In this manor,

69
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:38,039
other than my mother and Third Brother,

70
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:39,080
who doesn't scoff at me

71
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,240
due to my own mother's humble origins?

72
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,160
Now I haven't learned to be good,

73
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,000
and you even blame the wet nurse

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,559
you haven't seen in years!

75
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,600
Fine.

76
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,119
Whatever Father says is right.

77
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,080
Since I was little,

78
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,320
no matter what I said or did,

79
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,479
it's all wrong anyway.

80
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:57,600
Then let me be wrong all the way!

81
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:07,039
You all stop!

82
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:14,360
You! Lock all the wing rooms

83
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,720
of this courtyard.

84
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:16,839
No one is allowed to live here!

85
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,760
Lock each and every one!

86
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:20,480
Just leave the room

87
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,440
for that vile thing to live.

88
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,200
I will see where he can arrange her then!

89
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,799
Father.

90
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,559
Why such anger?

91
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,119
Locking the doors in normal times

92
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:30,600
is a very ominous act.

93
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,359
May you reconsider, Father.

94
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:34,000
Ask your brother.

95
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:36,519
Ask him what great deeds he's committed.

96
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,880
My dear Second Brother?

97
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,119
He just set up a house for a woman.

98
00:04:42,119 --> 00:04:43,760
It's not such a big deal.

99
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,640
Many noble young masters

100
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,920
set up houses for their mistresses

101
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,359
and it's not just him.

102
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,799
I hope it's not the reason

103
00:04:49,799 --> 00:04:50,760
to harm the relationship of father and son.

104
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,040
A mistress outside?

105
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,519
When did he start to keep one?

106
00:04:53,799 --> 00:04:55,000
Don't be angry with

107
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,200
my dear Second Brother over this, Father.

108
00:04:56,799 --> 00:04:58,119
My dear Second Brother is young and confused.

109
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,399
Enticed by a singing girl is a common happening.

110
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,760
Singing girl?

111
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,040
So you are keeping a bitch?

112
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,359
You just couldn't contain yourself

113
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:30,440
and had to use the trump?

114
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,440
Speak! Did you or not?

115
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,200
I have.

116
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,000
I do have a mistress outside

117
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,920
and it's been many years.

118
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,760
Father.

119
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,119
Do you want to lock my room too?

120
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,839
You're not married yet

121
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,279
but you set up house with a mistress first.

122
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,720
Whose noble daughter

123
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,359
would marry you now?

124
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,480
With my reputation like this now,

125
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,880
even if I don't keep a mistress outside,

126
00:05:56,239 --> 00:05:57,000
no noble daughter

127
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,959
will marry me anyway.

128
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,440
Kick them out of Bianjing!

129
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,959
You are not to see her ever again.

130
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:05,959
Or else?

131
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:08,920
Or else I will beat you to death.

132
00:06:11,799 --> 00:06:13,359
Then beat me. Come on!

133
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,079
Beat me to death

134
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,279
and Gu Family will be all serene!

135
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,559
Dear Second Brother? You!

136
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:20,720
Dear Second Brother?

137
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:49,519
Your health is not good and

138
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,920
you just recovered from your illness a few days ago.

139
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,760
Why do you insist on coming?

140
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:54,959
What to do if

141
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,279
your get sick again?

142
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:59,000
I've been taking medicine since I was born

143
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:03,200
and it has been keeping my life till now ,

144
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,519
I'm only just subsisting.

145
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:08,440
I only hope my dear Second Brother can be a success.

146
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:11,480
So he can inherit the family business

147
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,160
and lessen your worries.

148
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,760
Don't mention that vile thing.

149
00:07:16,359 --> 00:07:17,320
If it goes on like this,

150
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,000
I'll never hand the family business

151
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,959
to him.

152
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,920
If he won't say

153
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,920
where that whore is kept today,

154
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,239
I will just beat him to death.

155
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,000
You can never do that.

156
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,040
Father.

157
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,000
My Second Brother is a Gu offspring no matter what.

158
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,440
If you keep up the beating, he will die!

159
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,799
Stop!

160
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,880
Dear Second Brother, concede now.

161
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:42,519
Admit your mistake to Father.

162
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,000
With an older brother like you,

163
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,079
I have many mistakes to commit.

164
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,480
What?

165
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,760
You pretend to stop the discord,

166
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,920
but in reality you want to expose to Father

167
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,399
that I keep a woman outside.

168
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:02,239
You colluded with those

169
00:08:02,239 --> 00:08:03,239
from Fourth and Fifth houses,

170
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,920
trying to find out

171
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,760
where I've arranged for the mistress.

172
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,959
You didn't achieve your goal

173
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,359
after many tries so you thought of this trick,

174
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,959
to have Father force me.

175
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:18,279
Stop.

176
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:19,760
Oh no. Stop.

177
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,160
My Second Brother is spouting on nonsense from the pain.

178
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,200
Stop!

179
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:25,720
I will tell you.

180
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,279
You don't need to bring the Third and Fourth House in.

181
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,079
Even if your elder brother

182
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,559
said it on purpose,

183
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:33,039
that's because you're dissipated,

184
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,080
and he wants you to repent.

185
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,039
Yet you frame him for that.

186
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,599
You are truly hopeless!

187
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,440
Father.

188
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,080
If I won't tell you even if I die today,

189
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,280
will you really beat me to death?

190
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,039
If it's not on the account that

191
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,559
you have the Imperial exam pending,

192
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,239
I would beat you to death today!

193
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:10,119
After the exam…

194
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:11,919
When the exam is over,

195
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,119
I will ask you the whereabouts of that whore!

196
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:30,119
Eldest Brother.

197
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,320
Long time no see

198
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,679
and your tricks are getting more skilled.

199
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,000
Forcing me to confess didn't work,

200
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:44,640
so you wanted to agitate Father

201
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,599
to beat me to death instead?

202
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:51,520
How great grudge do you have against me?

203
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,799
What crazy words do you speak here?

204
00:09:57,359 --> 00:09:59,840
You and I are not enemies.

205
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:05,320
Whether we are enemies or not,

206
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,159
you are aware in your heart.

207
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,080
Only

208
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,760
you didn't get what you want today.

209
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,640
I'm quite sorry about that.

210
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,640
There are many days to come,

211
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,440
so you can play more tricks on me later

212
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,200
Do it at your liberty.

213
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,520
I am thick-skinned and tough-fleshed.

214
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,200
Even if I get twenty strokes of beating every day,

215
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,320
I will still live longer than you!

216
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,799
You!

217
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,719
Nonsense!

218
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,520
Don't worry.

219
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,719
Father begrudges beating me to death.

220
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,880
Stop your dreaming.

221
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,080
Young Master, Young Master.

222
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,039
You're so soft-boned.

223
00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:17,000
I had to argue alone

224
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,159
with Father.

225
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,919
How can you said nothing.

226
00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:22,880
When you brought back Big Sister's betrothal geese,

227
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,599
you were mighty and fierce with pot-pitching!

228
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,239
So resolute!

229
00:11:26,239 --> 00:11:27,359
What happened to you now?

230
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:30,440
You were raised by Grandmother for a few years

231
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,080
and you become a soft-boned one like this now?

232
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:36,640
Fifth Sister, you said so many things,

233
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,479
but did Father believe a word?

234
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,000
When I testified for you,

235
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,960
and did Father believe a word of that either?

236
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,000
Fifth Sister, you're used to smooth days.

237
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:51,000
But since little,

238
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,080
I knew circumstances speak louder than people.

239
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:54,960
No matter what we say,

240
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,280
Father would believe her.

241
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,440
What's the use of saying a lot?

242
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,479
You're just soft-boned.

243
00:12:03,719 --> 00:12:05,200
Molan will ride over you forever

244
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,960
with the way you are.

245
00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:11,320
We are just having to kneel for a while now.

246
00:12:11,359 --> 00:12:12,880
If you spout a few more words,

247
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,359
and we will have to kneel for another three days.

248
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,479
Why then?

249
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,719
Do you want me to swallow my pride and endure this?

250
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:20,719
No way!

251
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:23,359
Molan, that little whore.

252
00:12:23,359 --> 00:12:24,320
Twisting the truth with lies.

253
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,479
We cannot coexist.

254
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,400
I will never give up!

255
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:34,640
Fifth Sister, listen.

256
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,159
How loud is the wind outside?

257
00:12:41,239 --> 00:12:43,359
We need to kneel here for three days!

258
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,280
And you're concerned about

259
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,719
the loudness of wind outside?

260
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:49,559
Silly Sister. If the wind is big, it will be cold.

261
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,880
Nanny Liu.

262
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:16,119
Is it 6'o clock yet?

263
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,359
Not yet.

264
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:19,679
It's still half an hour to it.

265
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,559
Has the Master

266
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,280
released Ru'er and Minglan?

267
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:26,119
Master went to court.

268
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:27,479
He's not back yet.

269
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:36,359
I won't sleep anymore.

270
00:13:36,359 --> 00:13:37,640
I'm going to go see Ru'er!

271
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:40,440
Even if you don't sleep,

272
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,919
Fifth Miss still needs to sleep.

273
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:43,880
Be careful

274
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,799
How can she sleep kneeling?

275
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:46,679
Hurry. Hurry.

276
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,799
Take it.

277
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,159
You may let Madam hurry a bit.

278
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:59,280
So many eyes are watching.

279
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:01,320
Nanny Zhi.

280
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,119
This house still belongs to Sheng.

281
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:04,599
and doesn't belong to “Lin”.

282
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,919
You misunderstand, Sister.

283
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:09,640
I mean, Master may know of this.

284
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:30,840
The Old Madam is so cold-hearted.

285
00:15:32,119 --> 00:15:34,359
Do you see how she dotes on that Ming girl normally?

286
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,640
She got whipped twice

287
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,119
and has been kneeling for fourteen to sixteen hours!

288
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:40,640
But the Old Madam doesn't even come to take a look?

289
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:43,320
Yes.

290
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,799
You didn't sleep soundly

291
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:46,359
at all last night.

292
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,359
But then again,

293
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,479
the Old Madam

294
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:51,880
isn't the Master's real mother.

295
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,760
So naturally she's not

296
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,159
the Six Miss's real grandmother either.

297
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,320
How much can she really dote on her?

298
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,359
Just putting on the appearance of it.

299
00:15:58,239 --> 00:15:59,400
What a relief that the Old Madam

300
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,719
didn't ask me for Ru'er back then,

301
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:02,039
or my heart

302
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:03,320
will be like being fried now!

303
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,159
The Fifth Miss is the legitimate daughter of Sheng's,

304
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:08,960
so the Old Madam wouldn't treat her the same.

305
00:16:09,239 --> 00:16:10,479
What's the difference?

306
00:16:10,479 --> 00:16:11,679
Even her own father doesn't dote on her.

307
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,080
Would her father's legal mother

308
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,919
dote on her instead?

309
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:22,799
Greetings, Mother.

310
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:26,599
How leisurely you are.

311
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:29,039
It's 6'o clock

312
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:30,280
and I don't dare to be lazy.

313
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:32,320
I am on my way to the study hall to study.

314
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:33,640
Where is Fifth Sister?

315
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:35,960
Why don't I see her?

316
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:39,039
Oh, I forgot!

317
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,320
Sister is serving the ancestors at the family shrine.

318
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:44,359
That's good.

319
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,080
It's teaching her a lesson

320
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:47,599
lest

321
00:16:47,599 --> 00:16:49,239
when she's at the marriageable age,

322
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:51,159
she will have a private meeting

323
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:52,559
with a male from the outside and shame our family.

324
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,239
Shut up!

325
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,880
You little bitch!

326
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:03,159
Why can't you hold your temper like this, Mother?

327
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,839
You'll have lots of anger to endure

328
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,839
in the future from Fifth Sister.

329
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,239
Yunzai.

330
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,079
Let's not be tardy to Scholar Zhuang's lesson.

331
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:12,680
Yes.

332
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:23,839
Speak.

333
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,160
Master has returned from court.

334
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,479
Did he say anything?

335
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,560
H-He went to Linqige.

336
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,040
You have been too harsh.

337
00:18:03,479 --> 00:18:04,959
Fifth Miss is so tender,

338
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:06,599
so is Sixth Miss.

339
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,079
She is the apple of Old Madam's eye.

340
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,599
If she kneels to be injured,

341
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:13,640
the Old Madam won't forgive you easily.

342
00:18:19,479 --> 00:18:21,479
It's just a matter of a maiden

343
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:23,119
stealing a look at a young man.

344
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,920
You can do that at the Dragon Boat Festival

345
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,400
and you can do that at the Lantern Festival.

346
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,520
It's not so bad.

347
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:33,959
Even Mencius said,

348
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:35,800
“A child will admire his parents.

349
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:37,479
But when he's conscious of the attractions of beauty,

350
00:18:37,479 --> 00:18:38,560
his desire is toward the young and handsome.”

351
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,839
Let it go.

352
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:41,640
Let it go?

353
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,719
If you don't teach and train her well now

354
00:18:43,719 --> 00:18:44,920
to have her temper fixed,

355
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:46,239
what will she become in the future?

356
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,199
Mother is the most reasonable

357
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:53,959
and understands discipline,

358
00:18:53,959 --> 00:18:55,119
so she will surely not blame me.

359
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,800
It's just that Minglan girl.

360
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,800
She's quite docile,

361
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,959
so this is a bit unfair to her.

362
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:06,599
But that Rulan.

363
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:08,599
Clearly she did something wrong, but she won't acknowledge it!

364
00:19:08,719 --> 00:19:09,920
She insists on framing Mo'er instead!

365
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,199
So let her keep kneeling.

366
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:16,359
But Fifth Miss is still young.

367
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,800
You should dote on her more.

368
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,439
Madam has sent someone here,

369
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:24,680
saying she invites the Master for a chat.

370
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,119
Quickly invite her in,

371
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:28,719
and tell her he will come right over.

372
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,839
You make my decisions now?

373
00:19:34,719 --> 00:19:36,800
I wouldn't dare.

374
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,040
Tell her to wait.

375
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:42,119
I'm eating,

376
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:43,079
and I have matters left to attend to.

377
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:56,199
You are just

378
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,880
too generous and merciful.

379
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:04,160
Merciful mothers ruin sons.

380
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,920
Your leniency is placed in wrong places!

381
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:08,760
When it comes to treating the children well or not,

382
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,160
it takes great consideration.

383
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,479
If there's a merit, you reward.

384
00:20:11,479 --> 00:20:12,400
If there's a mistake, you punish.

385
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,079
Or else, it's no different than ruining her.

386
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,719
You've taught your Mo'er well.

387
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,479
But we need the Madam

388
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:21,119
to teach her Ru'er well too.

389
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,000
What you said makes sense.

390
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,280
Master says he has matters to attend to

391
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:41,680
after eating.

392
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:43,160
He wants you to wait,

393
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:44,319
and he'll come when he's done.

394
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:46,599
In that whore's room?

395
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,640
Of course he's in that whore's room.

396
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,920
Where else could he be?

397
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,880
Madam, don't be mad.

398
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,239
She's just a seductress.

399
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:08,760
The house management rights

400
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,079
are still in your grasp.

401
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,479
Master is very angry,

402
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:15,280
and after his anger's dissipated,

403
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,199
it will be easier to beg leniency

404
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:18,839
when he comes then.

405
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,880
I never thought…

406
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:26,040
This family of prestige,

407
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,479
of generations of nobility,

408
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,040
would come to pampering of the concubine

409
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,439
yet slighting the main wife like this.

410
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,239
If I had known,

411
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,760
Mother really shouldn't have agreed

412
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,680
to this marriage!

413
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,760
I wouldn't have married here!

414
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:05,040
I already found out from the maids.

415
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,640
Sixth Miss is kneeling at the shrine as punishment

416
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,439
by Minister Sheng.

417
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:25,040
Madam.

418
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,239
Big Madam sent someone

419
00:22:28,239 --> 00:22:29,680
to Linqige to call the Master back.

420
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,719
But the Master was still angry and wouldn't go.

421
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,760
I saw the tonic

422
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,239
Madam got for Sixth Miss,

423
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,560
and indeed it's pretty good,

424
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,880
so Sixth Miss will suffer less.

425
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,479
Big Madam put some thought into it.

426
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,439
Our kitchen just said at noon

427
00:22:47,439 --> 00:22:48,599
they would send over the braised white jade fish

428
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:51,560
Sixth Miss loves along with jasper rice.

429
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,760
What she eats isn't important right now.

430
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:56,719
Send over a couple good pads.

431
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:58,760
She's just being punished accompanying others,

432
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,199
so she doesn't need to do this so seriously.

433
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,359
That child is just so honest.

434
00:23:04,439 --> 00:23:05,839
The other one's already lying down,

435
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:07,040
and she's still kneeling.

436
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,959
Tell her

437
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:11,239
not to be such a hardhead.

438
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,040
Earlier you said just let her kneel,

439
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:16,439
but now you care for her?

440
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,800
Go, go!

441
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,160
Master is here.

442
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,319
It's already lunch time.

443
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,000
You are indeed such a nobleman with so many affairs.

444
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,719
So many delicious dishes.

445
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:47,920
Salted meat and tofu with lotus seed stew?

446
00:23:49,239 --> 00:23:50,599
Great dish.

447
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,719
Add a bowl for me.

448
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:53,160
I'll do it.

449
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,119
These things are from Jinhua.

450
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,839
In this season, it's perfect for making it a stew.

451
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:08,680
Here, Master.

452
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:19,479
Master, try these dried bamboo shoots.

453
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,839
Caihuan came to me earlier

454
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:38,000
saying you wanted to speak to me.

455
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,640
You must be exhausted from work

456
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,680
and it's cold outside.

457
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,680
Have some hot soup and food with tea.

458
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:49,040
We can talk after you eat. There's no rush.

459
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:58,640
If it's about Rulan,

460
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,520
you needn't bring it up.

461
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,800
Rulan should learn a lesson.

462
00:25:06,479 --> 00:25:09,119
What does Rulan need to learn?

463
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,199
You just pampered her too much,

464
00:25:14,199 --> 00:25:16,040
and she's so spoiled and ruleless.

465
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,479
I ask her one question

466
00:25:17,479 --> 00:25:18,680
and she retorts with ten.

467
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,040
Not even half a sign

468
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,680
of a noble lady's poise.

469
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:26,280
Master, you are her father.

470
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:28,680
She respects and loves you.

471
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:30,560
She was wronged

472
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,119
and of course she would cry to you.

473
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,319
She's a tender little maiden,

474
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,479
and she's been kneeling for over twenty hours!

475
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,640
Her knees are black and purple!

476
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,479
Master,

477
00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:43,319
spare her this time.

478
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:45,239
I only wanted to have her

479
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,239
kneel for six or eight hours at first.

480
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,439
But she's scared of punishment

481
00:25:49,439 --> 00:25:50,640
and kept saying it was Mo'er's fault.

482
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,439
You see that?

483
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,280
She can lie with her eyes open.

484
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,319
How outrageous is that?

485
00:25:56,239 --> 00:25:57,040
Have her keep kneeling!

486
00:25:58,079 --> 00:25:58,839
If She kneels for two or three days,

487
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:00,079
naturally she'll admit her mistake.

488
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,079
you say Rulan is unruly

489
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:05,920
and wild.

490
00:26:06,719 --> 00:26:08,280
But is Hua'er mannered

491
00:26:11,719 --> 00:26:13,119
Hua'er could behave herself, of course.

492
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,079
Why are you mentioning Hua'er though?

493
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:16,280
Who didn't envy that

494
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,319
I had this great daughter Hua'er?

495
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,160
Back then, you described

496
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,119
Count Manor as so good,

497
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:23,479
and when they slighted us

498
00:26:23,479 --> 00:26:24,599
at the betrothal,

499
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,920
you said to endure it.

500
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:27,479
Since Hua'er got married there

501
00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:29,479
and she's harassed all the time by her mother-in-law

502
00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:30,359
who's biased against her!

503
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,439
Now she's already got

504
00:26:31,439 --> 00:26:32,920
four or five concubines crammed into her house!

505
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:33,520
This is

506
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,319
the great marriage you sought for Hua'er!

507
00:26:35,439 --> 00:26:36,520
Hua'er is Hua'er,

508
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,640
while Ru'er is Ru'er!

509
00:26:40,239 --> 00:26:41,119
What makes you think

510
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:42,079
I meant no good to Hua'er?

511
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,959
Yuan family is great in every way.

512
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:49,599
It's only that Big Madam Yuan,

513
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,439
she prefers that eldest son

514
00:26:51,439 --> 00:26:52,839
and disregards our son-in-law!

515
00:26:53,199 --> 00:26:54,319
That's what the problem is!

516
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,119
That elder Count of the Yuan House

517
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:58,640
is still sensible!

518
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,800
If you're talking about Ru'er, then stick with Ru'er.

519
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:04,119
Don't bring other things into it.

520
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,800
Hua'er is so considerate

521
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,479
and she knows how to run a house.

522
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,560
She is well known for it among the Bianjing ladies.

523
00:27:12,439 --> 00:27:15,400
Changbai is so young,

524
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,319
but already passed the provincial exam.

525
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:19,520
All your colleagues praise him.

526
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,479
Did those two children

527
00:27:22,479 --> 00:27:24,680
spring out of a rock then?

528
00:27:25,199 --> 00:27:27,719
They were raised by me,

529
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:29,000
one bit of poop and urine at a time.

530
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:31,599
You did indeed go through

531
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:33,199
three letters and six courtesies,

532
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:34,680
with the gate open

533
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,800
and welcomed me in as your main wife.

534
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:40,000
Master. Master...

535
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:44,160
Alright,

536
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:44,880
then rise.

537
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:48,839
I dote on

538
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:51,160
our Hua'er the most.

539
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,640
I toiled and fretted

540
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,959
to find a good marriage for her back then.

541
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:56,839
How could I have known the Yuan's

542
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:58,400
had that fierce and biased mother-in-law?

543
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:02,319
When they got married,

544
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:03,599
she put on such a good act.

545
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:05,520
We couldn't tell at all.

546
00:28:06,439 --> 00:28:07,439
Don't worry.

547
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:12,400
Alright.

548
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,160
Sit, sit.

549
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:15,800
Think about it.

550
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,839
Our son-in-law.

551
00:28:22,199 --> 00:28:23,160
Such a good person.

552
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,959
Patient and reasonable.

553
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,560
He's got himself a new post too.

554
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,479
A promotion!

555
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:29,560
Later on when they move out,

556
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:30,719
Hua'er will have her share

557
00:28:30,719 --> 00:28:31,760
of wealth and honor.

558
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,520
Right?

559
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:35,119
Master.

560
00:28:37,239 --> 00:28:38,160
Master.

561
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,119
You dote on Hua'er.

562
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,079
Then dote on Ru'er too.

563
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,800
How do I not dote on Ru'er?

564
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:52,280
You! You, how..!

565
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:53,719
How is it that

566
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:55,199
you just don't understand?

567
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:56,479
The Big Madam of Count Yongchang

568
00:28:56,479 --> 00:28:58,680
loves to arrange marital matches.

569
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,079
Rulan and Minglan

570
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,359
showed such discourtesy before her.

571
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,000
Now you just want to

572
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,040
let her go without punishment?

573
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:05,920
When the words spread later on,

574
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,800
what good family will come to seek marriage?

575
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,920
Don't you understand this reasoning?

576
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,319
My God.

577
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,359
These matters are supposed to be

578
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:18,520
your lot to toil over.

579
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,640
But now I'm having to put in the thought for you!

580
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:21,760
I really don't know

581
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,640
what you're doing!

582
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,760
The coquetry, it turns out,

583
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:49,079
needs natural talent too.

584
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:52,359
I, for one, can't do it.

585
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,520
I'm going to the Old Madam!

586
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,000
Madam is here

587
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,239
to inquire about Old Madam's well-being.

588
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,160
Oh my, it's so cold outside. why bother coming?

589
00:30:15,199 --> 00:30:17,239
And we don't need to abide by such common courtesy.

590
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:19,000
Mother.

591
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,199
What's wrong?

592
00:30:22,199 --> 00:30:23,920
Come, sit and tell me.

593
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:31,040
Mother.

594
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,599
May you persuade the Master.

595
00:30:33,479 --> 00:30:34,880
Spare them.

596
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,719
Take pity on these two maidens.

597
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,599
They were born in the lap of luxury.

598
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:42,760
They never had any of their skin rubbed raw.

599
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,520
Now they've been kneeling for over twenty hours

600
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,520
and their knees are black and purple.

601
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,719
The shrine is cold, Mother.

602
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,800
They are so tender.

603
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,479
How can they withstand the northern wind?

604
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,719
Minglan is shaking from the cold already.

605
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,000
May Mother please beg the Master.

606
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,599
How come you think I don't know what you said?

607
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,560
But I am still not

608
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:06,719
the Minister's birth mother after all.

609
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,400
I'm his legitimate mother,

610
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,160
and he's the head of the house.

611
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,239
It is not appropriate for me to be wordy.

612
00:31:15,719 --> 00:31:17,239
Let's not talk about legitimate or concubine.

613
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:18,640
Even if the Master's real mother,

614
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,479
Mistress Chun, were still alive,

615
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,079
you are still the legitimate mother

616
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:25,719
and the Master would never go against your words.

617
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,160
This is ash made by

618
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,040
mixing lychee shells in the incense.

619
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:31,520
Then you add the soaked wood.

620
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:34,520
And I think the aroma will be great indeed.

621
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,319
Whatever incense you make must be good.

622
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,400
Mother, anything else is fine.

623
00:31:47,479 --> 00:31:49,239
But Minglan,

624
00:31:49,239 --> 00:31:50,560
that girl is weak-boned.

625
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,280
How can she withstand this northern wind?

626
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:57,319
Minglan, if she had been practicing her writing

627
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:58,479
in her own room,

628
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,839
then nothing would have happened.

629
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,199
But she just had to go out and got involved in the trouble.

630
00:32:02,199 --> 00:32:03,599
Her father did right.

631
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:07,319
Mother.

632
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:09,760
Hua'er isn't living well at Yuan House.

633
00:32:10,239 --> 00:32:12,160
Ru'er suffers here.

634
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,479
My heart is like...

635
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,239
like it's fried by oil!

636
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:18,640
Hua'er's matter is on my mind.

637
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,640
Really?

638
00:32:21,479 --> 00:32:23,359
Madam Wu of Count Yongchang's Manor.

639
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,920
She didn't come for no reason.

640
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,760
Do you think she really came to see me?

641
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:31,680
She must have heard that

642
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,280
Old Madam Zhuang of He House of Baishitan

643
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,920
is coming to the capital.

644
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,560
So she came to inquire about it specially.

645
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:40,319
House of He?

646
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:41,920
Imperial Physician's Manor?

647
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,199
Indeed.

648
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:44,400
That Old Madam

649
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,479
is my bosom friend from my boudoir days.

650
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:49,079
Then, how is she linked to this?

651
00:32:49,959 --> 00:32:51,199
Her husband's family is the head

652
00:32:51,199 --> 00:32:52,520
of the Imperial Physician's Court.

653
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:54,359
Her maiden house' surname is Zhuang,

654
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:55,839
specializing in women's medical care.

655
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,599
Then that Old Madam

656
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:02,119
knows about women pregnancy?

657
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,479
If she can't,

658
00:33:04,479 --> 00:33:05,839
why would I urge her to come?

659
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,880
Usually, Hua'er is considerate of reputation.

660
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,119
And she is not at ease to invite a physician.

661
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:16,040
Once the Old Madam Zhuang of He House comes,

662
00:33:16,439 --> 00:33:17,520
we'll say I'm sick

663
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,000
and have Hua'er come home,

664
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:21,199
and we'll have it nice and tightly hidden

665
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:22,359
to get her pulse checked.

666
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:26,439
If the Count's Manor comes and troubles us again,

667
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:29,400
we'll show them our daughters

668
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,239
shouldn't be so easily bullied.

669
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,160
Thank the heavens and earth,

670
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,160
thanks Buddha and the Taoist Masters!

671
00:33:38,199 --> 00:33:39,079
As long as they are well cared for,

672
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:40,319
I am willing to do everything.

673
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:43,640
It's fortunate that we're all in the capital now.

674
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:46,239
Hualan has a maiden home that can hold her up.

675
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,040
With your care,

676
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,959
her days will flow as smooth

677
00:33:49,959 --> 00:33:51,760
as wind and water now!

678
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,599
Hua'er, of course I will watch over her.

679
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,640
Hua'er is prudent and considerate.

680
00:34:00,719 --> 00:34:02,479
She's so good,

681
00:34:02,479 --> 00:34:05,079
yet she suffers at the mother-in-law's.

682
00:34:05,199 --> 00:34:07,599
What about our Ru'er then?

683
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:08,879
Her temperament is coarse.

684
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,239
She can't withstand provocation

685
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,600
or any compromise.

686
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,399
And she lacks the consideration that Hualan has.

687
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,239
You ought to let her suffer

688
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,560
some bitterness at home,

689
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,080
so she's tamed and trained,

690
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,760
and so she can cultivate herself.

691
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,639
Ru'er is still young

692
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,520
and she's still got the temper of a child.

693
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:29,280
Hua'er's mother-in-law is prickly,

694
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,639
and that's that.

695
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,320
But Hua'er still comes up short

696
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,280
compared to the knowledge of the noble manor.

697
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,760
When it comes to floral arrangements and tea-tasting

698
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,120
and lighting incense acts,

699
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,280
her handiwork isn't proper.

700
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,120
That mean sister-in-law of hers

701
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,439
laugh at her mostly in these areas.

702
00:34:47,959 --> 00:34:50,159
Their family is a line of military officers.

703
00:34:50,479 --> 00:34:52,040
What elegance do they know?

704
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,479
They're just picking trouble.

705
00:34:54,919 --> 00:34:56,399
If you say so, that's wrong.

706
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,320
These petty actions.

707
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,520
Though they are not of any grand use,

708
00:35:00,879 --> 00:35:02,239
yet when it's in an aristocratic family,

709
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:03,760
it's a different story.

710
00:35:04,879 --> 00:35:06,840
It's already hard for Hua'er.

711
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,360
Just think how Ru'er can be spared.

712
00:35:08,879 --> 00:35:10,800
If it's really for the child's sake you have in mind,

713
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,800
you ought to grind that temper of hers down.

714
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,159
Mother, you mean . . .

715
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,679
When I used to reside in the palace,

716
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,199
there was a junior palace maid whose surname is Kong.

717
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,000
Nanny Kong of the palace?

718
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,080
Yes.

719
00:35:25,479 --> 00:35:27,479
If you don't begrudge Rulan,

720
00:35:27,479 --> 00:35:29,040
I will invite her to the house,

721
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,479
and have her teach the two girls some lessons.

722
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,600
If there's anything wrong they do,

723
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,800
we'll have Nanny Kong

724
00:35:34,959 --> 00:35:37,399
beat them with sticks all she wants!

725
00:35:37,479 --> 00:35:38,639
Firstly, to grind her temper down.

726
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:41,320
And secondly, we can regard it as a punishment.

727
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,879
Then that Master of yours

728
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:46,800
can't grouse anymore.

729
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:48,840
This is that tactic called,

730
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,320
besiege Wei to rescue Zhao.

731
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,040
Mother, you shouldn't be a lady

732
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,879
in the boudoir.

733
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:55,760
You should lead the soldiers for battle!

734
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,280
If you were a general,

735
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,239
then the Gaoliang River

736
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,879
wouldn't be in the hands of others!

737
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:03,560
Your mouth knows how to flatter too?

738
00:36:03,959 --> 00:36:04,679
Drink some tea.

739
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,840
Class again?

740
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:10,000
I don't have to go to the Academy Scholar's class,

741
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,199
but here comes a court nanny?

742
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:12,120
I...

743
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,800
Nanny Liu!

744
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:18,080
What a poor life I live!

745
00:36:18,479 --> 00:36:19,639
Nonsense.

746
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:20,679
This court nanny is someone

747
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,199
who served many consorts and noble ladies

748
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:23,560
in the Imperial palace.

749
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:24,719
Her knowledge

750
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:27,159
is much higher than many aristocratic madams.

751
00:36:27,959 --> 00:36:29,679
A bird can fly higher with the phoenix.

752
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,360
So go learn some palace rules

753
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,639
and practices from her.

754
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,719
Once you're married later on,

755
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:35,600
your husband and mother-in-law

756
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:37,199
will respect you more.

757
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,919
Does that really require a court nanny to come?

758
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:41,520
Grandmother was raised

759
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,600
in the palace for a while too.

760
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:43,879
Those rules,

761
00:36:43,919 --> 00:36:44,959
she knows them too.

762
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,760
Do you really want your grandmother to teach you?

763
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:50,840
No.

764
00:36:53,399 --> 00:36:55,120
Hurry and put away that lamenting face

765
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,040
and mouth of yours.

766
00:36:56,479 --> 00:36:57,239
After putting on the medicine,

767
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:58,879
go and bow to admit your misdeeds to your father.

768
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,159
You're not allowed to cry and whine.

769
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,239
Whatever your father says,

770
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:02,239
you'll listen quietly.

771
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:14,439
I don't know why.

772
00:37:14,439 --> 00:37:16,239
But Fourth Miss don't need to ,

773
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:18,719
go to this Court Nanny Kong's lessons.

774
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:21,679
Our Miss and Fifth Miss

775
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:23,520
were framed by her.

776
00:37:23,959 --> 00:37:26,439
But she got herself a reputation.

777
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,520
She doesn't need to suffer any punishment.

778
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,520
And she can go to the academy

779
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,439
every day and see . . .

780
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,679
You don't know if Fourth Sister

781
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:38,600
will still go to the academy.

782
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,040
Miss, what do you mean?

783
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:46,439
Xiaotao, gentler.

784
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,479
Here, let me do it.

785
00:37:48,479 --> 00:37:50,399
Your hands are not gentle. Let me do it.

786
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,560
Miss.

787
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,600
You need to think for yourself more.

788
00:38:17,439 --> 00:38:18,239
Academy Scholar!

789
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,719
Academy Scholar,

790
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:24,520
I've got a relative coming from Yangzhou.

791
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,719
These days, I'll need to go meet her at the dock

792
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:27,479
and settle her residence.

793
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:30,639
So I'll need to ask for leave for three days.

794
00:38:31,399 --> 00:38:32,320
Don't worry.

795
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,199
The lessons I miss,

796
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:34,600
I will catch up as fast as I can.

797
00:38:35,399 --> 00:38:36,679
On talent,

798
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:38,040
you are already outstanding.

799
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,439
You've passed all these exam within five or six years

800
00:38:39,439 --> 00:38:40,760
to get here.

801
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,600
But because you have this talent,

802
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,520
you ought to work harder.

803
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,760
However you have been missing classes many days.

804
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,360
and you have taken several leaves.

805
00:38:51,159 --> 00:38:52,840
If you are lazy in studying because you're talented,

806
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:54,639
when it comes to the Imperial exam,

807
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:55,679
you will lose out.

808
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,199
You are absolutely right.

809
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,479
But I am laboring with family business

810
00:39:02,479 --> 00:39:04,199
and I have no choice.

811
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,479
The Imperial exam is a grand matter in one's life.

812
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,879
No matter how busy the family affairs are,

813
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:09,439
you cannot ignore its priority!

814
00:39:10,479 --> 00:39:11,679
You're a smart man.

815
00:39:11,959 --> 00:39:13,360
Don't let yourself get so distracted

816
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,639
by outside matters.

817
00:39:14,879 --> 00:39:17,199
Or it will be too late to regret it later.

818
00:39:17,959 --> 00:39:18,959
Reconsider this.

819
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:22,120
Your words are like gold.

820
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,879
I will remember them by heart.

821
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,040
Alright, go.

822
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,399
Every family has issues.

823
00:39:34,959 --> 00:39:36,159
If this keeps on,

824
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,919
how few people can pass the Palace Exam in this house?!

825
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:51,800
Zhonghuai, don't worry.

826
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,080
I will take notes in detail everything

827
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,560
Scholar Zhuang teaches us these few days.

828
00:39:56,919 --> 00:39:57,879
I will send a manservant

829
00:39:57,879 --> 00:39:58,760
to deliver the notes to you.

830
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,399
No need.

831
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:01,679
I will have Shitou come fetch it at your home.

832
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:03,639
I don't know who's going to be at home.

833
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,360
If your item

834
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,320
falls into the hands of others,

835
00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:07,600
it will get either burned or trashed?

836
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,760
It's better I find one I trust to go get it,

837
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,639
so I can be at ease.

838
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,399
Is your home a tiger or wolf den?

839
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:16,560
Your parents and siblings

840
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,399
all scheme against their own family members?

841
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:19,840
How ridiculous.

842
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:22,760
I come from a tiger or wolf den,

843
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,040
then I'm a tiger or a wolf too.

844
00:40:24,879 --> 00:40:25,320
I am no longer

845
00:40:25,399 --> 00:40:26,919
the gullible child as before.

846
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,479
There is not a chance

847
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,840
If one wants to take advantage of me!

848
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,560
Then, you just be careful with all things.

849
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:39,040
You got beaten again?

850
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,439
Young Lord!

851
00:40:47,399 --> 00:40:48,159
What are you doing

852
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:49,520
with your head strained to the side?

853
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:51,199
I'm afraid your neck can't come back around.

854
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,199
How is it that the three maidens

855
00:40:57,199 --> 00:40:58,280
did not show themselves today?

856
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,560
Could it be that the three are all ill together?

857
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,919
Not that.

858
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,879
Our family invited a court nanny

859
00:41:05,879 --> 00:41:07,479
to hold lessons at home.

860
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:08,600
A Nanny from the palace?

861
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,280
Yes.

862
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,840
A few days ago,

863
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,399
the girls fell down in the front hall,

864
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,600
So my father thought,

865
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:16,919
it's better to invite someone

866
00:41:16,919 --> 00:41:17,879
to the home to teach them.

867
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,760
I was present then.

868
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:24,919
It's not such a big deal.

869
00:41:24,919 --> 00:41:26,199
You all didn't beg leniency for them?

870
00:41:26,439 --> 00:41:27,800
What's there to beg leniency for?

871
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:29,760
It's better to have them have lessons at home

872
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,080
instead of going to trouble to come to the academy hall.

873
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,080
Then they won't learn books anymore?

874
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,399
The daughters of officials in the capital

875
00:41:37,399 --> 00:41:38,479
do not practice that.

876
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,120
If you get to the bottom of it,

877
00:41:42,919 --> 00:41:44,919
it's my father that rules at home.

878
00:42:00,959 --> 00:42:02,360
Eldest Master's servant

879
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,399
is following us

880
00:42:03,919 --> 00:42:04,679
With this evading and hiding,

881
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:05,479
what is he trying to do?

882
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:06,800
I'll dismiss him,

883
00:42:06,879 --> 00:42:07,840
so he will be out of commission

884
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,800
for some eight or ten days!

885
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,399
He's just carrying out an order

886
00:42:11,399 --> 00:42:12,479
so you needn't do so.

887
00:42:13,479 --> 00:42:15,120
If we injure him,

888
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,560
it'll come to haunt us later.

889
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,760
That house can

890
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,959
make a fuss out of it.

891
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,280
What should we do then?
