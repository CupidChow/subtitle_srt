00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,114
Episode 67

3
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,960
That's Cheng Garden's direction.

4
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:32,920
It's not certain.

5
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,920
It's too dark out

6
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,800
and it's hard to see.

7
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,000
Lichong. Lichong!

8
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,080
Call all the male runners of the manor

9
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,920
and bring the fire extinguishing equipment.

10
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,040
All come with me.

11
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,680
Yes.

12
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,480
What are you going to do?

13
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,080
I will go to take a look.

14
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,760
Wife,

15
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,880
I must go and see it.

16
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,600
It's not even certain it is Cheng Garden.

17
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,480
Even if it is,

18
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,360
it's the marquis manor.

19
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,960
They will have their own fire rescuers.

20
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,760
Why is he still not here?

21
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,120
This is the inner courtyard.

22
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,400
He can't come in with runners.

23
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,720
That's right. You're right.

24
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,600
So I'll take a look outside.

25
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,000
Husband. Husband!

26
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,960
Push. Push.

27
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,160
I can see the baby's head.

28
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,760
What's wrong outside?

29
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,240
Nothing. It's nothing.

30
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,840
It's fine, Big Madam.

31
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,840
I see the baby's head.

32
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,400
Breathe and push hard.

33
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,200
I see the baby's head.

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,720
Lichong! Lichong!

35
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,160
Yuanruo.

36
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,520
Come, give me a bucket.

37
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,200
Yuanruo!

38
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,280
Where are you going

39
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,320
all in a fret?

40
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,440
Mother.

41
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,160
Cheng Garden's on fire.

42
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,240
I am going to help rescue.

43
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,800
You saw it,

44
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,680
the Fire House would have seen it too.

45
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,080
The fire rescue team will go there

46
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,400
so what can you do if you go there?

47
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,760
But it's already burning!

48
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,200
Don't forget your status

49
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,000
and position.

50
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,840
You are already married.

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,640
Running to the marquis manor in the dark.

52
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,440
What propriety!

53
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,280
Mother.

54
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,502
Am I supposed to watch our relative

55
00:03:24,502 --> 00:03:25,280
burned to death and not help?

56
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,120
Relative?

57
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,360
You deem them your relative?

58
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,960
We were a relative of Gu House.

59
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,000
Heng'er,

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,720
don't go.

61
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,440
Your wife might get scared seeing the fire,

62
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,360
so you stay with her.

63
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,640
You guys go. Go.

64
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,640
Father.

65
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,600
She's very safe at home.

66
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,440
Why would she need company?

67
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,200
I'm going.

68
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:41,960
Father.

69
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,000
Let me just go to see that

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,720
if she's fine and I'll be right back.

71
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,680
Can you block the mouths of the world?

72
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,360
Father!

73
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,480
When I needed to speak clearly

74
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,400
and directly to her,

75
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,400
I did not.

76
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,800
When I needed to wager all for her,

77
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,160
I also didn't.

78
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,120
She suffered so much gossip

79
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,000
and chilling words by my account.

80
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,280
Can't I

81
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,160
just go rescue her once?

82
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,240
She has her husband and you have your wife.

83
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,880
You go and it will just incite more tongue-wagging.

84
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,680
If that Gu Marquis were here,

85
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,480
I wouldn't need to go.

86
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,320
But she's pregnant

87
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,160
and her manor is on fire.

88
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,440
Mother.

89
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,640
we at least were once acquaintances.

90
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,800
And you've given her a bracelet

91
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,680
and told her to be my sister.

92
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,840
Mother,

93
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,080
even if it's just a total stranger,

94
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,240
would you bear to see them die

95
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,000
without helping?

96
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,720
Yuanruo.

97
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,280
Go!

98
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:22,840
Yuanruo!

99
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,880
Fire!

100
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,840
Help rescue fire.

101
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,720
Work harder.

102
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,520
Come.

103
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,960
The fire's getting bigger.

104
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,160
Hurry, hurry.

105
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,360
Harder.

106
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,760
Hurry and rescue the fire.

107
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,920
Hurry, hurry.

108
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,440
Push hard, Big Madam.

109
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,360
It's out. Out!

110
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,800
Big Madam.

111
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,440
It's out!

112
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,080
Oh, it's a boy.

113
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,200
A big fat boy.

114
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,880
Slowly.

115
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,680
Let me see him.

116
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,600
Bring him for her to see.

117
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,120
Here.

118
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,640
Here, Big Madam.

119
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,640
The baby is too cute!

120
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,160
Alright.

121
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,880
Alright.

122
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,880
Fat boy.

123
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,240
Everyone will get a reward.

124
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,040
Thank you, Big Madam, for the reward.

125
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,800
You all contributed!

126
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,120
Go die!

127
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,600
Come!

128
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,000
Move!

129
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,800
Move!

130
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,160
Move!

131
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,880
You shrewd!

132
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,160
You, you!

133
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,920
Move! Who dares to come!

134
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,280
Pull her away.

135
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,360
Move!

136
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,240
Master.

137
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,360
Minglan.

138
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,840
You're back.

139
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,040
I'm back.

140
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,840
You're back!

141
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,520
They said . . .

142
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,080
they said you were injured.

143
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,000
I . . .

144
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,600
I thought you died.

145
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,160
My heart shattered.

146
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,160
I'm back.

147
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,680
Everything's fine now that you're back.

148
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,160
Look.

149
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,520
Child.

150
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,000
Is it a boy or a girl?

151
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,240
What a big fire!

152
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,400
I don't know

153
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,080
how my sixth sister is doing.

154
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,120
She's pregnant too.

155
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,920
How is it?

156
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,240
Reporting to Big Madam.

157
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Words on the street say

158
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,640
Marchioness delivered a boy safely

159
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,240
and Marquis is back.

160
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,920
What? Delivered a boy?

161
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,960
Yes.

162
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,640
They say her due date was around now.

163
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,320
What a coincidence that the madam of Gu House

164
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,840
delivered today in the big fire.

165
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,640
And Gu Marquis even saved her

166
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,320
amid the big fire.

167
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,560
The words are spreading all over the streets.

168
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,080
That Gu Marquis came back just in time.

169
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,920
It's burned like this

170
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,680
and she can still give birth?

171
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,760
Look at Dad.

172
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,080
Look, how much he looks like me.

173
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,040
I birthed him. He looks like me.

174
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,840
He looks like me.

175
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,720
He looks exactly like me.

176
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,720
He looks like me.

177
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,040
In the future,

178
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,800
he will surely become a leader!

179
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,320
I already thought it through.

180
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,640
If this child likes martial arts in the future,

181
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,240
I can invite

182
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,160
as many martial masters for him as available.

183
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,960
If he wants to master in scholarship,

184
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,960
I plan to hand him

185
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,160
to your Second Brother.

186
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,240
My brother-in-law.

187
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,800
What?

188
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,160
You're going to hand him

189
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:40,760
to my Second Brother, Changbai?

190
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,520
You . . .

191
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,640
You . . . why would you?

192
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,760
How can you be so cruel-hearted?

193
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,080
This?

194
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,240
Why couldn't I?

195
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,520
My Second Brother's temperament.

196
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,680
It's not like you don't know him.

197
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,000
We can't bear to be hard on him

198
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,800
so we let another be hard on him.

199
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,280
Right?

200
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,960
When he's grown,

201
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,880
he'll surely hate you for some time.

202
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,160
He won't, right?

203
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,480
When did you get back?

204
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,160
I saw our house on fire

205
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,120
from the street .

206
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,880
So I rushed to come back on horse.

207
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,680
Yes.

208
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,880
The house was on fire.

209
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,760
I should have came back sooner.

210
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,040
How did Maternal Aunt Kang come in?

211
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,920
Someone must have used the chaos as an opportunity.

212
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,920
Rong girl. Where's Rong?

213
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,680
Rong is fine.

214
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,280
Xian girl is such a good child.

215
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,440
She saw the fire

216
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,720
and she disregarded her mother stopping her,

217
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,960
and sent all the hands

218
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,880
to come and help rescue the fire.

219
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,560
Now,

220
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,760
Rong girl is sitting well in her room.

221
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,880
Don't worry now.

222
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,360
They said

223
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,440
you met an assassin.

224
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,600
I was so scared.

225
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,080
Your darling Second is so brave and mighty.

226
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,520
A few assassins

227
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,680
have already been sent off by me.

228
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,680
So don't worry.

229
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,080
You just bore the child

230
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,440
so you should sleep well.

231
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,680
You don't go again.

232
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,360
I won't go.

233
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,360
I'm not going anywhere.

234
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,480
I'll stay with you guys.

235
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,560
Hurry. Get water.

236
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,560
Fire. Fire.

237
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,320
Here.

238
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,400
Here, come.

239
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,200
Fire. Hurry.

240
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,960
Fire. Hurry and come.

241
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,400
Don't rush.

242
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,680
Oh my world.

243
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,480
Tingwei? Third Young Master!

244
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,320
Tingwei?

245
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,520
Slow down. Don't rush.

246
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,360
Third!

247
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,760
Tingwei!

248
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,720
Third Young Master!

249
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,320
Tingwei!

250
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,360
Are you alright?

251
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,040
Third Young Master.

252
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,240
He's fine, right?

253
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,640
Thanks to Buddha.

254
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,160
Child, hurry and get up.

255
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,040
This might collapse and shatter on you.

256
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,080
I'll move out and set my own house.

257
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,440
Third Young Master!

258
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,360
What nonsense is this?

259
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,920
Big Madam.

260
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,520
Third Young Master's place

261
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,280
will need to be renovated.

262
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,800
Maybe he should go

263
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,600
and stay in Eldest Young Master's old place.

264
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,920
When I move out,

265
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,200
if you miss me, mother,

266
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,280
you can come to visit me.

267
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,320
If you don't want to,

268
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,080
never mind then!

269
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,160
Where are you going?

270
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,520
You, if you move out,

271
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,080
you won't come back?

272
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,680
I don't think I can live here any longer.

273
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,800
Third Young Master.

274
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,320
After I move out,

275
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,320
you and Second Brother can

276
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,240
fight if you want and quarrel if you want.

277
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,000
I have no say in it anyway!

278
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,560
And I don't care anymore!

279
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,680
Third Young Master.

280
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,560
I raised that child so diligently. Why is he . . .

281
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,920
Slower, Grand Madam.

282
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,160
Tingwei!

283
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,200
Third Young Master!

284
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,720
Mother-in-law, you really don't know

285
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,360
how our fire started?

286
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,000
I heard from Second House's report,

287
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,960
that the wind was strong and it started from a flicker

288
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,720
that flew over from the yard next door.

289
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,560
Next door?

290
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,960
I bet that flicker is very tall

291
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,840
and named Shitou.

292
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,160
What?

293
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,880
Gu Tingye! How dare you!

294
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,680
Mother-in-law.

295
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,680
I really don't know

296
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,640
if you are really devoted to my husband or not

297
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,960
To say it's fake,

298
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,440
yet you scheme for him with so much devotion.

299
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,520
To say it's true,

300
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,360
you've never cared what he wants

301
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,120
and what he needs.

302
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,440
Whatever he doesn't want,

303
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,240
such as the nobility title,

304
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,360
you must shove it into his mouth

305
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,160
to make him swallow.

306
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,280
Whatever he wants,

307
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,280
such as harmony with his siblings.

308
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,680
You just will never let him have

309
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,520
an ounce or second of it.

310
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,600
You spineless lot

311
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,760
with no aspiration!

312
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,520
I schemed for you all my life for nothing!

313
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,480
He's not a dog!

314
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,560
For you to raise him

315
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,520
however your like!

316
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,920
Miss. Miss.

317
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,800
Gu Tingye!

318
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,320
Miss.

319
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,040
Let's not be mad.

320
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,360
Alright.

321
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,160
Where's my child?

322
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,320
My child! Where is he?

323
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,560
Where's my child!

324
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,480
Tell Second Tu and Liu Jingli

325
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,240
to each guard one of the two inner doors.

326
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,240
The rest.

327
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,280
Child!

328
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,040
Child! Child!

329
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,360
Big Madam, your child's here.

330
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,320
He's here.

331
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,040
What's wrong?

332
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,280
Wife.

333
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,800
Wife.

334
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,920
I had a dream.

335
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,640
I dreamed a huge fog.

336
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,920
I couldn't find our child.

337
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,240
He's here, wife.

338
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,800
Our child and I are both by your side.

339
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,520
Don't be scared.

340
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,400
Your husband is here to protect you.

341
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,400
No ghosts or monsters can come to you.

342
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,600
I couldn't see.

343
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,880
Xiaotao.

344
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,400
Go light a calming incense.

345
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:51,720
Go.

346
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,560
I won't sleep.

347
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,120
I can't sleep.

348
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,840
I have to watch him.

349
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,160
Don't be scared.

350
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,160
Your husband is here.

351
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,480
I'll hold the sword

352
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,800
and watch over you two all night.

353
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,240
You sleep without worrying.

354
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,400
His Majesty isn't unreasonable

355
00:17:27,687 --> 00:17:30,120
to force Gu Marquis to leave his house at this moment.

356
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,240
It's just that he's so anxious

357
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,360
to hear about the salt matter from the marquis.

358
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,480
Sir.

359
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,400
The fire in the house

360
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,160
was only just extinguished.

361
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,560
The palace's imperial fire rescue

362
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,120
will be here

363
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,120
to allow Gu Marquis to go at ease.

364
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,520
May you deliver the words for me once again.

365
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,640
Sir.

366
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,800
It's not that I'm putting up air

367
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,440
to slight you,

368
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,240
but it's just that the madam's scared

369
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:56,560
and she can't sleep.

370
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,080
I can't sleep.
and she can't sleep.

371
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:57,320
I can't sleep.

372
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:57,360
Our marquis can't leave her side.
I can't sleep.

373
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,560
Our marquis can't leave her side.

374
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,760
Tomorrow morning he will go to the palace

375
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,600
to beg His Majesty's forgiveness.

376
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:07,320
Your marquis is intending to defy the imperial edict?

377
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,000
Sir,

378
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,360
my marquis has already wagered his life

379
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,600
for His Majesty and Prince Huan nine times.

380
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,440
Now that his wife had to labor in fire,

381
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,760
couldn't we be generous

382
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,960
and allow him to spend a night at home?

383
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,960
Prince Huan is back too

384
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,400
and if His Majesty wants to hear about the salt matter,

385
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,560
he could summon Prince Huan.

386
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,800
You!

387
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,600
Go safely, Sir.

388
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,600
You!

389
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,800
Your Majesty, it's time to rest.

390
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,680
Why isn't there any news still?

391
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,240
How is it? Where's Gu Marquis?

392
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,960
It was Cheng Garden of Gu Marquis that was on fire.

393
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,600
Where's Gu Marquis?

394
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,920
His servant said Marchioness,

395
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,280
Marquis' Wife，Madam Sheng,

396
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,560
was in labor.

397
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,400
She was traumatized

398
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,600
and thankfully Gu Marquis returned in time.

399
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,680
And now he's easing Madam Sheng

400
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,720
and watching the child.

401
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,640
I asked you.

402
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,600
Where's Gu Marquis?

403
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,800
Your Majesty.

404
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,440
I didn't even get to enter

405
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,480
the gate of Cheng Garden.

406
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,200
I didn't see Gu Marquis.

407
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,240
Child.

408
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,320
As soon as you came into the world,

409
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,520
you already met an evil robber!

410
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,760
Great.

411
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,480
This is a training for you

412
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,840
coming into the world.

413
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,840
Though it's warm inside the room,

414
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,880
it's windy and chilly outside.

415
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,280
It's great too.

416
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,200
This is the true image of the world.

417
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,320
We will all be by your side.

418
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:11,800
Your mother. Your father. Your older sister.

419
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,840
And your old brother who's gone.

420
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,800
We will all be by your side.

421
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,120
Good child.

422
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,880
This is the first day

423
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,040
you have come to the world.

424
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,520
The sky will become bright.

425
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,160
Gu Marquis isn't the same as before anymore.

426
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,320
I am an emperor waiting for him

427
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,480
to report to me about salt matters

428
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,160
and I'm still waiting!

429
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,320
Great for him though.

430
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,360
Clearly aware that I'm waiting for him.

431
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,240
He didn't come to the palace

432
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,120
and he didn't return the military seal.

433
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,640
He went home instead

434
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,360
to see his wife and child!

435
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,320
Your Majesty.

436
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,840
Gu Marquis had his home on fire.

437
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,360
He is worried about the disaster and it's understandable.

438
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,480
On the account of his past contributions,

439
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,720
please be forgiving.

440
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,040
Don't I pay heed to his contributions?

441
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,560
I sent him

442
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,320
the imperial fire rescue team,

443
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,960
to put them under his complete disposal.

444
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,840
No one else in the royal court

445
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,760
has that kind of honor.

446
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,560
How much more should I be kind to him?

447
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,760
Gift him the empire?

448
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,080
Your Majesty,

449
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,440
what do you mean by saying that?

450
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,760
Gu Marquis is a bit arrogant and unrestrained.

451
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,400
But be it the imperial jade seal

452
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,000
or the issues with my siblings,

453
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,680
or the salt patrol over the six provinces,

454
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,520
which matter does he fail

455
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,280
to succeed in full details?

456
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,400
In the future, we still need to count on him.

457
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,800
A few days ago,

458
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,040
we closed off the market in the frontier.

459
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,720
So they have to go the black market salt route.

460
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,840
And now, I've tightened on salt iron.

461
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,840
So they can't even find black market salt.

462
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,960
Their young chief

463
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,080
is a youngster who rose

464
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,760
with the support of his maternal uncle.

465
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,213
He's in a rush to start a war

466
00:23:21,213 --> 00:23:22,240
with us to mark his authority.

467
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,878
He's pressing us

468
00:23:23,878 --> 00:23:26,680
to open the market and give up land.

469
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,920
Our time is ticking.

470
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,040
We'll take it easy on Gu Tingye for now.

471
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,760
Once he's pacified

472
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,320
this big matter for us,

473
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,640
I'll deal with him then.

474
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,080
Your Majesty's health

475
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,960
is really unwell lately.

476
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,400
Headaches daily.

477
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,360
Imperial Physicians' Court came to look

478
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,640
but found nothing.

479
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,480
I think

480
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,080
since you were fine in Yuzhou,

481
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,800
and now that we came to Bianjing,

482
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,120
with so much work and worry,

483
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,040
it's rest that you need.

484
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,920
Your imperial health is more urgent.

485
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,160
You just watch me with headache

486
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,360
and illness day after day.

487
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,760
But who knows

488
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,760
what's really in your mind!

489
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,000
Your son is the eldest

490
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,240
in the palace.

491
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,480
Are you hoping direly

492
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,520
that I can go away a day sooner,

493
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,920
so your son can ascend a day sooner,

494
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,080
so he can have Gu Tingye

495
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,200
assist him a day sooner!

496
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,840
May Your Majesty be sage.

497
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,360
Your Majesty.

498
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,320
I am only devoted to you.

499
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,280
Ceying, that child,

500
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,440
also regards you as a God.

501
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,440
If Your Majesty suspects me ,

502
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,640
I can only use death to prove myself.

503
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,440
My health is just fine.

504
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,360
While we are not in war with the border yet,

505
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,320
I will knock down that obstacle

506
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,880
that is Empress Dowager first.

507
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,920
Or else my aspirations cannot be achieved.

508
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,520
And the borders can't be returned to us.

509
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,520
I won't have any face

510
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,040
to see my ancestors below.

511
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,120
Your Majesty.

512
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,240
Empress Dowager is well established and vigorous.

513
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,880
Your Majesty,

514
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,200
Noble Consort Liu is outside begging to see you.

515
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,360
She says she made some new snacks

516
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,680
for Your Majesty to try.

517
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,000
Let her in.

518
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,440
I didn't know

519
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,800
Empress was here too.

520
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,880
I think I made too few of the snacks.

521
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:00,960
It's alright.

522
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,360
Empress is going back soon.

523
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,680
I bid you well in leaving, Empress.

524
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,360
Yes.

525
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,280
I take my leave.

526
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,160
Your Majesty!

527
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,920
Why are you so mad?

528
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,320
Who got you angered?

529
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,080
Hurry now.

530
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,600
Send in the snacks

531
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,440
for Your Majesty to try.

532
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,520
Under the skies,

533
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,200
is there an older brother like you?

534
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,566
A prominent minister of the court.

535
00:26:45,566 --> 00:26:47,360
The emperor's esteemed subject.

536
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,680
You! You!

537
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,000
You sent your men

538
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,760
to your younger brother's yard,

539
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,920
to kill and set fire.

540
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,400
I . . .

541
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,960
I have to go to the emperor to report you.

542
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,000
I will go to His Majesty to report you.

543
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,960
Did that happen?

544
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,400
I never even heard of it.

545
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,520
I only know that

546
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,600
the fire in our yard was flown over from next door.

547
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,360
You . . .

548
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,800
That happened?

549
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,880
Yes.

550
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,200
I heard someone lit up sky light and it dropped.

551
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,160
The air is dry in the winter.

552
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,640
Better be careful of candles.

553
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,920
Yes.

554
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,480
I shall always be prudent.

555
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,240
You guys think you can just deny

556
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,000
and it'll be fine?

557
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,680
Let me tell you!

558
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,560
Someone from my yard saw it.

559
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,000
Your bride, Sheng woman.

560
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,560
Her maternal aunt, Madam Kang.

561
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,440
She came to your yard.

562
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,280
Summon her for me.

563
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,840
Summon her. I will talk to her face to face.

564
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,400
We compare our stories and the truth will be exposed!

565
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,680
She can't come.

566
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,600
It's so late.

567
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,440
What is it?

568
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,880
You're keeping the guest for dinner?

569
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,600
Enough!

570
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,120
Stop this act

571
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,560
of yours.

572
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,680
This Madam Kang?

573
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,840
She was staying just fine

574
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,040
locked up at Sheng House, ready for prison.

575
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,120
Why did she run into my yard?

576
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,520
You can tell me clearly on that.

577
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,400
Since everyone's well aware,

578
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,680
you still prepared your lines

579
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,080
to put up a show here?

580
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,000
Why don't you get yourself over

581
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,720
at South Tune House to sing your opera?

582
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,960
I'll tell you the truth.

583
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,360
The one from the House of Kang?

584
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,880
I already slashed her to death.

585
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,600
You killed her?

586
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,120
She wanted to kill my wife and child.

587
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,040
You repay a loan with money and repay a life with a life

588
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,840
Grand Madam.

589
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,560
What you're scheming about

590
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,640
I know very clearly,

591
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,800
but you guys don't know what I'm scheming.

592
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,640
Let me tell you.

593
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,720
In the future,

594
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,640
if anyone tries to harm our Cheng Garden,

595
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,680
what happened to the Wang surname is their ending!

596
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,200
She's a noble wife of an official.

597
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,960
You killed her?

598
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,960
Find two people to go

599
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,200
and carry her corpse out.

600
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,040
Grand Madam,

601
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,480
you think about a response to the House of Wang.

602
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,680
Grand Madam.

603
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,040
Grand Madam.

604
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,560
What are we supposed to tell the House of Wang,

605
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,400
Grand Madam?

606
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,040
Grand Madam.

607
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,000
So what if he's a marquis?

608
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,320
My Wang House isn't a nobody either.

609
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,560
I would rather just beat

610
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,440
that bastard to death now.

611
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,200
Lord Wang. Lord Wang,

612
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,520
let us hand it over for indictment.

613
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,800
He's heavily favored

614
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,920
by the emperor right now.

615
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,800
We bind ourselves together

616
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,720
and we're still no match to him.

617
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,920
He almost burned my son to death, too.

618
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,480
Then let him beat me to death

619
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,840
in your house!

620
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,400
Stop there!

621
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,960
Mother.

622
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,040
Mother.

623
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,120
Don't go. Watch your health.

624
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,920
Flesh that dropped from my body,

625
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,440
alive or dead,

626
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,400
I must see it myself.

627
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,280
Mother. Mother.

628
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:48,880
Mother.

629
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,280
Preserve your health, mother.

630
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,800
Old Madam, may your grief be consoled.

631
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,960
That Gu Tingye

632
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,760
is a devil like none other.

633
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,480
He almost killed my son, too.

634
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,920
These two cases of human lives.

635
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,040
What do you plan to do, Elder?

636
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,240
Me and our Gu House. We concede to you on all.

637
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
My house owes you for this kindness.

638
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,360
It's such late hour of the night.

639
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,080
My house has met with a matter of funeral

640
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,240
and we are not apt to keep you.

641
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,440
Eldest,

642
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,960
Mother, you walk her out for me.

643
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,320
Mother! This!

644
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,080
Old Madam.

645
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,920
Can it be that you're scared?

646
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,640
You…

647
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,720
I heard my daughter disturbed you

648
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,080
at the marquis manor for many days.

649
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,440
You've suffered exhaustion.

650
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,360
You should rest now.

651
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,080
Send our guest out.

652
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,040
So you're scared!

653
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,480
Old Madam Wang!

654
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,160
You're Old Madam Wang!

655
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,840
Your house is the House of Imperial Tutor Wang

656
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,480
who was granted to the Imperial Shrine!

657
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,360
The flesh that dropped from you died,

658
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,160
and you can't even care?

659
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,800
Grand Madam, this way.

660
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,440
Old Madam.

661
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,240
You have lots of children,

662
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,600
but I only have Tingwei.

663
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,240
You're scared of Gu Tingye's power

664
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,520
and you don't dare to report him.

665
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,120
I am not scared!

666
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,680
Trouble that courts disaster!

667
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,960
If that the House of Wang doesn't fare,

668
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,720
we will be quite low on power.

669
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,080
Ji'an,

670
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,960
have Fourth and Fifth House come to my hall.

671
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,600
Yes.

672
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,720
Go.

673
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,360
I told you many times.

674
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,440
Go rescue your younger sister.

675
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,000
Be it to snatch or rob her

676
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,360
when she's conveyed to the interior prison,

677
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,400
hijack her.

678
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,720
But look at how great you are.

679
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,440
Scared of wolf and tiger.

680
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,960
Today you say the plan isn't thorough enough

681
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,040
and tomorrow you say the guards are too tight.

682
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,560
Great now. She's dead.

683
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,400
You two got your wish.

684
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,200
You don't need to risk anymore.

685
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,400
Mother's words

686
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,040
leave no survival path

687
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,960
for us.

688
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,680
All these years, what was her conduct?

689
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,280
You should know that.

690
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,160
Our Wang House. That Sheng House.

691
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,320
And even the Sheng House in Youyang.

692
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,560
For this evil woman,

693
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,120
how many rotten cases did we all clean up?

694
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,560
How many lives were carried out of

695
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,520
her Kang House?

696
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,920
Dead from child labor.

697
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,240
Dead from beaten after breaking teacup.

698
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,840
The ones tossed out in hemp bags.

699
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,880
And this time as soon as we came back,

700
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,760
she used us to almost kill

701
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,480
the Old Madam Sheng.

702
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,360
Mother.

703
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,320
She was set out to ruin us all.

704
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,640
Now she's dead

705
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,880
and it's a relief to the whole family.

706
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,480
You are also a mother.

707
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,240
One rotten fruit that isn't picked out

708
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,040
will rot the entire basket.

709
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,040
Mother.

710
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,000
Your sister isn't a fruit.

711
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,440
She's your blood kin

712
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,040
from the same womb as you.

713
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:58,960
Mother!

714
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,880
Get out.

715
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,840
You are a thing

716
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,960
that only divides sibling love.

717
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,200
Enough.

718
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:07,960
You say nothing more.

719
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,720
Come.

720
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,760
Alright.

721
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,960
You go and have a rest first.

722
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,320
I'll discuss everything with mother.

723
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,360
Hurry. Escort the madam.

724
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,400
He really killed her?

725
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,640
I escorted the coffin back personally.

726
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,040
My Tingbing got exiled

727
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,800
a thousand miles away by him.

728
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,680
What else is impossible?

729
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,880
Of course he'll kill or harm

730
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,480
whoever he wants now.

731
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,160
The old madam from the House of Wang

732
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,720
asked me to give her an answer.

733
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,960
I am a widow.

734
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,000
What justification can I give to anyone?

735
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,200
He dares to kill the noble wife of an official.

736
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,680
He dares to kill his own brother.

737
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,400
Tomorrow, who knows whom he will kill?

738
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,520
It's always been the case

739
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:21,600
that the Madam Kang

740
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,520
would wrong someone.

741
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,160
No one's ever seen

742
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,880
anyone wrong her.

743
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:28,800
I actually don't believe

744
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,960
what you're saying.

745
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,840
If you want to investigate,

746
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,720
go ahead.

747
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,800
But I'm going to be upfront with my words.

748
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,520
Our house was snubbed

749
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,320
for years.

750
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,320
Finally we're getting some rising colors.

751
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,400
If this big tree falls,

752
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,920
and we lose our protection,

753
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,600
then in the future,

754
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,560
how will we live our lives?

755
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,720
That is something I'm not clear on.

756
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,040
He's cleaned up your house,

757
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,160
so of course you'd regard him

758
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,440
as your savior.

759
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,800
My house never had his protection.

760
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,560
Our Tingbing is exiled for ten years!

761
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,240
That's not how you say this though.

762
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,800
It was Tingbing

763
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,640
who rushed to write his name

764
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,600
on the Rebel Prince's roster.

765
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,520
And he even crossed out

766
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,680
our kid's name.

767
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,520
Shut up.

768
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,440
Womankind.

769
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,880
You all fled

770
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,960
and shoved it all on him.

771
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,800
Now you say he was snatching your merit?

772
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,720
Sister-in-law.

773
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,600
If you say that,

774
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,480
it's as though Tingbing

775
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,120
deserved to be

776
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,240
exiled by Second.

777
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,640
I was reckless.

778
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,960
Sister-in-law.

779
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,920
Please forgive me.

780
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,200
My sister ran out

781
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,160
by herself.

782
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,000
She should have come back right away.

783
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,000
So we could protect her.

784
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,160
She ran over to Gu House.

785
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,600
Then it's sending herself

786
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,680
into the net.

787
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,920
Your sister was heart-broken.

788
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,360
She was heart-broken that her brother, you,

789
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,840
and I, her mother,

790
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,840
couldn't protect her.

791
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,040
So she preferred to go to the enemy's territory

792
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,480
rather than returning home.

793
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,560
When she left, how despaired she must have felt.

794
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,840
This Madam Qin.

795
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,000
If she were truly good to your sister,

796
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,840
the first day she went to the marquis manor,

797
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,480
this madam should have

798
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,160
sent words to us.

799
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,000
Why did she hide it all along?

800
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,040
She waited until she is dead

801
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,920
to send the coffin over,

802
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,920
Saying it was Gu Tingye that killed her.

803
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,440
When he killed her, where was she?

804
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:03,320
Her marquis manor

805
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,080
is just an arrow away from Cheng Garden.

806
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,400
Just one wall apart

807
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,480
and she said she saw nothing.

808
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:11,880
You believe her?

809
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,000
She wanted to use my sister

810
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,440
as a weapon?

811
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,760
We can't

812
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,920
count on any of them, I fear.

813
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:30,920
Miss.

814
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,560
Did you see?

815
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,800
That Gu Tingye.

816
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,040
He is daring enough to burn Tingwei's yard.

817
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,600
Big Madam, don't be scared now.

818
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,040
He really wasn't trying

819
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:51,822
to kill our Third Young Master.

820
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,040
He just wanted you

821
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,600
to be busy rescuing him,

822
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,840
so you can't go and scheme against him anymore.

823
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:05,640
He's killed a noble lady of an official now

824
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,760
and he's ripped his face altogether.

825
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,000
If I don't eat up

826
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,720
this Gu Tingye,

827
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,880
then once the House of Wang gets a grip,

828
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,680
and they find out how many things I instigated in between,

829
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,920
they will eat me up instead.

830
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,920
It's not so bad if they ate me.

831
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,600
But what about my . . .

832
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,080
That foolish child of mine.

833
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,560
What will he do in the future?

834
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,040
I understand it all.

835
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,960
Since this is the path we're on,

836
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,800
there's only one of us to survive.

837
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,720
Go.

838
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,080
Go summon the House of Bai

839
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:05,800
from Yangzhou.
