00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,825
Episode 8

3
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,880
It hurts. Hurts.

4
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,240
Eldest Brother is so tenacious.

5
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,400
A few days ago,

6
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,600
he wanted to bribe my maidservants to his side.

7
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,160
He wanted to find out

8
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,280
where I set up my mistress.

9
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,560
I saw through his tricks.

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,900
And today

11
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,280
he's got you following me.

12
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,600
It seems Eldest Brother's tricks

13
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,360
are getting more and more skilled.

14
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,320
Second Young Master! Second Young Master.

15
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,040
I won't dare ever again!

16
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,200
You won't ever dare?

17
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,400
Then for what happened today,

18
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,120
what do you choose between a beating or a penalty?

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,360
I'll take a penalty.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,680
penalty? Fine.

21
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,400
Then you leave the Marquis Manor

22
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,360
and find your own survival means.

23
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,840
Never to speak to a Gu household member again!

24
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,720
Well, that . . .

25
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,680
What's wrong?

26
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,200
You can't part from the good fare

27
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,320
from the Marquis Manor?

28
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,400
Second Master, I'll go with a beating.

29
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,160
A beating, really?

30
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,240
Then take three punches from Shitou.

31
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,800
Shitou!

32
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,480
Alright!

33
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,160
Look carefully.

34
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,160
Second Master. I'll go with the penalty.

35
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,080
Here,

36
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,560
I'll leave the Marquis Manor today, right away!

37
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,960
No, I'll leave Bianjing City today

38
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,200
and never return!

39
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,600
We've beaten this one away

40
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,800
yet another might come soon.

41
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,480
We can only improvise with

42
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,720
what may come.

43
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,960
Kicking one away is one difficult solved.

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,160
Once I make my scholarly honour,

45
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,000
Manniang can see the light of the world.

46
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,480
Be careful of your own health.

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,200
Eldest, don't be so anxious.

48
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,080
Someone came to report to me

49
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,560
that the servant came back

50
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,160
and started to pack up right away.

51
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,800
He's asked to go

52
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,160
to our Gu ancestral fields.

53
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,800
It’s obvious that Second Brother

54
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,640
already discovered we had someone tracking him,

55
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,160
and we've alerted him.

56
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
In the future,

57
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,840
if we want to find that woman

58
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,480
he's keeping,

59
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,040
it'll just get harder.

60
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,320
And my health is like this.

61
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,240
I don't know

62
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,920
if i can make it through the end of the year.

63
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,960
How can I not fret?

64
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,920
Second Son is usually most gentle.

65
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,920
He at most just skips classes,

66
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,480
drink some wine and use up all the money,

67
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,200
or small matters like ridding a horse in the streets.

68
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,440
Since he's known that woman,

69
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,080
he's been completely bewitched by her

70
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,880
and raises two children too!

71
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,080
If we don't find this woman

72
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,400
and dismiss her soon,

73
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:16,720
I don't know how

74
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,120
she will ruin Second Brother later.

75
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,360
Where's Tingwei?

76
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,200
He has wide connections

77
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,120
and knows many loafing lordlings.

78
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,550
Maybe we can find out

79
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,000
Ye'er's information from them?

80
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,600
Don't mention him anymore.

81
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,720
That real son of mine

82
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,960
is the biggest oaf who is completely immature!

83
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,000
That day he saw that Second Son was beaten harshly.

84
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,120
he started to cry along several bouts.

85
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,800
I thought he would follow Darling Second

86
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,640
to do a bit learning.

87
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,320
But now he overrates himself,

88
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,040
and starts to do the poetry club.

89
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,440
My health won’t last.

90
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,880
If later on Darling Second

91
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,360
is not doing his duty again,

92
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,640
Tingwei will be the Marquis of Ningyuan.

93
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,360
Why can't he cultivate his temperament

94
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,520
and go to school now?

95
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,080
Stop the nonsense.

96
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,440
You're just frail.

97
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,040
That's not a major illness.

98
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,880
You're not allowed to speak so ominously.

99
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,600
Got it?

100
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,400
Stop there.

101
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,720
It’s you again!

102
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,600
It wasn't me.

103
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,120
Last time, I already told you.

104
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,480
When you come to work in our house,

105
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,720
no one is allowed to doll up herself.

106
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,520
Today, not only are you dressed like this,

107
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,840
but also you've loosened

108
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,920
your hair down,

109
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,160
putting up the seductress look.

110
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,760
I guess your brain was eaten by a dog,

111
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,840
and you didn't remember my words?

112
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,160
No, not so.

113
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,920
Duchess. Big Madam!

114
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,440
Forgive me.

115
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,725
forgive me this time.

116
00:06:26,725 --> 00:06:27,885
I will never dare again!

117
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,400
Last time I saw you like this,

118
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,480
I already spared you once.

119
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,920
This time, you repeat the offense knowingly.

120
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,360
That made the offense doubly guilty.

121
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,880
Go find someone

122
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,640
and sell

123
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,360
this shameless wench.

124
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,280
No,please don't!

125
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,440
Please forgive me!

126
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,600
Please forgive me.

127
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,850
I won't go.

128
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,160
It's useless even if you cry.

129
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,040
Please forgive me!

130
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,720
Even if you're crying like this,

131
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,120
The Young Lord in the study over there,

132
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,520
has he come out to take a look at you?

133
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,880
No, please!

134
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,160
Princess,

135
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,280
Princess!

136
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,880
Don't you think I don't know

137
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,280
what your schemes are.

138
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,400
You want to dress yourself as a seductress and

139
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,840
wish for the day that

140
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,960
the Young Lord can see you and take you in,

141
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,320
and you soar to the sky with one step

142
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,040
and become the mistress of the ducal house?

143
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,560
That’s a daydream!

144
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,280
You all listen carefully.

145
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,080
Send my instructions.

146
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,080
Especially these

147
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,040
newly-arrived girls,

148
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,200
be clever.

149
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,960
I grew up in the palace.

150
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,560
I've seen all sorts of tricks.

151
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,480
Don't play any tricks on me.

152
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,360
If I find out

153
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,480
someone has tried to lure

154
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,760
and ruin my son,

155
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,880
I will have you arrive vertically,

156
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,280
but leave here horizontally.

157
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,280
Yes, we shall mark your teaching.

158
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,080
Mother.

159
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,200
What are you looking at all night

160
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,080
that you don't even turn a page?

161
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,400
Is there something golden?

162
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,000
I saw a sentence on this page

163
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,025
and it reminded me

164
00:08:38,025 --> 00:08:39,160
of a query set out by the Academy Scholar.

165
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,810
I was puzzling over it.

166
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,480
A query?

167
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,440
What query?

168
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,625
Let me hear it.

169
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,400
Let Mother help you think it through.

170
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,400
No need.

171
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,120
Don't disregard your mother.

172
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,960
I have had a tutor

173
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,760
since I was young too.

174
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,800
My education is not lower than you and your father.

175
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,280
Which words

176
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,600
and what query?

177
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,640
Tell me.

178
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,920
Speaking of learning,

179
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,400
I have been

180
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,520
studying for quite some time at Sheng’s house now.

181
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,880
I've bothered them quite a bit.

182
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,680
Mother, how about this?

183
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,550
Tomorrow,

184
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,520
you come with me to pay a visit

185
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,680
to the Sheng Old Madam and

186
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,280
bring some light gifts as a token of our gratitude.

187
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,120
What do you think about that?

188
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,400
When you started to go to to the Sheng's to study,

189
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,720
your father already went there.

190
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,280
And we've sent many gifts there already.

191
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,120
By rights,

192
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,480
we are a ducal house.

193
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,840
Sheng House is a house of a fifth-rank official.

194
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,120
It’s humbling ourselves in making acquaintances like this.

195
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,200
And it would seem quite affected

196
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,600
if we frequent their house.

197
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,000
Others will feel like as if that

198
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,800
we are seeking something intentionally.

199
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,600
What could we seek there?

200
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,460
There's the saying that

201
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,640
you can't fault someone for being too cordial.

202
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,720
You're a child

203
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,800
who never cares for social visits before.

204
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,320
But today, how is it that you are interested?

205
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,400
Unless there's a story to it?

206
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,520
Mother, what do you mean?

207
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,720
Your son's grown.

208
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,360
As for social visits,

209
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,800
I should have more understanding.

210
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,200
It's nice for my son to have this thought.

211
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,400
The rest

212
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,080
your father and I will see to.

213
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,600
Once you place at the top and make a name,

214
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,960
it's not too late to socialize then.

215
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,560
Mother. Just make the trip, please?

216
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,560
I'm not feeling well lately

217
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,920
and my face is so haggard.

218
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,920
How can I meet anyone

219
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,400
with this face?

220
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,400
Mother, you're already

221
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,440
the most beautiful woman on earth.

222
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,160
If you are unsightly,

223
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,800
then no woman

224
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,840
is sightly.

225
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,880
You, child.

226
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,000
Why do you insist that I go to the Sheng house?

227
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,640
What do you plot?

228
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,920
What can I plot?

229
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,280
I just wanted Mother

230
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,120
to be more involved in my learning.

231
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,360
I care for you most tenderly.

232
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,240
Look.

233
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,560
This is all made specially for you.

234
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,280
During this exam period,

235
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,320
you should just focus on studying.

236
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,120
The rest, don't over-think it.

237
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,040
Princess, did you find

238
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,120
something suspicious?

239
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,280
He was holding a book,

240
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,400
but his eyes were looking elsewhere.

241
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,520
Reflecting on the literature and questions?

242
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,600
It seems more likely there's someone in his heart.

243
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,315
Princess,

244
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,720
should we deal with this inside?

245
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,520
There's many people here in the hallways.

246
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,080
That's exactly what I want.

247
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,160
Have them all watch this.

248
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,080
My respects, Princess.

249
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,600
For what have you requested my presence?

250
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,240
When Young Master was studying at the Sheng's study,

251
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,400
did he talk to the daughters

252
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,480
of the Sheng family?

253
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,400
Of course he did,

254
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,480
but he didn't say much either.

255
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,320
Master Scholar Zhuang keeps a tight schedule.

256
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,800
They were busy and didn't have much time to talk.

257
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,480
Think carefully again before you speak.

258
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,240
In the event

259
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,370
that I ever find out

260
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,960
that you are not telling the truth,

261
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,800
you know the consequences.

262
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,400
Everything is true, nothing has been falsified.

263
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,200
Big Madam, you may inquire as you wish.

264
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,520
Today, the three daughters of the Sheng family

265
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,040
didn't even show up.

266
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,213
I heard that it's because they sought a nanny

267
00:13:29,213 --> 00:13:30,320
to teach them etiquette.

268
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:30,813
Likely they won't even

269
00:13:30,813 --> 00:13:32,760
be able to meet anyone in the future.

270
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,640
Then

271
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,520
this Sheng's is cultured and steeped in propriety?

272
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,080
Yes. That's right.

273
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,200
The Young Master treats you well.

274
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,360
If you want to be good to him,

275
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,280
you should tell me the truth.

276
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,520
If you just go along with him, you will do him no good.

277
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,720
I understand.

278
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,360
I have always looked out

279
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,400
for his interest.

280
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,800
You don't need to be that scared.

281
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,760
Leave now.

282
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,240
Yes.

283
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,240
Utter nonsense.

284
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,600
He's up to something.

285
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,160
He's not telling the truth.

286
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,200
The Sheng family has three daughters.

287
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,600
I know what's

288
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,680
in their mind.

289
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,760
We can replace who's accompanying Young Master.

290
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,600
Don't do it. He's used to him.

291
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,574
Since he was little until now,

292
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:36,760
he has been with him and is very loyal.

293
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,320
Moreover, the examination is due shortly.

294
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,000
If nothing terrible happens,

295
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,880
it's better not to take any actions

296
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,840
and not create any scenes.

297
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,680
I'm afraid it will affect his future prospects.

298
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,760
Nanny. You are finally here.

299
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,880
I don't have to worry now that you are here.

300
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,520
I found this house for you.

301
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,480
Tianshui Alley.

302
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,200
The name is nice and the geomancy here is good too.

303
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,680
This house is very stylish

304
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,360
but I don’t need it.

305
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,200
Why not?

306
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,510
From now on

307
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,800
you are the owner.

308
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,720
They will listen to your instructions.

309
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,240
You must take good care of Nanny.

310
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:38,960
You must not be disrespectful.

311
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,560
Yes.

312
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,320
Come,Nanny,

313
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,120
you have been wearied by your travel.

314
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,840
Sit for a bit and rest.

315
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,280
No need for rest.

316
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,280
I'm not fit

317
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,000
to be a Mistress of a house.

318
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,680
I set out on a long journey

319
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,200
to share your worries and burdens.

320
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,040
Nanny, you had been serving my mother.

321
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,240
You have toiled for many years

322
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,800
in the Bai family.

323
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,920
You should enjoy a free and easy life now.

324
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,200
Even more so since I'm an adult now

325
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,520
and I have people to serve me.

326
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,480
I don't need to trouble you anymore.

327
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,800
Young Master,

328
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,560
don't underestimate this old woman.

329
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,880
I'm still sturdy and strong.

330
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,360
It's not a problem to work for another twenty years.

331
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,360
Furthermore, you need someone

332
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,440
who's considerate and caring.

333
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,640
Alright. Nanny, say no more.

334
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,800
I have decided.

335
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,040
Nanny. Frankly

336
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,960
there's a reason why I don't want you to live in

337
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,080
the Manor of the Marquis.

338
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,040
It's for your illegitimate child and that mistress?

339
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,960
Never mind. As long as she's pure and kind,

340
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,760
and is genuine

341
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,400
and sincere to you, it's good enough.

342
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,640
Of course.

343
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,520
Manniang is naturally pure, kind,

344
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,480
warm and caring.

345
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,120
It's just that

346
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,040
she doesn't have a good family background.

347
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,080
When she was destitute,

348
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,240
she was a minstrel for a short while.

349
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,440
She won't be able to enter the Manor of the Marquis.

350
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,560
What?

351
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,480
Young Master, you were so muddle-headed!

352
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,480
You...

353
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,440
Nanny, at the time,

354
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,840
when I saw her

355
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,560
being bullied

356
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,600
in the street,

357
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,630
I couldn't not help helping her.

358
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,520
But I didn't expect

359
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,280
she'd follow me

360
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,480
all the way to Bailudong.

361
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,480
Her elder brother died too.

362
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,920
Then

363
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,080
there were children.

364
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,880
I know you are very angry

365
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:57,360
but the mistake has already been committed.

366
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,880
These two kids are innocent.

367
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,400
Nanny,

368
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,520
since I lost my mother when I was young,

369
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,240
just help me.

370
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,440
Fine. You are the master and I'm the servant.

371
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,240
You want to keep a concubine

372
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,680
and you even have children.

373
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,520
How can this old woman not help you out?

374
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,480
Nanny, you dote on me the most.

375
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,520
By the way,

376
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,960
does your father know about this?

377
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,120
He knows.

378
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,560
Not only does he know,

379
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,440
But also he beat up Young Master

380
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,920
because of this!

381
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,000
Did he beat you severely?

382
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,960
Let me take a look.

383
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,160
It's not severe, Nanny.

384
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,200
I applied medicine this morning.

385
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,240
It's not visible anymore.

386
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,960
What do you mean?

387
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,840
It's bleeding.

388
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,120
The swelling is this huge.

389
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,800
No, I want to see

390
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,200
how bad the beating is.

391
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,725
Luckily I brought medicine for sprain,

392
00:18:57,725 --> 00:19:00,080
bruises and migraines.

393
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,520
I'm going to get it.

394
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,160
Nanny, no!

395
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,560
You wait here.

396
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,200
I have been waiting for many days.

397
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,320
You are finally here.

398
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,440
Greetings, Nanny Kong.

399
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,360
These are our

400
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,080
two mediocre daughters.

401
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,640
Being pampered since young

402
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,960
and inexperienced.

403
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,000
If they are not prepared for what's out there,

404
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,920
on account of their age, Nanny

405
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,160
please slowly guide them.

406
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,120
You can scold or beat them.

407
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,320
As their mother, I will not dote on them.

408
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,120
Big Madam, you are overly-modest.

409
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,000
The two young Misses

410
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
are girls from a respectable and educated family,

411
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,560
their bearing and poise are naturally exceptional.

412
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,600
I have only served

413
00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:08,059
in the palace for a few years

414
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,680
and experienced a bit more than others,

415
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,440
knowing something

416
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,200
about tea-brewing and incense appreciation.

417
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,480
If the Misses are willing to learn,

418
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,200
I shall teach all without reservation.

419
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,520
Quickly say your thanks to Nanny!

420
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,240
Thank you, Nanny.

421
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,720
Everyone, please be seated.

422
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:41,960
This..!

423
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,800
Madam has something going on.

424
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,400
Mistress Lin, you should go back.

425
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,400
I have something important to report to Big Madam.

426
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,350
I will leave when I'm done

427
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,360
No need.

428
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,480
Madam said that

429
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,400
this Nanny is here to teach proprieties

430
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,120
to the two Misses.

431
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,480
The Fourth Miss is always so proper and courteous,

432
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,520
gentle and virtuous.

433
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,040
Since she has never stepped out of line before,

434
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,720
she doesn't need further etiquette lessons.

435
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,720
It's not appropriate to say this.

436
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,040
They are all daughters of the Sheng family.

437
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,700
This is favoring one and slighting the other.

438
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,200
Exactly!

439
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,040
I'm an uneducated person.

440
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,600
I don't understand what this means.

441
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,120
I'm only here to relay the main Mistress' message.

442
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,680
If you still refuse to leave

443
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,480
Someone.

444
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,160
You...

445
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,520
You,you!

446
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,000
Let's see if this yard belongs to “Sheng”

447
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,840
or "Lin" !

448
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,640
Filthy witch.

449
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,600
Though she calls herself the Madam

450
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,880
but she is not acting like one!

451
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,240
So afraid that my Mo'er

452
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,760
will steal her daughter's prestige!

453
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,040
Mistress, don't be angry.

454
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,320
We will have other solutions.

455
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,240
My poor Mo'er,

456
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,400
she was born from me.

457
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,760
If I was the Madam of the house，

458
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,680
I wouldn't have to worry

459
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,780
about her future like this.

460
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,460
Exactly!

461
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,320
I will get her into Nanny Kong's class

462
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,320
no matter what!

463
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,000
We will definitely find a way.

464
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,360
What evil sins.

465
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,240
Although it's wrong

466
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,480
to have a mistress who's a singer,

467
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,840
he shouldn't have been so ruthless as to do this either.

468
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,240
New wounds pile on old scars.

469
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,240
No matter what, you are still his flesh and blood.

470
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,160
If something goes wrong,

471
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,480
what is he to do?

472
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,040
I'm fine, Nanny.

473
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,160
These wounds will be okay after a few days.

474
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,280
Since you were young until now,

475
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,800
you have been beaten many times.

476
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,240
You have been always beaten into this state.

477
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,080
Not, not every time.

478
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,360
Seriously.

479
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,120
It's too cruel. Too cruel!

480
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,840
It's also my fault

481
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,240
for being such a disappointment.

482
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,080
Wait.

483
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,680
Where did you get this scar from?

484
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,080
I don't remember you

485
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,000
had this before.

486
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,720
This is not a scar

487
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,320
you can get from beatings.

488
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,680
Young Master, stop hiding this from me.

489
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,480
Tell me.

490
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,160
How did you get this?

491
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,800
Three years ago,

492
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,160
a brother from the Fifth Branch House

493
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,400
took an interest in a maid.

494
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,350
The maid refused his advances,

495
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,320
so he forced himself upon her.

496
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,680
The maid was fiercely virtuous,

497
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,480
in the end she committed suicide.

498
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,680
They put the blame on me.

499
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,800
But the dead cannot bear witness.

500
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,240
The manor of a Marquis

501
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,560
is no better than a jail.

502
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,960
It's hell. It's almost purgatory!

503
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,720
They were purposefully wanting you to die,

504
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,080
scheming for your wealth and assets.

505
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,280
Nanny, what do you mean by "wanting me to die"

506
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,280
and "scheming for my wealth"?

507
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,360
You sound like you're telling stories.

508
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,825
Young Master, you are after all the child

509
00:23:49,825 --> 00:23:51,320
of a legal wife in the Manor of the Marquis.

510
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,600
Moreover, that Mistress Qin,

511
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,440
she treats you very well.

512
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,680
Hence, there are some things

513
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,280
I meant to keep to myself

514
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,920
and take them to my coffin to see First Miss.

515
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,840
If you don't wish to hear it, Young Master.

516
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,880
I will just not say it.

517
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,160
I will hear it.

518
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,600
You must find it strange

519
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,050
how was it that your mother,

520
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,640
who was the daughter of salt merchant,

521
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,560
was able to marry into a Marquis Manor,

522
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,440
and become the main wife, the legitimate Madam.

523
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,440
To be the legitimate wife,

524
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,000
it matters that the two houses match each other in status.

525
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,040
But for a second marriage,

526
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,880
it's not so strict, right?

527
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,280
The Gu House earned their nobility through meritorious service.

528
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,800
They earned their death-pardoning medallion.

529
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,275
If it hadn't been due to a great calamity

530
00:25:01,275 --> 00:25:01,800
that was upon them,

531
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,840
they wouldn't have married with a merchant family.

532
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,560
What calamity?

533
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,600
The Old Master,

534
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,440
he built a business empire all on his own.

535
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,840
He only had a sole child, your mother, the First Miss.

536
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,600
He knew the Bai's residing in the southern village

537
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,425
would banish

538
00:25:23,425 --> 00:25:25,440
and kill even orphans and widows.

539
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,360
They could not be relied upon.

540
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,240
So he wanted to seek

541
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,680
a good marriage for the young Miss.

542
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,800
It didn't matter

543
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,160
if it was a humble family or wealthy one.

544
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,120
What mattered was whether they would be good to the Miss.

545
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,280
He was willing to give a lavish dowry

546
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,360
to accompany her in marriage.

547
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,160
At that time,

548
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,720
suddenly someone from the capital paid a visit.

549
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,760
The visitor said a merit-earned noble house

550
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,920
in Dongjing was seeking a marriage.

551
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,400
They had found out that our Miss

552
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,640
was virtuous and gentle.

553
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,480
The matchmaker made it sound like a match in heaven.

554
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,560
But the Old Master had already found out

555
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,360
the one that came to seek marriage

556
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,050
was asking it for

557
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,040
the Fourth and Fifth sons of the Marquis.

558
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,480
Go slowly.

559
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,000
Go slowly now, Fourth Master.

560
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,520
Come often.

561
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,560
For you.

562
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,160
Take it.

563
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,720
One was whoring frequently,

564
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,040
and the other was haughty and rude.

565
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,480
Only the eldest son, Gu Yankai.

566
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,360
was a prudent gentleman.

567
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,000
But when he asked,

568
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,240
it was found out that the Eldest Master

569
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:29,950
had already married a Miss

570
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:30,880
from the Qin family from Dongchang.

571
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,600
So she would only be a concubine if she married him.

572
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,500
The Miss was a sole daughter

573
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,520
and she had lost her mother in childhood.

574
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,920
The Old Master treasured her,

575
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,520
so he couldn't bear for her to suffer this indignity.

576
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,480
So we thought the matter

577
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,720
was done.

578
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,880
But half a year later,

579
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,080
the Old Marquis and the Madam came to the house.

580
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,450
They said that the legal wife

581
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:54,400
of the eldest legitimate son of the Marquis Manor

582
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,480
had died from illness.

583
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,040
They were seeking a remarriage for him

584
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,000
and wanted to marry the Miss of our house.

585
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,800
Perfect match for that son.

586
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,120
How could it be so coincidental?

587
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,320
Yes. How could it be so coincidental?

588
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,200
The Gu House said the Madam Qin

589
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,080
had always been sickly.

590
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,840
They had made the betrothal when they were children,

591
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,680
so the marriage was fulfilled only to keep a promise.

592
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,480
So the misfortune

593
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,920
was actually expected.

594
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,760
Since the Marquis and Madam came to visit personally,

595
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,800
and they were wiling to welcome the Miss

596
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,760
with full fanfare as the legitimate wife,

597
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,520
it was the most

598
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,240
desirable match.

599
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,040
Since Father selected him,

600
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,160
I'm sure it must be good.

601
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,200
I will listen to Father's arrangement.

602
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,120
Great.

603
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,920
A year of mourning was completed

604
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,280
and the Marquis house sent the betrothal gifts.

605
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,880
The Old Master kept his promise.

606
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,475
The Miss brought with her

607
00:27:53,475 --> 00:27:54,840
three to five boats of dowry items

608
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,160
and married afar to the Marquis house in Dongjing.

609
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,840
Miss, you are both good-looking and intelligent.

610
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,200
You will live

611
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,480
such a luxurious and happy life

612
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,680
at the Marquis house.

613
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,275
But who knew that once she entered the house,

614
00:28:15,275 --> 00:28:16,880
bowed for the marriage ceremony,

615
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,360
and been listed in the genealogy,

616
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,640
it was only then she discovered things were not good.

617
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,920
Gu Yankai, that oaf!

618
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,760
Because he was born in a Marquis Manor,

619
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,120
we thought he was gentle and upright.

620
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,240
But that oaf!

621
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,640
He delayed it for over three months.

622
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,040
Only after a great scolding

623
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,160
by the elder Marquis and Madam

624
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,960
did he finally consummate the marriage with my Miss.

625
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,400
Making my Miss

626
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,520
the laughing-stock of the entire manor.

627
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,080
After the elder Marquis and Madam passed away,

628
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,160
he inherited the Marquis title

629
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,840
and he only became more haughty.

630
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,440
He slighted my Miss.

631
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,320
And the days at the Marquis Manor

632
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,600
just became harder and harder by the day.

633
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,680
Marquis,

634
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,840
what did I do wrong exactly?

635
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,280
Why do you treat me this way?

636
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,120
Not long after that,

637
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,520
you were born, Young Master.

638
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,640
The Miss finally had someone to put her feelings in.

639
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,760
But precisely because she had you,

640
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,800
her relationship with him

641
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,000
became worse.

642
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,280
I thought

643
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,120
It could wear on like this.

644
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,120
Who doesn't survive their days like that?

645
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,560
But who knew.

646
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,120
That day, it was so coincidental.

647
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,000
We unexpectedly went to

648
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,840
stroll in the garden.

649
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,800
Tingyu, you must remember.

650
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,320
Your mother was forced to death by someone.

651
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:48,240
You must never

652
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,680
forgive your enemy.

653
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,560
Who killed her?

654
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:55,680
That Bai Madam

655
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,240
in the house now.

656
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,200
I don't understand.

657
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,560
Mother Bai is good to me.

658
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,520
Foolish child. That's all fake.

659
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,240
That Bai house knew the Emperor

660
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,240
was leading an investigation on Gu’s deficit.

661
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,880
So they wanted to make themselves lofty

662
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,000
with the money they had.

663
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,000
They forced their daughter

664
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,200
to marry into the Marquis Manor,

665
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,960
saying they can help your grandfather

666
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,160
with the money he needed,

667
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,880
and forced your father to divorce your mother.

668
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:22,480
Your father wouldn't.

669
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,720
But your mother,

670
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,480
she was driven to death by them.

671
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,400
leaving you and your father

672
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,040
all alone and pitiful in the world.

673
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,080
Nonsense.

674
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,680
That Bai...

675
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,560
Preposterous!

676
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,520
Who are you?

677
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,440
How dare you

678
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,080
sow discord using my mistress.

679
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:37,640
You!

680
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,080
Nanny Chang!

681
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,200
Madam,

682
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,280
that bunch of wenches are making up gossip.

683
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,200
Miss, you needn't take it seriously.

684
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,840
Later we will go ask the Marquis

685
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,440
who that wench is!

686
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,360
Father and Mother-in-law came to our house

687
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,440
and asked personally.

688
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:57,480
They said the Marquis' wife was already dead

689
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,880
and they sought a remarriage for him.

690
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,600
That's how he married me as a second wife,

691
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,200
right?

692
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,120
Yes.

693
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,440
That's what they said to the Old Master.

694
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:04,560
I heard it clearly

695
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,600
with the Old Master!

696
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,600
But why does she say it

697
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,440
like my father forced the Qin wife to die?

698
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,160
Who's telling the truth?

699
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,880
Big Madam! Big Madam!

700
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,040
What are you doing?

701
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,000
Was it only for my dowry

702
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,960
that you married me?

703
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,120
Miss, go and rest first.

704
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,120
Watch out for your belly.

705
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:39,720
The five hundred thousand taels of dowry

706
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,440
I brought filled your family's deficit.

707
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,280
The deficit wasn't what I thought it was

708
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,320
just your family run out of silver.

709
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,320
It was actually you nobles

710
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,800
borrowing from the Imperial court

711
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,840
and never paying it back!

712
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,280
His Majesty asked you

713
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,620
to repay the debt,

714
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,000
and he's already put two nobles in jail,

715
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,830
right?

716
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,160
Who told you?

717
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,280
Tell me if it's true!

718
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,240
You don't want to tell me about deficit with the court.

719
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,360
Then tell me,

720
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,000
how did the Qin wife die?

721
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,600
Why are you asking that

722
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,960
out of nowhere?

723
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,080
Didn't I

724
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,240
tell you already?

725
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,640
She died from an illness.

726
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,880
Then did she die from an illness

727
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,200
before you sought marriage at my home,

728
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,800
or it was after that that she died?

729
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,120
In order to fill this deficit you owed,

730
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,000
your family needed

731
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,080
three to five hundred thousand taels.

732
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,480
The Qin wife was weak and sickly,

733
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,200
so you divorced her to marry me.

734
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,120
She died from a broken heart.

735
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,360
Now

736
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,260
you have got your silver

737
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,160
and you've escaped the calamity,

738
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,440
so you have started to treat me

739
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,520
and my son as problems,

740
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,440
saying how great

741
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,200
the former Qin wife was at every whim,

742
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,560
and laughing at

743
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,640
my low status behind my back,

744
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,520
even you don't try to show care for me.

745
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,120
I had thought you were from a military background,

746
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,480
so you don't know how to dote on people.

747
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,240
And I thought Qin wife was so gentle

748
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,520
and I couldn't compare with her!

749
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,080
But in reality,

750
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,600
the entire family of yours regard me as

751
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,520
the true perpetrator of your Qin wife's death!

752
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,480
This is all your own wild guess.

753
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,600
How does it even exist?

754
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:32,000
I'm making a wild guess?

755
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,480
During all these years I've been married to you,

756
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:34,800
when you're with me,

757
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,640
you're either sighing

758
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,080
or piqued.

759
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,000
The two sons

760
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,800
are both your real sons.

761
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,200
But how many times did you hold Ye'er in total?

762
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,600
Do you know

763
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,320
how many teeth he has and how tall he is now?

764
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,000
Your hand has long fingers and short fingers.

765
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,720
Yu'er's mother is gone

766
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,800
and he's sickly.

767
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,080
Is it wrong

768
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,000
that I favor him?

769
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,280
He doesn't have his birth mother

770
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,840
but he still has me as his step-mother!

771
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,800
Was I ever

772
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,880
an evil mother to him?

773
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,360
Even if Yu'er comes before you,

774
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,700
he couldn't tell you any fault in me.

775
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,000
But you!

776
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,280
In and out of the house.

777
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,320
One here, and one there.

778
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,640
You keep stuffing defaming words about me

779
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,680
into Yu'er's ears.

780
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,000
Today in the garden,

781
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:16,840
a maidservant

782
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,000
told Yu'er in public

783
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,600
that he shouldn't forget he has the grudge with me

784
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,040
about me killing his mother!

785
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,200
And you keep inviting

786
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,000
Qin family guests,

787
00:35:24,175 --> 00:35:24,960
and who knows what that bunch say

788
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,520
about me behind my back!

789
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,560
Shut up!

790
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,480
The Qins are like family to us.

791
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,600
Don't slander them.

792
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,120
You go and ask

793
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:37,080
your entire family,

794
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:37,760
what have you all taught

795
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,920
Yu'er all day?

796
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,120
Then you will know

797
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,000
if I am slandering.

798
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,760
What you are talking is really nonsense.

799
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,880
Stop making a scene!

800
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,320
I'm making a scene?

801
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,120
Marquis.

802
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,920
You've never seen a real scene then.

803
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,560
Today you can write me

804
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,280
a divorce paper.

805
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,520
I will take Ye'er

806
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,440
and we'll return to our old hometown of Yangzhou,

807
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,720
clean and tidy.

808
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,440
Enough!

809
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,120
You.

810
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:12,880
Since you have been

811
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,760
pregnant for eight months now,

812
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,680
you can't go anywhere!

813
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,280
Madam,

814
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,600
your anger is confusing you.

815
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,320
These are all old matters.

816
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,240
Let's rethink this.

817
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,640
You're with child now.

818
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,000
They belittle us

819
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,000
as merchant households,

820
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,600
so just give me a divorce paper

821
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,480
so I can go.

822
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,880
The dowry,

823
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,400
I'll regard it as having been lost to your family.

824
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,880
I won't even ask for one coin back.

825
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,720
Clean and tidy.

826
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,080
Free and clear, I'm going.

827
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,840
Stop making this scene!

828
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,560
The dowry was agreed

829
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,960
upon by your father.

830
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,440
You should just focus on

831
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,120
delivering the child safely and we’ll discuss this later.

832
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,120
Stop being played by the wicked-minded.

833
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,360
Let me go.

834
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,000
Madam.

835
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,880
Let go of me!

836
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:57,960
You can't go!

837
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,520
Madam. Madam?

838
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,720
What's wrong?

839
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,280
Get the physician.

840
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,080
She's in labor!

841
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,040
Madam!

842
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,680
Attendants!

843
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,680
Madam!

844
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,050
Get the physician.

845
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:10,200
Find the midwife.

846
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,120
Madam is in labor!

847
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,520
Madam!

848
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,640
I was fooled so wretchedly by you all.

849
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,520
Madam

850
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,360
A year after your mother passed away,

851
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,400
the Marquis hurriedly married

852
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,800
the younger sister of the Qin first wife.

853
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,360
Don't say anymore.

854
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,080
Could it be a misunderstanding?

855
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,350
Could you have heard wrong

856
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:44,960
or remembered wrong?

857
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,120
I told you everything I saw

858
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,160
with my own eyes.

859
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:53,120
Not one bit of it is wrong.

860
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,600
These years, these matters,

861
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,800
they rolled over

862
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,160
again and again in my mind.

863
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,480
I remember them very clearly.

864
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,920
Rest up, Nanny.

865
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,300
Looking at the beauty under the candlelight is just like

866
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,120
looking at the flower under the moonlight.

867
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,560
What a sight it is.

868
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,040
I'm old now.

869
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,000
Not old.

870
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,800
Even if a few more decades go by,

871
00:39:04,872 --> 00:39:06,000
to me

872
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,920
you're still a beauty.

873
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,640
Do you really mean it?

874
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,720
If you meet a younger and more beautiful one,

875
00:39:12,825 --> 00:39:14,040
won't you be enticed?

876
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,200
Beauties are plenty.

877
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,480
But a beauty with so much talent

878
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,240
and understanding is a rarity.

879
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,560
Shuang'er, in my heart,

880
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,040
you're always the best.

881
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,160
I remember that day.

882
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,000
I was doing needlework with the Old Madam.

883
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,680
You lifted up the curtain and came in,

884
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,840
bringing with you a breeze of jasmine scent.

885
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,600
I will never forget

886
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,920
that image of you then.

887
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,320
This lifetime, following you,

888
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,200
I have no complaint.

889
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:05,280
Shuang'er, I shall never let you regret.

890
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,800
I shall never regret.

891
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,080
Feng'er and Mo'er are both so obedient,

892
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,600
and I often think at night

893
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,120
that this all is a good life

894
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,520
you've given me.

895
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:28,040
Just that lately Mo'er often cries

896
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,200
and I'm afraid she will ruin her health by crying.

897
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,880
What's wrong with her suddenly?

898
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,360
It's all due to that she lost your face

899
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,560
before the Countess a few days ago.

900
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,640
That's not her fault,

901
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,120
and I've already looked into it to clear her.

902
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,200
It was Rulan and Minglan,

903
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,880
those two girls who are troublesome.

904
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,440
But the court Nanny from the palace is here.

905
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,080
And she's teaching rules to Rulan and Minglan,

906
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,520
but she won't let Mo'er attend.

907
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,160
Those two are senseless

908
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,040
and they need to be taught,

909
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,120
but Molan is most sensible.

910
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,320
She needn't go.

911
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,240
She can just continue with the academy lessons.

912
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,760
But Molan

913
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,560
still did go to the front hall.

914
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,120
Her temperament is like mine.

915
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,400
Just too soft.

916
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,520
She should actually listen to

917
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,320
the palace Nanny's teaching.

918
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,600
But since you dote on me,

919
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,160
Big Madam chased me out

920
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,600
and scolded me,

921
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,440
saying I'm always seducing you.

922
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,400
She scolded you again?

923
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,360
That's nothing to worry about.

924
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:40,080
Just my Mo'er is pitiful.

925
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,480
Pity that she's noble.

926
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,880
But since she just had to be born from me.

927
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:49,560
she doesn't even get to listen to

928
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,640
lessons about lady rules.

929
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,040
I just loathe that

930
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,640
we met too late.

931
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,480
You were already with a wife

932
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,920
and I couldn't bear to leave you.

933
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,520
So I could only become your concubine,

934
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,800
and I've compromised my own children.

935
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,840
If my Mo'er were born from Big Madam's belly,

936
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,920
how great would it be?

937
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,200
Alright.

938
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,120
No crying.

939
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,280
Look at you.

940
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,200
That's punishment.

941
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,600
It's not some great honor.

942
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,120
Don't be sad.

943
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,680
Alright.

944
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:45,680
Darling,

945
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,800
I'm a lowly servant by origin.

946
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,720
I fear I will ruin

947
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,960
Mo'er's match.

948
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:54,080
Mo'er is outstanding

949
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:54,920
but that's still not enough.

950
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,520
It's all up to Big Madam.

951
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,400
Hong. Tell me.

952
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,920
Does Big Madam hate you

953
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,040
because I'm pampered,

954
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,520
and that's why

955
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,760
she won't let Mo'er go listen to the lessons?

956
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,240
She can’t make decisions for me yet!

957
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:15,840
It's true.

958
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,520
In this house,

959
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,360
you are still the Master.
