00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,918
Episode 26

3
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,115
Seeing Mother returning unharmed today,

4
00:01:07,605 --> 00:01:09,645
I'm finally at ease.

5
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,880
On our way there, it was indeed a bit stormy.

6
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,250
But on our way back,

7
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,970
it was really good.

8
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,600
We didn't even see a fly.

9
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,550
We have caused you all to worry.

10
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,750
We still have one joyous piece of news

11
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,300
to tell you.

12
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,600
Hualan has given birth!

13
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,765
It was a chubby boy!

14
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,120
Look.

15
00:01:35,331 --> 00:01:37,583
This is great.

16
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:38,700
Great.

17
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,770
It's all thanks to Mother

18
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,290
asking Old Madam He to examine her.

19
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,210
I feel

20
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,427
so grateful.

21
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,560
Good. Good.

22
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,949
You all are

23
00:01:52,949 --> 00:01:54,629
also old.

24
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,267
We all just want our children

25
00:01:56,267 --> 00:01:57,080
to be living a good life.

26
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,380
As long as they are good, our clan will be good.

27
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,890
Yes, what Mother said is right.

28
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,680
Congratulations, Father and Mother.

29
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,400
You finally have a grandchild.

30
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,390
Good child.

31
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,350
Looks like it was quite comfortable in our hometown.

32
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,510
Ming'er's complexion is better now.

33
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,020
In the countryside, she only ate and slept.

34
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,220
She has indeed gotten fatter.

35
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,530
Ming'er, I remember that

36
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,730
you've placed your

37
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,370
Little Mother's memorial tablet here.

38
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,750
Since we're here,

39
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,790
go visit her and light some incense.

40
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,230
Yes.

41
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:36,914
Go ahead.

42
00:02:36,914 --> 00:02:38,130
Father and Mother, just sit here then.

43
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,488
I'll take my leave.

44
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,589
You little naughty child,

45
00:02:57,812 --> 00:02:59,820
why are you randomly bumping into people?

46
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,867
It's fine.

47
00:03:00,867 --> 00:03:01,840
It's fine. Let him go.

48
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,480
Sorry.

49
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,160
I once made a promise

50
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,640
in front of my Little Mother

51
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,876
that I would read the

52
00:03:16,876 --> 00:03:18,549
Lingbao Scripture on being reborn

53
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:19,829
and being saved from sufferings seven times.

54
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,240
You all go back to your work.

55
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,330
Yes.

56
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,110
I will be coming to the capital soon

57
00:03:48,432 --> 00:03:49,872
to discuss something important with you.

58
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,900
We can indeed meet in that place.

59
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:54,434
We have to talk face to face urgently.

60
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,110
Auntie is coming.

61
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,640
After staying outside for several days,

62
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:28,590
you've grown thinner.

63
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,578
I'm fine.

64
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,700
It's just that I didn't find Chang'er,

65
00:04:34,992 --> 00:04:37,192
and Rong'er just suffered with me.

66
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:41,490
Yes, Rong'er has also grown thinner.

67
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,120
Nanny.

68
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,173
One person told me

69
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,870
that Rong'er is of noble bloodline.

70
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,250
Following me wandering around

71
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,292
and not getting educated properly

72
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,088
will hinder her future life.

73
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,570
After thinking about it,

74
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,040
I've decided to leave Rong'er

75
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,240
to be raised by you here

76
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,400
in the capital.

77
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,480
Don't worry.

78
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,800
I dare not speak about other things much,

79
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,474
but I'm good at raising children.

80
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,630
I surely will adequately take care of her.

81
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,500
Rong'er is also of the right age for school.

82
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,705
Studying is good.

83
00:05:28,972 --> 00:05:30,159
It helps people discern right

84
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:31,252
from wrong, good from bad.

85
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,121
In the future, she won't be like me,

86
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:35,890
I got easily fooled by others.

87
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,300
She also won't be like her mother,

88
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,386
harboring evil intentions.

89
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,663
Miss Rong'er is your bloodline.

90
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,620
Of course, she'll be great.

91
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,622
It's just that regarding her schooling

92
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:53,790
I don't know anything about it.

93
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,990
Don't worry.

94
00:05:55,198 --> 00:05:56,058
Tomorrow,

95
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,954
I'll go look for Second Brother Sheng.

96
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,990
A school for girls?

97
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,110
I know a little.

98
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,280
I'll just ask Zhaoyun when I go back home.

99
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,700
Ladies from the House of Hai

100
00:06:13,842 --> 00:06:15,583
have private schooling since they were little.

101
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,439
I can send Rong'er there to listen.

102
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,240
Brother Changbai.

103
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,353
I'll hand my daughter's studying

104
00:06:37,353 --> 00:06:39,425
to your main wife then.

105
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,190
This afternoon,

106
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,367
I'll send someone to deliver three pieces

107
00:06:43,367 --> 00:06:44,040
of jewelry to your house

108
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,070
as my wedding gifts.

109
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,309
Okay. Once Zhaoyun and I have discussed

110
00:06:47,309 --> 00:06:47,992
and made a decision,

111
00:06:48,395 --> 00:06:49,235
I'll inform you.

112
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,860
I'll get going now.

113
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,885
I have to handle a lot of matters today.

114
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,920
I got transferred from Hanlin Academy

115
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,040
to the Ministry of Rites.

116
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,880
I'm unable to make time.

117
00:07:01,327 --> 00:07:02,607
Wait.

118
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,651
Rong'er! Come over here!

119
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,430
Come.

120
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:11,530
Rong'er,

121
00:07:13,092 --> 00:07:14,292
your Uncle Changbai

122
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,900
found you a private school.

123
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,050
From now on,

124
00:07:17,356 --> 00:07:19,400
you can study with

125
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,400
brothers and sisters from other families.

126
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,555
Quickly thank your uncle.

127
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,150
Thank you, Uncle.

128
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,060
I offer you my thanks.

129
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,580
Good child.

130
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,090
You can just thank me once you start schooling.

131
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,230
Father,

132
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,220
with an uncle like this,

133
00:07:36,483 --> 00:07:37,723
do I still call those people

134
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:39,560
in the manor uncles too?

135
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,838
Those uncles from the House of Gu

136
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:43,610
are just for show.

137
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,270
Only this uncle from the House of Sheng

138
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,590
is a real uncle.

139
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,641
When will you change your bad habit

140
00:07:50,641 --> 00:07:51,780
of speaking rubbish?

141
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,543
When your Third Little Brother sees me,

142
00:07:54,543 --> 00:07:56,567
he secretly asks about your whereabouts.

143
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,390
They probably are afraid that I'm still not dead.

144
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,800
Your little brother

145
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,160
really misses you.

146
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,930
Moreover, your name is still

147
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:07,850
in your genealogy book.

148
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,730
If this gets out,

149
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,030
you would look like the one at fault.

150
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:12,990
What's there to be afraid of?

151
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,620
Anyway,

152
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,580
I don't plan to go back there.

153
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,130
Once you have time,

154
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,830
let's have some drinks.

155
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,140
Okay.

156
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:21,510
Father,

157
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,002
I remember!

158
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,802
That Little Aunt we escorted back

159
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,306
is Uncle's Little Sister.

160
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,762
That day, I happened to bump into

161
00:08:33,762 --> 00:08:35,420
your little sister in Youyang.

162
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,730
Anyway, I was going back to the capital too,

163
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,320
so I protected and escorted her back.

164
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,560
You mustn't tell her this.

165
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,690
It will look like I've done her a favor.

166
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,800
You

167
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,021
You don't want to tell people the good deeds

168
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:48,530
you've done for them.

169
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,930
But when people falsely accuse you, you admit it.

170
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,010
You what is to happening to your life?

171
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,280
What's happening ahead?

172
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,745
The carriage of the House of Sheng is in front fetching

173
00:09:06,745 --> 00:09:08,049
the women in their house and has blocked our way.

174
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,350
I fear that we won't be able to pass for a while.

175
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,141
Should we wait or?

176
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14,951
House of Sheng?

177
00:09:14,951 --> 00:09:16,452
Their Old Madam is back in the capital?

178
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,505
Yes,

179
00:09:17,505 --> 00:09:18,410
Master Sheng and Madam Sheng

180
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,370
personally came to fetch her.

181
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,700
So filial.

182
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,730
This is fate.

183
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,350
Quickly assist me down.

184
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:27,380
Since the Old Madam hasn't left yet,

185
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,950
I'll go pay my respects,

186
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,390
and at the same time,

187
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,510
look at the Sixth Miss by her side.

188
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,023
Hurry up.

189
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,020
Mother, I'll just go look

190
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,220
if the carriages have been prepared.

191
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,680
Big Madam Wang! Old Madam!

192
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,520
Madam Wu!

193
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,870
While outside, I 'd heard that

194
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,440
your carriages are here.

195
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,351
I'm thinking

196
00:09:57,351 --> 00:09:58,735
that we're really fated.

197
00:09:58,735 --> 00:10:00,480
Look at how we bumped into each other here.

198
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,898
Old Madam, have you been doing well?

199
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,650
With such cold weather,

200
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:05,740
you still come here into the outskirts.

201
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,358
Anyone would get touched by your sincerity.

202
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,510
It's all for the marriage of my sixth child.

203
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,750
All his brother and sisters ahead of him

204
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,910
are now married.

205
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,500
Only he is not yet successful or settled until now.

206
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,870
I must pray more

207
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,190
to obtain a gratifying

208
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,639
and satisfactory daughter-in-law.

209
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,998
I fear that you might be getting quite cross-eyed!

210
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,490
Marriage is

211
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,216
set by the heavens.

212
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,540
Isn't it? Children are our debts.

213
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,177
Big Madam, Old Madam, have you heard the news?

214
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,120
The Young Lord of the House of Duke Qi of the State

215
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,460
and Her Highness the Princess

216
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,210
have been fighting for several months already.

217
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,010
Recently, you can't even see a smile

218
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,782
on the Princess' face.

219
00:10:53,782 --> 00:10:54,989
So scary.

220
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,500
These past few days,

221
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,100
Young Lord hasn't come out of the house either.

222
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,530
He's acting up inside their home.

223
00:11:00,238 --> 00:11:01,878
He won't even eat now.

224
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,180
Sanxing preserves us!

225
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,430
How come Young Lord is this bold? Yes.

226
00:11:07,442 --> 00:11:09,577
Why is he unhappy?

227
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,044
The Young Lord is the only child of the Princess.

228
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,720
Why is

229
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,200
he contradicting her?

230
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,761
How would I know?

231
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,100
But I heard that

232
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,628
Her Highness the Princess this time

233
00:11:23,628 --> 00:11:24,960
is really very mad.

234
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,430
When she was unable to convince him,

235
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:30,824
she beat one maid serving the Young Lord to death,

236
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,030
saying that she seduced the Young Lord!

237
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,050
That's a fragile human life.

238
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,000
This

239
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,680
This is really a sin, a sin!

240
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,150
It sounds quite scary.

241
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,590
Big Madam,

242
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,898
just accompany the Countess to chat a little.

243
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,810
I'm already old and can't endure too much exhaustion.

244
00:11:48,106 --> 00:11:49,578
I'll take my leave.

245
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,730
I'm behaving improperly.

246
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,741
After seeing Big Madam and Sixth Miss,

247
00:11:54,741 --> 00:11:56,200
I've forgotten everything.

248
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,215
Even holding you all here

249
00:11:57,215 --> 00:11:58,430
and chatting for a long time.

250
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,090
Old Madam, take care.

251
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,140
I'll visit you again in a few days.

252
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,060
Okay. Okay. I'll clean up the house

253
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,481
to wait for your arrival then.

254
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:06,900
Okay. Okay.

255
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,540
Old Madam,good-bye!

256
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,388
I've said everything that should be said.

257
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,570
If you're smart,

258
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:21,900
you should know

259
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,860
that House of Duke Qi of the State

260
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,060
is a mountain of fiery blades.

261
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,680
My Count

262
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,200
of Yongchang's Manor

263
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,240
is easier to get into.

264
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,060
What's wrong, Miss?

265
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,285
Did anything major

266
00:12:49,285 --> 00:12:50,914
happen here at home?

267
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,118
Nothing, Sixth Miss.

268
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,692
Now Big Madam is the chief steward

269
00:12:57,692 --> 00:12:59,209
and Madam Hai helps her out.

270
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,270
Mistress Lin indeed caused some ruckus,

271
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:04,300
but when it didn't work, she stopped.

272
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,020
Fourth Miss and Fifth Miss are still like before,

273
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,964
ignoring each other.

274
00:13:06,964 --> 00:13:08,044
But when they get in conflict,

275
00:13:08,044 --> 00:13:08,472
they're like black chickens

276
00:13:08,472 --> 00:13:10,710
I heard that

277
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,670
I heard

278
00:13:13,178 --> 00:13:14,888
that a female servant got caned to death

279
00:13:14,888 --> 00:13:16,498
in the House of Duke Qi of the State.

280
00:13:16,498 --> 00:13:17,965
Is that true?

281
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,783
There was indeed such an incident, Sixth Miss.

282
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:29,500
I heard that she was a newly-bought servant

283
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,500
called "Tanyun",

284
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,848
who served in the courtyard of Young Lord.

285
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,212
Then..why?

286
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,122
I heard that she looked a bit like you.

287
00:13:46,504 --> 00:13:48,340
During the selection,

288
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,980
Young Lord immediately chose her

289
00:13:50,285 --> 00:13:51,685
and had her serve him in his study.

290
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,910
Afterwards, Young Lord refused to eat

291
00:13:55,253 --> 00:13:56,158
and only this female servant

292
00:13:56,158 --> 00:13:56,933
was able to urge him to.

293
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,040
But I don't know why it angered the Princess,

294
00:14:02,332 --> 00:14:02,972
and she got...

295
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,490
Miss.

296
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,858
Those words by the Countess today

297
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,140
were partly because she likes you.

298
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,290
Calculating it,

299
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,097
the legitimate child of a count

300
00:15:09,788 --> 00:15:11,809
is also quite a high connection to make.

301
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,615
It is much higher than

302
00:15:14,615 --> 00:15:16,240
the marriage of your Sister Hualan.

303
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,570
In the second place,

304
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,800
other than your muddled Main Mother

305
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,360
not understanding it,

306
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,190
the two of us with minds

307
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:30,434
as clear as a mirror

308
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,220
surely understood who she's saying it to.

309
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,600
Yes, I understood.

310
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,820
What is your opinion then?

311
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,435
Until now,

312
00:15:44,703 --> 00:15:46,343
were you still bearing hopes?

313
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,259
No matter how good Qi Heng is,

314
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,305
you shouldn't enter that

315
00:15:52,305 --> 00:15:53,129
House of Duke Qi of the State.

316
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,980
You just saw what happened to your Sister Shulan.

317
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,160
If in the future you decide to turn back,

318
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,670
your parents will never

319
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,054
offend the Duke and Princess just for you.

320
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,760
Do you want me,

321
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,228
with these old bones of mine,

322
00:16:07,489 --> 00:16:08,929
to seek justice for you?

323
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,810
Ming'er,

324
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,626
you are smart.

325
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,850
You must know that there are some things

326
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,709
that are doable

327
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:23,840
but mustn't be done.

328
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,390
Fine. Fine.

329
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,070
My many years of teaching

330
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,320
have all been in vain.

331
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,780
Just for a man,

332
00:16:42,331 --> 00:16:43,691
your spirit and soul have turned upside down.

333
00:16:43,691 --> 00:16:45,211
You've totally forgotten my teachings.

334
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,270
You're not afraid of anything anymore.

335
00:16:47,492 --> 00:16:48,950
Since that's the case,

336
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,660
why must I still listen to your words?

337
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,990
I'm slow-witted

338
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:56,161
and stupid.

339
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,410
I'm unable to decide for you.

340
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,440
Grandmother,

341
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,520
I didn't forget.

342
00:17:04,889 --> 00:17:06,009
I know that

343
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,052
I shouldn't be and can't be thinking about it.

344
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,245
It's just that

345
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,510
Ming'er,

346
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,430
have you really decided

347
00:17:17,862 --> 00:17:19,189
and won't regret it?

348
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,904
Grandmother.

349
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,866
I dare not wishfully think

350
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
how well my future husband

351
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,560
will treat me.

352
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:30,814
I just hope that

353
00:17:30,814 --> 00:17:31,650
we can treat each other with respect.

354
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,368
That I can remain honest

355
00:17:33,368 --> 00:17:34,870
and preserve myself in this life.

356
00:17:35,158 --> 00:17:36,700
That's enough for me.

357
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:38,730
But now,

358
00:17:38,979 --> 00:17:41,513
the Young Lord is willing to fight for me.

359
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,605
He is a man raised

360
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:44,973
with a golden spoon.

361
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,722
A very privileged person.

362
00:17:46,722 --> 00:17:48,322
He has never suffered all his life.

363
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,302
Now he's

364
00:17:51,302 --> 00:17:53,382
contradicting his mother just for me.

365
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,310
He even ended up

366
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,510
in a state of not drinking or eating.

367
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,076
If at this time I become afraid and withdraw,

368
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,370
I will be like a traitor.

369
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,090
I

370
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:08,041
I will have wronged this affection

371
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,010
that he has for me.

372
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,870
Grandmother,

373
00:18:15,965 --> 00:18:17,212
I know that the House of Qi

374
00:18:17,212 --> 00:18:18,922
is like a tiger's lair, a dragon's den.

375
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,758
The Princess has a strong personality.

376
00:18:21,758 --> 00:18:22,844
The Duke is of high noble status,

377
00:18:22,844 --> 00:18:23,487
holding great power.

378
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,111
I'm only of humble position

379
00:18:24,111 --> 00:18:24,922
and my words carry not much weight.

380
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:26,890
If I marry into their family,

381
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,797
I surely will have to be vigilant day and night.

382
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,510
But just for

383
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,470
how Young Lord is treating me,

384
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,960
I'm willing to risk it all!

385
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,801
I'm willing, Grandmother!

386
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,076
Grandmother

387
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,890
Forgive me for being unfilial.

388
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,540
Just punish me.

389
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,410
Ming'er,

390
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,080
you will then

391
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,280
have endless hardships from now on.

392
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:20,525
Hurry up! Hurry up!

393
00:19:20,525 --> 00:19:21,974
Let's go now.Second Brother.

394
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,255
Go down.

395
00:19:23,255 --> 00:19:24,660
If we don't hurry,the carriage won't pass.

396
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,251
I heard that the Aoshan this year

397
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:26,820
is higher than last year.

398
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,645
If we're late, we won't be able to

399
00:19:27,645 --> 00:19:28,420
get a closer view.

400
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,716
Hurry! Hurry!

401
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:37,520
Look at her.

402
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,470
Isn't she wearing like that

403
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:41,643
just so she can meet some lord

404
00:19:41,643 --> 00:19:43,754
from a rich and noble family

405
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,886
and fulfill her beautiful dream

406
00:19:45,886 --> 00:19:47,580
of going up the social ranks?

407
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,260
Isn't it so?

408
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:56,120
What's wrong with you?

409
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:59,720
You're that afraid to make any comments on her?

410
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,111
If we still delay longer,

411
00:20:01,111 --> 00:20:01,900
we won't be there in time.

412
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,600
Coming! Coming!

413
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,000
He said that Sixth Miss must be

414
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
careful and be observant.

415
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,800
Follow Sister Cu, Elder Bao, and Master Guo.

416
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,600
Elder Bao, and Master Guo?

417
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,820
Aren't those ghost puppet characters?

418
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,164
With so many people here

419
00:20:50,164 --> 00:20:51,800
wearing ghost-like masks,

420
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,100
which one is his?

421
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,047
Reward this performer.

422
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,000
Pick up the money!

423
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,639
Miss, even if he comes,

424
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,398
you two won't be able to talk.

425
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,346
You find it too little?

426
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,720
I wish Miss a wonderful marriage

427
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,720
and a lot of blessings.

428
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,320
I think the Aoshan there is not bad.

429
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,000
It's higher than in the past.

430
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,200
Let's go take a look.

431
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,657
Keep close to me.

432
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,400
Quickly go! Quickly go!

433
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,200
Sixth Miss' hair has become messy.

434
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,680
I'll go in and comb her.

435
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,800
You two just wait here.

436
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,440
Yes.

437
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,000
It's really hard

438
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,600
to get a glimpse of you.

439
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,800
What has happened?

440
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,400
Young Master initially

441
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,600
refused to take in tea or food.

442
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,537
He kept going against the Duke

443
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:19,023
and Her Highness.

444
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,320
Last night,

445
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,200
he wouldn't even drink any water.

446
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,520
Everyone at home has gone to urge him,

447
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,400
but he won't listen.

448
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,600
He just locked up his doors

449
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,536
and won't let anyone in.

450
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,230
Is it because of that maidservant?

451
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,280
Then

452
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,888
Sixth Miss, I risked danger to see you

453
00:22:34,908 --> 00:22:36,400
just for an assurance from you.

454
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,105
I'll relay it to Young Master so he could

455
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:37,905
have something to look forward to.

456
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,000
It's just been a few days,

457
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,700
and he's already thin as bones.

458
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:44,800
Quickly go! Quickly run!

459
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,200
Go home! Go home!

460
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,198
Go home! Go home!

461
00:22:58,198 --> 00:22:59,400
Hurry!

462
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,350
Miss, the Patrol Guards

463
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,476
are asking people to go home.

464
00:23:01,476 --> 00:23:02,556
Don't know what has happened.

465
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,493
Are they after me?

466
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,960
No. People and horses

467
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,690
in the streets are all in a complete mess.

468
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:08,650
Don't know what has happened.

469
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,664
Miss, even if I get beaten to death,

470
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,810
I won't leak a word.

471
00:23:15,755 --> 00:23:17,505
Go back and tell Young Lord

472
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,335
that if he doesn't disappoint me,

473
00:23:19,335 --> 00:23:20,255
I won't be disloyal to him.

474
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,071
Yes.

475
00:23:22,071 --> 00:23:23,398
Go home!

476
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,300
A curfew is set!

477
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,305
Sixth Miss, this way please.

478
00:23:28,305 --> 00:23:29,265
A curfew is set!

479
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,160
Don't stay here anymore.

480
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,200
Leave.

481
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,200
Disperse! Go home!

482
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,800
Curfew! Quickly go home!

483
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,100
You hear us?! Quickly go home!

484
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,096
It's curfew time!

485
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,000
Go!

486
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,900
Disperse!

487
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,812
Go home!

488
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,680
Move aside! Move aside!

489
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,600
Close the main gate.

490
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,464
Yes.

491
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,440
The government received a memorial

492
00:24:04,849 --> 00:24:06,538
saying that the rebel self-proclaimed himself

493
00:24:06,538 --> 00:24:07,249
as "Emperor Zhaode"

494
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,891
and has already conquered the provinces

495
00:24:08,891 --> 00:24:09,840
and counties of Gui and Xun.

496
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,144
He's leading his army east, hence,

497
00:24:11,164 --> 00:24:12,600
we're now facing an urgent military crisis.

498
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,738
They were afraid that there are rebel spies

499
00:24:13,738 --> 00:24:14,460
that have infiltrated into the capital,

500
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,971
so they shut down the Lantern Festival

501
00:24:15,971 --> 00:24:17,077
and dispersed everyone.

502
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,260
Starting today,

503
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,631
morning court meetings are resumed

504
00:24:19,631 --> 00:24:21,191
and no officials will be allowed to ask for leave.

505
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,050
Those rebels

506
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,360
I remember how they caused trouble

507
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,720
in our hometown of Youyang earlier this year.

508
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,541
I initially thought that it was

509
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:29,354
just some minor ruckus.

510
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,155
Never thought that it would

511
00:24:31,155 --> 00:24:33,115
escalate to major battles.

512
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,023
The government now has problems

513
00:24:36,023 --> 00:24:36,726
internally and externally.

514
00:24:36,726 --> 00:24:38,160
This is so worrisome.

515
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:41,610
I've already strictly given orders to our house

516
00:24:42,257 --> 00:24:42,977
that if there are no emergent need,

517
00:24:42,977 --> 00:24:43,897
it's better to stay indoors.

518
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,080
Does Mother think that

519
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,480
I didn't handle it appropriately?

520
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,960
No, you handled it adequately.

521
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,640
I'm thinking that the government has been fighting

522
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,400
on the northern border ever since.

523
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,380
However, the Spring Lantern Festival

524
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,500
has gone on

525
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,682
and was never stopped.

526
00:25:08,906 --> 00:25:11,346
These rebels are not good at fighting,

527
00:25:11,842 --> 00:25:13,762
and are so far from here.

528
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,660
Why is the government this panicky

529
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,520
and had to close the Spring Lantern Festival?

530
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,900
What Mother said is very reasonable.

531
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,955
But if it wasn't the rebels,

532
00:25:24,955 --> 00:25:26,315
what else could it be?

533
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,480
His Majesty was well a few days ago.

534
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:32,500
The palace also didn't shut its gates.

535
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,442
There

536
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,320
has not been any major chaos that has happened.

537
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,953
You said earlier that

538
00:25:38,953 --> 00:25:40,393
the Patrol Guards were searching

539
00:25:40,393 --> 00:25:42,033
and dispersing people in the streets?

540
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,100
Yes.

541
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:43,980
I initially thought that it was

542
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,020
to prevent spies

543
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,500
from hiding inside the city.

544
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,040
If it wasn't to capture spies,

545
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,213
I feel that they were

546
00:25:53,253 --> 00:25:54,893
trying to capture a specific person.

547
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,014
Stopping the Spring Lantern Festival.

548
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:58,960
Sealing off the streets to capture someone.

549
00:25:59,628 --> 00:26:01,068
That has never happened before.

550
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,760
Your Main Wife

551
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,760
visited her brother's in-laws.

552
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,618
Maybe she'll bring us

553
00:26:08,618 --> 00:26:11,464
some news back?

554
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,560
Slow down, slow down!

555
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,840
Quickly get some ice to abate the pain.

556
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,100
I'm fine. I'm fine!

557
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,886
If I say it, you all might not believe it!

558
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,900
Last night,

559
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,983
the little sister of Imperial Consort Rong

560
00:26:30,983 --> 00:26:31,900
also went to observe the lanterns.

561
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,080
While traveling there,

562
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,519
some criminal just appeared and kidnapped her!

563
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,783
The little sister of Imperial Consort Rong

564
00:26:41,783 --> 00:26:42,600
Rong Feiyan?

565
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,559
Who else?

566
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,130
Imperial Consort Rong's legitimate sister?

567
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,819
How noble is that?

568
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,200
Right here in the city Bianjing?

569
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,680
She just got abducted

570
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,760
during the Spring Lantern Parade?

571
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,120
Could it be that your brother's in-laws

572
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,800
are spouting rubbish?

573
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,360
Master,

574
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,300
if you're unable to find out anything,

575
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,684
don't belittle the connections of

576
00:27:10,684 --> 00:27:12,213
our Wang relatives here in the capital.

577
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,281
You can't be an official.

578
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,800
I just said a few words to spice up the discussion

579
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,700
and you just had to make a personal attack!

580
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,480
Fine. Fine.

581
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,421
I just wish that you would tell it quickly.

582
00:27:27,421 --> 00:27:28,886
We all are getting anxious.

583
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,220
They say this Second Miss of the House of Rong

584
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,270
is so unlucky.

585
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,715
That street is so crowded that

586
00:27:34,715 --> 00:27:36,235
even water can't seep through.

587
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,956
She just had to get down from her carriage

588
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:38,736
and look at that huge Aoshan.

589
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,000
There were so many servants surrounding her,

590
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,125
but in an instant, she was just gone!

591
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,960
Could she have bumped into

592
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,020
or seen some nasty things?

593
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,241
Right under the feet of the Emperor,

594
00:27:53,241 --> 00:27:54,800
during the grand Spring Lantern Festival,

595
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,922
a noble daughter disappeared?

596
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,720
It will be chaos soon.

597
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:04,182
Our family must always be careful.

598
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,300
Big Madam, the ice is here.

599
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,900
Move aside!

600
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,000
Someone fell down.

601
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,378
Move aside. Move back. Move back.

602
00:28:39,378 --> 00:28:40,200
Don't move forward.

603
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,600
Move back. I'm talking to you!

604
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,000
Move back. Move back.

605
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,700
Isn't this the lady from the House of Rong?

606
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,651
"Anti-extravagance"

607
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,185
What's so extravagant about the Spring Lantern Festival

608
00:29:02,185 --> 00:29:03,848
that they had to stop it?

609
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,067
With the rebels in the south,

610
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,817
there are now people bold enough

611
00:29:07,817 --> 00:29:09,000
to kidnap noble daughters.

612
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,440
The streets lately

613
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,240
aren't that safe.

614
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,560
Why must they remove the lanterns and the Aoshan?

615
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,440
A good Spring Lantern Festival just got destroyed

616
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,928
by that Rong Feiyan.

617
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,960
Stop saying nonsense.

618
00:29:19,663 --> 00:29:21,372
This incident was quite scary.

619
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,800
That House of Rong were

620
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,395
originally tile craftsmen.

621
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,461
Rong Feiyan has always been

622
00:29:26,461 --> 00:29:26,863
arrogant and overbearing

623
00:29:26,863 --> 00:29:27,783
because of her relationship

624
00:29:27,783 --> 00:29:29,400
with Imperial Consort Rong.

625
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,560
During every cultural gathering,

626
00:29:30,805 --> 00:29:32,400
she would look down on people.

627
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,882
She even keeps attaching herself

628
00:29:33,882 --> 00:29:34,800
to Brother Yuanruo.

629
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,480
Shut up.

630
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,800
Let me tell you this,

631
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,520
she probably won't survive this time.

632
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,460
You mustn't spout such nonsense outside

633
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,582
and just keep it to yourself!

634
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,756
Second Young Miss is gone!

635
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,100
Quickly open the doors!

636
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,000
Is there anyone inside?

637
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,480
Open the doors!

638
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,323
Open the doors!

639
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,263
How is it?

640
00:31:43,263 --> 00:31:45,400
Is it more peaceful outside?

641
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,000
The streets aren't chaotic anymore.

642
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,083
Businesses have started opening up

643
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:55,400
and there are a lot of people now outside.

644
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,900
But most of them are still patrol guards.

645
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,600
It's been so long,

646
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,536
but the people who harmed Second Young Miss Rong

647
00:32:03,536 --> 00:32:04,696
haven't been caught.

648
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,794
They are bandits.

649
00:32:06,794 --> 00:32:09,000
How can they easily be caught?

650
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,920
Why not?

651
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,908
Here in the capital,

652
00:32:12,908 --> 00:32:14,748
each household has security.

653
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,640
Those foreigners also have guides and escorts.

654
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,840
Every person and animal in each household

655
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,200
are registered in the census.

656
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,400
How come they couldn't catch them?

657
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,400
Even if it's a cat,

658
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,400
they surely should have caught it by now.

659
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,840
I even heard that

660
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,305
Royal Uncle Rong Chang cried

661
00:32:30,305 --> 00:32:32,600
and caused a ruckus in Wende Palace Hall.

662
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,460
Imperial Consort Rong has fainted from crying

663
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,400
in the inner palace three times.

664
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,154
Her Highness the Empress has convinced His Majesty

665
00:32:37,154 --> 00:32:38,800
and the Imperial Palace Guard has been sent out to help.

666
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,663
When I passed by the local magistrate's office,

667
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,634
the Rong Family are blocking its gates

668
00:32:42,634 --> 00:32:43,136
and won't leave.

669
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,680
I heard that the local governor

670
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,840
hasn't shown up himself for several days already.

671
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,221
With it being so chaotic outside,

672
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,348
have you seen Buwei?

673
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,320
I've circled around outside for a long time.

674
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,738
Not only Buwei,

675
00:32:57,738 --> 00:32:59,459
I didn't even see any swallows.

676
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,480
Miss, starting tomorrow,

677
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,779
I'll go around

678
00:33:08,779 --> 00:33:10,046
to the House of Duke Qi of the State.

679
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,255
Buwei will surely come out one day, right?

680
00:33:13,255 --> 00:33:14,241
I'll be able to wait for him.

681
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,795
If he wants to,

682
00:33:18,795 --> 00:33:19,995
he will be able to pass the message out.

683
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,467
It's we who should be careful

684
00:33:24,467 --> 00:33:26,600
to keep our composure

685
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,200
and not let others capture any weakness.

686
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,521
Yes.

687
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,400
Since I'm unable to see the Young Lord,

688
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,380
I'll go to Yuqing Monastery

689
00:33:35,649 --> 00:33:37,218
to see my auntie instead first.

690
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,400
With it being so chaotic outside,

691
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,320
I fear that Master and Big Madam

692
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,372
won't allow you to go out.

693
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,060
You're going out?

694
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,000
It's currently dangerous outside.

695
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,408
Your father repeatedly instructed

696
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,640
that the women must stay at home,

697
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,321
but you just have to give me problems.

698
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,729
Earlier this year,

699
00:34:00,729 --> 00:34:02,000
Father had promised me about this.

700
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,760
Just because I was too busy, it got delayed.

701
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,762
Last night, I had a dream

702
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,320
about Little Mother.

703
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,966
She blamed me for breaking my promise.

704
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,360
Since the Spring Lantern Festival has passed,

705
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,120
I came here to especially get your permission.

706
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,237
Since the Master is the one

707
00:34:20,237 --> 00:34:21,062
who promised you this,

708
00:34:21,062 --> 00:34:22,791
you should go beg him.

709
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,920
Even though I'm the Big Madam,

710
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,720
I dare not casually decide for him.

711
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,253
When Father went to greet Grandmother this morning,

712
00:34:30,253 --> 00:34:31,453
I've already told him about it.

713
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,720
Father asked me to seek your permission.

714
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,640
He said that internal house matters,

715
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,200
the sending out of servants and carriages,

716
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,240
are all still under your jurisdiction.

717
00:34:43,366 --> 00:34:44,812
That's right too.

718
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,414
Now the Master will ask me about everything first

719
00:34:48,414 --> 00:34:49,842
before making decisions.

720
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,071
Go then.

721
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,040
Prepare everything today

722
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,760
and set out by dawn tomorrow.

723
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,360
You must be back before sunset.

724
00:35:01,568 --> 00:35:03,114
Don't get delayed.

725
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,600
Thank you, Big Madam.

726
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,100
You two stay here and guard.

727
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,528
Auntie must be encountering problems at home,

728
00:35:37,528 --> 00:35:38,749
and is embarrassed to ask my help.

729
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,500
I'll go chat with her for a while.

730
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,546
Good child, you're finally here.

731
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,482
Upon entering the capital,

732
00:35:54,482 --> 00:35:55,602
a big criminal case occurred.

733
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,157
I was afraid that a rich daughter like you

734
00:35:57,157 --> 00:35:58,706
won't be able to come out of the house.

735
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,522
Auntie, what is it? Why are you in a hurry?

736
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,820
I've brought someone.

737
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:09,420
It's Xiaodie.

738
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,700
Sister Xiaodie?

739
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,011
Miss.

740
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,827
Miss.

741
00:36:16,827 --> 00:36:18,467
You're already this big.

742
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,880
Sister Xiaodie.

743
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,720
Did Xiaotao

744
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,550
take care of you well?

745
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,797
She took care of me well.

746
00:36:26,797 --> 00:36:28,537
She's just outside.

747
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,200
Quickly sit down.

748
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,200
You are so pretty.

749
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:40,840
Oh, right.

750
00:36:41,062 --> 00:36:42,490
For so many years,

751
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:44,000
I've thought of

752
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,828
returning this to you.

753
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,600
This is Little Miss' only dowry left.

754
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,112
From now on,

755
00:36:50,112 --> 00:36:51,941
it will accompany you when you get married.

756
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,709
You didn't use this?

757
00:36:56,709 --> 00:36:57,514
Then

758
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,933
How did you survive?

759
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,723
In peaceful times,

760
00:37:03,085 --> 00:37:04,927
how can you not find a way to survive?

761
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,900
Here, let me place it on your hand.

762
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,960
I know that

763
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,760
you didn't steal those items.

764
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,500
You were framed.

765
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,240
My matters are in the past.

766
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,440
What's important is Mistress Wei.

767
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,393
We've thought about it.

768
00:37:33,393 --> 00:37:35,200
Other than Mistress Lin,

769
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,094
there can't be anyone else.

770
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,360
I've also brought

771
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,930
a doctor with me.

772
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,680
Wait here. I'll go get him.

773
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,119
You have found him?

774
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,848
It's Doctor Zhang who

775
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:48,913
treated our Mistress Wei before.

776
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,100
Doctor Zhang.

777
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,796
I just returned from picking herbs

778
00:37:51,796 --> 00:37:52,814
on the countryside.

779
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,200
I haven't even entered the city gates

780
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,235
when you two dragged me to travel

781
00:37:55,235 --> 00:37:56,600
several miles here to Biancheng.

782
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,151
There's still a pile of sick people

783
00:37:58,151 --> 00:37:59,200
waiting for me at home.

784
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,600
Don't be mad. Please calm down.

785
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,320
Sit. Please sit down.

786
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,320
Quickly ask your questions.

787
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,687
Doctor, do you still remember

788
00:38:11,687 --> 00:38:13,698
what happened that day?

789
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,200
Only a ghost will remember things that long ago.

790
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,160
I have several tens of thousands of patients.

791
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,048
If I can remember

792
00:38:19,048 --> 00:38:19,993
everything about all of them,

793
00:38:19,993 --> 00:38:21,542
can I still be alive?

794
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,618
I apologize, Doctor.

795
00:38:31,618 --> 00:38:33,991
My auntie was just too concerned.

796
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,780
Hope Doctor Zhang can

797
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,220
recall that incident

798
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,800
when you examined my Little Mother,

799
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,763
so as to untie this knot in my heart

800
00:38:39,763 --> 00:38:40,640
that has been here for many years.

801
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,960
I'm also not venting my anger on you.

802
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,280
It's just that

803
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,340
I've repeatedly explained to your relative

804
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,836
that this matter has happened so long ago.

805
00:38:52,836 --> 00:38:54,476
I really can't remember it anymore!

806
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,240
I can't just bluff to you, right?

807
00:38:56,489 --> 00:38:58,000
It will just delay things.

808
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,769
But she won't believe me

809
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:00,378
and insisted on dragging me here!

810
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,400
You must recall it.

811
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,676
If it has nothing to do with you,

812
00:39:03,676 --> 00:39:04,756
there won't be anyone else

813
00:39:04,756 --> 00:39:06,716
going outside your house to monitor you.

814
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,760
I really can't remember anymore!

815
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,419
I can't just make up things, right?

816
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:27,750
I remember that when you examined my mother,

817
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,480
there was a noble young lord that had

818
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,580
fallen into the water in Yangzhou.

819
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,698
There were soldiers everywhere in our house.

820
00:39:32,698 --> 00:39:33,844
The whole city of Yangzhou was also

821
00:39:33,844 --> 00:39:34,770
focused on searching for him.

822
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,898
Hurry up! Hurry up!

823
00:39:39,898 --> 00:39:40,800
Hurry up!

824
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,400
Doctor.

825
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,700
Doctor, no need to worry.

826
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,580
Just make sure to

827
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:50,100
examine Mistress Wei properly.

828
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,597
I remember. I remember.

829
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,500
Your house was quite unique.

830
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,418
It was the Mistress Lin

831
00:40:01,418 --> 00:40:02,160
that was stewarding the house,

832
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,131
and not the Big Madam.

833
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,426
That's right. That was my house.

834
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,174
When your house invited me,

835
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,891
I was even very happy,

836
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,264
because I would have

837
00:40:13,264 --> 00:40:14,853
a long-term working relationship

838
00:40:14,853 --> 00:40:16,080
with an official from now on.

839
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,091
But when I arrived at your home that day,

840
00:40:18,091 --> 00:40:19,291
there were soldiers everywhere.

841
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,200
I was so scared.

842
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,120
I was thinking then

843
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,300
that if I got invited again,

844
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,920
what excuses could I

845
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,400
come up with to refuse it?

846
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,483
But afterwards,

847
00:40:27,483 --> 00:40:29,334
no one asked for me again.

848
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,848
Yes. What happened that day?

849
00:40:31,848 --> 00:40:33,528
Do you still remember?

850
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,800
I first, I

851
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,200
went to examine Mistress Lin.

852
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,190
Afterwards, I went to examine

853
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,600
another one who was pregnant!

854
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,440
She seemed to

855
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,000
be giving birth soon.

856
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,471
Right. Right.

857
00:40:51,471 --> 00:40:53,468
What happened that day?

858
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,439
After examining the pregnant woman,

859
00:40:55,439 --> 00:40:57,450
I went back to talk with the Mistress Wei.

860
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,703
I told her that the pregnant woman's child

861
00:40:59,703 --> 00:41:00,360
is a bit too big,

862
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,977
but it's not a big problem.

863
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,303
She just had to watch the pregnant woman

864
00:41:03,303 --> 00:41:04,600
to not overly-nourish herself,

865
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,360
eat lighter-flavored meals and walk more often,

866
00:41:06,682 --> 00:41:09,430
she surely would safely give birth.

867
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,180
Eating this for breakfast

868
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,600
is too wasteful.

869
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,820
Mistress, you've suffered a shock.

870
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,852
You should rest peacefully and not walk around!

871
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,996
Alarming the snake because of hitting the grass

872
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:40,800
Never thought that the snake was like that.

873
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,524
So what really

874
00:41:46,524 --> 00:41:49,100
was going on?

875
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,548
That Little Mother died

876
00:41:54,548 --> 00:41:57,123
from hemorrhaging during childbirth.

877
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,400
She died

878
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,880
with the child in her womb.

879
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,555
What!

880
00:42:06,555 --> 00:42:08,265
That's impossible!

881
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,256
As long as she eats less and moves more,

882
00:42:10,618 --> 00:42:12,890
that child should have been delivered safely!

883
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,746
What if someone kept stuffing her

884
00:42:15,746 --> 00:42:17,617
with very nutritious and delicious food,

885
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,171
and even asked her to rest more?

886
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,280
Isn't that asking for trouble?

887
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,294
She surely would have a large fetus

888
00:42:24,294 --> 00:42:26,160
that's going to make her labor difficult!

889
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,549
Do you dare to swear by the heavens

890
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:32,480
that you haven't spoken any lies?

891
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,120
I swear by the heavens that I didn't tell any lies.

892
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,000
That Minglan

893
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,040
went out again today.

894
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,402
She said that she went to Yuqing Monastery

895
00:42:54,402 --> 00:42:55,240
for some Buddhist ritual.

896
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,440
How can there be so many religious rituals?

897
00:42:58,269 --> 00:43:00,220
She must be up to something.

898
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,849
Mistress, don't worry.

899
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:04,518
My man has been

900
00:43:04,518 --> 00:43:05,685
in Yangzhou guarding them.

901
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,040
That Doctor Zhang

902
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,446
who once examined Mistress Wei

903
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,859
never showed up.

904
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,554
Without any evidence,

905
00:43:14,554 --> 00:43:16,316
what trouble can they create?
