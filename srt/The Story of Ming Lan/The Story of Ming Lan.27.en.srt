00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,700
Episode 27

3
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:04,829
Don't worry, Mistress.

4
00:01:05,709 --> 00:01:07,189
My man has been watching on standby

5
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:08,149
in Yangzhou for many days.

6
00:01:08,949 --> 00:01:10,229
That Physician Zhang

7
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:12,469
who examined Mistress Wei back then

8
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:13,709
hasn't made any moves.

9
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:17,269
Without any evidence,

10
00:01:17,269 --> 00:01:18,749
what turbulence can she cause?

11
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:21,349
Be that as it may,

12
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,825
Minglan is no longer someone

13
00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:26,069
with no one

14
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:27,309
to lean on like before.

15
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:31,589
If something unfavorable shows up,

16
00:01:32,349 --> 00:01:34,029
that old lady in the house

17
00:01:34,029 --> 00:01:35,669
will rise for sure,

18
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:39,269
and back her up.

19
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:42,669
Mistress, you needn't worry.

20
00:01:43,949 --> 00:01:45,669
Master dotes on you, doesn't he?

21
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:49,269
Furthermore,

22
00:01:49,269 --> 00:01:51,549
this has the Sheng House honor involved.

23
00:01:52,669 --> 00:01:53,589
The Master will naturally

24
00:01:53,589 --> 00:01:54,989
not allow anyone to bring up old scores again,

25
00:01:55,869 --> 00:01:56,709
or else

26
00:01:57,189 --> 00:01:58,389
how can he not

27
00:01:58,389 --> 00:01:59,589
be guilty of neglect?

28
00:02:00,749 --> 00:02:03,349
When our Miss marries into a lofty house,

29
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:06,429
who will dare then to speak ill of you?

30
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,429
In terms of marriage prospects,

31
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:14,629
when the old Marquis passed away

32
00:02:14,629 --> 00:02:16,429
various houses set up canopies to pay tribute.

33
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:17,829
That head madam

34
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:19,309
now says she will hold a banquet in gratitude

35
00:02:19,309 --> 00:02:21,269
and invited many noble acquaintances.

36
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:23,829
The Duke Qi House and our house

37
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:24,829
are among the invitees.

38
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:26,509
Princess Pingning

39
00:02:26,509 --> 00:02:28,509
even sent someone to deliver words to us

40
00:02:28,509 --> 00:02:29,869
asking us to come too.

41
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:40,509
That Young Lord of hers.

42
00:02:41,869 --> 00:02:43,029
He looks clever...

43
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:45,789
but he is actually blind.

44
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:47,589
Yes

45
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:49,349
Sixth Miss at the Polo match incident,

46
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:51,389
that's caused quite a wild stir.

47
00:02:53,429 --> 00:02:56,269
We should watch

48
00:02:56,269 --> 00:02:57,469
how the Princess handles it.

49
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:04,149
The Young Lord is blind,

50
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:05,469
but the other houses aren't blind.

51
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:08,029
This big banquet of the Gu House.

52
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,429
They've invited many high officials

53
00:03:10,429 --> 00:03:11,349
and their families.

54
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:13,309
This is a great opportunity for our Mo'er

55
00:03:13,309 --> 00:03:14,789
to show her talent.

56
00:03:15,149 --> 00:03:15,909
At the time,

57
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:17,149
I want everyone to know that

58
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:18,469
in our Sheng House,

59
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:20,189
we have such a beautiful

60
00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:21,749
and interesting girl.

61
00:03:22,749 --> 00:03:24,509
Princess Pingning is not fond of us.

62
00:03:25,749 --> 00:03:27,629
But in Bianjing,

63
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:29,189
there are lots of wealthy houses.

64
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:30,629
Our Mo'er won't die

65
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:32,309
hanging on one tree.

66
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,150
Indeed.

67
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:50,309
How did you get the thought to

68
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:51,709
pray to the ancestors suddenly?

69
00:03:53,029 --> 00:03:54,029
No need to get up.

70
00:03:55,909 --> 00:03:56,658
I saw Grandfather in my dream

71
00:03:56,658 --> 00:03:57,309
the day before yesterday.

72
00:03:58,509 --> 00:04:00,749
He said we granddaughters

73
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:02,789
don't come and burn incense to him

74
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:03,829
so I came.

75
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:11,309
Among these children of mine,

76
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:13,549
you are the most sensible and obedient one.

77
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:17,629
I am very consoled.

78
00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:22,909
Father,

79
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:24,749
do you still remember

80
00:04:24,749 --> 00:04:25,829
what Little Mother Wei looked like?

81
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:30,429
How wretchedly did she die!

82
00:04:31,549 --> 00:04:33,789
When I think about it now, I feel so sad.

83
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:36,749
Father, tell me.

84
00:04:36,749 --> 00:04:38,429
You have so many children.

85
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:40,309
How is it that only my Little Mother

86
00:04:40,309 --> 00:04:41,509
exprienced such difficult labor?

87
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:43,989
Two lives gone at once.

88
00:04:46,549 --> 00:04:48,949
Is it because of ill fate,

89
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,749
or is it due to some other reason?

90
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:55,629
A woman in labor

91
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:57,669
is always on a trip to hell.

92
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:01,949
Your Little Mother just wasn't lucky...

93
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:06,989
and this was a tragedy,

94
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:10,789
so don't think about it too much anymore.

95
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:15,189
Father,

96
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:17,709
when I was attacked by water bandits

97
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:18,909
and sank into the river during my recent trip,

98
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:20,989
I thought my life was done.

99
00:05:20,989 --> 00:05:22,189
But vaguely,

100
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:25,429
I thought I saw my Little Mother

101
00:05:25,429 --> 00:05:26,669
reaching her hand out,

102
00:05:26,949 --> 00:05:28,029
pulling me up!

103
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:29,389
It seemed she wanted to say something.

104
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,149
What did she say?

105
00:05:44,429 --> 00:05:46,029
I just don't know what she said,

106
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:47,149
and that's why I am panicking.

107
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:52,789
Maybe you are possessed by some demon

108
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:54,069
to talk this nonsense.

109
00:05:55,269 --> 00:05:56,149
In Youyang,

110
00:05:56,149 --> 00:05:57,551
I saw the Eldest House Grandmother

111
00:05:57,551 --> 00:05:58,389
take her last breath.

112
00:05:59,269 --> 00:06:00,589
She died.

113
00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:03,549
Died...

114
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:06,949
without peace.

115
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,549
I was so scared.

116
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,389
That's enough.

117
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:20,109
You are too young to know the weight of things.

118
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:24,909
You are not allowed to mention these matters again,

119
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:27,589
or it may cause disharmony in the family.

120
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:32,869
There's another matter

121
00:06:32,869 --> 00:06:34,269
I'd like to seek your approval about.

122
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:36,629
Speak.

123
00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:38,509
I heard from someone

124
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:39,505
that when you see the deceased soul

125
00:06:39,505 --> 00:06:40,069
of your family member,

126
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:41,269
it's because

127
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:42,149
the dead

128
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:44,709
are not in peace in the underworld,

129
00:06:45,109 --> 00:06:46,429
and we need to perform a ritual

130
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:47,869
to help them transcend.

131
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:54,549
That's proper.

132
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:56,415
Since your Big Madam is in charge now,

133
00:06:57,629 --> 00:06:58,789
whatever amount of money you need for it,

134
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:00,269
get it from her.

135
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:03,189
My Little Mother is buried all alone

136
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,349
in the Yangzhou countryside.

137
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,340
She is easily bullied by wild spirits

138
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,109
and wandering souls.

139
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:10,297
Father, you are a palace graduate

140
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:11,589
of the Imperial court exam.

141
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:12,789
You possess great yang energy.

142
00:07:13,549 --> 00:07:16,389
I would like to request

143
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:17,829
that you give me a few drops of blood.

144
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:19,549
Drop them into cinnabar,

145
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,189
so I can inscribe my mother's tablet

146
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:23,309
one more time with it...

147
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:27,229
to calm those small ghosts!

148
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:30,429
Please regard it as a grace to me

149
00:07:30,429 --> 00:07:32,469
and my Little Mother Wei.

150
00:07:35,109 --> 00:07:36,829
Confucius said this, "Respect ghosts and spirits,

151
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:39,829
but keep them at a distance."

152
00:07:41,499 --> 00:07:43,469
We are an honest family of scholars.

153
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:44,749
You can't speak of this strange "spirit and ghost"

154
00:07:44,749 --> 00:07:46,229
reasoning anymore.

155
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:49,469
And you really should not

156
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,389
ask your father to damage his body.

157
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:57,989
Father, you are right.

158
00:07:58,989 --> 00:08:00,189
I was improper.

159
00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:03,269
Then when I carry out the ritual,

160
00:08:03,269 --> 00:08:04,349
may you attend

161
00:08:04,989 --> 00:08:06,469
and light the three incense sticks personally?

162
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,909
Light up my Little Mother's soul?

163
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:17,949
It's a great chaotic time of turmoil and war.

164
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:18,869
You should be home actually

165
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,509
and cultivating yourself,

166
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:22,669
but you must carry out this hapless act?

167
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,229
Where's your propriety?

168
00:08:25,469 --> 00:08:26,589
Father.

169
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,309
My Little Mother was your pillow mate.

170
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:30,509
Enough.

171
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:32,589
I see you were startled.

172
00:08:32,589 --> 00:08:33,509
Go rest early.

173
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:43,229
Miss.

174
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:45,389
Since the Master won't give drops of blood,

175
00:08:45,909 --> 00:08:46,909
do you think

176
00:08:47,909 --> 00:08:48,869
we should go find someone

177
00:08:48,869 --> 00:08:50,269
with strong fate,

178
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:52,269
and inscribe your Little Mother's tablet?

179
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,429
No need.

180
00:08:57,429 --> 00:08:58,789
I made that up anyway.

181
00:09:02,469 --> 00:09:03,189
Xiaotao.

182
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:06,589
If your fate was strong,

183
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:08,556
would you be willing to give

184
00:09:08,556 --> 00:09:09,469
drops of blood for my mother?

185
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,909
I am willing, of course.

186
00:09:11,909 --> 00:09:13,469
She treated me so well!

187
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,549
If there were cakes,

188
00:09:15,549 --> 00:09:17,189
she would save some for me to eat.

189
00:09:21,669 --> 00:09:22,749
Even you're willing....

190
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,189
but my mother's pillow mate,

191
00:09:27,189 --> 00:09:28,189
he isn't willing?

192
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:32,869
You are a dependable person.

193
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:35,869
He is just not a dependable person.

194
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:39,349
Then, what do we do?

195
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:46,629
The dead person below can't sleep soundly,

196
00:09:48,189 --> 00:09:49,949
so how can the living person

197
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:51,269
above sleep soundly?

198
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,709
Mother, did you see?

199
00:10:31,749 --> 00:10:33,429
That's the Duke Qi House's carriage.

200
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,229
This means Brother Yuanruo must be here too.

201
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:37,069
And there!

202
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,389
That's Duke Ying Manor's carriage.

203
00:10:39,189 --> 00:10:40,469
Isn't that house usually uninterested

204
00:10:40,469 --> 00:10:42,130
in attending these events?

205
00:10:42,189 --> 00:10:43,469
Why are they here?

206
00:10:44,429 --> 00:10:45,469
Look,

207
00:10:45,469 --> 00:10:46,669
that's the couple indeed.

208
00:10:46,669 --> 00:10:48,309
No one else.

209
00:10:48,309 --> 00:10:48,709
Let's go.

210
00:10:49,229 --> 00:10:49,949
Greetings, Madam.

211
00:10:49,989 --> 00:10:50,869
Hello to you.

212
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,709
The daughter of Prince Yong's house is here too!

213
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:53,389
Stop making a fuss.

214
00:10:53,789 --> 00:10:54,629
Yelling and babbling,

215
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:55,589
do you see

216
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:56,549
other ladies doing this?

217
00:11:36,189 --> 00:11:37,949
That Duchess Ying.

218
00:11:42,629 --> 00:11:43,789
Everyone.

219
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:47,069
The old Marquis' funeral procession,

220
00:11:47,669 --> 00:11:49,509
you all set up tribute stations

221
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:50,949
along the way.

222
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:52,949
I am beyond grateful.

223
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:56,389
Because we are still amid the mourning period,

224
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:58,189
we've done away with all red-colored decorations.

225
00:11:58,469 --> 00:11:59,749
As for tunes and operas,

226
00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:02,029
we will only perform the yearning ones.

227
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:03,869
May you be forgiving of

228
00:12:03,869 --> 00:12:05,309
our deficiency as host.

229
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:10,109
Madam Qin,

230
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:11,509
since Old Marquis passed away,

231
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:13,349
you have had to manage this grand marquis manor.

232
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:15,869
It is such a toil and burden.

233
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,229
Putting together this small banquet

234
00:12:18,229 --> 00:12:20,309
to enjoy and share some laughter,

235
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:21,709
it's only a very natural conduct.

236
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:22,549
Yes.

237
00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:25,509
Princess Consort is completely right.

238
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:51,669
The Princess

239
00:13:51,669 --> 00:13:53,349
usually speaks so haughtily.

240
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:54,830
Her nostrils are usually pointing

241
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:55,669
to the sky when she talks.

242
00:13:56,229 --> 00:13:58,069
But before the Princess Consort Yong,

243
00:13:58,429 --> 00:13:59,109
she's acting like a rat

244
00:13:59,109 --> 00:14:00,269
hiding from the cat.

245
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:02,349
Do you know why?

246
00:14:05,549 --> 00:14:06,709
Third Miss, may you be well.

247
00:14:08,869 --> 00:14:10,149
Stop that act with me.

248
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:17,949
Do you still think

249
00:14:17,949 --> 00:14:18,949
you got to play jiju

250
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:19,989
with the Young Lord,

251
00:14:20,749 --> 00:14:22,029
and he's going to lift you up and let you

252
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:23,469
become a concubine in the ducal manor?

253
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:26,789
Let me tell you.

254
00:14:27,229 --> 00:14:28,509
The Princess has already picked out

255
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,469
Prince Yong's daughter

256
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:30,349
as her daughter-in-law.

257
00:14:34,189 --> 00:14:35,509
This Prince Yong is someone

258
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:36,181
who will enter the palace

259
00:14:36,181 --> 00:14:36,909
by way of the Eastern Palace

260
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,989
so naturally,

261
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:40,269
even the Princess is speaking with her voice

262
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:41,429
and head lowered to Princess Consort Yong.

263
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,709
Look.

264
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:52,789
The one in purple clothing,

265
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:55,509
that's Prince Yong's daughter,

266
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:56,469
Princess Jiacheng.

267
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,189
Princess Pingning

268
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:06,469
grew up in the palace.

269
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:08,429
She gets to go

270
00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:09,549
as she pleases in the entire palace.

271
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:11,509
I guess

272
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:13,029
she must have knew some hearsay

273
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:15,069
to select someone

274
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:17,309
who is inferior to you

275
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:18,309
in looks and figure?

276
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:23,909
Sister,

277
00:15:23,909 --> 00:15:24,989
your plans are in vain.

278
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,909
The young princess is lucky.

279
00:15:38,429 --> 00:15:39,309
I heard

280
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:41,509
this Imperial Consort Rong's house

281
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:42,829
was smitten with the Young Lord too.

282
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,029
It's just a pity though that Rong Feiyan

283
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:46,829
is unlucky with a short life.

284
00:15:48,509 --> 00:15:50,349
She can't afford such a nice match.

285
00:15:51,989 --> 00:15:53,149
With her death,

286
00:15:53,549 --> 00:15:54,509
Princess Pingning and Prince Yong's houses

287
00:15:54,549 --> 00:15:56,109
are starting to make acquaintances.

288
00:15:59,549 --> 00:16:01,309
The Duke of Qi House is so smart.

289
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:03,309
When you cut into tofu, both sides are shiny.

290
00:16:10,909 --> 00:16:11,909
But then again,

291
00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:16,149
among my ancestors,

292
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:17,589
we've had an Imperial tutor,

293
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,269
so we're different from your family.

294
00:16:20,789 --> 00:16:21,909
As it's commonly said,

295
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:23,869
"you can seal a jar,

296
00:16:23,869 --> 00:16:25,069
but not a human mouth."

297
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:28,309
Your petty mindset of your petty family,

298
00:16:28,549 --> 00:16:29,549
I think it's best you let that

299
00:16:29,549 --> 00:16:30,549
shove back into your mother's belly.

300
00:16:52,989 --> 00:16:54,589
Which official house's daughter

301
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:55,429
is the one at the end of the table?

302
00:16:55,629 --> 00:16:56,989
I've never seen her.

303
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,370
She was brought here

304
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:02,269
by the Big Madam of Sheng House.

305
00:17:03,749 --> 00:17:04,829
Didn't your Heng'er

306
00:17:04,989 --> 00:17:06,109
study at

307
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:06,989
Sheng House before?

308
00:17:07,469 --> 00:17:08,869
The two houses are well-acquainted,

309
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,269
so they are naturally acquainted

310
00:17:10,269 --> 00:17:11,909
with us too.

311
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,109
When the old Marquis passed away,

312
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,789
Sheng House set up a path tribute too.

313
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,269
So that's the one from Sheng House.

314
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:21,589
She's the one.

315
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:27,269
Then summon her, and let me look at her more closely.

316
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:29,949
By the way,

317
00:17:31,189 --> 00:17:34,589
I just remembered something amusing.

318
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:37,189
A few days ago,

319
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:38,709
we had a joke at home.

320
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,909
Over some petty matters,

321
00:17:40,909 --> 00:17:43,229
the maidservants started to quibble.

322
00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:45,389
A kitchen maid assigned to boil water

323
00:17:45,589 --> 00:17:47,869
dared to scold my own handmaid.

324
00:17:48,729 --> 00:17:49,880
It had me wanting to cry

325
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,069
and laugh at the same time.

326
00:17:51,309 --> 00:17:53,349
So how did you handle it, Princess?

327
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,349
Handle what?

328
00:17:55,349 --> 00:17:56,949
Just a water maid.

329
00:17:56,989 --> 00:17:58,149
In her whole life,

330
00:17:58,149 --> 00:18:00,029
she's never entered the Master's room.

331
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,829
A thing that can't be prevented.

332
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,269
Did you see that?

333
00:18:03,269 --> 00:18:04,340
Those two are pointing to the mulberry tree

334
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,149
but cursing at the locust tree.

335
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,509
Who are they talking about?

336
00:18:07,509 --> 00:18:08,629
You should know that.

337
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:13,229
My ears don't work well so I didn't hear it.

338
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,069
I couldn't hear as clearly as you could,

339
00:18:16,069 --> 00:18:17,189
Sister Yanhong.

340
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:19,109
Now

341
00:18:19,109 --> 00:18:20,629
these fools

342
00:18:20,629 --> 00:18:21,869
who don't know their place are so many!

343
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:23,949
Each and every one of them,

344
00:18:23,989 --> 00:18:25,709
thinking they have got a drop of dew

345
00:18:25,749 --> 00:18:26,949
from a ducal or marquis house,

346
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,069
and they have some status now too.

347
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,069
When I hear of such things,

348
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,389
I find it funny.

349
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,749
I'm even too lazy to get angry.

350
00:18:37,109 --> 00:18:37,749
Here.

351
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:38,909
They can't tell when something's good.

352
00:18:47,749 --> 00:18:49,269
Sixth Miss. Sixth Miss!

353
00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:52,149
You came out for a convenience too, Madam?

354
00:18:52,309 --> 00:18:53,349
What convenience?

355
00:18:54,029 --> 00:18:55,109
I just can't stand watching those

356
00:18:55,109 --> 00:18:56,549
fakers making oblique-scolding remarks,

357
00:18:56,949 --> 00:18:57,909
so I came out to get some fresh air.

358
00:18:59,749 --> 00:19:01,029
Good child,

359
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:02,589
don't take it to heart.

360
00:19:02,869 --> 00:19:04,149
They love to gossip,

361
00:19:04,149 --> 00:19:05,269
and let them!

362
00:19:06,909 --> 00:19:08,349
My ears don't work too well and it was so far away,

363
00:19:08,349 --> 00:19:09,669
so I couldn't hear them.

364
00:19:10,629 --> 00:19:13,229
That's right. There you go!

365
00:19:13,229 --> 00:19:14,389
We won't listen to them.

366
00:19:14,989 --> 00:19:16,109
In a few days,

367
00:19:16,269 --> 00:19:18,349
I've invited some close friends to come and play jiju,

368
00:19:18,349 --> 00:19:19,509
and you're good at playing jiju.

369
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,549
Why don't you come and have a battle with me?

370
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:22,589
That'll be refreshing indeed!

371
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,669
I... I fear my father

372
00:19:25,669 --> 00:19:27,229
and the Big Madam won't approve.

373
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:29,509
When the time comes,

374
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:31,069
I will send an invitation to your house.

375
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,269
Your Main Mother will have to approve

376
00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:34,669
out of respect for me.

377
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:42,469
Miss!

378
00:19:52,949 --> 00:19:53,909
When you're outside your home,

379
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,629
as long as I am around,

380
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:56,749
no one is allowed to bully you!

381
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,149
Since I first met you,

382
00:19:58,349 --> 00:19:59,389
I loved that temperament of yours,

383
00:19:59,389 --> 00:20:00,669
not putting on artificial pretense.

384
00:20:00,669 --> 00:20:01,229
It's compatible with my temper.

385
00:20:01,229 --> 00:20:02,069
Big Madam.

386
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:04,469
The Sixth Young Master of your manor

387
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:05,469
is looking for you in the front courtyard.

388
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,269
Looking for me? For what?

389
00:20:07,629 --> 00:20:08,949
I only saw him,

390
00:20:08,949 --> 00:20:10,149
and I don't know

391
00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:10,789
why he's looking for you.

392
00:20:11,869 --> 00:20:13,349
It must be urgent.

393
00:20:13,349 --> 00:20:14,709
I won't stop you then.

394
00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:16,909
Alright then,

395
00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:18,069
but you must

396
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:19,509
come to the jiju match.

397
00:20:21,389 --> 00:20:22,749
Let me go first then.

398
00:20:25,109 --> 00:20:26,349
It must be that little whore whining

399
00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:27,769
about dying at home again.

400
00:20:27,829 --> 00:20:28,989
I will dispose her sooner or later!

401
00:20:41,229 --> 00:20:42,269
Sixth Miss.

402
00:20:45,989 --> 00:20:47,669
Sixth Miss, the Young Lord is here.

403
00:21:49,629 --> 00:21:51,069
A chef from Yangzhou

404
00:21:51,069 --> 00:21:51,829
joined my house recently.

405
00:21:52,949 --> 00:21:53,949
He makes

406
00:21:53,989 --> 00:21:54,909
the best thousand-layer cake.

407
00:21:55,709 --> 00:21:56,709
I hid a piece

408
00:21:56,749 --> 00:21:57,509
to bring to you.

409
00:22:07,189 --> 00:22:07,949
Come.

410
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:20,389
You try it.

411
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:22,749
See if the flavor is right.

412
00:22:35,829 --> 00:22:36,909
I know that,

413
00:22:37,509 --> 00:22:39,549
you are not usually fond of gold

414
00:22:39,549 --> 00:22:40,829
and silver accessories.

415
00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:43,789
powder and rouge, those sorts of things.

416
00:22:45,349 --> 00:22:47,509
But you are always

417
00:22:47,509 --> 00:22:48,749
most fond of eating.

418
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,775
So when there's food,

419
00:22:54,069 --> 00:22:55,069
I just think of

420
00:22:55,069 --> 00:22:56,069
bringing it to you.

421
00:22:58,749 --> 00:22:59,789
It's a bit cold, isn't it?

422
00:23:03,709 --> 00:23:04,709
It's a bit cold indeed.

423
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,269
This thousand-layer cake.

424
00:23:08,469 --> 00:23:09,669
It's better to eat it when it's hot.

425
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,109
Don't worry about me so much.

426
00:23:26,389 --> 00:23:28,469
Look at

427
00:23:28,469 --> 00:23:31,269
how you've grown thin and pale.

428
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:37,509
I...

429
00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:46,709
If I don't think of you,

430
00:23:50,989 --> 00:23:52,429
how can I bear through it?

431
00:24:01,829 --> 00:24:02,709
I know.

432
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:08,029
On the outside,

433
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,589
everyone's talking

434
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:12,009
about how I am going to marry

435
00:24:12,009 --> 00:24:13,029
this princess or that one.

436
00:24:16,229 --> 00:24:17,189
But don't worry.

437
00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:21,059
No matter if she's a state princess

438
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,029
or a city princess,

439
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:25,989
I will never marry anyone else as my wife.

440
00:24:28,069 --> 00:24:29,469
The wife that I, Qi Heng, will marry,

441
00:24:31,829 --> 00:24:33,429
is only you, Sheng Minglan.

442
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,229
Even if you never marry me,

443
00:24:51,469 --> 00:24:52,469
I will remember

444
00:24:52,469 --> 00:24:53,229
your look today.

445
00:25:05,349 --> 00:25:06,309
Don't worry.

446
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:09,749
If my mother doesn't consent,

447
00:25:12,509 --> 00:25:13,589
I will fight her with my life.

448
00:25:15,109 --> 00:25:17,549
I am the sole son of Qi House.

449
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:18,269
I don't believe

450
00:25:19,709 --> 00:25:20,269
I don't believe

451
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:21,149
she will watch me die.

452
00:25:22,339 --> 00:25:23,029
Stop that.

453
00:25:24,349 --> 00:25:25,909
You...

454
00:25:25,909 --> 00:25:27,269
no matter when,

455
00:25:27,389 --> 00:25:29,429
you can never seek your death.

456
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,229
If it's only for my sake...

457
00:25:33,429 --> 00:25:34,189
I...

458
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:37,949
I would rather never see you again

459
00:25:39,309 --> 00:25:40,229
than to see

460
00:25:40,229 --> 00:25:41,189
you harm yourself.

461
00:25:48,829 --> 00:25:49,429
Alright.

462
00:25:51,269 --> 00:25:51,829
Alright.

463
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:54,349
I-I will not

464
00:25:54,349 --> 00:25:55,189
mistreat my own body again.

465
00:25:56,669 --> 00:25:57,149
I…

466
00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:00,389
I've figured it out.

467
00:26:02,149 --> 00:26:03,189
In a few days,

468
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:06,909
hereditary noble houses like mine

469
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:07,754
will all enter the palace

470
00:26:07,754 --> 00:26:08,509
to attend the Spring Banquet.

471
00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:10,749
At that time,

472
00:26:10,749 --> 00:26:11,989
I will beg His Majesty right there and then,

473
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,629
beg him to appoint our marriage.

474
00:26:15,989 --> 00:26:17,589
No matter how fierce my mother is,

475
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,829
she won't dare to defy the Imperial edict.

476
00:26:20,589 --> 00:26:21,189
This...

477
00:26:23,469 --> 00:26:25,029
This...

478
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:25,509
is it...

479
00:26:26,629 --> 00:26:28,069
will that work?

480
00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:30,949
Yes, it will work.

481
00:26:32,269 --> 00:26:33,429
It must work.

482
00:26:34,949 --> 00:26:36,549
His Majesty,

483
00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:40,429
he is benevolent and kind.

484
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:42,789
He rejoices in granting wishes.

485
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:47,509
If I make my plea earnestly,

486
00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:48,709
there will be a result.

487
00:26:57,709 --> 00:26:58,549
Minglan?

488
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:04,189
Don't worry.

489
00:27:06,789 --> 00:27:08,269
You must take good care of yourself.

490
00:27:10,189 --> 00:27:11,309
You wait for me.

491
00:27:14,469 --> 00:27:15,549
I will not turn my back on you.

492
00:27:23,149 --> 00:27:24,549
If the Young Lord doesn't succeed...

493
00:27:26,989 --> 00:27:28,429
It never is something that could succeed.

494
00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:30,789
You should

495
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:32,069
talk to the Princess too.

496
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:35,149
If she sees how intelligent you are,

497
00:27:35,949 --> 00:27:37,309
and much better than that city princess,

498
00:27:37,309 --> 00:27:38,069
she will consent.

499
00:27:39,749 --> 00:27:40,549
No use.

500
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:44,989
How is it so hard?

501
00:27:45,469 --> 00:27:47,109
I just fear

502
00:27:47,109 --> 00:27:47,831
the Young Lord can't overcome

503
00:27:47,831 --> 00:27:48,389
the Princess' obstacles.

504
00:27:51,949 --> 00:27:53,949
If he gives up, I give up.

505
00:27:54,429 --> 00:27:57,469
If he proceeds forward, I will proceed forward.

506
00:27:58,789 --> 00:28:00,389
Your maidservant is right.

507
00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:03,509
Your Young Lord?

508
00:28:03,509 --> 00:28:04,949
I'm afraid he's going to collapse.

509
00:28:08,509 --> 00:28:09,429
Second Uncle Gu,

510
00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:10,189
how are you here?

511
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,109
I came home

512
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:14,589
to pick up something that belongs to me.

513
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:20,349
You...how long have you been here?

514
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,208
I just finished hearing the play,

515
00:28:23,208 --> 00:28:24,349
"The Palace of Eternal Life".

516
00:28:26,349 --> 00:28:27,789
Then you heard it all?

517
00:28:28,509 --> 00:28:30,749
Don't worry. I won't talk to others about it.

518
00:28:33,869 --> 00:28:36,029
Then you're still scoffing at me

519
00:28:36,029 --> 00:28:36,829
with Emperor Ming and Noble Consort Yang?

520
00:28:37,389 --> 00:28:38,909
What I said though was

521
00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:41,349
that a different story bears the same logic.

522
00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:44,789
Back then, Emperor Ming and Consort Yang

523
00:28:45,589 --> 00:28:47,021
swore their love to each other

524
00:28:47,021 --> 00:28:48,389
and were so full of passion.

525
00:28:48,909 --> 00:28:50,469
But in the end,

526
00:28:50,469 --> 00:28:52,789
Emperor Ming still abandoned Noble Consort Yang,

527
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:54,269
in order to preserve

528
00:28:54,269 --> 00:28:56,029
his own life and his nation.

529
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,709
He's not Emperor Ming,

530
00:28:58,709 --> 00:29:00,069
so what nation does he need to preserve?

531
00:29:01,589 --> 00:29:03,029
He's got no nation of his own.

532
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,029
But he shoulders the honor

533
00:29:06,029 --> 00:29:07,509
and shame of the entire Qi family.

534
00:29:08,989 --> 00:29:10,429
Young Lord himself,

535
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:13,349
he's brimming with talent indeed,

536
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:15,949
and friendly and amiable.

537
00:29:15,949 --> 00:29:16,869
He's a good person.

538
00:29:17,949 --> 00:29:20,589
However, he can't carry

539
00:29:21,549 --> 00:29:22,549
such a grand task.

540
00:29:24,509 --> 00:29:25,389
I fear that at the time,

541
00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:26,789
you'll be in a lot of pain from the fall.

542
00:29:30,909 --> 00:29:31,589
I see then that you claim you don't care,

543
00:29:31,589 --> 00:29:33,349
Second Uncle.

544
00:29:33,629 --> 00:29:34,349
But in your mind,

545
00:29:34,349 --> 00:29:35,429
you've always carried a grudge against me,

546
00:29:35,789 --> 00:29:36,509
begrudging me for messing up you

547
00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:37,909
and Sister Yanran's marriage match?

548
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:42,509
Second Uncle Gu, you're a good person,

549
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,189
but you can't help but to speak with thorns.

550
00:29:46,069 --> 00:29:46,989
Second Young Master.

551
00:29:50,349 --> 00:29:52,149
They are here to capture me,

552
00:29:52,149 --> 00:29:53,189
so you should hurry and run.

553
00:29:54,109 --> 00:29:54,909
You…!

554
00:29:55,789 --> 00:29:57,229
They are here to capture you?

555
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:58,149
Then are you alright?

556
00:29:58,829 --> 00:29:59,629
This is my home,

557
00:29:59,629 --> 00:30:00,732
so what's not alright about it?

558
00:30:02,389 --> 00:30:04,869
I...maybe

559
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:06,829
I can help by holding that spear for you?

560
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:09,509
No need, I think.

561
00:30:09,509 --> 00:30:11,429
I won't trouble you, Sixth Miss, with my business.

562
00:30:12,909 --> 00:30:13,749
Hurry and go now.

563
00:30:15,269 --> 00:30:15,989
Let's go.

564
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,589
Second Young Master, don't make it hard for us.

565
00:30:30,229 --> 00:30:31,389
Second Young Master.

566
00:30:32,229 --> 00:30:33,309
What?

567
00:30:34,029 --> 00:30:35,149
We haven't seen each other for just a short time,

568
00:30:35,149 --> 00:30:36,109
and you already are treating me as a criminal?

569
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:38,029
Let me tell you all that

570
00:30:38,029 --> 00:30:39,709
even if I've left the House of Gu,

571
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:42,149
my name

572
00:30:42,149 --> 00:30:43,469
is still in the genealogy book!

573
00:30:43,629 --> 00:30:45,229
The Gu Clan doesn't have a descendant like you!

574
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,229
You still have the nerve to come back?

575
00:30:51,709 --> 00:30:54,149
I'm taking this spear placed in the ancestral temple.

576
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:56,789
You're already not a person of the House of Gu.

577
00:30:57,549 --> 00:30:59,109
Don't even think of taking the items

578
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:00,229
inside the ancestral temple.

579
00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:04,335
When I was eight years old,

580
00:31:04,349 --> 00:31:05,352
I went into the palace to meet

581
00:31:05,352 --> 00:31:06,109
the Emperor with Father.

582
00:31:06,469 --> 00:31:08,149
At that time,

583
00:31:08,149 --> 00:31:08,989
I did a spear dance in front of the Emperor.

584
00:31:10,589 --> 00:31:11,629
His Majesty was so happy

585
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,149
that he bestowed this spear to the House of Gu.

586
00:31:15,429 --> 00:31:17,709
Without me, there wouldn't be this spear.

587
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,989
Why can't I take it with me?

588
00:31:20,149 --> 00:31:21,189
Also,

589
00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:23,789
I don't have anything that

590
00:31:23,789 --> 00:31:24,869
I want with the House of Gu anymore.

591
00:31:25,189 --> 00:31:26,109
I earned

592
00:31:26,109 --> 00:31:26,989
this spear myself,

593
00:31:27,229 --> 00:31:28,029
hence, I'm taking it away.

594
00:31:29,629 --> 00:31:31,989
Since it was placed inside the ancestral temple,

595
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:33,909
then it's the possession of the House of Gu!

596
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:39,029
Don't even think of

597
00:31:39,069 --> 00:31:40,029
taking anything

598
00:31:40,029 --> 00:31:41,109
from the House of Gu!

599
00:31:41,509 --> 00:31:42,050
You...You..!

600
00:31:44,309 --> 00:31:45,709
Just with the few of you...

601
00:31:48,149 --> 00:31:49,309
You think you can stop me?

602
00:31:51,669 --> 00:31:52,829
If you aren't afraid to be branded

603
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:53,709
as the killer of your older brother,

604
00:31:55,029 --> 00:31:56,349
just walk over my dead body

605
00:31:56,349 --> 00:31:57,429
and you can have this!

606
00:31:57,669 --> 00:31:58,429
You!

607
00:32:00,149 --> 00:32:01,069
You...

608
00:32:04,429 --> 00:32:04,925
Fine.

609
00:32:06,389 --> 00:32:07,509
I won't hit you today,

610
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:10,029
so you won't get the chance to

611
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:10,909
put another act in front of everyone.

612
00:32:13,589 --> 00:32:15,789
I'll give you this spear.

613
00:32:18,669 --> 00:32:20,429
You can put it in the main receiving hall

614
00:32:20,699 --> 00:32:22,189
or in the ancestral temple.

615
00:32:22,189 --> 00:32:23,189
But remember this.

616
00:32:23,949 --> 00:32:24,989
One day,

617
00:32:24,989 --> 00:32:25,909
I'm coming back.

618
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:27,831
You'll be forced to open

619
00:32:27,831 --> 00:32:28,709
the main middle gates for me

620
00:32:28,709 --> 00:32:29,549
and sweep the courtyard for me.

621
00:32:29,709 --> 00:32:30,909
You will be inviting me inside the ancestral temple

622
00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:32,389
and handing me this spear with both hands!

623
00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:38,829
Dream on!

624
00:32:54,109 --> 00:32:56,149
Was it you who was being the bridge

625
00:32:56,149 --> 00:32:57,749
between your Young Master

626
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:59,029
and that illegitimate Sheng daughter,

627
00:32:59,069 --> 00:33:00,029
and thus they were able to meet?

628
00:33:00,669 --> 00:33:02,629
No. No.

629
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:03,949
You still dare to deny it!

630
00:33:05,029 --> 00:33:06,869
If you don't admit it,

631
00:33:06,869 --> 00:33:08,029
I'll beat you up until you die!

632
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:09,584
I really didn't.

633
00:33:09,584 --> 00:33:10,829
May Big Madam investigate it wisely.

634
00:33:11,989 --> 00:33:14,829
Fine, if you won't say it.

635
00:33:15,909 --> 00:33:17,789
It's not important

636
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:19,949
if it's you or not.

637
00:33:20,469 --> 00:33:22,189
Either way,

638
00:33:22,189 --> 00:33:23,389
today I'm going to cane you to death!

639
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:24,709
Hit him!

640
00:33:27,509 --> 00:33:29,469
Your Highness! Your Highness!

641
00:33:29,469 --> 00:33:30,509
Please spare my life!

642
00:33:30,829 --> 00:33:32,909
Young Lord!

643
00:33:38,189 --> 00:33:41,229
Young Lord!

644
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:44,669
Mother. Mother.

645
00:33:45,469 --> 00:33:46,229
What are you doing?

646
00:33:46,429 --> 00:33:47,469
What did Buwei do wrong?

647
00:33:47,789 --> 00:33:48,629
He refused to

648
00:33:49,509 --> 00:33:51,909
admit that he devised means for you

649
00:33:51,909 --> 00:33:52,749
and that Sheng girl to privately meet behind my back.

650
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:54,629
If he won't admit it, I'll beat him to death!

651
00:33:55,549 --> 00:33:57,669
he didn't.

652
00:33:57,669 --> 00:33:58,749
I didn't have any private meetings with anyone.

653
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:01,069
Buwei didn't help me

654
00:34:01,069 --> 00:34:01,589
have a private date with anyone!

655
00:34:02,669 --> 00:34:04,189
Mother, I beg you,

656
00:34:04,189 --> 00:34:05,229
please spare Buwei.

657
00:34:05,429 --> 00:34:06,909
Mother, I beg you! Mother!

658
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:09,509
Are you all treating me as if I am dead or blind?

659
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:12,029
Doing tricks right under the eyes of

660
00:34:12,029 --> 00:34:13,589
the House of Prince Yong!

661
00:34:14,069 --> 00:34:15,629
If Princess Consort Yong learns of this,

662
00:34:15,629 --> 00:34:16,629
do you know what great trouble will that be?

663
00:34:18,029 --> 00:34:19,269
If I don't kill him today,

664
00:34:19,749 --> 00:34:21,989
the servants in this house

665
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:23,029
will imitate him

666
00:34:23,229 --> 00:34:25,109
and help you rebel against your parents!

667
00:34:25,789 --> 00:34:27,029
Won't this house get turned upside down then?

668
00:34:28,549 --> 00:34:29,429
Beat him to death!

669
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:39,029
Mother, I beg you.

670
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:41,869
I beg you to spare Buwei. Mother.

671
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:43,269
Mother!

672
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,549
Informing Big Madam, Buwei is dead.

673
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:13,949
Buwei...

674
00:35:15,749 --> 00:35:17,789
Buwei. Buwei!

675
00:36:02,989 --> 00:36:03,669
Buwei...

676
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:05,949
Buwei...

677
00:36:07,509 --> 00:36:08,189
Buwei!

678
00:36:27,949 --> 00:36:29,509
You're already this ill.

679
00:36:29,509 --> 00:36:30,669
Where else do you want to go?

680
00:36:32,229 --> 00:36:33,949
I can't stay here in this house anymore.

681
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:37,309
I'm going to die of suffocation.

682
00:36:41,549 --> 00:36:42,509
You don't want your parents anymore?

683
00:36:48,189 --> 00:36:49,189
Buwei...

684
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:53,349
was my most trusted aide.

685
00:36:55,269 --> 00:36:56,189
He respected me.

686
00:36:57,829 --> 00:36:58,829
He loved me.

687
00:37:00,349 --> 00:37:01,509
He cared about me.

688
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:05,029
He pitied me.

689
00:37:05,029 --> 00:37:05,949
You killed him.

690
00:37:08,029 --> 00:37:10,669
That's also killing...

691
00:37:10,669 --> 00:37:11,749
my heart.

692
00:37:13,629 --> 00:37:14,589
No.

693
00:37:15,189 --> 00:37:15,869
I...

694
00:37:16,989 --> 00:37:18,229
I can't just sit here and wait for death.

695
00:37:19,349 --> 00:37:20,050
If you all won't

696
00:37:20,109 --> 00:37:21,109
let me be with Minglan,

697
00:37:21,109 --> 00:37:22,309
I insist on being with her!

698
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,029
Right now,

699
00:37:24,029 --> 00:37:25,109
I'll go to the Sheng Manor to propose marriage.

700
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:27,549
Yuanruo.

701
00:37:29,029 --> 00:37:29,829
Yuanruo!

702
00:37:30,709 --> 00:37:31,949
If you go,

703
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:34,149
you're going to kill me and your father!

704
00:37:50,389 --> 00:37:51,509
Yuanruo...

705
00:37:54,309 --> 00:37:57,589
Do you know why Rong Feiyan died?

706
00:38:02,829 --> 00:38:04,869
It was all because of you.

707
00:38:11,189 --> 00:38:12,189
The Rong Family

708
00:38:14,069 --> 00:38:15,025
was the first one with intentions

709
00:38:15,025 --> 00:38:16,149
to be connected with us through marriage.

710
00:38:17,989 --> 00:38:19,329
Imperial Consort Rong had already

711
00:38:19,329 --> 00:38:20,549
called me into the palace twice.

712
00:38:22,069 --> 00:38:23,549
She also told me

713
00:38:23,549 --> 00:38:25,469
about it openly and covertly.

714
00:38:27,509 --> 00:38:29,069
The ancestors of

715
00:38:29,069 --> 00:38:30,869
the House of Rong were just masons.

716
00:38:31,189 --> 00:38:33,029
Their family isn't really that prestigious.

717
00:38:34,189 --> 00:38:35,909
I wasn't willing,

718
00:38:35,909 --> 00:38:37,629
but I couldn't rashly reject them.

719
00:38:38,189 --> 00:38:39,509
I could only delay it.

720
00:38:41,829 --> 00:38:43,789
Afterwards,

721
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:45,829
during the jiju match outside Jinming Reservoir,

722
00:38:47,229 --> 00:38:49,109
Princess Jiacheng, the daughter of Prince Yong,

723
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,989
fell in love with you at first sight.

724
00:38:51,989 --> 00:38:53,339
She begged her parents to marry you

725
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:54,149
upon returning home.

726
00:38:57,029 --> 00:39:00,109
Although Prince Yong has a lot of sons,

727
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:01,989
he only has this one daughter.

728
00:39:02,469 --> 00:39:03,294
Since she was little,

729
00:39:03,294 --> 00:39:04,549
he treated her as a precious pearl

730
00:39:04,589 --> 00:39:05,829
and gave her everything she asked for.

731
00:39:06,269 --> 00:39:07,629
A few days ago,

732
00:39:08,789 --> 00:39:12,269
Princess Consort Yong came to test the waters.

733
00:39:14,549 --> 00:39:16,669
I was put in a difficult place

734
00:39:16,669 --> 00:39:18,749
for I can't offend both families.

735
00:39:19,789 --> 00:39:22,029
I could only tell her the truth.

736
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:23,109
Never thought...

737
00:39:25,069 --> 00:39:27,109
that Princess Consort Yong

738
00:39:27,109 --> 00:39:28,469
didn't say anything in front of me,

739
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:30,869
but during the Spring Lantern Festival,

740
00:39:32,509 --> 00:39:33,909
that incident with...

741
00:39:35,189 --> 00:39:37,189
Rong Feiyan happened.

742
00:39:41,149 --> 00:39:41,909
It was...

743
00:39:42,709 --> 00:39:44,029
done by the Royal House of Prince Yong?

744
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:46,149
Imperial Consort Rong

745
00:39:47,549 --> 00:39:49,549
doted on her little sister the most.

746
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:53,709
With Imperial Consort Rong being so highly-favored,

747
00:39:54,109 --> 00:39:55,109
His Majesty even sent out

748
00:39:55,109 --> 00:39:57,189
the Yulin Imperial Army,

749
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,069
but they were unable to find

750
00:39:58,069 --> 00:40:00,229
even the shadow of the criminals.

751
00:40:01,069 --> 00:40:02,349
Other than Prince Yong,

752
00:40:03,909 --> 00:40:04,909
who else

753
00:40:06,349 --> 00:40:08,589
can do it without leaving any traces behind?

754
00:40:12,789 --> 00:40:14,028
They are acting without regard for the law

755
00:40:14,028 --> 00:40:14,709
and of natural morality.

756
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:15,949
Then is His Majesty

757
00:40:15,949 --> 00:40:17,389
just going to sit by and do nothing?

758
00:40:21,229 --> 00:40:24,029
Because of the Crown Prince matter,

759
00:40:24,029 --> 00:40:25,229
His Majesty has already become ill from depression.

760
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,141
He didn't attend the morning court

761
00:40:27,141 --> 00:40:27,829
for more than a month.

762
00:40:29,029 --> 00:40:31,069
To prevent him from being more anxious,

763
00:40:31,069 --> 00:40:32,149
the whole inner palace

764
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,509
dare not tell him about this.

765
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:38,109
Prince Yong is of the highest noble background.

766
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,069
He has so many descendants

767
00:40:40,429 --> 00:40:41,909
and is the eldest

768
00:40:41,909 --> 00:40:44,029
among the royal relatives.

769
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:45,389
The most popular among them.

770
00:40:46,789 --> 00:40:48,989
If he becomes the Crown Prince,

771
00:40:49,749 --> 00:40:52,389
he will become more powerful.

772
00:40:52,389 --> 00:40:54,189
We can't offend him.

773
00:40:56,269 --> 00:40:57,789
He's still not the Crown Prince now.

774
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:59,509
No matter if he is,

775
00:41:00,309 --> 00:41:01,189
he's a person

776
00:41:01,189 --> 00:41:02,389
that's above us.

777
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,469
Moreover,

778
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:06,589
because of the incident with Rong Feiyan,

779
00:41:07,629 --> 00:41:08,669
the family of Imperial Consort Rong

780
00:41:09,749 --> 00:41:11,509
also developed hatred towards us.

781
00:41:12,749 --> 00:41:15,309
Our Qi Clan doesn't have abundant descendants.

782
00:41:16,669 --> 00:41:18,085
Our relatives aren't that successful

783
00:41:18,085 --> 00:41:18,749
in their careers.

784
00:41:18,749 --> 00:41:20,429
We're the only ones supporting the clan.

785
00:41:21,309 --> 00:41:22,309
Even though your father

786
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:23,349
used to be in charge of the salt trade,

787
00:41:24,989 --> 00:41:26,549
he doesn't have

788
00:41:26,549 --> 00:41:27,949
that post now.

789
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:29,709
His is just has an empty post

790
00:41:29,749 --> 00:41:31,589
and isn't highly-favored by His Majesty.

791
00:41:32,669 --> 00:41:34,029
These past years

792
00:41:34,029 --> 00:41:35,229
it's all because I

793
00:41:35,819 --> 00:41:37,869
grew up beside His Majesty and Empress,

794
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:39,229
hence, they showed us some graces

795
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,669
and preserved the flourishing of

796
00:41:41,669 --> 00:41:43,269
the ducal manor these past ten years.

797
00:41:45,429 --> 00:41:46,869
If you don't agree with this marriage,

798
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:48,989
and one day

799
00:41:49,989 --> 00:41:51,109
His Majesty is gone

800
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:53,469
and the new Emperor ascends to the throne,

801
00:41:55,269 --> 00:41:56,269
at that time,

802
00:41:57,709 --> 00:41:59,069
the world will turn upside down

803
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:02,949
and we'll have lost a backer!

804
00:42:05,229 --> 00:42:06,429
When that time comes,

805
00:42:08,629 --> 00:42:09,069
we...

806
00:42:10,709 --> 00:42:11,709
will really become

807
00:42:11,709 --> 00:42:13,269
meat on the chopping board,

808
00:42:14,989 --> 00:42:16,310
with which Prince Yong can do anything

809
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:16,829
to as he wishes.

810
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:26,269
Such a joke.

811
00:42:28,989 --> 00:42:29,909
People would talk about...

812
00:42:32,109 --> 00:42:33,549
Baosi and Daji

813
00:42:35,509 --> 00:42:38,149
Now,

814
00:42:38,149 --> 00:42:40,389
I'm just a crude lad

815
00:42:41,549 --> 00:42:43,749
but is able to

816
00:42:43,749 --> 00:42:45,269
induce this huge catastrophe.

817
00:42:48,269 --> 00:42:49,109
Mother,

818
00:42:52,475 --> 00:42:53,749
if I die,

819
00:42:55,749 --> 00:42:56,629
Prince Yong will spare our family,

820
00:42:56,629 --> 00:42:57,509
right?

821
00:43:01,269 --> 00:43:02,389
Are you crazy?

822
00:43:03,229 --> 00:43:05,149
What silly words are you saying?

823
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:06,029
I'm not crazy.

824
00:43:07,509 --> 00:43:09,189
This is the only way

825
00:43:09,189 --> 00:43:10,429
to save the Qi Family.

826
00:43:11,269 --> 00:43:12,789
Mother,

827
00:43:12,789 --> 00:43:14,469
go and give a reply to Princess Consort Yong now.

828
00:43:15,149 --> 00:43:16,109
If she wants me,

829
00:43:16,749 --> 00:43:17,509
sure,

830
00:43:18,709 --> 00:43:20,029
as long as

831
00:43:20,029 --> 00:43:21,029
the Princess

832
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:24,069
is willing to marry a corpse.

833
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:26,629
No!

834
00:43:27,869 --> 00:43:29,309
You are the only descendant of our Qi family.

835
00:43:29,749 --> 00:43:31,709
You're are our only son.

836
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:32,549
You can't die!

837
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:35,669
If you don't want to go, Mother...

838
00:43:37,989 --> 00:43:39,050
I'll personally write the letter

839
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:39,749
and send it to them.

840
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:42,709
Princess! The Duke's

841
00:43:42,709 --> 00:43:44,069
carriage is back!

842
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:46,789
So he has come back then

843
00:43:46,789 --> 00:43:47,709
why are you be panicking?

844
00:43:48,309 --> 00:43:50,429
The carriage is back, but the person isn't!
