00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,925
Episode 64

3
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,920
It'd be better if I just die!

4
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,600
Mother.

5
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,000
Let me die!

6
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,080
Miss.

7
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,417
Let me die

8
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,800
My Big Madam has momentarily gone crazy.

9
00:01:17,417 --> 00:01:18,120
Why don't you let me take her back home

10
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,000
for a while

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,400
and we'll just return later.

12
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,600
I'm not going.

13
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,360
Let's go back.

14
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,720
Nanny Qi, you can't go!

15
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,800
Nanny Qi,

16
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,120
we both are serving different masters!

17
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,040
Mother!

18
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:28,760
Your Big Madam

19
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,880
framed my Big Madam!

20
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,400
You're just going to leave like this?

21
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,440
You can't go!

22
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,200
Stop right there!

23
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,760
Stop right there!

24
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,840
Stop!

25
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,600
Go away.

26
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,840
Virtuous son-in-law

27
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,120
your wife's older sister has become confused.

28
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,200
I admit her mistakes.

29
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,240
I agree that she must be punished.

30
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,680
But with her seeking death like this,

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,520
being so loud like this,

32
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,200
we won't be able to discuss anything.

33
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,160
Why don't we just let her leave first?

34
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,240
For the other things,

35
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,360
let us sane people talk about it.

36
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,720
Since mother-in-law has acknowledged it,

37
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,280
then

38
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,040
No.

39
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,040
Sixth Miss, if you want to say anything,

40
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,920
you can also stay with us to discuss it.

41
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,160
You've repeatedly contradicted your elders.

42
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,400
You can't be so rude.

43
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,680
It's not that I'm being rude.

44
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,680
I'm just worried

45
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,040
that if we let Maternal Aunt leave,

46
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,160
then what if

47
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,800
she escapes?

48
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,600
What do you mean by escaping?

49
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,200
You think our House of Wang

50
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,400
is the market thief?

51
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,960
We all are illustrious families.

52
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,800
We all care about our reputation.

53
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,520
That's right.

54
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,240
It's hard to say.

55
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,200
She's able to do a lowly thing as poisoning.

56
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,640
What else can't she do?

57
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,720
If she really escapes,

58
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,080
must our Sheng Family

59
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,200
still post wanted posters

60
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,040
all over the streets?

61
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,200
That is what you call embarrassing oneself up

62
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,320
to the streets.

63
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,640
Virtuous son-in-law,

64
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,520
your daughter

65
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,560
is really well-mannered.

66
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,560
So aggressive towards her elders.

67
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,600
Even if I am at this age,

68
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,600
she still has so many words waiting for me.

69
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,080
Since my wife's sister isn't feeling well,

70
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,320
there are still a lot of guest rooms in my house.

71
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,240
Let her rest in our manor

72
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,200
for a while then.

73
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,440
My mother is still unconscious.

74
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,240
If we let the suspect easily leave like that,

75
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,640
am I worthy of being a son?!

76
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,800
Leave first.

77
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,400
I will discuss the rest.

78
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,880
I'm not going!

79
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,680
I'm not going anywhere!

80
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,680
You all want to see my death!

81
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,800
Sheng Family wants to use my life

82
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,440
to pay for their Old Madam's life!

83
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,320
Mother!

84
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,120
You are so ruthless!

85
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,440
You are stepping on your own flesh and blood to curry flavor with others,

86
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,240
to climb to a higher branch.

87
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,960
Sister-in-law, just go first.

88
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,200
We'll negotiate this.

89
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,080
Those Sheng father and daughter,

90
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,040
one says the ruthless words

91
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,880
while the other says the soft words!

92
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,200
They won't let me off!

93
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,640
Mother!

94
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,680
Can't you pity your own daughter?!

95
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,480
Let go of me!

96
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,800
Let go of me!

97
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,760
Mother!

98
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,600
We will save you.

99
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,040
Let go of me!

100
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,520
Mother!

101
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,000
Mother!

102
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,040
Virtuous son-in-law.

103
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,680
You mustn't do this.

104
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,320
I can't bear such bow!

105
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,960
When you came to our house that year

106
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,320
I immediately liked you upon seeing you.

107
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,280
A lot of people advised me

108
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,027
that your family was frail

109
00:05:17,027 --> 00:05:18,760
and not worthy to be entrusted upon.

110
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,560
But I felt that you had a precious character

111
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,680
capable and experienced.

112
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,280
Way better than my son.

113
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,120
Afterwards, you proposed marriage.

114
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,440
I was so happy

115
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,600
and immediately agreed to it.

116
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,549
A lot of people said that my daughter

117
00:05:39,549 --> 00:05:41,280
married to a lower status family.

118
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,120
But I felt that

119
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,240
based on your personality and talent,

120
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,960
you were the one who lowered your standard

121
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,640
to marry my muddled daughter.

122
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,640
It's all thanks to mother-in-law for promoting me

123
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,800
that I was able to have

124
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,220
my current official achievements.

125
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,280
I will never forget

126
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,400
your kindness to me.

127
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,320
Good child.

128
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,640
Right now, my heart is full of remorse.

129
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,840
I am ashamed to face you,

130
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,440
or stand in front of you.

131
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,960
I really want to kneel to you!

132
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,720
Mother-in-law,

133
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,720
you're saying it too seriously.

134
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,640
Quickly sit down.

135
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,800
No.

136
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,000
Do I still have the face to sit down?

137
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,680
Although your mother and I

138
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,360
weren't together

139
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,520
for a long time,

140
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,960
I'm very impressed

141
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,240
by her character.

142
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,320
When I heard that she has suffered,

143
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,840
I wanted so much to suffer in place of her.

144
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,440
Your mother is a very benevolent person.

145
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,360
I'm sure she also won't be willing for this matter

146
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,029
to cause our three families to turn hostile

147
00:06:58,029 --> 00:06:59,680
against each other from now on.

148
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,120
Relatives not acting as relatives.

149
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,080
Blood kin becoming enemies.

150
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,240
All our three families are famous

151
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,200
in the political arena.

152
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,520
If we walk forward hand in hand,

153
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,360
we all surely will have a bright future.

154
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,680
If we separate and get divided,

155
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,720
a lot of people who hate us

156
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,240
will surely try to push the toppling wall further,

157
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,560
my virtuous son-in-law.

158
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,760
Old Madam Wang,

159
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,120
only after hearing you say these past events today

160
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,160
did I know

161
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,560
how our Sheng Family owed you

162
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,280
a debt of gratitude.

163
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,440
It was you

164
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,280
who raised my father to adulthood,

165
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,200
inviting a famous teacher to guide him,

166
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,600
teaching him so that he was able to pass the civil examination,

167
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,200
finding him a wife and eventually having children

168
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,400
propagating our ancestral line.

169
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,560
What nonsense are you saying?

170
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,680
It was clearly my legitimate mother

171
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,720
who raised me.

172
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,200
That's right.

173
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:00,920
Since it was grandmother

174
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,800
who raised you,

175
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,320
you also should

176
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,320
thank her.

177
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,440
How could I not know that

178
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,640
I owe mother-in-law a lot for your kindness?

179
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:18,040
But in terms of familial law,

180
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,560
there's no way that I will let off the person

181
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,360
who tried to harm my legitimate mother.

182
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,880
Hope mother-in-law can understand and forgive me.

183
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,960
Virtuous son-in-law, good child,

184
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,320
those two muddled women

185
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,560
indeed committed a grave mistake.

186
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,040
Just for the sake

187
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,240
of me

188
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,240
and your deceased father-in-law's honor,

189
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,880
please be a bit merciful.

190
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,720
From then on,

191
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,080
my whole family will be vegetarians, will fast,

192
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,280
light temple lanterns and pray to Buddha, bow to the deities,

193
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,520
and chant sutras and pray for blessings for your mother.

194
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,120
Our whole Sheng family is grateful

195
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,880
to my grandmother for her deep kindness and great virtue.

196
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,568
Our whole family are being vegetarians,

197
00:09:05,568 --> 00:09:06,800
fasting, praying to Buddha

198
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,320
But you also saw

199
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,640
that before Maternal Aunt left earlier,

200
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,320
her mouth was full of hatred and sinister intentions.

201
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,080
Who knows what she'll ask

202
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,800
when she

203
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,480
goes to the temple?

204
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,725
It's already not bad

205
00:09:21,725 --> 00:09:22,800
if she won't be cursing our Sheng's.

206
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,240
Indeed.

207
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,520
How could a person who hasn't paid for her sins

208
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,360
be worthy to attend to the deities

209
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,720
and clean up the altar of Buddha?

210
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,720
Tell us then,

211
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,800
how should she be dealt with?

212
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,320
Say it.

213
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,685
If you owe money, you must pay it back.

214
00:09:56,685 --> 00:09:58,360
If you kill someone, you must pay with your life.

215
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,840
What? This...

216
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,280
You...

217
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,840
Sixth Miss.

218
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,000
You are now

219
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,080
pregnant.

220
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,280
Even if it's just to accumulate good karma,

221
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,920
you should be more forgiving to others.

222
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,440
Moreover,

223
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,920
even if that little sister of mine

224
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,160
dies several hundred times,

225
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,280
I fear that your grandmother

226
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,160
won't still recover that easily.

227
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,440
Why can't you just be merciful

228
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,560
and why do you insist on

229
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,440
harming everyone's dignity?

230
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,000
Father,

231
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,920
what do you think?

232
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,480
If the case regarding my mother

233
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,640
being poisoned gets out,

234
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,920
it will only be a scandal for the Sheng Family,

235
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,600
the Kang Family, and the Wang Family.

236
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,800
But the effect on each one will actually be different.

237
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,200
You finally realized it.

238
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,680
Our Sheng Family is the victim.

239
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,360
At most,

240
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,920
it will just be my legitimate wife

241
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,200
inviting a wolf into our house,

242
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,600
ending up with the reputation

243
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,200
of committing a muddled oversight,

244
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,880
and have others mock at her for two years.

245
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,800
The Kang Family is the in-law

246
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,960
of that sister of my wife.

247
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,880
They will suffer the brute of the trouble.

248
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,320
But we all know

249
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,360
that Lord Kang

250
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,640
and that sister-in-law of mine

251
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,880
aren't really that deeply affectionate with each other.

252
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,920
If it will require to break his tail just to survive,

253
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,240
just one divorce letter

254
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,200
and he'll be able to expel

255
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,240
that sister-in-law of mine out of his house,

256
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,514
and the Kang Family will then be able to

257
00:11:43,514 --> 00:11:44,320
eliminate their connection to this matter.

258
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,000
Am I right, my nephew?

259
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,200
My father will never do that.

260
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,320
My mother is the legal wife.

261
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,660
My father will never do such a thing!

262
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,760
Why then did he not come?

263
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,400
He

264
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,200
Trying to kill an elderly relative is a grave crime!

265
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,800
The one who committed the biggest mistake will be the Wang's.

266
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,880
Mother-in-law,

267
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,160
you better think about it clearly.

268
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,080
Nonsense!

269
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,640
The two women involved in this case

270
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,360
are members of the Sheng

271
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,440
and Kang families.

272
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,120
How is our Wang family involved in this?

273
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,400
Lord Sheng,

274
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,120
just to clear yourself

275
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,080
from this,

276
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,600
But the two of them both have Wang surnames.

277
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,680
They are both your flesh and blood.

278
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,720
Your two daughters are involved in this crime.

279
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,880
One implemented it in a confused state.

280
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,320
The other is the mastermind who planned it.

281
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,400
If this gets out,

282
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,000
what will happen to the political career

283
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,720
of the Wang father and son?

284
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,520
Maybe

285
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,040
even your special privilege of having your memorial tablet

286
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,920
placed in the imperial ancestral hall would be removed.

287
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,680
Maternal Auntie-in-law,

288
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,640
those two daughters of yours,

289
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,160
one still undergoing marriage talks,

290
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,040
while the other one already married off,

291
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,520
what will happen in their future life?

292
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,400
Have you thought about that?

293
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,160
You said it right.

294
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,720
This matter wasn't a mistake of our Sheng Clan.

295
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,680
Why must we endure

296
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,420
the humiliation and keep silent?

297
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,720
In my opinion,

298
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,200
just execute that sinister woman

299
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,360
to uphold the family and state laws.

300
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,440
From then on,

301
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,920
our three families will cover this whole thing up.

302
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,520
Afterwards,

303
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,680
it will be peaceful.

304
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,680
Mother, why not

305
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,720
Shut up!

306
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,520
Lord Sheng,

307
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,760
you thought about it so thoroughly.

308
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,440
What if I refuse?

309
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,920
I'm also very exhausted.

310
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,760
If mother-in-law can't understand it,

311
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,080
then let's just report it

312
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,920
to the authority.

313
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,200
My daughter is just

314
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,400
your family's sister-in-law.

315
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,360
At most, she'll just get exiled.

316
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,560
If our family would handsomely take care of it

317
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,720
she surely will get a lighter sentence.

318
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,840
Don't forget.

319
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,640
Your main wife

320
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,920
was also part in harming her mother-in-law.

321
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,560
What crime will she get sentenced with?

322
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,680
Once she is sentenced,

323
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,160
her son and daughters

324
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,640
Oh, right,

325
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,520
they are also your son and daughters.

326
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,720
What will happen to these people?

327
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,400
You clearly know about it.

328
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,600
Mother,

329
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,040
just to save older sister,

330
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,960
you want me to die?

331
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,680
Son-in-law, you are a scholarly official

332
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,920
so you know the law very well.

333
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,720
What punishment will a daughter-in-law

334
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,040
attempting to kill her mother-in-law receive?

335
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,840
Can Changbai and Changfeng

336
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,425
still be able to progress

337
00:15:10,425 --> 00:15:11,280
in their political career from then on?

338
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,440
What kind of life will Rulan and Hualan

339
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,630
have in their in-laws?

340
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,120
Have you thought about all these?

341
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,720
So, you really didn't love me.

342
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,400
Big Madam, let's go rest!

343
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,600
Big Madam.

344
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,240
Big Madam.

345
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,840
Old Madam is just competing with Master

346
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,080
on who is more ruthless.

347
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,920
How could she not really dote you?

348
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,440
Using me to compete?

349
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,680
She has harmed me to this point,

350
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,280
and she still is using me to compete?

351
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,600
If she can be saved, then both sides can benefit.

352
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,240
I've long felt that

353
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,200
mother doesn't really love me.

354
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,120
So, it's all true.

355
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,040
She really doesn't love me.

356
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,640
She doesn't really love me.

357
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,920
Virtuous son-in-law,

358
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,200
this is a muddled debt to begin with.

359
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,320
Your mother is a blessed person.

360
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,640
She surely will survive this danger.

361
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,840
This matter is only known

362
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,040
by the few people in this room.

363
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,400
Once your mother wakes up

364
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,880
there's no need to tell her too,

365
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,880
so she won't get saddened by it

366
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,040
for it might worsen her illness.

367
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,160
When we go back,

368
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,720
I surely will heavily punish my daughter.

369
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,840
Tell your wife to stay filial

370
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,720
to your mother-in-law.

371
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,160
From now on,

372
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,440
we still are one harmonious family.

373
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,080
We still need to help each other in the political arena.

374
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,280
Miss,

375
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,720
you still are pregnant.

376
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,240
Don't tire yourself anymore

377
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,720
for such a grave matter.

378
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,480
Go down and rest now.

379
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,400
You want to drive me away?

380
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,920
Let me tell you,

381
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,560
no way!

382
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,480
I know that you're filial.

383
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,360
You want to seek justice for your grandmother.

384
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,920
Big Madam didn't raise you,

385
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,800
so you don't have much affection for her.

386
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,320
But were your eldest sister

387
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,760
and second brother bad to you?

388
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,880
I,

389
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,480
If not thinking of them,

390
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,080
I've hacked that sinister woman

391
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,009
to death already!

392
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,840
Will you still have the chance to talk here?

393
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,200
That's right, child.

394
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,320
I just knew that you care about

395
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,480
your sisters and brother.

396
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,880
They are your

397
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,400
flesh and blood.

398
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,080
Not only them,

399
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,840
Changbai's child, Quan'er,

400
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,920
you've also hugged him.

401
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,600
You've also carried the children

402
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,160
of Rulan and Hualan.

403
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,040
Can you bear to let them

404
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,640
get dragged down by this troublesome matter

405
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,160
and be destroyed the whole life?

406
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,040
Why are you here?

407
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,160
Why is your complexion so bad?

408
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,960
Brother Changbai!

409
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,720
Changbai is back!

410
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,440
Changbai,

411
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,240
you're back

412
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,720
With Changbai'er back

413
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,920
to support Third Little Sister,

414
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,280
I'm sure that it will be fine now.

415
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,840
Sixth Miss is tired.

416
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,520
Marquis Gu,

417
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,440
quickly assist her out to rest.

418
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,080
Wait!

419
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,070
This matter hasn't finished yet.

420
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,880
The main young master of the house

421
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,680
is back.

422
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,840
You are a daughter that

423
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,040
has been married off and is even pregnant,

424
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,280
stop worrying about your maiden family anymore.

425
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,280
Since a daughter that is married off has nothing

426
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,600
to do with her maiden family anymore.

427
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,480
Why is Old Madam

428
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,360
here then?

429
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,600
This girl used to be so gentle,

430
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,120
submissive, and respectful.

431
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,480
After marrying into the Marquis Manor,

432
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,000
she actually repeatedly

433
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,385
contradicted her elders.

434
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,960
She must be using her status as a marchioness.

435
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,800
That's so weird then.

436
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,600
My wife is the gentlest and most virtuous woman I know.

437
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,080
She's like a little lamb.

438
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,400
What have you done

439
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,560
to make a person

440
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,480
with good temper like her

441
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,480
contradict you?

442
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,320
She's gentle and virtuous?

443
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,080
She's pregnant,

444
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,920
yet she kept talking about executing people.

445
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,560
She's gentle and virtuous?

446
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,720
My wife is timid

447
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,720
She couldn't even bear to hear a chicken being killed,

448
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,800
is afraid of the thunder,

449
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,785
gets dizzy in the sight of the blood,

450
00:20:15,785 --> 00:20:16,640
and hides when someone is injured.

451
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,760
For a person like that

452
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,920
to be forced by all of you

453
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,840
to want to beat up and kill a person now,

454
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,760
It seems that in the present times,

455
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,160
the person who's overbearing gets the final say.

456
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,280
Enough.

457
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,240
With the way you're acting, Marquis Gu

458
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,960
You seem to be determined to continue

459
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,080
this matter until the very end.

460
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,280
I'm an outsider.

461
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,920
This matter is not up to me to decide.

462
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,400
Everything should be decided upon by the Sheng's.

463
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:49,760
That's right.

464
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,640
Changbai is back.

465
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,400
He naturally

466
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,600
A daughter-in-law trying to kill her mother-in-law

467
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,680
is among the ten unpardonable crimes.

468
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,040
Based on the law,

469
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,229
the lightest punishment is execution by beheading,

470
00:21:00,229 --> 00:21:01,560
the gravest is execution by a thousand cuts.

471
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,880
What did you say?

472
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,960
That is your birth mother.

473
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,360
But the one who placed the poison

474
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,360
to kill my grandmother wasn't my mother.

475
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,840
It is Maternal Aunt.

476
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,120
I know the law very well.

477
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,600
Telling you this

478
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,440
is to make us clear about this.

479
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,360
That is right.

480
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,040
She's your blood relative!

481
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,800
In this world,

482
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,000
it's hard to say who's really your relative.

483
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
For so many years,

484
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,760
grandmother gave her all to this family

485
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,440
that's not related to her

486
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,320
by any blood.

487
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,720
A benevolent loving heart, so pure and sincere.

488
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,800
What about Maternal Aunt?

489
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,720
She's related to us

490
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,600
by blood.

491
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,920
Yet despite knowing that if this matter gets exposed

492
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,000
we will die,

493
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,680
she still deceived my mother

494
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,720
to poison my grandmother!

495
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:59,200
When the truth got exposed

496
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,000
she dragged my mother down as her scapegoat.

497
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,400
Maternal Grandmother,

498
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,600
there's a heaven above us.

499
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,520
Do you even want all the deities

500
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,640
to know how ungrateful

501
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,960
the people in this world are?

502
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,160
You

503
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,200
You are destroying your family

504
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,320
just for great righteousness.

505
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,800
Your birth mother has committed a treacherous crime.

506
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,502
She can escape execution,

507
00:22:28,502 --> 00:22:29,760
but she won't be able to escape the sufferings.

508
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,080
Let's see

509
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,910
how a son like you

510
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,680
can shut yourself out from the effects of her crimes.

511
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,920
Of course, I can't.

512
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,729
Bai'er, what are you doing?

513
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,120
On the way here,

514
00:23:07,409 --> 00:23:09,570
I've already written a draft of my resignation letter.

515
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,920
Once the salt taxation matter is done

516
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,910
I'll submit it.

517
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,320
What did you say?

518
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,440
What nonsense are you saying?!

519
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,070
Bai'er, you mustn't!

520
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,040
You mustn't!

521
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,400
He's the most successful child

522
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,480
in our family.

523
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,880
You !

524
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,800
Your political career is currently at its peak!

525
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,440
You

526
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,920
You can't resign.

527
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,440
You can't resign, my child.

528
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,160
My good child, you can't resign.

529
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,120
You've started studying since the age of four.

530
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,440
You studied diligently day and night.

531
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,480
You never delayed it

532
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,480
even for a day.

533
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,400
Even if you developed prickly heat during the summer,

534
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,600
or frost bites during the winter,

535
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,160
you insisted on going to school.

536
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,000
It was mother who dragged you down.

537
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,400
Why was I so stupid?

538
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,280
Stupid to the point

539
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,110
of falling into the trap of my own sister.

540
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:06,960
Mother.

541
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,360
My child.

542
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,360
Mother, no need for you to be sad.

543
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,080
I still have a lot of knowledge.

544
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,200
Even if I don't become an official

545
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,520
I can open up a school.

546
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,960
Shut up!

547
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,640
It's all my fault.

548
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,500
I was wrong.

549
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,040
I'll go admit my crime. I'll accept my punishment.

550
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,520
Getting exiled, caning, or being imprisoned,

551
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,320
I'll accept them all.

552
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,920
Nonsense!

553
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,800
How could you go to the local court?

554
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,040
You can't!

555
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,520
Mother,

556
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,370
from now on,

557
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,440
you will only have one daughter.

558
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,600
Mother, just to save older sister,

559
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,320
you don't even

560
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,560
care about my life,

561
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,320
older brother's political reputation,

562
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,480
the dignity

563
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,640
of the Wang Family,

564
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,520
and even the future of our children.

565
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,280
Since that's the case,

566
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,480
I also don't need to

567
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,120
have a mother anymore.

568
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,240
I'm just planning another way out for us.

569
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,880
You are my flesh.

570
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,320
How could I really watch you

571
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,680
stand in front of the local court?

572
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,920
Do

573
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,240
you all really want me dead?

574
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,240
I'll then use my life

575
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,560
in exchange for your grandmother then.

576
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,240
If one can be executed in behalf of others,

577
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,400
will there still be criminals accepting punishment?

578
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,040
You

579
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:49,760
You disobedient and unfilial child.

580
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,560
You won't even let me die.

581
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,920
Do you still want to slice me into pieces?!

582
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,280
Okay. Okay.

583
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,920
Today,

584
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,520
I'll just hit my head to death here.

585
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,880
I'll let you all get your wish!

586
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:08,840
Mother!

587
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,720
Mother! You mustn't! Mother!

588
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,760
Mother.

589
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,040
What is going on in my house?!

590
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,200
Only now did I know

591
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,240
why that sister-in-law of mine is so fearless.

592
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,804
It's all because she has mother-in-law

593
00:26:31,804 --> 00:26:34,880
holding up the sky to defend her.

594
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,960
When she commits a small mistake, you take care of it.

595
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,240
When she commits a grave mistake,

596
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,880
you still take care of it.

597
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:48,600
These years,

598
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,640
the lives lost in the hands of this sister-in-law

599
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,720
aren't just two or three, am I right?

600
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,480
Brother-in-law, how many did you cover up?

601
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,240
You

602
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,080
Mother-in-law, if not because you spoiled her

603
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,520
since she was little,

604
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,800
how could there be so many lives

605
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,000
lost in her hands?

606
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,880
Enough.

607
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,640
Let our two families

608
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,480
just defend ourselves

609
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,640
in front of the local court then.

610
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,440
Mother,

611
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,040
there are more than a hundred people in our clan.

612
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,720
You mustn't end the future of our whole family

613
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,720
just for one person!

614
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,200
Mother, wake up!

615
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,440
Maternal Grandmother, save my mother.

616
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,520
Look.

617
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,120
When you're not the one being caned

618
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,510
you won't feel how painful it is.

619
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:47,640
As long as the one dying is not a member of one's family,

620
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,640
you can be generous to others.

621
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,280
But once it involves your own,

622
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,280
all the generosity and benevolence

623
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,600
are gone.

624
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,240
Isn't that funny?

625
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,160
These days,

626
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,620
you surely didn't eat properly.

627
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,800
As long as my grandmother can recover,

628
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,200
I'll eat three bowls of rice a day.

629
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,440
Old Madam is awake!

630
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,400
She's awake!

631
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,020
Old Madam is finally awake!

632
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,420
She's awake!

633
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,160
She's awake.

634
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,240
Let's quickly go.

635
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,160
Mother,

636
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,600
you have worried me so much.

637
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,480
Mother.

638
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,200
Old Sister.

639
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,360
You all are here.

640
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,680
You're awake.

641
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,720
Old Sister, you're awake.

642
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,160
Look.

643
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,880
Everything will be alright.

644
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,440
You don't know

645
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,000
You don't know how happy I am.

646
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,840
Thank you for coming over to visit me.

647
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,010
Thank you.

648
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,480
Big Madam, don't be sad.

649
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,720
I'm awake.

650
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,800
Why is Bai'er here?

651
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,400
The salt taxation matter came to an end,

652
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,120
so I'm back.

653
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,800
Seeing that grandmother has woken up

654
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,050
I'm finally at ease.

655
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,160
Ming'er,

656
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,400
don't cry.

657
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,480
I'm old.

658
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,760
That day will eventually come.

659
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,160
It's no big deal.

660
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,920
You're pregnant.

661
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,640
You mustn't cry.

662
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,600
Grandson-in-law.

663
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,560
Control her.

664
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,680
I'm unable to do that.

665
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,360
It's all thanks to that you've finally gotten better.

666
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,400
Once you're healthier,

667
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,000
please giver her some scolding on my behalf.

668
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:32,590
Old Madam is able to take medicine and food by herself.

669
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,400
She just needs to be nursed well and will fully recover.

670
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,400
Everyone, no need to be too worried anymore.

671
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,480
Thank you. Thank you.

672
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:41,710
Okay.

673
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:42,400
You still have a lot to handle in your house.

674
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,360
No need to walk me out.

675
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,269
Thank you, doctor, for your great help.

676
00:30:46,269 --> 00:30:47,920
I've remembered them all in my heart.

677
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,532
Go back home and rest well.

678
00:30:49,532 --> 00:30:50,432
If you need anything in the future,

679
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:51,440
just come to my marquis manor.

680
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,960
I deeply thank doctor for your great help.

681
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,760
Marchioness, you've said it too seriously. Too seriously.

682
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,800
Doctor!

683
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,120
Let's go.

684
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,960
Doctor.

685
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,800
Lord,

686
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,040
no need to worry.

687
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,640
Old Madam is old.

688
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,480
She's like an old child.

689
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,560
She's a bit of a glutton and wouldn't stop eating.

690
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,400
She ate too much of those snacks

691
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,080
and developed stomach upset.

692
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,240
She just needs to nurse herself.

693
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,960
Doctor, you have a benevolent heart and technique.

694
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,040
You are indeed a model to be learned from.

695
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,840
Big Madam,

696
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,280
Old Madam took in a bowl of rice soup

697
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,040
and feels much better now.

698
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,240
She said that she wants to see you.

699
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,600
Slow down.

700
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,200
I know everything.

701
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,040
Nanny Cui couldn't hide it from me,

702
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,600
so she told me everything.

703
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,320
Good child.

704
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,720
You have suffered.

705
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:11,600
Your husband

706
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,960
exhausted two horses to death just to rush back here.

707
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,040
Good. Good.

708
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,480
I'm at ease now.

709
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,520
In the future, even if I really die,

710
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,240
I won't leave

711
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,760
any worries behind.

712
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,520
Grandmother, don't say such kind of words.

713
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,960
You have a good rest please.

714
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,320
When you are more energetic, we can talk.

715
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,720
I fear that it will be too late to say then.

716
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,560
Your husband is a man with a violent temper,

717
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,880
and bears grudges.

718
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,360
Now you are pregnant.

719
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,000
If these people bully you,

720
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,280
he surely will get

721
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,160
that Kang woman's life.

722
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,920
She poisoned you.

723
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,840
Of course, she must pay with her life.

724
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,200
Silly child.

725
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,000
It's easy to take her life.

726
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,520
But have you thought about that

727
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,640
we still are in-laws

728
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,600
with the House of Wang despite that?

729
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,360
Even if we

730
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,640
get rid of this relationship

731
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,960
and not be in-laws anymore,

732
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,400
don't forget,

733
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,520
the House of Wang still has a father

734
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,973
that was given privilege to be worshiped

735
00:33:50,973 --> 00:33:52,080
in the royal ancestral hall?

736
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,080
Even though he's not around anymore,

737
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,160
he still has a lot of existing connections.

738
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,720
If you drive a dog into a blind alley

739
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,200
you surely will suffer too.

740
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,640
So what?

741
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,640
I'm just going to let her go like that?

742
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,160
I don't want to.

743
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,080
Good child.

744
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,480
Once, Xiang Yu was invincible.

745
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,520
Han Xin set up an ambush to surround him,

746
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,440
but he still must open up one side of the net

747
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,840
to leave a space for him to escape.

748
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,800
He dared not to fully surround him to his death.

749
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,640
Do you know why?

750
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,675
He was afraid that Xiang Yu

751
00:34:39,675 --> 00:34:40,680
decide to fight win or die,

752
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,040
and will risk his life to deal him a deadly blow.

753
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,320
Right.

754
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,040
You must let a losing army

755
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,015
see hope,

756
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,960
so they won't get forced in a corner

757
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,080
and be driven to desperate action.

758
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,160
Now, your husband is away, investigating the salt taxation.

759
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,240
You are pregnant at home.

760
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:13,480
In the palace, the empress dowager

761
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,280
is eyeing covetously on the emperor.

762
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,960
The emperor has completely placed his hope on our Bai'er

763
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:24,040
and your husband to clearly investigate the salt taxation,

764
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,440
so he can win this round.

765
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:30,945
Now, the two of them returned to the capital without permission,

766
00:35:30,945 --> 00:35:33,360
while their official task isn't done yet.

767
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,360
If this gets investigated,

768
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,120
that's already a crime of them.

769
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,000
But, I hate her.

770
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,880
She bullied you since you're alone.

771
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,480
She wanted to kill you by poisoning you.

772
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,120
I so want to kill her

773
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,480
with a thousand slices, then thousand slices.

774
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,880
Or else,

775
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,581
I would have lived in vain!

776
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,840
I understand. I understand.

777
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,080
Your grandmother is already awake.

778
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,320
Why must you still hold tightly

779
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,920
on your Maternal Aunt and won't let her go?

780
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:10,120
Either you cane her

781
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,560
or imprison her in the palace prison.

782
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,360
Your maternal aunt is from a prestigious family.

783
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,480
In her whole life, she never suffered even a superficial wound.

784
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,080
How could she bear being caned?

785
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,920
The caning must be done.

786
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,720
She also must be sent to the palace prison.

787
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,600
You

788
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,560
Grandmother was fortunate to have preserved her life.

789
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,840
That's already the heaven having eyes,

790
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,190
Bodhisattva blessing her.

791
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,049
In addition, the royal physician

792
00:36:40,049 --> 00:36:41,000
meticulously treated her.

793
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,200
How does all of that have anything to do with Maternal Aunt?!

794
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,280
Maternal Aunt was hell bent

795
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,720
to kill her.

796
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,840
If we just let her go like this

797
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,360
she still will create endless troubles

798
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,240
in the future.

799
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:00,120
In disciplining one's children,

800
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,840
you should be harsh.

801
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:04,680
Doesn't maternal grandmother know

802
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,400
such a simple principle?

803
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,240
But your maternal grandmother didn't die.

804
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,680
You said it so wrongly.

805
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,440
A person has a hundred of ways of living.

806
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,880
Our Old Madam

807
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,080
has a healthy body

808
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,240
and could have lived

809
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,080
to 118 years old.

810
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,280
But now,

811
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,080
she can only live to 108 years old.

812
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,360
She initially could listen to songs, watch lanterns

813
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,280
go up the mountain to pray to Buddha.

814
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,080
But now, she can only rely on

815
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:32,840
drinking medicinal soup to live her days.

816
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,720
How are you to compensate for losses like that?

817
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,720
That's right.

818
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,920
Our Quan'er

819
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,520
can't play with my grandmother anymore.

820
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,720
What my wife said is right.

821
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:47,240
We also don't know how long

822
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,360
my wife's maternal aunt can live.

823
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,840
We can't really count the days

824
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,720
to execute her, right?

825
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,680
I think

826
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,080
we should just do the required caning.

827
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,240
Treat it as a compensation

828
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,480
to the suffering of our Old Madam.

829
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,720
Just let her complete the required jail time.

830
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,600
Treat that as a compensation to our Old Madam

831
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,480
ending up in an impoverished state of being bed-ridden.

832
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,360
We didn't take any advantage of you.

833
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,120
You

834
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,240
You dare say such words?

835
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,400
I haven't said

836
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,310
the harsher words yet.

837
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,800
Your family was quite nimble

838
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,350
in punishing my mother.

839
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,000
What about your own Big Madam?!

840
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,920
Is it your turn to talk?!

841
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,720
My mother was disrespectful to grandmother.

842
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,160
She developed an unfilial and disobedient thought.

843
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,640
Of course, she must be punished.

844
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,880
From now on, she will pray to the deities and Buddha

845
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,080
to ask for blessings for grandmother.

846
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,280
Yes.

847
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,120
I

848
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,080
In the back of my courtyard, I plan to

849
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,280
build a

850
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,360
Not inside our house.

851
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,480
Yes.

852
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,040
I know that my mistake isn't small.

853
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,800
I'll stay below the Yuqing Temple. I

854
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,840
Not in the capital.

855
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,000
Mother,

856
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,160
if you are to repent for your sins,

857
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,320
if you are to admit your mistakes,

858
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,520
you should be serious.

859
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,320
You must return to our old house in Youyang

860
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,600
and cultivate inside our ancestral hall.

861
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,520
Be a vegetarian, pray to Buddha, and repent on your sins.

862
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,160
Other than holidays,

863
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,040
mother can't leave

864
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,440
the ancestral hall by a step.

865
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,240
Isn't that being imprisoned too?

866
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,408
You have committed a crime,

867
00:39:47,408 --> 00:39:48,200
yet you still don't know how to repent and mend your ways.

868
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,000
You won't accept your punishment!

869
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,400
With such a mother,

870
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,120
I'm ashamed to be an official then.

871
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,200
You

872
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,600
Who are you threatening?!

873
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,840
I'm not allowed to do it in our house,

874
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,080
nor in the capital!

875
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,520
I'll just go in the city outskirts,

876
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,520
in the province, in our farmsteads, all is fine.

877
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,640
I

878
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,800
Why must I return to

879
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,840
our hometown in Youyang?

880
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,480
I don't know anyone there.

881
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,800
I see.

882
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,640
You are looking down

883
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,515
on Eldest Paternal Aunt-in-law's maiden family

884
00:40:21,515 --> 00:40:22,400
as being merchants.

885
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,320
You once sneered and mocked at her,

886
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:28,600
You will be under

887
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,400
paternal aunt-in-law's care.

888
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,917
Of course, you're unwilling.

889
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:37,720
But I feel that only by

890
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,560
forcing you to leave us

891
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,280
and going to a place

892
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,480
that is difficult for you

893
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:47,160
would make you

894
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,440
carefully reflect on

895
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,120
these many years,

896
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,000
so many people,

897
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,680
and so many matters,

898
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,560
what was right and wrong on earth.

899
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:07,400
A place that's too comfortable

900
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,240
can't quiet down one's heart.

901
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,440
How long will I be there?

902
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,240
Ten years.

903
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,960
You unfilial thing.

904
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,360
You

905
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,280
I

906
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,280
I shouldn't have given birth to you.

907
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,040
I should have just given birth to a rat.

908
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,520
You unfilial thing.

909
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,280
You vile spawn.

910
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,080
A vile spawn.

911
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,720
Is cousin now satisfied?

912
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,920
Sixth Little Sister,

913
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,280
you are pregnant.

914
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,360
It's not right for you

915
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,000
to watch the implementation of the punishment anymore.

916
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:14,920
Okay.

917
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,520
It's already around 10 p.m.

918
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,800
You should go back and rest.

919
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,320
Right.

920
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,360
Everyone is tired.

921
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,680
I've exhausted two horses to death today.

922
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,760
Wife, let's go.

923
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,680
How can you be the one here speaking?

924
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,680
Where's your father?

925
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,160
Either you cane her

926
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,880
or just lock her up.

927
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,040
You want to have both?!

928
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,400
I haven't died yet.

929
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,000
Dongrong.

930
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,120
Here.

931
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:10,960
Bring her in.

932
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:12,520
Yes.

933
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,640
Implement the punishment!

934
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,200
You

935
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,360
You scared me.

936
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,216
You've always been steady.

937
00:43:47,946 --> 00:43:51,220
How come you're so ready to risk everything this time?

938
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,280
I probably was so scary.

939
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,160
I read the letter that

940
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:58,880
your sister-in-law

941
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,880
sent to your brother.

942
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,035
Surrounding your maternal house,

943
00:44:02,035 --> 00:44:04,640
angrily scolding at your birth father,

944
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:06,155
forcefully capturing people.

945
00:44:06,155 --> 00:44:08,990
You were daring without thinking your safety.

946
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:11,440
Are you still the Minglan I saw before

947
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,880
who always put her own safety above everything

948
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,600
and never committed any mistake?

949
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:20,265
This time,

950
00:44:20,355 --> 00:44:23,550
I fear that I've caused you a lot of trouble again.

951
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:24,880
Did I scare you?

952
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,160
In my heart, there's only one thought.

953
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,040
I must protect you.
