00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Ming Lan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Episode 40

3
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,320
Among these things, there are farmlands,

4
00:01:08,695 --> 00:01:13,000
houses, shops, storefronts, and...

5
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,320
There's one farmstead which is my favorite.

6
00:01:17,497 --> 00:01:19,097
It's just in the countryside of our capital,

7
00:01:19,097 --> 00:01:20,800
around six hundred mu of fertile farmlands.

8
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:24,680
The person in-charge is Nanny Cui's husband.

9
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,960
This person is quite honest.

10
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,400
He'll be going with you

11
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,320
when you are married.

12
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,520
Beside this farmstead，

13
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,200
there's a small mountain forest.

14
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,960
It's not huge, but the fengshui is very good.

15
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,280
Two years ago，

16
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,640
I bought it together with the farmstead.

17
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,440
I asked old man Cui to find a few able men

18
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,160
to manage it and plant a few fruit trees.

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,680
Why are you in a daze?

20
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,720
Do you still remember

21
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,680
the farmstead affairs that I've taught you?

22
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,440
I do.

23
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,283
In using people, trust is important.

24
00:02:09,283 --> 00:02:10,520
I must frequently inspect.

25
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,640
No matter how honest a servant is,

26
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,040
there must be an able person supervising him.

27
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,346
As time goes by,

28
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:19,125
They can't help to

29
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:19,920
develop improper desires,

30
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,600
but you also mustn't suspect them too much

31
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,000
too much of it will disappoint them.

32
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:26,900
Grandmother,

33
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,860
must I inform

34
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,440
the He Family?

35
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,360
What for?

36
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,450
We never really promised them

37
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,400
that you're going to marry off their house.

38
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,840
No need for you to be bothered by this matter.

39
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,000
I'll just go and talk to them.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,800
The He Family, other than Old Madam He,

41
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,440
don't bother seeing any of them.

42
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,120
Now

43
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,000
no one is going to hinder them

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,240
from being good people.

45
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,920
Let them go helping

46
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,360
their relatives happily.

47
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,960
For you, you are not marring off no family but them.

48
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,200
Let everyone know

49
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,825
that the daughters of our Sheng Family

50
00:03:08,825 --> 00:03:09,920
are really popular.

51
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,320
There are always someone wanting to marry you.

52
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,240
Yes.

53
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,600
Let's talk no more about that.

54
00:03:17,672 --> 00:03:20,068
Come, let me count your dowry again.

55
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,920
It's enough, Grandmother.

56
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,520
No need to,

57
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,960
Father even had Big Madam

58
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,960
prepare the same dowry

59
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,280
as Fifth Sister.

60
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,240
Those twenty boxes

61
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,280
that Gu Tingye send over

62
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:30,975
have already been included

63
00:03:30,975 --> 00:03:31,680
on to the list of my dowry

64
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,920
according to your instructions.

65
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,680
With so much stuff, it's already enough.

66
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,280
Not enough at all!

67
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,600
Do you think you will have a good life

68
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,040
in that huge Gu Family?

69
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,050
Above you, there's a mother-in-law,

70
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,840
sisters-in-law, the wives of his brothers.

71
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,075
Below you, the steward maidservant

72
00:03:53,075 --> 00:03:54,120
and other female attendants.

73
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,600
Who among them is easy to handle?

74
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,480
When you get in,

75
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,200
you surely will be using your money.

76
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,280
Everyone knows

77
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,800
what my status is here.

78
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,520
I don't really need to make appearances.

79
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,720
I'll just do what should be done.

80
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,480
I'll just live meticulously.

81
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,040
But Grandmother,

82
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,360
you're not young.

83
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,360
You must keep some money with you.

84
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,680
I did keep some with me.

85
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,800
No need for you to worry.

86
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,975
Just because you are marrying

87
00:04:24,975 --> 00:04:25,880
into a higher status family,

88
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,520
we must prepare more dowry?

89
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,000
Grandmother, think about

90
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,675
Eldest Sister's previous situation

91
00:04:36,675 --> 00:04:37,520
in the Yuan Family.

92
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,720
Did she lack of money?

93
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,800
Did she live well?

94
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,173
It shows that

95
00:04:43,173 --> 00:04:45,560
money can't buy

96
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,440
doting and respect.

97
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,320
You're talking childishly.

98
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,240
The Gu Family isn't easy to deal with.

99
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,800
Especially that stepmother of his,

100
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,320
Big Madam Qin.

101
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,080
Gu Tingye

102
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,120
has already told me

103
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,520
the situation of his Gu Family.

104
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,280
Before, I only had a general idea about it.

105
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,400
After hearing the details,

106
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,480
it really made me daisy.

107
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,600
I then thought about

108
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,400
whether it's already too late

109
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,680
to cancel the wedding.

110
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,320
You're afraid?

111
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,160
A little.

112
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,520
Thinking how

113
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,040
he schemed just to marry you,

114
00:05:28,242 --> 00:05:30,120
I'm sure he won't let you starve.

115
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,120
I'm not afraid that he'll treat me badly.

116
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,360
I'm afraid that he'll treat me too well.

117
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,880
I don't have the fortune to accept such treatment.

118
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,640
Nonsense! Who said you don't have that?

119
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,475
Although you lost your birth mother

120
00:05:43,475 --> 00:05:44,200
when you were little,

121
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,480
you have me backing you up.

122
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,440
Now you're going to marry a good husband

123
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,680
with an indomitable spirit.

124
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,509
Your good days are about to start,

125
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,520
so don't say such depressing words.

126
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,480
I can't bear to part with you.

127
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,040
Tomorrow,

128
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,960
you're going to get married.

129
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,560
You must happily

130
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,880
leave the gate of our house.

131
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,280
Grandmother, I don't want to leave you.

132
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,560
I don't want to leave you too.

133
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,400
Once you leave,

134
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,960
you can still come back anytime.

135
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,160
Once you are stable on your feet in the Gu Family,

136
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,280
you can come back to visit me anytime.

137
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,360
What great winds and waves have I not seen?

138
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,080
Get on the horse!

139
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,800
My dear ancestors, please listen.

140
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,025
I'm getting married today,

141
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,760
but I dare not act arbitrarily.

142
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,150
I will continue to light incense

143
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,880
for all of you the whole year round.

144
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,040
Please tell the deities to pity me.

145
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,675
A man and woman getting married

146
00:07:51,675 --> 00:07:53,080
is the nature of things.

147
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,300
Hoping we both will be auspicious

148
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,920
and full of celebration.

149
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,400
Hoping there are no disasters or difficulties,

150
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,320
and we'll be safe for hundreds of years.

151
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,000
Like a fish in the water,

152
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,160
let us be more sweet than honey.

153
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:21,200
No! No! No!

154
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,160
We have to test Commander Gu!

155
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,840
Right!

156
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,560
What test?

157
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,080
Let me go first.

158
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,475
Second Gu, you're great

159
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:30,800
at martial arts and military tactics.

160
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,000
If your and the enemy's army

161
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,360
are both ten thousand in number,

162
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,520
and you meet on a flat plain,

163
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,680
how are you going to win?

164
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,720
Husband of Sheng's Fourth Miss,

165
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,230
with such a measly number of troops,

166
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,750
no need for Second Young Master Gu

167
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,040
to personally come out.

168
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,880
I'll be the vanguard.

169
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,520
May I ask...

170
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,120
This plain

171
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,250
is in the southern part of the country

172
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,080
or on the northern borders?

173
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,105
That's right!

174
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,360
Is it in the south or north?

175
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,840
Is our army made up of cavalry or footmen?

176
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,440
That's right!

177
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,920
Are the enemies

178
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,653
from the Wanyan Clan?

179
00:08:58,653 --> 00:08:59,200
Yelü Clan?

180
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,880
or the Li of Western Xia?

181
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,120
Right!

182
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,920
Indeed!

183
00:09:04,454 --> 00:09:05,400
Give a reply, Young Lord Liang!

184
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,840
Beyond the flat land,

185
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,670
is it flat plain or mountains?

186
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,920
Is there water and trees in the river?

187
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,360
Right! Are there trees?

188
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,760
Answer! Answer!

189
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,920
Today is such an auspicious day!

190
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,175
I've long heard that Commander Gu

191
00:09:17,175 --> 00:09:18,360
has outstanding literary skills.

192
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,175
Why not make a poem to hasten the bride

193
00:09:20,175 --> 00:09:21,189
in dressing herself up?

194
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,040
If we find it good,

195
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,800
you can then enter to meet your bride.

196
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,560
Right!

197
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,240
Okay. Make a poem.

198
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,840
Second Young Master, in terms of making poems,

199
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,440
we can't help you.

200
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,800
You must do it yourself.

201
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,600
Come on!

202
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:35,750
It's not hard

203
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,640
to prompt the bride in her preparations.

204
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:37,127
What's hard is

205
00:09:37,127 --> 00:09:38,040
if your Sixth Miss

206
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,482
will refuse to come out!

207
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,040
Indeed!

208
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,640
I'll make a poem to try to welcome her.

209
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,950
Willing to ride the golden carriage,

210
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,600
but afraid of the eastern winds.

211
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,025
Pushing apart the clouds to see the moon,

212
00:09:50,025 --> 00:09:51,560
getting drunk as the cup is emptied.

213
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,600
Good! Good!

214
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,725
Willing to ride the golden carriage,

215
00:09:56,725 --> 00:09:58,200
but afraid of the eastern winds.

216
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,300
Pushing apart the clouds to see the moon,

217
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,800
getting drunk as the cup is emptied.

218
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,000
Miss,

219
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,560
stop drinking cold wine please.

220
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,880
And then?

221
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,625
With fairy-like beauty,

222
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,280
you are shy to speak out our heart.

223
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,025
The cool white porcelain inadvertently reveals

224
00:10:14,025 --> 00:10:14,680
a small blush of red.

225
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,760
After reciting that,

226
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,500
the husband of Fourth Miss

227
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,560
then gave him an enthusiastic approval.

228
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,960
How did he know?

229
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,480
But what do

230
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,760
those lines mean?

231
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,080
It means that our Miss

232
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,280
should get into the palanquin already.

233
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,875
However, she's still afraid of so many things,

234
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:30,640
and refusing to go out.

235
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,670
He asks our Miss to have more sips of cold wine

236
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,720
to have courage.

237
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,180
Once the cup is empty,

238
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,380
she's bolder,

239
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,320
and her face also flushed.

240
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,680
You don't even need to use any more rouge.

241
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,600
The husband of our Miss

242
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,700
has already completely seen through you,

243
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,120
Sixth Miss!

244
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,480
Stop dilly-dallying.

245
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,480
Quickly set out now.

246
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,175
No matter how much you delay it,

247
00:10:45,175 --> 00:10:46,000
you won't be able to stay here anymore.

248
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,280
Xiaotao, go watching by the door

249
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,352
and guide the new groom over here.

250
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,680
Don't let the men of our house

251
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,960
make things too difficult for him.

252
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,040
Commander Gu, you have such great literary talent.

253
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,825
If you abandon being a military officer

254
00:10:56,825 --> 00:10:57,550
and join the scholarly ranks instead,

255
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:57,558
you will surely

256
00:10:57,558 --> 00:10:58,920
you will surely

257
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,920
Hey! Second Gu is a rare talented commander.

258
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,640
Is a rare talented commander.

259
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,920
While the borders haven't been reclaimed,

260
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,100
how can he giving up being a military man?

261
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,160
Indeed! Right!

262
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,640
From now on,

263
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,450
the Commander-in-chief must call me

264
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,000
an older brother-in-law.

265
00:11:10,012 --> 00:11:10,880
I then must test him

266
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,880
to make things difficult for him!

267
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,880
Right. Right!

268
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,880
Oh, stop it!

269
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,200
Your City Guard Office is also under our command!

270
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,680
Is also under our command!

271
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:19,968
It's time to give out the red envelopes!

272
00:11:19,968 --> 00:11:21,176
Everyone gets a share!

273
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,440
Giving out red envelopes!

274
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,240
Giving out red envelopes!

275
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,440
Red envelopes! Red envelopes!

276
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,280
There are spies within

277
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,640
with wavering will.

278
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,440
There are strong enemies outside

279
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,480
who are sly and cunning.

280
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,240
The city walls have been coptured.

281
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,000
We can do nothing but futile efforts.

282
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,080
Second Young Master,

283
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,440
the husbands of the other misses

284
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,640
also did their best to hinder him.

285
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,455
Even if they didn't achieve victorious merit,

286
00:11:55,455 --> 00:11:56,160
they did exert some efforts.

287
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,880
But you didn't join in stopping him earlier.

288
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,480
A few days ago,

289
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,480
the husband of your Sixth Miss

290
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,080
gifted me

291
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,275
a painting of Cold Snow on the Wu River

292
00:12:07,275 --> 00:12:08,320
by Gao Keming.

293
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,275
Then you still dare to

294
00:12:11,275 --> 00:12:12,320
describe the husbands of the other misses

295
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,320
as being "spies with wavering will"?

296
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,600
I'd already accepted the painting,

297
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,480
so I shouldn't stop him any further.

298
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,080
But it has nothing to do with my

299
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,040
talking with them, right?

300
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,240
Xiaotao.

301
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,480
You must remember this.

302
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,040
In dealing with people,

303
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,160
you must clearly discern right from wrong.

304
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,840
Second Young Master is really...

305
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,520
Father-in-law,

306
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,200
please accept tea from me.

307
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,469
From now on,

308
00:13:17,469 --> 00:13:19,640
the two of you should respect and love each other.

309
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,900
Help each other through difficult times

310
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,560
until you grow old together.

311
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,640
Have abundant offspring.

312
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,075
Speak cautiously

313
00:13:26,075 --> 00:13:27,160
and be a good model to your children.

314
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,600
I understand.

315
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,400
I understand.

316
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,200
Mother-in-law,

317
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,800
please drink this tea that I offer.

318
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,080
From now on,

319
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,880
you must be benevolent, cautious,

320
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,880
discuss everything with your husband,

321
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,880
and go through tribulations hand in hand.

322
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,200
I understand.

323
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,080
May Mother-in-law be at ease.

324
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,560
Okay already.

325
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,360
Go now. Go now.

326
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,400
The bride is going out now!

327
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,040
Minglan!

328
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,640
Be well...

329
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,840
Be well...

330
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,280
Go now.

331
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,760
Lower the palanquin!

332
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,880
Raise the carriage!

333
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,280
Miss, don't mess your make-up from crying.

334
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,520
Please wipe your tears.

335
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,240
Miss, don't be afraid.

336
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:29,840
Today, you'll be married.

337
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,725
After three days,

338
00:16:30,725 --> 00:16:32,200
you'll be allowed to return home.

339
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,840
You can see Old Madam then.

340
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,400
Miss must be having a stomachache from starving,

341
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,680
that's why she's crying.

342
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,440
Miss, I brought a basket of fruits.

343
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,520
There's something to eat

344
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,840
If you're hungry, just tell me.

345
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,480
Don't endure it.

346
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,400
Cousin, let's go back.

347
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,160
If Grandmother knows that

348
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,200
you came here,

349
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,720
she will be so pissed.

350
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,240
Grandmother and Old Madam Sheng

351
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,480
have decades of friendship.

352
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,840
They won't turn hostile against each other

353
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,960
for a marriage talk that wasn't publicized.

354
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,160
As old friends,

355
00:17:37,324 --> 00:17:39,440
they will still see each other in the future.

356
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,680
Moreover, as long as you don't tell her,

357
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,320
she won't know.

358
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,280
I won't say it.

359
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,760
I definitely won't say it.

360
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,200
In a few days, I'm going to Yungui

361
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,080
to buy some medicinal ingredients.

362
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:53,650
In passing,

363
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:54,960
I will be visiting some famous doctors.

364
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,440
I will linger there for a while.

365
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,360
I'm afraid I will be gone for two or three years.

366
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,200
You should just follow my mother

367
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,360
and return to our old manor in Baishitan.

368
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,000
I...

369
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,061
I... Can't I go with you?

370
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,920
Yungui is home to high mountains and deep rivers.

371
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,320
The travel is quite dangerous.

372
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,960
I fear that I will have to brave the wind and dew.

373
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,560
How can you handle that?

374
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,280
Bow to the parents!

375
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,760
Old Geng,

376
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,360
this is my first time seeing people bowing

377
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,225
to two memorial tablets and one live person

378
00:18:43,225 --> 00:18:43,960
during a wedding.

379
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,280
Isn't this telling everyone

380
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,840
that Second Brother Gu has a different mother?

381
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,000
Surprisingly, Big Madam Qin agreed to it.

382
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,720
I heard that from the start,

383
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,111
this Big Madam was unwilling.

384
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,600
Afterward, I don't know what method Second Gu used

385
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,200
to force her to agree.

386
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,080
That Big Madam Qin is quit beautiful,

387
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,800
she looks amicable.

388
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,520
Shut up.

389
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,320
You think she's amicable?

390
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,680
Which side are you on?

391
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,000
Of course it's Second Master Gu's.

392
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,400
Offering of tea!

393
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,500
Memorial Tablets of Lady Bai

394
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,560
Sister-in-law,

395
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,440
quickly put down the fan!

396
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,320
Second Brother has great fortune!

397
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,325
Great auspicious blessings!

398
00:20:17,325 --> 00:20:19,500
Still harmonious together after a hundred years!

399
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,175
Hope that luxuriant growth

400
00:20:20,175 --> 00:20:20,750
in this wonderful atmosphere

401
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,320
will grow and not fade away.

402
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,500
What you see in the painting hall

403
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,800
during the morning is spring breeze!

404
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,350
Wishing you great fortune

405
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,840
and to be united forever!

406
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,575
For all eternity,

407
00:20:48,575 --> 00:20:49,825
your hair is tied together

408
00:20:49,825 --> 00:20:51,000
for the rest of your life.

409
00:20:51,105 --> 00:20:52,785
Wishing you great blessings and fortune!

410
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,200
Okay! Okay!

411
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,700
The nuptial drink,

412
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,120
for you two to have a good relationship forever.

413
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,840
Okay.

414
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,840
Bottoms up.

415
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,720
I drank it all.

416
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,160
You really drank all of it!

417
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,840
Good! Good!

418
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,200
Groom and bride, I wish you two great blessings.

419
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,440
Thank you. Thank you. Go and get your reward.

420
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,720
Good!

421
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Good!

422
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,880
Okay! Okay!

423
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,040
Hurry! Hurry! Now that you're done here,

424
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,960
quickly go out and offer toasts.

425
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,720
Right!

426
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,520
Today, we must get you drunk!

427
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,515
Let's go, Second Brother!

428
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,720
Come! Come!

429
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,000
You think I'm afraid of you?

430
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,675
Let's go!

431
00:21:48,693 --> 00:21:48,920
Go!

432
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,960
Hurry! Hurry! Won't stop until drunk!

433
00:21:51,287 --> 00:21:52,447
Move! Move! Won't stop until drunk!

434
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,480
Miss,

435
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,120
don't touch those.

436
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,680
If people from the Gu family see it,

437
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,200
you'll get laughed at.

438
00:22:13,614 --> 00:22:13,964
Oh.

439
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,280
Danju, I'm so hungry.

440
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,040
Can you get me something to eat?

441
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,280
Xiaotao already went to get something.

442
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,120
Miss, just wait for a while.

443
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,680
Thanks. Thanks.

444
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,360
Okay.

445
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,680
Come. Come.

446
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,560
Come. Come. Second Brother.

447
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,800
Thanks. Thanks. Congratulations!

448
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,760
Thanks.

449
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,800
Eldest Brother!

450
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,000
Excuse me.

451
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,000
Eldest Brother.

452
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,120
You're returning to your room already?

453
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,840
Let me offer you a toast as respect.

454
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,840
Because of my health, I don't drink wine.

455
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,120
You know that.

456
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,200
Shitou!

457
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,320
Yes!

458
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,520
Young Master.

459
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,518
This is er chen soup.

460
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,225
It promotes body fluid production

461
00:23:25,225 --> 00:23:25,831
and can quench one's thirst.

462
00:23:25,831 --> 00:23:26,600
Let's use this to replace wine.

463
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,040
Eldest Brother,

464
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,280
at least preserve my dignity.

465
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,280
Otherwise, with so many people around,

466
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,480
I'll get laughed at.

467
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,520
This is a wedding granted by the Emperor

468
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,550
and there are so many people

469
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,320
from the palace assigned here

470
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,320
to organize it for you.

471
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,560
With such glory and splendor,

472
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,920
who would dare laugh at you?

473
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,440
That is indeed the case,

474
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,160
but I can't forget

475
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,900
how devoted you were to give me lessons

476
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,480
as I grew up.

477
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,760
Without you and Big Madam,

478
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,760
how could I achieve all this today?

479
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,400
You'd better just drink this.

480
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,320
Thank you, Eldest Brother.

481
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,160
Fourth Uncle and Fifth Uncle,

482
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,320
come, let's drink.

483
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,160
Here. Let me offer you a toast out of respect.

484
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,400
Who is it?

485
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,760
Rong?

486
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:07,920
What's wrong?

487
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,680
Why are you laughing?

488
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,600
Do I look very ugly right now?

489
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,275
You're that Big Sister

490
00:25:14,275 --> 00:25:15,360
who fell into the water that time.

491
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,320
It was my father who saved you.

492
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,840
It's not Sister. You should call me Auntie.

493
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,520
Wait.

494
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,120
You should call me "Mother" now.

495
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,880
I have a mother!

496
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,520
You're not my mother!

497
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,400
Then...

498
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,240
call me Big Madam for now then.

499
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:38,800
Rong,

500
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,800
why are you still not go to bed so late?

501
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,400
Someone told me

502
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,960
that once Father marries a bride,

503
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,400
he won't want me anymore.

504
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,400
I came to see

505
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,880
what the bride looks like.

506
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,840
Who told you that?

507
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,300
Nanny Xiang, the servant to

508
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,600
Grandmother Qin said so.

509
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,360
She said that once you have children,

510
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,880
Father won't care about me anymore.

511
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,120
What are you holding?

512
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,600
Let me see.

513
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,640
So,

514
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,720
you came here to scare me

515
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,520
and draw a beard on my face?

516
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,280
I'm planning to draw a turtle.

517
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,920
Will you still draw it now?

518
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,680
I like you.

519
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,080
Father asked me

520
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,560
if it's okay that he marries you.

521
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,880
I said, "Sure!"

522
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,075
Your father indeed

523
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,760
racked his brains hard just to trick me.

524
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,800
He even cleared the way for me in connecting

525
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,240
with his own daughter.

526
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,360
Big Madam, I'm hungry.

527
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,600
I have these. Come.

528
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,840
And these.

529
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,640
All are yours.

530
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,310
Old Geng, don't go!

531
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,325
I must drink with you today

532
00:27:04,325 --> 00:27:05,600
until you fall flat on the ground

533
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,240
from drunkenness!

534
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,675
Let your wife

535
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,872
beat you up when you go back to your house!

536
00:27:11,718 --> 00:27:13,958
Young Master, General Geng has left already.

537
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:15,120
Quickly put down his hat.

538
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,840
We're going to your marriage room now.

539
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,280
Shouldn't we be going this way?

540
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,160
No! No! Young Master!

541
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,480
That way is towards the kitchen!

542
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,475
We're going to your marriage chamber.

543
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,000
This way. This way.

544
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,680
Really?

545
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,800
Never thought those scholarly officials

546
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,880
are so good at drinking.

547
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,080
Even an old military general like Old Geng

548
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,160
are drunk.

549
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,625
That was so close.

550
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,240
Young Master, lower your voice.

551
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,320
If your bride hears it,

552
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,280
she'll laugh at you.

553
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,480
She already knows

554
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,280
what kind of person I am.

555
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,800
In terms of pretending to be dumb and in a daze,

556
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,440
we're almost the same.

557
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,520
We are a match made in heaven.

558
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,920
Young Master, please.

559
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,840
Wife, I pay my respects to you.

560
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,720
Why are you still pretending?

561
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,440
What appearance of yours have I not seen?

562
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,720
This woman should only be present in the heavens.

563
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,320
It would be rare to see one in this mortal world.

564
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,520
Lower your voice.

565
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,080
Don't wake the child up.

566
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,880
Rong eats and sleeps well.

567
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,280
She usually sleeps right after having a full meal,

568
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,440
that even if there is thunder,

569
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,520
she won't wake up.

570
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,000
You're hungry?

571
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,750
Why didn't you ask the servants

572
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,560
to deliver you food?

573
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,400
I did.

574
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,000
But after a few chew,

575
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,400
your daughter came.

576
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,200
I must take care of the child first, right?

577
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,075
If everything's been eaten,

578
00:29:42,075 --> 00:29:43,200
you could just ask them to deliver some more.

579
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:45,600
This is the Marquis House.

580
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,725
If the bride keeps asking for the food

581
00:29:46,725 --> 00:29:47,520
in the middle of the night,

582
00:29:47,537 --> 00:29:48,840
won't I get laughed at?

583
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,600
You're my wife.

584
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,720
Who dares to laugh at you?

585
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,760
But...

586
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,450
the food here in the Marquis House

587
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:00,400
isn't that tasty.

588
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,760
Where's my outer robe?

589
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,960
Later, tell someone to take Rong away.

590
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,680
Let her stay and sleep in her room.

591
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,040
Who am I calling?

592
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,280
You call them yourself.

593
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,960
You're going out?

594
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,880
What? You can't bear me leaving?

595
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,680
You don't want me to go out?

596
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,040
Go.

597
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,800
Remove your headdress.

598
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,520
Isn't your neck tired?

599
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:25,440
These are the dishes you ordered.

600
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,720
They're freshly cooked and still hot.

601
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,770
Okay. Put it on my tab.

602
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:29,570
Second Young Master,

603
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:30,640
oh, wrong, General Gu.

604
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,840
You haven't been here for quite a long time.

605
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,275
Aren't you going to sit for a while

606
00:31:33,275 --> 00:31:34,118
and have some drinks?

607
00:31:34,118 --> 00:31:34,918
I won't anymore.

608
00:31:34,918 --> 00:31:37,017
My wife is still waiting for her food.

609
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:41,880
Young Master,

610
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,360
Young Master, on your wedding night,

611
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,880
you went out to buy food for your wife.

612
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,640
Aren't you afraid that people will laugh at you?

613
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,880
Just let them know then.

614
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,960
I exactly want everyone to know

615
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,080
that my wife can have whatever she wants.

616
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:53,800
Aren't you afraid that people will think

617
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,120
Sixth Miss is a devil?

618
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,720
Devil?

619
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,760
Have you seen

620
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,120
such a beautiful devil?

621
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,920
At such a young age,

622
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,280
how come you know so many fake school theory?

623
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,160
Sixth Miss herself doesn't mind.

624
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,240
If this gets out, won't all the prople in the capital

625
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,440
think that I'm a devil?

626
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,320
Was the headdress too heavy?

627
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,400
I've just told Shitou

628
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,400
that you don't mind false reputations like that.

629
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,680
But in an instant, you have proved me wrong.

630
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,960
I indeed don't mind,

631
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,000
but you didn't have to deliberately do it.

632
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,920
bread pitas soked lamb soup,

633
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,191
Crab.

634
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,360
Duck claws.

635
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,320
Come, taste them.

636
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,640
What is this?

637
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,400
Guess.

638
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,000
Just eat.

639
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,040
This is soft cheese.

640
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,120
Is it delicious?

641
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,960
While in front of your own husband,

642
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,040
stop being so demure.

643
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,240
I fear that I might get used to it.

644
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,760
You marrying me isn't climbing the social ladder.

645
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,960
It's aggrieving you.

646
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,520
I still have a son named Chang,

647
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,840
who I haven't found yet.

648
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,920
I told you this, right?

649
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,800
I know.

650
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,280
When I was proposing,

651
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,625
your grandmother really dug up the roots

652
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:11,120
and asked for the facts about it.

653
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,950
I repeatedly guaranteed her

654
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,270
that I won't let an illegitimate son

655
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,240
surpass a legitimate son.

656
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,600
Only then did she give her permission.

657
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,450
To care for another person's children

658
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:20,680
as one's own is indeed hard.

659
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,560
Don't blame my grandmother.

660
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,720
Of course, I won't.

661
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,080
But I don't want to hide it from you.

662
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,520
Chang is my son.

663
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,320
Even if I have to go to the ends of the world,

664
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,800
I must find him.

665
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,120
You should.

666
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,880
Now that we are married,

667
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,280
we have to be honest with each other.

668
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,120
I also know

669
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,520
that placing Rong

670
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,880
by your side will surely make you uncomfortable.

671
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,280
This is just normal human behavior.

672
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,040
However,

673
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,200
if you really feel so,

674
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,280
you must tell me.

675
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,600
A child is the flesh and blood of parents.

676
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,250
Being a legitimate or an illegitimate child

677
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:01,920
shouldn't affect that.

678
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,560
If you refuse to acknowledge these two children

679
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,040
just to cover up your past,

680
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,000
that is scarier.

681
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,440
We both have the same experience.

682
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,640
Now,

683
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,680
I'm someone's stepmother.

684
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,434
I will never let Rong

685
00:35:17,434 --> 00:35:19,440
walk the same path that I did.

686
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,360
my wife,

687
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,680
I thank you on behalf of my two children.

688
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,600
From now on,

689
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,440
if they are unfilial to you,

690
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,480
I surely will punish them.

691
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,120
If my father

692
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,640
is a father like you,

693
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,800
how great will that be.

694
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,800
I knew you are the right one to marry.

695
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,880
It's late.

696
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,200
We still have a major thing to do.

697
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,400
Then...

698
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,800
Then... I...

699
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,160
I'll go change my clothes first.

700
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,840
Why change?

701
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,350
That illegitimate daughter just

702
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:52,120
peacefully married into our house.

703
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,600
When we see the new bride tomorrow,

704
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,800
that scene will be amazing.

705
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,600
How come?

706
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,500
Every new bride has to suffer some hardships

707
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,730
when they meet her mother-in-law for the first time.

708
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,720
Tomorrow,

709
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,875
Big Madam can put out the bearing

710
00:37:13,875 --> 00:37:14,960
of a mother-in-law.

711
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,960
For a noble family like us,

712
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,520
when a new bride comes to our family,

713
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,320
we must treat her amicably.

714
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,680
Her family is also of lower status.

715
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,030
We mustn't scare her

716
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,240
with a few words.

717
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Forget it.

718
00:37:36,098 --> 00:37:40,178
Yes, I said too much.

719
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,720
Put in more strength.

720
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,120
What is that?

721
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,320
These are the assets

722
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,160
that my maternal grandfather left me.

723
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,160
Look.

724
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:12,800
A farmstead like this

725
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,200
can earn more than

726
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,600
one thousand in a year.

727
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,840
If it's a salt shop,

728
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,000
there will be more.

729
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,560
Too bad,

730
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,880
most of these assets are outside the capital.

731
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,240
There are also some in the capital,

732
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,160
but not that many.

733
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,450
I could also have a share

734
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:29,360
with the ones from the Gu Family,

735
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,280
but Big Madam and Eldest Brother have seized them.

736
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,400
I am also too lazy to contend for it.

737
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,040
I only have these left.

738
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,600
I'm entrusting them all to you.

739
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,680
What's wrong?

740
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,280
These are the dowry items my grandmother gave me.

741
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,325
I initially thought

742
00:39:05,325 --> 00:39:05,920
that these were already abundant.

743
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,160
these were already abundant.

744
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,560
But compared to yours...

745
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,320
I'm really from a small and not so wealthy family.

746
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:16,775
I fear that I'm unable to

747
00:39:16,775 --> 00:39:17,400
manage these huge assets of yours.

748
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,240
to manage these huge assets of yours.

749
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,680
Even if you can't, you must.

750
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,520
Who was born to be good at managing these?

751
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,520
With you being so smart,

752
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,920
don't tell me that you can't learn to do it.

753
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,440
Then I'll give it a try.

754
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,680
If I can't...

755
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:36,320
Even if you can't, you have to bear it.

756
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:39,160
I risked my life just to obtain these.

757
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,280
I must entrust them to you.

758
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,000
Risked your life?

759
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,480
You think that one risks his life

760
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,640
only on battlefields?

761
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,720
Isn't it the same at home?

762
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,480
This...

763
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:07,040
is the last will that I made when I went to

764
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,680
pay respect to my Bai ancestors in Yangzhou.

765
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,470
Are you saying that

766
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:11,800
it was the Bai family

767
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,400
who attempted to assassinate you?

768
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,160
Right.

769
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,125
If not because

770
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:19,795
I changed into my servant's clothes,

771
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,680
my corpse would be rotten

772
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,440
somewhere unknown now.

773
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,200
When I survived that ordeal,

774
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,280
I wrote a last will when I got home.

775
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,120
That is a good idea.

776
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,400
If you have an heir,

777
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,120
it will be useless

778
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,200
for the Bai family to kill you.

779
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,880
But you didn't write anything.

780
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,560
Isn't that so?

781
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,360
At the time,

782
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,480
I didn't have any dependable person worthy for me

783
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,760
to entrust my assets to.

784
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,600
Hence,

785
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,920
I could only seal a blank paper like that.

786
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,440
And then, I spread the news

787
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,520
that I had an heir already.

788
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,200
That made the Bai Family end any coveting ideas.

789
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,560
This is indeed better than having a real heir,

790
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,160
so that he won't be in danger

791
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,720
if the Bai family learns who he is.

792
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,760
Even so,

793
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,720
the Bai family didn't stop

794
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,120
bribing the people around me

795
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,640
They kept trying to know

796
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,120
who the heir is,

797
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,400
When I returned to the capital,

798
00:41:51,787 --> 00:41:53,025
although a lot of our old servants

799
00:41:53,025 --> 00:41:53,720
have been changed,

800
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,360
it can't be helped

801
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,025
for spies from the Bai family

802
00:41:56,025 --> 00:41:56,880
successfully infiltrating our manor.

803
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,120
In this manor，

804
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,200
other than Nanny Chang, Shitou,

805
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,000
and you,

806
00:42:05,174 --> 00:42:06,695
I don't have any other people to trust.

807
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,000
You really have lived a hard life.

808
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,240
This is heaven's will.

809
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,280
Letting two people with hard lives like us

810
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,600
become husband and wife.

811
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,880
As long as the two of us

812
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,000
have the same heart and morality,

813
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,600
no matter how huge the storms

814
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,840
that will come to us in the future,

815
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,600
we can survive it together.

816
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,200
I, Gu Tingye, swear to the heavens

817
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,160
that if I let Minglan down in this life,

818
00:42:57,390 --> 00:43:00,360
I will lose my official post and noble title,

819
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,160
and never get a chance to make a comeback.

820
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,560
I...

821
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,280
I...

822
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:17,730
I don't know what oath to make

823
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,880
to be worthy of the great trust you're giving me.

824
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,840
Come.

825
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,800
You don't need to make any oaths.

826
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,880
In the future, if you leave me,

827
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,000
it must be me who let you down

828
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,640
and break your heart.

829
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,320
Let's store these things first.

830
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,680
Don't bother,

831
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,080
The bed is so huge

832
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,320
that we have enough space to play.

833
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,150
The most important thing for tonight

834
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:11,160
has not be done yet.

835
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,800
If it's not done well, it will be ominous.
