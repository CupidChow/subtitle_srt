00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,928
Episode 24

3
00:01:05,485 --> 00:01:06,485
These days here in Youyang

4
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:07,725
are so comfortable.

5
00:01:07,725 --> 00:01:08,925
I almost feel it's unbearable to leave.

6
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,405
Is Youyang nice?

7
00:01:12,965 --> 00:01:13,925
Of course it's nice.

8
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:16,645
Our Sheng House, what isn't good about it?

9
00:01:17,325 --> 00:01:19,005
The people are nice and the place is nice too.

10
00:01:21,485 --> 00:01:22,885
Speaking of people,

11
00:01:23,965 --> 00:01:25,285
the girl Pinlan

12
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:26,405
is easy-mannered.

13
00:01:28,845 --> 00:01:30,205
What about the one in He House?

14
00:01:33,285 --> 00:01:35,845
The elder brother of the He House is a nice person.

15
00:01:36,485 --> 00:01:37,405
How is he nice?

16
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:41,285
He's older than we are by some years

17
00:01:41,285 --> 00:01:43,285
and he's gentle and friendly,

18
00:01:44,205 --> 00:01:45,525
always looking after us.

19
00:01:45,765 --> 00:01:47,845
That's what an older brother should do though.

20
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,285
That's not really worth mentioning.

21
00:01:52,005 --> 00:01:53,005
Is there anything else?

22
00:01:59,525 --> 00:02:01,325
I think

23
00:02:01,325 --> 00:02:02,845
what makes Brother He most precious

24
00:02:03,765 --> 00:02:06,245
is that he understands it's hard to be a woman.

25
00:02:07,845 --> 00:02:09,605
I think someone

26
00:02:09,605 --> 00:02:10,885
who can

27
00:02:11,205 --> 00:02:12,685
sigh for the women of the world

28
00:02:12,685 --> 00:02:14,085
must be a good person.

29
00:02:15,285 --> 00:02:17,485
His father died early,

30
00:02:17,485 --> 00:02:18,925
and his mother is sickly and weak.

31
00:02:19,965 --> 00:02:21,005
The family all depends on

32
00:02:21,005 --> 00:02:22,245
the grandmother to hold it up.

33
00:02:22,445 --> 00:02:23,805
Since he was little

34
00:02:23,805 --> 00:02:25,685
he's witnessed his grandmother's hardship.

35
00:02:26,805 --> 00:02:27,405
This nourished his mature

36
00:02:27,445 --> 00:02:29,605
and realistic temperament,

37
00:02:29,925 --> 00:02:31,445
Always being considerate of others.

38
00:02:32,325 --> 00:02:34,125
And his clan passes down medical skills,

39
00:02:34,805 --> 00:02:36,445
so he does indeed have some skills.

40
00:02:38,885 --> 00:02:40,685
If one can marry a husband like him,

41
00:02:41,805 --> 00:02:42,645
her whole life

42
00:02:43,765 --> 00:02:45,445
could be peaceful and secure,

43
00:02:46,285 --> 00:02:47,325
easy and comfortable.

44
00:02:49,925 --> 00:02:51,245
Yes.

45
00:02:53,165 --> 00:02:54,525
Brother He

46
00:02:54,525 --> 00:02:56,245
deserves someone who is fully honest

47
00:02:56,325 --> 00:02:57,685
and committed to him to spend the days together,

48
00:02:58,485 --> 00:03:01,565
and truly devoted to being with him.

49
00:03:02,445 --> 00:03:03,685
That's his luck.

50
00:03:07,805 --> 00:03:08,965
And you?

51
00:03:10,365 --> 00:03:13,045
Me? I...

52
00:03:14,885 --> 00:03:16,685
I think mine's not here yet.

53
00:03:20,205 --> 00:03:21,045
I fear it is

54
00:03:22,445 --> 00:03:23,285
and you just don't know it yet.

55
00:04:05,325 --> 00:04:06,605
Shoot the arrows.

56
00:05:07,285 --> 00:05:08,765
Attack.

57
00:05:08,765 --> 00:05:10,285
Attack!

58
00:05:15,965 --> 00:05:16,725
Guards!

59
00:05:18,365 --> 00:05:19,325
Guards!

60
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:34,005
There is an ambush! Scatter!

61
00:06:04,605 --> 00:06:05,885
Release the arrows!

62
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:48,885
Attack!

63
00:06:52,325 --> 00:06:53,325
Hurry!

64
00:07:20,725 --> 00:07:21,885
Young Master.

65
00:07:22,765 --> 00:07:24,085
Our ambush!

66
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:26,045
Their chief's already dead.

67
00:07:30,085 --> 00:07:31,685
Let's hurry and congratulate our Great General Xie.

68
00:07:31,925 --> 00:07:33,565
He used a closed-gate ambush to

69
00:07:33,565 --> 00:07:35,245
capture the enemy. How sage!

70
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,285
Yes, Young Master.

71
00:07:42,525 --> 00:07:43,445
General Xie!

72
00:07:44,485 --> 00:07:49,125
General,

73
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:49,845
you are brilliant!

74
00:07:50,005 --> 00:07:52,405
Brilliant! Brilliant!

75
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:56,125
The General is brilliant!

76
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,085
That Bai Ye is a true talent.

77
00:08:03,445 --> 00:08:05,245
If you keep him by your side,

78
00:08:05,565 --> 00:08:06,405
he will be your wing

79
00:08:06,405 --> 00:08:07,685
to help you soar.

80
00:08:08,845 --> 00:08:09,645
What did you say?

81
00:08:11,605 --> 00:08:13,125
General, you're the one to soar above the clouds.

82
00:08:14,565 --> 00:08:16,805
Of course I will soar above the clouds.

83
00:08:17,485 --> 00:08:18,925
This group of

84
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,445
treacherous renegades

85
00:08:20,645 --> 00:08:21,569
is the royal court's trouble

86
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:22,405
of scabies and ringworm.

87
00:08:22,965 --> 00:08:23,885
As for me,

88
00:08:24,525 --> 00:08:25,565
and I'm the medicine to cure the disease.

89
00:08:26,525 --> 00:08:28,005
Other places?

90
00:08:28,005 --> 00:08:29,033
Is there anyone else who could

91
00:08:29,033 --> 00:08:30,085
have such a brilliant strategy?

92
00:08:31,405 --> 00:08:31,965
Of course.

93
00:08:34,205 --> 00:08:36,725
Think. Think. I am truly . . .

94
00:08:36,925 --> 00:08:38,565
I am truly a talent.

95
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:40,727
I knew clearly the enemy force would

96
00:08:40,727 --> 00:08:41,965
raid in the middle of the night.

97
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,245
So I just let them go

98
00:08:44,245 --> 00:08:46,445
lured the enemy in deep,

99
00:08:47,085 --> 00:08:48,156
and closed the gate for the capture.

100
00:08:48,156 --> 00:08:48,765
This great strategy.

101
00:08:50,445 --> 00:08:51,165
Right?

102
00:08:55,645 --> 00:08:57,565
If someone delivers false military orders,

103
00:08:58,725 --> 00:09:01,965
he should be beheaded.

104
00:09:01,965 --> 00:09:02,565
Right?

105
00:09:04,965 --> 00:09:06,045
The General is right.

106
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,485
Then what do we write

107
00:09:07,525 --> 00:09:08,325
about that Bai Ye?

108
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,485
What do you mean saying what do we write?

109
00:09:10,965 --> 00:09:12,805
He is only a night patrolman.

110
00:09:13,365 --> 00:09:14,525
You know how we write about him.

111
00:09:15,685 --> 00:09:18,045
Slowly. Walk slowly. Walk slowly.

112
00:09:18,045 --> 00:09:18,685
Slowly.

113
00:09:18,805 --> 00:09:21,165
No, no, no, don't rush.

114
00:09:21,285 --> 00:09:22,845
Hurry. Pull up your strength.

115
00:09:22,845 --> 00:09:24,605
Pull up your strength. Slower.

116
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:29,645
Hurry, hurry, hurry. You pull up

117
00:09:29,645 --> 00:09:30,365
your strength and carry.

118
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:33,965
Slower. Don't rush.

119
00:09:33,965 --> 00:09:34,645
I‘ll help you.

120
00:09:35,085 --> 00:09:35,645
Come, let me help you.

121
00:09:38,285 --> 00:09:39,285
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

122
00:09:41,365 --> 00:09:42,125
Hurry, go.

123
00:09:43,725 --> 00:09:45,045
It's all up to you now.

124
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,365
Drink, drink.

125
00:09:48,485 --> 00:09:51,285
Drink a lot and eat a lot.

126
00:09:51,445 --> 00:09:52,285
Mother-in-law, come sit and rest. Alright.

127
00:09:55,085 --> 00:09:57,005
How is it?

128
00:09:57,005 --> 00:09:58,245
Eat a lot.

129
00:09:59,045 --> 00:10:00,965
Eat and drink up.

130
00:10:00,965 --> 00:10:01,805
A great happy event.

131
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,365
We'll all celebrate together.

132
00:10:07,165 --> 00:10:08,885
Alright. Alright.

133
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,645
Madam, the son-in-law young lord drank too much.

134
00:10:11,685 --> 00:10:13,605
He's causing a ruckus outside.

135
00:10:16,205 --> 00:10:17,285
It's just too busy today.

136
00:10:17,645 --> 00:10:18,565
Brother Changwu

137
00:10:18,565 --> 00:10:19,285
will come see you soon.

138
00:10:20,045 --> 00:10:21,245
He'll come and drink with you.

139
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:22,725
Son-in-law,

140
00:10:23,725 --> 00:10:24,685
come on down.

141
00:10:26,805 --> 00:10:27,365
My son.

142
00:10:28,245 --> 00:10:29,205
What's happened?

143
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,325
Old turd!

144
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,285
You dare to coax me?

145
00:10:35,405 --> 00:10:36,645
Come on down. Don't fall now!

146
00:10:36,965 --> 00:10:37,805
You clearly

147
00:10:39,085 --> 00:10:41,485
treat me, this scholar husband badly!

148
00:10:43,085 --> 00:10:44,445
You treat me badly.

149
00:10:46,085 --> 00:10:47,885
That's an insult to culture!

150
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,525
Mother-in-law.

151
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,845
You will need to go to court

152
00:10:54,165 --> 00:10:55,725
and get flogged!

153
00:11:00,325 --> 00:11:02,125
He was fine yesterday.

154
00:11:02,525 --> 00:11:03,605
He even told me

155
00:11:03,685 --> 00:11:05,045
the good news that

156
00:11:05,045 --> 00:11:05,885
his mistress outside is pregnant.

157
00:11:06,245 --> 00:11:07,685
Why is he now like this today?

158
00:11:08,685 --> 00:11:10,605
Did you anger him?

159
00:11:10,805 --> 00:11:11,805
Mother-in-law, I dare not.

160
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:12,765
Was it you?

161
00:11:12,925 --> 00:11:14,445
Okay. Okay.

162
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:15,725
This is a joyous occasion.

163
00:11:16,525 --> 00:11:18,805
If grandnephew-in-law wants to drink,

164
00:11:18,805 --> 00:11:19,885
just let him.

165
00:11:20,245 --> 00:11:21,525
Once he has drunk enough,

166
00:11:21,525 --> 00:11:23,405
his anger will dissipate.

167
00:11:25,605 --> 00:11:26,649
Aren't you complaining that

168
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:27,765
no one's drinking with you?

169
00:11:28,805 --> 00:11:30,165
Grandniece.

170
00:11:30,165 --> 00:11:30,805
I'm here.

171
00:11:31,045 --> 00:11:33,685
Go and tell my nephew

172
00:11:34,045 --> 00:11:35,165
to come here and entertain

173
00:11:35,165 --> 00:11:37,605
our distinguished guest well!

174
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:39,765
The Xiucai

175
00:11:40,005 --> 00:11:42,565
is like my deceased husband,

176
00:11:42,565 --> 00:11:44,445
a very noble status!

177
00:11:45,685 --> 00:11:47,925
Everyone must serve him.

178
00:11:48,405 --> 00:11:49,685
Come, come, everyone!

179
00:11:50,325 --> 00:11:51,765
Those who still can, and even those who can't!

180
00:11:52,925 --> 00:11:54,205
Magistrates, all of you,

181
00:11:54,205 --> 00:11:55,685
come here to toast him.

182
00:11:55,805 --> 00:11:56,525
Thank you. Thank you.

183
00:11:56,525 --> 00:11:58,035
This is the proper etiquette

184
00:11:58,035 --> 00:11:59,285
in attending to a guest.

185
00:12:00,325 --> 00:12:01,925
No. No.

186
00:12:02,605 --> 00:12:04,125
If each one toasts him with so many people here,

187
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,445
he surely will get drunk!

188
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:19,605
Miss.

189
00:12:21,085 --> 00:12:22,525
First House's Old Madam and our own Old Madam

190
00:12:22,525 --> 00:12:23,605
ask to see you.

191
00:12:24,205 --> 00:12:25,485
At this late at night,

192
00:12:25,485 --> 00:12:26,525
did something happen again?

193
00:12:27,285 --> 00:12:28,325
Old Madam said

194
00:12:28,325 --> 00:12:29,400
that you should go there and look.

195
00:12:29,485 --> 00:12:30,725
Go and look at the winds and waves.

196
00:12:30,725 --> 00:12:31,885
Meet the leopards and wolves of the mortal world.

197
00:12:34,485 --> 00:12:36,165
I know that you're filial.

198
00:12:37,805 --> 00:12:39,005
You don't want me

199
00:12:39,045 --> 00:12:40,245
to see those messy things.

200
00:12:41,565 --> 00:12:42,845
I also want to

201
00:12:42,885 --> 00:12:44,445
pretend to be deaf and mute,

202
00:12:45,805 --> 00:12:47,805
and allow you to practice your filial piety.

203
00:12:49,725 --> 00:12:52,005
But do you want to

204
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:53,805
get tormented to death,

205
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:55,565
and then just tell me

206
00:12:55,565 --> 00:12:57,245
your grievances through my dreams?

207
00:13:04,525 --> 00:13:07,725
Mother, I'll go handle it.

208
00:13:10,285 --> 00:13:12,405
I already told you a few months ago

209
00:13:12,845 --> 00:13:15,245
that you should go think about a back-up plan.

210
00:13:15,845 --> 00:13:17,125
What did you come up with?

211
00:13:19,405 --> 00:13:21,245
You sent them another two shops.

212
00:13:22,925 --> 00:13:24,445
If I allow you to handle this again,

213
00:13:25,445 --> 00:13:27,485
you'll just use money to earn the good favor

214
00:13:27,485 --> 00:13:29,605
of that grandson-in-law of mine.

215
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:33,485
When he caused trouble once before,

216
00:13:33,485 --> 00:13:35,205
he got two shops.

217
00:13:35,525 --> 00:13:36,925
If he does it again,

218
00:13:36,925 --> 00:13:38,605
he'll get another two shops?

219
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:41,165
You're giving him money too easily.

220
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,565
Not just him,

221
00:13:43,565 --> 00:13:45,125
even I want to cause trouble.

222
00:13:46,045 --> 00:13:48,125
It's hard to

223
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,805
satisfy insatiable greed.

224
00:13:51,605 --> 00:13:53,365
I'm thinking that they are

225
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,565
legal husband and wife after all.

226
00:13:57,245 --> 00:13:58,445
He has already wasted

227
00:13:58,445 --> 00:14:00,085
half of your daughter's dowry.

228
00:14:01,565 --> 00:14:03,445
He also now

229
00:14:03,445 --> 00:14:05,365
has several dozens of concubines.

230
00:14:05,885 --> 00:14:07,525
What else is he not satisfied with?

231
00:14:10,605 --> 00:14:12,405
Mother-in-law told me not to

232
00:14:12,405 --> 00:14:14,205
disturb my husband from studying.

233
00:14:15,165 --> 00:14:16,685
She wants me to stay in her room

234
00:14:16,725 --> 00:14:18,045
and attend to her.

235
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,285
This past month,

236
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,885
we rarely slept together.

237
00:14:28,685 --> 00:14:29,885
Afterwards,

238
00:14:31,645 --> 00:14:32,845
she told me that being unable

239
00:14:32,885 --> 00:14:33,845
to bear any descendants is an unfilial act.

240
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:37,445
I then got him concubines.

241
00:14:38,885 --> 00:14:40,325
But he complained that those concubines

242
00:14:40,325 --> 00:14:41,245
are too uninteresting.

243
00:14:43,205 --> 00:14:45,245
He then

244
00:14:45,245 --> 00:14:46,805
housed a prostitute outside.

245
00:14:49,005 --> 00:14:50,565
When that prostitute got pregnant,

246
00:14:51,845 --> 00:14:52,965
Husband and Mother-in-law insist

247
00:14:52,965 --> 00:14:54,405
that she be allowed in our house.

248
00:14:56,685 --> 00:14:57,325
I said

249
00:14:59,645 --> 00:15:01,165
that our family has ancestral teachings

250
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,395
that we won't live in the same house

251
00:15:04,395 --> 00:15:05,245
with prostitutes.

252
00:15:05,245 --> 00:15:05,725
that we won't live in the same house with prostitutes.

253
00:15:06,845 --> 00:15:07,405
He

254
00:15:09,365 --> 00:15:10,845
then hit me.

255
00:15:18,205 --> 00:15:19,845
They are bullying us intolerably!

256
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,085
Tomorrow,

257
00:15:23,085 --> 00:15:24,845
I'll personally go to their Sun Manor.

258
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:27,525
I'm going to reason it out with him!

259
00:15:28,725 --> 00:15:30,205
This also

260
00:15:30,205 --> 00:15:31,565
isn't their fault.

261
00:15:32,725 --> 00:15:34,125
Only after three years of marriage

262
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,565
did he get his first child.

263
00:15:36,445 --> 00:15:37,452
It's just natural for them

264
00:15:37,452 --> 00:15:38,781
to treat that child so preciously.

265
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:43,365
If you go, you'll just get humiliated.

266
00:15:44,925 --> 00:15:45,485
This

267
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:47,805
can't be

268
00:15:47,805 --> 00:15:49,445
blamed on Shu'er.

269
00:15:50,165 --> 00:15:52,085
Shu'er was only

270
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:53,005
able to sleep with that

271
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:54,805
useless Xiucai three to five times a year.

272
00:15:55,045 --> 00:15:56,565
She can't really have a child

273
00:15:56,565 --> 00:15:57,445
out of nowhere, right?

274
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:01,525
Mother, what should we do?

275
00:16:02,365 --> 00:16:03,605
What should we do?

276
00:16:06,285 --> 00:16:07,525
I don't know.

277
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,165
Shu,

278
00:16:16,325 --> 00:16:17,885
tell me the truth.

279
00:16:19,725 --> 00:16:23,965
If I'm willing to bear losing some good karma,

280
00:16:24,325 --> 00:16:26,005
to get my hand dirtied with blood

281
00:16:26,005 --> 00:16:27,245
just to fulfill your wish,

282
00:16:28,205 --> 00:16:29,605
are you willing to

283
00:16:31,245 --> 00:16:33,525
raise that prostitute's child

284
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:34,445
as your own,

285
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,925
just so you can continue

286
00:16:36,925 --> 00:16:38,045
staying in the House of Sun?

287
00:16:38,925 --> 00:16:41,565
This way, you'll still have a husband.

288
00:16:50,325 --> 00:16:51,525
I don't know.

289
00:16:52,925 --> 00:16:55,645
I don't know! I don't know!

290
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:01,725
Open your eyes and look.

291
00:17:02,885 --> 00:17:04,805
She's your own daughter.

292
00:17:05,805 --> 00:17:08,365
With a mother-in-law and husband like that

293
00:17:08,365 --> 00:17:09,525
from the House of Sun,

294
00:17:10,565 --> 00:17:11,805
how could she bear to live with them

295
00:17:11,805 --> 00:17:13,725
for the next decades?

296
00:17:17,085 --> 00:17:17,605
Shu'er

297
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:21,045
How could I bear to slight my Shu'er.

298
00:17:21,045 --> 00:17:22,205
She's flesh from my own body.

299
00:17:22,245 --> 00:17:23,485
She's flesh from my own body.

300
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:27,125
Just one wrong observation

301
00:17:27,165 --> 00:17:28,845
and I've lost it all.

302
00:17:29,205 --> 00:17:30,845
If the Sheng Family

303
00:17:31,045 --> 00:17:31,885
has a daughter that gets divorced,

304
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,845
has a daughter that gets divorced,

305
00:17:34,085 --> 00:17:35,605
what about the other ladies in our family

306
00:17:35,605 --> 00:17:37,805
that haven't been married yet?

307
00:17:38,365 --> 00:17:40,685
And my girl Pin,

308
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:41,965
she doesn't even have any marriage agreement yet.

309
00:17:42,565 --> 00:17:43,805
If no one take her,

310
00:17:43,845 --> 00:17:44,885
what then?

311
00:17:54,525 --> 00:17:55,485
Ming.

312
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,805
Ming, shut up.

313
00:18:02,445 --> 00:18:03,445
Grandmother,

314
00:18:03,645 --> 00:18:05,165
for Sister Yanran,

315
00:18:05,165 --> 00:18:07,045
I could run to the front line and fought.

316
00:18:07,805 --> 00:18:09,845
This is about my biological cousin.

317
00:18:10,765 --> 00:18:12,605
I can't shut up,

318
00:18:12,605 --> 00:18:13,565
and I don't want to shut up.

319
00:18:17,285 --> 00:18:19,205
Child, get up.

320
00:18:21,645 --> 00:18:23,205
Do you have any good ideas?

321
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:27,845
None

322
00:18:29,165 --> 00:18:29,949
Dynasties can easily change,

323
00:18:29,949 --> 00:18:30,685
but human character can't.

324
00:18:31,645 --> 00:18:32,405
If that Xiucai Sun

325
00:18:33,085 --> 00:18:34,405
doesn't meet any great calamity

326
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:35,125
that endangers his life,

327
00:18:35,445 --> 00:18:36,925
he will never change that bad attitude of his.

328
00:18:39,005 --> 00:18:41,538
With one wrong step,

329
00:18:41,565 --> 00:18:42,765
Sister Shulan has already entered a blind alley.

330
00:18:45,965 --> 00:18:47,085
Since that's the case,

331
00:18:47,965 --> 00:18:49,285
what do you want to say?

332
00:18:51,285 --> 00:18:52,485
Since it's a blind alley,

333
00:18:52,485 --> 00:18:53,965
she should turn around immediately.

334
00:18:55,925 --> 00:18:56,963
She mustn't wait until her whole lifetime

335
00:18:56,963 --> 00:18:57,525
has been spent in regret.

336
00:18:57,525 --> 00:18:58,525
when it will be too late.

337
00:19:02,845 --> 00:19:05,605
Sister Pinlan has a straightforward attitude

338
00:19:05,605 --> 00:19:06,925
a magnanimous bearing.

339
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:08,245
She surely won't agree to use

340
00:19:08,285 --> 00:19:09,155
the bones of Sister Shulan

341
00:19:09,205 --> 00:19:10,085
as a stepping stone into

342
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,445
marrying into a noble family.

343
00:19:13,005 --> 00:19:14,765
Once Sister Pinlan gets married off,

344
00:19:14,965 --> 00:19:16,685
if the family of her husband sees

345
00:19:16,685 --> 00:19:17,686
how harsh her sister is being treated

346
00:19:17,686 --> 00:19:18,085
by her in-laws,

347
00:19:18,245 --> 00:19:20,205
while the Sheng family is enduring everything,

348
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:21,205
won't they

349
00:19:21,205 --> 00:19:22,725
develop intentions

350
00:19:22,925 --> 00:19:24,245
to slight Sister Pinlan too and the Sheng family?

351
00:19:29,245 --> 00:19:29,925
I'm saying these words

352
00:19:29,965 --> 00:19:31,965
not for Sister Shulan,

353
00:19:31,965 --> 00:19:33,405
it's also for the sake of Sister Pinlan.

354
00:19:35,165 --> 00:19:37,725
What if my girl Pin doesn't get married off

355
00:19:37,725 --> 00:19:38,965
to a good family because of this?

356
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:42,645
A person can only live for decades,

357
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:44,565
while a clan can exist for hundreds of years.

358
00:19:45,005 --> 00:19:46,645
There will be no end

359
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:47,645
in the change of government.

360
00:19:48,965 --> 00:19:50,245
If relatives can't subdue themselves,

361
00:19:50,245 --> 00:19:50,885
observe proprieties

362
00:19:50,885 --> 00:19:52,165
and live through times together hand in hand,

363
00:19:52,645 --> 00:19:53,706
everything you're managing now

364
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:55,285
will just become dreamlike illusions

365
00:19:55,605 --> 00:19:56,845
and will be gone in an instant.

366
00:19:59,245 --> 00:20:00,161
If the family of the marriage prospect

367
00:20:00,161 --> 00:20:00,557
of Sister Pinlan

368
00:20:00,565 --> 00:20:01,965
can't see through the character of the House of Sun,

369
00:20:02,725 --> 00:20:04,085
their character and intelligence

370
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,525
are indeed worrisome.

371
00:20:06,365 --> 00:20:07,485
If things capsize,

372
00:20:07,485 --> 00:20:09,325
who will protect Sister Pin?

373
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,125
Then it means that

374
00:20:15,525 --> 00:20:17,365
if Pin doesn't get married off,

375
00:20:17,365 --> 00:20:18,845
it's just fine?

376
00:20:22,485 --> 00:20:23,485
It's no big deal

377
00:20:23,485 --> 00:20:24,245
if I never get married off!

378
00:20:27,805 --> 00:20:29,125
Marriage fate is set by the heavens.

379
00:20:29,445 --> 00:20:30,845
If I have that fortune

380
00:20:30,845 --> 00:20:32,085
even if Eldest Sister gets divorced,

381
00:20:32,325 --> 00:20:33,405
I surely will find that suitable man.

382
00:20:33,725 --> 00:20:36,085
If I'm to have an extravagant betrothal gift

383
00:20:36,325 --> 00:20:37,682
in exchange for Sister getting tormented to death

384
00:20:37,685 --> 00:20:38,525
in that lair of tigers and wolves,

385
00:20:38,765 --> 00:20:40,445
I don't care about this

386
00:20:40,485 --> 00:20:41,365
lifetime of glory then!

387
00:20:42,565 --> 00:20:43,805
Mother,

388
00:20:44,445 --> 00:20:45,805
if you're afraid of dragging me into trouble,

389
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,165
I'll go cover my head and go up the mountain

390
00:20:47,165 --> 00:20:48,245
to become a nun by tomorrow.

391
00:20:48,885 --> 00:20:50,285
Mother,

392
00:20:50,325 --> 00:20:51,485
leave Sister a path to survive.

393
00:20:56,285 --> 00:20:57,165
Child.

394
00:21:06,805 --> 00:21:08,925
Come, good child.

395
00:21:11,285 --> 00:21:12,325
Mother.

396
00:21:16,885 --> 00:21:18,045
Stop crying.

397
00:21:18,925 --> 00:21:20,208
You all are crying as if

398
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,725
the sky would fall down.

399
00:21:21,725 --> 00:21:22,645
Those who doesn't know

400
00:21:22,925 --> 00:21:23,869
might think that our Sheng family

401
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:24,525
wasn't having a wedding

402
00:21:24,525 --> 00:21:26,245
but a funeral instead.

403
00:21:28,605 --> 00:21:29,365
Divorce?

404
00:21:30,645 --> 00:21:31,765
Dream on!

405
00:21:33,565 --> 00:21:34,725
They can only separate amicably.

406
00:21:40,205 --> 00:21:41,445
Leave! Leave!

407
00:21:41,445 --> 00:21:41,925
Hear me out.

408
00:21:42,085 --> 00:21:44,325
Leave! Leave!

409
00:21:45,005 --> 00:21:45,525
No

410
00:21:45,885 --> 00:21:46,525
Go on, go!

411
00:21:46,525 --> 00:21:47,845
Who's separating amicably with you!

412
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,125
Must I still pretend to be nice

413
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:50,965
with your Sheng family!

414
00:21:52,485 --> 00:21:54,085
That shameless and unfilial jealous wife

415
00:21:54,405 --> 00:21:55,765
only deserves a divorce letter from me

416
00:21:55,765 --> 00:21:56,485
and to be expelled out of our house!

417
00:21:57,365 --> 00:21:58,565
Doesn't know what's good for her!

418
00:21:58,565 --> 00:21:59,565
A black-hearted ingrate!

419
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:02,325
Just because her family has some money,

420
00:22:02,325 --> 00:22:03,146
she dares to behave atrociously

421
00:22:03,146 --> 00:22:04,125
in the house of her Xiucai husband.

422
00:22:05,485 --> 00:22:06,765
Everyone, come and look!

423
00:22:06,885 --> 00:22:09,525
Come and look! This is the good house teachings

424
00:22:10,005 --> 00:22:11,205
of the rich Sheng clan of our Youyang!

425
00:22:11,685 --> 00:22:13,365
Their own daughter was unable to bear any child!

426
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:14,555
Now that my son's concubine

427
00:22:14,555 --> 00:22:15,285
was able to get pregnant,

428
00:22:15,885 --> 00:22:17,186
she's hiding in her maiden clan's house

429
00:22:17,186 --> 00:22:18,045
and refuses to come back.

430
00:22:18,325 --> 00:22:19,318
Unfilial to her mother-in-law.

431
00:22:19,318 --> 00:22:20,165
Not serving her husband!

432
00:22:20,565 --> 00:22:23,125
She's even using the excuse of amicable separation

433
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:24,925
to blackmail her in-laws.

434
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:26,765
Bullshit!

435
00:22:27,765 --> 00:22:28,885
Madam Sun,

436
00:22:28,885 --> 00:22:30,205
you should talk reasonably.

437
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:31,795
When your Sheng daughter-in-law

438
00:22:31,795 --> 00:22:32,725
married into your house,

439
00:22:32,725 --> 00:22:33,965
that's the time your family was able to become rich.

440
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,725
Have you forgotten your pitiful appearance

441
00:22:35,725 --> 00:22:37,325
of washing clothes to live by?

442
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:38,365
Leave! Leave!

443
00:22:40,285 --> 00:22:41,565
What do you know?

444
00:22:41,565 --> 00:22:43,205
My son is a Xiucai!

445
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,045
He will bring me wealth, status, glory,

446
00:22:45,085 --> 00:22:45,925
and splendor in the future to enjoy!

447
00:22:46,005 --> 00:22:47,165
How is that a blessing

448
00:22:47,205 --> 00:22:47,800
from that little bitch?

449
00:22:47,805 --> 00:22:48,845
Mother! Mother!

450
00:22:49,045 --> 00:22:50,205
Stop lowering yourself to their level.

451
00:22:50,685 --> 00:22:51,845
It will degrade your refined status.

452
00:22:53,485 --> 00:22:54,525
You! Go back

453
00:22:54,525 --> 00:22:55,725
and tell the House of Sheng,

454
00:22:56,365 --> 00:22:56,996
if that Sheng Shulan will

455
00:22:56,996 --> 00:22:57,605
obediently come back here,

456
00:22:57,645 --> 00:22:59,165
kowtow and admit her mistake,

457
00:22:59,205 --> 00:23:00,245
and be a virtuous wife from then on,

458
00:23:00,965 --> 00:23:01,405
Not that.

459
00:23:01,445 --> 00:23:02,245
Our Sun family

460
00:23:03,765 --> 00:23:05,005
will still provide her food to eat.

461
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:06,085
Leave!

462
00:23:06,925 --> 00:23:07,565
Leave!

463
00:23:08,325 --> 00:23:09,005
Leave!

464
00:23:13,805 --> 00:23:14,600
Damn it.

465
00:23:21,365 --> 00:23:22,525
Looks like

466
00:23:23,765 --> 00:23:25,325
they won't ever

467
00:23:25,365 --> 00:23:26,325
let Eldest Miss go.

468
00:23:28,245 --> 00:23:29,205
Don't be upset.

469
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:31,365
With such a measly matter,

470
00:23:32,405 --> 00:23:33,605
we surely can handle it.

471
00:23:34,645 --> 00:23:35,885
Go and rest first.

472
00:23:45,485 --> 00:23:46,565
That kind of wolf

473
00:23:46,805 --> 00:23:47,845
is afraid of might and not kindness.

474
00:23:48,005 --> 00:23:49,165
We should find some strong and buff men

475
00:23:49,205 --> 00:23:50,365
among the people working for our lands

476
00:23:50,405 --> 00:23:51,805
to beat him up.

477
00:23:52,165 --> 00:23:53,005
He surely will behave afterwards,

478
00:23:53,325 --> 00:23:54,605
and write

479
00:23:54,645 --> 00:23:55,445
whatever we ask him to write!

480
00:23:56,045 --> 00:23:57,125
What nonsense are you saying?

481
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,365
Although that were indeed nonsense,

482
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:05,965
I am at ease.

483
00:24:06,735 --> 00:24:09,365
You are indeed an unruly child.

484
00:24:09,765 --> 00:24:11,405
I won't worry for you getting

485
00:24:11,405 --> 00:24:13,125
taken advantage of in this life.

486
00:24:17,405 --> 00:24:18,285
Ming,

487
00:24:19,485 --> 00:24:21,165
after hearing your words last time,

488
00:24:22,005 --> 00:24:23,325
I find it very reasonable.

489
00:24:24,605 --> 00:24:26,045
Now that we're faced with this predicament,

490
00:24:27,565 --> 00:24:28,965
what should we do?

491
00:24:36,445 --> 00:24:37,231
Rather than trying to stop water from boiling over

492
00:24:37,231 --> 00:24:37,925
by scooping it up and pouring it back in,

493
00:24:38,565 --> 00:24:39,151
it's better to just take away

494
00:24:39,151 --> 00:24:39,925
the firewood from under the cauldron.

495
00:24:42,205 --> 00:24:43,405
What do you mean?

496
00:24:45,325 --> 00:24:46,565
Tell them

497
00:24:47,565 --> 00:24:48,321
that if they don't cooperate

498
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:49,085
with an amicable separation,

499
00:24:49,925 --> 00:24:51,685
then they will

500
00:24:51,685 --> 00:24:53,845
never get any of the items

501
00:24:54,605 --> 00:24:55,485
that Sister Shulan brought to their house.

502
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:00,485
Look at that.

503
00:25:01,765 --> 00:25:04,365
That is what a house steward should be like.

504
00:25:07,565 --> 00:25:08,565
Maid Bian!

505
00:25:10,245 --> 00:25:11,205
Maid Bian!

506
00:25:13,085 --> 00:25:14,405
Maid Bian, where did you go?

507
00:25:16,005 --> 00:25:17,045
Maid Bian!

508
00:25:19,845 --> 00:25:21,565
Big Madam wants to eat some bird's nest.

509
00:25:21,565 --> 00:25:23,005
Quickly instruct someone to buy it.

510
00:25:24,605 --> 00:25:26,485
Big Madam has already returned to the Sheng family.

511
00:25:26,685 --> 00:25:27,845
Where did another

512
00:25:27,845 --> 00:25:28,725
Big Madam come from?

513
00:25:31,565 --> 00:25:32,965
You dare

514
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:33,805
talk to my mother like that?

515
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:36,965
Good thing the Xiucai knows that we all

516
00:25:36,965 --> 00:25:38,685
are servants from the Sheng family.

517
00:25:39,085 --> 00:25:40,252
Now that someone from their family

518
00:25:40,252 --> 00:25:41,125
is calling us to go back

519
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:42,136
it's far better than being separated

520
00:25:42,136 --> 00:25:42,725
from our loved ones,

521
00:25:43,045 --> 00:25:44,285
we'll be resigning and leaving today.

522
00:25:45,245 --> 00:25:46,125
Stop right there!

523
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:47,485
This is totally preposterous!

524
00:25:49,645 --> 00:25:50,605
You all

525
00:25:52,485 --> 00:25:53,405
If you all

526
00:25:54,245 --> 00:25:56,405
dare to leave our house by even half a step today,

527
00:25:57,045 --> 00:25:57,965
I'll see you

528
00:25:58,005 --> 00:25:58,950
all at the local magistrate!

529
00:25:59,005 --> 00:25:59,450
That's right!

530
00:25:59,485 --> 00:26:00,121
I'll sue you for the crime

531
00:26:00,121 --> 00:26:00,805
of escaping from your master!

532
00:26:02,325 --> 00:26:03,245
The master we went to serve

533
00:26:03,285 --> 00:26:04,805
is the House of Sheng,

534
00:26:04,925 --> 00:26:06,005
and not your Sun Family.

535
00:26:06,365 --> 00:26:07,205
In our contracts, the name written

536
00:26:07,205 --> 00:26:08,885
is that of the House of Sheng.

537
00:26:09,685 --> 00:26:12,245
On official papers,

538
00:26:12,245 --> 00:26:13,685
it's clearly written in black on white.

539
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:16,285
If you want to file a complaint, then go ahead!

540
00:26:16,645 --> 00:26:17,725
Let's go!

541
00:26:19,085 --> 00:26:19,685
Stop right there!

542
00:26:20,085 --> 00:26:20,925
All of you stop!

543
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:23,485
Stop! Stop!

544
00:26:23,485 --> 00:26:24,005
Okay.

545
00:26:24,045 --> 00:26:24,525
Stop!

546
00:26:25,205 --> 00:26:26,645
Stop! All of you, stop!

547
00:26:26,645 --> 00:26:27,565
Mother!

548
00:26:27,565 --> 00:26:27,925
Stop!

549
00:26:28,685 --> 00:26:29,205
Mother!

550
00:26:30,165 --> 00:26:31,645
That's being uncultured.

551
00:26:31,885 --> 00:26:33,365
This is revolting!

552
00:26:33,445 --> 00:26:34,445
Let them leave!

553
00:26:36,085 --> 00:26:37,685
I don't believe

554
00:26:37,685 --> 00:26:38,325
that we can't do it by ourselves!

555
00:26:59,805 --> 00:27:00,645
They are still not here.

556
00:27:09,165 --> 00:27:09,885
Miss.

557
00:27:10,885 --> 00:27:11,565
Miss.

558
00:27:11,645 --> 00:27:12,125
Nanny Bian.

559
00:27:13,005 --> 00:27:13,925
You've worked hard, Nanny Bian.

560
00:27:15,525 --> 00:27:17,005
How come you don't bring any luggage?

561
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:18,965
We've long wanted to

562
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:19,965
leave that tiger's lair.

563
00:27:20,165 --> 00:27:21,165
When we heard that we can go back,

564
00:27:21,445 --> 00:27:22,205
we didn't bother

565
00:27:22,245 --> 00:27:23,285
packing our things.

566
00:27:25,605 --> 00:27:27,365
But I've brought the items

567
00:27:27,365 --> 00:27:28,365
that Miss Ming asked for.

568
00:27:29,405 --> 00:27:29,845
Give me.

569
00:27:30,045 --> 00:27:30,925
Those are the deeds for the farmlands and shops

570
00:27:30,965 --> 00:27:32,645
that Eldest Miss brought with her as her dowry.

571
00:27:33,325 --> 00:27:34,605
I've kept those well-hidden,

572
00:27:34,645 --> 00:27:36,245
and didn't let that mother and son take them.

573
00:27:38,205 --> 00:27:38,885
This is great.

574
00:27:43,765 --> 00:27:45,405
Let's go and take back the shops.

575
00:27:45,605 --> 00:27:46,805
Take our own shops back!

576
00:27:48,445 --> 00:27:50,245
Eldest Young Master

577
00:27:51,325 --> 00:27:52,445
What does this mean?

578
00:27:52,445 --> 00:27:53,405
Are all the books there?

579
00:27:53,565 --> 00:27:54,205
They are all here.

580
00:27:55,045 --> 00:27:55,565
Don't.

581
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:56,925
Lock the doors well.

582
00:28:01,605 --> 00:28:02,325
Young Master.

583
00:28:07,525 --> 00:28:09,805
Those Sun family leeches,

584
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:13,965
they have sucked enough blood

585
00:28:14,005 --> 00:28:14,965
from my sister.

586
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,125
Fine

587
00:28:16,285 --> 00:28:17,445
Now that all the assets have been taken back,

588
00:28:17,605 --> 00:28:18,685
let's see what they will

589
00:28:18,725 --> 00:28:19,405
eat or drink from now on.

590
00:28:20,525 --> 00:28:21,845
This family is very shameless and dishonorable.

591
00:28:22,565 --> 00:28:24,125
I fear that it might not just end here.

592
00:28:26,005 --> 00:28:26,725
Let's just deal with

593
00:28:26,765 --> 00:28:27,685
whatever they throw at us.

594
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,285
That's right.

595
00:28:30,285 --> 00:28:31,165
We must rescue Sister Shulan

596
00:28:31,805 --> 00:28:33,285
from this family's fiery pit.

597
00:28:38,205 --> 00:28:38,765
Let's go.

598
00:28:39,485 --> 00:28:40,045
Go.

599
00:29:02,885 --> 00:29:05,365
That prostitute is so delicate!

600
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:07,285
Just because she's pregnant

601
00:29:07,325 --> 00:29:08,565
she treats herself as in some throne room,

602
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,725
and she has even started ordering me around!

603
00:29:13,805 --> 00:29:14,300
Son,

604
00:29:15,525 --> 00:29:16,125
since all those

605
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:17,285
maids of the Sheng Family left,

606
00:29:17,725 --> 00:29:18,885
I'm so exhausted.

607
00:29:19,845 --> 00:29:21,365
Now that our shops

608
00:29:21,365 --> 00:29:22,525
have been closed

609
00:29:23,925 --> 00:29:25,765
and the farm titles and money

610
00:29:25,885 --> 00:29:27,045
all got taken by that Sheng maid

611
00:29:27,045 --> 00:29:27,765
back to their house,

612
00:29:28,005 --> 00:29:29,845
we now don't have servants and money.

613
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:31,405
Right?

614
00:29:31,405 --> 00:29:32,605
And this pregnant woman inside

615
00:29:32,845 --> 00:29:35,005
wants to drink chicken soup

616
00:29:35,005 --> 00:29:36,525
or bird's nest every day.

617
00:29:36,845 --> 00:29:37,645
We don't have

618
00:29:37,645 --> 00:29:38,845
that much money left.

619
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,725
How about you go to the Sheng Manor

620
00:29:43,565 --> 00:29:45,205
and fetch Sheng Shulan back?

621
00:29:45,725 --> 00:29:48,325
That way

622
00:29:48,325 --> 00:29:49,525
we'll have money and servants.

623
00:29:49,725 --> 00:29:52,005
I'll also be more relaxed.

624
00:29:52,005 --> 00:29:53,005
Enough. Enough.

625
00:29:54,315 --> 00:29:56,325
If she wants to leave, just let her leave.

626
00:29:56,725 --> 00:29:57,405
Will that Sheng Family endure

627
00:29:57,405 --> 00:29:58,765
a reputation of an abandoned wife?

628
00:30:00,485 --> 00:30:02,245
In a few days, the Sheng Family will surely

629
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:03,405
send her back here

630
00:30:03,405 --> 00:30:04,245
with another two shops.

631
00:30:04,445 --> 00:30:05,245
Okay, I'm leaving.

632
00:30:05,365 --> 00:30:06,165
Son, son.

633
00:30:08,405 --> 00:30:10,765
We will soon run out of money.

634
00:30:12,365 --> 00:30:13,085
How about this?

635
00:30:13,365 --> 00:30:16,165
Today..don't treat those poet friends of yours

636
00:30:16,165 --> 00:30:17,805
to any more banquets.

637
00:30:18,005 --> 00:30:18,805
Let's try to spend less,

638
00:30:19,565 --> 00:30:20,645
so that

639
00:30:20,645 --> 00:30:22,125
we can make do until

640
00:30:22,645 --> 00:30:24,205
the Sheng Family returns your wife?

641
00:30:24,205 --> 00:30:25,565
You are totally absurd!

642
00:30:26,685 --> 00:30:28,205
Those people are all scholars.

643
00:30:28,205 --> 00:30:29,605
How can I break my promise?

644
00:30:33,645 --> 00:30:34,805
It will make me look uncultured.

645
00:30:34,805 --> 00:30:35,805
I'm going now.

646
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:39,805
Son

647
00:30:44,685 --> 00:30:45,565
How did you

648
00:30:45,605 --> 00:30:47,045
find the meal today?

649
00:30:47,285 --> 00:30:48,445
It was good!

650
00:30:48,445 --> 00:30:49,285
Definitely good!

651
00:30:49,405 --> 00:30:50,405
Thank you, Xiucai Sun,

652
00:30:50,485 --> 00:30:51,430
for that extravagant meal!

653
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:52,605
How about we change to another location

654
00:30:52,605 --> 00:30:54,005
and have some more drinks?

655
00:30:54,165 --> 00:30:55,365
Sure! As long as

656
00:30:55,365 --> 00:30:56,725
it's you who's paying, Great!

657
00:30:56,925 --> 00:30:57,965
we're fine with going anywhere!

658
00:30:58,485 --> 00:30:59,365
That bill put it on my credit.

659
00:30:59,845 --> 00:31:00,685
Xiucai Sun,

660
00:31:01,445 --> 00:31:02,485
actually you don't have

661
00:31:02,525 --> 00:31:03,285
a credit account in our shop.

662
00:31:03,525 --> 00:31:04,725
How about you

663
00:31:04,725 --> 00:31:05,805
paying for your bill today?

664
00:31:12,005 --> 00:31:13,125
What do you mean?

665
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:15,845
People from the Sheng Family came and said that

666
00:31:15,845 --> 00:31:17,165
your accounts will only be your accounts.

667
00:31:17,645 --> 00:31:18,965
The accounts of

668
00:31:18,965 --> 00:31:19,885
Eldest Miss Sheng is hers.

669
00:31:20,405 --> 00:31:21,485
Put it on my tab now!

670
00:31:25,605 --> 00:31:27,005
Once that bitch returns,

671
00:31:27,005 --> 00:31:28,165
I'll pay you!

672
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,365
Xiucai Sun, you see.

673
00:31:30,725 --> 00:31:31,845
When Official Zhao comes to eat,

674
00:31:31,845 --> 00:31:32,805
he pays.

675
00:31:32,965 --> 00:31:34,685
Isn't it unsuitable for you to not pay?

676
00:31:41,405 --> 00:31:42,325
How much?

677
00:31:42,325 --> 00:31:43,845
The total is two strings and four coins.

678
00:31:44,805 --> 00:31:45,445
Xiucai Sun,

679
00:31:45,845 --> 00:31:47,405
we won't dare come

680
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,445
at your invitation again!

681
00:31:48,605 --> 00:31:50,245
We're afraid that we won't be able to leave!

682
00:31:52,445 --> 00:31:53,845
Let's go. Let's go.

683
00:32:02,405 --> 00:32:03,285
Two strings and four coins, is that it?

684
00:32:06,365 --> 00:32:08,525
Is this item enough for you!

685
00:32:10,525 --> 00:32:11,725
Bitch.

686
00:32:12,605 --> 00:32:13,805
That bitch

687
00:32:14,605 --> 00:32:15,685
Bitch!

688
00:32:18,405 --> 00:32:19,125
Bitch!

689
00:32:21,245 --> 00:32:22,205
Bitch!

690
00:32:42,845 --> 00:32:43,587
What could be happening

691
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:44,565
in the front receiving hall now?

692
00:32:44,605 --> 00:32:46,245
Could they be bullying my sister?

693
00:32:47,405 --> 00:32:48,165
Don't be afraid.

694
00:32:48,605 --> 00:32:49,085
If there is any news,

695
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:51,005
Xiaotao will come inform us.

696
00:32:58,765 --> 00:32:59,845
Stop pacing.

697
00:33:00,205 --> 00:33:01,645
Even if you're not dizzy yet, I am!

698
00:33:03,485 --> 00:33:04,000
This

699
00:33:05,925 --> 00:33:07,325
The Sun Family refuses an amicable separation

700
00:33:07,325 --> 00:33:08,325
and insists on divorcing.

701
00:33:14,005 --> 00:33:15,165
As the old saying goes,

702
00:33:15,965 --> 00:33:17,284
if there are no descendants after seven years,

703
00:33:17,284 --> 00:33:17,925
that's a great mistake.

704
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:21,885
My daughter married into their family

705
00:33:22,165 --> 00:33:24,245
for less than three years,

706
00:33:24,765 --> 00:33:26,525
and already got him

707
00:33:26,565 --> 00:33:27,725
twelve or thirteen concubines.

708
00:33:29,165 --> 00:33:31,285
In the whole county, which family's main wife

709
00:33:31,725 --> 00:33:33,137
has willingly taken in that many

710
00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:34,405
concubines for her in-laws?

711
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,765
What nerve do you have to say

712
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:38,325
that she's shameless and unfilial?

713
00:33:38,485 --> 00:33:39,685
Even if it was twenty-two or twenty-three,

714
00:33:41,245 --> 00:33:42,405
weren't they all still unable

715
00:33:42,405 --> 00:33:43,285
to bear me any children?

716
00:33:47,245 --> 00:33:48,045
Clan Elders,

717
00:33:49,965 --> 00:33:51,845
now that my outside mistress is pregnant,

718
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,645
she should lower herself,

719
00:33:53,725 --> 00:33:54,965
welcome her into our family,

720
00:33:55,045 --> 00:33:56,165
and treat her well!

721
00:33:58,885 --> 00:34:00,085
But she?

722
00:34:00,085 --> 00:34:01,325
She instead left our house

723
00:34:01,765 --> 00:34:02,639
and stayed in her maiden house,

724
00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:03,205
refusing to return.

725
00:34:05,325 --> 00:34:06,525
What's the use

726
00:34:09,205 --> 00:34:10,405
of having a woman like that?

727
00:34:12,605 --> 00:34:13,205
Okay.

728
00:34:15,445 --> 00:34:16,685
Since that's the case,

729
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:20,405
then have the mother leave and let the child stay.

730
00:34:23,965 --> 00:34:24,965
Have the mother leave?

731
00:34:25,845 --> 00:34:27,005
Absolutely impossible!

732
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:29,205
Huaniang is already pregnant.

733
00:34:29,205 --> 00:34:30,045
She has toiled hard and contributed great merit!

734
00:34:32,845 --> 00:34:34,045
If your daughter refuses to

735
00:34:34,165 --> 00:34:34,845
welcome Huaniang into our house,

736
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,045
she only deserves a divorce paper from me

737
00:34:39,045 --> 00:34:40,125
and to become an abandoned wife.

738
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,285
Shut up!

739
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,605
Our Sheng family would never allow a prostitute

740
00:34:47,605 --> 00:34:48,645
to become a concubine!

741
00:34:51,565 --> 00:34:52,605
Just wait for

742
00:34:52,605 --> 00:34:53,485
my divorce letter then.

743
00:34:57,085 --> 00:34:58,045
Those atrocious scholars.

744
00:34:58,445 --> 00:34:58,885
Aren't they trying to

745
00:34:58,950 --> 00:34:59,965
destroy my sister's life?

746
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:02,285
Their family was

747
00:35:02,285 --> 00:35:03,165
initially very poor.

748
00:35:03,365 --> 00:35:04,445
Their house, shops, and servants

749
00:35:04,445 --> 00:35:05,645
were all from our family.

750
00:35:06,445 --> 00:35:07,485
So shameless.

751
00:35:07,925 --> 00:35:08,605
How could there be such a

752
00:35:08,645 --> 00:35:09,445
shameless person in this world?

753
00:35:09,805 --> 00:35:11,165
The servants were also from your family?

754
00:35:11,405 --> 00:35:12,125
Of course.

755
00:35:12,365 --> 00:35:13,125
What in their family

756
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:14,005
was not from my family?

757
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:16,325
Even his studies before

758
00:35:16,325 --> 00:35:17,605
were all funded by us.

759
00:35:19,925 --> 00:35:20,925
So shameless.

760
00:35:22,205 --> 00:35:23,925
Is Brother Changwu around?

761
00:35:24,725 --> 00:35:25,645
He's in the main hall.

762
00:35:26,525 --> 00:35:27,525
Main hall

763
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:31,285
Go and look for Young Master He.

764
00:35:31,285 --> 00:35:32,525
Tell him to wait for me at the western side door.

765
00:35:34,725 --> 00:35:35,885
Tell the stable to prepare the horses.

766
00:35:36,085 --> 00:35:37,005
I don't need a carriage,

767
00:35:37,205 --> 00:35:38,165
just three horses.

768
00:35:38,165 --> 00:35:38,885
Okay.

769
00:35:39,005 --> 00:35:39,645
Go quickly!

770
00:35:44,805 --> 00:35:46,205
Veiled hat.

771
00:35:46,325 --> 00:35:47,325
A long veiled hat. Two of them.

772
00:35:54,205 --> 00:35:55,325
Why do you need those?

773
00:35:55,645 --> 00:35:57,525
Maybe their Sun Family

774
00:35:57,525 --> 00:35:58,685
forgot some items.

775
00:36:00,045 --> 00:36:00,885
What items?

776
00:36:02,085 --> 00:36:02,965
A registration deed.

777
00:36:03,205 --> 00:36:06,085
A registration deed? What is that?

778
00:36:06,525 --> 00:36:09,085
Whether in buying slaves or taking in concubines

779
00:36:09,085 --> 00:36:10,405
there must be two copies of deeds.

780
00:36:10,965 --> 00:36:13,125
One is your census registration deed.

781
00:36:13,405 --> 00:36:15,445
The other is your sale contract.

782
00:36:15,725 --> 00:36:17,885
Didn't you say that the House of Sun

783
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:19,205
never had any servants?

784
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:21,085
I'm thinking that

785
00:36:21,085 --> 00:36:22,725
maybe they never knew this rule.

786
00:36:22,765 --> 00:36:24,165
They surely don't know.

787
00:36:24,165 --> 00:36:25,205
Even I don't know.

788
00:36:26,365 --> 00:36:28,325
I also just learned about it when I handled

789
00:36:28,325 --> 00:36:29,965
the documents as a house steward.

790
00:36:30,965 --> 00:36:31,885
They surely bought the sale contract

791
00:36:31,925 --> 00:36:33,085
from Qianjin Brothel.

792
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:37,005
But Huaniang is a prostitute.

793
00:36:37,205 --> 00:36:38,605
It's not enough

794
00:36:38,605 --> 00:36:39,925
that you obtain her sale contract.

795
00:36:41,565 --> 00:36:43,525
Let's go to Qianjin Brothel.

796
00:36:44,485 --> 00:36:46,285
Are you crazy? That's a brothel.

797
00:36:48,565 --> 00:36:49,485
Do you want an amicable separation or not?

798
00:36:51,405 --> 00:36:52,205
Let's go.

799
00:36:59,405 --> 00:37:01,085
Muddled. So muddled.

800
00:37:01,445 --> 00:37:03,005
Why must it reach the point

801
00:37:03,005 --> 00:37:04,365
of divorcing your wife?

802
00:37:05,445 --> 00:37:07,045
Just for a prostitute,

803
00:37:07,045 --> 00:37:09,725
you're saying conscienceless words.

804
00:37:09,885 --> 00:37:11,285
Although Huaniang is from a brothel,

805
00:37:11,365 --> 00:37:12,605
she's very clean!

806
00:37:12,765 --> 00:37:14,085
How could I abandon her?

807
00:37:17,565 --> 00:37:20,805
You all are just

808
00:37:20,845 --> 00:37:22,525
greedy of their wealth.

809
00:37:22,565 --> 00:37:23,725
Hence, you're distorting the truth here.

810
00:37:33,165 --> 00:37:34,045
Brother Hongwen,

811
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:36,245
go inside Qianjin Brothel

812
00:37:36,245 --> 00:37:38,085
and find the madam in charge.

813
00:37:38,325 --> 00:37:40,045
Tell her that

814
00:37:40,045 --> 00:37:41,202
if the registration deed of Huaniang

815
00:37:41,202 --> 00:37:41,805
is still with her,

816
00:37:42,405 --> 00:37:43,365
she must bring it to us

817
00:37:44,445 --> 00:37:45,325
and she'll be heavily-rewarded.

818
00:37:45,685 --> 00:37:46,805
We'll wait in the private room

819
00:37:46,805 --> 00:37:47,485
inside the restaurant.

820
00:37:48,365 --> 00:37:49,005
Okay.

821
00:37:49,525 --> 00:37:50,605
Hold this.

822
00:38:05,765 --> 00:38:07,245
Come and have fun.

823
00:38:07,245 --> 00:38:08,525
The girls here are all very good.

824
00:38:09,405 --> 00:38:09,925
Are there wines to drink?

825
00:38:10,045 --> 00:38:10,965
There are!

826
00:38:10,965 --> 00:38:11,885
Come inside and take a look.

827
00:38:12,005 --> 00:38:13,125
Let's go.

828
00:38:21,045 --> 00:38:22,085
Will this work?

829
00:38:26,525 --> 00:38:27,925
Don't even think of divorcing!

830
00:38:29,405 --> 00:38:30,405
We will only allow for an amicable separation.

831
00:38:30,605 --> 00:38:31,205
Amicable separation?

832
00:38:31,445 --> 00:38:32,528
Who wants to do that and pretentiously

833
00:38:32,528 --> 00:38:33,285
preserve your reputation?

834
00:38:33,285 --> 00:38:34,365
I will only write a divorce letter.

835
00:38:36,005 --> 00:38:37,805
Even if you want a divorce letter,

836
00:38:38,645 --> 00:38:40,965
you still have to return the shops,

837
00:38:41,245 --> 00:38:44,085
money, and servants to us

838
00:38:44,965 --> 00:38:46,125
before my son write it.

839
00:38:47,805 --> 00:38:49,565
Those are the dowry items from our Sheng family.

840
00:38:50,005 --> 00:38:51,685
Since she has married into our Sun family,

841
00:38:51,885 --> 00:38:52,965
she will then have to live and die

842
00:38:52,965 --> 00:38:53,800
as a member of the Sun family.

843
00:38:53,925 --> 00:38:55,165
All these things now belong to the Sun family!

844
00:38:56,245 --> 00:38:57,485
What do you mean saying its yours?

845
00:38:58,245 --> 00:38:59,165
It all now belongs to the Sun family!

846
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,245
Not to mention a main wife,

847
00:39:04,845 --> 00:39:06,885
but even

848
00:39:06,885 --> 00:39:08,205
the dowry of concubines

849
00:39:09,165 --> 00:39:10,845
are their own possessions.

850
00:39:11,725 --> 00:39:13,925
Even if they are divorced or they die,

851
00:39:14,205 --> 00:39:15,525
the maiden family

852
00:39:15,525 --> 00:39:17,205
has the right to take them back!

853
00:39:18,165 --> 00:39:19,805
If you want money,

854
00:39:20,645 --> 00:39:23,485
go the capital

855
00:39:23,485 --> 00:39:24,600
and and file a complaint!

856
00:39:24,805 --> 00:39:25,445
Mother.

857
00:39:27,645 --> 00:39:28,605
You don't want to return the shops

858
00:39:28,605 --> 00:39:30,205
and farms of our family?

859
00:39:34,165 --> 00:39:34,765
Okay.

860
00:39:36,565 --> 00:39:37,165
Okay.

861
00:39:38,285 --> 00:39:39,300
Then just wait for us

862
00:39:40,085 --> 00:39:41,045
take in that Huaniang in as concubine

863
00:39:41,405 --> 00:39:43,005
when we go back to our house today.

864
00:39:44,605 --> 00:39:45,765
If your Eldest Miss

865
00:39:47,045 --> 00:39:49,005
wants to continue being the main wife

866
00:39:51,605 --> 00:39:53,445
just let her live like a widow then!

867
00:40:04,525 --> 00:40:05,525
What's your name, Madam?

868
00:40:06,805 --> 00:40:08,245
It's been such a long time

869
00:40:08,245 --> 00:40:10,125
since anyone asked my name.

870
00:40:10,565 --> 00:40:13,885
My surname is Fei.

871
00:40:14,285 --> 00:40:15,445
Please sit down.

872
00:40:24,885 --> 00:40:26,165
We asked you to come here today

873
00:40:26,645 --> 00:40:27,245
to buy the

874
00:40:27,245 --> 00:40:28,645
registration deed of Huaniang.

875
00:40:29,645 --> 00:40:31,645
Since you're treating me this respectfully

876
00:40:31,645 --> 00:40:33,605
I dare not deceive you.

877
00:40:34,045 --> 00:40:36,005
It's just that Huaniang

878
00:40:36,005 --> 00:40:37,245
has been bought by someone else.

879
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:39,494
They said that she's going to be

880
00:40:39,494 --> 00:40:40,485
taken in as a concubine.

881
00:40:41,845 --> 00:40:43,685
That deed you're asking about

882
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:46,325
then becomes useless.

883
00:40:47,805 --> 00:40:50,445
Madam Fei, I'll pay you twice their price.

884
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:52,645
Miss,

885
00:40:52,645 --> 00:40:54,365
what are you planning to do?

886
00:40:54,725 --> 00:40:56,525
You had better clarify it first.

887
00:40:58,365 --> 00:40:59,165
Three times their offer.

888
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:04,005
This is not a matter of money.

889
00:41:08,285 --> 00:41:09,685
Never thought Madam Fei is this stubborn.

890
00:41:10,805 --> 00:41:12,337
Don't know if this Qianjin Brothel,

891
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:13,205
being named qianjin

892
00:41:14,045 --> 00:41:15,725
can really afford to lose so much money?

893
00:41:17,125 --> 00:41:18,325
What do you mean?

894
00:41:19,925 --> 00:41:20,605
There are bandits

895
00:41:20,605 --> 00:41:22,085
roaming around the Youyang territory lately.

896
00:41:23,765 --> 00:41:25,045
I fear that your Qianjin Brothel might have

897
00:41:25,085 --> 00:41:26,685
some bandits already mixed in.

898
00:41:27,245 --> 00:41:29,445
The government lately is worried

899
00:41:29,485 --> 00:41:30,725
and has vowed to investigate it.

900
00:41:32,245 --> 00:41:33,325
Don't know for how long your Qianjin Brothel

901
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,965
might still be open?

902
00:41:35,525 --> 00:41:36,765
How much money will you be losing,

903
00:41:36,765 --> 00:41:37,765
Madam Fei?

904
00:41:39,525 --> 00:41:40,525
Who really are you?

905
00:41:41,445 --> 00:41:43,325
That woman has already been sold.

906
00:41:43,325 --> 00:41:45,005
This registration deed has no use for you now.

907
00:41:45,245 --> 00:41:46,565
Wouldn't it be more appropriate

908
00:41:46,565 --> 00:41:47,765
to sell it to us at a high price?

909
00:41:51,005 --> 00:41:53,085
Madam Fei, do you have a chronic headache illness?

910
00:41:54,045 --> 00:41:54,805
When it attacks,

911
00:41:54,965 --> 00:41:56,285
not only is it unbearable

912
00:41:56,285 --> 00:41:57,685
you even still hear ringing in your ears?

913
00:42:03,125 --> 00:42:04,245
How did you know?

914
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,045
I can't cure your headache,

915
00:42:09,285 --> 00:42:10,685
but I can do acupuncture

916
00:42:10,685 --> 00:42:11,565
and prescribe you with medication.

917
00:42:11,885 --> 00:42:14,165
At the very least, you can have a peaceful sleep

918
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:15,525
every spring and autumn night.
