00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,037 --> 00:01:02,890
Episode 28

3
00:01:03,471 --> 00:01:04,311
Duke Qi of the State was only

4
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:05,751
passing by Prince Yong's manor,

5
00:01:05,831 --> 00:01:07,191
when the door gate suddenly opened

6
00:01:07,431 --> 00:01:09,111
and Prince Yong came out to welcome him.

7
00:01:09,511 --> 00:01:10,656
He insisted on pulling him inside

8
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,871
for wine and catching up.

9
00:01:12,191 --> 00:01:13,308
The street was crowded with people

10
00:01:13,308 --> 00:01:14,111
from the Prince's manor.

11
00:01:14,391 --> 00:01:14,796
We really couldn't leave,

12
00:01:14,796 --> 00:01:15,271
so without any better options,

13
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:17,071
we had to brace ourselves to go in.

14
00:01:17,111 --> 00:01:17,991
And then?

15
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:18,831
I was only waiting by the gate.

16
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:20,071
I was only waiting by the gate.

17
00:01:20,471 --> 00:01:21,471
Once it got dark,

18
00:01:21,711 --> 00:01:23,471
someone came to tell me to return to send word

19
00:01:23,591 --> 00:01:24,511
that the Duke was a guest

20
00:01:24,911 --> 00:01:25,911
at the Prince Yong Manor's feast,

21
00:01:26,151 --> 00:01:26,441
he drank too much

22
00:01:26,441 --> 00:01:27,071
and had difficulty to move,

23
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:28,031
so he wouldn't come back.

24
00:01:28,151 --> 00:01:28,951
May Princess and Young Lord

25
00:01:29,111 --> 00:01:29,791
take care of themselves.

26
00:01:31,111 --> 00:01:32,151
Inside the Imperial fortress,

27
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:33,951
being close to the Emperor,

28
00:01:35,071 --> 00:01:36,431
a noble Prince

29
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:39,071
committed an act of kidnapping?

30
00:01:39,431 --> 00:01:41,551
They are too menacing.

31
00:01:41,991 --> 00:01:43,791
Even the Emperor,

32
00:01:44,591 --> 00:01:45,648
doesn't dare to

33
00:01:45,648 --> 00:01:46,631
menace his subjects like this.

34
00:01:47,831 --> 00:01:48,831
Get my carriage.

35
00:01:48,951 --> 00:01:49,751
OK

36
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:50,631
Mother,

37
00:01:50,751 --> 00:01:51,631
what do you intend to do?

38
00:01:52,631 --> 00:01:55,031
I will go to the palace to meet His Majesty.

39
00:01:55,391 --> 00:01:56,791
Mother, didn't you say the Emperor is gravely ill

40
00:01:57,031 --> 00:01:57,951
and unable to hold audience?

41
00:01:58,151 --> 00:01:58,871
Even if I can't see him,

42
00:02:00,551 --> 00:02:01,591
I will still find a way to see him.

43
00:02:01,911 --> 00:02:03,031
If it really doesn't work,

44
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:04,111
I will just break in.

45
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:05,151
If blame is to be cast,

46
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:06,551
I will shoulder it all myself.

47
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,391
I will come with you.

48
00:02:10,391 --> 00:02:11,391
It's cold out,

49
00:02:11,711 --> 00:02:12,551
and you're still sick.

50
00:02:13,071 --> 00:02:14,191
Just wait for my return.

51
00:02:15,191 --> 00:02:16,271
How can I allow you to go alone

52
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:18,431
to rescue my father?

53
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:20,111
If I cannot get into the palace,

54
00:02:20,951 --> 00:02:22,449
I will wait for you

55
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:23,951
outside the palace.

56
00:02:36,551 --> 00:02:37,831
I have already sent someone

57
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:39,311
to inquire at Prince Yong's.

58
00:02:40,431 --> 00:02:41,591
That Princess Consort Yong,

59
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,911
she is a bit domineering usually.

60
00:02:44,351 --> 00:02:45,662
But to kidnap a merit noble

61
00:02:45,662 --> 00:02:47,071
of the royal court in public

62
00:02:47,951 --> 00:02:49,711
That's indeed too...

63
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:50,471
Your highness

64
00:02:52,351 --> 00:02:53,311
How is it?

65
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,431
I already sent someone.

66
00:02:55,591 --> 00:02:56,431
Who did you send?

67
00:02:56,991 --> 00:02:58,425
My foster son.

68
00:02:59,071 --> 00:03:00,551
My most trusted aide.

69
00:03:00,831 --> 00:03:03,151
He's usually called by the name of "Xiaosi".

70
00:03:04,471 --> 00:03:05,372
He arrived at the Prince Yong's

71
00:03:05,372 --> 00:03:05,911
manor and inquired,

72
00:03:06,631 --> 00:03:07,831
and the Princess Consort Yong said

73
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:09,791
Duke Qi did indeed came by.

74
00:03:10,111 --> 00:03:12,071
But before it gets dark,

75
00:03:12,351 --> 00:03:13,580
he had already left and wasn't there now.

76
00:03:13,671 --> 00:03:14,511
She's lying!

77
00:03:15,511 --> 00:03:16,711
How can he not be at the manor?

78
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:18,071
My servant

79
00:03:18,471 --> 00:03:19,751
isn't blind or dumb.

80
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:21,351
He can figure out

81
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:22,351
whose manor the Duke of the State went into?

82
00:03:22,551 --> 00:03:23,951
Princess Consort of Yong must be lying.

83
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:26,551
You didn't have him go in and look around?

84
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:28,991
Xiaosi didn't obey the Princess Consort,

85
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:31,471
looked around in detail in the manor,

86
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,871
and Duke Qi was indeed not in the manor.

87
00:03:36,871 --> 00:03:37,631
They must have

88
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:38,551
hidden him.

89
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:39,711
In such a grand Prince's manor,

90
00:03:40,111 --> 00:03:40,951
there must be a secret chamber

91
00:03:41,071 --> 00:03:42,271
or an underground cellar.

92
00:03:47,391 --> 00:03:48,351
Your Highness!

93
00:03:48,711 --> 00:03:49,831
I swear to Heaven,

94
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:51,742
Duke Qi of the State is indeed

95
00:03:51,742 --> 00:03:53,231
being held hostage by Prince Yong

96
00:03:53,271 --> 00:03:54,351
and remains not yet returned home!

97
00:03:54,591 --> 00:03:56,751
Or else, may Your Highness find Prince Yong

98
00:03:56,871 --> 00:03:58,431
and speak face-to-face with my servant.

99
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:00,311
If I am speaking a little falsehood,

100
00:04:00,591 --> 00:04:01,511
Qi House

101
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:03,591
will surely be confiscated and exterminated!

102
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:04,951
Stand up, my child.

103
00:04:05,271 --> 00:04:07,471
I saw you growing up by my side.

104
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:09,431
Why do you curse yourself like this?

105
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,551
You are anxious and I understand.

106
00:04:11,911 --> 00:04:13,711
But we're amid an auspicious time right now.

107
00:04:14,071 --> 00:04:14,972
Prince Yong is offering sacrifices to the gods

108
00:04:14,972 --> 00:04:16,071
and ancestors on behalf of His Majesty,

109
00:04:16,191 --> 00:04:17,351
and the gate is sealed.

110
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,471
No one can see him.

111
00:04:20,991 --> 00:04:22,671
He schemed this in advance!

112
00:04:26,191 --> 00:04:27,231
How about this then?

113
00:04:28,391 --> 00:04:29,231
I will have Eunuch Zhu

114
00:04:29,351 --> 00:04:30,231
take my imperial decree

115
00:04:30,511 --> 00:04:32,351
and search his manor personally.

116
00:04:33,271 --> 00:04:34,551
He's my trusted subordinate

117
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:37,351
and the Princess Consort will not slight him.

118
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:39,511
You go have a rest at the guest room,

119
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:40,551
and await for news.

120
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:41,471
Hurry and go now.

121
00:04:43,111 --> 00:04:43,951
Queen Mother.

122
00:04:44,391 --> 00:04:45,511
Queen Mother.

123
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,671
I can only depend on you.

124
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:49,471
Go now.

125
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:33,951
Nonsense.

126
00:05:35,311 --> 00:05:35,991
I don't believe it!

127
00:05:36,351 --> 00:05:37,111
I don't believe it!

128
00:05:38,911 --> 00:05:40,111
I will go see Her Highness.

129
00:05:40,911 --> 00:05:42,071
I will go see Her Highness!

130
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:44,660
Her Highness has not sent an order

131
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,551
to summon you, Princess.

132
00:05:45,751 --> 00:05:46,991
You cannot barge in, Princess.

133
00:05:48,031 --> 00:05:49,351
Duke Qi of the State is in danger.

134
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:50,951
I will see Her Highness!

135
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,991
Princess.

136
00:06:18,151 --> 00:06:18,911
Mother.

137
00:06:21,511 --> 00:06:22,791
It didn't work, right?

138
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:31,751
What?

139
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:32,791
His Majesty doesn't care

140
00:06:32,911 --> 00:06:33,711
if we live or die too?

141
00:06:42,871 --> 00:06:44,831
His Majesty is gravely ill

142
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,311
and I couldn't see him.

143
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,671
Her Highness is so busy too.

144
00:06:55,111 --> 00:06:58,231
She doesn't have the time to worry about us.

145
00:06:59,111 --> 00:07:00,311
Alright. Come.

146
00:07:01,271 --> 00:07:01,751
Let's go.

147
00:07:01,871 --> 00:07:04,831
Prince Yong calculated the timing perfectly.

148
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:07,126
He is said to be offering to the gods

149
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:08,648
and ancestors on His Majesty's behalf

150
00:07:08,648 --> 00:07:09,511
to beg for blessing.

151
00:07:10,391 --> 00:07:12,499
Princess Consort Yong will not admit it

152
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:13,471
no matter what.

153
00:07:16,351 --> 00:07:18,191
No matter what I say,

154
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:21,711
I can't convince Her Highness.

155
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:22,911
Be careful.

156
00:07:30,311 --> 00:07:31,431
Here.

157
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,631
You're still ill.

158
00:07:40,311 --> 00:07:41,711
Hurry and rest up.

159
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:46,431
Tomorrow I will wait in the palace again,

160
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:47,471
and beg Her Highness.

161
00:07:48,031 --> 00:07:48,511
That Prince Yong,

162
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:50,511
he has kidnapped your father though,

163
00:07:50,911 --> 00:07:53,831
I guess he doesn't dare to harm him.

164
00:07:54,911 --> 00:07:55,871
So you be assured too.

165
00:07:56,551 --> 00:07:57,551
Mother.

166
00:07:58,391 --> 00:07:59,511
You've drunk the sedative tonic,

167
00:08:00,191 --> 00:08:01,391
and rest first.

168
00:08:01,631 --> 00:08:02,625
Conserce strength and store up energy.

169
00:08:03,591 --> 00:08:04,911
After you are refreshed,

170
00:08:05,191 --> 00:08:06,671
we can go find Father.

171
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,391
Alright. Alright.

172
00:08:10,111 --> 00:08:10,911
Good child.

173
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:12,271
Go.

174
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:41,391
Young Lord, please rest.

175
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:47,311
I don't know if Buwei

176
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,551
drank the Mengpo Soup

177
00:08:51,951 --> 00:08:53,471
on the Bridge of Vanity.

178
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,500
(In China's tales, it's said people after death will forget all the joys and sorrows in life after drinking the Mengpo Soup.)

179
00:08:55,231 --> 00:08:56,511
Buwei was most loyal

180
00:08:56,551 --> 00:08:57,631
and devoted to you.

181
00:09:00,111 --> 00:09:01,231
I guess the heaven will pity him

182
00:09:02,431 --> 00:09:03,271
and in his next life,

183
00:09:04,271 --> 00:09:05,791
he will be born into a good family.

184
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,031
I wish Buwei's next life,

185
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:31,831
could have a lifetime of happiness

186
00:09:31,831 --> 00:09:32,751
and bliss.

187
00:09:37,671 --> 00:09:38,631
Let him not met a house

188
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:41,751
like ours again.

189
00:09:43,991 --> 00:09:44,391
Young Lord,

190
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:45,831
do you consider the ducal manor not good?

191
00:09:54,471 --> 00:09:55,671
People outside look at us.

192
00:09:58,471 --> 00:10:00,471
They think we can get everything,

193
00:10:01,471 --> 00:10:02,871
as long as we want.

194
00:10:07,711 --> 00:10:09,111
We look up to the palace,

195
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:16,071
and we also think Emperor is

196
00:10:17,151 --> 00:10:18,751
majestic and powerful.

197
00:10:23,591 --> 00:10:25,671
But we are all just human.

198
00:10:27,151 --> 00:10:28,751
We are not saints.

199
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:33,511
The Emperor has pain in his heart.

200
00:10:35,711 --> 00:10:37,111
People like us

201
00:10:40,271 --> 00:10:41,951
have pain in our hearts too.

202
00:10:55,151 --> 00:10:57,990
This pain

203
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,911
that cannot be mentioned.

204
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,423
This hurt

205
00:11:07,423 --> 00:11:10,311
that cannot stopped.

206
00:11:13,271 --> 00:11:18,631
Though three thousand stars fall into the river

207
00:11:20,671 --> 00:11:26,831
they are still not as bright as the moon.

208
00:11:47,631 --> 00:11:48,471
Ridiculous.

209
00:11:51,031 --> 00:11:52,791
It's too ridiculous.

210
00:12:06,431 --> 00:12:08,231
For hundred of years,

211
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,311
people needed only to do good deeds.

212
00:12:13,311 --> 00:12:14,351
Do good deeds.

213
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:18,271
Young Lord,

214
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:19,671
what's so urgent

215
00:12:19,711 --> 00:12:20,183
that you have to come here

216
00:12:20,183 --> 00:12:20,751
this late at night?

217
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:22,071
Here

218
00:12:28,431 --> 00:12:30,111
May Prince Yong do a good deed

219
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,311
and allow me to see him.

220
00:12:34,271 --> 00:12:35,231
His Majesty is sick,

221
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:36,831
so my husband

222
00:12:36,831 --> 00:12:38,151
went to offer sacrifices for him.

223
00:12:38,551 --> 00:12:39,311
He's not inside the manor.

224
00:12:41,311 --> 00:12:42,791
Then may Princess Consort Yong do a good deed

225
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:47,031
and let my father go.

226
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:50,951
Young Lord,

227
00:12:51,231 --> 00:12:52,791
what are you talking about?

228
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,511
How come I can't understand?

229
00:13:03,071 --> 00:13:04,631
I can then only leave my corpse behind

230
00:13:06,751 --> 00:13:07,831
to marry the Princess.

231
00:13:15,831 --> 00:13:17,031
People all say that

232
00:13:17,431 --> 00:13:18,671
the Young Lord of Qi House

233
00:13:18,951 --> 00:13:20,191
has a temperament similar to his father.

234
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:21,742
Gentle and amicable.

235
00:13:21,742 --> 00:13:23,031
Easy to manipulate.

236
00:13:24,151 --> 00:13:26,311
Never thought that the people got it wrong.

237
00:13:27,471 --> 00:13:29,431
I think that you are born with

238
00:13:29,631 --> 00:13:31,311
a sense of arrogance.

239
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:33,831
You indeed are the son of Princess Pingning.

240
00:13:35,391 --> 00:13:36,911
Although my Qi Family only

241
00:13:36,911 --> 00:13:38,431
has me as their descendant

242
00:13:39,951 --> 00:13:41,391
and is not as prestigious as it was before,

243
00:13:42,871 --> 00:13:45,631
we still can't just do nothing

244
00:13:46,311 --> 00:13:47,591
and let others kill us.

245
00:13:50,431 --> 00:13:52,031
Although I don't have any merit or noble title,

246
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,751
I'm well-known

247
00:13:54,831 --> 00:13:55,711
in front of the Emperor.

248
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:59,577
Even if the Royal House of Yong has power

249
00:13:59,577 --> 00:14:01,391
that can cover the sky,

250
00:14:02,871 --> 00:14:04,391
it still can't cover up such a huge case.

251
00:14:08,231 --> 00:14:10,831
Young Lord, you're still too young.

252
00:14:12,831 --> 00:14:13,951
Our inviting Duke Qi of the State

253
00:14:13,991 --> 00:14:15,151
to be a guest in our house

254
00:14:15,431 --> 00:14:16,951
isn't a threat.

255
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:19,031
It's just that there are things

256
00:14:19,231 --> 00:14:20,951
that we clearly must discuss the pros

257
00:14:21,191 --> 00:14:22,151
and cons of with him.

258
00:14:23,991 --> 00:14:26,791
We both are royal relatives.

259
00:14:28,511 --> 00:14:30,151
As the saying goes,

260
00:14:30,471 --> 00:14:32,151
we will see each other regularly as such.

261
00:14:32,551 --> 00:14:34,071
Why must we use violence,

262
00:14:34,311 --> 00:14:35,511
and destroy our harmonious relationship?

263
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,123
You people abducted my father

264
00:14:40,123 --> 00:14:41,551
and kept him in your manor.

265
00:14:41,951 --> 00:14:43,099
You still think that our harmonious relationship

266
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:43,591
won't get affected!

267
00:14:44,591 --> 00:14:45,231
If we hadn't

268
00:14:45,231 --> 00:14:46,471
invited him over,

269
00:14:46,671 --> 00:14:47,231
how...

270
00:14:47,391 --> 00:14:49,351
how could you visit our house?

271
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,399
There are some words that must be

272
00:14:53,831 --> 00:14:55,460
said in front of you.

273
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,031
Young Lord.

274
00:14:58,591 --> 00:14:59,471
I know that

275
00:14:59,991 --> 00:15:01,075
you persist on refusing to

276
00:15:01,075 --> 00:15:02,311
be married with my daughter,

277
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:04,671
because you love that

278
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,511
concubine's daughter of the Sheng family.

279
00:15:10,391 --> 00:15:11,151
What...

280
00:15:12,031 --> 00:15:13,031
what are you going to do?

281
00:15:16,511 --> 00:15:17,231
Indeed.

282
00:15:18,031 --> 00:15:18,871
Just as you've said.

283
00:15:19,471 --> 00:15:20,551
If you insist on not obeying,

284
00:15:21,431 --> 00:15:22,831
I can't really kill you

285
00:15:23,071 --> 00:15:24,191
and your father.

286
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:26,911
But the House of Sheng is different.

287
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:29,416
With Prince's status and since it's still not known

288
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:30,471
who the throne will belong to,

289
00:15:31,271 --> 00:15:33,311
to have a fifth-rank official

290
00:15:33,471 --> 00:15:34,911
and his entire family eliminated

291
00:15:35,951 --> 00:15:37,631
won't be that hard for us.

292
00:15:39,951 --> 00:15:40,951
You really think that

293
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,311
this empire

294
00:15:43,431 --> 00:15:44,591
is already yours?

295
00:15:45,031 --> 00:15:46,631
Even if it's not ours,

296
00:15:46,871 --> 00:15:48,121
the House of Sheng is still just that

297
00:15:48,121 --> 00:15:49,071
of a fifth-rank official.

298
00:15:51,031 --> 00:15:52,311
Young Lord,

299
00:15:52,671 --> 00:15:53,871
if you die,

300
00:15:54,231 --> 00:15:56,831
that girl of the Sheng family must die with you.

301
00:15:57,031 --> 00:15:59,511
The House of Qi having no descendant,

302
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:01,911
Princess Pingning and Duke Qi of the State

303
00:16:02,751 --> 00:16:04,271
will be living with an empty house

304
00:16:04,591 --> 00:16:06,151
for the rest of their lives.

305
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,071
In this vast world,

306
00:16:38,671 --> 00:16:40,111
there are hundreds of talented men.

307
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:43,711
Why must you insist on

308
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,191
choosing to kill our family?

309
00:16:49,271 --> 00:16:49,991
If a family like yours

310
00:16:50,151 --> 00:16:51,631
who only has a useless title

311
00:16:52,751 --> 00:16:54,191
can laugh at us openly,

312
00:16:54,511 --> 00:16:55,511
but curse us behind our backs,

313
00:16:56,991 --> 00:16:59,551
what will the empire be in the future?

314
00:17:00,991 --> 00:17:02,431
If my daughter couldn't get

315
00:17:02,831 --> 00:17:04,311
the things that she wanted in the past,

316
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,911
and still can't make it now,

317
00:17:09,871 --> 00:17:11,551
I will have been a useless mother.

318
00:17:38,311 --> 00:17:39,271
What a good

319
00:17:41,271 --> 00:17:43,191
and deep motherly affection.

320
00:17:46,551 --> 00:17:47,728
Such a good display of a benevolent mother

321
00:17:47,728 --> 00:17:48,191
and a filial child.

322
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:52,591
Princess Consort,

323
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:57,911
if parents love their children,

324
00:17:59,271 --> 00:18:02,191
they should plan ahead.

325
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,031
You really think

326
00:18:07,831 --> 00:18:09,231
that this is planning ahead?

327
00:18:15,551 --> 00:18:16,511
How stupid you are!

328
00:18:17,271 --> 00:18:18,151
How stupid you are!

329
00:18:27,751 --> 00:18:29,671
The heavens wants to harm His Majesty.

330
00:18:33,591 --> 00:18:34,871
My dynasty's empire

331
00:18:36,476 --> 00:18:37,351
will actually

332
00:18:40,151 --> 00:18:40,884
end up

333
00:18:40,884 --> 00:18:42,111
in the hands of people like this.

334
00:19:05,231 --> 00:19:06,271
Qi Yuanruo,

335
00:19:08,591 --> 00:19:10,151
you have no other choice.

336
00:19:27,951 --> 00:19:29,271
If you sign this marriage contract,

337
00:19:30,991 --> 00:19:32,831
your father can go home immediately.

338
00:19:34,351 --> 00:19:36,313
The House of Sheng will also

339
00:19:36,313 --> 00:19:37,911
be at peace from now on.

340
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:45,343
No matter it's a state princess

341
00:19:45,343 --> 00:19:46,671
or a city princess,

342
00:19:49,391 --> 00:19:50,711
I will never take her in as my wife.

343
00:19:53,031 --> 00:19:54,231
The main wife that I will marry

344
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,031
can only be you, Sheng Minglan.

345
00:21:20,511 --> 00:21:21,351
Sign it.

346
00:21:24,591 --> 00:21:25,831
You have no other choice.

347
00:21:50,471 --> 00:21:52,591
Big Madam, you look so delightful.

348
00:21:52,631 --> 00:21:54,151
Is there some joyous news at home?

349
00:21:55,791 --> 00:21:57,311
You can say so.

350
00:21:57,671 --> 00:21:58,631
I'm inviting you

351
00:21:59,071 --> 00:21:59,951
and these three ladies

352
00:22:00,351 --> 00:22:02,191
to be guests in my house.

353
00:22:04,911 --> 00:22:06,351
These three daughters of mine

354
00:22:06,831 --> 00:22:08,711
are crude and lacking in proper etiquette.

355
00:22:09,311 --> 00:22:10,605
They might embarrass themselves once

356
00:22:10,605 --> 00:22:12,471
they reach your Count Manor.

357
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:15,071
You're being too humble.

358
00:22:15,591 --> 00:22:17,231
Your three ladies even went to

359
00:22:17,471 --> 00:22:18,751
the Marquis Gu Manor already.

360
00:22:18,951 --> 00:22:19,511
No to mention

361
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,111
a measly Count Manor like mine!

362
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:23,791
Moreover, if you come this time,

363
00:22:24,151 --> 00:22:25,631
you don't need to fear bumping into that

364
00:22:25,871 --> 00:22:28,071
tigress Princess Pingning.

365
00:22:28,351 --> 00:22:29,231
Why?

366
00:22:30,271 --> 00:22:31,551
Her only son Qi Heng

367
00:22:31,831 --> 00:22:34,151
will be marrying Princess Jiacheng soon.

368
00:22:34,431 --> 00:22:35,751
Since she's busy preparing for the wedding,

369
00:22:35,991 --> 00:22:37,271
she won't have time to come out

370
00:22:37,471 --> 00:22:38,471
for social gatherings

371
00:22:38,751 --> 00:22:39,831
to find his son a wife anymore.

372
00:22:41,511 --> 00:22:42,751
Are you talking about the daughter of Prince Yong?

373
00:22:42,951 --> 00:22:43,831
Of course.

374
00:22:44,351 --> 00:22:45,471
She can be considered

375
00:22:46,391 --> 00:22:48,391
as one of the most noble ladies

376
00:22:48,591 --> 00:22:49,871
here in the capital.

377
00:22:50,111 --> 00:22:51,111
There's no doubt that

378
00:22:51,351 --> 00:22:53,911
her future is very promising.

379
00:22:54,951 --> 00:22:57,431
After picking here and there,

380
00:22:57,671 --> 00:22:59,311
Princess Pingning finally got the top one.

381
00:23:02,311 --> 00:23:04,911
But this matter mustn't be publicized too much.

382
00:23:05,271 --> 00:23:06,631
His Majesty is severely ill.

383
00:23:06,871 --> 00:23:08,197
It isn't convenient for the Prince Yong Manor

384
00:23:08,197 --> 00:23:09,711
and Duke Qi House to organize a grand celebration.

385
00:23:09,751 --> 00:23:11,791
Hence, they only quietly

386
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:12,831
invited some old friends.

387
00:23:13,511 --> 00:23:15,351
Lot of families in Bianjing

388
00:23:15,551 --> 00:23:16,831
still don't know about it.

389
00:23:17,831 --> 00:23:20,071
A marriage

390
00:23:20,071 --> 00:23:21,151
between royal families

391
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,711
is actually being done in such stealthy manner.

392
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:25,591
Don't you find that ridiculous?

393
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,271
Yes, it is.

394
00:23:28,671 --> 00:23:30,151
It is indeed ridiculous.

395
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:32,031
It follows that

396
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:35,471
Prince Yong will most likely get the position.

397
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,848
Princess Pingning is well acquainted with

398
00:23:37,848 --> 00:23:39,151
the people in the palace.

399
00:23:39,471 --> 00:23:41,671
Maybe she received some news

400
00:23:41,911 --> 00:23:43,151
from the Emperor.

401
00:23:43,951 --> 00:23:45,911
This is why he is suddenly

402
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:48,471
engaged with the daughter of Prince Yong.

403
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:54,151
That Big Madam Wu

404
00:23:54,191 --> 00:23:55,751
is clearly being happy at the disaster of others.

405
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,751
She was still laughing like that.

406
00:23:57,031 --> 00:23:57,991
Who does she think is stupid

407
00:23:58,031 --> 00:23:58,951
and cannot get her meaning?

408
00:24:00,911 --> 00:24:02,351
Just the Duke Qi of the Ducal House.

409
00:24:02,671 --> 00:24:03,421
There are so many noble

410
00:24:03,421 --> 00:24:04,831
and highly-ranked families in the capital.

411
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,151
There are ducal, count,

412
00:24:07,311 --> 00:24:07,991
and marquis houses everywhere.

413
00:24:08,551 --> 00:24:09,271
I won't miss the whole forest

414
00:24:09,391 --> 00:24:10,351
because of a tree.

415
00:24:11,231 --> 00:24:12,150
Once I get splendidly married-off

416
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:12,911
to a higher-ranking family,

417
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:15,271
I'll eventually come back to mock her.

418
00:24:18,711 --> 00:24:19,391
Miss,

419
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:21,591
are you alright?

420
00:24:21,911 --> 00:24:23,151
What's wrong? Are you alright?

421
00:24:25,391 --> 00:24:27,071
I'm fine. I-I'm fine.

422
00:24:44,111 --> 00:24:45,311
Grandmother, why did you come?

423
00:24:54,071 --> 00:24:54,988
"The Wu and Kuaiji Commanderies

424
00:24:54,988 --> 00:24:55,591
are not my hometown.

425
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:58,391
How can I stay here for long?"

426
00:25:00,551 --> 00:25:01,671
Minglan,

427
00:25:02,911 --> 00:25:04,271
where do you want to stay?

428
00:25:08,031 --> 00:25:08,831
You all step down.

429
00:25:21,551 --> 00:25:23,031
You are not young,

430
00:25:23,431 --> 00:25:25,151
to trip on level ground.

431
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,511
Come here, let me see it.

432
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,511
I'm fine, Grandmother.

433
00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:33,631
It's not painful anymore.

434
00:25:35,311 --> 00:25:37,631
I've heard about what happened in the House of Qi.

435
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:42,391
He was quite a good child,

436
00:25:43,071 --> 00:25:45,191
just isn't fated to be with our family.

437
00:25:47,871 --> 00:25:49,111
A person

438
00:25:49,711 --> 00:25:52,111
can't have everything go his way.

439
00:25:54,071 --> 00:25:56,031
Just treat it as encountering a setback.

440
00:25:58,111 --> 00:25:59,431
You tripped and got hurt, so just cry it out.

441
00:26:00,231 --> 00:26:01,431
After crying, climb up again.

442
00:26:01,751 --> 00:26:02,711
You still have to live your days.

443
00:26:13,151 --> 00:26:14,751
Don't be too stubborn.

444
00:26:17,871 --> 00:26:18,791
Don't be sad.

445
00:26:20,551 --> 00:26:22,671
The marriage of children of aristocratic families

446
00:26:23,151 --> 00:26:24,511
are not for them to decide in the first place.

447
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:27,951
You've fought for yourself

448
00:26:28,111 --> 00:26:28,871
already.

449
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,551
There shouldn't be any regrets.

450
00:26:37,391 --> 00:26:38,991
If you have hurt your knees because of tripping,

451
00:26:39,351 --> 00:26:40,791
I can blow on it for you.

452
00:26:43,071 --> 00:26:44,031
If it hurts your heart,

453
00:26:45,151 --> 00:26:47,711
I will find you a better man

454
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:48,831
in the future.

455
00:26:56,951 --> 00:26:57,711
Inviting me?

456
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:00,671
Apparently

457
00:27:01,151 --> 00:27:01,857
General Xie wants me

458
00:27:01,857 --> 00:27:03,311
to show respects on his behalf.

459
00:27:04,031 --> 00:27:04,892
But in fact, he wants me

460
00:27:04,892 --> 00:27:06,071
to shut myself up and ponder my mistakes.

461
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:09,271
I don't think I'm worthy of the word "invite".

462
00:27:09,391 --> 00:27:10,071
No.

463
00:27:10,951 --> 00:27:11,482
The General

464
00:27:11,482 --> 00:27:12,240
sent us to wait on you

465
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,551
regarding you as a true talent.

466
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,405
You are able to defeat hundreds just by yourself,

467
00:27:14,405 --> 00:27:15,031
and are always victorious in your battles.

468
00:27:15,591 --> 00:27:16,591
Without you,

469
00:27:16,831 --> 00:27:17,511
we'll be dead

470
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,711
without any doubt.

471
00:27:21,991 --> 00:27:22,711
You mean

472
00:27:23,031 --> 00:27:24,991
you people want me to become your stepping-stone.

473
00:27:25,231 --> 00:27:27,151
I've said the wrong words.

474
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:28,791
The General has great wisdom and discernment.

475
00:27:29,391 --> 00:27:30,615
To say that I'm superior to him

476
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:31,391
at fighting battles,

477
00:27:32,191 --> 00:27:33,711
I'm not worthy.

478
00:27:36,431 --> 00:27:37,298
Rong'er,

479
00:27:37,831 --> 00:27:38,551
Come here.

480
00:27:39,271 --> 00:27:40,951
Your father has important matters to discuss.

481
00:27:41,191 --> 00:27:42,151
Don't disturb him.

482
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,711
Nanny,

483
00:27:44,431 --> 00:27:45,991
I'm going to the front line soon.

484
00:27:46,391 --> 00:27:47,591
While I still have time,

485
00:27:47,991 --> 00:27:49,271
let me teach Rong to write some more words.

486
00:27:51,151 --> 00:27:52,351
So you just

487
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:53,431
bantered with us.

488
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,311
We'll set out tomorrow.

489
00:28:10,671 --> 00:28:12,191
Since you've decided to go back,

490
00:28:13,151 --> 00:28:15,111
why did you make things difficult for those two?

491
00:28:17,591 --> 00:28:18,551
In the past,

492
00:28:18,791 --> 00:28:20,791
I would fight against everything,

493
00:28:21,071 --> 00:28:22,631
causing myself to be badly hurt.

494
00:28:23,311 --> 00:28:25,591
Now, I've learned to be smarter

495
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:27,031
because of my Eldest Brother and Big Madam.

496
00:28:27,431 --> 00:28:28,871
Once they face problems in battle,

497
00:28:29,111 --> 00:28:30,151
they would naturally come to beg me to help.

498
00:28:30,991 --> 00:28:31,831
If I acts to ignore them,

499
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:33,191
they would then not dare belittle me

500
00:28:33,471 --> 00:28:35,071
when I go back.

501
00:28:36,871 --> 00:28:38,311
What has the world come to?

502
00:28:39,231 --> 00:28:41,151
The pure, loyal, and upright people are forced

503
00:28:41,831 --> 00:28:43,871
to continuously scheme just to get by.

504
00:28:45,831 --> 00:28:47,591
Nanny is just biased toward me.

505
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:48,951
I'm not a pure,

506
00:28:48,951 --> 00:28:50,111
loyal and upright man.

507
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,591
That would be best to describe Yuanruo.

508
00:28:53,151 --> 00:28:54,040
Talking about the Young Lord

509
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:54,831
of the ducal House of Qi,

510
00:28:55,791 --> 00:28:56,911
I heard that

511
00:28:57,151 --> 00:28:59,591
he's about to marry the daughter of Prince Yong.

512
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:00,911
Young Master,

513
00:29:01,751 --> 00:29:03,591
when will you get married?

514
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,071
Nanny, did you hear it wrong?

515
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,975
The House of Qi is really

516
00:29:08,975 --> 00:29:10,471
making a marriage alliance with Prince Yong?

517
00:29:10,831 --> 00:29:11,951
How can it be wrong?

518
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,631
I heard it from idle servants of the Marquis House

519
00:29:14,031 --> 00:29:15,951
gossiping in the market yesterday.

520
00:29:16,111 --> 00:29:16,863
I heard that

521
00:29:17,351 --> 00:29:17,844
the House of Qi

522
00:29:17,844 --> 00:29:18,431
has taken into consideration that

523
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:19,431
the Emperor is sick,

524
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:21,071
so they didn't publicize it too much.

525
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,943
They only invited close relatives

526
00:29:22,943 --> 00:29:24,511
and old friends to attend the wedding.

527
00:29:27,991 --> 00:29:29,151
I'll go get Yuanruo.

528
00:29:34,671 --> 00:29:36,351
I heard that Prince Yong has prayed to

529
00:29:36,551 --> 00:29:37,551
the heavens on behalf of His Majesty.

530
00:29:39,431 --> 00:29:40,311
Yes.

531
00:29:42,511 --> 00:29:45,511
Then does your mother

532
00:29:45,511 --> 00:29:46,351
find this wedding

533
00:29:47,711 --> 00:29:49,231
very satisfying?

534
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:52,511
Uncle,

535
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:54,751
if I don't agree,

536
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:56,831
even the House of Sheng will face a disaster.

537
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,191
If you were I,

538
00:29:59,471 --> 00:30:00,311
what would you do?

539
00:30:02,151 --> 00:30:03,231
If I were you,

540
00:30:05,431 --> 00:30:06,511
I'd enter the palace

541
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:07,951
and see the Emperor.

542
00:30:08,471 --> 00:30:09,351
Sue the whole family

543
00:30:09,351 --> 00:30:10,551
of Prince Yong in Wende Hall!

544
00:30:11,391 --> 00:30:12,071
If that doesn't work,

545
00:30:12,431 --> 00:30:13,711
I'll learn the method of Prince Yong.

546
00:30:14,871 --> 00:30:16,671
If he kidnap the daughter of someone,

547
00:30:16,751 --> 00:30:17,871
I will also kidnap his daughter!

548
00:30:19,991 --> 00:30:20,911
Without the princess,

549
00:30:21,031 --> 00:30:22,271
who will he marry off to you?

550
00:30:23,951 --> 00:30:25,471
By then, because of the delays,

551
00:30:26,151 --> 00:30:27,031
this matter will eventually

552
00:30:27,191 --> 00:30:27,991
get failed.

553
00:30:30,391 --> 00:30:31,431
Taking a step back.

554
00:30:32,471 --> 00:30:33,147
No matter how unbridled

555
00:30:33,147 --> 00:30:34,111
and arrogant that Princess is,

556
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:36,591
she wouldn't dare marry a husband

557
00:30:36,711 --> 00:30:38,111
as harsh and unreasonable as you, right?

558
00:30:41,591 --> 00:30:42,871
This method harms others

559
00:30:43,871 --> 00:30:45,111
without benefiting myself.

560
00:30:46,151 --> 00:30:48,951
Prince Yong will soon be named the Crown Prince.

561
00:30:51,671 --> 00:30:52,391
Such an act might

562
00:30:52,391 --> 00:30:53,471
lead to clan annihilation.

563
00:30:57,751 --> 00:30:58,963
Place him on a field of death

564
00:30:58,963 --> 00:31:00,111
and he will fight to live.

565
00:31:01,991 --> 00:31:02,838
Since you want to live

566
00:31:02,838 --> 00:31:03,911
according to what you desire,

567
00:31:04,391 --> 00:31:06,151
you then must take risks.

568
00:31:07,791 --> 00:31:09,111
In your growing up,

569
00:31:09,711 --> 00:31:11,311
you were able to get whatever you wanted.

570
00:31:11,751 --> 00:31:12,871
You never knew how to

571
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:13,791
compete or struggle for something.

572
00:31:13,791 --> 00:31:14,446
Of course, you also wouldn't know that

573
00:31:14,446 --> 00:31:15,231
in competing or fighting for something,

574
00:31:15,991 --> 00:31:17,551
you need methods.

575
00:31:21,271 --> 00:31:22,111
Uncle, you mean

576
00:31:24,271 --> 00:31:25,471
it was my mistake?

577
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,151
Of course it was!

578
00:31:29,031 --> 00:31:30,791
From the start, you should

579
00:31:30,831 --> 00:31:31,711
have expressed your stand to your parents.

580
00:31:32,711 --> 00:31:33,770
No matter how much your mother

581
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:34,471
tried to hinder you,

582
00:31:35,231 --> 00:31:35,781
you should have been

583
00:31:35,781 --> 00:31:36,551
willing to die than to submit!

584
00:31:36,911 --> 00:31:37,551
And you must have

585
00:31:37,551 --> 00:31:38,751
got married now.

586
00:31:38,911 --> 00:31:40,751
But you kept pondering about it

587
00:31:40,991 --> 00:31:42,991
and kept feeling that it wasn't the right time.

588
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:53,151
I feel sorry for Minglan.

589
00:31:54,831 --> 00:31:56,031
I now don't have the nerve

590
00:31:58,191 --> 00:31:59,351
to enter the Sheng Manor anymore.

591
00:32:00,071 --> 00:32:01,071
Uncle.

592
00:32:02,111 --> 00:32:02,911
Uncle.

593
00:32:05,951 --> 00:32:07,111
This one.

594
00:32:09,591 --> 00:32:10,831
Please give it to her for me.

595
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:14,191
Let's talk about it later.

596
00:32:14,671 --> 00:32:15,351
Yuanruo,

597
00:32:16,071 --> 00:32:17,391
the House of Sheng doesn't have a very high rank.

598
00:32:17,991 --> 00:32:19,042
You have a crush on their daughter,

599
00:32:19,042 --> 00:32:19,831
it is beyond their reach.

600
00:32:20,511 --> 00:32:21,951
This matter has spread all over the capital

601
00:32:22,071 --> 00:32:23,351
such that everyone now knows about it.

602
00:32:23,751 --> 00:32:24,551
If you're going to

603
00:32:24,831 --> 00:32:25,951
marry the Princess now,

604
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:26,991
Minglan will be laughed at

605
00:32:27,831 --> 00:32:29,111
by other people.

606
00:32:29,871 --> 00:32:31,551
How can she still seek marriage in the future?

607
00:32:31,751 --> 00:32:33,311
Who will still give her any respect?

608
00:32:33,431 --> 00:32:35,031
Have you thought about it for her sake?

609
00:32:40,031 --> 00:32:41,191
I know that,

610
00:32:41,951 --> 00:32:43,111
but what can I do?

611
00:32:44,271 --> 00:32:45,103
You are now living on your own.

612
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:46,191
You can do

613
00:32:46,191 --> 00:32:47,231
whatever you want.

614
00:32:47,471 --> 00:32:48,471
But I'm not you.

615
00:32:48,671 --> 00:32:49,311
I...

616
00:32:50,351 --> 00:32:50,711
I

617
00:32:51,151 --> 00:32:52,511
I can't put the whole Qi Clan in danger

618
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:56,271
just for my own happiness.

619
00:32:58,991 --> 00:32:59,831
Yuanruo,

620
00:33:01,511 --> 00:33:02,711
if you dare

621
00:33:02,711 --> 00:33:03,671
fight for this lady,

622
00:33:05,111 --> 00:33:06,111
there's no need for your House of Qi to act.

623
00:33:07,591 --> 00:33:08,871
I'll go to the Prince Yong Manor

624
00:33:08,871 --> 00:33:10,151
and abduct that lady for you.

625
00:33:11,431 --> 00:33:12,991
We're now in the troubled times,

626
00:33:13,871 --> 00:33:15,511
and Prince Yong wouldn't dare publicize it.

627
00:33:16,311 --> 00:33:18,071
This is your last chance.

628
00:33:18,911 --> 00:33:19,831
Think about it well.

629
00:33:27,191 --> 00:33:29,831
Come on, Yuanruo.

630
00:33:31,151 --> 00:33:32,311
As long as you give the permission,

631
00:33:33,191 --> 00:33:34,911
I'll go through any kind of danger for you.

632
00:33:35,711 --> 00:33:36,431
I don't think that

633
00:33:36,551 --> 00:33:38,511
Sheng lady deserves to suffer like this.

634
00:33:39,871 --> 00:33:40,871
The rest of her life

635
00:33:41,031 --> 00:33:42,351
all depends on your in this moment!

636
00:33:54,871 --> 00:33:55,671
Yuanruo.

637
00:33:57,911 --> 00:33:58,751
Say something!

638
00:34:11,231 --> 00:34:12,991
Destiny plays jokes on people?

639
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,911
While walking in this world,

640
00:34:16,351 --> 00:34:17,791
if you are afraid to take steps forward,

641
00:34:18,111 --> 00:34:19,471
and afraid to take steps backward,

642
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:22,111
you won't make anything happen.

643
00:34:52,191 --> 00:34:52,911
Sister Yanghao.

644
00:34:53,511 --> 00:34:54,191
What does Second Brother

645
00:34:54,191 --> 00:34:55,231
actually want to gift me

646
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:56,511
that he's gone through

647
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,431
this trouble of hiding it?

648
00:34:57,751 --> 00:34:58,791
I don't really know either.

649
00:34:59,031 --> 00:34:59,871
Second Young Master said

650
00:34:59,911 --> 00:35:00,791
he didn't want it to be known,

651
00:35:01,271 --> 00:35:02,751
and if Fourth and Fifth Miss find out,

652
00:35:02,911 --> 00:35:03,791
they will snatch it from you.

653
00:35:09,431 --> 00:35:10,471
Second Uncle Gu?

654
00:35:11,031 --> 00:35:12,111
Where's my Second Brother?

655
00:35:14,071 --> 00:35:15,591
I wanted to borrow the border boundary map to see.

656
00:35:16,231 --> 00:35:17,871
He went to get it from Uncle Sheng

657
00:35:18,031 --> 00:35:19,071
and asked me to wait.

658
00:35:20,391 --> 00:35:21,471
Then please wait, Second Uncle.

659
00:35:22,511 --> 00:35:23,111
I will come

660
00:35:23,111 --> 00:35:24,111
talk to my brother later.

661
00:35:26,431 --> 00:35:27,231
Sixth Miss.

662
00:35:36,521 --> 00:35:37,551
I wonder if you

663
00:35:38,271 --> 00:35:39,071
have received

664
00:35:39,231 --> 00:35:40,271
any new calligraphy books lately?

665
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,151
Your Second Brother heard

666
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,671
that a great calligrapher

667
00:35:48,671 --> 00:35:49,791
has appeared from Liaodong.

668
00:35:50,871 --> 00:35:52,271
So he sought a sample from him,

669
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,551
and had me bring it to you.

670
00:35:59,831 --> 00:36:01,151
Liaodong is a remote area.

671
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:02,671
What great calligraphy can arise?

672
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:08,151
Since your brother

673
00:36:08,671 --> 00:36:10,391
isn't here

674
00:36:11,071 --> 00:36:12,111
now,

675
00:36:14,871 --> 00:36:15,871
you'd like to take a look first?

676
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,711
Danju and I

677
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:21,151
will prepare a bowl of great tea for you.

678
00:36:40,151 --> 00:36:41,271
I told your Second Brother

679
00:36:43,031 --> 00:36:44,311
that if you don't want to see it,

680
00:36:45,151 --> 00:36:46,151
you don't have to.

681
00:36:47,351 --> 00:36:48,911
I can just send it back to Liaodong.

682
00:37:07,831 --> 00:37:09,271
Are there any messages from Liaodong?

683
00:37:11,351 --> 00:37:14,951
He said it is a great calligraphy book,

684
00:37:16,071 --> 00:37:16,991
but he wrote it badly.

685
00:37:18,991 --> 00:37:20,351
He owes you greatly.

686
00:37:26,111 --> 00:37:27,111
What else did he say?

687
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:31,711
Not much.

688
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,791
He only feels

689
00:37:36,551 --> 00:37:37,871
it was a great calligraphy book

690
00:37:37,911 --> 00:37:39,071
and he's written it into this state.

691
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:41,351
He is ashamed to face you,

692
00:37:43,551 --> 00:37:44,791
and he doesn't want to give any excuse.

693
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:47,591
He just asked me

694
00:37:47,751 --> 00:37:48,471
to bring the book to you.

695
00:37:52,191 --> 00:37:53,391
Please wait, Second Uncle.

696
00:38:18,231 --> 00:38:18,991
Xiaotao!

697
00:38:19,711 --> 00:38:20,831
Bring me my clay doll

698
00:38:20,843 --> 00:38:22,111
and have it wrapped nicely.

699
00:38:52,391 --> 00:38:53,791
This clay doll.

700
00:38:55,991 --> 00:38:57,351
You said it looks like me smiling.

701
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:01,791
But looking similar

702
00:39:03,391 --> 00:39:04,511
is useless.

703
00:39:06,951 --> 00:39:08,751
Young Lord broke

704
00:39:08,751 --> 00:39:09,751
his promise to you.

705
00:39:10,951 --> 00:39:11,671
Miss,

706
00:39:12,031 --> 00:39:13,111
I'll go shatter this clay doll

707
00:39:13,231 --> 00:39:13,831
to pieces now.

708
00:39:15,751 --> 00:39:16,511
Xiaotao,

709
00:39:17,071 --> 00:39:17,831
I won't blame him.

710
00:39:20,071 --> 00:39:20,951
Though he doesn't say it,

711
00:39:22,391 --> 00:39:23,751
I know he has his a painful reason.

712
00:39:27,271 --> 00:39:29,711
What he hopes to achieve just can't be achieved.

713
00:39:31,311 --> 00:39:32,071
It's not him to blame.

714
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:36,847
Let's go now

715
00:39:36,847 --> 00:39:37,711
to return this to him,

716
00:39:38,431 --> 00:39:39,471
to finish this.

717
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:46,751
Let's go.

718
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,631
Won't you keep it as a memento?

719
00:40:30,631 --> 00:40:31,551
No need.

720
00:40:37,191 --> 00:40:38,431
What's so funny?

721
00:40:39,831 --> 00:40:40,711
Back then,

722
00:40:40,991 --> 00:40:42,671
I told you Manniang wasn't a good person.

723
00:40:43,631 --> 00:40:44,431
You wouldn't believe me

724
00:40:45,631 --> 00:40:46,511
and I blamed that you were a fool.

725
00:40:47,991 --> 00:40:49,151
That day at the Marquis Manor,

726
00:40:50,231 --> 00:40:51,351
you compared Qi Heng and I to

727
00:40:51,671 --> 00:40:52,711
Emperor Ming and Consort Yang,

728
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,231
and I also didn't believe you.

729
00:40:57,351 --> 00:40:58,471
It seems now

730
00:41:00,271 --> 00:41:02,471
we are just too dumb and too foolish.

731
00:41:03,791 --> 00:41:05,471
We just wouldn't listen.

732
00:41:08,151 --> 00:41:11,031
This world has always been full of

733
00:41:11,151 --> 00:41:12,071
mishaps and bad timings.

734
00:41:12,791 --> 00:41:13,576
You...

735
00:41:13,591 --> 00:41:14,831
I understand

736
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:18,071
Alright.

737
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,431
Alright.

738
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:26,991
The war on the southern frontier is intense.

739
00:41:28,031 --> 00:41:29,631
After I return the book,

740
00:41:29,991 --> 00:41:31,031
I will leave.

741
00:41:33,191 --> 00:41:34,551
The world is chaotic

742
00:41:34,911 --> 00:41:35,671
and tumultuous now.

743
00:41:36,631 --> 00:41:37,955
Swords and spears on the battlefield have no eyes.

744
00:41:39,071 --> 00:41:40,031
Young Master, may you take care of yourself.

745
00:41:49,631 --> 00:41:50,431
Thank you.

746
00:41:58,631 --> 00:42:00,551
If there are too many idle rumors later on,

747
00:42:00,991 --> 00:42:02,111
or your marital talks don't fare smoothly,

748
00:42:02,831 --> 00:42:04,111
you must not let them bother you.

749
00:42:05,431 --> 00:42:06,431
Wait for me to return

750
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:08,671
and I will teach those garrulous people a lesson!

751
00:42:10,831 --> 00:42:11,563
We don't need to

752
00:42:11,563 --> 00:42:13,111
mention about marital talks again.

753
00:42:14,871 --> 00:42:15,671
Why not?

754
00:42:17,151 --> 00:42:18,151
The future

755
00:42:18,431 --> 00:42:19,711
is never predictable.

756
00:42:21,151 --> 00:42:22,431
If it hadn't been for your persuasion,

757
00:42:23,031 --> 00:42:23,791
I would still be with the Canal Gang,

758
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,071
surviving in the world.

759
00:42:25,871 --> 00:42:27,151
Look at me now, not long after that,

760
00:42:27,671 --> 00:42:28,871
I am already an important member of the army,

761
00:42:30,031 --> 00:42:30,831
heavily entrusted.

762
00:42:31,631 --> 00:42:32,191
But now,

763
00:42:32,231 --> 00:42:33,271
you're acting foolish!

764
00:42:36,951 --> 00:42:37,831
In all matters, look ahead.

765
00:42:39,071 --> 00:42:40,751
Live your good life.

766
00:42:55,111 --> 00:42:55,951
It's true.

767
00:42:56,911 --> 00:42:58,351
Our eyes are grown on the front side,

768
00:42:59,031 --> 00:43:00,591
so we should look forward.

769
00:43:04,111 --> 00:43:05,151
We come to the world only once,

770
00:43:06,271 --> 00:43:07,951
and should try to live well.
