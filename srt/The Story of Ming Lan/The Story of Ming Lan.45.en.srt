00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Ming Lan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,580
Episode 45

3
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,800
Big Madam, please enjoy it.

4
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,000
Didn't expect there would be such an expert.

5
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,680
Her skill in brewing tea

6
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,120
is even better than mine.

7
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,960
The foam of the tea is white like snow.

8
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,800
It doesn't break up after quite a while.

9
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,880
That's great.

10
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,240
She's my unmarried older daughter.

11
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,960
She used to

12
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,960
serve nobles in a duke's manor.

13
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,000
She has picked up

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,200
some foolish skills.

15
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,080
Big Madam, please don't laugh.

16
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,720
How old is she?

17
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,120
Is she engaged to anyone?

18
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,680
Not yet.

19
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,360
She's still young

20
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,840
and need to wait for a while.

21
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,440
Your daughter is bright, clever,

22
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,640
delicate and pretty.

23
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,680
The rest of them

24
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,800
are probably good as well.

25
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,575
Why don't you call them out

26
00:02:16,575 --> 00:02:17,480
and let me take a look?

27
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,280
I only have two daughters.

28
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,400
The younger one is eight years old.

29
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,040
She's very naughty.

30
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,160
She's like a mud skipper every day,

31
00:02:27,201 --> 00:02:28,760
running all over the hill.

32
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,320
She's not worthy to be seen by noble people.

33
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,840
Big Madam, everything has been completed.

34
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,720
Let's start.

35
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,960
Cuiwei,

36
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,160
according to the names in the register,

37
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,920
distribute each of them one thousand copper coins.

38
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,920
Those families with elders

39
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,280
that are more than 60 years old,

40
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,960
Distribute three hundred more to each

41
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,520
Yes.

42
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,560
Big Madam, what are you doing?

43
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,800
Everyone has worked hard.

44
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,360
This farmstead is now taken on the name of Gu.

45
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,560
This is my first time here.

46
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,880
I'm rewarding everyone with some money

47
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,080
to make everyone happy.

48
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,000
What is your name?

49
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,440
Wang Sheng.

50
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,800
Three thousand copper coins.

51
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,520
Here, this is for you.

52
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,504
Is this really for me?

53
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,600
Yes.

54
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,080
Take it.

55
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,400
Thank you.

56
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,640
Thank you.

57
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,880
How many people are there in your family?

58
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,480
Next one.

59
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,120
Thank you.

60
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,520
One people each time.

61
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,480
Thank you.

62
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,880
Thank you.

63
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,160
There are 62 qing of farmlands here

64
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,400
in Heishan Farmstead,

65
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,960
and 33 registered.

66
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,880
agricultural families here.

67
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,160
When Older Brother Tu brought people

68
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,160
to check the article,

69
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,280
he discovered that

70
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,280
there are 960 mu of extra farmlands

71
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,575
and the number of farming household

72
00:04:22,575 --> 00:04:23,120
is not consistent with the register too.

73
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,720
There must be more again.

74
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,640
Big Madam, you are right.

75
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,600
When we distributed the money,

76
00:04:29,618 --> 00:04:30,840
there were around 4 or 5 people that want the money,

77
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,040
but their names

78
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,040
were not in the registry.

79
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,320
They said that

80
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,360
they indeed worked in Heishan Farm.

81
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,800
I did the task according to your instructions

82
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,200
and didn't give them trouble.

83
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,000
They left after taking the money.

84
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,280
When you were in the field,

85
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,320
did anyone

86
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,320
talk to you privately?

87
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,640
Yes.

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,680
Someone came to report to Older Brother Tu,

89
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,263
saying that Manager Ba

90
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,400
and the other managers

91
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,200
had set up their private fields outside

92
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,640
and registered them under their relatives' name.

93
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,520
Those additional

94
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,400
land and tenants

95
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,840
were probably hidden and not reported.

96
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,800
The annual revenue went

97
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,840
into their own pockets too.

98
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,550
If we didn't prepare

99
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,750
the money in advance,

100
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,280
we wouldn't have been able to

101
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,720
catch that many big rats.

102
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,560
Big Madam,

103
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,880
Old Ba Fu brought some other managers here

104
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,960
to see you.

105
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,080
They said that they were here to seek punishment.

106
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,000
Tell them to come in.

107
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,120
Please enter.

108
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,640
I admit my mistake.

109
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,120
Big Madam, please show mercy.

110
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,600
You were slaves from a punished official.

111
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,360
When the Duke of State's Manor was confiscated,

112
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,920
You should

113
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,080
have already been sold off.

114
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,680
You all were granted

115
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,040
to us alongside the farmstead.

116
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,120
Now that the duke's manor

117
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,120
has been confiscated,

118
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,025
you people instead are hiding

119
00:06:24,025 --> 00:06:24,960
a lot of private wealth.

120
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,680
You even tried to gang up to trick me.

121
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,760
You are indeed a talented slave.

122
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,700
We were

123
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,220
momentarily blinded.

124
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,400
I know that I'm wrong now.

125
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,240
Big Madam, please show mercy.

126
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,040
I'll immediately tell them

127
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,720
to sell off their private farms.

128
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,740
Tomorrow, I will publicly allow

129
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,710
Shut up.

130
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,760
Is Big Madam

131
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,000
greedy over your money?

132
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,480
It's fine.

133
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,160
You people have worked hard

134
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,350
for so many years in watching

135
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,240
over the farmlands of this farmstead.

136
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,080
It's really nothing

137
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,040
to have a bit of savings.

138
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,400
But not reporting the number of farmlands

139
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,000
here in the farmstead

140
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,320
and privately hiring farming families

141
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,960
is against the family rules.

142
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,440
If I just let it go,

143
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,000
then if other people will imitate,

144
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,800
won't our family be a mess?

145
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,520
You can leave now.

146
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,080
Once I inspects Guyan Farmstead,

147
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,280
I'll discuss this with the General

148
00:07:21,287 --> 00:07:22,520
before giving out the punishment.

149
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,360
Before I came,

150
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,880
I have already checked everything.

151
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,560
Guyan Farmstead is different

152
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,280
from Heishan Farmstead.

153
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,040
Guyan Farmstead was the confiscated family asset

154
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,920
several years ago.

155
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,280
It's under royal rule for more than a decade.

156
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,080
This asset

157
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,675
has been managed

158
00:07:52,675 --> 00:07:54,040
by an imperially designated eunuch.

159
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,440
With the imperial family being in-charge,

160
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,000
even if things do happen here,

161
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,520
very few people will intervene.

162
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,000
The water there in Guyan Farmstead

163
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,440
is even deeper.

164
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,760
Big Madam, I fear

165
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,400
we won't be able to use the same trick

166
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,640
as Heishan Farm

167
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,760
We've been in Heishan Farmstead for several days.

168
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,960
I'm sure that the news of what we've done

169
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,040
there has already leaked.

170
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,600
This method will not work anymore.

171
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,280
We need to change to another way.

172
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,600
It seems that some

173
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,800
people are missing within us.

174
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,080
Did they lose their way?

175
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,200
It's not even a wild and mountainous area.

176
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,400
How could they have gotten lost?

177
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,840
I told several smart staff

178
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,960
to dress up as traders

179
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,040
to obtain information

180
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,160
from the farmers.

181
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,880
We are

182
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,400
too eye-catching.

183
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,800
They surely will guard against us very tightly.

184
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,760
Why not

185
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,840
just put up a pole there?

186
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,080
Let those farmstead managers

187
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,960
get tangled up with it.

188
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,480
But in reality,

189
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,075
we've already sent people

190
00:08:49,075 --> 00:08:50,280
to secretly investigate the situation beforehand.

191
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,480
At the very least,

192
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,760
we surely will get something.

193
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,040
Who are you?

194
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,760
Big Madam, greetings!

195
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,480
I don't dare accept such bows. Please get up.

196
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,680
I heard that Manager Wu

197
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,880
is a relative of a palace eunuch.

198
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,240
My apologies for being disrespectful.

199
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,960
I dare not accept such respect.

200
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,960
I'm just

201
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,680
a very far relative.

202
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,880
Relying on that,

203
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,120
I'm just trying to earn something for living.

204
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,480
Then let's

205
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,825
complete the checking

206
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:53,880
of the accounts for the land,

207
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,160
before we have our usual chats.

208
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,200
These people are managing the fields,

209
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,800
orchards, mountain forest,

210
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,440
and the farming households.

211
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,840
Big Madam, you can ask them

212
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,960
if you have any questions

213
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,880
As long as it's about the farmstead,

214
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,560
they know

215
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,960
everything.

216
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,375
The fish scale records,

217
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,120
the accounting books, and contracts

218
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,520
have all been prepared.

219
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,120
You can review them anytime.

220
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,400
If there are any lapses,

221
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,080
you can immediately ask people to edit them.

222
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,440
Seems like he has already prepared

223
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,960
the fake account and not afraid to be checked.

224
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,775
When you are the one in-charge

225
00:10:25,775 --> 00:10:26,360
of the books in the future,

226
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,760
you must guard against that.

227
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,520
No need to hurry.

228
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,920
I have checked the accounts for several days.

229
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,240
My eyes and back hurt.

230
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,480
The scenery is nice here.

231
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,320
Why don't we take a stroll and relax?

232
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,360
Let's just talk while walking.

233
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,400
It's fine too.

234
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,640
It's such a big land, mountain and forest.

235
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,280
As a manager throughout the whole year,

236
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,160
it must be very tough.

237
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,040
I dare not say that it is hard,

238
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,768
but I did placed half-life worth of blood

239
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:25,400
and sweat into this farmstead.

240
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,050
His Majesty then rewarded

241
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,200
this farmstead to your family.

242
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,040
My uncle initially wanted to

243
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,320
find me another job.

244
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,120
But I've been here for so many years,

245
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,960
I have some affection towards it.

246
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,320
I only want to stay and serve here.

247
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm afraid that

248
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,040
it might ruin your future

249
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,200
and people might laugh.

250
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,840
That old uncle of mine

251
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,640
has very good relationship

252
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,880
with the other high ranking eunuch of the palace.

253
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,720
They all say that General Gu

254
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,880
has always been open-minded and generous.

255
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,200
Everyone loves to make friend with him.

256
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,640
And General Gu is

257
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,800
currently favored by His Majesty.

258
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,840
I think

259
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,000
no one dares to say anything.

260
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,680
Who would dare to order

261
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,200
around the manager

262
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,120
of a previous imperial farmstead?

263
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,280
If I make you stay,

264
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,200
I don't know

265
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,200
how outsiders will laugh at

266
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,040
our Gu Family for being unruly.

267
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,360
Even the elders of our family

268
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,520
might be coming to scold us now.

269
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,640
You also can't be sold

270
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,160
as a servant to enter our house.

271
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,360
It's still improper and unreasonable.

272
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,975
Wouldn't it become a laughing matter

273
00:12:25,975 --> 00:12:26,480
in the kingdom?

274
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,480
Who are you?

275
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,440
What are you doing here?

276
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,520
Tell me now.

277
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,400
You're not gonna talk without some pain?

278
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,720
Speak now!

279
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,760
Speak!

280
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,440
Big Madam.

281
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,120
Are you going to talk or not?

282
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,720
Go back.

283
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,520
Okay.

284
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,720
The farmers said that

285
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,760
there were people asking about the fields,

286
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,280
mountain forest, and the populace here.

287
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,920
They thought they were bandits

288
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,160
and were captured.

289
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,880
It was a misunderstanding.

290
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,200
Blame me for this.

291
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,280
Before I came,

292
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,960
I made a bet with the General.

293
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,440
We bet on how many trees there are

294
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,040
in the mountain forest.

295
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,720
That's why I sent two accountants

296
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,760
to get dressed

297
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,400
to secretly check.

298
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,560
The General has such a humor.

299
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Those who are aware,

300
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,320
know that Big Madam is joking.

301
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,480
Those who don't,

302
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,560
would think that

303
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,040
we are secretly being investigated.

304
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,400
Manager Wu, what are you saying?

305
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,120
You have been in this village for many years

306
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,200
and are experienced in your work.

307
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,520
Everything must have been done methodically.

308
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,200
Is there a need to be secretly investigated?

309
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,360
Your words is making me feel embarrassed.

310
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,625
There are 50 to 60 farming households here

311
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:52,240
in Guyan Farmstead.

312
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,000
Until now,

313
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,560
we still owe the farm rental fees and loans.

314
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,920
The previous loan was not done yet,

315
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,600
I don't know how to explain.

316
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,160
I would like to seek pointers from Big Madam.

317
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,080
What was the total owed?

318
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,600
For the rentals that's been dragged

319
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,640
for so many years

320
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,480
I'm guessing around 20,000 taels.

321
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,800
Also, people eat grains,

322
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,400
so they would also be sick.

323
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,350
When the farmers can't support

324
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,360
their family's expenses,

325
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,440
they would borrow money.

326
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,100
Calculating them,

327
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,875
it would approximately

328
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:26,860
reach 13,000 to 15,000.

329
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,160
That much?

330
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,600
Not mentioning the others.

331
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,640
There are also some nobles

332
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,680
who came here to borrow money.

333
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,280
Adding them all up,

334
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,525
it would more or less

335
00:14:39,525 --> 00:14:41,000
be around 13,000 to 14,000.

336
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,600
This farmstead was just granted

337
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,960
as a reward at the start of this year.

338
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,200
Those accounts are from

339
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,920
the Imperial family

340
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,440
and are irrelevant to Big Madam.

341
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,440
Big Madam, don't worry.

342
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,560
This is a difficult task.

343
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,720
Manager Wu,

344
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,320
you must help me come up with ideas.

345
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,760
Big Madam, don't worry.

346
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,600
These messy miscellaneous things

347
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,920
will eventually be properly handled.

348
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,320
As long as long as

349
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,240
I'm here for even one day.

350
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,240
How is this a reward?

351
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,625
The Emperor clearly just disposed

352
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:06,280
of himself a terrible mess!

353
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,320
And he even included some termites with it.

354
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,320
What a hoodlum! A scoundrel!

355
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,600
Who caused Big Madam

356
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,680
to be furious?

357
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,440
Why are there so many promissory notes here?

358
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,600
Aren't you supposed to be

359
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,525
in the camp in the western suburbs

360
00:16:34,525 --> 00:16:35,000
for these few days?

361
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,640
Why are you back again?

362
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,240
The drill has ended.

363
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,360
I was worried about you

364
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,640
and came back to see you.

365
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,800
Those farmstead in your dowry

366
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,600
will surely be fine.

367
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,400
Your grandmother

368
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,960
meticulously chose them for you.

369
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,800
But these farmstead were obtained

370
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,360
from punishments.

371
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,080
They surely will be hard to handle.

372
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,880
They are also not originally from my family.

373
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,440
I just

374
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,550
accepted them blindly.

375
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,080
There surely will be a pile of problems.

376
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,200
Not only are there problems,

377
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,880
there are too many of them!

378
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,000
They threatened me.

379
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,680
They had no fear and threatened me!

380
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,680
Who dared to threaten my wife?

381
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,425
I'll go and beat him up

382
00:17:19,425 --> 00:17:20,360
to help you vent your anger.

383
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:24,680
Forget it.

384
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,240
You are busy with your military matters

385
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,000
and also looking for the whereabouts of Chang'er.

386
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,640
You have enough problems.

387
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,720
Little weasel.

388
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,240
Didn't you say that you only want the inside

389
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,520
and not the appearance?

390
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:42,920
You're hitting your face to make it swollen

391
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,280
so you can act as a fatty.

392
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,160
Tell me.

393
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,840
Which great turmoil

394
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,822
haven't I seen?

395
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,550
I can handle

396
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,670
these people.

397
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,480
Tell me.

398
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,400
Alright.

399
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,000
The issue at Heishan Farmstead is not that big.

400
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,080
I can handle it on my own.

401
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,240
But Gu Yuan Farmstead

402
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,600
is too evil.

403
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,760
That

404
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,160
Wu Guang

405
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,600
is a sinister man.

406
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,000
Let's not talk about how he caught the men

407
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,880
whom I secretly sent there.

408
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,280
He even threatened me.

409
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,800
He said

410
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,160
if I don't let him continue to manage,

411
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:22,000
he will

412
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,560
shake off all the debts

413
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,000
that our farmstead owned.

414
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,480
Also, he delivered

415
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,840
a chest of promissory notes.

416
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,560
Did he let you check the accounts?

417
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,160
After I just settled in,

418
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,240
he already asked people

419
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,800
to deliver these records

420
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,920
and accounting books here.

421
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,760
After scanning them,

422
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,640
those are all big messes!

423
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,480
Not one is distinct and clear.

424
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,160
These are all bad debt.

425
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,760
Just because he's a relative

426
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,000
of a high-ranking palace eunuch,

427
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,280
he then manipulated power

428
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,360
for personal interest and plundered.

429
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,880
The farmers here in this farmstead

430
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,160
must have a hard life as well.

431
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,480
Why are you looking at me?

432
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,080
You are beautiful.

433
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,720
I've never seen you

434
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,920
fill with righteous indignation like this

435
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,440
and baring your fangs.

436
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,320
This is Sheng Minglan.

437
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,080
Look at how furious I am

438
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,440
and you are still laughing at me.

439
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,280
Alright, okay.

440
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,400
I.

441
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,280
You deal with that rotten mess yourself!

442
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,400
Don't be angry.

443
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,160
Don't ruin your health

444
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,120
just because of this minor matter.

445
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,800
I'll meet Wu Guang tomorrow

446
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,920
and see what kind of a person

447
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,000
he is.

448
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,320
We originally agreed

449
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,225
that you'll handle the outside,

450
00:19:47,225 --> 00:19:47,920
while I handle the inside.

451
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,920
We're supposed to have our own duties.

452
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,600
I can't help you with your external problems.

453
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,800
Don't tell me you want to

454
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,760
manage the internal problems too?

455
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,000
Then you will suffer by marrying me.

456
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,960
It's my expertise to be the evil man.

457
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,680
Moreover, these royal farmsteads

458
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,040
can't be counted as family matters.

459
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,280
It should be considered as matters of the country.

460
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,680
You're not using me

461
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,640
to find some amusement, right?

462
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,440
Who's doing that?

463
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:20,920
Let me ask you,

464
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,160
what's the most profitable business

465
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,120
in this kingdom?

466
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,400
What's the best profession?

467
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,320
To summarize, it should be

468
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,600
salt, mining, border trading,

469
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,800
sea and canal transportation.

470
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,680
But

471
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,600
these are controlled

472
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,560
by the Imperial court.

473
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,120
Who then do you think

474
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,600
is in charge of

475
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,240
all these commodities businesses?

476
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,240
I don't know

477
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,400
whose hands they are in,

478
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,120
but they are probably not

479
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,880
in the hands of His Majesty.

480
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,080
In the current empire,

481
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,120
the most important matter is money.

482
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,720
Now, there are a lot of money,

483
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,440
but most of them aren't in the state treasury.

484
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,800
the second is army.

485
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,880
Although there is an army

486
00:21:12,376 --> 00:21:14,520
but there are not

487
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,520
many people who can deploy and command it.

488
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,560
Although the Emperor is sitting on his throne.

489
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,850
Many things that he said,

490
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:20,840
can't be carried through.

491
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,320
Even this land owned by the Imperial family,

492
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,200
he can't get involved in it either.

493
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,440
Think about it.

494
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,680
This insignificant person, Wu Guang,

495
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,760
even dared to flaunt his prowess before you.

496
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,760
Is this still considered a family matter?

497
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,720
Since it's a matter of the country,

498
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,920
don't worry about this.

499
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,280
Let me manage this.

500
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,600
You are tired for the whole day.

501
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,680
Take a bath and change your clothes first.

502
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,600
I'm perspiring all over.

503
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,760
Do I stink?

504
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,100
You will feel more comfortable

505
00:21:59,100 --> 00:21:59,720
after taking bath. Let's go.

506
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:00,840
Okay.

507
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,080
I will personally serve you.

508
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,360
Alright.

509
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,200
It's too hot.

510
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,200
It's okay.

511
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,040
Add more cold water.

512
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,080
Come here.

513
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,480
When taking a bath, the hotter the better.

514
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,920
Are you injured?

515
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,400
I'm not.

516
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,880
What are you looking at?

517
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,240
Are you referring to that?

518
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,400
It's not.

519
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,520
When I was training the soldiers today,

520
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,520
someone was accidentally injured.

521
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,160
I helped to carry him.

522
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,720
His body was stained with blood.

523
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,640
It's not mine.

524
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,960
Your husband has a long life.

525
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,560
He won't die that easily.

526
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,480
Don't say that.

527
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,120
What if

528
00:23:18,075 --> 00:23:18,720
What if something

529
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,760
bad happens to you?

530
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,960
I'm still relying on you

531
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,400
for the rest of my life.

532
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,960
Do you know that previously,

533
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,640
when my finger

534
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,120
almost touched the King of Hell,

535
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,280
he didn't take me in.

536
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,400
Tell me, what could still possibly happen?

537
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,920
What about this time then?

538
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,560
I'm asking you! What about this time?

539
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,240
It's better that

540
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,120
not to let you know this kind of matter.

541
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,600
What are you doing?

542
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,920
Why am I putting on my clothes?

543
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,040
Not taking a bath anymore?

544
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,560
You are not taking a bath anymore.

545
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,520
This place is not sealed properly.

546
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,720
What if you catch a cold?

547
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,960
Take a bath when we are back at the manor.

548
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,720
Wife,

549
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,400
do you love your husband that much?

550
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,920
You will fall sick if you catch a cold.

551
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,280
The huge assets of this general manor

552
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,920
were all obtained by you risking your life.

553
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,400
I will help you guard them well.

554
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,040
Wife,

555
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,880
when I was in Lingnan,

556
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,440
I heard a story.

557
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,240
It said there was a wife

558
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,320
whose husband cheated on her.

559
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,040
When she found out,

560
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,560
she was afraid and angry too.

561
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,480
Hence,

562
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,280
she planted a kind of plant

563
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,920
in their garden.

564
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,320
Every day when she cooked,

565
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,160
she added it into her husband's soup.

566
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,480
Her husband died in six months

567
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,800
after drinking that.

568
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,160
They couldn't find the poison

569
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,680
in his body.

570
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,760
Do you know

571
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,280
this is a special kind of herb?

572
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,280
It's called the Return of Spring.

573
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,880
It kills people without any traces.

574
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,000
Don't tell me about this.

575
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:31,755
This,

576
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,320
This story is not nice.

577
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,200
It's scary.

578
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,520
In the future, if I

579
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,880
If I also have an love affair,

580
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,280
you can also use that

581
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,760
Return of Spring to poison me.

582
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,720
Don't show any mercy.

583
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,720
Why I want your life?

584
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,400
I'm leaving my life

585
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,640
in your hands.

586
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,800
Don't,

587
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,320
don't do this to me.

588
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,600
It's very scary.

589
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,760
Greetings, General.

590
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,400
I wonder why

591
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,280
you called us here so early in the morning?

592
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,760
What's this for?

593
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,240
It's nothing that important.

594
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,712
My wife came to check the accounts yesterday.

595
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,360
The accounts were messy and not proper.

596
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,400
When she went home, she was furious

597
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,560
and fell sick.

598
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,240
I had to come

599
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,160
to manage the issue here.

600
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,280
General, please do not be angry.

601
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,550
The situation hasn't been good

602
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,440
for the past few years.

603
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,400
If the harvest is lacking, we have to seek a loan.

604
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,680
When there's a deficit,

605
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,960
I'm helpless too.

606
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,880
Is that so?

607
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,440
For Manager Wu to care about the farmers like this

608
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,440
is really their great fortune.

609
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,560
A few days ago,

610
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,750
my wife went to check the accounts

611
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,360
at Heishan Farm.

612
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:04,120
She rewarded the farmers

613
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,200
with a string of coins each.

614
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,880
I think that we shouldn't give unfair treatment.

615
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,840
Call them here

616
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,080
to receive their rewards accordingly too.

617
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,960
I thank the General on their behalf.

618
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,950
But, this farmstead is too huge

619
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,560
with only a few populace.

620
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,040
If we're going to call them one by one,

621
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,280
it might take some time.

622
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,320
It's better to just hand over the money

623
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,200
to the managers

624
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,640
and let them distribute instead.

625
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,440
No need.

626
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,000
I have already gotten someone

627
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,960
to get them to come here.

628
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,600
Hurry up!

629
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,120
Let's go. Quick!

630
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,640
Hurry up, move!

631
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,280
Informing General,

632
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,480
there were guard

633
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,000
s and hired thugs around the farming households.

634
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,280
We have already taken care of them.

635
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,720
Today,

636
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,040
I called you here

637
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,200
one is for rewarding you.

638
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,840
And the other is for asking you

639
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,680
how is your life

640
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,200
in these past years.

641
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,240
Did you suffer any extortion or unfair treatment

642
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,800
from your managers?

643
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,400
Don't be afraid. Tell me directly.

644
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,160
His Majesty has given Gu Yuan Farmstead to me

645
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,240
as a reward.

646
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,080
I'm the landlord here now.

647
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,640
All the managers will be replaced.

648
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,440
Your land deeds and are

649
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,480
in my hands now.

650
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,325
You only need to listen

651
00:29:05,325 --> 00:29:06,440
to my instructions from now on.

652
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,640
No need to care about others.

653
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,640
Speak.

654
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,680
General, help us.

655
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,200
Our rent for the land here

656
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,440
is two to three times higher than

657
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,320
other imperial farmstead.

658
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:25,633
That' s right.

659
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,960
Manager Wu also made us

660
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,120
do personal labor for him.

661
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,087
During new years and holidays,

662
00:29:30,087 --> 00:29:31,480
they would ask for money and people.

663
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,240
If not he would come up with a reason to

664
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,400
increase our rent.

665
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,240
That's right.

666
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,920
There are a few managers who are maniacs.

667
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,200
They've raped so many ladies,

668
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,160
and even raped my wife!

669
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,600
Because the rentals are too heavy,

670
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,560
we don't really have much remaining grains

671
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,520
during the good year.

672
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,560
Older people couldn't bear to eat them

673
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,720
and some even starved to death.

674
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,880
General,

675
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,880
during the coldest days of the year,

676
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,880
our family didn't have any rice or fire woods.

677
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,160
Without any fire woods,

678
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,600
we can only use a few tattered clothes

679
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,000
to shield ourselves from the cold.

680
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,000
It's really not being able

681
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,760
to get down from the bed

682
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,440
or go out the house after wearing them.

683
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,200
Last year, my grandchild

684
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,440
died because of

685
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,640
starvation and cold.

686
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,800
That's right, General.

687
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,160
Even in this condition,

688
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,240
we still need

689
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,200
to work every day.

690
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,960
I have been coughing

691
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,920
out sputum and blood,

692
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,280
I still need to work every day.

693
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:18,938
Even if our feet are rotten from the chill,

694
00:30:18,938 --> 00:30:20,680
we still have to work in the fields.

695
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,840
The children at home are all cold and starving,

696
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,840
all crying their hearts out,

697
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,880
and we still need to work.

698
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,880
We all want to file a complaint,

699
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,360
but Manager Wu

700
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,920
has connections with the local officials

701
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,200
and has hired hoodlums under him.

702
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,760
He monitored our every moves.

703
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,480
We couldn't get out of this village at all!

704
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,000
If this continues,

705
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,600
we will

706
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,120
die here.

707
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,120
That's right, General.

708
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:45,360
General, help us.

709
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,000
General, help us.

710
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,000
General, help us.

711
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,680
Shitou.

712
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,320
Yes.

713
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,175
Has the local magistrate

714
00:30:52,175 --> 00:30:53,040
and his secretary arrived yet?

715
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,840
Yes, they are at the back.

716
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,520
Tell them to come forward.

717
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,200
Yes.

718
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,560
General, the state judgement officials are here.

719
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,000
General.

720
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,080
Manager Wu,

721
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,360
should we investigate each

722
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,320
and every houses

723
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,480
of these farmers

724
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,160
for they might have exaggerated their plight?

725
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,760
General, don't forget.

726
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,600
This farmstead

727
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,440
still has a huge credit

728
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,480
that hasn't been collected.

729
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,440
If we are dragged

730
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,800
to the local government office

731
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,160
and sentenced, if this news travel out,

732
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,200
it's the Imperial family

733
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,480
that will get embarrassed!

734
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,440
Did you come up with those lines?

735
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,360
I'm sure it was said

736
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,600
by your uncle from the palace.

737
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,120
As a corrupt eunuch officer who accepts bribes,

738
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,240
what dignity does he still need?

739
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,080
I invited the both of you here

740
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,040
to be witnesses.

741
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,200
These account books of Guyan Farmstead

742
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:40,840
are so messed up.

743
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,640
I'm a very straightforward person.

744
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:43,840
I'm not willing to

745
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,600
scramble within dirty mud and ditches.

746
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,160
The more I don't want to

747
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,150
fight for food with stinky fishes

748
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:48,720
and rotten shrimps.

749
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,000
Since it's a bad debt,

750
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,840
it should be burnt.

751
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,760
The money that they owed,

752
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,720
they are all cancelled.

753
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,920
I will make it up.

754
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,760
Change the manager

755
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,760
immediately!

756
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,360
Thank you, General, for saving us.

757
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,760
Thank you, General.

758
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,080
Thank you, General.

759
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,320
Still angry?

760
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,120
Not only can't we sentence that

761
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,000
mastermind Wu Guang for his crimes,

762
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,480
you even gave him a big sum of money

763
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,320
to let him leave.

764
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,480
I'm angry when I think about this.

765
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,120
For the deficit, I

766
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,120
I can give my own money to balance it.

767
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,725
But we need to protect the dignity

768
00:34:04,725 --> 00:34:05,480
of the royal family too.

769
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,240
Wu Guang and those accomplices of him

770
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,840
have managers here for so many years.

771
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,300
The tree they've planted

772
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:10,960
has already grown tall and deep.

773
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,540
If you continue to investigate,

774
00:34:13,545 --> 00:34:15,240
it will involve a vast number of people.

775
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,560
It's still not time

776
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,280
to punish these thieves.

777
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,600
We must prioritize everything.

778
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,800
I know.

779
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,800
I'm just angry.

780
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,280
He did so many bad deeds

781
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,080
yet he still was able to escape the law

782
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,000
safe and sound.

783
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,760
This is unfair.

784
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,640
Safe and sound?

785
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,200
Not like that.

786
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,760
You were able to pacify the trouble

787
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,280
and didn't end up being hated.

788
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,480
Regarding the incident at Gu Yuan,

789
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,760
you handled it perfectly.

790
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,280
About those evil managers,

791
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,120
I heard that

792
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,200
after they have received the money

793
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:14,880
and left the village,

794
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,480
they were robbed not long after that.

795
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,840
Their legs were also broke.

796
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,440
They will be crippled for the rest of their lives.

797
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,960
What's going on?

798
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,825
Those Wu Guang and his accomplices

799
00:35:30,825 --> 00:35:32,080
have committed all kinds of evil.

800
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,840
This is retribution from God.

801
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,320
I don't know

802
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,440
what's going on too.

803
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,960
Frankly, I'm a bit scared.

804
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,000
I'm also afraid that he's

805
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,880
always swaying at the teeth of the storm.

806
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,200
Only after inspecting the farmstead

807
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,600
did I learn

808
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,960
that although

809
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,975
our new emperor is highly respected

810
00:35:51,975 --> 00:35:52,480
as the son of god,

811
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,360
he also has a lot of predicaments.

812
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,640
I don't know

813
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,320
about the predicaments of the emperor,

814
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,880
but your father

815
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,720
indeed has a problem right now.

816
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,000
Just to find Changfeng a bride,

817
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,640
he and Big Madam

818
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,800
have been arguing lately.

819
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,600
What's wrong?

820
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,160
Big Madam wants to

821
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,880
just randomly pick a family.

822
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,520
Your father still has to

823
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,000
be meticulous about it.

824
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,560
As for Changfeng,

825
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,500
he's complaining that the ladies being considered

826
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,520
aren't beautiful enough.

827
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,200
During the matchmaking,

828
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,120
he bowed his head and wouldn't agree.

829
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,025
This will probably still go on

830
00:36:40,025 --> 00:36:40,560
for quite some time.

831
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,560
Why don't you go back early tomorrow?

832
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,760
Once they're done with this fuss,

833
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,240
come back again and keep me company.

834
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,320
From what I heard,

835
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,520
the farmstead of him

836
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,440
was found to

837
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,680
have a huge deficit.

838
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,800
Won't he

839
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,920
has suffered losses then?

840
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,240
The Gu Family triggered without shooting.

841
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,190
They only exposed the

842
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,000
evil crimes of the managers

843
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,600
in the royal farmstead.

844
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,680
Now His Majesty

845
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,240
must be so happy.

846
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,080
In the future, he'll have a reason

847
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,400
to layoff people

848
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,840
and insert his own trusted aides.

849
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,200
Among the trusted aides of His Majesty,

850
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,000
only Second Gu

851
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,760
has the extra hand

852
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,160
to take care of this situation.

853
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,280
His Majesty has already thought it clearly.

854
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,200
With Second Gu's style of always

855
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,680
putting the general situation first,

856
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,080
His Majesty surely knows of it.

857
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,360
Among the trusted aides that

858
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,040
came with His Majesty

859
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,000
before his coronation,

860
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,240
he is the most intelligent.

861
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,100
A person from the marquis manor,

862
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,400
well-versed in both literary and fighting skills,

863
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,775
It won't be that easy to

864
00:38:03,775 --> 00:38:05,000
go against him in the future.

865
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,280
Useless rascal.

866
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,680
Why do I need servants

867
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,840
like you?!

868
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,080
My Yong'er is the son of the emperor,

869
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,840
a person of noble birth.

870
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,640
You're just giving him

871
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,360
these kinds of food?

872
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,720
He can't even have some milk.

873
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,000
Are you looking down at us

874
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,040
for not having a strong maiden family backing?

875
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,080
Just because of this,

876
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,600
is it worth creating such a drama?

877
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,400
The prince of Noble Consort Liu

878
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,600
used to have three wet nurses.

879
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,080
Two are gone

880
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,360
and only one is left.

881
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,200
For this matter, Noble Consort Liu

882
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,680
is very angry.

883
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,200
She's been causing such a scene for days already.

884
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,240
This emperor really

885
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,000
doesn't know to weigh the pros and cons.

886
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:48,550
It's fine to limit

887
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,430
the usage of other people.

888
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,560
A prince is still young.

889
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,000
He should treat him kindly and generously.

890
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,600
He's after all was just forced up the throne.

891
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,400
I've instructed him so many times

892
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,200
to follow the governance of the past emperor.

893
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,800
He refused to listen.

894
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,320
Now, even the people around him

895
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,320
are making such a ruckus.

896
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,800
His Majesty didn't order any reduction

897
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,480
in expenses of our palace.

898
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,400
I believe

899
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,760
he's still filial towards you.

900
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,920
Forget it.

901
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,920
Not following my advice for major matters,

902
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,840
but fawning on me for small matters.

903
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,720
I won't appreciate this filial piety of his.

904
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,000
Let him just decrease the usage of everyone.

905
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,040
How long have you been in the palace?

906
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,960
More than six years.

907
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,600
The weather is getting warmer.

908
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,960
Cats and dogs have found their partners too.

909
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,548
It's time to think about

910
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,160
where you all should go next.

911
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,040
Don't!

912
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,100
If this was usual days,

913
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:23,960
I would let you do my make-up.

914
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,040
But today is the first time we're

915
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:26,825
entering the palace to thank His Majesty's graces

916
00:40:26,825 --> 00:40:27,240
since the start of spring.

917
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,720
We mustn't make it sloppy.

918
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,920
Now it's getting late,

919
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,160
if I still allow you to do this

920
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,120
and you ruin it,

921
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,320
I have to do it again.

922
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,640
What is there to fear?

923
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,075
The current empress is

924
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,155
the gentlest and kindest lady in this world.

925
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,120
When I was still in Yuzhou,

926
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:43,800
I would go to her

927
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,160
whenever I'm hungry.

928
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,920
Knowing that you're my wife,

929
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,200
she surely won't be very strict with you.

930
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,920
That was in the past.

931
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,360
We can't be

932
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,160
so unbridled now.

933
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,000
Why don't

934
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,280
I go with you then?

935
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,760
It's against the rule. It's not good.

936
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,840
Fortunately, Older Sister Shen is going with me.

937
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,120
As a guide,

938
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,280
she already knows the palace very well.

939
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,440
When I'm at the palace,

940
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,920
I will just talk less

941
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,040
and bow more often.

942
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,360
Whatever I shouldn't ask, I won't.

943
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,240
And don't bring up whatever I shouldn't.

944
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:26,840
I will pretend to be stupid.

945
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,160
I'm good at this.

946
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,360
Little fox is trying to pretend

947
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,720
to be a meek lamb again.

948
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,440
I'm not a little fox!

949
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,880
With me here, what are you afraid of?

950
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,480
My older sister

951
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,080
is the kindest person.

952
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,720
When I was young, I always lost my shoes

953
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,640
and made my dress dirty.

954
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,040
She has never blamed me.

955
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,760
With you being so gentle and beautiful,

956
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,120
She will definitely like you.

957
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,400
Since young till now,

958
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,840
I have only been to the imperial city once.

959
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,960
It was very scary.

960
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,880
No big deal.

961
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,840
Look, we only came

962
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,280
from Yuzhou a while ago.

963
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,360
You are more familiar about

964
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,880
the rules in the palace than me.

965
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,520
But my older sister is the empress now.

966
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,560
and your are Second Brother Gu's wife.

967
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,240
Who would dare to say anything?

968
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,480
Don't be afraid.

969
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,420
Look, your husband

970
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,480
is following you.

971
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,560
He must be afraid that you'll cower.

972
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,160
My husband

973
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,880
is not that caring.

974
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,040
He really treats me very well.

975
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,320
He didn't need to

976
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,160
treat me that well.

977
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,000
Why can't he treat you well?

978
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,960
If my husband is like this,

979
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,560
I would even smile in my dream.

980
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,800
I'm just afraid that I don't know

981
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,360
how to repay him in the future.

982
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,120
Repay?

983
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,160
A husband and wife is of one body.

984
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,720
There's no need to repay!
