00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Ming Lan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,580
Episode 44

3
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:04,240
Please.

4
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,800
Thank you, Nanny.

5
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,600
Good wine.

6
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,160
Enjoy it.

7
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:15,640
Nanny.

8
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,560
you're too courteous.

9
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,040
You are treating us way too good.

10
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,080
You are the nanny of Master,

11
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,400
You are in a high position,

12
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,800
yet you still treat us with some drink.

13
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,760
I really feel flattered.

14
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,160
Isn't that right?

15
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,520
I don't care about positions.

16
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,640
Young Master Ye and I

17
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,480
have never put any importance

18
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,800
to those so-called seniority rules.

19
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,880
You can say so,

20
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,200
but we're

21
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,560
still working for the inner courtyard.

22
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,920
No matter how good Master is,

23
00:01:48,162 --> 00:01:49,317
we are out of the master's reach.

24
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,400
Big Madam is our boss.

25
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,120
Big Madam

26
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,040
isn't as resolute as Master.

27
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,480
Look at how chaotic

28
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,640
the kitchen has become.

29
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,240
She doesn't even ask about it.

30
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,520
Indeed.

31
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,760
Today, Rong

32
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,440
wants to eat swamp eel,

33
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,040
I then went to the kitchen to ask if there was any.

34
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,000
Before I even entered,

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,520
I've already heard Nanny Lai yelling.

36
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,560
Her words were really unbearable.

37
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,720
Even a woman from the countryside like me

38
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,600
felt embarrassed.

39
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,880
And this person even came from

40
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,000
the marquis house.

41
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,760
She claims that she's a person

42
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,800
who has attended to Big Madam

43
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,520
of the marquis hourse,

44
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,520
but I don't think so.

45
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,280
Those dowry servants that Big Madam

46
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,760
brought with her from Qin Manor

47
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,920
were mostly

48
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,520
gone or dead.

49
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,080
Only Nanny Xiang

50
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,040
is by her side.

51
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,920
I am really puzzled.

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,560
What is the background

53
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,000
of this Nanny Lai?

54
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,800
So barbaric.

55
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,040
I heard that

56
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,000
she came here

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,760
with Nanny Xiang's help.

58
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,600
Because she has

59
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,560
served longer than us,

60
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,040
hence, she was able to look so decent.

61
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,920
Let me tell you,

62
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,000
she keeps showing off,

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,360
that she's a trusted maid of Big Madam.

64
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,920
What's to be proud of this?

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,400
In my opinion,

66
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,000
you two

67
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,960
are not worse than her.

68
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,480
Why must you two have lower positon than her?

69
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,920
We work for the fourth and fifth house,

70
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,700
who are not as prestigious

71
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,680
as the main house.

72
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,920
Speaking of this,

73
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,100
before going to the western expedition,

74
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,520
do you know

75
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,840
how Young Master

76
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,960
was able to become a general overnight?

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,550
Wasn't it because he was meritorious

78
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,560
for saving the emperor?

79
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,880
The current emperor

80
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,560
was still an unfavored one.

81
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,150
Afterwards, there was a palace siege

82
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,240
to usurp the throne.

83
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,400
It was Young Master

84
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,920
who risked his life to escort His Majesty,

85
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,320
and fought all out against the rebels,

86
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,800
hence, he has his current prestige.

87
00:03:59,754 --> 00:04:01,040
If that time,

88
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,800
Young Master was afraid of dying

89
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,920
and just hid in Yuzhou to preserve his life,

90
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,400
can he have such success today?

91
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,150
Can he have this enormous wealth

92
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:09,960
and high status now?

93
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,320
What Nanny means is...

94
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,200
Every time a new emperor ascends,

95
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,120
the ministers are changed.

96
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,080
If you two can unit

97
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,120
to pull down Nanny Lai,

98
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,280
a thorn in Big Madam's side,

99
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,720
will she treat you two unfairly?

100
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,880
You cowards.

101
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,720
Whether you do it or not,

102
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,040
I'm still the nanny of our master.

103
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,717
Who in this house

104
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,157
can have a position higher than me?

105
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,680
You don't

106
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,760
listen to the good words I say.

107
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,760
When bandits join a group,

108
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,520
they will show their loyalty and devotion first.

109
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,480
Fine.

110
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,200
You two are indeed

111
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,840
just suitable to drink wine in this garden,

112
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,520
What Nanny said is right.

113
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,440
Nanny said it right.

114
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,720
Yes, Nanny,

115
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,400
we remember your words.

116
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,012
Come, Nanny,

117
00:05:22,012 --> 00:05:23,480
let me give you a toast.

118
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,120
I caught something!

119
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,080
I've caught it! I've caught it!

120
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,280
Let me do it.

121
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,280
After catching plenty of fish,

122
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,840
we'll have something to eat with wines tonight.

123
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,120
Since I came to the capital

124
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,360
with elder Sister and Brother-in-law,

125
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,280
this has been my happiest day.

126
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,760
No need to restrain myself

127
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,120
and consider the opinion of those elders.

128
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,600
I also don't need to keep my head

129
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,800
from shaking when walking,

130
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,600
or showing my teeth when laughing,

131
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,200
as if I'm some demure lady.

132
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,400
Come here often then.

133
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,500
You're the only one left

134
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,720
that doesn't mind me being wild.

135
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,880
In the capital City,

136
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,200
all rich daughters

137
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,600
are courteous

138
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,640
before me,

139
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,520
but mocking me

140
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,880
as a country bumpkin behind my back?

141
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,760
Let alone fishing,

142
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,320
Even if I just talk a bit louder,

143
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,840
they will laugh at me.

144
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,080
Sometimes, I didn't even know

145
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,440
that they were laughing at me.

146
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,880
I even laughed with them.

147
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,320
You're also laughing at me?

148
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,840
The two of us can get along well.

149
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,280
You and a cousin of mine in our home province

150
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,800
are of similar age and personality.

151
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,600
She is also wild when she plays and runs.

152
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,560
She can climb trees to get bird's eggs

153
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,800
or dive into the river to catch toads.

154
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,160
She can do all those.

155
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,425
In our home province, she's the person

156
00:07:02,425 --> 00:07:03,400
that I'm able to get along with the most.

157
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,840
Once she comes to visit me,

158
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,520
I'll tell her to play with you.

159
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,040
The capital is almost killing me

160
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,320
with suffocating rules.

161
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,720
Don't know

162
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,560
if I can still live

163
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,360
until your cousin arrives.

164
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,600
It's indeed a good thing

165
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,320
that brother-in-law of mine

166
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,360
became the emperor.

167
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,040
But it feels like shackles

168
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,000
have been placed on me.

169
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,400
If I make any mistake,

170
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,960
I would be bringing trouble to my whole family.

171
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,640
Aristocratic families are indeed like that.

172
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,280
They are deeply entangled.

173
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,200
One committing a mistake

174
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,200
will affect everyone else.

175
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:34,800
Good thing,

176
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,240
you were married into the Zheng Family.

177
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,680
Your in-laws are all from reputable families.

178
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,920
As days pass by,

179
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,600
everyone will know

180
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,560
that you have a pure and kind temperament.

181
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,720
They will eventually accept you.

182
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,160
Xiaotao,

183
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,200
take these fish to the kitchen.

184
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,760
Let's just go around.

185
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,120
We haven't been to even a half of

186
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,840
this huge garden yet.

187
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,720
Sure!

188
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,280
In the kitchen,

189
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,080
I'm the one in charge after all.

190
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,920
I'm just getting a few of

191
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,800
these rotten leafy vegetables.

192
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,200
Do you have to comment so much?

193
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,960
Rotten leafy vegetables?

194
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,080
All these were raised and cared

195
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,840
for idling people

196
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,200
like us in the garden.

197
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,120
They are for the Miss Rong's soup.

198
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,550
Just for saying

199
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,600
that it's a rotten leafy vegetable,

200
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,560
you want to take it away?

201
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,560
Are you more respectable

202
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,720
than our Miss?

203
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,240
I...

204
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,720
Isn't it just a few wild vegetables?

205
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,840
If I eat yours,

206
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,840
I'll just get you

207
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,640
some to make it up.

208
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,560
Is it necessary to make a fuss like that?

209
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,794
Say,

210
00:08:31,794 --> 00:08:32,200
just let it go.

211
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,400
just for a few leafy vegetables,

212
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,600
Stop fighting.

213
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,440
Make it up?!

214
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,480
If Big Madam asks,

215
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,600
how would I explain it?

216
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,360
You know very clearly

217
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,200
that this is not about just a few wild vegetables.

218
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,800
Since you got in charge of the kitchen,

219
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,000
how many items have been converted to silver

220
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,040
and entered your pocket.

221
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,040
Can you explain those clearly?!

222
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,480
You...

223
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,000
stop using Big Madam to oppress me!

224
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,760
I didn't eat yours

225
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,760
or spend your money,

226
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,760
so why are you being hurt?

227
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,840
I think

228
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,080
you're just jealous

229
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,840
because others are getting kickbacks

230
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,160
while you're not.

231
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,560
Getting agitated about it.

232
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:02,950
You've already gotten advantages

233
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:03,400
and you still pretend to be nice?!

234
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:03,960
I'll beat you flat!

235
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,680
Do you believe that?!

236
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,960
What are you doing?!

237
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,440
You people want to beat me up?!

238
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,920
Hit her until she dies! Get out! Leave!

239
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,120
Stinky brat!

240
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,080
Go away!

241
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,440
You are really so bold! You!

242
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,800
Stop! Stop!

243
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,960
You are the person I want to punch!

244
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Stop!

245
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,040
Stop pulling me! Get off!

246
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,120
Did a thief enter your house?

247
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,321
No.

248
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,880
It must be the senior kitchen maids

249
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,880
fighting again.

250
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,600
Forget it.

251
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,720
Let's find a more peaceful place

252
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,400
to talk.

253
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,640
No, they are breaking things now.

254
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,840
Sister, you're not intervening?

255
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,240
I'll kill you!

256
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,440
You stinky brat!

257
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,800
I'll kill you!

258
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,960
Young Master! Young Master! We have trouble!

259
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,900
The people inside the inner courtyard kitchen

260
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,200
are fighting.

261
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,680
What happened?

262
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,480
I heard that it's about some wild vegetables.

263
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,800
Nanny Lai, Nanny Hua, Nanny Tian,

264
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,880
and a few more maidservants

265
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,000
are all fighting there!

266
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,160
Why are you telling me these?

267
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,000
Must I still meddle with

268
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,280
those trifle matters in the kitchen?

269
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,360
Where's Big Madam?

270
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,760
Tell her to go over there and take a look.

271
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,720
Big Madam doesn't dare to meddle.

272
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,520
She said that those are nannies sent

273
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,640
by the elders of the marquis house.

274
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,320
Then just forget it.

275
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,320
Is everything still okay?

276
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,440
It's fine, General.

277
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,040
You better go over and take a look.

278
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,720
What's there to look at?

279
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,850
A few elderly women are fighting

280
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,960
and I still have to meddle?

281
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,120
Just let them fight.

282
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,720
At most, let them trash the kitchen

283
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,600
and destroy its roof.

284
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,000
I'll just hire some people to rebuild it.

285
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,600
Let's just drink.

286
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,960
You, beat the drum!

287
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,360
Okay! Okay!

288
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,560
Right.

289
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,760
Just watching, isn't fun?

290
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,280
Sounding a few drums makes it more exciting.

291
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,280
One more time!

292
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,760
Emperor's Uncle Shen and his little sister

293
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,760
left happily.

294
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,040
Aren't you afraid

295
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,080
that Shen lady will gossip

296
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,200
how we are not strict in managing our house

297
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,960
that the maidservants here fight every day?

298
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,650
Making this place more lively

299
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:46,440
than the southern operas.

300
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,520
I just fear that she

301
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,960
might defend me

302
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,625
and argue with others

303
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:56,480
because we got along so well.

304
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,560
That's harder to handle.

305
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,640
Why?

306
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,360
She and I are both have a bad background.

307
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,700
It's only because of accidental fate

308
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,325
that we're able to make it

309
00:13:08,325 --> 00:13:08,800
to a higher social status.

310
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:10,900
Those people

311
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,080
from illustrious aristocratic families

312
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,080
will surely not believe her words.

313
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,575
They will think that she's being biased

314
00:13:15,575 --> 00:13:16,160
on the people like her.

315
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,200
Don't worry.

316
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,680
One day,

317
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,880
I will let those people

318
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,880
dare no more look down on you.

319
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,400
Since they have come,

320
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,320
we should make them comfortable.

321
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,640
Outside our home,

322
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,640
you've already given me

323
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,840
enough splendor and dignity.

324
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,960
For this small matter inside the house,

325
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,320
just let me

326
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,320
deal with it alone.

327
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,200
To resist foreign aggression,

328
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,080
pacify internal conflicts first.

329
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,920
Once the house is clean,

330
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,720
and then to restire our reputation outside

331
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,600
once our house

332
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,520
is clean.

333
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,760
The days are long.

334
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,720
No need to rush.

335
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,160
On a more serious note,

336
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,840
shouldn't you disperse

337
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,880
the maidservants outside now?

338
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,200
Danju,

339
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,840
go out and spread my order.

340
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,600
Big Madam instructed

341
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,880
that all people involved in the fight

342
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,360
can't be allowed to stay in the manor anymore.

343
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,650
Considering that you all are old servants

344
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:26,320
of the marquis manor,

345
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,750
it's also not convenient for us

346
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,440
to just expel you all out.

347
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,680
Tomorrow,

348
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,675
all are being transferred to

349
00:14:31,675 --> 00:14:32,800
the farmstead outside the city.

350
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,520
Miss Cuiwei,

351
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,800
we were seeking justice

352
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,760
for Big Madam

353
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,775
that's why we turned hostile against

354
00:14:43,775 --> 00:14:44,200
that Lai woman!

355
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,040
That's right!

356
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,400
We were seeking justice!

357
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:47,875
Even if you are,

358
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,080
you could have reasoned out properly.

359
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,600
Why must you use violence?

360
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,640
You all say

361
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,160
that you were seeking justice for Big Madam.

362
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,160
So this matter has

363
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,080
become the mistake of Big Madam then?

364
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,200
Tomorrow, if you kill a person,

365
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,960
will you be claiming

366
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,160
that you're seeking justice for general then?

367
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,800
What should we do?

368
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,040
Nanny, how's your injuries?

369
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,640
Do they still hurt?

370
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,200
With my old skin and face,

371
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,600
I'm fine.

372
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,975
I'm just afraid that Big Madam

373
00:15:35,975 --> 00:15:37,480
has gotten so mad about this.

374
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,600
Nanny, don't worry.

375
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,040
Big Madam has already punished

376
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,440
the people who have hurt you.

377
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,600
She had them transfer

378
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,840
to the farmstead outside the city

379
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,760
to do manual labor.

380
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,880
Those evil whores,

381
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,600
they really dared to cruelly hit me.

382
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,880
Big Madam is right to handle them that way.

383
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,600
But, with so many people leaving,

384
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,320
the manor will surely lack people.

385
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,400
Tomorrow, I must take care in

386
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,600
getting some new people in.

387
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,400
Big Madam said that since you're hurt,

388
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,680
don't worry about the household matters anymore.

389
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,240
Tonight, you'll be transferred to the farmstead

390
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,560
outside the city.

391
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,400
You just need to be at ease and recuperate.

392
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,560
No need for you to worry about other things.

393
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,800
No! No!

394
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,840
My injuries aren't serious.

395
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,840
When Big Madam gave the instructions,

396
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,760
Master was also there.

397
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,320
He then sent out his two servants

398
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,360
to escort you.

399
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,440
Nanny, stop being courteous.

400
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,325
Whether you leave now or later,

401
00:16:41,325 --> 00:16:42,400
you're still leaving.

402
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,640
You people are

403
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,800
all loyal ones.

404
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,960
With Nanny Lai and the others leaving,

405
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,520
Thoes empty positions

406
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,240
are making me be at my wits' end.

407
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,840
Everyone, please do your best to do them.

408
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,840
Madam, don't worry.

409
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,520
We always give it our best in doing our tasks.

410
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,600
What? marquis manor?

411
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,920
We don't acknowledge it at all.

412
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,040
In our eyes, there's only Big Madam.

413
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,120
We'll only listen to your orders.

414
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,480
I have to rely on everyone then.

415
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,280
You...

416
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,150
If you want to do a good hairstyle

417
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:44,720
on your daughter,

418
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,240
you should at least follow the norms.

419
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,840
Why did you make

420
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,000
her look like a lion?

421
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,680
Look.

422
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,240
Put on some hair oil,

423
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,240
then apply it like this.

424
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,120
Has it done?

425
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,400
So pretty.

426
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,760
Wife's fingers are like softstem bulrush,

427
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,360
so long and so pretty.

428
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,040
My fingers are like ginseng.

429
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,400
How could I better you in doing a hairstyle?

430
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,200
Not true.

431
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,640
There's an old maidservant in our house

432
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,480
whose 10 fingers are

433
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,360
so coarse and short like carrots.

434
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,800
But she does hairstyles the best.

435
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,400
She's able to do all

436
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,520
the best and latest hairstyles.

437
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,000
Hence,

438
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,550
this has nothing to do

439
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,400
with the coarseness of one's fingers.

440
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,240
If you want to do a great hairstyle,

441
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,840
you should practice more.

442
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,680
Don't blame on the fingers.

443
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,800
So pretty.

444
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,960
Okay. Okay. I'll practice more.

445
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,240
I'm preparing

446
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,640
to practice on my wife's hair.

447
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,080
Don't! Don't! Stop it!

448
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,040
You do not save me and are still laughing?!

449
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,480
Don't save her!

450
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,240
Save me!

451
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,000
Go away.

452
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,760
Miss.

453
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,640
Stop it!

454
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,440
Emmm...

455
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,120
I'm teaching your Big Madam

456
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,440
some defense moves.

457
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,400
Then I'll just come back

458
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,520
later.

459
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,000
Wait! Wait!

460
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,520
What is wrong?

461
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,760
Big Madam from the marquis manor is here.

462
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,600
She's here to denounce me for my faults.

463
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,320
Serve her tea first.

464
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,440
I'll be right there.

465
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,600
Yes.

466
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,680
You go first.

467
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,760
I'll then hide

468
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,560
and listen to what you two are saying.

469
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,600
If they bully you,

470
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,640
I'll come out and give you support.

471
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,800
You better just think about

472
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,600
how to fix her hair.

473
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,960
You decide on where to put those.

474
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,920
Hurry up!

475
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,960
This...how do you do this?

476
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,560
Nanny Lai is old

477
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,920
and severely injured,

478
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,575
I was afraid that she can't stand

479
00:20:18,575 --> 00:20:19,680
staying idle here in our house

480
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,520
and refuse to focus on recuperating.

481
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,240
Hence, I made the decision

482
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,000
to transfer her to the farmstead outside the city.

483
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,160
They are really so bold to disobey!

484
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,200
Nannies Lai, Diao, Hua, and Tian

485
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,720
are all behaved people

486
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,520
when they were

487
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,960
still in the marquis manor.

488
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,840
How come afte coming to your house,

489
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,600
they ended up this way?

490
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,200
Just sit down, my good child.

491
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,520
Maybe because in the marquis manor,

492
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,025
you're there in person

493
00:20:50,025 --> 00:20:50,840
attending to the household affairs,

494
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,360
they dare not do any mischief.

495
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,160
Upon coming here,

496
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,518
seeing how young I am

497
00:20:55,518 --> 00:20:56,640
and have such small authority,

498
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,840
I'm unable to control my servants.

499
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,960
They instead went mad.

500
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,080
It's all their fault.

501
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,760
How can it be mother-in-law's fault?

502
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,150
From now on,

503
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,920
I still must learn more principles of managing

504
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,320
the household from you.

505
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,560
Good thing,

506
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,240
among the people I've sent you,

507
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,040
there were still a few that's useful.

508
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,000
I've already asked around when I've arrived.

509
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,600
That one named Mingyue

510
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,960
and another one named Ruyue

511
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,360
didn't join the fight.

512
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,400
Especially that Mingyue,

513
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,400
when she learned that mother did that,

514
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,760
she even tried to stop her.,

515
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,160
but it didn't work.

516
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,800
This child,

517
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,040
in terms of looks and needlework,

518
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,840
she's really good.

519
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,240
She's also a very prudent person.

520
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,520
I think that she would be helpful to you.

521
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,840
Mother-in-law is right.

522
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,000
This maidservant is indeed not bad

523
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,120
and I know her background very well.

524
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,560
She surely will be a good helper.

525
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,240
I'm relieved

526
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,440
for you saying that.

527
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,600
If these maidservants

528
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,960
do anything inappropriate,

529
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,320
just have people tell me.

530
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,000
You are too shy.

531
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,520
You aren't bold enough to be hostile with them.

532
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,960
I'll deal with them for you.

533
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,920
With mother-in-law's words,

534
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,440
I feel so relieved.

535
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,200
I made you worry, mother-in-law.

536
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,240
No such thing.

537
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,280
You've just moved here.

538
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:18,950
There are still a lot of things

539
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:19,680
that you must handle in this house.

540
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,720
You just go back now.

541
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,680
Okay.

542
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,720
Go back.

543
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,800
Mother-in-law, take care.

544
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,360
go back, have a good way home.

545
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,040
Let's go.

546
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,440
That illegitimate daughter

547
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,040
is really formidable.

548
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,840
More than ten people we've sent,

549
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,880
and now, only two left.

550
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,200
It's good that there were two left.

551
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,840
Although Mingyue and Ruyue

552
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,960
are not that pretty,

553
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,280
that Second Gu

554
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,640
grew up in the alleys

555
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,920
of brothels.

556
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,400
He likes having someone new.

557
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,200
Even if he can endure it now,

558
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,200
can he still do in the future?

559
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,280
Too bad,

560
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,440
Nanny Lai and those others

561
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,800
who were trusted maides of ours

562
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,720
We have trained them for decades

563
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,720
But they actually ended up in failure.

564
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,720
There is a long wa to go.

565
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,000
This game of chess

566
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,160
has just reached the middle.

567
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,360
Daddy, I want to write by my own,

568
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,640
by my own.

569
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,120
Okay. Okay. Rong can write it by herself.

570
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,040
What are you laughing at?

571
00:23:53,554 --> 00:23:55,200
You can not kick out those two

572
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,360
remaining maidservants?

573
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,360
Yes.

574
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,520
She has already left her words.

575
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,520
Even if those two make any mistake,

576
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,040
I must first inform her.

577
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,040
If I kick them out,

578
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,320
that's turning one's back to my elder.

579
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,600
Turning your back to your elder?

580
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,800
She still has the nerve

581
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,840
to call herself your elder?

582
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,160
Anyway, I've turned my back against her

583
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,080
not just this time.

584
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,120
I'll talk to her!

585
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,640
No need to trouble you.

586
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,200
You still have some countermeasures?

587
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,200
As the main madam of this house,

588
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,450
you think it will be hard for me

589
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:31,120
to kick people out?

590
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,040
The only hard part

591
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,200
is not to let others have my flaws.

592
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,960
I must make it reasonable.

593
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,520
Don't you people who fight wars

594
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,640
also pay attention

595
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,880
to winning without fighting?

596
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,520
The next few days, the weather will be colder.

597
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,440
I'll then tell those two ladies

598
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,440
to go to Heishui Farmstead and visit Nanny Lai.

599
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,280
In handling the household,

600
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,320
you are even using the art of war.

601
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,480
Did I married a war master?

602
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,840
It's really too cold here.

603
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,375
There aren't even things

604
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:19,840
that can warm your hands and feet.

605
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,800
I really can't stay here anymore.

606
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,680
Didn't the marquis house

607
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,640
ask you to leave me a message?

608
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,440
They don't mind me

609
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,000
that much now.

610
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,200
They would only sometimes

611
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,120
tell me to do my work well.

612
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,840
Whether I'll be able to get a concubine position

613
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,440
will depend on my ability.

614
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,040
No matter how fierce the master is,

615
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,520
I must think of a way to make him like me.

616
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,960
Looks like Big Madam

617
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,480
has completely forgets about me.

618
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:53,720
Mother.

619
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,600
In the Cheng Garden now,

620
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,800
only me and Ruyue were left

621
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,640
in the group that came from the marquis house.

622
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,160
We are outnumbered.

623
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,200
Those people who were nice to us before

624
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,560
are afraid of getting implicated

625
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,560
and don't usually socialize with us.

626
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,240
People like us who lacks foundation

627
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,960
we can't even get near

628
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,320
in front of the Master.

629
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:21,920
Child,

630
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,840
do you want to go higher

631
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,800
and become the concubine of master?

632
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,680
I initially wanted to,

633
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,040
but that was in the courtyard of Young Master Wei.

634
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,240
Young Master Wei is easygoing

635
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,800
and easy to amuse.

636
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,560
But the current master...

637
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,840
Master is too fierce.

638
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,600
I'm afraid.

639
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,640
It looks like the two of us are not people

640
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,880
who can do great undertakings.

641
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,840
That Big Madam

642
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,040
saw that I'm now useless,

643
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,800
so she just threw me away

644
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,920
and didn't even show any care.

645
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,120
I've worked hard for her.

646
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,120
It's fine if you do your tasks successfully,

647
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,520
but once you fail,

648
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,400
she will never care about your live.

649
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,480
Mother, what should we do then?

650
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,240
That one in marquis manor

651
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,760
is a person who keeps her words.

652
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,400
If I don't follow her instructions

653
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,560
to seduce master,

654
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,840
she'll never let me off.

655
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,240
Child,

656
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,320
go and beg the current main madam.

657
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,480
I beg Big Madam to give me a path to live.

658
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,040
Don't be afraid.

659
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,480
I won't eat you.

660
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,920
If my husband really likes you,

661
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,960
I can't really stop it.

662
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,280
No! No!

663
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,840
I don't have such intentions.

664
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,040
It's just that Big Madam Qin...

665
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,640
she forced me to do so!

666
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,160
I don't want to,

667
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,400
but I'm afraid.

668
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,160
I'm afraid...

669
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,080
Afraid of what?

670
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,840
I'm afraid that she'll kick me out.

671
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,640
What do you want me to do then?

672
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,280
I want to leave this place.

673
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,560
I want to take my mother,

674
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,960
Nanny Lai,

675
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,520
and little sister Ruyue

676
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,800
to leave the capital together,

677
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,875
and just go back to our home province

678
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:27,560
Qizhou to live.

679
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,800
I beg Big Madam

680
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,640
to give me my slave contract.

681
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,960
You have really thought about it very clearly.

682
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,720
If there's a survival path,

683
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,880
who would dare charge into the gates of death?

684
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,520
I beg Big Madam to be merciful.

685
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,080
You people are so broad-minded.

686
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,680
How do you know

687
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,320
that I will give your slave contract back for you?

688
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:58,642
Big Madam,

689
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,400
the three of us

690
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,720
were old servants of the adjacent house.

691
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,000
If the three of us leave,

692
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,880
the remaining ones will

693
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,120
just be a loose pile of sand.

694
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,800
Whether Big Madam kicks them out

695
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,440
makes them stay,

696
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,840
they will never be able to

697
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,880
create any trouble anymore.

698
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,400
This is good

699
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,400
for our family,

700
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,160
and also good for your family.

701
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,200
If you're so clever from the start,

702
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:21,900
how could there still be

703
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,720
so much problems afterwards?

704
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,760
Sometimes, if you don't try it first,

705
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,680
you will never know which gate to survival

706
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,280
and which will lead you to death.

707
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,120
Big Madam.

708
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,200
The three of us in my family,

709
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,680
our lives are

710
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,760
in someone else's hands.

711
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,480
I was forced to do it.

712
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,480
I'm begging Big Madam to be kind.

713
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,040
Enough. You all can leave.

714
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,560
Thank you, Big Madam.

715
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,440
This meat is delicious too

716
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,200
come on

717
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,480
Try this.

718
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,800
Now that the three of them have left,

719
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,840
it is clean and peaceful now.

720
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,240
I finally have time to

721
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,600
supervise the house and the farmsteads.

722
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,550
And the farmstead that was granted

723
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,120
to you by the emperor.

724
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,400
After dealing with

725
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,360
several crafty old maids

726
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,720
and expelling out two beautiful ones,

727
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,720
in this round, you obtained a resounding victory.

728
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,680
Just do the supervision

729
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,520
whenever you

730
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,080
want to.

731
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,400
If you didn't support me

732
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,520
from the back,

733
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,880
I wouldn't have been able to

734
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,040
have the courage to do this.

735
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,480
This merit

736
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,120
goes to you.

737
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,960
Little fox.

738
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,000
You are a little fox.

739
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,120
You are humoring me

740
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:41,920
to make me feel good

741
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,200
and let me

742
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,040
be the evil guy

743
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,880
to help you with the slave contract.

744
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,480
Then I will go instead.

745
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,640
I was kidding.

746
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,520
How could you regard it as real?

747
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,400
I will go.

748
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,680
I will go after I'm done eating.

749
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,760
No need to rush.

750
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,600
Wait for a few more days.

751
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,120
If they still

752
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,440
don't send someone here,

753
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,440
you go then.

754
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:23,520
No.

755
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,680
I'm going later.

756
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,840
I'm going now.

757
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,560
I want to see

758
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,920
my stepmother fuming

759
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,320
and can't withstand me.

760
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,840
I...

761
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,880
I can't wait for it.

762
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,480
Alright, you go then.

763
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,800
my Wife.

764
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,680
I married you

765
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,280
so that you can enjoy happiness.

766
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,880
If you think managing the household is too much,

767
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,080
you can throw it to me.

768
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,760
I want to see you happy

769
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,240
like eating the meat just now.

770
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,680
No matter what you want to do,

771
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,800
I will agree.

772
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,200
I'm a military man.

773
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,200
I can't totally guess

774
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,480
what you are thinking.

775
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,480
You must tell me.

776
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,520
Why are you saying this out of the blue?

777
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,350
I'm a man of my word.

778
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,920
I surely will fulfill my promise.

779
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,760
Do you believe me?

780
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,560
I do.

781
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,280
Really?

782
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,400
It's true.

783
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,600
Master, people from Shitou's family is here.

784
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,160
They said they had something urgent to report.

785
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,920
I bumped into them

786
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,280
when we were docked on land.

787
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,880
The more I looked at her,

788
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,600
the more I found her similar

789
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,440
to the illustration you gave me.

790
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,000
I was going to

791
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,080
settle them down there first,

792
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,125
then asked my husband to come back here

793
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:55,680
and report it to you.

794
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,640
But I didn't know how,

795
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,960
she saw through my plan.

796
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,240
When the boat docked,

797
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,440
she immediately took the child and escaped.

798
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,675
My husband immediately went down the boat

799
00:34:02,675 --> 00:34:03,200
to chase after them,

800
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,160
but he failed

801
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,480
when they turned a corner.

802
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,840
If there are any news about them next time,

803
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,400
be sure to be more careful.

804
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,120
Even if you have to hire 7 to 8 big men

805
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:15,800
to surround

806
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,040
and tie her up.

807
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,760
Yes.

808
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,400
Brother Bai, we didn't handle your

809
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,600
matter well this time.

810
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,720
Really so sorry.

811
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,520
Not really

812
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,240
This woman is too cunning.

813
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,200
She's even more cruel

814
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:32,880
than a formidable man.

815
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,400
Even I can't handle her.

816
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,000
You all were also just being cautious,

817
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,960
also afraid to hurt the child.

818
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,680
It's me who bring you trouble.

819
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,560
After removing the sand blocking my eyes,

820
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,800
these accounts are more clear too.

821
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,040
I will be able to sleep well tonight.

822
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,040
In the past, everyone thinks

823
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,360
that it's dangerous for you

824
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,840
to marry into the Gu family.

825
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,040
Looking at

826
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,960
how the Master protects you,

827
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,120
I'm relieved.

828
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,560
Old Madam is extremely relieved too.

829
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,520
No one in

830
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,600
this kingdom is reliable.

831
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,520
He is a good man

832
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,680
and takes care of me.

833
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,000
This is great

834
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,560
but it's best

835
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,560
not to place too much hopes on him.

836
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,280
Everyone has their predicaments.

837
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,560
Even if you are to put your hopes,

838
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,000
don't make it too much and too deep.

839
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,920
The more hopes you have,

840
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,200
the more disappointed you will be.

841
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,800
Once there are too much disappointments,

842
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,480
you'll develop grudges.

843
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,280
Once you bear these grudges all your life,

844
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,225
you'll develop hatred and your days

845
00:35:32,225 --> 00:35:33,120
will become unbearable to live.

846
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,950
Big Madam, you don't seem to be

847
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:36,880
referring to your husband.

848
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,080
It's more like you're talking of Master Sheng.

849
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,240
I indeed have to treat

850
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,480
my husband like he's him.

851
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,080
I have to be cautious and conscientious.

852
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,200
Now, we're just newly-wed.

853
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,400
Of course, he still find me interesting,

854
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,680
but it's not only

855
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,920
for just a few months.

856
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,240
There are still many years to come.

857
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,040
In any case, placing hopes on him,

858
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,560
he might find the burden

859
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,720
too heavy one day.

860
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,880
What's up?

861
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,680
My brothers in Canal Gang

862
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,200
found traces of Chang and his mother.

863
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,360
However, they eventually lost them.

864
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,520
It's fine.

865
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,320
Since there were traces,

866
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,320
with the broad connections of the Canal Gang,

867
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,480
they surely will be able to find them.

868
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,280
If there's news again,

869
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,000
I might leave everything here

870
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,680
and go there to check.

871
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,680
You should.

872
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,800
By then,

873
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,920
I'll pack your luggage.

874
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,880
And then go to Yuqing Monastery

875
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,600
to burn you some incense and pray to the gods.

876
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,680
ok

877
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,840
You talked about inspecting the farmstead earlier.

878
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,560
Actually, those farmsteads

879
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,960
don't really earn us a lot of money every year.

880
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,600
You don't need to put too much attention to it.

881
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,760
Don't make yourself too tired.

882
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,640
How could I not to?

883
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,240
Grandmother instructed me

884
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,600
that the assets of the family

885
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,320
must be supervised regularly,

886
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,080
to prevent those in charge from deceiving us

887
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:20,800
with their reports

888
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,240
and oppressing the people under them.

889
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,800
If someone dies because of it,

890
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,200
this is no child's play.

891
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,680
So urgent?

892
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,280
Why don't I take some time off

893
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,280
and go with you?

894
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,880
No need.

895
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,425
Just be at ease and stay in the military camp

896
00:37:35,425 --> 00:37:36,080
to train your soldiers.

897
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,800
Just leave a few capable soldiers for me.

898
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,800
It will be fine.

899
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,640
Those people in charge of the farmsteads

900
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,480
are not really killing and looting bandits.

901
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,520
They are capable enough.

902
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,040
If I leave everything behind here

903
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,240
and go look for Chang alone,

904
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,600
Will you be unhappy?

905
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,160
In the past, Nanny Chang asked me too.

906
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,360
I don't know

907
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,600
why I should be unhappy.

908
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,160
I think that,

909
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,720
in the next life,

910
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,320
I will want to be your child too.

911
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,040
Marrying you

912
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,240
is really good karma

913
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,800
that I've accumulated from saving humankind

914
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,240
in the my previous several reincarnations.

915
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,800
You already told me this.

916
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,320
I know.

917
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,320
Alright, take a bath now.

918
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,400
Don't let the water get cold.

919
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,040
Let me get you some cloths.

920
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,200
What should I do

921
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,960
to make you trust me?

922
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,440
Why are you so late?

923
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,960
Old Commander Bo is waiting for you.

924
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,720
What happened?

925
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,000
Did my army

926
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,760
fight with other people again?

927
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,400
No.

928
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,240
His Majesty made an edict yesterday

929
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,925
that he will inspect the training of the army

930
00:39:19,925 --> 00:39:20,560
the next few days.

931
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,200
The two old generals

932
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,560
went to inform all the different military camps

933
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,960
to organize and prepare.

934
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,600
Inspection?

935
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,640
With such a big thing,

936
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,000
how come there were no news from Prince Huan?

937
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,440
Who knows.

938
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,240
I wanted to take a few days off

939
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,800
to settle some personal matters

940
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,600
in my family.

941
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,800
Better not to bring that up anymore.

942
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:41,840
This is serious matter.

943
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,680
It can't be handled sloppily.

944
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,040
Can't you see that even Emperor's Uncle is here?

945
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,080
I, Ba Fu,

946
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,120
greets Big Madam.

947
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,320
Big Madam, welcome.

948
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,640
The house

949
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,480
has been prepared.

950
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,880
Manager Ba, you have worked hard.

951
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,760
It's getting dark soon

952
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,200
and I still made you wait here.

953
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,920
Big Madam is a noble person.

954
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,280
Having some time to spare

955
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,320
in coming here to visit us

956
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,680
is our good fortune.

957
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,200
We are eager to greet you.

958
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,040
Thank you, Manager Ba.

959
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,040
Everyone, you all are tired too.

960
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,240
Just go home and rest now.

961
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,560
I'll check the accounting books tomorrow.

962
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,520
This...

963
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,000
Go now. I'm tired.

964
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,240
Thank you for understanding, Big Madam.

965
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:19,840
This Heishan Farmstead

966
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,080
and the Guyan Farmstead behind

967
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,320
can't compare to the Xiaoyu Farmstead

968
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,200
I brought as my dowry.

969
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,440
This is a penal farm set up by the government.

970
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,400
We're also not familiar with the people here.

971
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,840
Sister Cuiwei, I'm a bit scared.

972
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,040
Silly girl.

973
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,560
Have you prepared all the items

974
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,480
that Big Madam

975
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,440
asked?

976
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,480
all set

977
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,560
there

978
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,520
She indeed was from a scholarly family.

979
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,800
Such bearing.

980
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,440
No matter how imposing her bearing is,

981
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,720
she's still just a young Madam.

982
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,400
What can she know?

983
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,720
Tomorrow just report everything

984
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,000
according to what we discussed.

985
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,440
It's just the newly-wed wife

986
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,240
wants to come out

987
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,320
to visit her fields and show off her might.

988
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,800
Just let her show off.

989
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,600
This will be over after some coaxing.
