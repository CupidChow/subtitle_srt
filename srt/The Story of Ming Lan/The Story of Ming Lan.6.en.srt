00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,080
Episode 6

3
00:01:03,599 --> 00:01:05,199
I haven't seen your Sixth Sister these years

4
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,519
and she's grown up.

5
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,639
If she came and walked towards me,

6
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,800
I wouldn't have recognized her.

7
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,239
You already passed the exam,

8
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,160
and even if you had planted a tree,

9
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,680
it would be over 6 meters tall now.

10
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,599
Second Uncle, you sit in my seat.

11
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,239
Alright.

12
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:20,440
Second Uncle, you use mine.

13
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,360
Brother Yuanruo,

14
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,040
Why do you call him Second Uncle?

15
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:25,959
We are relatives back up the genealogy.

16
00:01:27,559 --> 00:01:29,559
This is our Fourth Sister, Molan.

17
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:32,040
Then I will call you Second Uncle

18
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,120
As Brother Yuanruo does.

19
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:34,160
You don't mind, do you?

20
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:34,919
No.

21
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,000
Greetings, Second Uncle.

22
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,279
Greetings, Fourth Sister.

23
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,559
Second Uncle Gu, greetings.

24
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:46,080
And this is our Fifth Sister, Rulan.

25
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,400
Greetings, Fifth Sister.

26
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,559
Everyone is here.

27
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,599
Greetings to Scholar Zhuang.

28
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,559
Classmate from the Gu's Marquis Manor is here too.

29
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,720
Yes, he only arrived this morning

30
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,720
and rushed to come here.

31
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,279
Good.

32
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:03,879
A youth should be diligent in the morning.

33
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,040
It's never too late to start your path.

34
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,480
You are right, Scholar.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,960
Everyone, sit.

36
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,279
Bring me your homework

37
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:14,320
from past days.

38
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,199
Sit here.

39
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:17,880
Second Brother Gu.

40
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,119
Look at mine first, Scholar

41
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,839
My Third Brother is versed in old and new.

42
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:41,000
Of course he dares to present his

43
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,520
to the Scholar first!

44
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:45,000
Versed in old and new? I think…

45
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,559
At your age,

46
00:02:57,559 --> 00:02:59,279
you are able to write such an essay.

47
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,800
What a rarity.

48
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,919
Even some candidates for the Imperial Exams wouldn't…

49
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,479
Fifth Sister. Fifth Sister?

50
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,000
That brush you're holding,

51
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,960
it looks familiar to me.

52
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,759
It was yours before,

53
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:18,240
but Sixth Sister gifted it to me.

54
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,960
Such a nice item.

55
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,000
How could you bear to gift it away?

56
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:25,559
The brush is nice,

57
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,880
but Fifth Miss, your penmanship is even better.

58
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,839
In your hands,

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,600
even if it's just a tree stick,

60
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,160
it would still shine through the ink.

61
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,199
Fifth Sister,

62
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,759
can't you distinguish between satire and compliments?

63
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:44,919
Of course you need a good brush

64
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,039
to write well.

65
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:54,080
Brother Yuanruo,

66
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,600
I wonder how many more fine brushes like this you have?

67
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,440
Sixth Sister

68
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,839
gifted me one too.

69
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:17,519
You little chit.

70
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,920
Upon meeting, you called him Second Uncle Gu.

71
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:21,000
He's the legitimate heir

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,040
of the Marquis Manor.

73
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:23,399
You added so much age to his address

74
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,359
and it's unsuitable.

75
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:27,079
Mother, what's unsuitable?

76
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:30,000
If I follow my brother's address,

77
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,440
I need to call him Second Brother Gu.

78
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,720
But then Brother Yuanruo

79
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,440
would be a nephew a generation lower than I am.

80
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,799
And that would be unsuitable.

81
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,600
Be that as it may,

82
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,440
he's still the legitimate son of the Marquis Manor.

83
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,200
And you'll all be classmates,

84
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:45,799
seeing each other daily…

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,959
Mother!

86
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,600
Don't speak nonsense.

87
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,279
How unfavorable is it for others to hear?

88
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:55,600
This Gu Tingye,

89
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,959
though he's not been at Dongjing

90
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,920
these last three to five years,

91
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,160
he went to White Deer Academy.

92
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:01,720
However, I often hear my brother mention him.

93
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,839
He's a

94
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,920
frequent customer of the entertainment inns

95
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:08,559
and a pampered young master of the brothels.

96
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:10,239
If I catch his fancy,

97
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:13,040
My life is done for forever.

98
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,279
You said

99
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,640
as if the Young Lord

100
00:05:16,679 --> 00:05:18,160
already vowed to marry you!

101
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,279
The Young Lord

102
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,880
often comes to see me write lately.

103
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,920
And he compliments me that my writing is nice.

104
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,760
Was he looking at you,

105
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,359
or the brush you're holding?

106
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,959
He's looking at the brush from his hand,

107
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,880
coming to my hand

108
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,279
and writing out so nicely.

109
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,679
Wouldn't he be enticed?

110
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,119
My daughter

111
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:46,959
is the best Miss of Sheng manor.

112
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:49,079
If that Young Lord is smitten by you,

113
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:50,440
that's nothing peculiar.

114
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,799
I just don't know

115
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:54,440
what your father is thinking though.

116
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,200
Why did he let that

117
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,000
loafer Gu come to study?

118
00:05:57,359 --> 00:05:59,320
All the maidens of the family are there.

119
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:02,239
What if he takes a interest in you too?

120
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,799
What do we do then?

121
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,799
Mother, you don't worry.

122
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,640
That Gu Tingye is quite haughty.

123
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,640
He's already said before,

124
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,279
that he will only marry the legitimate daughter

125
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,000
of an aristocrat.

126
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,320
Regrettably all the aristocratic households

127
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,959
of the capital dislike his loafing badly.

128
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,600
No one wants to marry

129
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,519
their legitimate daughter to him,

130
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,320
or else at an age past twenty

131
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,519
why is he still unmarried?

132
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:28,320
Duke and Marquis households

133
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,279
wanting to marry with legitimate daughters

134
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:29,880
as wives is common.

135
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,000
Gu Tingye wants a legitimate daughter,

136
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,239
so does this Young Lord of yours,

137
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,880
wouldn't he want a legitimate daughter too?

138
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:36,519
Brother Yuanruo

139
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,760
is a true gentleman.

140
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,040
He wouldn't commit

141
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,160
such an arrogant act.

142
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,239
Yunzai that works for me

143
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,679
has had drinks with his manservant a few times.

144
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,799
She only heard from him after getting him drunk,

145
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,720
that Brother Yuanruo

146
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,640
never cares about legitimate or not,

147
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:54,920
as long as the person is nice.

148
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,679
He said

149
00:06:57,679 --> 00:07:00,440
that a man should earn his own honour and official rank.

150
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,399
Win a noble position for one's wife and leave it to his posterity

151
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,239
is what a truly great man does.

152
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:23,440
May I ask

153
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,000
if it's Young Lord who is in there?

154
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,399
Miss Xiaotao?

155
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:33,679
What brought you here?

156
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:36,040
Young Lord, you left your book in the study hall,

157
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,279
so I brought it to you.

158
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:39,200
Please wait.

159
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,640
My miss said,

160
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,880
Young Lord meant well.

161
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,079
It's regrettable that her writing

162
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,720
is so beyond help

163
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,720
that such nice brushes

164
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,040
may go to waste with her.

165
00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:53,519
She is so sorry

166
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:55,040
For your kindness.

167
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:57,119
This is snack made at home

168
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:58,320
for you to try,

169
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:00,040
as a token of my Miss' regret.

170
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,399
How could it be a waste used by her?

171
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,399
It's because the writing isn't good

172
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:06,679
that it requires a good brush.

173
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:09,359
Or else,

174
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:10,880
may I bring her some floral papers?

175
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,119
My Miss said

176
00:08:12,119 --> 00:08:14,279
Young Lord is the most merciful.

177
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:15,880
Only if word gets out

178
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,880
to the gossipers,

179
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,600
it might harm your reputation.

180
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,880
I'm a grown man.

181
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,320
Who cares about reputation?

182
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,279
She took my stuff

183
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,320
and threw them to others,

184
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,679
and then tried to fob me off like this.

185
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,919
Miss said

186
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,479
you needn't bring anything for her in the future either.

187
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,479
She's accomplished no merit

188
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,799
to deserve it,

189
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,960
and it would only make her feel guilty.

190
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:43,159
She would feel really uneasy.

191
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,799
Young Lord, your Imperial exam is the most urgent matter.

192
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:45,960
May you take care.

193
00:09:07,479 --> 00:09:08,559
The clerk left some fresh jasper cakes

194
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,640
for us especially.

195
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,119
We'll bring them to your mother

196
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:12,200
and she'll surely be pleased.

197
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,159
Young Master, where did this come from?

198
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,080
I keep thinking

199
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,479
I am being nice to her,

200
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:35,280
but she may not even care after all.

201
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:39,840
Do you mean Sixth Miss Sheng?

202
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,719
I am used to having my way in life.

203
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,479
I deemed myself so precious.

204
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:55,280
But she didn't even care

205
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,440
to talk to me much.

206
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,760
Gifts I presented her?

207
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,479
She just threw them to others in a blink.

208
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,919
I kept thinking…

209
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,799
that she felt shy.

210
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,320
In fact she is actually

211
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,200
afraid of me and tired of me.

212
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,200
Hiding from me.

213
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,239
Disregarding me.

214
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:24,640
So it must be

215
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,400
because of Sixth Miss Sheng.

216
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,760
She's concubine-born,

217
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,799
so why would she look down upon you?

218
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,280
Young Master,

219
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,679
you are the sole heir of Duke Qi.

220
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:34,760
So if I'm a young lord,

221
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,919
she must respect me?

222
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,400
So what if she's concubine-born?

223
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,919
She's not allowed to disregard me then?

224
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,359
I was just been self-sentimental.

225
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:45,719
Laughable.

226
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:49,679
How laughable.

227
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,039
Young Lord, you've not had wine

228
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,359
but why do you look like drunk?

229
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,200
I'm a bit scared.

230
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,080
Sixth Miss came by earlier?

231
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,239
Is this from her?

232
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,119
What on earth did she say?

233
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,679
Wine?

234
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:18,159
Great.

235
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,400
That's a great idea.

236
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,840
Turn around.

237
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,239
Let's go and drink wine at Fanlou.

238
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,280
Turn around.

239
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:31,880
Young Lord, that's not a good idea.

240
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,280
Her Highness is still

241
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,159
waiting for you at home.

242
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:37,119
Driver Wang, we're not turning around.

243
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,880
Turn around!

244
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,119
Don't turn around!

245
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,280
Buwei,

246
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,840
you want to annoy me, too?

247
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:52,479
Turn around!

248
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:02,599
I already told everything you told me

249
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:03,919
to say to Young Lord.

250
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,280
Miss, you're so smart.

251
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,280
How did you know

252
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,280
how the Young Lord would respond?

253
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,039
It was exactly as you said it would be.

254
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:13,159
How did he look?

255
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:16,159
At first, he was pretty anxious.

256
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:19,320
Then he got angry.

257
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,239
Then he wasn't angry again.

258
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:25,960
It seemed he didn't want to talk to me anymore.

259
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,719
Being angry is also fine,

260
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:34,880
and not wanting to talk is fine too.

261
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:37,599
It's all fine. All fine.

262
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:42,039
My mother just worries too much.

263
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,039
Was she afraid Sheng Manor had no food

264
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:44,119
that she insisted I come back to get it?

265
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,159
It's delaying me

266
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,239
and making me late.

267
00:12:46,479 --> 00:12:47,119
These jade cakes were made personally

268
00:12:47,119 --> 00:12:48,200
by Madam.

269
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,159
She said you caused trouble to the Sheng's

270
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:51,200
for studying there.

271
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,679
So she wanted you to bring them to the Sheng's to try.

272
00:12:54,719 --> 00:12:55,520
Young Master.

273
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:56,960
Nanny Xiang.

274
00:12:57,599 --> 00:12:59,200
Did you get the jade cakes?

275
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:01,359
Madam saved them for you especially.

276
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,159
You're in such a flurry.

277
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:04,799
Where are you going?

278
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,760
Nothing.

279
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,559
Aren't you headed to Sheng Manor to study?

280
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,640
Don't let your studies be delayed.

281
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:14,520
What is it exactly?

282
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:19,080
It's just some unimportant matters in backyard.

283
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:20,919
The cooks in kitchen were not careful

284
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:22,239
and burned a corner.

285
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,679
I was just scolding them.

286
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,320
Nanny Xiang

287
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,520
isn't serving Mother

288
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,719
and comes here,

289
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:29,679
and tells me there is nothing wrong.

290
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:33,799
You, come here.

291
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,960
Tell me. What is it?

292
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,440
Nanny Xiang is having us go…

293
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,359
go chase someone out!

294
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:46,080
Chase out whom?

295
00:13:46,119 --> 00:13:47,960
Second Young Master.

296
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,520
Someone from “Thousand Springs Pavilion” is here.

297
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:01,159
Ask everyone in the city of Bianjing,

298
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:03,359
does any mother behave like you?

299
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:04,559
No matter what chaos

300
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:06,039
these bastard created,

301
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,479
you just shield him!

302
00:14:08,479 --> 00:14:10,159
And you help them to deceive me too.

303
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,640
If it hadn't been me personally running into this,

304
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:12,320
how much more personal money

305
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,479
would you pour

306
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:15,520
into helping these bastards?

307
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,960
It's just small amounts.

308
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,599
Furthermore,

309
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:22,719
this Thousand Springs Pavilion,

310
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,679
who knows if they're telling the truth anyway.

311
00:14:24,719 --> 00:14:26,359
They are here to seek the money owed

312
00:14:26,359 --> 00:14:28,359
and it's not real?

313
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,200
Second Young Master, you're here in perfect time.

314
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,840
Please settle the account

315
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,200
so I can go back.

316
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,799
How long has it been since I last went to

317
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:53,000
the Thousand Springs Pavilion?

318
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,960
How can there be an account unsettled?

319
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,080
It's written here.

320
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,520
Second Son of Marquis of Ningyuan.

321
00:14:58,599 --> 00:14:59,039
Look,

322
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:01,559
your seal is here too.

323
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,039
Shituo.

324
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:02,760
Yes?

325
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,320
Bring a brush.

326
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:10,640
Young Master.

327
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:19,039
Look. Does it look like mine?

328
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:21,239
It doesn't.

329
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:24,280
You see it now.

330
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,599
I said it might not be his.

331
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,119
But Young Master,

332
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:31,000
you signed this when you were drunk,

333
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,559
so it's less clear than this.

334
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:34,960
You're a noble family.Please don't torment me.

335
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,200
If I don't get the silver today,

336
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,559
my boss will break my legs.

337
00:15:38,599 --> 00:15:40,479
Now listen to him.

338
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:43,200
Does what he said makes sense or not?

339
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,679
Two days ago, I drank at Ten Thousand Aromas Pavilion

340
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:48,239
it was Second Brother who settled the bill.

341
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,440
He can afford Ten Thousand Aromas Pavilion.

342
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,799
So he didn't need to owe

343
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:53,200
the Thousand Springs Pavilion, right?

344
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,000
Maybe

345
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,880
Thousand Springs Pavilion is blackmailing us.

346
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:58,200
In other families, the brothers love and respect each other.

347
00:15:58,239 --> 00:16:00,679
But your Second Brother is a disgrace!

348
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:04,000
Are you still trying to

349
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,760
play accomplice with him?

350
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,799
What an example has he set,

351
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,080
and what have you learned?

352
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:11,479
Get lost!

353
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:11,919
It's just

354
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:13,200
a matter of a hundred taels.

355
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:14,679
It's not that Second Brother can't afford it.

356
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:15,960
Speak louder.

357
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,320
Is this about money?

358
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,200
A person should have good honor!

359
00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:21,799
That disgrace

360
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:23,760
claims to go out to study,

361
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,760
coaxing your mother to protect him with full devotion.

362
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:29,479
Then this happens today!

363
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:33,239
Father.

364
00:16:33,239 --> 00:16:34,760
Whatever you want to say, say it to me.

365
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,719
Don't frighten him.

366
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:39,440
Also, Tingwei is right.

367
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:41,280
It's just a matter of a hundred taels.

368
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,799
Did I have to put it on account?

369
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,760
Money?

370
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,039
You only know about money?

371
00:16:47,599 --> 00:16:50,200
Because of your maternal family

372
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,719
gave you all the silver

373
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,440
and you squander it like this?

374
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,640
A toxin to the family. Hopeless!

375
00:16:58,119 --> 00:16:59,200
Don't say that.

376
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,479
Tingye,

377
00:17:03,479 --> 00:17:05,400
it's only just a few taels in silver.

378
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,560
Just give it to them.

379
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,520
Isn't it only one hundred twenty taels in silver?

380
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,000
Wait.

381
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,280
I will get it for you.

382
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,359
I will get it.

383
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,560
Stop right there!

384
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,880
Do you know where the silver is kept?

385
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,880
This Nanny Xiang is no good,either.

386
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,079
Why isn't she here?

387
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,439
Father, you said I squandered

388
00:17:31,439 --> 00:17:33,239
my mother's family's money.

389
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,040
We don't know who did that yet.

390
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,520
There is just that round red stamp on top

391
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,920
and you said it's mine.

392
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,680
Those from the Fourth and Fifth Houses

393
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,079
keep bilking their debts on my account.

394
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:48,119
They go out to drink at brothels and look for prostitutes

395
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:50,479
then register the debts under my name.

396
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,719
Come here and take a look!

397
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,160
Is this the face that owes you money?

398
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:57,800
Young Master, the brothel wants me

399
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,079
to come here to collect the debt.

400
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,479
Young Master, please don't implicate me.

401
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,439
Fine. Let your boss come

402
00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:06,400
here to recognize the face

403
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,760
and see who's the one really owes you the money!

404
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,479
Enough.

405
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:11,800
Do you want a face recognition?

406
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:13,359
You don't care about being embarrassed yet,

407
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,040
but the Gu family does!

408
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,040
Fine.

409
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,479
Blame me for the loss of the Gu family's face then.

410
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:22,719
In the past,

411
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:24,000
when I spent thousands of taels of silver in the brothel,

412
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,400
you blamed me and I couldn't argue,

413
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,800
but I have now turned over a new leaf

414
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,839
and live a decent life.

415
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:31,839
If there are any problems,

416
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:33,239
you still suspect me first!

417
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,119
Then if only I die

418
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,920
can the Gu family get to keep its honor?

419
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:38,680
Your older brother is sick and weak.

420
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,319
He doesn't leave the house.

421
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,640
Third Son was just here

422
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,800
and they didn't point him out.

423
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,920
Don't tell me there are immortals

424
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,000
and ancestors in this house

425
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,880
who signed your name to promissory notes?

426
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,839
I have already given you face.

427
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,640
You only know how to be shameless

428
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,000
and still refuse to admit it?

429
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:56,359
Does the Gu family

430
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:58,839
only have those two men?

431
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,520
There are uncles in the Fourth and Fifth Houses,

432
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,280
and also the brothers from other branches.

433
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,079
Plus cousins, there are some eight or nine people.

434
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:04,599
There's also you too,

435
00:19:04,719 --> 00:19:06,920
Father.

436
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,319
Say that again.

437
00:19:13,199 --> 00:19:15,000
Say that again!

438
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,359
In any case,

439
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,560
whatever I say, you won't believe me.

440
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:23,880
You already believe it's me.

441
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:27,359
Just beat me then.

442
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:29,359
Beat me now.

443
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:30,640
After this,

444
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,839
I still need to go to the Sheng's

445
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:33,000
for Scholar Zhuang's class.

446
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,479
After the classes that you studied in,

447
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,719
is this how they taught you

448
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:38,640
to oppose and disrespect your father?

449
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,400
You can falsely accuse me,

450
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,280
please don't do this to the Academy Scholar.

451
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:45,239
Fine then.

452
00:19:45,239 --> 00:19:46,839
Men.

453
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:51,520
Beat him.

454
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,280
Beat this unfilial son!

455
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,160
Countess.

456
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,319
Madam.

457
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,800
You are a rare guest.

458
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:29,719
Quick, go into the house to warm up.

459
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,880
I was at

460
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,680
the polo field just now

461
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,680
and passed your garden

462
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,280
and saw how pretty it was.

463
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:38,839
I suddenly dropped in and

464
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:40,000
It's rather impolite.

465
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:41,839
You are an important guest.

466
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,560
I always wished for your visiting!

467
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,800
Madam thought your class might be done now

468
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,000
and asks you to go to her.

469
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,640
Sixth!

470
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,520
Make grilled lamb meat for me!

471
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:14,479
Mother. Mother!

472
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,599
My dearest, you're finally here.

473
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,880
Madam went to host the guests in the front hall

474
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,839
and instructed me to look after you.

475
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,479
I'm to make sure you're dressed and accessorized,

476
00:21:22,479 --> 00:21:24,160
refined and proper.

477
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:24,760
Quick.

478
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:26,959
What are you doing?

479
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:28,400
Big Madam Wu is here!

480
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,040
We don't have any dealings with her.

481
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,839
Why is she here?

482
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,199
To play polo?

483
00:21:34,199 --> 00:21:36,479
It's too exhausting!

484
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,319
What do you mean, polo! My dear Miss.

485
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:39,880
She suddenly came to our home

486
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,479
and also brought

487
00:21:40,479 --> 00:21:41,880
her youngest son, that Sixth Master.

488
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:44,079
Liang Han is his name.

489
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:45,319
Madam told me,

490
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,560
she must be here to have a look for someone,

491
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:51,160
and marry you off as their daughter-in-law.

492
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,199
What's the big deal?

493
00:21:53,239 --> 00:21:55,040
That I must change to a new hairdo and clothes?

494
00:21:55,199 --> 00:21:55,920
I'm not doing it!

495
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,000
Mother!

496
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,959
Mother.

497
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:21,800
The Weiruixuan people came

498
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,880
and summoned Fifth Sister earlier.

499
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,359
I was waiting for you to come back.

500
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,640
Big Madam Wu is here.

501
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,560
Big Madam Wu of the Count of Yongchang Manor?

502
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,760
That's her.

503
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,400
She is a

504
00:22:31,439 --> 00:22:33,439
very enthusiastic person.

505
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,839
Everyone in Bianliang praises her.

506
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,719
Many families seek her to look for a match

507
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:39,560
for their children.

508
00:22:40,479 --> 00:22:42,199
She suddenly dropped in today,

509
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:43,439
and Big Madam immediately

510
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:44,439
called Rulan back.

511
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,560
Guess what it is for?

512
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,439
It must be that

513
00:22:48,439 --> 00:22:49,719
she heard the daughters in the Sheng family

514
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:51,280
have all come of age,

515
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,079
and came here specially to observe.

516
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,199
Once, my dear, you have dressed up

517
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:56,119
and become the most beautiful,

518
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,199
it'll have nothing to do

519
00:22:57,199 --> 00:22:58,160
with Weiruixuan anymore!

520
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,199
Who wants her to observe me?

521
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:01,760
Brother Yuanruo

522
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,199
has already seen me many times.

523
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,680
Mo'er, he's not the only Young Lord in this world!

524
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,119
It's good to meet more people.

525
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,520
For example ones from Duke Lingguo

526
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,439
or from Marquis Jinxiang's family…

527
00:23:12,479 --> 00:23:13,920
Mother, do not mention

528
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,239
the house of Duke Lingguo.

529
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:17,000
His house is deplorable.

530
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,040
I heard from Eldest Brother that

531
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,599
the sons in their family

532
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,520
are the same age as Second Brother,

533
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,439
but they have about twenty wives and servant maids

534
00:23:24,479 --> 00:23:25,280
serving them.

535
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,280
That kind of family,

536
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,199
don't even mention me,

537
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,359
not even my maid Yunzai

538
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:31,280
would look favorably upon them.

539
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,520
Mo'er, there is nothing certain

540
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,439
in this world.

541
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,560
Unless this Young Lord

542
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:39,839
sends his betrothal gifts today

543
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:40,839
to formalize the marriage,

544
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,119
it's better to have a look

545
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:44,680
around some more.

546
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,319
Then we go take a look.

547
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:53,000
We should let Bianjing know

548
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,199
there is such a person as I am.

549
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:55,959
Come.

550
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,560
I wonder

551
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,160
how your mother health is.

552
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:04,400
Thank you, Big Madam, for your concern.

553
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,719
It must be a blessing from

554
00:24:06,719 --> 00:24:07,680
His Majesty in Bianliang,

555
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,560
my Mother is in much a better health

556
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,439
than back in Yangzhou.

557
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:13,800
That's good then.

558
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:15,839
Elders in good health

559
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:17,079
is a great fortune for the whole family.

560
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,040
Madam,

561
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,319
you have great fortune.

562
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:22,959
Prior to

563
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:24,640
my marriage,

564
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,959
I have met Old Madam before.

565
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,800
The only daughter of the Marquis of Yongyi,

566
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:32,000
Such style and poise!

567
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,079
I only hope

568
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:37,160
to be able to meet with her again.

569
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,760
When the flowers have only just bloomed

570
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,040
why are you holding a fan?

571
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,079
You'll look inexperienced and ignorant.

572
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,359
Mother, no one is calling us yet.

573
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,040
Could it be that she's not calling us?

574
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,400
No such rule.

575
00:25:10,239 --> 00:25:11,359
She's the Madam,

576
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:13,119
then she should have the demeanor of one.

577
00:25:13,239 --> 00:25:14,760
Any female guests

578
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,079
would just have this request

579
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:17,319
to have a look at the children.

580
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,719
If the guest asks for it, and she doesn't call us

581
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:21,319
then she's deliberately cheating us.

582
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:23,160
It cannot be justified no matter where she goes.

583
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:26,359
You are right, Mother.

584
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,920
Nanny Liu!

585
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,839
Fifth Miss.

586
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,599
Time to go?

587
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:08,839
Wait a while longer.

588
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,640
Then let's have the meal.

589
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,479
Wait a while longer.

590
00:26:21,719 --> 00:26:23,160
I'm starving.

591
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,359
Brew the “Seven Treasures Thunder” tea

592
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:25,239
for me to drink.

593
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,119
Miss, why not have some cakes first?

594
00:26:29,199 --> 00:26:30,119
The kitchen has some

595
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:31,800
new quality pastries today.

596
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,680
You are talking too much!

597
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:35,160
Go now!

598
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,239
Are you here to call for me?

599
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:58,599
Come! Bring my cloak now.

600
00:27:01,239 --> 00:27:03,199
I asked the maid servants in the front hall.

601
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,839
After the Countess left Big Madam's court,

602
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:06,839
she went to the front sitting room.

603
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,239
I took a look,

604
00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:10,520
and saw her son talking to our Second Master.

605
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,719
I fear the mother and son

606
00:27:11,719 --> 00:27:13,280
are leaving soon.

607
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,959
What?

608
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:17,199
Looks like Big Madam

609
00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:19,400
will not summon you to see the Countess.

610
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:26,959
Miss…this…

611
00:27:31,719 --> 00:27:34,359
No propriety at all!

612
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,319
You are of marriageable age,

613
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:38,560
but it's Big Madam who is responsible for such matters.

614
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,599
She has been jealous and hating us for many years!

615
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:41,400
I wonder how much suffering

616
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,680
you will receive in the future!

617
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,199
You start breaking things now.

618
00:27:44,199 --> 00:27:45,760
I wonder if there would be enough things in this house

619
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,119
for you to squander in the future?

620
00:27:47,439 --> 00:27:48,880
Now what? Should we just not go

621
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,040
because she didn't call us?

622
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:50,760
You!

623
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,079
I have an idea

624
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:53,199
though it may not help much,

625
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,160
but at least we've tried.

626
00:27:55,239 --> 00:27:56,160
Fourth Miss,

627
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,400
you should go and take a look.

628
00:27:57,439 --> 00:27:58,680
Even if you can't meet him,

629
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,160
you can at least have a look through the seams.

630
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,199
If you know

631
00:28:02,239 --> 00:28:03,359
what the Countess looks like,

632
00:28:03,439 --> 00:28:04,800
then if there are any banquets

633
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,479
or polo games, poem gatherings, flower viewings in the future,

634
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,119
then you will know who she is.

635
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,479
If you need to try to gain her favor,

636
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,439
then you'll at least have some information.

637
00:28:11,479 --> 00:28:12,640
It's just that our Fourth Miss

638
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,079
will have to suffer some grievances.

639
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,079
As the Fourth Miss,

640
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:21,319
now do I have to go via the back hall,

641
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:22,959
and peek from behind the screen?

642
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:26,119
This is such a disgrace.

643
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,760
Miss, this is not the right way to look at it.

644
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,199
What's so disgraceful about that?

645
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:30,680
If you don't act when you need to

646
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,719
then even your innards

647
00:28:31,719 --> 00:28:33,920
will turn green from regret!

648
00:28:37,199 --> 00:28:38,599
You should be glad that I asked you

649
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:40,040
to make embroideries for me.

650
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,839
In any case, if you don't finish

651
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:43,239
the knee pad in time that I want to give to Eldest Sister,

652
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,920
I won't let you off.

653
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,439
It's what Madam wanted you to embroider

654
00:28:47,439 --> 00:28:49,040
yet you pushed it to me.

655
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,560
I really can't do it.

656
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:52,400
Why don't we go

657
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,959
and discuss this with Madam then?

658
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,319
Of course we can't

659
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,040
discuss this with my mother!

660
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:58,640
What's wrong with you?

661
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,040
I told you to help me with some embroidery,

662
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,079
but you're making so many excuses.

663
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:03,119
I don't care.

664
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,880
You must embroider this knee pad.

665
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,199
If you fail to do it…

666
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,359
If you fail to do it…

667
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,760
At meal time, I'll personally make

668
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,560
barbecued lamb and charcoal-grilled meat.

669
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,239
Really?

670
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,520
Stop interrupting!

671
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,599
I want to eat that

672
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:20,640
but also…

673
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:22,359
I want that knee pad too!

674
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:24,280
Moreover, do it fast.

675
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:27,479
Y-You want me to copy books,

676
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,000
and want me to cook lunch too.

677
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,599
And you want to me make knee pads.

678
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,920
I-I can't do it all.

679
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:37,479
I'll just let you

680
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:39,359
go to see the Madam and reports.

681
00:29:39,439 --> 00:29:40,959
I won't do them all.

682
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,839
Why don't we go

683
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:45,040
and eat the lamb first?

684
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:46,439
My stomach's already growling,

685
00:29:46,439 --> 00:29:47,199
I'm starving.

686
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,880
Cook it fast.

687
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:50,199
You should make me an extra knee pad

688
00:29:50,199 --> 00:29:52,680
for every quarter-hour of delay!

689
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,160
Let's go!

690
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,839
Miss.

691
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,119
Miss, be careful.

692
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,000
It's such a big step!

693
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,079
Why didn't you watch out for me?

694
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,359
You let everyone see this.

695
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:10,439
Come with me.

696
00:30:10,439 --> 00:30:11,199
Miss, be careful.

697
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:24,479
Why is she behaving furtively?

698
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:26,319
Let's follow her.

699
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,040
Let's go.

700
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,359
Don't go.

701
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,800
I… I need to go back and make barbecued lamb.

702
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:36,359
She's behaving furtively.

703
00:30:36,439 --> 00:30:37,520
She must be up to some tricks.

704
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,640
Let's go and take a look.

705
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,439
We should…

706
00:30:39,439 --> 00:30:40,680
go back and eat the lamb!

707
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,640
I'm not eating that anymore!

708
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,400
You…

709
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:44,359
Let me tell you.

710
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:44,839
If you go with me,

711
00:30:45,239 --> 00:30:45,800
you don't have to

712
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,760
make those knee pads for me!

713
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,640
Let's go now.

714
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,239
I must catch her on something!

715
00:30:49,239 --> 00:30:49,800
Hurry up.

716
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,680
Hurry up.

717
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:18,040
Fifth Sister, who do you see that is out there?

718
00:31:27,199 --> 00:31:29,000
I haven't finished copying the Songs of Chu

719
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,880
that Scholar Zhuang assigned me.

720
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,640
I'm leaving first.

721
00:31:30,719 --> 00:31:31,520
Come back.

722
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,719
Sixth Sister, who you think

723
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:46,359
Is better between the Young Lord

724
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:47,839
and the Sixth Son of the Wus House?

725
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,760
Whoever Scholar Zhuang thinks is better,

726
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,719
then he is better.

727
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,319
Classes start at the second quarter of six in the morning.

728
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,839
We study a new text every five days.

729
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:03,880
Starting at six in the morning!

730
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,839
Young Lord,

731
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:09,000
how do you manage to get up?

732
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,959
The Sheng family has a younger daughter. She also…

733
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:16,520
Who?

734
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,040
Frankly, it's difficult for me

735
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,199
to get up at this time.

736
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,400
Brother Qi, Brother Qi,

737
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,680
why do you bother this?

738
00:32:28,719 --> 00:32:30,760
We are from aristocratic families.

739
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,280
You are talented and ambitious

740
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:33,520
and set on taking the examinations.

741
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,640
As for me, I'll just wait to inherit my title.

742
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:39,319
They all say that the Sixth Son of Liangs

743
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:41,280
is very respectable and noble,

744
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:44,439
but words are pale against meeting the actual person.

745
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,800
In my opinion

746
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,920
he's like that Second Uncle Gu,

747
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,479
just an idle wastrel.

748
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,439
In view of

749
00:32:51,439 --> 00:32:52,719
the noble young masters in Bianliang,

750
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,319
and in terms of talents and looks,

751
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,160
Fifth Sister,

752
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,599
which do you think is better?

753
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,359
Fourth Sister, the way you talk about this,

754
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,119
It sounds like you are a princess or

755
00:33:07,199 --> 00:33:09,719
a concubine in the palace

756
00:33:09,719 --> 00:33:11,839
and all the noble Young Masters in Bianliang

757
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:13,160
are there for your picking.

758
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:15,280
It's a pity that

759
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,800
no matter how high your ambition is,

760
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,439
you'll never be in the same class

761
00:33:18,479 --> 00:33:19,719
as the Duke Qi.

762
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:26,079
It's not proper for young ladies

763
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:27,160
to peek into the front halls.

764
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:29,079
We should go back.

765
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:30,680
That's right.

766
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,239
Little Sister is the respectable child of main wife

767
00:33:32,239 --> 00:33:33,599
and naturally should be the most well-behaved.

768
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,439
But what's the use of being well-behaved?

769
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:36,680
You can't even have a chat

770
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,000
with Brother Yuanruo!

771
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,920
What a waste of Madam's efforts

772
00:33:39,959 --> 00:33:41,599
in sending you to school.

773
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:44,319
Forget about composing poems or literary works.

774
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,839
I'm afraid you can't even differentiate

775
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:47,599
between Confucius and Mencius.

776
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,839
If people didn't know better,

777
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:50,239
they'd think she's the daughter of the concubine.

778
00:33:50,239 --> 00:33:51,959
What are you talking about?

779
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,680
Fifth Sister, Sixth Sister,

780
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,839
what are you doing?

781
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,639
What's wrong? What happened?

782
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,959
I… I was going to leave.

783
00:34:22,439 --> 00:34:24,080
Where are your manners?

784
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,520
I heard she was the legitimate daughter.

785
00:34:52,959 --> 00:34:54,439
I've never seen any daughter of any other house

786
00:34:54,439 --> 00:34:55,560
show her face like that!

787
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,120
Minister Sheng is a true gentleman.

788
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:01,320
Old Madam of Sheng House

789
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,679
is the precious daughter of a marquis.

790
00:35:02,879 --> 00:35:05,360
Their family has always kept up with rigorous manners.

791
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,760
I never ever imagined that.

792
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,280
Don't play so innocent now.

793
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,719
Those maidens.

794
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:13,159
If it hadn't been because they knew you were coming,

795
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:14,760
and they wanted to steal a look,

796
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,959
this wouldn't have happened.

797
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,600
The daughters of Sheng House were just too anxious

798
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:22,879
and made an ignorant blunder.

799
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,000
The one on the side

800
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,239
seemed quite gentle and refined.

801
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,600
She seemed to have been dragged there

802
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,159
forcibly by the two on the ground.

803
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:31,639
From her manners of speaking,

804
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:34,000
she seems to be a concubine-born.

805
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,159
That's not an issue!

806
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:37,280
Treating concubine's daughters harshly

807
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,320
is the conduct of unrefined lowly households!

808
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:42,919
Once a woman marries out,

809
00:35:42,919 --> 00:35:44,760
it's a new world.

810
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,159
As long as they are not married yet,

811
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:48,520
no one knows what the future holds.

812
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,959
Young Master, only you can smile about it.

813
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:09,800
I don't know why,

814
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,120
but I was angry at her

815
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,120
for many days.

816
00:36:15,399 --> 00:36:17,159
Yet as soon as I saw her,

817
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,560
I found it amusing again.

818
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,760
She's always lost and dazed,

819
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,239
or dodging and evading.

820
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,000
She's not inclined for others to see her.

821
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,479
When have you ever seen her like today?

822
00:36:27,879 --> 00:36:29,520
Indeed quite pitiful and cute.

823
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,639
I won't forget it in ten years.

824
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,239
Quieter, Young Master.

825
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:35,879
Don't let the driver outside hear you.

826
00:36:35,919 --> 00:36:36,879
Why?

827
00:36:36,879 --> 00:36:38,399
When the Sheng maidens

828
00:36:38,399 --> 00:36:39,399
fell down today,

829
00:36:39,439 --> 00:36:40,719
you wanted to help her up.

830
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:41,879
It's not proper.

831
00:36:41,879 --> 00:36:43,080
What's not proper about it?

832
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,399
I've been hiding it for you all this time,

833
00:36:46,399 --> 00:36:47,879
but thankfully Sixth Miss understands propriety.

834
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,679
Even though you insist on getting close to her,

835
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,439
she's not spoiled or arrogant,

836
00:36:51,439 --> 00:36:52,520
or else it would be hard to hide it.

837
00:36:56,399 --> 00:36:58,199
What's there to hide?

838
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:00,000
Your mother won't like your conduct.

839
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,800
And today we had Countess of Yongchang

840
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,760
along too.

841
00:37:02,879 --> 00:37:03,879
She's got quite a tongue.

842
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:07,479
If word gets out that

843
00:37:07,479 --> 00:37:08,840
you helped Miss Sheng up,

844
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,840
then it would be all real.

845
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:11,479
If your mother finds out,

846
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,600
she'll definitely come to the Shengs' Manor.

847
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,679
If she shows up at the door,

848
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:16,719
the Sheng Misses would be obliged

849
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:17,639
to answer her one by one.

850
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:18,360
Who knows what

851
00:37:18,399 --> 00:37:19,439
she would ask?

852
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:21,760
Your conduct in the past

853
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,840
would all be exposed!

854
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,959
Look at how scared you are.

855
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,760
I didn't help her up today.

856
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,159
Moreover,

857
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:31,479
Mother would disdain the Sheng family's

858
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,879
social status.

859
00:37:33,879 --> 00:37:34,959
She wouldn't go there.

860
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:36,560
You never know.

861
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,560
For your sake,

862
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,199
Your mother is watching everything closely.

863
00:37:39,479 --> 00:37:41,520
And the Duke is concerned.

864
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,560
Every night he returns,

865
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,800
he asks about everything.

866
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,239
What's there to ask?

867
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:50,120
The Sixth Sheng Miss

868
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,800
is only just short of sweeping me out the door.

869
00:37:57,719 --> 00:37:58,520
What did you do wrongly?

870
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,159
I shouldn't have . . .

871
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,159
I shouldn't have, without summoning,

872
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:10,520
barged into the front hall.

873
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,879
What summoning?

874
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:16,280
Is there a place in this house

875
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,320
that the daughter can't go?

876
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:20,280
Are we still Shengs?

877
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,439
You just beat me when you want to.

878
00:38:22,959 --> 00:38:23,560
But why do you just favor me

879
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,439
and ignore the other two?

880
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,280
As to going to the front hall,

881
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,800
we all three went there.

882
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,360
Why is it only the two of us got beaten

883
00:38:29,439 --> 00:38:30,439
and not Molan?

884
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,399
What?

885
00:38:33,399 --> 00:38:34,479
Sister is right.

886
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,679
Since Eldest Sister married off,

887
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,760
I am the eldest among the daughters still at home.

888
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:42,280
But I failed to look after

889
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,719
my younger sisters well today and let

890
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,199
this disaster occur,

891
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:47,000
and I ask Father to punish me too.

892
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,919
We don't need you to speak here!

893
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,280
Yes, yes, yes.

894
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,600
Madam, don't be angry.

895
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:55,840
Mo'er, this has nothing to do with you.

896
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,520
You get up.

897
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,479
What?

898
00:39:02,959 --> 00:39:03,760
You don't feel

899
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,000
should be getting this?

900
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,679
Give me your hand.

901
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,479
Your hand!

902
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,360
Your hand again!

903
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:29,239
If I don't punish you harshly,

904
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:30,000
you just don't know

905
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,360
where you erred.

906
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:36,479
You're punishing us for barging into the front hall.

907
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,080
Breaking the family rules,

908
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,520
and you blame us for falling down

909
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,560
and startling the guests.

910
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,919
Bringing shame to Sheng's honor.

911
00:39:43,959 --> 00:39:45,239
But it was Molan who brought us

912
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,520
to the front hall!

913
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,399
And it was Molan who pushed us to get us falling down!

914
00:39:49,479 --> 00:39:50,600
We were just going to have a chat

915
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,439
behind the screen,

916
00:39:52,439 --> 00:39:53,719
just a chat, we never…

917
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,760
I saw that Fifth and Sixth Sister

918
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,040
were walking ahead,

919
00:39:57,239 --> 00:40:00,280
and I just wanted to startle them for fun.

920
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,000
Ultimately, I am the eldest sister

921
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,360
and I failed to watch over them well.

922
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,320
Father please punish me along with them.

923
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,280
You're lying! You're lying!

924
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:13,959
It was clear

925
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:15,959
that you who took us to the front hall.

926
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,679
Sixth Sister, say something!

927
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,760
Speak! What are you doing just looking?

928
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,800
Ming'er, you tell the truth.

929
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,600
What happened?

930
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,280
Say it!

931
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,879
It…was Fourth Sister.

932
00:40:37,959 --> 00:40:40,439
She went before us.

933
00:40:41,479 --> 00:40:42,439
Little Sister!

934
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:44,159
How is that you're being forced by Fifth Sister

935
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:45,399
to talk nonsense?

936
00:40:46,919 --> 00:40:48,399
How did I force her?

937
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,360
She's clearly telling the truth!

938
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:54,919
I was indeed with the sisters.

939
00:40:55,959 --> 00:40:57,760
My sisters committed a mistake.

940
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,560
I failed to manage them well.

941
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,439
May Father punish me, too.

942
00:41:05,439 --> 00:41:07,439
so Fifth Sister's pacified.

943
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,679
Look at your sister!

944
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,600
Mo'er, you're more mature than they are.

945
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:17,879
You're a good child.

946
00:41:17,879 --> 00:41:19,600
You're always thinking of protecting them.

947
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,760
Rise.

948
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:23,159
Learn from your elder sister!

949
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:25,399
I'll never learn from her!

950
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,320
The hell with the good child.

951
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,479
She's a liar!

952
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,000
You are lying with her eyes open!

953
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,479
It was clearly your error!

954
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,520
How do you just listen to

955
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,959
that little witch?

956
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,679
You wouldn't listen to a word

957
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:41,520
my daughter said!

958
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,639
Look at your own daughter!

959
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:45,919
Didn't you see her just now?

960
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,120
So spoiled by you

961
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,919
that she's lawless now.

962
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,280
You didn't see it?

963
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,520
She was about to beat her!

964
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,439
First, she embarrassed herself

965
00:41:55,439 --> 00:41:56,600
before guests from outside.

966
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,719
Then she plotted to hit her elder sister.

967
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,639
Who knows

968
00:41:59,639 --> 00:42:01,479
what she might do tomorrow!

969
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,280
If I don't punish her now,

970
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,719
when should I?

971
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:06,919
Should I wait until she commits the gravest mistake?

972
00:42:06,919 --> 00:42:08,600
Then the two of us go before the ancestral hall

973
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,080
and cry to our ancestors?

974
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,800
The two of you were unruly

975
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,639
and startled the guests.

976
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:17,679
Go kneel in the ancestral shrine!

977
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,399
I didn't do anything wrong.

978
00:42:19,399 --> 00:42:21,360
She is framing me, clearly.

979
00:42:21,399 --> 00:42:23,320
I won't kneel!

980
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,159
You still insist you did nothing wrong?

981
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,520
Even if Mo'er wanted to push you,

982
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,719
you had to be there

983
00:42:29,719 --> 00:42:30,639
to be pushed!

984
00:42:31,879 --> 00:42:32,879
If you had been docile

985
00:42:32,879 --> 00:42:33,919
and staying in your room,

986
00:42:33,919 --> 00:42:34,600
quietly embroidering

987
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,280
and writing at home,

988
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,479
how would she push you?

989
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:39,600
Isn't it because you erred in

990
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,120
going to the front hall unsummoned in the first place?

991
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,320
Really!

992
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:48,080
I really didn't do anything wrong.

993
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,040
You're unreasonable, Father.

994
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,000
If I don't punish you well today,

995
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
you won't know your mistake!

996
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,719
You still want to hit her?

997
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,280
Do you still insist you're not wrong?

998
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,199
Then go to the shrine

999
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:06,840
and kneel for three days!

1000
00:43:06,919 --> 00:43:09,080
Reflect thoroughly.
