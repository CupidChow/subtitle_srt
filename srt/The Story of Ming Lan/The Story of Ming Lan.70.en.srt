00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,600
Episode 70

3
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,320
A few days ago,

4
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,897
he went to Fengxian's courtyard

5
00:01:05,897 --> 00:01:07,080
to make some inspections.

6
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,600
I harshly scolded him about it.

7
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,360
He even was smilingly

8
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,700
saying that I was jealous.

9
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,120
Why would I be jealous?

10
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,120
He always thinks for my sake,

11
00:01:18,615 --> 00:01:20,175
for my family.

12
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,320
He even locked Second Brother up.

13
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,280
I won't be jealous anymore.

14
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,040
Madam.

15
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,440
I...

16
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,600
What's wrong?

17
00:01:38,845 --> 00:01:40,480
Marquis got detained in the palace!

18
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,520
Ming'er! Ming'er!

19
00:01:48,535 --> 00:01:49,175
Madam.

20
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,720
Ru'an! Bring us some ginger soup!

21
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,425
Second Young Master.

22
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:09,400
The kitchen made your favorite

23
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,400
sprout vegetable soup.

24
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,960
Old Madam even instructed

25
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,280
to give you more.

26
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,400
Second Young Master,

27
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,400
come and have a taste.

28
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,360
What soup?

29
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,520
Sprout vegetable soup.

30
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,045
This is your favourite.

31
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,000
No! No! Second Young Master! Second Young Master!

32
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,310
Second Young Master!

33
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,700
Second Young Master!

34
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,850
Lower your voice.

35
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,200
Second Young Master, let me go! Hurry!

36
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,000
Second Young Master,

37
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,320
Second Young Master, let me go!

38
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:49,360
let me go!

39
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,640
let me go, Second Young Master!

40
00:02:53,565 --> 00:02:54,640
Second Young Master!

41
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,560
let me go!

42
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,000
let me go!

43
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:14,840
let me go!

44
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,480
Second Young Master.

45
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,560
Second Young Master, please enjoy your meal.

46
00:03:37,205 --> 00:03:38,040
How dare you!

47
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,920
Unruly!

48
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,280
General! General !

49
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,360
I don't care all about these!

50
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,400
I must see

51
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,320
my marquis husband!

52
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,360
Little sister-in-law,

53
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,350
I personally went to beg for leniency,

54
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,280
but no one gave a damn.

55
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,760
Even if you go, I'm afraid that it won't work.

56
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,040
No, I must go.

57
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,840
You have a conferred title.

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,320
You can enter the palace anytime.

59
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,640
I'll prepare your visitation request now

60
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,680
and submit it.

61
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,200
I'm sure that there will be a reply by tomorrow.

62
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,500
It won't work!

63
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,640
The palace has refused

64
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,510
five of my invitation requests already.

65
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,160
This...

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,839
If there's no more way,

67
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,800
I'll just charge my way into the palace.

68
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,200
Don't fret.

69
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,360
Their Wang Family can drum the Dengwen Drums.

70
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,080
Why can't I?

71
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,720
Their daughter wanted to kill me!

72
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,360
That's the truth!

73
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,280
I'm the victim and witness here!

74
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,160
I'm not yet dead!

75
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,120
Must I just let their family

76
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,400
distort the truth like that

77
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,920
and falsely accuse my marquis husband?!

78
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:46,875
Shitou.

79
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:47,840
Xiaotao!

80
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,280
Madam, I'm driving the carriage for you.

81
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,560
Minglan! Minglan!

82
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,600
You can't do it like that.

83
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,160
You're being muddled.

84
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,520
His Majesty currently is just angry for a moment.

85
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,840
If you charge into the palace

86
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,720
and escalate this matter,

87
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,640
even if the emperor

88
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,640
wants to defend him,

89
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,400
I fear that he won't be able to continue it anymore.

90
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,200
What should I do then?

91
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,120
Must I get trapped here outside,

92
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,040
in this pitch dark night,

93
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:19,960
and wait for him?

94
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,000
Wait for him while unsure of his safety?

95
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,600
My good sister,

96
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,120
you're unable to enter the palace,

97
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,240
but I can.

98
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,200
You still won't admit your mistakes?

99
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,650
Just try still not admitting your mistakes!

100
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,400
You're just going to rush to the Kaifeng Precinct like that?

101
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,520
Your mother, your grandmother,

102
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,560
and I,

103
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,880
we all will be painfully hurt by you!

104
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,720
The future of your sisters

105
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,080
and your little brother,

106
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,080
you don't care about them anymore?

107
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,080
You even were 13th on your first try in the imperial civil examination.

108
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,720
How much of the loyal and filial virtues

109
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,680
have you remembered?!

110
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:05,000
Correcting the mistakes of the king is being loyal!

111
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,400
You're the only one who understands, is that it?!

112
00:06:06,907 --> 00:06:09,760
Holding up the sky for one's family...Just you know!

113
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,920
is being filial!

114
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,960
In the whole family, you're the only most filial one?

115
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,000
Being a model son is being respectful!

116
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,960
Just continue talking!

117
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,440
Just continue answering back!

118
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,800
Arguing for the law... All right!

119
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,960
is what integrity should be!

120
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,640
Let me hit you loyal, filial, respectful,

121
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,560
and man of integrity then!

122
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,880
You even claim that supporting the sky for your family is being filial.

123
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,000
Our Sheng Family's sky will be falling soon!

124
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,875
When I was young,

125
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,280
our Sheng Family was in a fallen state

126
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,640
and suffered the supercilious look of others.

127
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,600
I made an ambitious oath that

128
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,880
I will make our family prestigious.

129
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,320
I was diligent in striving hard, hence,

130
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,480
was able to obtain a little achievement.

131
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,560
But I dare not slack off

132
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,480
even for a little.

133
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,800
But you?

134
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:05,760
What?

135
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,120
Our Sheng Family...

136
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,000
Do you want our Sheng Family

137
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,640
to be dragged down by that Madam Kang

138
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,680
and end up in a dire strait?

139
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,800
Changbai,

140
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,160
you are a person who is highly favored by the emperor.

141
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,480
Looking at your path

142
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,920
of an outstanding official,

143
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,200
you don't want it anymore?

144
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,320
Okay.

145
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,440
You don't want it.

146
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,680
Don't you care about the numerous members

147
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,600
of our House of Sheng too?

148
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,760
Drag him out.

149
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:06,800
Tie him up. Tie him up!

150
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,160
Tie him up!

151
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,280
My ancestors...

152
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,680
My ancestors.

153
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:43,160
My ancestors...

154
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,760
Your Highness,

155
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,920
you're not believing that

156
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,040
those damn acts were done by Gu Marquis, right?

157
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,040
No need for beating around the bush

158
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,880
in testing me.

159
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,680
That Gu Second was indeed too much of a scoundrel.

160
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,760
The emperor lately feels unwell.

161
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,720
To put it bluntly,

162
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,160
you all also know

163
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,520
that he deliberately incited these troubles.

164
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,560
causing the government to be in chaos.

165
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,160
Relying on his good relationship with my Ying,

166
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,080
he now fears nothing.

167
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,200
Unable to put out the murder weapon

168
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,960
and only expecting

169
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,520
the emperor to defend me.

170
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,160
Those people from the Wang鈥檚 are telling lies!

171
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,040
That Little Qin has colluded with them!

172
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,050
Minglan!

173
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,000
Even if my husband indeed did a grave mistake,

174
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,760
it was only because he was too eager to protect me.

175
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,440
Must he not do nothing

176
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,600
when he already saw someone

177
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,940
trying to kill me?

178
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,440
The Bai Family assets,

179
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,840
and the killing of his father and son,

180
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,960
all are lies.

181
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,520
They are only telling half of the story,

182
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,120
and that half is even fake.

183
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,816
Your Highness,

184
00:10:01,816 --> 00:10:02,896
do you trust him?

185
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,560
Of course, I trust your Gu Marquis.

186
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:07,960
But now,

187
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,880
the House of Wang

188
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,680
indeed lost a daughter.

189
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,880
This matter can't be justified.

190
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,480
Your Highness,

191
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,040
the Bai Family and Little Qin want

192
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,800
to destroy our house,

193
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,040
and break up His Majesty

194
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,210
from his trusted aide.

195
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,480
Minglan. Your Highness.

196
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,450
Minglan!

197
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,940
Good child.

198
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,080
I understand your suffering.

199
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,320
Let's just leave everything to His Majesty's wise judgment.

200
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,920
Go back first and wait for news.

201
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,640
Your Highness.

202
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,240
Minglan.

203
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,000
Your Highness!

204
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,760
What have you become锛?

205
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,320
Let me go.

206
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,040
You can proceed with the case,

207
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,040
but why must he be locked up

208
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,280
inside this palace?

209
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,325
Your Highness,

210
00:10:47,325 --> 00:10:48,950
he...won't be fleeing.

211
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,600
If Your Majesty still can't be at ease,

212
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,880
you can just send

213
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,625
the Jin Imperial Army

214
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,480
to the guard in our house.

215
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,880
Your Highness! Minglan!

216
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,400
Do you still even know the law?

217
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,880
Minglan, quickly let go.

218
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:02,520
The law should have a proper procedure being followed.

219
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,440
In law, there should

220
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,440
be punishment for the one who committed a mistake,

221
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,640
reward for anyone with merits.

222
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,650
Your Highness,

223
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,840
my husband and I

224
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,200
have given our all to come up with strategies

225
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,120
for Your Majesty and Your Highness.

226
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,200
We've long offended the Empress Dowager.

227
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,560
Minglan, what nonsense are you saying?

228
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,420
Quickly shut up!

229
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,080
Your Highness! Your Highness,

230
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,080
I beg you to understand her!

231
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,040
I beg you to pity her

232
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,000
for encountering such a matter

233
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,840
when she's less than a month postpartum.

234
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,600
Your Highness!

235
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,360
This palace is full of Empress Dowager's spies.

236
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,240
How could he be safe here?

237
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,560
What nonsense are you saying?!

238
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,520
Your Highness!

239
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,560
Madam Sheng,

240
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,960
I know that you and Gu Marquis

241
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,920
did a lot for us.

242
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,640
But now,

243
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,960
there is indeed a kin

244
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,000
of an important official who died.

245
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,840
Be obedient. Don't worry.

246
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,360
Go back first and wait for news.

247
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,560
Your Highness!

248
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,040
It...was my... Thank Your Highness.

249
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,680
It was my husband who delivered the imperial decree

250
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,480
for the throne succession in behalf of the past emperor!

251
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,160
Minglan!

252
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:49,920
Cutting through thorns and thistles,

253
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,640
it was me who delivered that succession decree!

254
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,120
Your Highness!

255
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,040
Stop saying it, Minglan!

256
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,800
Your Highness!

257
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,360
Minglan!

258
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,310
His Majesty owes me a reward!

259
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,560
Servant! Servant!

260
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,400
Drag this crazy woman away!

261
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,480
Wait!

262
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,560
Go back and prepare some items

263
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,840
to visit Gu Marquis in the inner palace hall.

264
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,260
When I heard from you last time

265
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,960
that your wife loves Princess Ping Yangshao

266
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,040
that guarded

267
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,040
the Niangzi Pass,

268
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,240
I already knew that she has

269
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,840
the personality of riding horse and going into battle.

270
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,480
Now, really great.

271
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:50,280
She made a scene in my Imperial Mother's palace,

272
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,680
leaving my mother

273
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,080
with no choice.

274
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,120
She agreed to let her visit you

275
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,840
in a short while.

276
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:57,960
Are you happy now?

277
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,650
She created a scene?

278
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,725
She really did?!

279
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,920
Were you there?

280
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,000
If I was there,

281
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,040
I would have kicked her out.

282
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,560
You were not there,

283
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,160
so why are you spouting these nonsense to me?

284
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,080
Quickly! Quickly!

285
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,200
Go look for someone who was there

286
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,840
to answer my questions!

287
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,280
What is there to ask about?

288
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,520
How could there be none?!

289
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,040
My wife has never

290
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,120
acted atrociously to me.

291
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,760
I've never seen her make a scene!

292
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,360
You...quickly leave.

293
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,240
Quickly find someone

294
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,480
to answer my questions.

295
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,960
No, are you crazy!

296
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,980
Go. Go. Go.

297
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,260
Quickly. Quickly.

298
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,760
My Ye'er has a hard fate

299
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,600
all his life.

300
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,600
He lost his mother when he was young.

301
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,200
He thought that his stepmother was a Bodhisattva.

302
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,800
Who knew that after wiping her face,

303
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,360
she's actually a monster.

304
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,360
His father was also harsh on him.

305
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,775
That extremely evil Manniang,

306
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,660
actually had the heart to deceive him.

307
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,640
I thought that his hard life has finally ended

308
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,040
when he married you.

309
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:16,960
But who knew...

310
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,800
Who knew that

311
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,320
those scoundrels next door

312
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,520
just won't let him off.

313
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,475
These past days,

314
00:14:28,475 --> 00:14:30,600
I've been investigating the poisoning matter,

315
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,040
and was unable to find anything.

316
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,960
I'm so useless.

317
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,560
Nanny,

318
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,880
I can save him.

319
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,200
I surely can save him.

320
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:57,760
Madam.

321
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,240
Big Madam is here.

322
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,440
She wants to see you in private.

323
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,240
Main Mother.

324
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,160
Ming'er!

325
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,200
Mother is worried about you.

326
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,800
Stop saying those useless things.

327
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,320
What really

328
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,240
is your plan now?

329
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,920
How do you want me to think?

330
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,440
Everything is my fault.

331
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,280
Mother told me numerous times

332
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,400
not to have any dealings with my older sister,

333
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,880
but I just wouldn't listen.

334
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,560
Now, it led to a huge disaster

335
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,760
and even dragged your marquis husband in it.

336
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,560
When mother learned that something bad happened to our family,

337
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,800
she repeatedly begged father and grandmother,

338
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,760
hence, was temporarily pardoned

339
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,120
to return here and visit you.

340
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,160
But because she was afraid that the Wang鈥檚 will get mad,

341
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,960
so she traveled at night and cloaked in black.

342
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,720
Sixth Little Sister,

343
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,280
look at how concerned mother is about you.

344
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,640
Yes. Yes.

345
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,600
On the way here,

346
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,760
I've carefully thought about it.

347
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,240
What if, I just mean what if,

348
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,680
What if you and your marquis husband amicably separate

349
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,440
after his marquis title has been taken away?

350
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,720
Then this child

351
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,360
will become the son of a criminal.

352
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,320
I know that

353
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,760
my words might be harsh,

354
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,920
but as a mother,

355
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,600
you must think more for the sake of your child.

356
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,240
Main Mother,

357
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,920
I know everything

358
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,160
that you're saying now.

359
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,080
It's hard even for a person

360
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,040
that's very close to me to mention them.

361
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,400
You even risked danger to come say it.

362
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,080
You are thinking for my sake.

363
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,650
I told you.

364
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,400
Your Sixth Little Sister would understand.

365
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,280
Your marquis husband hasn't been sentenced

366
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,480
of any crimes yet.

367
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,560
Amicably separate now and live in our manor,

368
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,920
and you'll still be a daughter of the Sheng Family

369
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,640
and the child a Sheng descendant.

370
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,520
Changbai currently is quite successful in his career.

371
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,280
He surely will have a good future ahead.

372
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,560
With this child

373
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,120
having the protection of his uncle,

374
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,200
no one would dare criticize him.

375
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,200
If you love Gu Second,

376
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,440
once this matter is over,

377
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,800
you two can still get back together.

378
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,160
But if it won't end,

379
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,520
you're still able to preserve the child.

380
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,520
This child is also his child.

381
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,200
That's right.

382
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,185
I know that what you're saying

383
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,680
are all sincere words.

384
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,200
But since we're married as husband and wife,

385
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,040
we then should be of one voice and one breath,

386
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,640
one heart and one fate.

387
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,520
Child,

388
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,400
it's fine for our family

389
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,440
to suffer some hardships.

390
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,920
But your child

391
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,400
is still too little.

392
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,960
Mother,

393
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,280
in the past, it has always been him protecting me.

394
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,080
Now, let me be the one to defend him.

395
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,520
Ming'er,

396
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,880
your marquis husband dotes on you so much.

397
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,960
If he know what you're doing,

398
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,720
his heart will surely break up.

399
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,060
I have made my decision.

400
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,560
Never thought that they provide you adequate charcoal.

401
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,800
Looks like you won't need this

402
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,000
animal skin blanket anymore.

403
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,475
But you still keep it.

404
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,120
You can cover yourself with it

405
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,840
when you feel cold at night.

406
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,440
I fear that you won't be needing that chess set anymore.

407
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,040
I'll just take it back with me.

408
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,480
Those books...

409
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:37,320
are all southern opera songs.

410
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,560
Just read them for some fun.

411
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,640
It's different from

412
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,320
the books you have here.

413
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,860
This...

414
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,260
I was afraid that you're cold.

415
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,340
It's better that I just take them back with me.

416
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,860
I'm cold right now.

417
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,430
A few days ago,

418
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:25,200
I heard that you went to the palace

419
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,800
of Her Highness Empress

420
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,080
and created a scene.

421
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:31,440
Yes. You're happy now?

422
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,160
I know that you're anxious for me.

423
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,720
You even thought of charging into the palace.

424
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,000
I'm happy.

425
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,040
I'm happier than wearing any animal skin cape.

426
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,680
I won't bring anything

427
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,880
the next time I come then.

428
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:47,880
I'll just roll over

429
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,840
in front of you.

430
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,240
This was personally made by your birth mother.

431
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,160
That time, she didn't know

432
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,240
that you will become my husband.

433
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,960
If she knew that you're going to be her son-in-law,

434
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,720
she surely would have embroidered a tiger on this.

435
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,320
You're more energetic

436
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,880
when you were young.

437
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,680
Do you still remember

438
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,960
how I was back then?

439
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,040
When we were playing touhu,

440
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,640
I thought,

441
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,520
"Can this little girl really play?"

442
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,240
Never thought that you can throw so accurately.

443
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,270
I remember that...

444
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:43,080
I remember how you looked when you were

445
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,720
looking for a doctor for my mother in Yangzhou Street.

446
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:48,840
I've always remembered.

447
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,000
I also remember that.

448
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,560
In my heart,

449
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,760
I've always been grateful to you.

450
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,480
But afterwards,

451
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,200
I realized that there are too many things

452
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,400
that I should thank you for.

453
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,000
The person that I should be most grateful to is your mother.

454
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,040
Because she gave birth to you.

455
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,040
I asked Tu Second and Shitou

456
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,600
to search the whole Bianjing.

457
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,360
They couldn't find any traces of Eldest Bai

458
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,440
and Manniang.

459
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:33,120
They are the best dagger.

460
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,240
Now, I've gotten locked up in here.

461
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:40,400
How could they let you

462
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,840
find them so easily?

463
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,600
They did so many sins.

464
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,000
We'll eventually find them.

465
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,400
They surely will leave some clues.

466
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,640
Let's amicably separate.

467
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,560
I've written the separation letter.

468
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,800
Even the separation of assets,

469
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,160
I've also written it

470
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,840
and left it to Prince Huan.

471
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,840
I'll leave Shitou

472
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,520
and Tu Second to you.

473
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,800
Let them protect and take care of you

474
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,680
and our child.

475
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,880
That lad, Shitou,

476
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,160
likes your maidservant Xiaotao.

477
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,560
The two of them have mutual affection.

478
00:23:35,975 --> 00:23:36,925
You...

479
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,280
try to be the matchmaker

480
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,000
and just fulfill their wish.

481
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,160
You want to divorce me?

482
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,725
Amicable separation.

483
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,960
It's not divorcing. Just amicable separation.

484
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,520
Once I get released,

485
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,320
I'll marry you again.

486
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,880
What did you say

487
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,720
when you married me?

488
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:05,320
You even said that you'll

489
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,000
be my sky and earth.

490
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,040
Now...

491
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,880
You're saying that you're divorcing me?

492
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,560
Presently, the House of Wang, House of Qin,

493
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,720
and the Remonstrance Bureau

494
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,480
have Empress Dowager's forces.

495
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,720
Among the ordinary citizens, the gossip about me

496
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,080
has also been spreading like wildfire.

497
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,825
They say that I'm arrogant and overbearing,

498
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,640
that I brag about my great contributions,

499
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,225
just casually killing people,

500
00:24:41,225 --> 00:24:42,080
and couldn't be tried for my crimes.

501
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,160
The emperor...is also currently...

502
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,640
He fears and doubts Prince Huan,

503
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,120
so he surely fears and doubts you too.

504
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,920
Right.

505
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,160
Hence, you feel that

506
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,640
your noble title will surely be removed and you'll get imprisoned.

507
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,950
Hence, you insist on amicably separating with me.

508
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,360
Empress Dowager is hell bent on toppling me.

509
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,760
His Majesty is also wavering.

510
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,250
What did I tell you before?

511
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,120
I told you to be careful.

512
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,520
Stop being so unrestrained

513
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,600
just because you have some old affection with them.

514
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,520
But you just wouldn't listen.

515
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,320
I'm wrong.

516
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,040
I'm wrong.

517
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,320
I can't continue being wrong.

518
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,400
We must amicably separate now.

519
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,720
No way!

520
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,400
You'll be in danger if you stay with me.

521
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,080
Even if you don't want to think for yourself,

522
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,480
think for the sake of your grandmother.

523
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,080
She just recovered from her illness.

524
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,920
Just for this matter, if she gets agitated and mad,

525
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,680
what then?

526
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,960
What storm has my grandmother not seen?

527
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:15,840
There are still our child,

528
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,640
Rong'er, Nanny Chang.

529
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,320
I can only depend on you.

530
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,300
I've thought about it.

531
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,100
If I die,

532
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,280
the child will be raised

533
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,520
by Brother Changbai.

534
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:32,920
Before, you also...wanted

535
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,160
Brother Changbai

536
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,200
to be our child's teacher.

537
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,200
By doing that,

538
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,880
we're not really troubling others.

539
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,080
What die?

540
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,200
We still haven't even give our child a name.

541
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,160
I already did.

542
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,040
His name is Tuan'er.

543
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,440
Your child and I will wait for you to reunite with us.

544
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:54,960
Tuan'er.

545
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,000
Okay.

546
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,480
Okay.

547
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,120
Are you still

548
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,680
amicably separating?

549
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:26,560
Amicably...

550
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:33,920
Amicably separate.

551
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,600
The future days are long.

552
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,120
If we're unable to get past this obstacle,

553
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,050
we also won't in the future.

554
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,320
This child can't really forever live

555
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,040
in a blessed and happy house like Cheng Garden.

556
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,000
Being able to see how the real world is upon being born

557
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,920
is good too.

558
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,040
But Gu Tingye,

559
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,000
you better think about it clearly.

560
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,800
Once we amicably separate

561
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,800
and you decide to turn back,

562
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,800
I won't have you anymore.

563
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
If you won't have me,

564
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,800
who will you have?

565
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:20,920
Yuanruo is already married.

566
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:22,880
Not wanting me...

567
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:26,040
In this world, not only his ducal house of Qi has a young duke.

568
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,720
There's one in the ducal state of Zhen

569
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,100
and in Prince Ru Manor.

570
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,320
Prince Ru's son

571
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,480
is only 12 years old this year.

572
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,000
Prince Ru Manor...

573
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,200
If you sign the separation letter,

574
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,160
you... I...

575
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:44,600
Let's distance ourselves from each other afterwards.

576
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,840
You have no right to meddle with

577
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,680
my affairs from now on.

578
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,720
Moreover,

579
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,680
Brother Hongwen isn't married yet.

580
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,200
I remember that day,

581
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,160
in the polo field,

582
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,575
when I proposed marriage to you,

583
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,920
I told you that

584
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,880
I won't let you suffer from now on.

585
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,760
But you...

586
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,520
Since you married me, the grievances you suffered

587
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,320
were more than before.

588
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,680
Sometimes,

589
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,440
I would think that I shouldn't have

590
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,160
obtained you by deception and force,

591
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,360
making such a huge circle

592
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,080
just to marry you.

593
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,640
If you are currently married to Qi Heng,

594
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,840
or to He Hongwen,

595
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,200
maybe, you would only deal with harem fights.

596
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,560
It won't be as bloody and stormy

597
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,680
like my Gu Family.

598
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,720
I didn't marry other people.

599
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,360
I only married you.

600
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,960
Okay.

601
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,960
Okay.

602
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,400
It's still better to marry me.

603
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,700
Am I right?

604
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,200
Don't be too anxious.

605
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,560
Prince Huan and your marquis husband

606
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,400
have such good relationship,

607
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,480
and he is our general鈥榮 nephew.

608
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,400
Even for the sake of brotherhood,

609
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,960
he surely will beg emperor and empress

610
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,960
for some leniency.

611
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,200
It's better not to talk about such favors for now.

612
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,880
Let's just talk about this case full of false accusations.

613
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,120
If only we can find a witness or evidence,

614
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,840
as long as we can find only one,

615
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,080
we can then delay the time.

616
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,440
That is an imperial decree, an imperial decree.

617
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,960
Gu Tingye, listen to the imperial decree.

618
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,240
I decree

619
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,600
that Gu Tingye, the Deputy Commander of the Palace Command,

620
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,280
belonging to the Wukang Military Rank,

621
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,880
the Yangzhou Governor responsible in monitoring

622
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,000
and handling the affairs Yangzhou,

623
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,600
given the duty to manage the military matters of Yangzhou,

624
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,200
the High State Pillar, Marquis of Ningyuan,

625
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,440
with lands encompassing 1,900 tenant households,

626
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,520
conferred lands with 300 households because of his noble title,

627
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,500
because of saving the past emperor,

628
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,840
he became a right hand man,

629
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,720
he has repeatedly achieved great merits for the state,

630
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,360
in payment for his grand salary,

631
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,150
he doesn't think twice in serving loyally as a way of

632
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,680
giving back to the imperial favor he honorably enjoys.

633
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,240
Every time he is unbridled,

634
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,560
he would rely on his power for harboring

635
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,000
and waiting for an opportunity.

636
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,225
He is rash and careless,

637
00:32:06,225 --> 00:32:07,760
eventually killing an official's wife.

638
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,150
As an official, he was corrupt,

639
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:10,760
forcefully seizing the assets of normal citizens.

640
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,840
There were documents presented and complaint letters written.

641
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,475
There are overflowing signs of his evil deeds,

642
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:16,920
and his infamous reputation is widespread.

643
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,360
Lacks self-repentance and claims to be innocent.

644
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,250
Full of rudeness and arrogance

645
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,950
that's been unheard of.

646
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,400
He brought disgrace to the marquis title,

647
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,280
a real taint to a clean governance.

648
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,880
The conferred titles of Gu Tingye

649
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,650
and those of his wife and child

650
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,920
are being taken away and destroyed.

651
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,680
Gu Tingye will be imprisoned

652
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,760
and then exiled as a servant 2,000 miles from here after the autumn.

653
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,000
Marquis,

654
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,760
please accept the imperial decree and thank His Majesty's graces.

655
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,600
No...Sir!

656
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,960
Sir! Sir, he's innocent! Sir!

657
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,325
Sir! Minglan!

658
00:32:52,325 --> 00:32:53,720
He's innocent!

659
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,560
Sir!

660
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,120
Marquis Husband! Marquis Husband!

661
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,640
Yuanruo.

662
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,000
Mother.

663
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,025
It's already late.

664
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,200
Where do you plan to go

665
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,160
while wearing such dark clothes?

666
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,520
I'm seeing a friend.

667
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,400
You don't know how to lie since you were young.

668
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,200
It's written all over your face.

669
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,880
Since mother knows,

670
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,080
why then must you still ask?

671
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,760
Sheng Minglan is now someone's wife.

672
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,550
Whatever happens to her husband

673
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,400
is not your business.

674
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,875
Why still go?

675
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,680
Mother, don't have skewed thoughts.

676
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,960
Now, Marquis of Ningyuan has been found guilty.

677
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,400
Who aren't avoiding passing through the gates of the House of Gu,

678
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,240
so they won't get implicated?

679
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,120
How come you must get involved

680
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,000
in this muddled water?

681
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:28,240
I believe that Second Uncle is innocent.

682
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,000
Stop right there.

683
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,080
Mother.

684
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,280
Why are you here?

685
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:46,360
Husband, don't you know why I'm here?

686
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:47,595
What?

687
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,520
You also want to stop me?

688
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,560
You also don't believe me?

689
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,960
What stopping and not believing?

690
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,525
Husband, you said last month

691
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,960
you'll have less documents to handle tonight.

692
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,160
We agreed that

693
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,520
you'll take me to a meal in Fan House.

694
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,320
When did I say that?

695
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,560
What did you say?

696
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,880
Husband has forgotten it because of being too busy.

697
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,480
But for fun things like that,

698
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,240
I didn't forget.

699
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,360
There's a new shop inside Fan House

700
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,640
that has a new snow wine.

701
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,720
They used the first snow from last year.

702
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,760
I'll bring mother

703
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,480
some back later.

704
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,280
it will be warming to your stomach

705
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,200
for this winter once you've heated it.

706
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,120
What have you been

707
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,160
busying about all day?

708
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,160
You should be accompanying your wife more.

709
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,680
You would even forget about such things?

710
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,280
If husband goes back with your promise again,

711
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,880
I'm going to make a scene and cry hard this time.

712
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,840
Change your clothes first before leaving.

713
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,840
It's so late and you're wearing such dark clothes.

714
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,320
Be careful of getting trampled by others.

715
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,560
I'll get you some clothes.

716
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,400
Husband,

717
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,560
you don't look happy.

718
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,080
Change the route!

719
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,450
We're not going to Fan House.

720
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:50,760
Go to Cheng Garden.

721
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,760
Husband, you've been restless today.

722
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,400
But I know mother-in-law's temper.

723
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,840
She will never let you be out of the house.

724
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,920
Are you happy now?

725
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,000
I'm happy, too.

726
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,000
My virtuous nephew couple aren't afraid of

727
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,160
getting implicated in our family's case,

728
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,240
and even came to visit me and my child.

729
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,120
I am very grateful.

730
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,600
The two of us were classmates once.

731
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,640
The House of Qi and Gu are also relatives.

732
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:52,800
It's just properly that we do this.

733
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,500
Madam Sheng,

734
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,280
you must take care of your health.

735
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,480
You still must keep everything propped up.

736
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,240
I've seen your house's Grand Madam

737
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,040
and the other two houses

738
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,240
several times.

739
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,120
They are quite hard to deal with.

740
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,040
You must be very careful.

741
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,480
I understand.

742
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,920
I've already decided

743
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,200
to write a complaint

744
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,480
narrating my painful grievances

745
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,000
and then beat the Dengwen Drums

746
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,280
But beating the Dengwen Drums

747
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,880
will escalate this matter until it's irremediable.

748
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,600
If Sixth Little Sister trusts me,

749
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,320
then hand me the complaint letter.

750
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,880
I'll submit it on your behalf.

751
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,600
If beating the Dengwen Drums doesn't work,

752
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,920
I'll bow in front of the Imperial Ancestral Hall.

753
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,080
If they weren't afraid to escalate this matter,

754
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,120
so am I.

755
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,760
How can you be this muddled?

756
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,480
That's exactly going against the emperor!

757
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,011
Empress Dowager surely will be so happy

758
00:38:50,011 --> 00:38:51,051
to light firecrackers in the inner palace.

759
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,760
I'll submit it for you.

760
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,240
I surely will personally hand it

761
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,160
to His Majesty's hands.

762
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,680
This is an affair of our Gu Family.

763
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,280
It should be our people

764
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,080
going forward to seek justice.

765
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,760
If we pass it through other people's hands,

766
00:39:17,045 --> 00:39:18,720
it make us look insincere.

767
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,280
I also don't want to

768
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,640
implicate you.

769
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,000
Let's do not talk about how to submit the complaint letter first.

770
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,920
May I ask if Madam has any new reasons

771
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,960
for filing your complaint?

772
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,400
What?

773
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,480
This case has been discussed for several days

774
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,600
and has been abuzz in the whole capital.

775
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,320
All the details have been

776
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,360
gone over in the court.

777
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,640
If you don't have any new stand,

778
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,080
even if you are able to appear in front of His Majesty,

779
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,600
it will all just be some old issues,

780
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,560
just big talks that's being turned and rementioned.

781
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,960
Even if His Majesty has intentions to save him,

782
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,240
he won't have the strength to.

783
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,440
Madam,

784
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,000
you have never been a person that's reckless and rash.

785
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,880
How come this time...

786
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,160
I...didn't think that much.

787
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,000
I just feel that,

788
00:40:14,225 --> 00:40:15,840
even if I risk my life,

789
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,880
I must fight my case

790
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,760
until the very end.

791
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,920
You're being muddled because of caring too much.

792
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,520
If we don't have any new evidence,

793
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,760
it's better that you don't complain.

794
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,400
What Hezhen said is very right.

795
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,920
Sixth Little Sister,

796
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,640
we must aim to make a sure hit.

797
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,840
Don't act recklessly.

798
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,120
That House of Bai,

799
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,240
and...that person...

800
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,250
Zhu Manniang.

801
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,825
Right.

802
00:40:51,825 --> 00:40:53,880
We'll help you find them.

803
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,246
If we find any evidence,

804
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:57,320
then let's gather them.

805
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,920
These past days, someone's been poisoning me.

806
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,160
I still haven't found out who he is.

807
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,680
What?

808
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,800
This is a good thing.

809
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,800
I understand.

810
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,040
These people who is harming me

811
00:41:16,325 --> 00:41:17,840
and those that harmed my marquis husband

812
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,440
Must be connected.

813
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,920
Even if it didn't,

814
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,320
as long as you grab hold of a chance,

815
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,400
then pester His Majesty with it.

816
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,840
This case now is chaotic.

817
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:30,800
As long as you stir it more,

818
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,160
we'll then have time to collect evidences.

819
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,120
It's way better than bringing up past details in front of the emperor.

820
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,040
You said it so right.

821
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,840
Sixth Little Sister,

822
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,480
the reason you're unable to catch them

823
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,080
is because they're hiding in the dark,

824
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,360
while you're out in the open.

825
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,800
Why not put some disorder in your house?

826
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,250
The more disordered, the better it is.

827
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,350
The more disordered it is,

828
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:55,040
the more that person would want to make a move.

829
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,720
If he doesn't make a move,

830
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,120
that person behind him

831
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,040
will also force him to do so.

832
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,040
Even if I don't want things to be chaotic,

833
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,480
someone will try to smash things and make it so.
