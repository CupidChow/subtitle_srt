00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,835
Episode 62

3
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,280
How is she?

4
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:16,920
Sister-in-law.

5
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,383
Father and I agreed that

6
00:01:18,383 --> 00:01:19,720
I would accompany Grandmother at night.

7
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,040
You have two kids,

8
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,320
so you should go and rest.

9
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,480
Father-in-law isn't coming?

10
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,960
Mother isn't coming either.

11
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,280
You're with child,

12
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,360
so you can't get too tired.

13
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,440
It's true.

14
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,080
Big Madam, be assured.

15
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,080
Shuoan Hall has many hands.

16
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,000
We can't really have Miss watch all night.

17
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,440
We won't wear her out.

18
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,680
It's just to put Old Madam to ease.

19
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,200
Yes.

20
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,760
Since that's the case,

21
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,000
I won't be too cordial.

22
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,720
If something happens,

23
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,720
no matter how late, come get me.

24
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,180
I thank you deeply, Sister-in-law.

25
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,520
We'll trouble you.

26
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,360
Mother Fang.

27
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,600
Miss.

28
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:40,920
Mother Fang,

29
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,680
close all of Shuoan Hall in and out.

30
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,200
Do not let anyone pass through easily or ask for news.

31
00:02:47,025 --> 00:02:50,160
We need to record all people in and out.

32
00:02:52,675 --> 00:02:54,280
Yes.

33
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:02,960
Sir.

34
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,600
You are most trusted by General Shen.

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,640
Last time with the delivery,

36
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,600
it was all dependent on you.

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,320
That kept Sister Zhang alive.

38
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,960
I imagine you must be skilled as well as kind.

39
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,680
I won't beat around the bush.

40
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,960
I only ask you for the truth.

41
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,680
Please tell me.

42
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,840
How did my grandmother fall ill?

43
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,600
Old Madam's illness is indeed peculiar.

44
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,400
She had severe stomachache in the afternoon.

45
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,000
Vomit and diarrhea.

46
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,320
Her body is in a continuous twitch.

47
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,400
It doesn't look like an illness, is that right?

48
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:50,960
You're sage.

49
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,120
It doesn't look like an illness.

50
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,600
It looks like poison.

51
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,840
What did Grandmother eat today?

52
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,200
What did she drink and what was she wearing?

53
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,280
Old Madam only ate breakfast and lunch today.

54
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,440
She didn't eat much

55
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,320
and all that was left was poured into the slop bucket.

56
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,480
It's all still there

57
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,200
but the smell.

58
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,880
Just the stuff made by our kitchen?

59
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,720
Miss, you know it.

60
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,440
Our Old Madam has been devout for decades

61
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,480
and she's never been a food-glutton.

62
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,640
Every bite is remembered.

63
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,120
And servants in kitchen are here for decades

64
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,680
and their lives are in our yard.

65
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,640
Then . . .

66
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,280
Was there anything else?

67
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,240
Something unexpected.

68
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,160
Old Madam is elderly now.

69
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,160
She suddenly likes to eat sweet.

70
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,840
Jufang Pagoda has an aging chef.

71
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,320
He makes the best lotus seed cakes in the capital.

72
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,880
But this chef is elderly too.

73
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,560
So he only makes them personally twice in a month.

74
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,720
Old Madam would always have someone go

75
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,680
and wait to buy.

76
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,760
Speak.

77
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,920
Keep going.

78
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,000
Miss, you know.

79
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,560
Young Master Quan is most obedient to Old Madam, his great-grandmother.

80
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,760
Old Madam said

81
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,560
Master Quan was old enough to know the customs.

82
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,600
So she's having him go

83
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,000
and greet Big Madam daily.

84
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,400
Big Madam was very grateful

85
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,800
so she sent someone to wait at Jufang Pagoda

86
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,040
when it's still dark

87
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,360
to buy steaming hot cakes for Old Madam

88
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,040
as show of devotion.

89
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,800
So . . .

90
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,440
this was sent by Big Madam too?

91
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,200
But it's been going on for months

92
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,760
and we've never had an issue.

93
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,880
Miss.

94
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,360
Here.

95
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,520
Look.

96
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,280
I don't think it would be Big Madam.

97
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,600
What's wrong, Sir?

98
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,840
Sir?

99
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,040
What a scary scheme.

100
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,440
Ginkgo sprout.

101
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,040
What?

102
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,040
Ginkgo is edible.

103
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,840
But ginkgo sprout is not edible.

104
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,800
Technically it is not considered poison

105
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,720
and it's not detectable by the silver needle.

106
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,200
But if you take the ginkgo sprout,

107
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,720
and squeeze out the juice.

108
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,960
the small part extracted from

109
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,680
lots of it

110
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,560
is fatal to human.

111
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,720
Then . . .

112
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,160
is there a way to save her?

113
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,800
Thank goodness Old Madam didn't eat too much.

114
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,160
If she had eaten more,

115
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,480
even the Great God can't save her.

116
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,960
Now, I'll prescribe medicine to promote vomit.

117
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,049
And I'll use acupuncture

118
00:08:56,049 --> 00:08:57,080
to rejuvenate and protect her heart.

119
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,757
Then we can use medicine soup

120
00:08:58,757 --> 00:08:59,800
to dissipate the poison after.

121
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,960
It means there's still hope.

122
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,920
Old Madam is elderly.

123
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,600
Her body and bones aren't as strong as a youth.

124
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,640
It's not for sure. Not for sure.

125
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:19,920
Miss.

126
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,680
Please watch your own health.

127
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,920
Old Madam's hope hangs on you.

128
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,760
Don't be too startled, Madam.

129
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,920
I will do my utmost.

130
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,400
For safety measure,

131
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,840
I will go seeing what Old Madam's leftover

132
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,960
from morning and noon.

133
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,680
I'll have someone go with you. Okay.

134
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,240
My courtesy to you.

135
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,000
Alright.

136
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,960
Xiaotao.

137
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,200
How many doors are there in Sheng Manor?

138
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,440
Do you know?

139
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,600
I know.

140
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,280
Front gate, back gate,

141
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,560
side gate by front gate,

142
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,040
side gate on the west side for carriage and horse.

143
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,039
And a small gate in the backyard

144
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:11,150
by the garden and pond.

145
00:10:11,975 --> 00:10:13,840
There are two dog holes in the east garden too.

146
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,880
Take my badge.

147
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,720
Go to our manor

148
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,800
and find Sir Second Tu and his group.

149
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,000
Have them come to this yard,

150
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,040
and shut it from inside.

151
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,000
No person can leave.

152
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,000
Yes.

153
00:10:54,975 --> 00:10:56,480
Those bastards!

154
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,200
Sixth Miss.

155
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,760
Sixth Miss.

156
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,600
Sixth Miss, what does this mean?

157
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,400
Disallowed in and out.

158
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,120
And beating?

159
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,600
His Lordship has to go to royal court session.

160
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,880
Mother Liu from Big Madam's room.

161
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:35,920
Take this.

162
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,520
I know.

163
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,880
But where's Sixth Miss?

164
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,000
Sixth Miss.

165
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,960
Last night,

166
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,120
a bunch of scary hooligans came to our yard.

167
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,480
They've put a seize around our hall.

168
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,640
Earlier you said my father has to go to court?

169
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,240
Yes!

170
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,600
Then it means my father rested at Big Madam's.

171
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,560
Lately the master is always at my big madam's.

172
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,575
I'll go with you.

173
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,680
You!

174
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,240
What the hell are you doing?

175
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,823
You had people circle tight our manor

176
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:38,640
to disallow access?

177
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,160
And whoever is slightly unwilling is beaten?

178
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,320
If this news gets out,

179
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,280
how can our Sheng House place our footing outside?

180
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,600
My own daughter has the house surrounded.

181
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,440
What a bizarre happening!

182
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,320
You still care about your face right now?

183
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,880
I have to go to royal court.

184
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,625
Didn't you say yesterday it's alright

185
00:14:58,625 --> 00:14:59,920
to call in for one day of absence?

186
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,480
Father, do not worry.

187
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,000
I've already sent someone to bid your absence.

188
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,480
Saying your elderly mother is ill at home

189
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,040
and you are too weary-stricken

190
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,280
thus staying home to serve her.

191
00:15:11,175 --> 00:15:12,360
Father is always so diligent

192
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,680
and you've never been absent.

193
00:15:14,075 --> 00:15:15,400
If this gets out,

194
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,160
people will only say you are so filial

195
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,325
and have devoted to your mother

196
00:15:18,325 --> 00:15:19,440
and you have such a pure and kind spirit.

197
00:15:19,725 --> 00:15:20,920
For your reputation as an official,

198
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,430
it's quite beneficial.

199
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,400
That's actually pretty good too.

200
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,560
But you've got the entire house surrounded.

201
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,960
What are you trying to do exactly?

202
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,800
To prevent anyone from leaking in and out news here.

203
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,200
What do you mean leaking news?

204
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,800
Poison.

205
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,400
What?

206
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:45,880
That . . .

207
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,600
what nonsense are you spewing?

208
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,760
You mean Old Madam?

209
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,600
How can that be?

210
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,920
This family?

211
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,320
We're all just family

212
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,275
so how is that possible?

213
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,560
There's poison here?

214
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,760
Arsenic?

215
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:20,560
Not arsenic .

216
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,360
That's what I said.

217
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,280
It's clearly...

218
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,160
Clearly what?

219
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,720
Clearly she's ill.

220
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:29,880
She's ill.

221
00:16:33,775 --> 00:16:35,760
The sprout of the white nut is poisonous.

222
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,520
Press the juice of the sprout

223
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,480
to an extract and add to the cake.

224
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,680
But Heaven has eyes.

225
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,536
This cake is so sweet

226
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:45,800
so Grandmother only ate half of it.

227
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:46,920
Imperial Physician said

228
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,880
if she had consumed all these,

229
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,920
Grandmother would be in Palace of hell now.

230
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,920
Palace of hell?

231
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,320
The most amusing part is that yesterday at noon,

232
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,080
Big Madam's servants

233
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,520
went to Shuoan Hall to ask for the leftovers.

234
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Saying Big Nephew wanted to eat it .

235
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,480
All thanks to

236
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,350
Mother Fang who thought

237
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,360
Grandmother ate too little of it.

238
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,575
And she was afraid she might

239
00:17:09,575 --> 00:17:10,280
want to eat it again later

240
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,320
so she lied and said it was all gone.

241
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,440
Hence we have these saved.

242
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,800
What a good scheme and calculation.

243
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,100
You...

244
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,240
why are you looking at me like that?

245
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,160
Why are you looking at me like that too?

246
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,240
So many people praised you.

247
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,240
Saying you had someone go before daylight

248
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,560
to go and buy cakes for Old Madam.

249
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,560
What are you trying to push off now?

250
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,760
Speak!

251
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,760
It's...

252
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,720
just a few cakes.

253
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,440
And you want to nail my crime?

254
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,520
Not so easy!

255
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,560
Who knows if it's because

256
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,960
Old Madam's close servants have some bad intention.

257
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,840
To scheme Old Madam.

258
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,000
You idiot!

259
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,450
Shuoan Hall's people have served her for decades.

260
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:09,720
Why would they poison her?

261
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,080
Who knows if it's because Old Madam

262
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,040
might seem sweet but a bitter heart in reality.

263
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,240
And she's secretly very harsh to the servants

264
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,320
and they harbor grudge?

265
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,920
Or that imperial physician

266
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,520
can't figure out the illness

267
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,100
so he's fibbing nonsense.

268
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,240
That's fine then.

269
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,600
We live in the capital.

270
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,000
We make our living in the imperial city.

271
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,320
We can hire more imperial physicians

272
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,320
to come and take a look.

273
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,960
To see if Grandmother is poisoned

274
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,320
or sick.

275
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,080
No.

276
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,800
This is an ugly matter.

277
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,960
Yesterday you had that imperial physician come

278
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,200
and now that I think about it, that was reckless.

279
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,000
If it gets out,

280
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,520
what face will our Sheng House have?

281
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,480
You can't let more people know now.

282
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,000
Father, be assured.

283
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,377
This imperial physician

284
00:18:52,377 --> 00:18:53,440
has managed all sorts of events.

285
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,640
His lips are tight.

286
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,720
It wasn't my idea to hire other physicians actually.

287
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,130
It was because Big Madam

288
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,760
doesn't trust this physician.

289
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,650
You still won't acknowledge your wrongness?

290
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,560
She is just elderly.

291
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,680
She craved it and ate sprouted white nut

292
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,760
and she's ill.

293
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,600
You just take a few cakes here

294
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,600
and accuse me?

295
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,520
You want me to acknowledge it?

296
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,650
Over my death!

297
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,040
Sheng Hong,

298
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,543
you two father and daughter

299
00:19:23,543 --> 00:19:25,200
think my maiden home is all dead?

300
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,840
This.

301
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,800
Big Madam,

302
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,600
you needn't to seek death here.

303
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:31,080
If you think my father

304
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,840
and I are speaking unfairly,

305
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,880
we can go to public court

306
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,280
and have the magistrate judge.

307
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,360
then we will have the conclusion.

308
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,960
You deadbeat daughter!

309
00:19:39,275 --> 00:19:39,920
You don't care about reputation

310
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,200
but Sheng House still does!

311
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,080
Let me tell you.

312
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,000
If you want to pierce this matter out,

313
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,880
I will beat you to death.

314
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,720
If you really don't want this matter to get big,

315
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,080
then may you please persuade Big Madam.

316
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,376
You...

317
00:19:51,376 --> 00:19:52,800
Or else, my accusation letter is going all the way

318
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,000
to the government office.

319
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,520
Or else,

320
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,280
Father,

321
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,840
you can hide both Grandmother and evidence.

322
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,200
So I have nothing I can accuse of.

323
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,700
You dare? You dare?

324
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,560
Good child,

325
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,480
I know

326
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,520
you want to vent for your grandmother.

327
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,200
I understand your intention

328
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,040
but we are all one blood kin.

329
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,800
Why should we blow this so stiff?

330
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,880
We'll shut the door and discuss gradually, alright?

331
00:20:27,265 --> 00:20:28,225
Once we find the truth,

332
00:20:28,225 --> 00:20:29,160
I will not indulge!

333
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,000
All blood kin?

334
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,600
Father.

335
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,520
In this manor, everyone's a kin or a family.

336
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,240
Except only Grandmother!

337
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,120
Father.

338
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,080
You and I are father and daughter by blood.

339
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,560
My siblings and I are blood relations.

340
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,760
Big Madam and Sister-in-law

341
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,280
birthed Sheng blood offsprings.

342
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,640
But Grandmother?

343
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,800
She has no blood relative.

344
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,120
You are not her biological son.

345
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,160
Big Sister and Big Brother

346
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,250
and the rest of us.

347
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,520
None is her blood.

348
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,280
Big Madam has her maiden home as her backer.

349
00:21:05,825 --> 00:21:06,760
But what about Grandmother?

350
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,760
Back then, for your future's sake,

351
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,080
Grandmother wouldn't let the maiden home

352
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,240
marry their illegitimate daughter over.

353
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,640
She was loathed

354
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,080
and berated by her maiden home.

355
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,960
She cut off ties with the marquis manor for us!

356
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,680
The one who use poison.

357
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,400
They already counted on that.

358
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,800
So you would think, Father.

359
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,080
"Yes,

360
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,200
our Sheng House is so prominent now.

361
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,100
How can we let such a petty matter.

362
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,840
Bring havoc? All right?

363
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,040
How can you slap the marchioness?

364
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,720
You unfiliial rebel!

365
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,920
I will slap you when I want!

366
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,720
Last night,

367
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,400
I had this yard completely shut.

368
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,480
What did you think I did that for?

369
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,600
You do whatever you want.

370
00:22:01,525 --> 00:22:02,705
Have you thought of the consequence?

371
00:22:04,202 --> 00:22:05,080
What consequence?

372
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,680
It's just your reputation, isn't it?

373
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,560
For this reputation of yours.

374
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,600
Same as when my mother died.

375
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,800
What?

376
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,150
So now, you try to make this matter

377
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,225
looks less serious

378
00:22:15,225 --> 00:22:16,240
and then brush the small into nothing?

379
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,120
This daughter I've raised is so skilled!

380
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,560
Slandering your own father!

381
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,680
Let me tell you,

382
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,480
from now on,

383
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,800
I don't have a daughter like you!

384
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,160
I already thought it to the clear!

385
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,280
From now on,

386
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,560
even if you don't acknowledge me,

387
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,280
even if I offend the whole family completely,

388
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,800
even if I never have a maiden home to lean back on.

389
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,375
What glory and prestige?

390
00:22:40,775 --> 00:22:41,960
What confer of title and nobility?

391
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,360
I don't want any of that!

392
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,640
I just want fairness.

393
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,160
I only beg for justice for Grandmother!

394
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,240
She's crazy.

395
00:22:52,725 --> 00:22:54,045
Crazy.

396
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,640
There are two paths now.

397
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,480
Either Big Madam

398
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,320
you hurry and explain this clearly.

399
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,000
Or I will go strike the drum

400
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,360
and cry my grievance at Keifeng Precinct.

401
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,880
You guys figure it out!

402
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,400
Husband.

403
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,680
We're in this plot now.

404
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,160
We don't have another route.

405
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,560
If you still don't fess the truth,

406
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,560
I can only hand you the divorce papers.

407
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,880
Worst case I offend the Wang House

408
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,240
and I never acquaint them again.

409
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:01,880
You!

410
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,280
You're crazy.

411
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,800
Crazy!

412
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,200
Wild!

413
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,880
You dare to accuse

414
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,160
and slander your elder?

415
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,650
Go and tell His Majesty.

416
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,960
Tell him I'm rebellious to my elder.

417
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,040
If you can walk out of here.

418
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,600
Go get paper and ink.

419
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,800
I'll write the repudiating letter now.

420
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,520
Husband.

421
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,200
Husband,

422
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,075
my Wang House has always been good to you.

423
00:24:29,075 --> 00:24:29,600
Husband!

424
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,200
Husband, you can't treat me this way.

425
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,440
Let me tell you!

426
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,840
Imperial Physician already has the diagnose.

427
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,600
That cake has poison

428
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,760
and you bought them!

429
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,560
Just those three alone.

430
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,360
The brat has your life in her palm.

431
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,750
What's Wang House?

432
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,440
You scheme and harm your mother-in-law.

433
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,675
Even if you're the princess,

434
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,040
I will still divorce you!

435
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,080
I...

436
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,000
my father's suited for the imperial shrine!

437
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,760
You dare to divorce me?!

438
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,000
Big Madam!

439
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,360
Stop being stubborn!

440
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,520
Big Madam!

441
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,760
If you still don't say the truth,

442
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,700
Young Master Bai

443
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,080
and the other two misses will get dragged into this.

444
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,120
If something happens to you,

445
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,800
this will make the two misses

446
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,080
unable to make any footing in their husband's family.

447
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,240
Young Master Bai is currently

448
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,560
having a great political career!

449
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,080
I almost forgot about you, Nanny Liu.

450
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,800
You are the trusted aide of Big Madam.

451
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,579
For such an important matter,

452
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:39,600
how could you not be involved?

453
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,880
When Old Madam instructed

454
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,800
not to let Madam Kang come to our house again,

455
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,480
as a servant,

456
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,640
I also felt that it was very right.

457
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,680
I initially came from the House of Wang,

458
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,920
but I must say something today.

459
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,120
This eldest sister of Big Madam is getting worse.

460
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,800
I also frequently urge Big Madam

461
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,000
to stop having any interaction with her.

462
00:26:05,425 --> 00:26:06,360
But Big Madam,

463
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,600
in consideration of their sibling relationship,

464
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,160
just won't listen.

465
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,160
Every time when she talked with her,

466
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,680
she would send me out.

467
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,360
It then means that

468
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:20,600
you don't know anything.

469
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,520
While listening outside the window earlier,

470
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,720
I could guess it more or less.

471
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,640
Don't Miss just have some suspicion,

472
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,680
that's why you insist on asking Big Madam

473
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,480
to admit it?

474
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,720
Or else, just with what the royal physician said,

475
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,040
and this plate of snacks,

476
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,760
you would have a fit since last night

477
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,600
and would be discussing on her punishment today,

478
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,600
not just forcing her to confess.

479
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,225
In this whole house,

480
00:26:45,225 --> 00:26:46,560
you're the only sensible person.

481
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,040
I'm quite impressed.

482
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,550
The House of Wang really gave it a lot of thought

483
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,920
to send you over here.

484
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,520
Sixth Miss,

485
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,680
I've attended to Big Madam since she was young.

486
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:03,280
I know her personality the most.

487
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,360
Although she's a bit impatient,

488
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,960
she's a very straightforward person.

489
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,600
How could she have thought of some gingko or juice,

490
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,440
such sinister methods of scheming?!

491
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,600
Miss,

492
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,600
isn't it also because you are doubtful of this

493
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,600
that's why you kept asking Big Madam

494
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,640
to tell the truth?

495
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,920
What she said is true too.

496
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,875
This main wife of mine

497
00:27:29,875 --> 00:27:31,920
would always do things in an open manner.

498
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,480
Even if she knows that

499
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,560
this gingko sprout is poisonous,

500
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,440
how can she know that the juice of its sprout

501
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,440
can be refined into a thick juice?

502
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,300
Only a very meticulous person

503
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,120
Miss!

504
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,120
Miss!

505
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,040
I've followed you for decades,

506
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,240
since I was little!

507
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,960
When have I not whole-heartedly helped

508
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,920
and covered for you?!

509
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,160
Say it!

510
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,040
She's trying to frame you to death here!

511
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,800
Just say it!

512
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,880
Not for anyone else,

513
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,680
just for our young master and misses!

514
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,760
It's that...

515
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,360
legitimate eldest sister of mine, Madam Kang.

516
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,400
She...

517
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,480
told me that I was being controlled

518
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,520
by Old Madam so tightly.

519
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,650
Getting scolded

520
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,800
or punished by her at the slightest pretext.

521
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:42,440
Now,

522
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,400
I even lost the right to manage my house.

523
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,960
Even my daughter-in-law can step on my face.

524
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,280
That I've really lived a good-for-nothing life.

525
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,240
But

526
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,920
Old Madam has such healthy body.

527
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,400
Don't know for how long I still must bear everything.

528
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:04,880
Hence...

529
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,480
Hence.

530
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,840
Hence,

531
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,760
you and your older sister colluded

532
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,880
to poison Old Madam to death?!

533
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,080
I won't!

534
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,120
I dare not!

535
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:12,960
I really don't dare!

536
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:13,840
I...

537
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,440
She said...

538
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,240
As long as Old Madam's health would weaken a little,

539
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,080
getting sick every so often,

540
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,575
had no energy to care about this or that,

541
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,240
I could then be the master of this household.

542
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,120
Muddle.

543
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,120
You're really muddle!

544
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,160
You're so stupid!

545
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,720
My older sister said that fruit is safe.

546
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,440
Didn't the royal physician also said last night that

547
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,680
her condition had been stabilized?

548
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,320
How would I know?

549
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,480
Main Mother,

550
00:29:48,775 --> 00:29:49,880
you're so muddled.

551
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,160
Have you thought about

552
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,400
Brother Changbai's son?

553
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,880
Your own grandson?

554
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,520
He would frequently

555
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,720
go to grandmother's place to play.

556
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,120
If grandmother dotes him

557
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,440
and really shared a bite for him to eat,

558
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:04,350
could Quan'er still be alive now?

559
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,840
She's my biological sister.

560
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,440
She won't do that...

561
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,280
That is your own grandson

562
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,520
and not hers!

563
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,560
Why would she care?!

564
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,476
Even if something bad

565
00:30:20,476 --> 00:30:21,320
did happen to Young Master Quan,

566
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,440
can you confront her?

567
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,760
Only she gets to manipulate you!

568
00:30:27,875 --> 00:30:29,240
She's just waiting for grandmother to die

569
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,088
and you to grab hold of the power

570
00:30:30,088 --> 00:30:30,880
to run this household.

571
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,054
With she knowing your secret

572
00:30:33,054 --> 00:30:34,040
of killing your mother-in-law,

573
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,480
how could you refuse whatever she asks,

574
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,200
refuse whatever she wants you to do?

575
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,600
If you can't do it,

576
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,080
she'll force you to ask Brother Changbai to do it.

577
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,560
For things you can't give her,

578
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,200
she'll ask you to ask it from Sister Hualan.

579
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,240
By then,

580
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,440
won't you and our House of Sheng

581
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,440
just casually get manipulated by her like that?

582
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,760
Shameless!

583
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,240
Who are you?

584
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,160
Help!

585
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,000
Somebody!

586
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,080
Somebody!

587
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,040
Get lost!

588
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,080
Sir Second Tu?

589
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,775
This woman wants to escape through the dog hole.

590
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,280
What are you doing?

591
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,200
Let go of me!

592
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,240
Drag her in for Miss to see.

593
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,960
Why are you going out?

594
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,600
You...

595
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,480
You are working for my sister?!

596
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,480
I'm innocent, Big Madam.

597
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,720
It's because I have an urgent matter at home,

598
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,440
that's why, I wanted to leave.

599
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,560
What urgent matter?

600
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,120
My mother is sick, Master.

601
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,680
I...

602
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,200
You're currently agitated because Old Madam is sick.

603
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,000
I am also anxious that my mother is sick!

604
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,680
Bullshit!

605
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,600
Your mother has died for 2 years.

606
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,720
I even asked Nanny Liu to give you 5 taels of silver

607
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,520
as burial money.

608
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,840
It's...godmother!

609
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,680
A godmother is still a mother, Big Madam!

610
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,000
You're still not telling the truth?!

611
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,360
If you still don't say the truth,

612
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,480
I'll look for someone to drag you out

613
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,440
and cane you to death!

614
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,320
What look for someone?

615
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,525
This can't get out.

616
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,200
I don't have that much idle time.

617
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,207
Grandmother must have her

618
00:32:16,207 --> 00:32:17,160
second bowl of medicine now.

619
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,680
Since father is afraid of alarming other people,

620
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,040
Sir Second Tu.

621
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,120
Here!

622
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,800
She doesn't want to tell the truth.

623
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,320
May Sir Second Tu think of a way.

624
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,440
You...

625
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,650
I'll say it!

626
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:37,000
I'll say it!

627
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,080
It's Madam Kang.

628
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:38,960
It's her.

629
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,960
She gave me some more silver

630
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,800
so I will tell her what's happening in this manor.

631
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,200
A few days ago,

632
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,680
she came here to see her little sister

633
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,680
and chatted for a while.

634
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,520
Before going back, she gave me a few more,

635
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,560
asking me to immediately report back to her

636
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,040
if there were any happenings here!

637
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,600
Ungrateful bitch!

638
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,720
Sir Second Tu,

639
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,280
guard her well.

640
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,280
Don't let anyone approach her

641
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,560
and don't lose her.

642
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,520
Yes.

643
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,760
Big Madam! Big Madam!

644
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:30,255
Father,

645
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,680
do you now know why

646
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,080
I sealed the manor?

647
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,700
If we did this right on the scene yesterday,

648
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,480
then it's a spy in our house colluding

649
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,000
with an evil outsider.

650
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,040
But since this matter

651
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,640
was the doing of that Kang woman,

652
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,640
stop blaming your legitimate mother already, okay?

653
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,480
Yes,

654
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,320
I really thought that

655
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,800
Old Madam would only be sick for a few days.

656
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,960
Father,

657
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,080
have you thought about what to do next?

658
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,680
Next?

659
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,840
Of course,

660
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,924
it's to trouble the royal physician

661
00:34:04,924 --> 00:34:05,800
to exert more effort

662
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,720
in nursing Old Madam.

663
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,607
Since father hasn't thought about

664
00:34:09,607 --> 00:34:10,720
what we should do next,

665
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,440
I will decide for you.

666
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:14,760
Nanny Liu,

667
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,480
thank you for your help this time.

668
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,400
Good thing, Caihuai was apprehended

669
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,600
and she didn't foil the situation.

670
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,440
May I trouble you to go to the Kang Manor

671
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,600
and invite maternal aunt here.

672
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,040
That troublemaker Kang,

673
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,400
why must we still invite her here?!

674
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,760
Just pretend to be frightened

675
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,200
and in panic.

676
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,040
Tell her that grandmother has struggled for a night

677
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,920
and is now gasping her last breath.

678
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,120
Big Madam is so scared.

679
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,840
She's especially asking maternal aunt to come over

680
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:43,840
and help her in coming up with ideas,

681
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:44,840
to extend some helping hand.

682
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:45,960
This...

683
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
She caused all this trouble.

684
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,480
How could she be willing to come?

685
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,200
Why wouldn't she?

686
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,400
It wasn't easy for her

687
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,800
to finally do this pleasurable thing.

688
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,040
How can she endure it?

689
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,360
Just quickly go.

690
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,080
Or else, this line won't be of any use soon.

691
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:02,760
Yes.

692
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:21,650
You can't go out right now. You can't go out.

693
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,175
Why to deceive her?

694
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,880
We can just directly go to their Kang Manor

695
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,760
and argue with them.

696
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,200
If this matter is true,

697
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,125
will that House of Kang,

698
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,800
no, the House of Wang,

699
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,000
be willing to hand her over?

700
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,440
I'm sure father won't dare escalate this

701
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,440
to the local officials

702
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,960
and ask for an open and fair punishment.

703
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,480
By then,

704
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,720
we can't really drag our witness

705
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,640
and fight into their house, right?

706
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:53,880
Father,

707
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,160
it wasn't easy for our family to reach our status now.

708
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,040
It's all thanks to the blessings of our ancestors.

709
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,275
Father has been promoted to a fourth-rank official.

710
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:03,036
My sisters have all been

711
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:04,000
married off to good families too.

712
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,999
Second Brother Changbai

713
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:07,160
has such bright political future ahead.

714
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,375
Since Third Brother

715
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:09,200
mended his ways and became focused,

716
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,920
he surely will pass the civil examination soon.

717
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,880
With our Sheng Family

718
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,960
having such good future potential,

719
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:16,320
must we get destroyed in the hands of

720
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,680
that crazy Maternal Aunt Kang?

721
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,920
What you said was right.

722
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,000
It took great pains for our family to finally

723
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,280
have such achievement and status.

724
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,640
It mustn't just go down the drain.

725
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,640
Hence,

726
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,640
we must make her come here.

727
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,320
Have her be under our control.

728
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,120
No matter how she should be dealt with,

729
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,480
we get to have the final say.

730
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,800
What?

731
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,680
How else do you want to deal with her?

732
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,050
Are you planning to have her life?

733
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:43,240
Father, don't worry.

734
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,000
I won't cause you trouble.

735
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:47,200
I'll bring her out before killing her.

736
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,440
What?

737
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,280
You...

738
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,920
You were once so obedient and docile.

739
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,800
How come your speech is full of fighting

740
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,160
and killing now?

741
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,680
You're like Yaksha .

742
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,240
That's right.

743
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,680
Why is that?

744
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,000
My god.

745
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,920
Can we really get justice for Old Madam?

746
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,240
In this world, between people,

747
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,520
it's always a test of

748
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,760
who's more willing to sacrifice it all.

749
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,440
Father. Main Mother.

750
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,920
House of Kang. House of Wang.

751
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,480
None of them is willing to give it their all.

752
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,720
But I dare to.

753
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,360
Earlier, Old Madam vomited again.

754
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,775
It was really such a heartache to watch.

755
00:37:49,125 --> 00:37:50,200
But after vomiting,

756
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,720
she was able to lie down more comfortably

757
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,040
and her breath became more normal.

758
00:37:55,075 --> 00:37:56,050
Has she woken up yet?

759
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,040
Not yet.

760
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,760
Once the royal physician comes,

761
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,240
serve him well.

762
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,560
Miss, don't worry.

763
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,680
We all know what to do.

764
00:38:19,325 --> 00:38:20,360
Sixth Miss,

765
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,160
Madam Kang went to Big Madam's room alone.

766
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,920
What did you tell her?

767
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,040
I told her that Big Madam wants

768
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,925
to confide and discuss things with her.

769
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,775
That even I mustn't enter the room.

770
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:36,920
Nanny Liu,

771
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,375
thank you.

772
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,080
You sincerely care for her.

773
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,560
I dare not receive your praises.

774
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,360
I'm just doing my job to my utmost.

775
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,160
The people of Madam Kang

776
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,200
have already been detained

777
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,474
and being watched by the older servants

778
00:38:50,474 --> 00:38:50,960
of the main house.

779
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,400
There must be quite a number of them.

780
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,480
You can really predict things.

781
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,480
There are four older servants

782
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,320
that came with her this time.

783
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,240
By the gates, there are still 6 male servants.

784
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,520
Among these four older servants,

785
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,280
two are close maid attendants from

786
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,960
the House of Wang that were part of her dowry.

787
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,160
And the other two

788
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,200
are her trusted steward maids.

789
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,720
What's wrong?

790
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,400
I just noticed that

791
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,520
Nanny Qi didn't come.

792
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,400
Is she important?

793
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,000
Although Nanny Qi is old,

794
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,640
she's the most trusted maidservant of Madam Kang.

795
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,565
Which means that

796
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:29,800
the most important person didn't come,

797
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,920
while all other who are not important are here.

798
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,800
This is interesting then.

799
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,320
Nanny Liu,

800
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,080
do one more thing for me.

801
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:54,860
Today, no people can be seen

802
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,600
in front and at the back of the house.

803
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,840
It shows that you've really put your heart into this.

804
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,560
We've guarded this place so tightly.

805
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,040
Only Madam Kang was able

806
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,120
to enter the courtyard of Big Madam earlier.

807
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,040
We were instructed not to follow.

808
00:40:08,125 --> 00:40:09,160
You both are quick-witted.

809
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,920
The two madams indeed have things to talk about.

810
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,120
But don't imitate those discontent servants,

811
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:16,360
who would try to listen for a bit and in the end,

812
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,640
harm themselves.

813
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,450
Yes. Yes.

814
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,520
Is your heart black?!

815
00:40:31,925 --> 00:40:34,160
That is one life!

816
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,400
It was you who kept crying to me every day

817
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,400
You told me your mother-in-law is oppressing you

818
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,640
and you can't breathe anymore.

819
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,560
She even had you kneel by her door.

820
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,800
Now,

821
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,960
you're pretending to be filial?

822
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,150
I...only want...

823
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,640
her to be sick for a few days.

824
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,920
You want to kill my mother-in-law

825
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,800
and even frame me.

826
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,560
You're so heartless!

827
00:40:57,825 --> 00:40:59,080
What are you talking about?

828
00:41:03,375 --> 00:41:04,360
Let me tell you.

829
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,360
You're the one who placed the poison.

830
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,360
My hands are very clean.

831
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,640
Now...

832
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,520
no one can escape.

833
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,200
What nonsense are you saying?

834
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,040
She's saying that

835
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,120
since you've fallen into my hands,

836
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,240
don't think of clearing yourself from this.

837
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,480
Why are you here?

838
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,320
Quickly get out.

839
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,280
Your legitimate mother and I have things to discuss.

840
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,680
Maternal Aunt, you are so capable.

841
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,440
How did you know about

842
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,840
the juice of ginkgo?

843
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,120
What nonsense is this child spouting?

844
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,840
You are confusing me.

845
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:58,600
It's okay.

846
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,200
Once I'm done interrogating,

847
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,920
you won't be confused anymore.

848
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,440
Interrogate?

849
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,280
You even dare to interrogate me?

850
00:42:13,951 --> 00:42:15,400
illegitimate daughter of yours.

851
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,560
She even wants to interrogate me.

852
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:21,840
You really think you can get out of this room today?

853
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,400
You dare?!

854
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,440
Bring her in!

855
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,520
Sixth Miss,

856
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,640
it's her.

857
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:43,840
It's her.

858
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,640
She told me that

859
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,280
Big Madam will only favor Nanny Liu,

860
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,320
hence, I can never get promoted.

861
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,000
That's why,

862
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,880
she gave me some money to be her spy.

863
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,840
She had me tell her everything about our manor.

864
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:06,720
Big Madam...

865
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,760
I just couldn't accept

866
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,080
how I'm unable to be better than Nanny Liu.

867
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:14,880
My heart got blinded by pig's oil,

868
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,120
so I agreed to her.

869
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,080
Big Madam,

870
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,080
in consideration of how I've taken care of you,

871
00:43:21,475 --> 00:43:23,760
please forgive me!

872
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,950
You bitch!

873
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:27,080
Other than Nanny Liu

874
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,000
who came with me as my dowry,

875
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:28,840
among all the servants in this courtyard,

876
00:43:29,275 --> 00:43:30,760
I treated you the best!

877
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,600
You are so ungrateful!

878
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,320
You dare destroy me?!

879
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,400
This lowly servant is spouting nonsense!

880
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,280
She's slandering me.

881
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,800
Is everything prepared?

882
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:44,440
Yes.

883
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,240
Take this madam out first.

884
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,880
Keep watching of her and searching her body.

885
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,800
Don't let her hurt herself.

886
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,040
What are you doing?

887
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:56,880
Let go of me!

888
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,560
I'm your legitimate eldest sister after all.

889
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,240
You dare let that bitch treat me like this?

890
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,600
You were even denying it earlier

891
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,600
and saying that everything was my doing.

892
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,560
Now, you've thought about how we are siblings?

893
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,320
You...

894
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,120
I'm a wife of an official.

895
00:44:12,925 --> 00:44:14,280
Let's see who dares touch me.

896
00:44:15,425 --> 00:44:16,440
These two senior servants

897
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,960
were from the manor of the rebel prince.

898
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:21,680
They've seen people of your status a lot.

899
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,240
Why won't they dare touch you?

900
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,640
You bitch! You...

901
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,200
Move!

902
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:25,840
You!

903
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,600
My husband and maternal family are both...

904
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:29,800
Let go of me!

905
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,120
Let go of me!

906
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,560
I'm an official's wife.
