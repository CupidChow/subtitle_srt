00:00:55,119 --> 00:01:00,119
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:03,080
Episode 13

3
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,680
Did you say that?

4
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,319
Did you really say that!

5
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,239
What

6
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,720
did I say?

7
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,800
I once said the Emperor

8
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,279
was too harsh with Yang Wuduan

9
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:22,319
and it ruined his entire life.

10
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,360
You heard it from me,

11
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,440
and you turned around and went to tattle to the Emperor!

12
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:28,400
How could I have an older brother like you in this world?

13
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,519
I, I, this...

14
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:32,160
Release your older brother!

15
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,919
Release him!

16
00:01:35,279 --> 00:01:36,919
Speak! Why did you harm me?

17
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,279
I swear that nothing like this happened.

18
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,319
Let go.

19
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:41,919
Bastard!

20
00:01:42,279 --> 00:01:43,879
You went to the brothels and blabbed your mouth off

21
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:45,760
and said those unfilial words.

22
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:47,160
You still want to blame your older brother?

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,440
I didn't say anything about this out there.

24
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:50,440
I said it

25
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,279
when I was studying in the study room!

26
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,639
At that time,

27
00:01:53,559 --> 00:01:54,519
I wasn't even twelve years old yet.

28
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,480
Seeing how nice your writing was,

29
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,279
I practiced with you every day.

30
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,319
When I said this,

31
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,160
no one else was there!

32
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,000
It wasn't me.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,919
It really wasn't me!

34
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,800
Second Uncle, show some sympathy!

35
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,480
Father, save me!

36
00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:09,240
Since young, my husband has been weak and always sick.

37
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,440
He can't even go on the path of an Imperial exam for a post.

38
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,679
Has he ever fought with you for anything?

39
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,160
How will it benefit him

40
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,240
if he frames you, Second Uncle?

41
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,440
Let go of your hand.

42
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,800
Let go!

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,759
Lord.

44
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,199
I find it very strange too

45
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,880
as to why you

46
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,880
keep framing me.

47
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:36,320
Since young until now,

48
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,279
you made life difficult for me.

49
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,039
You deliberately fell,

50
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,000
and said that I pushed you.

51
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:43,639
When you had a fever,

52
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:44,679
you said that I scared you!

53
00:02:45,559 --> 00:02:46,399
When I was five,

54
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,559
you took Father's finger guard

55
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,960
and said that I stole it!

56
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,919
My father,

57
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,080
without differentiating what's right and wrong,

58
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:55,919
would always beat me.

59
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,639
Why didn't everyone think about

60
00:02:59,119 --> 00:02:59,880
why you, my own older brother,

61
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:01,360
wanted to

62
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,039
harm me!

63
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:04,320
You, what are you talking about?

64
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,919
Shut up.

65
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:07,479
This is basically not

66
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,559
your older brother's issue.

67
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,919
Even if he said it,

68
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,080
he has to have something to talk about.

69
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,679
If you hadn't

70
00:03:13,679 --> 00:03:14,440
spewed out such wild talk,

71
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,240
even if he wanted to go

72
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,559
and spread it outside eight li around,

73
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,399
he would still need something to speak of.

74
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,759
So, this is how Father thinks.

75
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,199
This is really how Father thinks.

76
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,800
You don't need to

77
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,600
show me how you have suffered,

78
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,039
what's your fault,

79
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,479
have you ever

80
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,720
admitted it?

81
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,240
You always push it to your older brother

82
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,000
or your cousins.

83
00:03:47,839 --> 00:03:49,479
It's always their mess they've caused.

84
00:03:49,839 --> 00:03:51,279
But you are

85
00:03:51,279 --> 00:03:52,160
so tall,

86
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,600
and have never created any disasters?

87
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,679
Fine.

88
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,080
I understand now.

89
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,360
I understand everything now.

90
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,880
Even if my body is covered with mouths,

91
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:15,479
I won't be able to go up against your prejudice.

92
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,399
Lord.

93
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,359
Enough, son.

94
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,600
For the past few days

95
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,160
you have been drowning your sorrows with wine.

96
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,640
I know

97
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:04,359
you are very sad

98
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:05,320
and haven't been talking much

99
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:07,600
but

100
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:10,600
you should have a limit too.

101
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,040
If you continue this way

102
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,079
you will have a hard time with your life.

103
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,279
Nanny,

104
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,239
I won't get drunk again.

105
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:24,239
How should I explain

106
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:25,760
to Man'er and the children?

107
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,079
What's there to explain?

108
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,119
Failing in an examination is a common thing.

109
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,000
It's not a big deal.

110
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,040
You can take the examination again.

111
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,440
I won't be able to do it again.

112
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:38,880
It was the Emperor

113
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,760
who personally removed my name.

114
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,519
He even said

115
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,959
I could only take the examination again

116
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:48,959
when I'm fifty years old.

117
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:51,799
I fear

118
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:54,359
I will never have any future in this lifetime.

119
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,720
What? This

120
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,880
Then ask your father

121
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,000
to plead with the Emperor.

122
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:24,440
Just say that you were young and didn't know anything.

123
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,279
It's useless.

124
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,279
My father is sure that it's my fault.

125
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:37,000
He was eager to say that it was my fault.

126
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,839
I'm not accomplished.

127
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,279
It seems like Mother deserved to die.

128
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:46,440
It also seems that

129
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,160
I'm not fit to be the main heir of this marquis house.

130
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,679
Everyone in that

131
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:53,279
manor believes their own lies.

132
00:06:54,679 --> 00:06:55,920
They all

133
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,359
think by doing so,

134
00:06:58,679 --> 00:06:59,839
they can forget

135
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,160
the reality that they married

136
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,799
my mother because of money.

137
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,440
Mother, I'm thirsty.

138
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,720
Wait here.

139
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,440
Your father can't be an official.

140
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,839
Official?

141
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,320
He can't be an official.

142
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,119
The Marquis

143
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:41,119
doesn't like him.

144
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:44,160
In the future, he wants to be a separate family from him.

145
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,640
I'm afraid

146
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,440
he won't have a stable life anymore.

147
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:51,920
Now that it has come to this,

148
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,480
I can only

149
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,239
take a chance again.

150
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:58,839
Get up.

151
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,040
Where's the lock?

152
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,000
That's right.

153
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,640
I

154
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,399
I'm really unaccomplished.

155
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:21,359
I disappointed

156
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:22,399
my maternal grandfather and my mother.

157
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,519
They hoped that I would win top marks

158
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,839
in the Imperial examination

159
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,600
and bring honor to our Bai family's name.

160
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:35,080
But I...

161
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,719
Because of a casual remark,

162
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:42,359
my future has been cut off.

163
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,400
I'm as the Gu family claims

164
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:51,599
I'm an unfilial son!

165
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,239
Young Master, don't say that.

166
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,840
You are wrong in thinking this way.

167
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,080
When you were born,

168
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,280
your mother told me that

169
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,760
she hoped that you would be happy and safe.

170
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,320
As for the rest,

171
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,000
she didn't

172
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,119
care at all!

173
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,200
Nanny.

174
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,640
The five of us,

175
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:24,159
Let's go to the rural area of Yangzhou

176
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:26,559
and find a place

177
00:09:27,719 --> 00:09:30,159
to live quietly

178
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,239
and in peace.

179
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,200
Okay?

180
00:09:33,359 --> 00:09:34,799
I will listen to you.

181
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,760
As long as you can live happily,

182
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:42,799
I can live any kind of life.

183
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,799
I'm going to the Marquis Manor

184
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,799
to move everything out.

185
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,880
If Marquis Manor can't tolerate me anymore,

186
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,039
I don't want to stay there any longer.

187
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,119
In the future,

188
00:10:08,119 --> 00:10:09,080
we, Rong'er and Chang'er

189
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,000
will live quietly and in peace.

190
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,440
I'm afraid

191
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,080
if you create a scene at the Marquis Manor,

192
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:32,840
they will arrest you,

193
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,479
beat and imprison you. What will we do?

194
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,559
It's still better to have a long-term plan.

195
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,440
What are you afraid of?

196
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:45,599
Those at the Marquis Manor

197
00:10:45,599 --> 00:10:46,479
can't do anything to me.

198
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,799
To add further, I have Shitou.

199
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:51,640
Shitou grew up in the canal gang.

200
00:10:51,719 --> 00:10:52,760
Skillful and talented.

201
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,559
If I don't succeed,

202
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:59,520
my family name is not Gu.

203
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,320
Find a hidden oasis,

204
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,760
and ask not the matters of the world.

205
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,039
The man farms and the woman weaves.

206
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:05,919
Isn't that divine?

207
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:11,039
Fine. Anything is good.

208
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:15,440
I only want to be with you.

209
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,159
I need to go to the Marquis Manor

210
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,320
to retrieve my late mother's items.

211
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,119
We can't

212
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,000
let news of it leak out.

213
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,559
If not,

214
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:30,520
the Marquis will never let me off.

215
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:32,919
You and Nanny can start packing up.

216
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,440
Wait for me to find a boat going to the south.

217
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,119
We will

218
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:39,719
leave then.

219
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,479
Let's go.

220
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,239
There are still some clothes and shoes in the house

221
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:14,840
which haven't been packed yet.

222
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,280
Where are you going?

223
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:18,559
Go and tidy up,

224
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,840
so the Young Master doesn't have to

225
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,719
just sit and wait after his return.

226
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,000
Candy for sale.

227
00:12:28,239 --> 00:12:32,200
Sweet and sour candy.

228
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,479
Mother,

229
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:38,559
I want candy.

230
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:41,359
Candy for sale.

231
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,159
Candy for sale.

232
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,200
Have some candy.

233
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,039
Rongjie, be good.

234
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,840
After you have packed everything,

235
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,080
I will buy candy for you.

236
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:55,880
Come.

237
00:12:56,719 --> 00:12:58,799
Play with your younger brother in the courtyard.

238
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:00,440
Be good.

239
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,400
Go now.

240
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,799
She's at minimum from a wretched upbringing,

241
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:14,280
but her chores are done so untidily.

242
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:17,119
She's so superficial.

243
00:13:17,119 --> 00:13:17,880
I really wonder

244
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,640
what he sees in her.

245
00:13:24,719 --> 00:13:26,239
Have some candy.

246
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,039
Have some candy.

247
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,760
Many different kinds of candy.

248
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,760
The candies that children love to eat.

249
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,400
Sweet candies, sour candies.

250
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:42,840
It's even sweeter than honey.

251
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,200
It's even sweeter than honey.

252
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:48,520
Candy for sale.

253
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:52,919
Candy for sale.

254
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:56,039
Candies that children love to eat.

255
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:58,840
Rongjie.

256
00:14:04,239 --> 00:14:05,239
Rongjie.

257
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,479
Where's your older sister?

258
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:16,880
You can't go out!

259
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,119
The Young Master instructed that

260
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:20,320
you can't show your face outside!

261
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:25,239
Rongjie! Rongjie!

262
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,200
Come back here!

263
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,280
Don't run. Come back.

264
00:14:34,719 --> 00:14:36,479
Rongjie! Rongjie!

265
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,119
Rongjie.

266
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,039
Rongjie, where are you?

267
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,840
Rongjie, where are you?

268
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:50,159
Rongjie!

269
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:52,039
Rongjie.

270
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,719
Rongjie, look.

271
00:15:12,599 --> 00:15:14,520
How powerful and dignified.

272
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,880
Look.

273
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,039
When you were born,

274
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:20,400
you were a member of the family of the Marquis.

275
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:22,880
A house like that,

276
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,840
one can't even imagine it for three lifetimes.

277
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,640
It's this woman.

278
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:29,200
The doorkeeper heard her saying

279
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,320
"grandmother and grandfather".

280
00:15:30,719 --> 00:15:32,919
I found it suspicious,

281
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:34,320
so I went to listen more closely,

282
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:36,840
before coming to report to you.

283
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,799
In the future, after you enter Marquis Manor,

284
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,599
you will become a precious lady of the noble house.

285
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,280
And at the time,

286
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,039
your mother here

287
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,919
will get herself a title

288
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:50,039
of proper wife and lady too.

289
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,359
Come, I will take you there.

290
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:06,320
Go and retrieve

291
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,359
what she dropped.

292
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,479
Yes.

293
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,640
Mother!

294
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,200
What are you doing?

295
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,400
Release her!

296
00:16:43,599 --> 00:16:44,440
Mother!

297
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,039
Let me go.

298
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,119
Son,

299
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:57,320
Rongjie is missing.

300
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:59,799
Manniang went after her.

301
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:01,159
Both of them are gone!

302
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,159
I was about to lock the door and go look for them.

303
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,160
Fortunately, you are back.

304
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,319
Let's go and find them now.

305
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,880
Where did they go? How long have they been gone?

306
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:11,439
I think at least a rice-cooking time.

307
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,920
A rice-cooking time.

308
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,520
She came back,

309
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,280
left again and didn't come back?

310
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:18,520
She never came back.

311
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,520
Is this retribution?

312
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,400
Stop asking.

313
00:17:20,479 --> 00:17:21,400
Let's get people

314
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,280
to look for them now!

315
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,719
No need.

316
00:17:23,719 --> 00:17:24,560
What's wrong?

317
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,920
Manniang is only a woman.

318
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:29,640
She'd come back for help

319
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,040
if she can't find the child after a couple of rounds.

320
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,119
She still hasn't been seen for such a long time.

321
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,880
I believe she's been taken.

322
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:37,319
Heavens!

323
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,599
Who dares to just

324
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:41,880
kidnap in broad daylight?

325
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,319
I fear it's even scarier than that.

326
00:18:03,719 --> 00:18:04,560
This child was born to you

327
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,040
and that vile one?

328
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
There's also a boy?

329
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,520
Yes.

330
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:20,719
Your Excellency, please don't be angry.

331
00:18:20,719 --> 00:18:21,760
It's my fault

332
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,680
I seduced Second Master,

333
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:26,119
but I'm sincere toward him.

334
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,280
I'm begging you,

335
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,599
on account of the children,

336
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:33,640
please let us have a means to live.

337
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:35,479
Means to live?

338
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:36,920
What is that?

339
00:18:39,199 --> 00:18:41,319
I'm from a humble background

340
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:42,880
and do not hope for any status.

341
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,400
As long as I can be with Second Master

342
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,640
and be a concubine,

343
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,119
see him every day

344
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:50,800
and serve him,

345
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,760
I will be fully content.

346
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,199
Dream on.

347
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:56,839
What status does he have

348
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:57,719
and what status do you have

349
00:18:58,199 --> 00:18:59,400
that you dare to even think of

350
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,640
crossing into our Marquis Manor?

351
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,640
Bringing you here already

352
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,439
makes me feel you've dirtied up

353
00:19:04,439 --> 00:19:05,599
all the tiles in this house.

354
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,800
Your Excellency, please don't be angry!

355
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,560
Your Excellency, please don't be angry!

356
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,520
Your Excellency, please don't be angry!

357
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:29,079
Kick her out

358
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:30,119
and make her stay

359
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:31,000
as far away as possible.

360
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,439
Lord, Lord.

361
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:36,239
What about the children?

362
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:37,760
Didn't she just say that

363
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,680
there is boy too?

364
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,119
They are our flesh and blood of the Gu family.

365
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,680
A whore gave birth to those children.

366
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,199
How could they be members of the Gu family?

367
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:46,400
How will we

368
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,560
explain to Second Son?

369
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:49,599
What's the matter with you?!

370
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,079
I'm an elder.

371
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:54,119
Do I still need to explain to him?

372
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:56,640
Kick them out!

373
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,239
Marquis! Marquis!

374
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:01,160
Let go of me.

375
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,319
Mother

376
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,880
Rongjie!

377
00:20:04,959 --> 00:20:06,040
Tingye!

378
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,520
Who dares to lay a finger on her!

379
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,880
You still have the cheek to come back?

380
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,439
What are you trying to do?

381
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,479
I will admit her into the family.

382
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,160
One who sings for a living.

383
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,839
She doesn't even qualify to hold your shoes for you.

384
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,400
It's even more shameless for her to be your mistress

385
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,599
and you want to accept her into your family?

386
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:33,160
Who will want to marry you in the future?

387
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:35,560
If no one wants to marry me, I won't marry.

388
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,880
Father, won't you be happier?

389
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:40,119
You don't even

390
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:41,040
care about your future,

391
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,760
but you commit these acts

392
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,959
that shame our clan?

393
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,560
In your eyes,

394
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,119
ever since I was born,

395
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,760
I was already shameful to the clan.

396
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,880
A bit more is no trouble.

397
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:53,800
Second Son.

398
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:55,920
Manniang, stop crying.

399
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,079
Don't shed

400
00:20:58,079 --> 00:20:59,000
your tears here.

401
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:01,239
Let's go.

402
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:02,000
Stop there!

403
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:03,719
Second Son.

404
00:21:03,719 --> 00:21:04,839
If you dare to step out from that door,

405
00:21:05,199 --> 00:21:06,199
I will beat you to death!

406
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,439
Men!

407
00:21:10,439 --> 00:21:13,000
Lord. Lord.

408
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,199
Starting from today,

409
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,920
I won't take any more of the Gu family's unjust beatings.

410
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:30,479
I have one more question.

411
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,839
How did my mother, Lady Bai, die?

412
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,479
What nonsense are you saying?

413
00:21:37,199 --> 00:21:38,119
Wasn't it the case that

414
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:39,119
my mother saved your Gu House

415
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:39,839
with her dowry?

416
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:41,119
She was subsequently

417
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:42,520
forced to death by you.

418
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,520
Utter nonsense!

419
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,800
My mother was tricked,

420
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,199
that's why she married into the Gu family.

421
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,800
No one tricked her.

422
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,400
My mother knew she was tricked,

423
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:54,680
that's why she died from bleeding in childbirth.

424
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,079
No one tricked her!

425
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:06,400
Father,

426
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,160
I will never

427
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,599
believe what you say again.

428
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,439
Second Son!

429
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,640
Who wagged their tongue at him?

430
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:24,920
My heavens.

431
00:22:25,479 --> 00:22:27,319
When Second Son is furious,

432
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:28,439
he's not afraid of deities and ghosts.

433
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,959
He's so scary.

434
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,160
If Third Son

435
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,239
didn't go out to drink,

436
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:35,119
he would cry out of fear.

437
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,199
He's so mighty and tough.

438
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,920
If he and I had been born by the same mother,

439
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,839
I would be at ease

440
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:48,640
to put all matters of this house into his hands.

441
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:52,239
Pity fate isn't so kind.

442
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,160
He had to be given birth by the whore

443
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,479
that killed my mother.

444
00:22:58,839 --> 00:22:59,680
My Lord,

445
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,439
don't worry about not having

446
00:23:01,439 --> 00:23:02,239
anyone to succeed the title.

447
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:04,959
I've already looked into

448
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:05,520
a nice girl for you.

449
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:06,959
Forget it.

450
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:09,680
My body

451
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,880
is like a reed in wind.

452
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,800
Don't ruin another.

453
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,800
I'm already so guilty

454
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,560
that you had to marry me.

455
00:23:22,199 --> 00:23:23,520
I have encumbered you.

456
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:25,719
No.

457
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:26,800
Being married to you

458
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,280
is the

459
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,239
biggest blessing

460
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,199
to me in my lifetime.

461
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,680
I will listen to you, no matter what.

462
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:40,760
It was tough to knock Old Second down.

463
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:43,839
Let's not speak these deflating words.

464
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,719
I have a good appetite today.

465
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:50,079
Go and instruct the kitchen

466
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:53,719
to add a couple more dishes to dinner.

467
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,359
Minister Sheng, may you hold your step.

468
00:24:13,439 --> 00:24:15,239
His Majesty has ordered me to deliver words to you,

469
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:16,439
to have you remain in the palace.

470
00:24:18,199 --> 00:24:18,959
Lord, this way, please.

471
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,959
Interior Officer, do you know what this is about?

472
00:24:24,239 --> 00:24:25,959
I dare not ask about this.

473
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:30,239
His Majesty has given instruction

474
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:31,239
for you to wait here, Minister Sheng.

475
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,640
You're not permitted to leave.

476
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:50,640
It's already near noon.

477
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:53,439
Why isn't the Lord back yet?

478
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,880
The Imperial court should have

479
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,079
ended by this time.

480
00:25:58,079 --> 00:25:59,920
He must be delayed on the way here.

481
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:02,920
Mother, look.

482
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,280
New shoulder belt I got.

483
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,199
The style is the newest

484
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:08,079
in the capital.

485
00:26:08,439 --> 00:26:09,479
Is the color combination pretty?

486
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,000
Flowers are about to bloom in the warm spring.

487
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,000
Count of Yongchang's Madam Wu

488
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,199
is about to put together

489
00:26:17,199 --> 00:26:18,640
a polo match and Chui Wan too.

490
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,959
It'll be perfect to wear these then.

491
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:25,280
You only care about

492
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,800
amusement every day.

493
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:29,719
It's time for you to marry

494
00:26:29,719 --> 00:26:30,680
and you are still like a child.

495
00:26:32,719 --> 00:26:34,239
Game matches and making acquaintances

496
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:35,719
are also to ease getting marriage prospects.

497
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,719
I lacked etiquette

498
00:26:38,719 --> 00:26:39,439
before Madam Wu last time.

499
00:26:39,719 --> 00:26:41,719
This time, it'll be perfect for me

500
00:26:41,719 --> 00:26:42,439
to retrieve back the embarrassment.

501
00:26:43,439 --> 00:26:44,920
You don't know how to play polo

502
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:46,839
and your Chui Wan skills are just so-so,

503
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:47,800
so stop your delusions.

504
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,839
I have never cared about

505
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:53,599
losing or winning.

506
00:26:53,959 --> 00:26:54,640
What matters is

507
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,680
for them to see my composure

508
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,520
as the legitimate daughter.

509
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:00,040
This won't do.

510
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,680
It's almost lunch time

511
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,160
and your father is still not back.

512
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,119
If he's delayed

513
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:07,880
and can't come home to eat,

514
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,400
he should send

515
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,359
someone to tell us.

516
00:27:11,959 --> 00:27:12,920
It's not right.

517
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,920
It feels not right.

518
00:28:15,439 --> 00:28:16,439
Miss.

519
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,439
So how?

520
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:22,359
Father's not back yet?

521
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,479
Dongrong is back.

522
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,479
He said he had never

523
00:28:25,479 --> 00:28:26,199
seen His Lordship come out,

524
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:27,640
so he could only come to give us the news.

525
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,520
Weirui Balcony is in chaos already.

526
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,640
Big Madam is trying to find out

527
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,800
from all outlets.

528
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,599
I hear he was summoned away

529
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:35,280
by the interior officer.

530
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,319
Summoned away by an interior officer?

531
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,560
Can it be His Majesty's intention then?

532
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,839
But Father is just a fifth-ranking minister.

533
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,119
He's never been in attendance with His Majesty alone.

534
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:45,920
If he were to be detained

535
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,760
they would have detained a few other peers.

536
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,280
Father is alone there now.

537
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:51,880
Something's not right.

538
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:54,599
Then it's bad?

539
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:56,439
Stop talking nonsense.

540
00:28:56,439 --> 00:28:58,239
This matter is not that simple.

541
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,920
What's urgent now is to send people

542
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,280
to go find out the reason.

543
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:03,280
Big Madam says the same.

544
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,280
She would send the whole family out

545
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,479
to find out if she could.

546
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:07,880
Second Young Master went to look for

547
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,040
the Second Master of the Gu family too.

548
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:14,000
You have no way either?

549
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:17,359
What's my status?

550
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:18,959
A Gu House scar.

551
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,160
Since I was little,

552
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,359
at annual festival rewards

553
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,040
when going to the palace to give thanks

554
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,680
eight or nine out of ten times I wasn't allowed to go.

555
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:26,800
I only fear

556
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:28,839
Who else knows about this?

557
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,359
That fierce older brother of mine.

558
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:34,839
His maternal family is Marquis of Dongchang.

559
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,520
A distant relative of Her Highness the Empress.

560
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,160
He actually has opportunities

561
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:39,839
to be in His Majesty's audience.

562
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:41,040
That's right.

563
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,479
Come back!

564
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:45,800
Come back.

565
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,319
What's the hurry?

566
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,479
Come here. I want to talk to you.

567
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,000
If you and I had no acquaintance whatsoever,

568
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,000
he'd help you.

569
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:54,239
Now, I fear

570
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,040
he will act like he's sincere but behind you,

571
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,599
he'll stab you.

572
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,760
Who else

573
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,439
can it be?

574
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,439
Can it be your father?

575
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:12,160
Princess Pingning.

576
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:14,680
She grew up in the palace

577
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,760
and she's naturally closer.

578
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,839
That's right.

579
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,479
Okay, I'm leaving.

580
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,599
No need to

581
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:23,359
see me off.

582
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:26,400
Be careful.

583
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,439
You are still not leaving?

584
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,479
Look at the time now and you are still thinking of me?

585
00:30:33,479 --> 00:30:34,280
Go now!

586
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,079
I'm leaving.

587
00:30:39,199 --> 00:30:40,319
Father.

588
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,000
Father.

589
00:30:43,479 --> 00:30:44,920
Coming.

590
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,439
Rongjie, come here.

591
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:53,160
Your Uncle Sheng's father's in trouble

592
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:53,839
and he's fretting.

593
00:30:54,959 --> 00:30:56,479
If something were to happen to your father,

594
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:57,400
would you not be anxious?

595
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,040
Father, don't let anything happen to you.

596
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:06,599
I will

597
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:07,319
finish the kite for you later.

598
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,599
And you'll have me

599
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:10,520
in your clench forever.

600
00:31:23,199 --> 00:31:24,400
Danju.

601
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:27,239
What a coincidence.

602
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,599
I came out to buy incense coils

603
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:29,520
and I ran into you, Brother Buwei.

604
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,920
What do you mean?

605
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,319
I waited for you for a long time.

606
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,959
What's wrong?

607
00:31:34,199 --> 00:31:35,560
It's about your master, of course.

608
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,640
My young master heard

609
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,599
Minister Sheng's incident.

610
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,199
He feared Sixth Miss might fret,

611
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,319
so he had me

612
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:41,239
come out to tell you news.

613
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:50,760
Grandmother. Grandmother!

614
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,599
I heard that Father

615
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,959
Mother, help me!

616
00:31:57,239 --> 00:31:59,040
The Minister is in trouble!

617
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,319
The Sheng family is in trouble!

618
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,640
Shut up.

619
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,920
Stop talking nonsense.

620
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:05,680
If there's anything, speak slowly.

621
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,199
You said it was nothing earlier.

622
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,119
You said perhaps a peer or colleague

623
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:12,439
invited His Lordship for wine.

624
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,560
But Changbai,

625
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,479
he heard from

626
00:32:15,479 --> 00:32:16,400
Princess Pingjing's family,

627
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,839
that His Majesty is angry

628
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:20,680
and locked many in the palace.

629
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,599
Tell me,

630
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:26,079
if someone is locked up for ten days to half a month,

631
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,479
won't he starve to death?

632
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,199
Ridiculous. Even if he were a criminal,

633
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,239
there's no reason to die from starvation too.

634
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:37,280
Did the Princess say what the reason was?

635
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,439
She didn't.

636
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:46,319
Don't worry.

637
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:48,800
His Majesty is kind and magnanimous.

638
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,839
There was no tea in the Imperial Garden

639
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:52,719
and he didn't want the workers

640
00:32:52,719 --> 00:32:53,239
to be reprimanded.

641
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,599
So he would rather keep quiet and bear it,

642
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:57,520
and go have tea at the Empress' palace.

643
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,839
A man like him

644
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:02,000
will not carry out matters recklessly.

645
00:33:02,959 --> 00:33:03,719
Also,

646
00:33:04,199 --> 00:33:05,599
since the founding of our dynasty

647
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:07,400
never was there a scholarly minister getting killed.

648
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:09,119
What are you worried about?

649
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,359
I haven't seen him.

650
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:12,680
It's going to be dark soon!

651
00:33:13,479 --> 00:33:14,959
You are the mother of the family.

652
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,839
Now with trouble pending,

653
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,319
you must bring out

654
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:19,680
your bearing as the Big Madam!

655
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,199
What's the use of just crying in disarray?

656
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,959
Since the Master isn't here,

657
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:27,079
even if there's trouble,

658
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,000
you have to be extra vigilant

659
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,959
and watch the house tightly.

660
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,839
Don't let some cats

661
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:33,560
or dogs sneak in.

662
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,400
Don't create any chaos here too

663
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,000
and be mocked by others.

664
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,920
It just shows she's not his real mother.

665
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,800
There's that division there!

666
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,959
If the Minister were her real son,

667
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,880
with him gone so long

668
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,319
it would only be strange if she's not worried sick!

669
00:33:58,439 --> 00:33:59,599
Now she comes and reprimands me

670
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:01,000
for having no forbearance instead?

671
00:34:02,719 --> 00:34:04,920
What a lousy way to be the main mother!

672
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,320
Don't be angry, Big Madam.

673
00:34:11,479 --> 00:34:13,199
Old Madam has seen a lot

674
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,600
and she's not one to speak grandly.

675
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,639
She says it's nothing,

676
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,439
then she must have some measure of it.

677
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,520
Also,

678
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,959
if something were to happen to Master,

679
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,399
then that's a big calamity to the entire Sheng House.

680
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,840
One loss is total loss,

681
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,360
and Old Madam

682
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,120
wouldn't gloat.

683
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,879
That's true,

684
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:33,479
but she's much too calm.

685
00:34:34,479 --> 00:34:35,639
And bringing in other stuff too.

686
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:36,919
Saying I need to

687
00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:38,800
watch the door and the servants.

688
00:34:38,959 --> 00:34:39,760
I don't need her to teach me.

689
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,199
I've been the Big Madam for decades

690
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,840
and I don't know how to manage the house?

691
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,520
Also

692
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,879
Old Madam.

693
00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:54,120
She said I needed to bring out the bearing of a Big Madam?

694
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:58,560
That's right.

695
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,159
The Lord is not at home.

696
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,040
I'm the head of the house.

697
00:35:03,399 --> 00:35:05,120
If someone in Linqi Pavilion

698
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,719
tries to do anything sly,

699
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,080
and I discover it,

700
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,080
won't it be a

701
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,800
rare great chance for me

702
00:35:12,959 --> 00:35:14,800
to take care of that whore!

703
00:35:17,479 --> 00:35:20,399
Is my brain fried by pork fat?

704
00:35:20,399 --> 00:35:21,520
How come it took me so long to think of this?

705
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:24,000
Old Madam,

706
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,080
she doesn't seem to mean this.

707
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,280
If she were to stay demure

708
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,040
there's nothing I can do.

709
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,600
But if she makes a stir from wind on grass,

710
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:35,959
I will definitely bring out

711
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:37,479
my bearing as Big Madam.

712
00:35:48,919 --> 00:35:51,080
Earlier, before Big Madam came in,

713
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:53,439
what did you want to tell me?

714
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,320
Nothing, it's nothing.

715
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,879
Young Lord.

716
00:36:06,879 --> 00:36:08,159
He had someone bring news

717
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:10,439
to tell me about Father.

718
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,080
I thought you didn't know,

719
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,800
so I came especially to deliver the news.

720
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:16,679
He's thoughtful.

721
00:36:19,479 --> 00:36:23,239
Grandmother, I'm a bit scared.

722
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:25,560
Don't be afraid.

723
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,320
How did Young Lord find out?

724
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,840
Naturally he heard it from his mother,

725
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,919
Princess Pingning.

726
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,080
He can bring the news to you,

727
00:36:39,439 --> 00:36:40,800
that proves

728
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,679
it's not so dangerous after all.

729
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,159
Your father is

730
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:48,239
a minor minister who is prudent in conduct and speech.

731
00:36:48,919 --> 00:36:49,760
What mistake can he make?

732
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:52,000
Even if there were minor mistakes,

733
00:36:52,959 --> 00:36:55,239
it'll be fine

734
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:56,879
after His Majesty vents his anger a bit.

735
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,639
I just fear nothing's happened on the front end,

736
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:04,040
but the back end is on fire.

737
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,199
I hope our family

738
00:37:07,919 --> 00:37:09,199
can get through

739
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:10,239
this trouble safe and sound.

740
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,919
Mistress, is Fourth Miss better?

741
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:37,280
She's young.

742
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:39,399
When she encounters something like this

743
00:37:39,399 --> 00:37:40,360
she will cry miserably.

744
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,120
If I act like her,

745
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,479
how can I survive?

746
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,040
How is it?

747
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,479
Did Landlord Xu sign?

748
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,840
Landlord Xu says

749
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,919
he must meet you in person,

750
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:53,280
and he'll sign and pay

751
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,600
after meeting you.

752
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:56,879
What?

753
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:06,600
How did you manage this?

754
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,919
You take this stack of deeds

755
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:08,840
and you can't find a buyer?

756
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,719
It's precisely because it's so many shops and fields

757
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:13,760
and the merchants in the city all share the news.

758
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:15,560
I'm just an unfamiliar face

759
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,399
and a second or third look,

760
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:18,439
and they'll know I'm not the owner.

761
00:38:19,919 --> 00:38:21,000
We only have Landlord Xu

762
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,760
We only have Landlord Xu who is willing to discuss with me now.

763
00:38:21,919 --> 00:38:23,080
And he insists on seeing the real badge

764
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,320
so he can confirm it wasn't stolen

765
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,679
before he's willing to stamp his fingerprint.

766
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,679
Mistress, maybe we just forget it.

767
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:30,439
The Master is a blessed man.

768
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,840
Nothing may have happened

769
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,679
even if he's locked up in the palace.

770
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,959
What do you know?

771
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,719
My father back then,

772
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,520
he also didn't come home one night

773
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,040
and the second day after

774
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,399
he was jailed and then exiled!

775
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,159
My mother and I

776
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:41,120
were sold.

777
00:38:41,479 --> 00:38:42,520
It was only through favors

778
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,439
that we got into Sheng House.

779
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,280
This kind of incident

780
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,959
must not happen again.

781
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,560
Then we just keep them

782
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,320
with us for now?

783
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,320
If something happens somehow

784
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,600
it's not too late to get away then?

785
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,120
You've never seen what a raid looks like.

786
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:58,479
These shops and these fields,

787
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,840
they are all registered

788
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,800
and accounted for.

789
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,679
Even if you bury the deeds,

790
00:39:02,959 --> 00:39:03,959
they can still

791
00:39:03,959 --> 00:39:04,919
uncover them and confiscate.

792
00:39:05,879 --> 00:39:06,639
We need to do it now.

793
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,600
Now,

794
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,479
we exchange them into unregistered money bonds.

795
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,479
Keep them in hand, and that's how we can preserve it.

796
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:15,679
Now, you go

797
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:17,439
tell that Landlord Xu

798
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,280
to prepare the money and the contract.

799
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,479
As soon as I arrive,

800
00:39:21,479 --> 00:39:22,800
we sign and pay. Now?

801
00:39:22,959 --> 00:39:24,560
Go now.

802
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,600
Go now. Go now!

803
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,520
You are here. Come.

804
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,600
This way, please.

805
00:40:24,879 --> 00:40:26,080
Come, this way.

806
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,679
Come, this way, please.

807
00:40:43,959 --> 00:40:46,280
Come, please sit.

808
00:40:51,919 --> 00:40:52,919
This is my lady of the house.

809
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,360
Come, sit.

810
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,040
No need.

811
00:40:56,879 --> 00:40:57,919
I hear you insist on

812
00:40:57,919 --> 00:40:59,439
seeing the badge before you sign.

813
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,120
I'm here,

814
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,000
so please sign.

815
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,479
How should I address you, Madam?

816
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:09,080
Which house's noble lady are you?

817
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:11,439
Landlord,

818
00:41:11,439 --> 00:41:12,399
I didn't ask your name

819
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,159
and you needn't ask mine.

820
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:16,040
I think the name

821
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:16,959
on this house and land deed,

822
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,919
It's best you don't mention it either.

823
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,679
If you have no intention to sign,

824
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:23,120
I'm leaving first.

825
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,360
Hold your step, Madam.

826
00:41:27,439 --> 00:41:28,840
Madam, don't be angry.

827
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:31,320
I am paying with real gold and silver.

828
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,760
If the deeds

829
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,639
in your hands are clean,

830
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,800
then it's great.

831
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,879
I just worry if there's anything amiss.

832
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,800
So may you let me know,

833
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,560
so I can be put to ease.

834
00:41:42,439 --> 00:41:43,439
I'm paying

835
00:41:43,439 --> 00:41:44,280
quite straight-forwardly.

836
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,639
If later on,

837
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:47,280
there's more business . . .

838
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,719
I'll lower the price another level.

839
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,679
Let you get a nice profit.

840
00:41:51,439 --> 00:41:53,679
If you agree, then say yes immediately.

841
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:56,520
If not, I will turn around and leave.

842
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,760
Let's do this. Two levels.

843
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,719
Two, and I'll sign now.

844
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:02,399
How about it?

845
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,679
What kind of person did you find?

846
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:06,040
He's such a hassle!

847
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:07,919
He's taking advantage.

848
00:42:07,919 --> 00:42:08,719
Madam, Madam!

849
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:10,360
What are you doing?

850
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,360
Come back, come!

851
00:42:11,479 --> 00:42:12,840
Let's talk again.

852
00:42:12,919 --> 00:42:13,560
Take your hands

853
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,439
off me.

854
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,479
Open the door.

855
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,239
Landlord Xu.

856
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:18,120
Come, come!

857
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,080
What's there to talk about?

858
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:19,679
Come here.

859
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,600
Don't touch me!

860
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:23,120
Come, let's have some tea.

861
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,000
Mistress, Mistress!

862
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:26,639
Who are you?

863
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:27,399
What are you doing?

864
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,399
Why are you

865
00:42:28,399 --> 00:42:29,399
capturing me?

866
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,639
Let me go.
