00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Ming Lan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,580
Episode 48

3
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,800
What are you looking at?

4
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,760
What did you say?

5
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,720
I said, what are you looking at?

6
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,520
Let me tell you,

7
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,280
my family

8
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,440
has worked in the imperial army.

9
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,560
Brother Bing, stop talking.

10
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,560
You guys are just nothing!

11
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,200
Don't hit him, Sir.

12
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,000
Sirs, please.

13
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,120
Don't beat him, Sir.

14
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,960
Sirs, No.

15
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,360
Be good now.

16
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,800
Brother Tingbing.

17
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,960
I'll hit you.

18
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,520
Hit him.

19
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,880
No, no. Don't hit him.

20
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,480
Beat him to death.

21
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,520
No, no.

22
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,640
What are you looking at!

23
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,520
I won't look. I won't.

24
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,480
Forgive me, Sir.

25
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,240
Forgive me.

26
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,400
You bastard. Be good now.

27
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,600
Did you hear?

28
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,520
Go.

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,050
First.

30
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,058
Please save your brothers.

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,960
Mother.

32
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,680
Please let him finish

33
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,525
his medicine first.

34
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,240
We sent some people to check

35
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,720
in the prison today.

36
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,490
Tingbing was beaten up so wretchedly inside.

37
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,320
He's lost so many teeth even.

38
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,320
Tingdi's so scared he peed his pants.

39
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,000
He can't even talk anymore.

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,520
And Tingwei.

41
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,080
He's suddenly gravely ill.

42
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,960
He's only got one breath left. Isn't that right?

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,240
You know that brother of yours.

44
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,200
Since he was little, he was raised so preciously.

45
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,240
Usually,

46
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,560
just a stroll around this yard,

47
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,000
and he need three to five people

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,960
to serve him for that.

49
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,240
This is going to take his life.

50
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,400
I know

51
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,680
our Tingdi isn't successful.

52
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,800
But he's your family brother

53
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,400
and blood is thicker than water.

54
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,800
If you continue this,

55
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,440
forget a sentence or interrogation,

56
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,800
he'll be beaten to death.

57
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,480
Yu'er,

58
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,400
if not for others,

59
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,000
at least on the account of this old fifth uncle.

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,600
You got to care.

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,440
I never said I won't take care of it.

62
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,840
But now,

63
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,960
I'm sparring patience with Second.

64
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,440
As long as Tingwei and them

65
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,560
can hold on a bit more,

66
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,280
Second won't just sit and watch

67
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,680
his clan falling in calamity.

68
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,480
You can bear it but I can't!

69
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,560
That's my own son!

70
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,480
Yes.

71
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,280
It seems Fourth Uncle forgot.

72
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,200
Those three scoundrels.

73
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,960
Why were they in prison?

74
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,320
Their plight now

75
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,520
is their own seeking.

76
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,040
I never spoiled them to go and indulge

77
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,360
in liquor and brothels.

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,425
And I never gave my consent to go

79
00:04:33,425 --> 00:04:35,120
and social climb and collude in alliances.

80
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,720
But how is it

81
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,717
suddenly all my fault?

82
00:04:39,717 --> 00:04:41,880
What the hell are you saying?

83
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,680
Sister-in-law, look at him.

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,560
First.

85
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,960
Tingwei is immature.

86
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,440
It's my fault as his mother.

87
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,840
But now,

88
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,080
only you

89
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,160
can save them.

90
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,800
Yes.

91
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,396
I know,

92
00:04:59,844 --> 00:05:01,925
you're pressing yourself to hold on

93
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:03,040
and you have no son.

94
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,520
Pulling this big Gu House along.

95
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,640
It's really not an easy task.

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,931
Today,

97
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,080
if you are willing to give a hand,

98
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,000
with your Fourth and Fifth uncles

99
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,200
as my witness,

100
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,240
I'm leaving these words here,

101
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,000
that we'll find a kid in the clan

102
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,440
let you adopt him,

103
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,000
and he will inherit your noble title.

104
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,625
You are

105
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,145
indirectly scolding me...

106
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,840
that just because I didn't want my noble title

107
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,880
to end up with other people,

108
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,040
I'd rather watch your biological son,

109
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,723
my own brother to die.

110
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,200
You're falsely accusing me!

111
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,200
You're overthinking!

112
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,200
You also should try to understand

113
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,120
the feelings of

114
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,200
parents like us.

115
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,560
Sister-in-law.

116
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,240
This, Yu'er.

117
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,360
An upright person will never beat around the bush.

118
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,120
Do you really never think about this?

119
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,353
That Tingbing and Tingdi

120
00:05:57,353 --> 00:05:58,720
are very close with your third younger brother.

121
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,120
I'm afraid that

122
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,200
you hated that for a long time.

123
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,160
You...

124
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,160
Yu'er.

125
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,200
If you don't have such an intention,

126
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,240
what's wrong with lowering down your head

127
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,720
just for this time?

128
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,160
That's what I 'm driving at.

129
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
That's splashing dirty water

130
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,760
on my deceased parents.

131
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,875
They were also your older brother

132
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:24,800
and sister-in-law.

133
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,200
Just for this family,

134
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,280
they suffered all kinds of grievances,

135
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,960
and have lost their lives.

136
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,360
That's true!

137
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,840
Our older brother, your father,

138
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,880
is watching you from heaven.

139
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,960
I would like to know.

140
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,200
If he's still alive

141
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,125
and he sees you just watching

142
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:44,960
and not saving those three,

143
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,680
would he agree with it?!

144
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,280
That's right.

145
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,560
Husband! Tingyu!

146
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,680
Quickly look for a doctor!

147
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,200
Why are you still standing there?!

148
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,280
Call the doctor!

149
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,720
Call the doctor!

150
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,920
Quickly!

151
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,160
Call someone now!

152
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,680
It's also not easy for the Marquis Gu

153
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,840
to last until now.

154
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,160
Big Madam, you should be prepared.

155
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,960
Is there really no hope?

156
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,840
I have already tried my best.

157
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,375
How about you go ask the Imperial Academy

158
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,120
of Medicine to have him check again?

159
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,480
The imperial doctors

160
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,520
have all come,

161
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,720
and they all say that there's no hope.

162
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,080
I've hidden this from the marquis for half a year,

163
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,320
and I was hoping to seek other famous doctors.

164
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,320
That's why, I was able to find you.

165
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,120
Haven't you cured a lot of incurable diseases?

166
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,735
Please spend efforts

167
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,080
and try again.

168
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,240
A doctor is like patients' parents.

169
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,160
Which doctor doesn't wish that

170
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,080
his medicines can eliminate his patient's illness?

171
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,080
But after all, in curing and saving people,

172
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,880
will still depend on fate and heaven's will.

173
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,320
If the heaven doesn't bless it,

174
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,560
even if Doctor Hua Tuo or Zhong Jing

175
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,840
are still alive,

176
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,720
it still won't work.

177
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,040
I'm taking my leave now.

178
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,360
Husband! Husband!

179
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,360
Husband.

180
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,040
Husband.

181
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,600
You shouldn't hide this

182
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,440
from me.

183
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,560
I was afraid that if you knew,

184
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,360
your illness would become worse.

185
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,920
You were wrong. You were so wrong.

186
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,200
I thought that,

187
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,720
at most,

188
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,600
I could live for another seven or eight years.

189
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,040
hence, I came up with my current plan.

190
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:08,960
If I knew

191
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,680
I only has these days remain,

192
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,750
I can't do it

193
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,452
like this anymore.

194
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,960
Any plans for me isn't important.

195
00:09:19,611 --> 00:09:20,660
Husband,

196
00:09:21,309 --> 00:09:23,237
I only want you to be safe.

197
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,000
Even if I have to eat wild vegetables

198
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
for the rest of my life, I'll accept it.

199
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,280
We can't wait anymore.

200
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,480
Go and get some paper and black ink now.

201
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,960
Go now.

202
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,422
Go now.

203
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:38,880
Go.

204
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,200
Father, don't leave.

205
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,840
I'm afraid. Don't leave.

206
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,960
Don't leave me, Father.

207
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,920
Good child.

208
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,080
Your father...

209
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,960
can't decide on that.

210
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,480
Whatever I say next,

211
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,840
you must remember every single word.

212
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,700
You are

213
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,480
the most intelligent child.

214
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,560
If I'm no longer around,

215
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,040
I'm afraid that your mother can't accept it

216
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,040
You must take good care of her.

217
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,920
Is that okay?

218
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,160
Father.

219
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,320
What are you doing?

220
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,560
This current situation

221
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,000
is really ridiculous.

222
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,240
People who's own children are imprisoned

223
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,000
are not personally begging people,

224
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,480
but instead are forcing me to bear the punishment

225
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,840
and to talk on their behalf,

226
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,280
and take the humiliation.

227
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,760
This isn't about other families.

228
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,520
That's right.

229
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,450
Eldest Brother,

230
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,600
you suddenly have changed your attitude.

231
00:13:24,296 --> 00:13:25,700
Could it be that you want to

232
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,240
agree to my condition?

233
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,880
Eldest, just promise his condition.

234
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,320
It's no big deal.

235
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,700
That's right, Eldest.

236
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,600
Look at this.

237
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,640
If you want a people that you've aggrieved

238
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,200
to turn around and help you,

239
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,275
then you must lower down the bearing

240
00:13:47,275 --> 00:13:48,360
you've put out for so many years.

241
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,720
Don't even think of bluffing your way over.

242
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,080
Tell him what should be said.

243
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,006
Lower down your head to admit your mistake

244
00:13:56,006 --> 00:13:56,960
and repenting on your sins then make up for it

245
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,000
is the proper way to go.

246
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,040
Eldest son is right.

247
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,320
If Second Son

248
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,280
is willing to help his brothers,

249
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,280
even if I have to kneel and admit my mistakes,

250
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,480
I will do it.

251
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,840
It's just that Second,

252
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,960
I want you to promise me one thing.

253
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,160
Give it to Second Brother.

254
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,560
Eldest Son, what are you doing?

255
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,320
How come you still haven't...

256
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,605
This letter

257
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,760
was written by father before he died,

258
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,680
which he handed to the elders of the Gu Clan.

259
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,520
Inside, it's written that

260
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,600
that your birth mother, Big Madam Bai,

261
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,250
has a dowry when she was married

262
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,280
into the Gu Family.

263
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,080
Once he dies,

264
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,440
whether you separate from our family or not,

265
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,080
the dowry must be given back to Gu Tingye,

266
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,760
amounting to 115,000 taels of silver.

267
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,000
In the letter, Father even said,

268
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,560
that the elders of the clan

269
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,400
must read it in front of

270
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,200
the clan members and friends of our family

271
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,640
on his funeral.

272
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,320
Did Father write this,

273
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,760
or did you write this?

274
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,840
That time,

275
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,240
father used all his energy to write this.

276
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,800
Don't you recognize

277
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,320
his handwriting?

278
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,600
Then, what Father wrote,

279
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,760
are these really

280
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,880
what he meant in his heart?

281
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,800
Yes.

282
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,120
Before Father left,

283
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,400
he instructed his last will.

284
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,360
Most are similar to the ones before.

285
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,040
Only your matter

286
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,960
was written by him.

287
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,560
Then during his funeral,

288
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,840
did you people

289
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,720
read father's letter?

290
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,080
Of course, we didn't.

291
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,560
I said that

292
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,640
we can't do such a thing.

293
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,800
After all,

294
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,200
it was the last will of marquis,

295
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,840
how could we disobey it?

296
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,680
But you all...

297
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,360
Ye'er, don't misunderstand.

298
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,000
We elders

299
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,760
only want

300
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,680
to help you manage the wealth and assets.

301
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,080
They are afraid that you would spend them all.

302
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,040
Aren't you thinking too much about this?

303
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,680
Eldest Brother and elders

304
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,840
trampled on me like this.

305
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,520
You even want me to

306
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,800
save your sons.

307
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,800
Eldest Son!

308
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,720
What are you doing?

309
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,960
This list

310
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,160
contains the details of

311
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,300
the marquis assets

312
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,760
since I inherited the noble title.

313
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,120
All the farmlands, banks, and shops,

314
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,000
and all the valuables

315
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,840
passed down by our ancestors,

316
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,640
the book and painting collection for generations.

317
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,960
These documents

318
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,480
is a contract signed by our ancestors

319
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,200
around 30 years ago

320
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,000
in case different houses in Gu Family

321
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,360
will separate.

322
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,850
It is clearly recorded in here

323
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,280
the division of the assets

324
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,520
among the main house,

325
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,000
fourth house, and fifth house.

326
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,680
Eldest Son!

327
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,480
Eldest Son! You...

328
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,560
and how much the other illegitimate houses

329
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,960
got in the past.

330
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Houses, silvers, farmlands,

331
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,160
each were all written in there.

332
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,920
No one can make it fake.

333
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,840
Elder brother.

334
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,920
Are you handing me all the assets

335
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,760
of the Gu family?

336
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,920
Whether I hand it to you or not,

337
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,440
it's enough that you know about it.

338
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,000
Come with me.

339
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,960
I have something to say to you alone.

340
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,920
Go light the candles.

341
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,560
I don't have the strength.

342
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,680
Talking about this ancestral hall,

343
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,920
I'm afraid that among us brothers,

344
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,640
no one knows it better than you.

345
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,440
Of course.

346
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,000
I used to get punished

347
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,120
every three to five days.

348
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,225
I would always be asked to kneel

349
00:22:34,225 --> 00:22:34,800
in the ancestral hall.

350
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,520
If it's dark, I still didn't be released.

351
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,960
A child whose afraid of the dark,

352
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,000
can only look for fire by himself.

353
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,320
Since I started to understand things,

354
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,320
there were already people telling me

355
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,000
that my birth mother, the first Madam Qin,

356
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,720
died because of your mother.

357
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,160
Not only that,

358
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,240
my sickly body

359
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,880
was also a consequence of that disaster.

360
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,520
Whatever bad things happened to the Gu Family,

361
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,400
all would be blamed on

362
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,720
me and my mother.

363
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,680
I'm used to it.

364
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,000
Eldest Brother, did you ask me to come here

365
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,040
just to tell me these?

366
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,600
I don't have the time to

367
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,720
reminisce with you here.

368
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,320
I can see that

369
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,760
your relationship with your wife

370
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,800
is really good.

371
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,880
You kept defending her.

372
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,760
You'm afraid that she'll be aggrieved

373
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,200
by our Gu Family.

374
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,760
What you mean is...

375
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,960
Let me ask you,

376
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,640
if today, our clan is facing a great danger

377
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,700
and you must divorce your wife

378
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,680
to marry another one,

379
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,800
what would you do?

380
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,560
You're saying that

381
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,920
I'll divorce Minglan

382
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,680
just for Gu people like you?

383
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,560
What do you think?

384
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,040
I'm talking about your own family!

385
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,840
Your daughter, your son,

386
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,920
your Shitou,

387
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,320
that nanny

388
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,800
who saw you grow up,

389
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,800
your friends,

390
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,800
like that Second from the Sheng family

391
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,520
or Prince Huan,

392
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,240
those comrades you've fought

393
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,000
with in the battlefield.

394
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,078
If for example,

395
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,680
just to preserve these people's life,

396
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,320
you have to give up your legal wife,

397
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,880
what will you do?

398
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,760
I never think of

399
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,720
any what if.

400
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,260
Even if,

401
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,840
I will lose all my family assets one day,

402
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,440
I will never use a woman

403
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,560
to be the scapegoat.

404
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,600
Even if I end up with nothing

405
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,800
and my reputation completely destroyed,

406
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,840
I will rely on myself to make a comeback.

407
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,800
You've avoided my question.

408
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,440
You didn't answer me.

409
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,880
Fine.

410
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,600
This is a very difficult question.

411
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,004
Our mother chose one.

412
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,200
Father chose one.

413
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,040
You are unable to choose.

414
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,760
It's fine if you don't answer me.

415
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,520
Go look by yourself.

416
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,360
An iron book written with cinnabar.

417
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,160
Read the words written on the back.

418
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,120
Founding of the state and assisting its progress.

419
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,120
I know your plans.

420
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,120
Father indeed married your birth mother

421
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,680
for the sake of the marquis manor

422
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,560
and then you were born.

423
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,040
Afterwards,

424
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,560
he caused your mother's death

425
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,080
and was even harsh on you.

426
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,120
You developed grudges and hatred.

427
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,080
You wanted to

428
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,800
see the marquis manor fall,

429
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,875
for it to lose its noble title

430
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:33,920
and the related documents be destroyed.

431
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,280
Let those that should be imprisoned

432
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,880
or be exiled get what they deserve.

433
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,880
Express all those years of accumulated hatred

434
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,352
you have,

435
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:43,960
am I right?

436
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,840
But the emperor

437
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,320
can't directly take away my noble title

438
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,520
and give it to you.

439
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,240
When the new emperor just ascended to the throne,

440
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,320
you only brought a small troop

441
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,160
to take over your post.

442
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,040
Several huge military camps

443
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,040
submissively listened to your command.

444
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,240
There are so many imperial relatives

445
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,240
around the emperor's side,

446
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,360
who also were decreed and given a military seal

447
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,760
to take over military affairs.

448
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,681
But other than the emperor's brother-in-law,

449
00:27:18,193 --> 00:27:19,720
who was given some respect,

450
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,320
who among them was able to smoothly take office?

451
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,880
It's because your surname is Gu.

452
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,840
Since I joined the army,

453
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,400
I've long changed my name and surname.

454
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,800
That time, my surname was Bai.

455
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,680
Look at your face.

456
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,800
Look again

457
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,520
at your different style

458
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,040
with the whole Yuzhou.

459
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,200
You think that by just changing your name,

460
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,400
people in the military won't recognize you?

461
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,100
They just didn't say it

462
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,760
so you won't get embarrassed.

463
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,160
Several generations of the Gu Family

464
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,400
have been buried in the army.

465
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,360
Joining the battlefield to kill the enemies

466
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,040
is a task that can cause you your life.

467
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,040
It was because your surname is Gu

468
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,600
that's why, they handed their life in your hands.

469
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,320
Your current fame and position,

470
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,880
this official robe you're wearing,

471
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,480
were obtained by through fighting and killing.

472
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,280
But you won't be able to throw away,

473
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,920
get rid of, or sever

474
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:35,194
the blood and fate of being

475
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:36,720
a member of the Gu Clan.

476
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,440
Eldest Brother, you're really something.

477
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,160
The words you said drew blood on first prick.

478
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,200
You're doing this

479
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,680
just to provoke me.

480
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,800
You want me to develop

481
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,000
at least some pity towards the Gu Clan.

482
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,360
You...

483
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,960
Are you gonna help us or not?

484
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,040
What about my condition?

485
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,400
Last night, I've already written

486
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,280
and submitted a memorial.

487
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,160
On behalf of our father,

488
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,025
I sent a request to your mother

489
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,225
a conferred title.

490
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,300
I've also written her life accounts

491
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,240
in our ancestral book.

492
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,280
I'm sure that in a few days,

493
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,240
an imperial decree will arrive.

494
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,800
Your wish has been granted.

495
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,800
Since you've agreed,

496
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,000
of course, I will save them

497
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,080
and help the Gu Family.

498
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,500
Why must you still

499
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,720
make such pretentious act?

500
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,600
Thinking about it...

501
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,440
I don't have much days left.

502
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,160
I also have no descendants to pass my title to.

503
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,760
You can then justifiably

504
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,680
inherit this noble title.

505
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,520
You decide on how to deal with

506
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,760
those people outside.

507
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,440
Eldest Brother,

508
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,280
you're handing everyone

509
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,920
in the Gu Family to me?

510
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,360
In the future, in here,

511
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,800
you will have the final say.

512
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,480
I'm entrusting you my wife

513
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,680
and daughter.

514
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,600
Eldest Brother, you really gave

515
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,400
a lot of thought in this.

516
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,120
If parents love their children,

517
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,800
they should plan their future.

518
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,880
Father has planned mine,

519
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,240
so did he planned yours.

520
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:13,640
Of course,

521
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,040
I must plan for my...

522
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,040
Xian'er too.

523
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,600
Okay.

524
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,160
I promise you.

525
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,280
That Eldest Brother of mine

526
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,600
is indeed the most skilled person

527
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,000
in this world.

528
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,080
All his calculations were

529
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,920
always so accurate.

530
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,000
If he's not

531
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,320
this sick,

532
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:16,840
I'm afraid that

533
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,450
I've longed been a person

534
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:20,560
who can never make a comeback.

535
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,875
I won't be involved in any

536
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,080
of the Gu Family matters anymore.

537
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,280
Even if he was so sick,

538
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,750
you also almost didn't have a chance

539
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:28,520
to make a comeback.

540
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,960
Isn't it all thanks to you?

541
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,439
If not

542
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:43,800
because you told me

543
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,000
those words by the river,

544
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,100
I might still

545
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,860
be a pirate right now.

546
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,200
The heaven is good towards me

547
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,200
and made me meet you.

548
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,800
You're my benefactor.

549
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,044
Actually,

550
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,325
even if your eldest brother won't meddle

551
00:34:07,325 --> 00:34:08,000
in these matters anymore

552
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,120
or if he's gone,

553
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,680
I also will be kind

554
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,800
towards sister-in-law and their daughter.

555
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,360
The mistakes of a man

556
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,160
shouldn't be blamed on the wife and children.

557
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,600
You now know

558
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,525
what kind of people my Gu family

559
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,160
is made up of, right?

560
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,000
They kept calculating everything.

561
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,960
You would be facing them frequently from now on,

562
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,200
so you better be on guard.

563
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,000
Don't I still have you?

564
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,640
My health is still very good.

565
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,920
At least finish your medicine.

566
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,640
With this health of mine,

567
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,360
what's the difference of taking those in or not?

568
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,840
What did mother tell you when

569
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,000
she asked to see you earlier?

570
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,520
Was she complaining that I

571
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,120
shouldn't have told him everything

572
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,320
about the Gu assets?

573
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:26,920
Xian'er,

574
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,480
go get...

575
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,840
She should know about these now.

576
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,880
There's nothing that she can't hear.

577
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,560
Let her stay.

578
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,880
Say it.

579
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,920
Mother, say it.

580
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,360
Mother-in-law urged me to adopt a son.

581
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,575
She said that those from other houses

582
00:35:50,575 --> 00:35:51,160
aren't close to us

583
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,320
and would be hard to disicpline.

584
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,160
Xian'er, the illegitimate son of Third Brother

585
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,800
is quite a nice choice.

586
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,240
She wants to use you

587
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,640
after I've died.

588
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,360
You can't listen to her.

589
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,640
What?

590
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,400
Mother asked you

591
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,360
to adopt the son of Third

592
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,600
so she can easily control you.

593
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,480
I've offended the whole clan

594
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,960
by being good the Second,

595
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,120
because I want to save you and my daughter.

596
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,560
You must remember

597
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,960
to not deliberately create new problems.

598
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,280
I never believed in those afterlife things.

599
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,880
The only thing that I'm worried about...

600
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,920
the only thing that I'm worrried about is...

601
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,120
you two.

602
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,600
By marrying me,

603
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,160
you've destroyed the rest of your life.

604
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,720
Don't say that.

605
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,840
You are the best person in this world.

606
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,600
Even in the next life,

607
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,600
I want to marry you.

608
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,640
You both must remember

609
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,360
the words that I will say next.

610
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,840
Okay.

611
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,600
First,

612
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,120
after I died

613
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,960
no matter who would come to instigate,

614
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,040
you mustn't mention the adoption mater again.

615
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,640
This is an iron rule.

616
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,520
Second,

617
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,280
from now on,

618
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,080
if Second Sister-in law and Big Madam

619
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,480
will be in conflict,

620
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,240
you mustn't get involved.

621
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,080
Especially when Big Madam

622
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,480
asks you to do anything,

623
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,120
you must always be cautious.

624
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,360
It's only these past years

625
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,480
that I've fully understood her.

626
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,240
She's very good

627
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,000
in making other people the target.

628
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,120
No way.

629
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,440
Remember it.

630
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,120
Father, I remember.

631
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,560
Good child.

632
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,840
I can see that Second Sister-in-law

633
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,680
isn't arrogant and harsh.

634
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,640
As long as you do these two rules,

635
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,240
and be more polite with her,

636
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,240
you and Xian'er

637
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:11,925
then won't need to worry

638
00:39:11,925 --> 00:39:12,600
about your future anymore.

639
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,000
Father.

640
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,840
Mother.

641
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,400
I'm coming.

642
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,840
Don't rush.

643
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,560
You must be very happy.

644
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,920
Second now is so successful.

645
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,560
Mother, look.

646
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,520
I've brought you shame again.

647
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,600
I'm worse than Second in everything.

648
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,920
Husband!

649
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,200
Father...

650
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,800
Husband!

651
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,800
I'm coming.

652
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,680
Regarding the case of the rebel prince,

653
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,000
all involved criminals have been

654
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,040
arrested and interrogated.

655
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,960
More than ten of them are actually from families

656
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,160
of officials or nobility.

657
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,300
The degree of their crimes

658
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,280
are also very different.

659
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,160
We're currently verifying them.

660
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,175
In a few days, we'll be able to

661
00:40:49,175 --> 00:40:49,754
hand the final report.

662
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,240
May Your Majesty decide on their punishment.

663
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,000
Regarding the rebellion,

664
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,800
we mustn't tolerate it and punish lightly.

665
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,280
You all must do your investigation strictly

666
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,520
and don't miss anyone.

667
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,280
I will abide.

668
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:06,520
My favored subjects,

669
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,840
do you still have anything you want to report?

670
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,650
Informing Your Majesty,

671
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:17,160
I have something to report.

672
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,480
Say it.

673
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,976
Three male descendants from our House of Gu

674
00:41:22,976 --> 00:41:24,280
were found socializing with the rebel prince

675
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,320
and were imprisoned for it.

676
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,600
But they were not mastermind of the rebellion

677
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,320
and they've also repented their wrong act.

678
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,760
Hope Your Majesty can be lenient

679
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,120
and punish them lightly.

680
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,400
This case hasn't been completely tried, hence,

681
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,480
it's still not time to give any judgement.

682
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:45,400
Your Majesty, my Gu Clan

683
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,400
has been joining war expedition

684
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,000
to the east and west,

685
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,271
and completely devoted to the emperor

686
00:41:48,271 --> 00:41:49,320
since the start of our dynasty.

687
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,150
My father Gu Yuankai has

688
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,680
been garrisoned in the borders

689
00:41:52,686 --> 00:41:53,025
for several years

690
00:41:53,025 --> 00:41:53,680
and achieved great military merits.

691
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,525
My older brother Gu Tingyu

692
00:41:55,525 --> 00:41:56,720
inherited the marquis title,

693
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,520
but he has been sick since young, and recently,

694
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,200
unfortunately passed away.

695
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,840
Only old people and young children

696
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,000
are left in my Gu Clan.

697
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,500
My stepmother and the women in my family

698
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,320
came to implore me.

699
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,120
I then have no choice but to say these words.

700
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,440
Hope Your Majesty can mercy us.

701
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,880
Official Gu, what you're doing is so improper.

702
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,708
The state has its laws.

703
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,400
If anyone commits mistakes in your army,

704
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,040
can you also be lenient in punishing him?

705
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,880
Their crimes are

706
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,280
of course unpardonable.

707
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,800
It's just that those three brothers of mine

708
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,200
have sickly body.

709
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,150
I'm afraid that they can't endure

710
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,000
the hardship of the prison.

711
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,960
I'm willing to get punished for them.

712
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:45,400
If they'll get caned for 50,

713
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,880
I'll bear 30 for them.

714
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,680
If they'll get exiled,

715
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,560
I'm willing to get demoted in place of it.

716
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:05,360
Okay. Get up.

717
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,680
You harboring benevolence

718
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,425
and filial piety towards the Gu Clan

719
00:43:10,425 --> 00:43:11,225
and even repaying their harsh treatment

720
00:43:11,225 --> 00:43:11,640
on you with kindness

721
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,320
is indeed a good thing.

722
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,300
Once the investigation

723
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,400
of this case has been concluded,

724
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,440
when decide the punishments,

725
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,200
I'll consider your situation.

726
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,920
Thank you for your graces, Your Majesty!
