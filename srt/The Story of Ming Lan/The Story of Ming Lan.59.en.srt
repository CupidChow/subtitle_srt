00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,580
Episode 59

3
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,160
You couldn't even invite a person!

4
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,560
It's a waste for me to raise you!

5
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,400
Second's wife is here.

6
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,760
Zhao'er is indeed smart and lovable,

7
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,560
for she's able to invite Minglan to come here.

8
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,120
Ming'er, you're here.

9
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,600
It's my Zhao'er indeed

10
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,480
who can get this honor.

11
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,520
Quickly sit here.

12
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,400
Come. Come slowly.

13
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,612
We're all one family.

14
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,690
We came to congratulate you.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,600
Come. Sit.

16
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:34,200
For what then?

17
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,000
You now are pregnant.

18
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,760
Isn't that something worth being celebrated?

19
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,610
It is indeed a celebratory thing

20
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:40,960
of adding another descendant in the family.

21
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,280
I can see that

22
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,400
our house will become livelier soon.

23
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,800
Mother,

24
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,160
you have invited my cousin here to have a drink.

25
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,400
Sure. Sure.

26
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:53,800
Ming'er,

27
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,960
just have one cup

28
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,413
to bring more joyous atmosphere

29
00:01:56,413 --> 00:01:57,400
to the child in your womb.

30
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,600
More descendants, more blessings and happiness.

31
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,700
I still have morning sickness,

32
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,560
so I can't drink liquor.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,800
Well.

34
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,040
You should indeed be more careful.

35
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,280
Eat more dishes.

36
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,640
I heard that

37
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,680
your house would be taking in a new daughter-in-law.

38
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,000
Which family is she from?

39
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,640
Is it the granddaughter

40
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,880
of that General Fu?

41
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,760
It's still not settled.

42
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,280
That lady has such prestigious reputation.

43
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,440
Let's stop mention it for now.

44
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,920
I then have to congratulate you!

45
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,200
That's one more additional member in your family!

46
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,760
I feel envious

47
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,200
in looking at your two families.

48
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,960
You have so many sons and grandchildren.

49
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,240
While we are talking here,

50
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,840
aren't they about to give you a great grandchild soon?

51
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,580
But our family still

52
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,040
has no grandchild yet.

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,640
Just be patient.

54
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,520
Your Second and Third are still both young.

55
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,320
Later, your house will be full of grandchildren then!

56
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,000
Putting other sons aside,

57
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,960
Tingye is just

58
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,440
the pillar of our House of Gu.

59
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,720
So it would be better

60
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,120
for him to have more descendants.

61
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,080
Whenever I think of this,

62
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,315
I feel that

63
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,320
I don't have the face to see my husband.

64
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,040
Stop being sad about it.

65
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,920
We still have future days.

66
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,200
With our relationship,

67
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,720
if you feel sad,

68
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,080
I also would get sad

69
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,920
and unable to sleep.

70
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,920
Now you're just talking.

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,040
Don't you take it back.

72
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,280
If you really care for me,

73
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,080
you should agree to a request of mine.

74
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:53,960
Request?

75
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,640
What request of yours can I fulfill?

76
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,640
Zhao'er is clever and adorable.

77
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,680
I like her pretty much.

78
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,880
Why don't you just marry her to our House of Gu?

79
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,360
I'll make the decision

80
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,840
to marry her to Second as a concubine.

81
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,440
As long as she's able to deliver more babies

82
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,800
for our House of Gu,

83
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,120
I surely

84
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,320
will dote on her like she's my dearest.

85
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,640
It's the fortune of our Zhao'er

86
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,800
that you're fond of her.

87
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,960
I fear that it's just us

88
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,720
wishfully thinking for this matter to be fulfilled,

89
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,240
while it will only upset my niece.

90
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,480
How could that be?

91
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,680
Don't you know that

92
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,960
our Third Paternal Aunt

93
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,440
even stuffed one into

94
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,160
Second Daughter-in-law last time.

95
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,920
It was Minglan

96
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,880
who decided to keep her.

97
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,760
Let me tell you that

98
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,240
the Second Daughter-in-law of mine has the best temper.

99
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,160
She is very educated and reasonable.

100
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,680
She doesn't do

101
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,360
those jealous acts.

102
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,800
That's so true.

103
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,880
The He Family of Baishitang knows that.

104
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,960
Their Old Madam

105
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,480
really loves this niece of mine.

106
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,133
She so want to marry her in to their family

107
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:12,480
as her granddaughter-in-law.

108
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,400
Before Minglan was set to marry,

109
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,880
that Old Madam would frequently

110
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,120
come to the Sheng Manor.

111
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:22,960
Come,

112
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,160
let's eat.

113
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,160
Mother-in-law, this fish soup is not bad.

114
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:27,960
Let's eat.

115
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,800
Slowly.

116
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,040
There's even a backstory like that?

117
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,200
Then regarding the concubine matter,

118
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,480
there is indeed no need to talk much about it anymore.

119
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,600
Minglan,

120
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,280
Zhao'er is your cousin.

121
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,240
We can say that we know her background very well.

122
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,875
I'm also not asking her

123
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:52,600
to be given any unique position.

124
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,760
She doesn't need to be a second wife,

125
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,640
even just a usual concubine,

126
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,920
as long as she can attend to Second well

127
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,880
and provide our House of Gu

128
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,120
more descendants.

129
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,560
I may agree with the daughters of other families,

130
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,400
but I will never with that

131
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,480
of Auntie Kang's family.

132
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,720
What do you mean?

133
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,146
She's your maternal aunt

134
00:06:18,146 --> 00:06:18,960
from your legitimate mother.

135
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,560
Maternal Aunt is now

136
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,720
the guest of mother-in-law.

137
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,320
But initially,

138
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,760
you two don't know each other.

139
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,920
Now that I've married into this house,

140
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,920
this maternal aunt of mine

141
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,600
acts as if she was raised here in our Gu Manor.

142
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:34,960
But she didn't grow

143
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,520
in my courtyard,

144
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,880
instead

145
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,960
in mother-in-law's courtyard.

146
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,080
To be honest,

147
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,400
if not because

148
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,680
I'm giving honor to mother-in-law,

149
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,760
I find it dirty

150
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,240
to even see this maternal aunt of mine.

151
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,800
You...

152
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,160
Second's wife,

153
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,160
I think your words

154
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,360
are a bit unpleasant.

155
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,120
You're already pregnant.

156
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,360
It's better to lessen your words and dissipate your anger.

157
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,600
Sister-in-law,

158
00:06:59,160 --> 00:06:59,920
there's something you don't know.

159
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,114
Before, when this maternal aunt of mine

160
00:07:02,114 --> 00:07:03,000
goes to our Sheng Manor,

161
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,080
she rarely visits my grandmother.

162
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,280
Especially

163
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,240
since the present emperor ascended to the throne

164
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,640
we never saw her again.

165
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,840
It was your grandmother

166
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,160
who waived my visits.

167
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,720
She didn't waived it.

168
00:07:16,248 --> 00:07:16,880
She instructed you

169
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,160
to stop going to our house.

170
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,400
Even if you come, she won't see you.

171
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,960
What's going on?

172
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,332
They all say that a family's scandal

173
00:07:29,332 --> 00:07:30,040
shouldn't be publicized.

174
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,080
But now,

175
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,640
you've already escalated it to this level.

176
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,040
I also won't care about the shame anymore.

177
00:07:40,355 --> 00:07:41,395
My sister-in-laws and auntie-in-laws,

178
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:42,515
you be the judge.

179
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,520
Don't be upset.

180
00:07:45,711 --> 00:07:46,800
Just say it.

181
00:07:48,037 --> 00:07:49,546
You all know my grandmother.

182
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,320
The only daughter of Marquis of Yongyi.

183
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,400
She indeed has a strong personality,

184
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,520
but also very aloof.

185
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,560
When it's not her business,

186
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,640
she's even too lazy to say anything.

187
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,160
Why would she and maternal aunt

188
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,240
end up in this state?

189
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,680
Maternal Aunt,

190
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,160
your House of Kang

191
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,080
poisoned one person to death five years ago.

192
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,210
One died after being provoking conflict

193
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:11,960
and getting beaten to death two years ago.

194
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,872
A year ago, one corpse but two lives lost

195
00:08:14,872 --> 00:08:15,840
got carried out of your manor.

196
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,360
Maternal Aunt, how many lives

197
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,400
have passed by your hands?

198
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,840
Can you still remember it?

199
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,160
You're maliciously slandering me!

200
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,800
Shut up!

201
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,800
Maternal Aunt,

202
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,699
every time you come to our house

203
00:08:33,699 --> 00:08:34,320
to look for my legitimate mother,

204
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,640
you would always bring her trouble.

205
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,960
My legitimate mother is a very honest person.

206
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,040
Because of her attachment to you as her sister,

207
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,560
she would give you money

208
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,560
or settle your problems.

209
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,520
How much have you embezzled from her,

210
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,880
do you want me

211
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,080
to list them for you?

212
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,400
You're slandering an elderly relative.

213
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,360
That's a crime.

214
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,800
My grandmother told me that

215
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,000
you and my legitimate mother are biological sisters,

216
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,520
you are related by blood,she can do nothing about it.

217
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,800
But I'm not.

218
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,160
I can't just watch

219
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,200
our House of Gu

220
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,640
have a person like you

221
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,280
that's so hard to get rid of.

222
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,200
Big Madam Sheng,

223
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,320
just to not accept a concubine for Second Young Master,

224
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,120
you have to make up such nonsense.

225
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,000
You'll suffer retribution like this.

226
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,880
In my opinion, taking in a concubine or not

227
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,480
is your family's business.

228
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,920
It seems to be getting late.

229
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,160
We'll get going now.

230
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,440
What House of Gu?!

231
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,600
I spit at it!

232
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,840
Shameless!

233
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,920
If not because you

234
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,240
begged me with those kind words,

235
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,971
saying that our Zhao'er has a body

236
00:09:46,971 --> 00:09:47,880
that's good for bearing children,

237
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,010
that she's suitable to be

238
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:49,480
a concubine of your second son,

239
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,480
do you think I would agree to it?!

240
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,400
Now, my whole House of Kang knows

241
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,440
that Zhao'er is going to be given to your Marquis Gu,

242
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,360
but his wife

243
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,320
isn't happy about it!

244
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,080
You...

245
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,000
Your House of Gu is just planning to get rid of me!

246
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,120
I have no face to take her back with me anymore.

247
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,880
Your Gu family decides

248
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,360
if you want her dead or alive!

249
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,040
You...

250
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,560
Let's go!

251
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,760
I'm the one who created this sin.

252
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,840
Second's wife,

253
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,000
the House of Kang

254
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,200
is still an illustrious family.

255
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:31,240
How could they not be worthy

256
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,680
to give Second another wife?

257
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,960
She's your biological cousin.

258
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,720
What you're doing

259
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,000
is forcing her to her death.

260
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,240
Big Madam is still sleeping?

261
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,960
Still sleeping.

262
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,120
Why?

263
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,040
What is it?

264
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:13,880
Nothing.

265
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,200
Big Madam, just rest.

266
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,120
Say it.

267
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,813
That woman from the House of Kang

268
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:21,773
is kneeling outside.

269
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,160
The guards don't know

270
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:23,960
if they should

271
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,840
inform you or not.

272
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,000
Is there no end to them?

273
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,000
Big Madam,

274
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,200
don't be bothered by them.

275
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,280
Just let her kneel.

276
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,120
This is a scheme to win your pity.

277
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,440
Does she think she's in her manor?

278
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,840
Who cares?

279
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,440
If this is some other people,

280
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,680
I won't be afraid even if she dies.

281
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,000
But she's from the House of Kang.

282
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,560
If anything bad happens,

283
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,400
the House of Kang will surely

284
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,440
use her to create an issue.

285
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,400
It's better to still go see her.

286
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,760
I beg Cousin

287
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,040
to pity me and save my life!

288
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,840
I still haven't sat yet.

289
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,200
and you're already saying that

290
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,920
a life depends on me.

291
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,600
I really am not worthy for such a huge responsibility.

292
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,520
My life in your hands.

293
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,640
I just ask that you consider...

294
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,120
that we are

295
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,160
blood relatives,

296
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,640
please save me!

297
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,240
What blood relation do I have with you?

298
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,200
Cousin.

299
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,960
Just because you call me cousin,

300
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,200
you think we're blood relatives already?

301
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,920
I'm not the daughter

302
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,360
of Main Mother Wang.

303
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,400
I'm just an illegitimate daughter.

304
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,360
My birth mother has died long time ago.

305
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,400
Her memorial tablet

306
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,360
is even being offered to by my side.

307
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,480
How then am I blood related to you?

308
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,880
Right.

309
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,360
This morning, you came to apologize to me.

310
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,040
You want to ask me to go there and have some drinks

311
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
hence, you knelt to me.

312
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,040
You made me pity you.

313
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,480
I remembered

314
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,440
my hardships when I was under Main Mother,

315
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,080
so I thought of helping you.

316
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,735
I didn't want you to suffer

317
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,880
in the hands of Maternal Aunt.

318
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,320
But you?

319
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,320
How did you repay me?

320
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,640
I...

321
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,120
From now on,

322
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,800
I surely will serve you

323
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,720
and cousin-in-law very well

324
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,560
to repay your kindness.

325
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,320
One should say sensible things to sensible people.

326
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,080
But to an insensible person,

327
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,480
saying anything is useless.

328
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,120
Nanny Chang,

329
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,840
find some strong maid attendants

330
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,560
to escort her back.

331
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:43,840
No. No!

332
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,480
Yes.

333
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,800
Cousin, please pity me

334
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,800
and just let me

335
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,560
stay in your manor.

336
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,680
I surely will behave

337
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,680
and not compete for any status!

338
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,440
Sister.

339
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,200
If she doesn't leave,

340
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,320
tie her up and bring her

341
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,520
to the door step of the Kang Manor.

342
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,480
You...

343
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,360
Quickly go get a cloth and wound medicine!

344
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,960
Sister, if you won't let me stay,

345
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,240
I'd rather die in the Gu Manor!

346
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:17,960
Big Madam.

347
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,440
Don't worry.

348
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
I'm done bandaging it.

349
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,680
Her wound isn't that grave,

350
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,440
just with scary looking.

351
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,800
Nanny, just say the truth.

352
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,200
Don't make up things to make me feel at ease.

353
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,920
That is the truth.

354
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,480
Big Madam, if you don't believe it,

355
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,640
you can personally go look.

356
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,480
Good.

357
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,240
It's good that no one died.

358
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,280
I was negligent.

359
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,080
I never thought that she will be carrying a weapon.

360
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,360
I was too negligent.

361
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,560
Big Madam, don't worry.

362
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,400
I'll send her back

363
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,560
after bandaging her wound.

364
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,040
No.

365
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,480
I...am thinking...

366
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,680
why don't I...just take her in?

367
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,440
Miss, are you crazy?!

368
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,400
She said she wants to die in the marquis manor.

369
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,880
It's fine if there are

370
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,640
a hundred deaths in the Kang Manor.

371
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,280
But if one corpse get carried

372
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,520
out of the marquis manor,

373
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,160
and it's even a female corpse,

374
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,640
why would the people outside say?

375
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,000
Who cares what they'll say?!

376
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:25,920
Even if Marquis returns,

377
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,320
he won't accept her.

378
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,080
Marquis would get accused of a crime out of nowhere.

379
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,480
Marquis is a favored subject of the emperor,

380
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,600
the good brother of Prince Huan.

381
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,800
Why would he be afraid of that?

382
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
Nonsense!

383
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,040
Quickly shut up!

384
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,920
Prince Huan is the son of His Majesty.

385
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,360
How could anyone

386
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,760
be worthy to be brothers with him?

387
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,520
Yes, I was wrong.

388
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,960
You all don't understand.

389
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,920
We're now in dangerous times.

390
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,920
The Shen Family has been targeted.

391
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,160
General Xiao Duan

392
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,280
is still locked up in Kaifeng Precinct.

393
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,400
Marquis is working hard in the front line.

394
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,800
We can't bear to have

395
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,920
another crime accused to us.

396
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,560
Why not just

397
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,120
take her in?

398
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,880
That niece of mine

399
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,120
is a natural born lowly scoundrel.

400
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,128
If you drag her, she won't move

401
00:16:18,128 --> 00:16:18,840
instead, she will move backward.

402
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,120
If I didn't ruthlessly stab her twice like that,

403
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,720
she wouldn't even know how fierce I am.

404
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,040
Didn't she

405
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,880
now obediently

406
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,840
take Zhao'er in?

407
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,160
That little bitch.

408
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,062
She dared to embarrass me

409
00:16:32,062 --> 00:16:33,000
in front of so many people?

410
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,360
If I allow her

411
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,600
to have one good day to live,

412
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,600
I'm not a human then.

413
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,240
That Zhao'er

414
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,360
is an obedient child, right?

415
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,200
Her birth mother's life

416
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,560
is in my hand.

417
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,720
If she doesn't listen,

418
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,280
I can surely make her listen.

419
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,080
That's good.

420
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,040
That's good.

421
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,960
We are really old.

422
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,200
We only wish that

423
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,640
the children can be obedient,

424
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,440
so we can worry less.

425
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,080
We indeed were able to

426
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,120
find a scissor like Zhao'er now.

427
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,760
We don't have any other equipment to use.

428
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,760
Not just scissors,

429
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,400
dashing into poles or walls to commit suicide,

430
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,920
hanging herself or jumping into the well,

431
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:23,909
starving herself or taking in poison,

432
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:24,920
which wouldn't work?

433
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,880
We only need to

434
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,840
take a look every 3 to 5 days.

435
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,160
There will come a day that

436
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,520
she won't be able to hand us a person but a corpse.

437
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,840
By then, we don't really need to do anything

438
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,600
and just spread this news out.

439
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,360
Someone will eventually come forwards

440
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,240
to sue that little bitch.

441
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,560
You...

442
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,680
are talking in such a terrifying manner.

443
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,480
Big Madam.

444
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,600
Our Second

445
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,240
is after all a close subject of the emperor.

446
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,920
He's highly favored.

447
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,720
This little brat

448
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,560
is the darling of his heart.

449
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,640
If you take care of her,

450
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,360
that one from our house

451
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,880
will kill people if he goes wild.

452
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,000
I...

453
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,200
I just want to get him a concubine.

454
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,920
It's his wife who forced someone to die.

455
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,560
Even if he's so all-powerful,

456
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,640
can he disobey the laws of our empire?

457
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,640
Calm down. Calm down.

458
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,400
Endure it.

459
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,040
Endure it and forget it.

460
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,560
Just leave this child

461
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,840
to be Second's concubine.

462
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,720
Stop getting involved.

463
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,520
If someone dies,

464
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,760
that's too scary.

465
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,640
If you're afraid, just forget about this matter.

466
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,000
Really.

467
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,560
You have guts that are worse than that of a chicken.

468
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,880
Sister Wang!

469
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,360
Sister...

470
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,640
Technically speaking,

471
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,200
we really have to

472
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,640
thank that Nanny Chang.

473
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,680
If not because she talked nonsense

474
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,760
and angered Madam Kang,

475
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,560
making the Madam a laughingstock

476
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,720
of the whole Bianjing,

477
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,280
that stupid woman

478
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,560
wouldn't also dare to risk it all.

479
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,048
Big Madam, you've also

480
00:19:37,048 --> 00:19:38,480
exhausted yourself these past days.

481
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,600
You can now be at ease

482
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,960
and rest for a few days.

483
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,320
With that Miss Kang causing trouble like that,

484
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,000
Second's wife didn't show any reaction?

485
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,480
She's still resting.

486
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,520
It seems she got severely traumatized.

487
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,840
A female attendant under her

488
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,600
called Cuiwei

489
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,200
got on a carriage

490
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,560
and went to the Sheng Manor.

491
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,720
She acted so calm.

492
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,080
I thought she really was very capable.

493
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,880
So, she also went back to her maiden family now

494
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,960
to move in some reinforcement.

495
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:31,960
Are you awake?

496
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,680
Grandmother?!

497
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,520
Why are you here?

498
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,240
If I still don't come,

499
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,920
you'll get gobbled up already.

500
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,440
Who's that tattletale

501
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,440
to even have you come here?

502
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,520
Really.

503
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,800
I'll clearly tell you.

504
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,760
It was Cuiwei who reported it to me.

505
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,840
She was sincerely worried about you

506
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,760
and you still called her a tattletale?

507
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,120
If not because she was loyal,

508
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,160
you would have walked into your doom.

509
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,600
I'm not there yet.

510
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,440
Just because your husband loves you,

511
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,000
those concubines won't get any favor.

512
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,800
They would eventually

513
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,200
get thrown to one side.

514
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,640
Let me tell you that

515
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,320
if it's really just taking in a concubine,

516
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,080
I won't be coming here.

517
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,320
Go

518
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,440
and get that lady.

519
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,280
Let's ask her.

520
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:38,840
Cuiwei.

521
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,880
Yes.

522
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,440
Your Big Madam is still muddled.

523
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,480
Go and get that woman.

524
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,400
I want to interrogate her.

525
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,000
Yes.

526
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,240
How is your womb?

527
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,040
You didn't get too mad, right?

528
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,560
No.

529
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,320
A woman giving birth to a child

530
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,880
is a matter of

531
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,880
going around the gates of hell.

532
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,680
Put down everything else.

533
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,280
You have me.

534
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,120
Okay already. Okay already.

535
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,040
Say, Old Madam,

536
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,080
we've agreed while we were still in our house

537
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,480
that you will ruthlessly scold

538
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,520
Sixth Miss once we arrive.

539
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,760
But upon coming here, you can't even bear to.

540
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,680
Sixth Miss.

541
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,080
You are now a Big Madam,

542
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,160
a marquis wife.

543
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,480
When that servant is brought here,

544
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,640
sit on the side too.

545
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,920
Quickly get up to comb your hair and put on make-up.

546
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,040
Get up. Get up.

547
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,400
You old woman. She...

548
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,880
She hasn't seen her grandchild for a long time.

549
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,760
Hence, she can't bear to see us two

550
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,680
being so sweet together.

551
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,560
Okay already.

552
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,160
She'll be here in a minute.

553
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Go now.

554
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,800
Stand a bit nearer to us.

555
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,320
You are a child of Concubine Su of the Kang’s.

556
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,840
You still have a little sister

557
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,720
and a little brother after you.

558
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,840
Am I right?

559
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,160
Yes.

560
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,800
Your father, Lord Kang,

561
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,400
has a lot of concubines and children.

562
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,800
Now, there are three who's waiting to be married.

563
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,880
One is you.

564
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,160
One is your 11th Older Sister.

565
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,360
Her birth mother is currently heavily favored.

566
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,680
One is your 14th Little Sister.

567
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,960
Her birth mother...

568
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,880
is a good concubine that Lord Kang

569
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,920
officially taken in from the province.

570
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,600
How did you know all about these, Old Madam?

571
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,320
Tell me then,

572
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,760
why did your legitimate mother, Lady Wang,

573
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,360
choose you

574
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,280
to be a concubine in the House of Gu?

575
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,920
What do you think, Ming'er?

576
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:06,769
It must because Maternal Uncle-in-law

577
00:24:06,769 --> 00:24:08,320
Kang is such a womanizer.

578
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,722
Maternal Aunt

579
00:24:10,722 --> 00:24:11,920
endured a lot

580
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,040
just to take in charge of their household.

581
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,720
Hence,

582
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,160
the life and future of most of

583
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,114
the children in the House of Kang

584
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,760
is controlled by Maternal Aunt.

585
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,120
The birth mother of cousin Zhao'er

586
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,800
has no maiden family nor backer inside the house.

587
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,720
She's also not highly favored by uncle-in-law.

588
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,960
She can only have other people manipulate her life.

589
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,600
What cousin said were all true.

590
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,080
She said...

591
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,160
if you let me stay,

592
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,800
and I would find an opportunity to hurt myself,

593
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,800
she would then come here to defend me.

594
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,080
If you won't take me in as a concubine,

595
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,160
she told me to find a chance to hurt myself,

596
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,600
and she'll come here

597
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,800
to seek justice for me.

598
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,160
I just need to claim that you forced me to do so.

599
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:04,800
By then, you have no choice but to accept me.

600
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,000
If it will be just tricks like that,

601
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,320
do I need to come here

602
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,520
and ask you?

603
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,080
You still want to cover up for her?

604
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,280
The whole capital knows that

605
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,600
since Marquis married his main wife,

606
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,560
everyone in his courtyard was sent away.

607
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,160
Your legitimate mother has been socializing

608
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,440
with that person from the adjacent courtyard every day.

609
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,600
How could she now know this?

610
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,232
You are also not that beautiful.

611
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,200
On what basis can she be sure

612
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,600
that you'll get favored here in the marquis manor?

613
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,160
She just want you to die!

614
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,520
You still want to cover up for her?

615
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,480
But…

616
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,960
But my birth mother...

617
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,000
is still under her control...

618
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,320
Cousin! Cousin!

619
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,880
I beg you!

620
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,600
Just let me stay here!

621
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,360
Only by staying here

622
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,240
can my Little Mother live!

623
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,240
Or else...

624
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,840
my little sister

625
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,160
will get sold to the brothels!

626
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,840
Cousin...

627
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,200
I'd rather be the one to die

628
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,760
than to see them die.

629
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,920
So pitiful.

630
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,280
But since you were little,

631
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,000
you have seen her tricks.

632
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,800
You believe that if you die,

633
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,480
she'll spare

634
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,360
your siblings and birth mother?

635
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,720
I...

636
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,760
What should I do?

637
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,160
What can I do?

638
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,760
Silly child.

639
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,760
Tell the truth.

640
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:05,960
She.

641
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,800
She's a sinister woman

642
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,120
with a rotten heart.

643
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,560
She wants me to find a chance

644
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,920
to die in the marquis manor.

645
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,680
She will then come to collect my corpse.

646
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,640
She also must see...

647
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,960
must see several scars

648
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,320
on my body.

649
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,400
She said that this way,

650
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,720
she can go to the local court

651
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,920
to sue your marquis manor

652
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,543
for treating lives as trifle

653
00:27:36,543 --> 00:27:37,920
and forcing a good concubine to her death.

654
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,480
She said, that this way,

655
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,920
not only will the Marquis unable to save you,

656
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,280
even he himself

657
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,040
would get dragged down and trampled to death!

658
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,280
Do you now understand

659
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,960
why I must

660
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,200
personally come here?

661
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,600
Ming'er,

662
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,800
you decide.

663
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,040
You also know

664
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,280
that I wasn't born

665
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,480
by a main madam.

666
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,600
I also lost my birth mother since I was little.

667
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,800
I frequently think that

668
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,880
if it's not because of my grandmother's benevolent love,

669
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,600
my fate would have been like that

670
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,280
of a wandering duckweed.

671
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,840
Hence, I've thought of

672
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,594
going with you to the front receiving hall

673
00:29:06,594 --> 00:29:07,360
to drink some wine.

674
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,080
I wanted you to be spared from punishment.

675
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,560
Yes.

676
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,600
I wronged you, Cousin.

677
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,960
I wronged you...

678
00:29:19,339 --> 00:29:20,139
I...

679
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,800
I'm willing to give you

680
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,760
two paths to take.

681
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,720
Either you enter my manor

682
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,800
and attend to Marquis with me.

683
00:29:34,985 --> 00:29:36,560
I'm sure that

684
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,640
nothing will happen to your birth mother anymore.

685
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,840
Thank you! Thank you, cousin!

686
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,560
Thank you, Cousin!

687
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,880
I'll destroy my face now!

688
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,480
I will not make you have any worries!

689
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,480
Stand well!

690
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,280
Let her finish.

691
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,520
Or, you have another path.

692
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,880
Our House of Sheng

693
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,760
has some prestige in Youyang.

694
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,120
Later, change your clothes and disguise

695
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,160
as my grandmother's maidservant.

696
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,800
Go to the Sheng Manor with her.

697
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,200
The Sheng Family will be the one

698
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,800
to negotiate a marriage for you in Youyang.

699
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,280
With the Sheng Family as your backer,

700
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,680
I'm sure that no one in Youyang

701
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,040
would dare bully you.

702
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,240
But,

703
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,520
I fear that

704
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,320
it won't be a very wealthy family.

705
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,560
Which path do you want to take?

706
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,920
But...what about my Little Mother?

707
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,960
Maternal Aunt Kang would think that

708
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,560
I forcefully sent you there.

709
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,738
She might not really make things difficult

710
00:30:47,738 --> 00:30:48,640
for your birth mother.

711
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,000
By then,

712
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,261
my Sheng Family would be the one to explain

713
00:30:52,261 --> 00:30:52,840
this to Maternal Uncle-in-law Kang.

714
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,680
Settle this marriage.

715
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,760
Once we've taken the open path,

716
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,160
your Little Mother will surely be fine.

717
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,600
You have two paths to choose. Say something!

718
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,800
Cousin,

719
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,640
I don't want to be a concubine.

720
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,400
I'd rather die than become a concubine.

721
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,040
Cousin,

722
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,960
my mother said

723
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,600
that no one is naturally endowed to be lowly.

724
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,680
Who doesn't want to get married

725
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,320
and be a legal wife?

726
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,600
Cousin,

727
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,760
I don't want to be a concubine.

728
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,240
I'd rather die than to be a concubine.

729
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,320
The people from Sheng house have left?

730
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,720
They left.

731
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:03,530
Southern Tang Dynasty's Li Houzhu

732
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,800
Wait and see.

733
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,440
The great show of Sheng House.

734
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,480
It's about to open.

735
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,640
How dare she commits such an idiotic deed!

736
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,120
She didn't.

737
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,280
That great older sister of yours.

738
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,320
Heart of a wolf and lung of a dog.

739
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,840
Not half a showing of an official's wife.

740
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,320
She can't rope in her husband

741
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,360
or manage her children.

742
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,520
With so much idle time to her,

743
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,665
she takes the concubine's

744
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:39,760
illegitimate daughter to vent.

745
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,880
Other than to implore her maiden siblings,

746
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,360
what other skills does she have?

747
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,760
Wicked tongued and cruel and evil.

748
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,706
She should be taken to the shrine

749
00:32:48,706 --> 00:32:49,960
for family punishment.

750
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,388
But wasn't it said that it was

751
00:32:52,388 --> 00:32:54,520
Grand Madam Qin of the Gu House

752
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,680
who became fond of Zhao'er on her own?

753
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,360
You already know that

754
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,080
and you dare to say you're not aware?

755
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,080
I only just heard of it too.

756
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,200
I've always treated

757
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,280
Minglan and Rulan the same.

758
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,995
Go find your black-hearted sister.

759
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,120
Tell her off to the clear.

760
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,440
No matter what she schemes,

761
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,040
we are not willing on this matter.

762
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,240
If she still wants

763
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,400
to keep this Sheng relative,

764
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,320
have her visit Minglan to bid her apology.

765
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,800
What?

766
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,800
What maternal aunt

767
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,560
goes to apologize to the niece?

768
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,760
Wouldn't Minglan be afraid it will shorten her life?

769
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,800
Also,

770
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,320
bringing in concubines is a common matter.

771
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,280
Even if my sister did wrong,

772
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,113
since things already happened,

773
00:33:43,113 --> 00:33:46,160
why not just go with it?

774
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,360
You . . .

775
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,760
You just said you regarded

776
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,400
Minglan as your own.

777
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,640
Rulan's mother-in-law

778
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,520
tried to get a concubine for her son many times.

779
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,360
How did you go to fight for Rulan?

780
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,440
Hualan and son-in-law Yuan

781
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,360
just became amiable recently.

782
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,040
And you urge Hualan

783
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,920
to straighten those little ones early on.

784
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,240
This is how you conduct yourself

785
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,080
with your own daughters.

786
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,960
You regard Minglan as your own daughter?

787
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,480
Alrigt, alright.

788
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,880
I will go right away, tomorrow.

789
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,080
Go now.

790
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,640
But it's already dark.

791
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,520
If your sister is with matter,

792
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,680
not to mention now,

793
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,200
even if it's midnight,

794
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,760
she's come knocking on the Sheng door.

795
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,480
What?

796
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,880
She can come but you can't go?

797
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:41,920
Roll off.

798
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,760
It's a rare trip you're making, Sister.

799
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,720
What's wrong though?

800
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,960
Big Sister, what disaster did you create?

801
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,800
You just had to make a mess

802
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,480
at Gu House and cause me

803
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,520
to be scolded and berated by my mother-in-law.

804
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,200
Hurry and bring that girl back

805
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:40,960
and pay a smile to Minglan.

806
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,560
Or else we can't even be sisters

807
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,520
in the future.

808
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,280
I knew you'd come.

809
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,920
I didn't think you'd come so fast.

810
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,000
It shows that girl Minglan's

811
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,680
fretting on fire now.

812
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,760
Feels so great!

813
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,880
You, you!

814
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,920
You can still laugh?

815
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,520
You're ruining me!

816
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,920
How am I ruining you?

817
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,480
I am securing your wealth and prestige.

818
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,520
What do you mean?

819
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,720
That Gu Marquis of yours

820
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,000
is rising fast in fame and power.

821
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,440
It's obvious that his future will be unlimited

822
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,920
in wealth and prestige.

823
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,160
And your family

824
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,200
can get some shine along with him.

825
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,080
But haven't you thought of it?

826
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,840
That golden Gu wife of yours,

827
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,800
is she on your side?

828
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,120
Don't you say that.

829
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,760
Though she was

830
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,040
raised by the Old Madam,

831
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,000
she's never been bad in greetings and rules.

832
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,200
She's always

833
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,400
rule-bound in my sight too.

834
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,760
If she really shares the same mind as you

835
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,760
and respects and honors you,

836
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,000
then when you asked to take me

837
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,800
to Xiaoluling hotsprings,

838
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,880
why didn't she go?

839
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,080
And she mocked you to your face too.

840
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,040
It's not her.

841
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:01,920
It's

842
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,000
my mother-in-law.

843
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,240
Correct! That's correct.

844
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,840
She's only good with your mother-in-law.

845
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,640
She's only married to Gu House recently.

846
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,360
You wait till she's secured her footing.

847
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,120
Will she put you to her sight?

848
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,200
I think you'll end up

849
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,080
unable to straighten your back at Sheng’s forever.

850
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,080
Then is that Kang Zhao'er one-minded with you?

851
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,920
You didn't

852
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,920
birth her either.

853
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:25,840
Scared of her?

854
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,600
Her real mother is in my hand

855
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,600
and if I tell her to go east,

856
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,120
will you see her going west?

857
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,240
These girls raised by the concubines

858
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,000
need to be disciplined periodically.

859
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:41,760
So they

860
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,560
don't forget their status

861
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,720
and somehow think they can really become a phoenix

862
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,920
after flying to the branch.

863
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,400
I had that Zhao'er stay at Gu House.

864
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,080
Once she's grasped that Gu Marquis in her hands,

865
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,480
that wretched girl Minglan,

866
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,040
would she dare to disobey you?

867
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:57,640
Then I would have Zhao'er

868
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,640
put in dissent before Marquis Gu.

869
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,960
You're my real younger sister.

870
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,760
Minglan that girl,

871
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,400
if she wants to live well, she will have to listen to you.

872
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,880
You keep her grasped

873
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,480
and it's the same

874
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,640
as having grasped your mother-in-law.

875
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,360
Wouldn't you be in such a glee then?

876
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,840
That'd be great indeed.

877
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,360
But my mother-in-law,

878
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,800
what am I supposed to tell her?

879
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:23,960
Scared of her?

880
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,240
We have our Wang House and you're scared of her?

881
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,960
In a few days,

882
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,080
our entire family will return to the capital

883
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,360
for post and our prestige

884
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,520
will only be bigger.

885
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,335
Your mother-in-law should be

886
00:38:33,335 --> 00:38:34,080
watchful of your moods instead.

887
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,040
Would she dare

888
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,280
to divorce you?

889
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,600
You don't know.

890
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,097
Though she's the legitimate mother

891
00:38:39,097 --> 00:38:40,240
who isn't blood-related,

892
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,520
my husband cares about

893
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,000
Confucian honor above everything.

894
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,040
He's truly so filial and devoted to her,

895
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,320
so afraid to be written up by the imperial censor.

896
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,720
Men are just men.

897
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Do you actually believe that

898
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,680
whole husband and wife as one?

899
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:52,840
Big Sister.

900
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,280
You and brother-in-law don't get along

901
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,484
doesn't mean everyone else in the world

902
00:38:56,484 --> 00:38:57,320
doesn't get along too.

903
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,040
That whore Concubine Lin is gone now.

904
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,240
My husband and I are still . . .

905
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,640
quite amiable.

906
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,000
Can he listen to you on everything?

907
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,360
Actually he really does go along with me.

908
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,040
Those idiots of Kang House.

909
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,708
Father and Mother-in-law

910
00:39:29,708 --> 00:39:30,800
are so magnanimous and wise.

911
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,160
How did they birth a thing like her?

912
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,240
I will take charge

913
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,280
and send Zhao girl to Youyang.

914
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,960
I suppose you are not keen on her

915
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,920
going to Gu House either.

916
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,640
Of course I'm not willing.

917
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,400
Minglan is my real daughter.

918
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,760
She's most attentive.

919
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,040
And such a prominent son-in-law.

920
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,880
Do you think it's easily garnered?

921
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,100
All thanks to Marquis Gu

922
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,200
and Changbai being close friends.

923
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,960
In the future,

924
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,520
his officialdom and our family's flourishing,

925
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,040
will rely on his help quite a bit.

926
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,320
Our family

927
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,240
hasn't tasted the sugar yet.

928
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,360
And that Kang House wants to come

929
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,560
and snatch it first? How shameless they are.

930
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,720
You don't need to get so worked up too.

931
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,400
Watch your health.

932
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,600
We are Kang's relative

933
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,200
but our acquaintance is very detached.

934
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,440
You and I both dislike

935
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,480
that big sister-in-law.

936
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,880
The entire capital knows Marquis Gu and

937
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,720
and his stepmother don't get along.

938
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,400
But Kang House just has to go

939
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,560
and befriend the stepmother.

940
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,320
It's obvious to slap his face.

941
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,400
She causing this disaster

942
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,120
is one thing.

943
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,240
But she just had to do it under our name.

944
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,040
Now this Kang House

945
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,080
is so wanton and unrestrained.

946
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,160
All because she thinks

947
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,560
she's the favored eldest legitimate daughter of Wang House.

948
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,880
And Wang House

949
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,760
will soon return to the capital for their post

950
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,960
and she will have an even bigger backer.

951
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,600
She belittles our Big Madam

952
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,240
and our family.

953
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,560
So she thinks the marquis manor

954
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,160
is at her easy reach too.

955
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,560
She has the shame to belittle us?

956
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,720
Look at those offsprings

957
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,320
of Kang House.

958
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,520
Which one is successful?

959
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,400
Their house is clearly coming to ruin.

960
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,240
The Wang House,

961
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,160
they were indeed quite prestigious back then.

962
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,600
If it hadn't been my father-in-law's early death

963
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,480
and my brother-in-law's

964
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,480
lack of talent that wasted away the family asset,

965
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,520
they wouldn't have fallen to the plight

966
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,440
of only returning to the capital now.

967
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,720
Wang House is your wife's maiden home.

968
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,040
At the summit of their glory,

969
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,480
they consented the marriage of your wife to you,

970
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,360
who was only a Confucian scholar who just rostered.

971
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,120
They are considered having given our Sheng a grace.

972
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,360
We are not in position to say anything.

973
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,080
But Kang House noses herself up?

974
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,720
Couple days ago,

975
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,840
Lord Kang asked you a favor?

976
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:02,890
Yes.

977
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,480
Mother means . . .

978
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,640
But Lord Kang and I

979
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,160
are relatives.

980
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,440
He's a sensible man.

981
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,440
And this matter

982
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,560
is something I already consented long ago.

983
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,920
So it's not suitable . . .

984
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,760
Fine.

985
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,400
That Kang House is so uppity

986
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,400
with their nose already.

987
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,400
And you are still a runner for them?

988
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,680
You're so scared of him?

989
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,560
How many mess did we clean up

990
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,040
for Kang House?

991
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,480
Just pick out a few casually

992
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,480
and they are enough for Kang House to lose face.

993
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,400
Yes.

994
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,360
I am not saying their face

995
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,840
needs to drop to the ground.

996
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,040
We just need the Kang's to know

997
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,400
that our Sheng House isn't for them to bully.

998
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,040
Mother's words are right.

999
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,000
I will do as you say.

1000
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,040
Go and take care of it now.

1001
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,800
Go right this minute?

1002
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,520
It's being so late now,

1003
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,600
so it's better to wait till tomorrow.

1004
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,080
Go.

1005
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:08,640
Yes.

1006
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,560
I'll go right now.

1007
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,280
The couple...

1008
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,280
They both didn't care about Minglan.

1009
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,840
They're just coveting

1010
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,120
the little bit power she has,

1011
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,240
or trying to scoop some food

1012
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,520
out of her bowl.
