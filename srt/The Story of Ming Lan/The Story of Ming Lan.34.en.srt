1
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,833
Episode 34

3
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,584
Have a drink!

4
00:01:04,584 --> 00:01:05,240
Drink！

5
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,400
Second Brother Bai,

6
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,040
you should just stay

7
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,839
at our Yuzhou longer.

8
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,400
That General Xie

9
00:01:13,401 --> 00:01:14,760
depends on you now,

10
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,920
and he won't rush you back.

11
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:16,840
That's true.

12
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,610
Hang out with us more.

13
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,170
What's so great about that army camp there?

14
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:22,700
If it's up to me,

15
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,160
we'd have the militia to write a letter

16
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,800
and ask for you.

17
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:26,920
Geng,

18
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,760
you're drunk.

19
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,520
My father can't keep him.

20
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,240
If we had known how severe this riot was

21
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,200
in the south,

22
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,640
we should've gone with them together

23
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,040
to knock the rebels,

24
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,880
instead of staying here

25
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,120
in this small, stifling Yuzhou!

26
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,173
You saw that I set a merit

27
00:01:44,173 --> 00:01:44,960
and got a title promotion,

28
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,360
so you're jealous.

29
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,040
I'd love to have you come too actually,

30
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,640
but your madam won't agree.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,899
Lingnan is full of high hills

32
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:52,520
dangerous waters,

33
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,203
and lots of poison and malaria.

34
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,920
If your madam finds out,

35
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,280
she'll eat me.

36
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,080
You men

37
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,160
have the grief

38
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,160
of having tigresses at home.

39
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,120
Watching the house so tight,

40
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,080
so where do you even want to go?

41
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,400
I think

42
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,880
my madam is the virtuous one.

43
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,600
I'll come with you.

44
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,000
Here, let me pour for you.

45
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,040
Don't leave after we finish the meal.

46
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,360
I need to talk to you.

47
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,840
Here. Eat the food!

48
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,400
Do you have news of Chang?

49
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,200
If that were the case,

50
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,920
why would I evade the others?

51
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,480
I would've drummed

52
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,000
to celebrate already.

53
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,240
I asked my Canal Gang buddies

54
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,920
on my trip to the south too.

55
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,480
But there's no news still.

56
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,600
Don't rush. The future has a long way to go.

57
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,876
After some time,

58
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,080
I'll find someone

59
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,544
to look into the west side.

60
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,200
Your Manniang

61
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,024
is Chang's real mother after all.

62
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,840
She won't mistreat him.

63
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,080
I hope so.

64
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,360
For now,

65
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,400
I have an important matter

66
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,560
to discuss with you.

67
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,080
A few days ago,

68
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:07,760
you got

69
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,890
a promotion command.

70
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,520
For me,

71
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,840
I got a secret Imperial edict!

72
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,320
Secret Imperial edict?

73
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:17,272
About what?

74
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,800
His Majesty first

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,988
praised us,

76
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,600
saying we are diligent and loyal,

77
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,720
Sage and merit-bound.

78
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,880
Then he mentioned

79
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,451
how his health is just

80
00:03:29,451 --> 00:03:29,960
getting worse by the day,

81
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,999
and in the future when a new emperor ascends,

82
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,565
he wants us, father and son,

83
00:03:33,565 --> 00:03:34,720
both to assist with all our might,

84
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,960
and we will have a great future ahead.

85
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,520
So the Crown Prince has been selected?

86
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,720
His Majesty is entrusting to cares everywhere

87
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,200
to pave the way for the new emperor in the future.

88
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,880
My father and I are of the bloodline

89
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,080
of Emperor Taizong,

90
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,440
so we have been a cold house for years.

91
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,360
Even if we have a friend like you with us,

92
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,000
we can only recommend you out

93
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,280
so we don't court the suspicion of others.

94
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,040
Now he's sent us

95
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,273
this edict especially.

96
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,600
My father hasn't slept

97
00:04:04,776 --> 00:04:05,665
in many nights.

98
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,200
You are from the Dongjing precinct,

99
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,720
so do you know anything?

100
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,400
I think

101
00:04:13,731 --> 00:04:14,838
you needn't worry too much.

102
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,825
Even if His Majesty is trying to

103
00:04:16,825 --> 00:04:17,880
restrain the Imperial clans,

104
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,360
the first ones to clean up

105
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,440
are the few in Bianjing.

106
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,200
Those are the big trees

107
00:04:24,525 --> 00:04:26,423
who have the power to fight for the throne.

108
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,240
Yuzhou is no pivotal army command

109
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,266
nor some affluent area.

110
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,320
Even if the intention were here,

111
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm afraid that the capital was not enough.

112
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,760
That's what I said too.

113
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,160
But for my father,

114
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,526
you know how he is even if I don't say it.

115
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,811
I might not say these as a son.

116
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,800
But he is too timid to go out

117
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,920
if it's raining heavily outside.

118
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,440
He's afraid the rain will crack his head.

119
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,400
Now a secret Imperial edict came,

120
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,840
and my father was

121
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,000
truly not at ease.

122
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,280
How about this?

123
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,240
It's not too busy

124
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,160
at Xie's command right now,

125
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,280
so I'll stay.

126
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
I'll be your father's little servant

127
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,880
to guard

128
00:05:08,253 --> 00:05:09,341
and help him watch the house.

129
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,400
How's that?

130
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,880
The hell with that!

131
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:13,120
You're a newly

132
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,920
promoted officer

133
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,876
and you'll work as a servant?

134
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,160
Although my father and I

135
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,560
have a bit of hereditary nobility,

136
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,480
we can't afford you.

137
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,960
Then seal the house,

138
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,120
and hire a few extra guards to watch.

139
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,200
Tell your father to sleep with ease.

140
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,200
I've got everything.

141
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,560
If the summons from the capital hasn't come,

142
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,480
then nothing's the matter.

143
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,600
When the summons comes,

144
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,080
we'll make our plans then.

145
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,360
Where can I find some new guards

146
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,360
to watch this manor?

147
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,680
If we don't know their background thoroughly,

148
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,360
it's just planting trouble.

149
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,360
I saw so many unfamiliar faces

150
00:05:51,369 --> 00:05:52,720
when I arrived earlier.

151
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,160
I thought

152
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,480
they were your servants.

153
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,400
They are not new?

154
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,240
Come here!

155
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,705
Brother Bai?

156
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,680
Did you see a few new faces,

157
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,640
dressed as household servants

158
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,480
about my height?

159
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,640
I did see some new faces

160
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,268
and they are from the pub, delivering food.

161
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:11,850
They said they're leaving right away,

162
00:06:11,869 --> 00:06:12,970
so I didn't ask much.

163
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,520
Which direction did they go?

164
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,640
To the east.

165
00:06:15,645 --> 00:06:16,594
The militia went with them right behind.

166
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,760
The militia said

167
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,680
they're going to

168
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,840
check the farmstead.

169
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:22,800
Crap.

170
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,800
What's wrong?

171
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,640
Hurry and get the horses!

172
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,280
The most beautiful thing on earth

173
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,760
isn't the high summit or the beautiful water.

174
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,360
It's these grain fields.

175
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,240
With these,

176
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,840
Yuzhou will be secure.

177
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,560
Sir

178
00:09:16,726 --> 00:09:18,683
Zhonghuai, you're finally here!

179
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,080
Watch out.

180
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,640
Move!

181
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,320
Speak! Who sent you?

182
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,880
Father. Father.

183
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,360
Father, are you alright?

184
00:10:55,056 --> 00:10:55,610
Hurry and get up.

185
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,000
Zhonghuai, he's going to kill himself!

186
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,000
Men!

187
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,560
Take him to interrogate!

188
00:11:36,452 --> 00:11:37,252
Let's go.

189
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,720
You won't talk,

190
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,621
and you'll have to suffer

191
00:12:03,621 --> 00:12:05,040
some skin and flesh pain.

192
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,360
I know you're all suicide fighters.

193
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,160
Even if the knife is cutting into your neck,

194
00:12:16,207 --> 00:12:17,215
you won't blink.

195
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,200
However,

196
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,080
what I want today isn't your life.

197
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,960
It's your guts.

198
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,000
You won't talk,

199
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,840
and I'll use these tools

200
00:12:52,047 --> 00:12:53,680
and try each one on you.

201
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,720
If you're not dead yet

202
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,680
by then,

203
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,120
I'll use this knife

204
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,760
and cut off your flesh,

205
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,400
one piece at a time.

206
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,200
I've got life preserving ginseng soup too

207
00:13:17,885 --> 00:13:19,368
to keep you alive.

208
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,960
A butcher lived across my home.

209
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,840
Since I was little, I watched him butcher animals.

210
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,463
Sometimes,

211
00:13:33,463 --> 00:13:35,800
in order to keep the meat fresh for one day,

212
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,760
he'd keep the animal alive.

213
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,520
These tricks, I know them all.

214
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,120
If you don't believe me,

215
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,760
you can try it.

216
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,240
The meat on the chest is the thickest.

217
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,760
Even when you cut it a hundred times

218
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,840
you only get half a bowl of blood.

219
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,200
So we'll start from here then.

220
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,800
It's Prince Yan!

221
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,960
It's

222
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,000
it's His Highness Prince Yan!

223
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,920
He sent us.

224
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,705
You should've told me sooner

225
00:14:29,705 --> 00:14:31,600
so I wouldn't have to exhaust all this energy.

226
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,080
Why?

227
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,840
Prince Yan and I have no grudges

228
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,480
so why does he want to kill me?

229
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,840
We only just received the secret Imperial edict

230
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,200
and he sends the assassins.

231
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,680
I fear it's about installing the royal heir.

232
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,672
How does installing the royal heir

233
00:14:57,672 --> 00:14:58,280
have anything to do with me?

234
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,440
Even though I'm an Imperial clansman,

235
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,840
I was not born into the high nobility

236
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,160
and I have no vast connections.

237
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,080
With what would I fight with Prince Yan

238
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,560
and why does he oppose me?

239
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,600
I'm afraid

240
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,120
it must be because

241
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:16,881
Prince Yan thought,

242
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:17,960
that Imperial edict to be on standby for assistance

243
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,680
was actually a Crown Prince installation edict.

244
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,680
Now the matter of naming the royal successor

245
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,520
is causing huge chaos

246
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,760
in Bianjing.

247
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,680
Prince Yan already has his own army ready.

248
00:15:29,681 --> 00:15:30,600
Any slight movement,

249
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,360
and he will think it's real.

250
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,480
I seal my house and sit at home,

251
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,680
but the calamity falls from sky.

252
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,480
Maybe

253
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,320
I should go hide in the farmstead

254
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,360
outside the city for a few days.

255
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,800
You can tell them I went to live

256
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,640
in the Buddhist monastery outside the city.

257
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,240
If more assassins come,

258
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,560
we can at least have some countermeasure.

259
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,520
Father.

260
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,851
We are of the bloodline

261
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:05,560
of the great ancestors,

262
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,560
descendants of the Imperial family.

263
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,960
To be this scared

264
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,920
isn't this a joke to others?

265
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,640
What do you people know?

266
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,680
Preserving your life is what matters.

267
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,000
Sir.

268
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,080
Since Prince Yan is already thinking that it's real,

269
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,640
he would rather

270
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,960
kill mistakenly than to not kill.

271
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,160
If he wants to kill you,

272
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,240
you can't hide anywhere.

273
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:41,760
I think

274
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,920
we go the whole hog to

275
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,160
go to Bianjing

276
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,123
and see His Majesty.

277
00:16:49,123 --> 00:16:50,280
Tattle on him!

278
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,800
Tattle?

279
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,400
Since we can't protect ourselves,

280
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,960
why not attack as our defense?

281
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,600
Instead of sitting here waiting to be killed,

282
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,080
it's better to take a risk to make a move.

283
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,960
We go to Bianjing furtively

284
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,760
and meet His Majesty.

285
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,400
Make public

286
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,520
the evil deeds of Prince Yan.

287
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,600
Even if we can't report his mistakes,

288
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,240
at least we can let the world know

289
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,240
his evil intention.

290
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,040
At the time, Prince Yan will actually

291
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,320
be motivated to try to keep you alive.

292
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,760
This...

293
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,400
Will it work?

294
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,520
Father.

295
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,040
Since the founding our dynasty,

296
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,360
no Imperial heirs could kill other Imperial heirs.

297
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,840
The more we concede,

298
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,120
the more we allow others to kill us off!

299
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,640
We must go to the extreme only

300
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,720
and kill off Prince Yan's thought altogether!

301
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,040
That is the long term solution.

302
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,560
Sir, if you're worried about the travel,

303
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,920
we can disguise ourselves as merchants

304
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,360
and as long as we are cautious,

305
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,320
we can arrive at the capital smoothly.

306
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,560
Father.

307
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,546
Zhonghuai has the strength and bravery

308
00:17:52,546 --> 00:17:54,200
that ten thousand men cannot resist.

309
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,480
If we add those few brothers

310
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,680
from Duan House who can fight and kill,

311
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,040
where would your worry be then?

312
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,880
I think I had better just go

313
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,640
and live in the farmstead a few days first.

314
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,553
His Majesty won't leave

315
00:18:10,553 --> 00:18:11,600
the crown prince's seat vacant forever.

316
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,120
As long as the Crown Prince is set for sure

317
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,400
and Prince Yan knows it's nothing to do with me

318
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,880
then he will give up.

319
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,760
Zhonghuai.

320
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,440
Prince Yan is coming out so fiercely,

321
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,840
I don't think

322
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,600
he will only send

323
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,240
one group of assassins.

324
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,240
My father's worry

325
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,480
isn't out of reason either.

326
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,080
We have always been

327
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,760
a worry to the royal court.

328
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,720
It's all because of my father's prudence

329
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,880
and carefulness that we can survive until today.

330
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,520
If he had my foul temper,

331
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,280
I think we would lose

332
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,400
Our lives long time ago.

333
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,040
If we delay any longer and

334
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,760
the royal court political situation is set,

335
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,680
then it's useless for us to go to the capital then.

336
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,320
I knew you're trying to push us

337
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,720
to the capital,

338
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,880
not only to escape trouble.

339
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:23,360
Think about it.

340
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,840
This Prince Yan.

341
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,080
He's so boldly and openly making attempts

342
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,320
to assassinate an Imperial heir.

343
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,664
It's possible the capital might

344
00:19:29,664 --> 00:19:30,320
already be in revolt.

345
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,240
I don't even know if His Majesty is still there.

346
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,440
I fear a round of bloodbaths is imminent.

347
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,589
In danger

348
00:19:38,589 --> 00:19:40,160
Our chance can come.

349
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,760
You and I agree on that point.

350
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,200
My father and I have lived in Yuzhou for so long

351
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:47,941
as more than a decade,

352
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:48,640
and no one has asked about us.

353
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,920
Our lives are less than that of a

354
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,040
fifth-ranked minister in the capital.

355
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,640
Yet we are descendants of the Zhao Imperial clan.

356
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,320
Instead of just dragging along our lives

357
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,880
in Yuzhou

358
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,200
training a mediocre militia,

359
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,880
why not ride on this chance,

360
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,240
and aim for a revolution in our lives?

361
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,000
Your Lordship has this great ambition

362
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,200
and I shall follow you with all my life.

363
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,480
Let's go.

364
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,000
Go.

365
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,120
Zhonghuai,

366
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,240
we are closest to Geng's house here.

367
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,000
But we're going around by Shen House.

368
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,960
Isn't this adding extra danger?

369
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,880
The Madam at Geng House is a tigress.

370
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,080
If we

371
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,040
just show up

372
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,080
without any prior notice,

373
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,640
I fear that Old Geng is going to be

374
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,440
scolded scolded much.

375
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,840
The Madam at Shen House is amiable

376
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,600
and she won't dislike and avoid us.

377
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,360
You give each person a different treatment then.

378
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,280
Aren't you scared of Madam Geng?

379
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,000
Just thinking of that makes me scared.

380
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,280
Hurry up and go to the capital.

381
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,600
We're going to the capital immediately!

382
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,120
Great!

383
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,240
Such sighs and gloominess.

384
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,360
What's happening?

385
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,320
This morning,

386
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,760
someone from the palace came.

387
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,560
They invited the wives

388
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,320
of the Fourth and Fifth Houses into the palace,

389
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,143
saying it was an invitation by Her Highness

390
00:24:58,143 --> 00:24:59,160
the Imperial Consort Rong.

391
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,240
Duke Ying and Duke Yue's

392
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:02,960
madams were there too,

393
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,400
but they just overlooked us,

394
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,400
the First House.

395
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,320
My adopted son Yu's wife didn't go either?

396
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,680
No.

397
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,720
Not just the palace.

398
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,360
The entire city of Bianjing

399
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,760
is full of snobs!

400
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,720
They see that the new Marquis is sick,

401
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,600
with no official duty or power,

402
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,360
and useless

403
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,040
so they just throw us aside.

404
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,600
When the old Marquis was alive,

405
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,240
our manor

406
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,560
was so bustling.

407
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,640
You've worked for me for so many years already.

408
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,160
You should be more sensible in the Marquis Manor.

409
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,440
Why are so you still so short-sighted?

410
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,600
Imperial Consort Rong summoned them,

411
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,440
and what's it for?

412
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,080
It's to form private party alliances.

413
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,960
In the long term,

414
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,320
there will be trouble.

415
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,760
Those two fools

416
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,080
in Fourth and Fifth Gu Houses,

417
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,280
are still trying so hard to add to the mix.

418
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,080
They'll end up in misery soon.

419
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,720
You are right, Big Madam.

420
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,960
Close to this one

421
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,280
and aloof from another then.

422
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,320
Not far or near,

423
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,560
and it appears forgotten.

424
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,560
How to balance in the middle well

425
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,080
is so difficult that should

426
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,480
be gone into by hundreds of scholars.

427
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,360
What's more,

428
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,400
though Yu inherited the Marquis title,

429
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,640
it's only temporary.

430
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,320
He's so weak

431
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,480
that won't have years to live.

432
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,320
Once he dies,

433
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,720
my Tingwei

434
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,280
will be the next Marquis of Ningyuan.

435
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,760
As long as the Marquis title

436
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,000
is always in our grasp,

437
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,400
it will be endless

438
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,520
glory and wealth.

439
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,673
We don't need to play up

440
00:27:06,673 --> 00:27:07,520
to that Consort Rong.

441
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,760
Remember.

442
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,640
These are just grass insects after the autumn.

443
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,720
Once this season is over,

444
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,760
they are done.

445
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,080
That's true,

446
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,120
but there's still the other one

447
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,360
before Third Young Master.

448
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,360
That scoundrel?

449
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,360
Who knows if he's already

450
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,400
died as a drunkard somewhere.

451
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,680
Even if he hasn't died,

452
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,920
Gu clan's elders

453
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,680
won't let that

454
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,800
unfilial one

455
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,124
who infuriated his father to

456
00:27:37,124 --> 00:27:39,040
cause his death to inherit the noble title.

457
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,480
But before the old Marquis died,

458
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,680
Father in law has been gone many days.

459
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,320
I don't know

460
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,280
if they are sufficient in food

461
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,440
and sleep at the palace.

462
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,200
Sister in law, you're not worried about Father.

463
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,760
You're worried about Second Brother, right?

464
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,800
I'm not talking about him.

465
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,520
It's just that installing a crown prince

466
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,560
is an internal palace matter.

467
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,000
My husband works in the Rites Bureau

468
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,840
so it's not a surprise that he was summoned.

469
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,320
But Father in law

470
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,520
isn't from Rites Bureau,

471
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,280
so why was he summoned?

472
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,440
He said His Majesty was rushing them,

473
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,960
and they had to be fast and thorough too,

474
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,320
so that's why they were so busy.

475
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,360
They said they needed

476
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,440
more hands to help out.

477
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,240
The Crown Prince is the future Emperor,

478
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,400
so this matter can't be reckless.

479
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,257
First, the Astrology Bureau

480
00:28:50,257 --> 00:28:52,640
needs to select an auspicious date.

481
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,097
Then the Rites Bureau needs to

482
00:28:55,097 --> 00:28:56,720
check the ancient books of records

483
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,200
to draft the procedure and write the edict,

484
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,720
and then promulgate it to each province and city.

485
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,440
And they need to dispatch envoys

486
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,560
to pray to the spirits in all directions.

487
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,400
Produce all the ceremonial robes and crowns.

488
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,857
The high ministers also have to

489
00:29:10,857 --> 00:29:12,240
present memorials to congratulate.

490
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,320
This repeats exhaustingly.

491
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,960
And not to mention the grand conferment ceremony.

492
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,686
They need to pray and make offerings

493
00:29:22,686 --> 00:29:24,440
to the gods, and seek and answer inquiries.

494
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,320
Just more difficult work!

495
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,240
Your turn.

496
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,040
I went, Grandmother. There.

497
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,320
My husband and father in law won't be back

498
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,160
until next month.

499
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,440
They are not main officials in it.

500
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,240
They are just doing

501
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,720
literary and letter chores.

502
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,440
I think they should be done soon.

503
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,360
Your turn. Hurry.

504
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,680
Sister in law, don't worry.

505
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,560
You don't need to ache

506
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,800
for Second Brother's labor.

507
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,040
Minglan is more mischievous as she grows.

508
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,717
You know your sister in law is shy,

509
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,120
and you're teasing her!

510
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,240
I already told Second Brother

511
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,040
last month

512
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,920
that I would send fish soup to him.

513
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,960
I'd make it personally.

514
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,680
This is great then.

515
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,720
The fish has been sent

516
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,440
from Youyang homestead

517
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,640
and he's confined to the Imperial palace instead.

518
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,760
He's so unlucky with food.

519
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,000
Maybe,

520
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,312
if the officials are detained

521
00:30:20,312 --> 00:30:21,240
in the palace to work,

522
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,080
they should be living in the front courtyard.

523
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,880
As long as they are not there as hostage,

524
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,080
they are allowed visits from family,

525
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,440
to deliver some food or items.

526
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,680
Really?

527
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,760
We can enter the Imperial palace too?

528
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,280
Why not?

529
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,880
Just as long as you don't run wild.

530
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,480
Then...

531
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,680
Perfect to deliver some fish soup,

532
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,760
and Changbai will have some luck with food then.

533
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,080
Then Sister in law,

534
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,800
let's go together to visit Second Brother.

535
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,440
And your father.

536
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,440
Before my husband left,

537
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,480
he said to watch over the house.

538
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,800
And he told me not to worry about him too much

539
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,040
and don't go around much.

540
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,480
So I won't go.

541
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,840
You deliver it for me, Sister.

542
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,200
Alright then.

543
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,520
Sixth Miss,

544
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,840
how did you make this dried fish?

545
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,160
It's divine.

546
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,560
It's very simple.

547
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,720
You slice the fish,

548
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,240
and you let it pickle in salt ginger water

549
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,520
and cold wine.

550
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,200
You add chopped green onions to warm oil,

551
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,360
and then you pan fry back and front.

552
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,480
Everyone's busy and doing exhausting work.

553
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,480
You may not have an appetite,

554
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,200
This dish is spicy and salty,

555
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,112
sour and sweet too.

556
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:46,720
It's great for courting an appetite.

557
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:47,920
It will make the rice go down easily.

558
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,520
It does indeed.

559
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,520
If it's good, eat more.

560
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,560
Thank you.

561
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,040
Minglan,

562
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,560
we're not home lately,

563
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,120
how's everything at home?

564
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,720
It's all well.

565
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,280
Big Madam and Sister-in-law miss you so much.

566
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,680
They are waiting for you two to return soon.

567
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,000
Nonsense.

568
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,200
How can you say that so recklessly?

569
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,360
You'll make others laugh.

570
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,920
Eunuch.

571
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,240
I will have to trouble you

572
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,160
to toil again soon,

573
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,840
to escort my daughter out of the palace.

574
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,920
I think it's time she should go,too.

575
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,040
I don't know why,

576
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,200
I discovered no one is guarding the palace gate.

577
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,600
I yelled many times,

578
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,600
and no one came to open the gate.

579
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,800
The palace gate is closed at midday?

580
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,080
That's never happened before.

581
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,240
Yes.

582
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,400
Why is the gate closed

583
00:32:59,400 --> 00:32:59,960
in the middle of the day?

584
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,560
It's true.

585
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,432
I also have a bad fate.

586
00:33:12,432 --> 00:33:13,280
Despite getting pregnant a few times

587
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,920
I was unable to keep them until childbirth.

588
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,080
I fear that being a vegan

589
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,520
and praying to Buddha every day is all for naught.

590
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,920
Your Highness, don't talk like that!

591
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,105
How come the people that came today

592
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,840
are all wives of military officials?

593
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,160
Those who are usually very close

594
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,200
with the House of Rong didn't come.

595
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,320
You noticed it too?

596
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,480
No matter how favored an Imperial consort

597
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,320
without any descendants is,

598
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,960
it's still just like a sun that's about to set,

599
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,360
a locust after autumn.

600
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,520
She doesn't even know to curb her arrogance,

601
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,000
so as not to offend too many people.

602
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:43,849
What if those people settle accounts

603
00:33:43,849 --> 00:33:44,320
with her afterwards?

604
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:45,680
Lower down your voice.

605
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,710
There's an auntie in our house.

606
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,880
who gave birth to her fifth child.

607
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,680
Your Highness!

608
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,200
Your

609
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,440
Your Highness! Bad news!

610
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,040
What's happening?

611
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:57,960
What's going on?

612
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,560
What's going on?

613
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,720
Why are you panicking?

614
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,720
Look at how disheveled you look.

615
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,560
So improper!

616
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,720
Your Highness,

617
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,240
don't know who opened

618
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,360
the Xihua Gates earlier

619
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,440
and some people have broken in!

620
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,560
Youcai Qian went to check it,

621
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,960
but didn't return for a long time.

622
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,640
I then boldly went after him.

623
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,560
I discovered that

624
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,840
he's already dead

625
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,200
above the railing beside the Xihua Gates.

626
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,120
Someone's dead!

627
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,360
Go.

628
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,680
Close the main gates.

629
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,680
No one is allowed to move around.

630
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,120
Your Highness,

631
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,800
you are admirable for staying so calm

632
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,200
when a disaster is coming.

633
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,680
Drag him out and execute him.

634
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,920
Your Highness! Have mercy, Your Highness!

635
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,120
Your Highness!

636
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,760
It's you

637
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,680
who colluded with those

638
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,280
outside and let them in?

639
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,360
That's right.

640
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,360
I had you all come today without

641
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,440
any intention of letting you go back.

642
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,880
Your Highness!

643
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,120
We didn't do anything wrong!

644
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,760
All the wives are in my hands.

645
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,200
If inside or outside Bianjing,

646
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,400
any general or army troop

647
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,320
dares to make any false moves,

648
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,200
I will make his house

649
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,200
a broken home.

650
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,480
We don't have any grudge with you.

651
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,520
Why must you harm us like this?

652
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,840
No grudge?

653
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,080
May I ask

654
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:02,960
which of you didn't mock

655
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,240
at my family background?

656
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,055
My little sister Feiyan suffered a heinous crime.

657
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,640
You all also just gossiped

658
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,530
and ridiculed her,

659
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:12,040
forcing her to die!

660
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:13,880
Now,

661
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,320
thinking about that His Majesty

662
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,440
doesn't have many days left,

663
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,520
my glory will also be gone soon.

664
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,680
You all are just waiting to laugh at me, right?

665
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,840
No not at all!

666
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,600
Especially you,

667
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,360
Princess Pingning of the Second Rank!

668
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,280
If not because of

669
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,520
your precious son,

670
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:43,880
my little sister

671
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,560
wouldn't have died.

672
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,480
We also were left with no choice.

673
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,760
What a good excuse!

674
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,520
Being left with no choice, but in the end

675
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,316
it is my family that's crying,

676
00:36:54,316 --> 00:36:55,240
and your family that's laughing.

677
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,281
My little sister's decaying corpse

678
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:58,040
buried under the earth,

679
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,880
while your son enjoys his wedding night!

680
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,600
Today, I don't really need to

681
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,200
deceive you and detain you here.

682
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:08,880
But I really can't

683
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,080
endure this anger.

684
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,640
Now,

685
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,680
the society is changing.

686
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,960
I'm going to let you personally see

687
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,200
your ending.

688
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,400
Take her away!

689
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,360
No!

690
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,560
Let go of me!

691
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,480
Let me go!

692
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,440
Your Highness!

693
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,600
There's no more mountains in front,

694
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,600
just flat plains and rivers.

695
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,200
We have to travel slower.

696
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,360
The closer we get to Bianjing,

697
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,680
the more there will be the spies of Prince Yan.

698
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,560
We must move forward carefully.

699
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,680
You're very familiar with this area.

700
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,840
We will listen to you.

701
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,880
We will then divide into two groups

702
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,040
and have some people wear the clothes

703
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,040
of your father's and yours.

704
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,600
One group will travel on the official road

705
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,400
while one will take the short cut.

706
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,920
No matter how many Prince Yan's people are,

707
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,640
we can delay them for a day with it.

708
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,280
Okay, we'll do it like that.

709
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,400
Move!

710
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:51,880
Let me go.

711
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,560
What are you planning to do?

712
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,440
Let me go!

713
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,960
So

714
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,080
you two have colluded?

715
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,240
When you and your wife

716
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,720
harmed my little sister,

717
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,680
did you ever think that this day would come?

718
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,120
How dare you!

719
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,360
His Majesty is still in power.

720
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,240
I'm still an Imperial consort.

721
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,800
Just for a son-in-law,

722
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,750
you harmed my biological sister,

723
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,120
destroyed her reputation,

724
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,229
and had our family have nowhere

725
00:39:47,229 --> 00:39:48,080
to file our complaint!

726
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,440
If in the future,

727
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,200
If I allowe you to ascend to the throne,

728
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,160
would you still give me any importance?

729
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,440
You bitch! A woman from the marketplace!

730
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,560
Rebels

731
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,880
Rebels!

732
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,480
Let's go.

733
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,880
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

734
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,400
Your Majesty!

735
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,440
The rebel army has surrounded Funing Palace Hall

736
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,200
and currently ramming at its doors!

737
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,164
I fear that they won't

738
00:40:31,164 --> 00:40:32,120
be able to hold on any longer.

739
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,560
Are there still paths out of the palace?

740
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,120
The whole Imperial city

741
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,840
is full of rebels!

742
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,000
They've guarded all palace gates so tightly

743
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,720
and tightly packed!

744
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,200
Something must have happened.

745
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:47,920
What sound is that?

746
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,200
They are killing people.

747
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,440
Killing people!

748
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,680
There are corpses everywhere outside.

749
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,408
You're saying that

750
00:40:54,408 --> 00:40:55,800
there are killings inside the palace?

751
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,120
This

752
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,520
Who are the killers?

753
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,520
They are all wearing soldier uniforms.

754
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,305
You can't really discern

755
00:41:01,305 --> 00:41:02,080
from which army they are from.

756
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,560
They just kill anyone they see.

757
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,480
They even

758
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,160
Even what?

759
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,840
They even drag palace servants

760
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,240
into corridors and do indecent acts!

761
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,360
My god!

762
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,800
How could such a thing

763
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,920
happen inside the palace?

764
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,520
Yes.

765
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,160
How far away

766
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:19,960
are those killers from here?

767
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,960
They are about to reach our gates.

768
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,080
Quickly block the gates.

769
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,040
No, we can't.

770
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,120
This would have been

771
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,080
an abandoned palace hall

772
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:27,480
Which was just temporarily allocated

773
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,360
to the Ministry of Rites for use.

774
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,360
The doors

775
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,160
are made of very old wood.

776
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,760
Even a rat can't be blocked.

777
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,240
How are we going to hide

778
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,160
inside this palace hall then?

779
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,000
What do we do?

780
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,560
Official,

781
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,720
I remember that you told me

782
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,880
that in this Imperial palace city

783
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,680
in this Imperial palace city

784
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,520
there are dog holes

785
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,720
in several courtyards.

786
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,320
Right.

787
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,440
We also have one here.

788
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:52,862
It's just that the grasses

789
00:41:52,862 --> 00:41:53,760
there are already very high

790
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,080
since no one has been tending to this palace.

791
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,034
Those who doesn't know them

792
00:41:56,034 --> 00:41:56,920
won't even notice them.

793
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:58,960
Let's leave through there then!

794
00:41:59,080 --> 00:41:59,880
Let's leave through the dog hole.

795
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,160
No. No.

796
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,360
Although that dog hole is big,

797
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,440
it can only allow for a person

798
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,240
as small as she

799
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,120
is to pass.

800
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,200
I fear that you all can't fit through.

801
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,520
Child,

802
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,200
whoever can escape, escape first.

803
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,080
Eunuch, please.

804
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:16,720
Father!

805
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,800
You take her out.

806
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,877
Father, I

807
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,280
how could I leave you all behind!

808
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,280
Be obedient.

809
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,280
We are all men here.

810
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,680
If the rebels enter here,

811
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,040
we'll just die!

812
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,360
Quickly leave.

813
00:42:28,425 --> 00:42:29,520
I brought some clothes too.

814
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,160
Go changed.

815
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,000
Brother! Brother!

816
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,120
Leave! Leave! Quickly go!

817
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,200
Brother!

818
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,760
Eunuch,

819
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,600
Eunuch, we will have to trouble you.

820
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,160
Brother!

821
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,040
Go!

822
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:40,840
Please.

823
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,960
What should we do?

824
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,160
Guard the ancient classics well!
