00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,250
The Story of Minglan

2
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,175
Episode 38

3
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,280
Don't look at here

4
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,440
it is nothing right now.

5
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,680
I've placed fertilizer under this.

6
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,275
After a few days,

7
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,375
when we have planted some seeds

8
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:26,235
and there are seedlings,

9
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,400
it will really look good.

10
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,040
With wheat and rice,

11
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,440
the world will be at peace.

12
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,480
No wonder

13
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,480
why a few months ago

14
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,880
His Majesty sent

15
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,320
people to Yuzhou.

16
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,320
So you had them move the plants

17
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,280
to this place.

18
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,240
Once Your Majesty's wheat has been harvested,

19
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,880
bring your family to come here

20
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,080
into the palace

21
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,400
and have a family banquet with us.

22
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,720
Uncle.

23
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,920
What? Is there any difficulty?

24
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,240
Since the General can't bear to eat them,

25
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,760
give this wheat to me then.

26
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,000
I...

27
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,680
I only have these small amount of wheat.

28
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,640
You want some, he also wants some,

29
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,000
I still want to have some for myself.

30
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,520
Your Majesty, just give some to me.

31
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,650
At the very least,

32
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,520
give me enough to fill a few baskets

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,720
to serve as

34
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,720
my wedding gift.

35
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,360
Which lady can be loved

36
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,400
by such a prodigal son?

37
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,080
The legitimate daughter of the Sheng Family.

38
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,480
Sheng Family?

39
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,680
Sheng Family is good. They are scholars.

40
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,640
They can indeed discipline

41
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,280
a wild person like you.

42
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,400
Sure!

43
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,720
I'll grant you a basket of wheat.

44
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,480
Thank you, Your Majesty.

45
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,960
It's been several days.

46
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,750
Minglan is almost

47
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,360
living in her room to convince her.

48
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,080
How come it still doesn't working?

49
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,470
Every day we just deliver her

50
00:03:24,475 --> 00:03:25,120
and simple food,

51
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,720
yet there is no reaction.

52
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,800
If this was in the past,

53
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,360
Ru'er would be begging me already.

54
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,120
How come this time she still didn't give up?

55
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,120
Since she was little, she was never this stubborn.

56
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,560
How about we wait for a few more days?

57
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,040
If we can wait,

58
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,280
can Gu Tingye wait?

59
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,675
I heard that people proposing marriage to him

60
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,075
are surrounding his main gate that

61
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,800
even water can't seep out.

62
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,240
If we kept delaying and not giving him an answer,

63
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,160
he might get annoyed and look for another.

64
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,640
Our Sheng Family not only would have

65
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,320
let a fat lamb like that go,

66
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,080
we will even get horribly laughed at!

67
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,600
When I went out to buy things earlier,

68
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,480
I heard people outside talking about

69
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,520
our marriage with the Gu Family.

70
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,680
How did this matter get out?

71
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,760
I don't know.

72
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,480
We've

73
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,760
warned our servants

74
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,800
to not gossip outside.

75
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,720
Could it be those working of Gu Tingye?

76
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,320
They are mostly barbaric soldiers

77
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,560
so they might

78
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,040
have a slip of the tongue?

79
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,720
What else did they say?

80
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,956
It's the last part that's most important.

81
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,200
Someone said that

82
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,720
His Majesty knew that

83
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,600
he fell love into a lady in our family,

84
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,925
and praised him for his good taste.

85
00:04:39,925 --> 00:04:41,280
His Majesty even grant him marriage.

86
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,120
Grant him marriage?

87
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,760
Miss, it's better to eat something first.

88
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,000
If you continue doing this,

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,320
your health will be threat.

90
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,920
Eat what?

91
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,920
My stomach is full of anger.

92
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,400
How can I eat anything?

93
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,480
Okay.

94
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,560
Stop annoying me.

95
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,400
Get out!

96
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,160
In my opinion,

97
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,800
just listen to Big Madam.

98
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,320
Stop thinking about that Wen...

99
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,560
Are you gonna marry or not!

100
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,400
I'm not! I'm not!

101
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,240
Just beat me to death!

102
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,880
Beat you to death?

103
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,800
If you don't marry,

104
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,800
the Sheng Family will all be dead!

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,040
What?

106
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,520
If I don't marry into the Gu Family,

107
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,240
that Gu Tingye will kill

108
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,960
his way into our family?

109
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,520
The Emperor now knows that

110
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,800
he has come to us to propose marriage!

111
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,265
What?

112
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,320
His Majesty even said that he has great taste

113
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,520
and plans to grant him marriage!

114
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Grant him marriage?

115
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,670
So when an ox won't drink water,

116
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,560
you press its head to make it drink?

117
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,080
It's unreasonable for the Emperor

118
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,480
to force his subjects to get married, right?

119
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,520
Rubbish! You dare to disobey an Imperial decree?

120
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,560
Not only you,

121
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,160
not just our Sheng Family,

122
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,520
even the family of your Eldest Uncle in Youyang,

123
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,250
the family of your Second Uncle

124
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,520
and that of your Fourth Auntie in Hengxi,

125
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,960
our whole Sheng Clan will be executed!

126
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,960
How about...

127
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,920
How about you tell him

128
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,840
that I'm already

129
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,400
engaged with someone else?

130
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,008
His Majesty would never force an engaged woman

131
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,480
into another marriage, right?

132
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,960
What if they ask which family you're engaged with?

133
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,400
We can't let your father

134
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,600
just randomly make up one.

135
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,000
That is a crime of deceiving the Emperor.

136
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,360
It's also punishable.

137
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,480
Then...

138
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,200
Then just casually look for someone

139
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,680
among the juzi for the coming civil examination

140
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,040
to muddle through it.

141
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,080
Oh, right.

142
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,107
A few days ago,

143
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,120
didn't Father

144
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,160
chose one for Fourth Sister?

145
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,560
I heard that Second Brother also saw him

146
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,160
and said that he's not a bad man.

147
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,360
Since he knows our family,

148
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,200
he surely will help complete this lie.

149
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,560
What are you saying?

150
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,920
As an unmarried daughter,

151
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,520
you dare to talk about

152
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,960
finding yourself a fake husband?

153
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,880
Shame on you!

154
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,025
Your father gives importance

155
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:39,640
to his reputation the most.

156
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,760
What will happen if you really do this?

157
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,760
Okay,

158
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,200
even if your father is willing to,

159
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,760
if that Gu Tingye knows that

160
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,280
you'd rather marry a poor juzi

161
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,320
than marry him,

162
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,400
what will he think?

163
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,880
Why would you care about his thought?

164
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,920
This is Gu Tingye!

165
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,240
Don't you know him?

166
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,600
He has been rebellious since he was little!

167
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,840
Even his father...

168
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,440
Now, he's a savior of the previous

169
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,560
and present Emperors.

170
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,875
He has fame and achievements obtained

171
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:08,800
through bloody battles.

172
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,400
You dare to hurt his dignity?

173
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,840
What consequence can you get from that?

174
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,400
Just moving his fingers,

175
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,520
he can kill a poor juzi.

176
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,720
I fear that in the future,

177
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,200
no matter who you marry,

178
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:20,775
it can't be guaranteed

179
00:08:20,775 --> 00:08:21,600
that he won't make life difficult

180
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,040
for your husband and his family.

181
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,520
This person

182
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,760
bears grudges forever.

183
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,560
Okay. Stop crying.

184
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,560
How come my life is this hard.

185
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,280
Once you marry him,

186
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,880
you'll enjoy, glory, splendor, wealth, and fame.

187
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,200
You might even get a conferred title.

188
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,320
Big Madam,

189
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,240
our Miss

190
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,880
is a simple and honest child.

191
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,400
She surely won't harm others for her own benefit

192
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,880
just like that girl from Linqi Pavilion.

193
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,120
Even just for her parents and siblings,

194
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,160
for the Sheng Family,

195
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,560
she will figure it out.

196
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,920
The God really blessed us.

197
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,520
Let me tell you,

198
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,000
when Molan

199
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,360
did that immoral thing,

200
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,500
made all the ladies of our family

201
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,240
to die with her,

202
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,000
and instead got married into a count's family,

203
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,640
I really felt that the heavens were unfair.

204
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,960
My heart was like it was being fried in oil,

205
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,680
I kept being unable to sleep every night.

206
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,760
Now, I know that

207
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,840
the deities

208
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,520
are still guarding me.

209
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,840
Never thought that the marriage of my Rulan

210
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,200
will end up with a marquis' family.

211
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,920
The thought of it makes me so happy.

212
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,040
Big Madam, your hard work has paid off.

213
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,880
Did you have good appetite

214
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,960
and sleep well these days?

215
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,840
Big Madam, you look so happy.

216
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,320
Is there some happy news?

217
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,240
Thanks to the blessing from you,

218
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,000
Old Madam, I'm just about to report it.

219
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,720
It must be about Rulan's marriage, right?

220
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,080
You and your husband

221
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,280
are willing to marry Rulan off to Gu Tingye?

222
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,760
Isn't Rulan against it?

223
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,580
She has been locking herself up

224
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,800
for several days already.

225
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,400
I've tried to convince her for these past days.

226
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,320
She has already agreed.

227
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,960
It's just that she's still a bit shy

228
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,880
and won't come out to see people.

229
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,920
That Gu Family has a complex family situation.

230
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,440
Gu Tingye also has unstable mood swings.

231
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,160
You two have really decided

232
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,120
to marry the spoiled

233
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,560
and straightforward person

234
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,640
Rulan to him?

235
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,160
Everything was just

236
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,120
the leisure of people in the capital.

237
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,850
Changbai has been friends with Gu Tingye

238
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:21,840
for so many years.

239
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,800
He knows his character very well.

240
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,320
Even he says that this man is dependable.

241
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,560
Her elder brother

242
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,175
will never harm

243
00:11:28,175 --> 00:11:29,360
his real little sister, right?

244
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,760
As long as you two are willing to,

245
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,640
I have nothing to say.

246
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,720
Fifth Sister, you really have decided?

247
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,400
Even the Emperor is granting this marriage,

248
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,240
what else can I do?

249
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,200
I'd rather die

250
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,040
than put Brother Jing in danger.

251
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,360
How can there be any danger?

252
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,680
Can I disobey the Imperial decree?

253
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,525
That Gu Tingye seeks vengeance

254
00:12:07,525 --> 00:12:09,000
even against the littlest grudge.

255
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,160
He surely will remember this.

256
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,760
If I don't agree to his proposal,

257
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,080
what if he goes to

258
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,200
bother Brother Jing?

259
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,320
I'd rather marry him

260
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,600
and suffer for a lifetime,

261
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,600
than let him

262
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,200
make the life of Brother Jing difficult.

263
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,440
It won't come to that.

264
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,800
Second Brother has been friends with him

265
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,720
for so many years.

266
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,275
For the sake of him,

267
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,920
he won't do any thing to you.

268
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,120
Second Brother is a scholar.

269
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,600
How could he see through

270
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,600
the facade of a rash soldier?

271
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,000
And you,

272
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,280
he was just able to

273
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:46,920
help you a few times

274
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,080
when you were little.

275
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,200
So many years have passed.

276
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,120
What if he has gotten worse?

277
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,520
That can't be.

278
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,160
That probably isn't so.

279
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,720
He has helped me a lot of times.

280
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,050
To put it plainly,

281
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,800
I'm sparing the rat to save the dishes.

282
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,560
Maybe Gu Tingye is indeed not a person

283
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,240
who holds grudges.

284
00:13:08,605 --> 00:13:09,880
But what if he is?

285
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,280
Brother Jing is a scholar

286
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,350
who doesn't have the physical strength

287
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:13,840
to defend himself,

288
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,280
and he has no power or influence.

289
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,720
How can I allow him

290
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,240
to bully Brother Jing?

291
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,560
Sometimes I wonder..

292
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,560
if we were not humans,

293
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,040
if we were cats or dogs,

294
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,840
bugs or grasses,

295
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,160
we would then be able to life together,

296
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,040
so carefree. How good would that be?

297
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,000
Sometimes,

298
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,760
when I see a cat in the garden,

299
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,720
I envy it so much.

300
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,480
Do you really want him but no one else?

301
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,080
You don't understand.

302
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,960
Let me ask you this.

303
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,000
If you were able to have Brother Yuanruo,

304
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,680
wouldn't you want him?

305
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,520
If I was able to have him, then just forget it.

306
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,240
No. If you really love someone,

307
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,440
it has to be him.

308
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,400
If it's not him,

309
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,160
you won't be able to

310
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,520
sleep or eat.

311
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,720
You miss him when you're sitting,

312
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,400
or when you're walking.

313
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,040
You miss him when you're embroidering flowers,

314
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,240
or when you're playing polo.

315
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,160
When you make teas or light fragrant incense,

316
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,240
you will miss him.

317
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,360
You will always miss him.

318
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,280
Sister,

319
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,600
I really can't understand.

320
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,440
There are so many things happening in this world.

321
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,280
We all should keep looking forward.

322
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,000
You surely will forget him.

323
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,360
I won't ever.

324
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,880
I won't.

325
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,120
Let's think about something happy.

326
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,240
If you marry into the marquis' family,

327
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,040
then you will be several levels

328
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,440
higher than Fourth Sister.

329
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,360
She has to bow to you

330
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,360
when she sees you next time.

331
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,280
Really?

332
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,320
It's true.

333
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
If Second Uncle Gu gets

334
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,280
some high official position or noble title,

335
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,640
you might even also get a conferred title,

336
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:26,320
Fourth Sister then

337
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,120
won't be able to catch up with you

338
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,040
even if she fawns forever.

339
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,160
That is indeed

340
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,280
a comforting thing.

341
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,840
It's the only one now.

342
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,280
Big Madam will be very happy.

343
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:45,800
How come my mother

344
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,360
can be this ruthless?

345
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,050
Just pushing me towards

346
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:51,080
the fiery pit like this.

347
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,760
My Brother Jing...

348
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,640
What do you think

349
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,120
Brother Jing is doing right now?

350
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,760
I heard that here in Yuqing Monastery,

351
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,450
there are magnolia during spring

352
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,440
and chrysanthemum during autumn.

353
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,400
Let's go take a look.

354
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,880
You're usually

355
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,890
busy all day.

356
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,080
How come you have the idle time today

357
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,360
to enjoy autumn flowers?

358
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,080
If there is a beautiful one,

359
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,440
I'll pick it

360
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,200
so you can take it

361
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,360
as a gift to your sister.

362
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,680
Let's go.

363
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,000
Did you see that?

364
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,000
When I said that I'm getting married,

365
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,920
the light on the oil lantern

366
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,840
kept flickering.

367
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,880
It feels as if my mother

368
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,600
in heaven is happy for me.

369
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,000
This is just the start.

370
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,520
There are still good days ahead.

371
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,240
It always me being the older brother

372
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,400
and you being the younger one.

373
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,800
But in a few days,

374
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,760
I must call you elder brother instead.

375
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,640
It doesn't

376
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,000
feel good.

377
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,880
Doesn't feel good?

378
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,720
Let's just forget about this marriage then.

379
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,040
Forget it!

380
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,960
What are you saying?

381
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,400
As long as I'm able to marry your sister,

382
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,360
even if I get to be demoted

383
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,400
to a generation below you, I'm willing.

384
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,160
Okay. Okay.

385
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,720
I finally know

386
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,840
you are sincere.

387
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,960
Indeed. Indeed.

388
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,160
Looks like the two of us

389
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,760
don't have the fate to be together.

390
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,760
There.

391
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,280
Someone is crying.

392
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,160
Could someone have encountered some problem?

393
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,760
I can't let the Sheng family down,

394
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,920
so I can only let you down.

395
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,240
The Sheng Family?

396
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,040
Young Master!

397
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,200
How dare you!

398
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:29,800
What are you looking at?

399
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,240
Go back! Go back!

400
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,200
What's going on?

401
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,800
Zhonghuai! Zhonghuai! Zhonghuai!

402
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,440
T-This...

403
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,560
You...

404
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,200
Come home with me!

405
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,480
You shameless beast.

406
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,960
You...What are you doing?

407
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,960
What am I doing?

408
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,200
I'm going to kill her!

409
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,840
The whole family should die with her!

410
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,040
Cry. You only know how to cry.

411
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,160
I initially thought that

412
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,680
you're different from Molan.

413
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,600
Never thought that you would do this

414
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,160
kind of indecent scandal!

415
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,560
You even got discovered!

416
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,480
Tell me, what's the point of your living?

417
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,080
It's better that you just die!

418
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,680
They are eloping

419
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,760
or

420
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,840
Grandmother, of course not.

421
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,440
Fifth Sister

422
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,080
is a kind and honest person.

423
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,800
This marriage is known by the Emperor.

424
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,760
She is willing for this marriage.

425
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,040
She just went to say her farewell,

426
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,320
but coincidentally,

427
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,920
that Gu Tingye also thought about

428
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,320
telling his mother

429
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,280
the news of his wedding.

430
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,760
He invited my husband to light some incense

431
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,520
and accidentally bumped into them.

432
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,720
This is also just bad luck.

433
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:10,960
Then..

434
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,120
what's going on in Weiruixuan?

435
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,480
Father tried to strangle Fifth Little Sister

436
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,720
with a white cloth.

437
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,080
Her maid servant

438
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,000
also got flogged.

439
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,120
But all this can't solve anything.

440
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,800
I heard that Gu Tingye

441
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,120
didn't say anything and just left.

442
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,040
Don't really know

443
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,600
what he will do once he gets mad.

444
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,360
Although Gu Tingye is a military warrior,

445
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,650
he is also an educated person

446
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,800
who is steeped with propriety.

447
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,880
Moreover, if this matter gets out,

448
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,080
his reputation will also get tarnished.

449
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,960
And given his relationship with Changbai,

450
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,160
I'm guessing that...

451
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,560
he won't turn hostile against us.

452
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,160
But this matter with Fifth Little Sister

453
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,680
is known to the Emperor.

454
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,040
If it didn't push through,

455
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,120
he surely will inquire.

456
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,760
With Fifth Little Sister doing a thing like that,

457
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,075
even if my husband begs for leniency

458
00:20:58,075 --> 00:20:58,800
for the sake of their friendship,

459
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,280
I fear that Gu Tingye will still not agree.

460
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,480
Moreover,

461
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,400
if this matter gets out,

462
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,160
our family will then...

463
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,525
Last time,

464
00:21:08,525 --> 00:21:09,880
when Molan caused such great trouble,

465
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,360
I was able to convince the Liang Family

466
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,800
based on my background.

467
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,520
But the Gu Family

468
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,320
is being administered by a stepmother.

469
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,320
She and Gu Tingye are also at odds right now.

470
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,925
Even if I want to use my background again

471
00:21:23,925 --> 00:21:25,360
and obtain their understanding,

472
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,880
I'm afraid it won't work.

473
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
Miss!

474
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,040
How is she?

475
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,800
Sister Xique has been beaten so badly.

476
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,160
I heard that Fifth Miss pounced on her body

477
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,200
and suffered some of the flogging,

478
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,200
Xique was able to preserve her life.

479
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,520
I already give all the good medicines

480
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,480
we have to them.

481
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,320
Then, how about now?

482
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,800
What else did you find out?

483
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,680
Weiruixuan is being sealed like some iron barrel.

484
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,440
No one is allowed to enter or leave.

485
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,160
So scary.

486
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,680
I heard from Sister Yanghao that

487
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,960
Second Brother has already

488
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,200
delivered a letter to the Gu Family

489
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,240
on behalf of the Master tonight.

490
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,600
I don't know what he wrote in that letter.

491
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,760
That Gu Tingye!

492
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,000
He's really a calamity star!

493
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,040
Anyone who associates with him

494
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,040
will get in trouble.

495
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,440
Actually,

496
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,120
Fifth Sister just wanted to

497
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,160
to bid someone farewell

498
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,240
and have some closure.

499
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,080
How come it would be so unlucky that

500
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,240
he just happened to...

501
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,720
bump into them?

502
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,800
Even if Father's words

503
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,880
are sincere than everything,

504
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,080
it won't help.

505
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,280
No matter how you look at it,

506
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,320
this situation is hopeless.

507
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,520
It can't be resolved.

508
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,475
In my opinion,

509
00:22:36,475 --> 00:22:37,760
we can't blame him either.

510
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,240
Misses in our family are all

511
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,960
willful and bold like this.

512
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,200
The one who will suffer the misfortune

513
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:42,680
will still be you.

514
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,720
What if the He family...

515
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,520
If the He family

516
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,400
don't want me because of this matter,

517
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,040
just let them be.

518
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,480
Anyway,

519
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,880
I'm not interested in marriage.

520
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,160
I'll just listen to Grandmother.

521
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:00,125
Listen to the plans of the heavens

522
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:00,650
and where my fate takes me.

523
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,600
Don't even think about it!

524
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,440
And you are even her father.

525
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,680
You dare come up with an idea like that!

526
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,960
What kind of person is that Gu Tingye?

527
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,360
You're going to fool him?

528
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,680
Can he accommodate any flaws in his eyes?

529
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,760
Mother,

530
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,880
we really have no choice.

531
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,720
Yesterday, I already asked Changbai to

532
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,480
discuss with Second Young Master Gu

533
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,320
the matter of canceling the marriage.

534
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,840
Second Gu is actually easy to talk to.

535
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,600
Based on he and Changbai

536
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,000
having some friendship,

537
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,520
even the marriage is canceled,

538
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,360
people will just talk some gossip about him.

539
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,120
Maybe the lofty ones

540
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,320
will even admire us for not connecting with

541
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,560
a newly-favored noble?

542
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,800
But Second Gu said

543
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,120
that this marriage

544
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,800
has already been set in front of His Majesty.

545
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,600
Then...

546
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,800
will His Majesty hold a blade

547
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,080
and force my granddaughter to marry?

548
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,920
Go tell them

549
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,290
that my Minglan has expressed her wish

550
00:24:09,305 --> 00:24:10,760
to become a nun!

551
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,120
Mother.

552
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,240
Mother.

553
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,200
Second Gu only announced that

554
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,500
he's marrying the legitimate daughter

555
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,160
of our Sheng Family.

556
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,520
He didn't give any name.

557
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,480
Minglan has already been registered under me.

558
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,920
She's also considered to be a legitimate daughter.

559
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:28,625
We just need to announce to the public that

560
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:31,345
it's Minglan who is marrying sto the Gu Family,

561
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,400
Rulan is agreed to be married into the Wen Family.

562
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,280
This way, both our families...

563
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,520
Oh wait, the three families will all look good.

564
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,000
You..!

565
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,760
You wish!

566
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,440
You...

567
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,160
As the Big Madam,

568
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,280
you never thought about Ming'er

569
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,120
if there were any good things.

570
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,520
When there are any noble families coming to ask,

571
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,000
you only mention Ru'er!

572
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,360
Now that a problem has occurred,

573
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,240
you remember Ming'er!

574
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,200
You two,

575
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,960
One is extremely selfish.

576
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,840
Only thinking about her own birth daughter.

577
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,120
The other one

578
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,760
is blinded by greed!

579
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,760
Only thinks about position and wealth!

580
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,760
You are a pair of dangerous beasts,

581
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,320
evil couple!

582
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,800
Thinking of stealing Ming'er away from me?

583
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,120
Not unless you kill me with one stroke!

584
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,360
Mother! Mother, you're right to scold us!

585
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,960
But no matter what,

586
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,040
you should consider

587
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,440
Hua'er's reputation!

588
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,840
Hua'er's days with her in-laws

589
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,000
are already not good.

590
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:46,800
Good thing,

591
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,160
her husband is still quite considerate.

592
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,320
But her husband is currently working

593
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,400
under Gu Tingye.

594
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,900
If this matter doesn't end well,

595
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,120
then...what if Gu Tingye

596
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,440
vents his anger on her husband?

597
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,760
What will Hua'er do?

598
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,040
Hua'er also

599
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,880
grew up by your side.

600
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,800
You can't just dote

601
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,240
on that girl Ming!

602
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,680
Last time, when that damn rascal caused trouble,

603
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,400
you all also wanted me to consider Hua'er.

604
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,840
Now that Ru'er brought trouble,

605
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,880
I still have to consider Hua'er!

606
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,440
Hua'er has such a huge reputation.

607
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,920
She's after all officially wed

608
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,120
into the count's family.

609
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:29,880
Will they dare to divorce her

610
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,480
and send her back to us?

611
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,280
Must we sacrifice the future of her little sister

612
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,480
just to make her feel better?

613
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,150
You all call Hua'er

614
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,790
to see me and I'll ask her myself.

615
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,720
I think she dotes on Ming'er

616
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,520
more than you two.

617
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:56,575
Mother,

618
00:26:56,575 --> 00:26:57,680
you said earlier that

619
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,600
I should just tell His Majesty

620
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,920
that Ming'er is going to be a nun.

621
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,475
Those words are tantamount to the crime

622
00:27:05,475 --> 00:27:06,360
of deceiving the Emperor.

623
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,800
I, your son, dare not do that.

624
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,000
If you think this matter can be easily resolved,

625
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,440
I'll then write you a letter requesting an audience

626
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,160
with His Majesty

627
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,910
and you just go there to explain it on my behalf.

628
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,240
You!

629
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,600
You!

630
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,200
You!

631
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,120
Old Madam, stop being mad.

632
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,720
Old Madam,

633
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,720
drink some ginseng soup and calm your anger.

634
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,440
Don't panic yet.

635
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,760
Let Grandmother come up with an idea.

636
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,520
The marriage between you

637
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,240
and the He Family is almost finalized.

638
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,360
I know we are wrong of doing this.

639
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,520
Did Second Brother hear it wrong?

640
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,320
Gu Tingye...

641
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,000
Gu Tingye wants to marry me?

642
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,280
He can't be wrong. It's true.

643
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,920
Please let me through.

644
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,040
Excuse me.

645
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,160
Young Master!

646
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,480
Your name is over there!

647
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,640
It's a pass! Young Master passed!

648
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,240
I passed! I passed!

649
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,000
Thirteenth place!

650
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,320
I passed!

651
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,160
I passed!

652
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,200
Thanks.

653
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,000
Mother! Mother!

654
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,800
I passed!

655
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,760
Okay. Okay. This is great.

656
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,200
You finally

657
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,400
didn't study in vain.

658
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,560
Our Qi Family finally

659
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,560
has some celebratory news.

660
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,920
Go ask the Duke to return home.

661
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,000
Hang red lanterns and light the firecrackers.

662
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,000
Mother, don't be busy with that first.

663
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,480
I'll instruct

664
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,000
the servants to handle those matters.

665
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,680
There is one thing now that

666
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,720
I want to beg Mother to do.

667
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,880
Mother, I...

668
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,200
I understand.

669
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,680
I understand.

670
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,280
It's all my fault.

671
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,440
I made you get married just for a few months

672
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,200
and become a widower.

673
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:01,800
Now,

674
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,960
you have an achievement.

675
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,000
If we go propose marriage this time,

676
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,680
it won't be aggrieving Minglan.

677
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,960
I will go take a bath and change my clothes now.

678
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,200
I'll go to the Sheng Family

679
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,360
and settle this marriage.

680
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,000
This is snowflake wine that

681
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,600
your brother-in-law personally made.

682
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,200
Have a taste.

683
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,600
With rusty leaf garjan as the main ingredient,

684
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,480
costus root as accompaniment.

685
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,600
You feel very refreshed after drinking it.

686
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,200
It is indeed worthy of its name, snowflake wine.

687
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,800
Big Madam!

688
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,800
Big Madam, we have a problem.

689
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,840
Why are you being panicky?

690
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,560
Young Master kept crying.

691
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,720
No one could make him stop.

692
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,600
His nanny already went to see him but failed.

693
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,400
Big Madam, please have a look.

694
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,800
What's wrong with Shi'er? I'll go too.

695
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,280
Don't bother,

696
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,920
They are just exaggerating.

697
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,120
Sit down and eat.

698
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,240
It's fine.

699
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,560
Let's go.

700
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,560
How come Eldest Miss

701
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,400
not letting you see your nephew?

702
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,720
Eldest Sister of course has her reason.

703
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,720
Xiaotao.

704
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,160
Have a taste.

705
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,925
The cooking and flavoring of the fish

706
00:32:49,925 --> 00:32:50,670
was really done well.

707
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,080
It's just that the fish is not that good.

708
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,920
If you want live fish,

709
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,320
I'll go catch you a few

710
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,440
from the Youyang River!

711
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,560
So, Eldest Sister also invited you.

712
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,000
Why can't your Eldest Sister invite me?

713
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,520
Technically speaking,

714
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,440
I'm even your brother-in-law's superior.

715
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,915
I cam here to visit

716
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,120
my little nephew and niece.

717
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,520
This is also just normal human behavior.

718
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,960
My nephew is currently crying.

719
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,320
You should go take a look.

720
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,720
Let's finish our chat first before going.

721
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,400
I have nothing to say to Second Uncle Gu.

722
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,040
Say, we're about to marry.

723
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,360
stop calling me Second Uncle.

724
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,840
I'm not agreeing to it!

725
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,040
My grandmother has also not agreed yet.

726
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,840
This thing might not push through.

727
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,280
Angry now?

728
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,360
Are you angry?

729
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,760
I know that you are angry,

730
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,840
Sixth Miss.

731
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,280
But I feel that this matter

732
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,600
should be discussed out in the open.

733
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,240
Keeping it to yourself isn't a good idea.

734
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,625
Sincerely treating each other

735
00:34:15,625 --> 00:34:16,760
is the proper principle.

736
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,250
Speaking the truth to a person

737
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:24,960
who speaks the truth

738
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,240
is what we call treating each other sincerely.

739
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,160
Telling the truth to a person who's lying

740
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,520
is called being stupid like a pig.

741
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,080
You think I'm stupid?

742
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,200
How sure are you that I'm not telling the truth?

743
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,000
This...from where should we start?

744
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:37,750
Let's start

745
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,120
when you proposed marriage to our family.

746
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,360
You didn't plan to

747
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,880
marry my Fifth Sister from the beginning.

748
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,800
You are targeting me, am I right?

749
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,440
You were able to get that!

750
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,120
You are indeed the person I want.

751
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:54,880
I only guessed it

752
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,040
when you came here today.

753
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,000
But it's too late.

754
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,400
Our whole Sheng Family

755
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,600
has fallen to your devious trap.

756
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:06,960
Last time,

757
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,400
I saved you from the river.

758
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,240
What?

759
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,840
I saved you,

760
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,560
and you gave me a piece of advice.

761
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,400
You told me to stop wandering

762
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,600
and give Rong'er a home.

763
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,240
Since that moment,

764
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,240
I decided

765
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,880
to marry you as my wife.

766
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,600
That was a matchmaker.

767
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,480
Could that person be here

768
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,120
to propose marriage?

769
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,040
Looking at him,

770
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,480
he seems to be just a normal scholar.

771
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,920
How could he compare to our Young Lord?

772
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,120
Big Madam, don't worry.

773
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,040
Indeed.

774
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,080
You say that you want to marry me.

775
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,160
You could just directly propose marriage.

776
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,040
Why go around in such a big circle?

777
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,000
Just for this matter,

778
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,560
my Fifth Sister almost lost her life.

779
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,520
If I directly go propose,

780
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,800
will your grandmother agree?

781
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,600
It's not easy to agree to a marriage proposal,

782
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,840
but rejecting one

783
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,880
is so easy.

784
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,480
All kinds of reasons

785
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,100
can be used as an excuse.

786
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,440
Moreover,

787
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,960
my character before was indeed dishonorable.

788
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,440
Your Old Madam has a very strong personality.

789
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,240
If she insists on refusing,

790
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,360
I fear that your father

791
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,025
won't be able to do anything about it either.

792
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,640
You know yourself quite well.

793
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,120
It's good for a person to know himself well.

794
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,560
Do you know about the matter about the He family?

795
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,680
My grandmother already agreed...

796
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,840
Already agreed to their proposal.

797
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,920
If you know, why did you still propose marriage?

798
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,375
Do you even know the feudal ethical codes

799
00:37:11,375 --> 00:37:12,000
and moral principles?

800
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,360
It's your family's matter to marry off the ladies

801
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,520
in your family to whoever.

802
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,400
It's my matter to propose marriage or not.

803
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,225
Why must there be a need

804
00:37:19,225 --> 00:37:20,680
for feudal ethical codes or moral principles?

805
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,640
Moreover,

806
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,840
even if your older brother knows this,

807
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,000
he won't comment much.

808
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,500
You and the He family

809
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,720
are not fated to be together!

810
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,200
If you didn't interfere,

811
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,640
we're already being together!

812
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,960
Because there is that Cousin Cao.

813
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,300
And thus,

814
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,600
you two can't be together.

815
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,120
You also know about her?

816
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,520
How could I not know?

817
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,440
You also arranged this?

818
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,920
How is that possible?

819
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,600
Since I returned to the capital,

820
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,800
I've been asking around

821
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,640
for news regarding your family.

822
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,100
I also know that your grandmother,

823
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:03,680
Old Madam Sheng,

824
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,360
is very close with the Old Madam of the He family.

825
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,600
That He Hongwen

826
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,160
also frequently visits your family.

827
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,840
In my heart,

828
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,440
I understood it more or less.

829
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,080
Afterwards,

830
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,640
His Majesty asked me to fight a war for him.

831
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,720
I couldn't have time to handle this matter.

832
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,760
I then can only think of

833
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,880
a way to deal with He Hongwen.

834
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,400
Afterwards,

835
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,240
I heard that He Hongwen

836
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,000
has a female cousin he grew up with,

837
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,480
and she's even been exiled.

838
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,800
That night,

839
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,600
I was so happy that I couldn't sleep!

840
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,480
So then, the Cao Family got pardoned.

841
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,360
The parents of that Cao cousin

842
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,640
married her

843
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,480
to a sergeant.

844
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,520
That family refused to let her go.

845
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,280
They cried and fought

846
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,400
to not let their family

847
00:39:05,475 --> 00:39:07,160
enter the list of those pardoned families.

848
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,560
I used some money

849
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,120
to buy her freedom.

850
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,120
Let someone instruct their family

851
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,080
not to return to their home province

852
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,840
and directly return to the capital.

853
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,840
That Cao little sister

854
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,480
didn't disappoint me.

855
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,800
She pestered He Hongwen to the point that

856
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,880
he's unable to escape her grasp!

857
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,480
I was able to have time

858
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,840
to be focused in fighting my battles.

859
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,375
In just ten to fifteen days after the pardon,

860
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,375
the Cao family already arrived here

861
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:35,760
in the capital.

862
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:37,920
Only you

863
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,280
could have done that.

864
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,920
That's right.

865
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,680
The Canal Gang transports goods.

866
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,280
Then in transporting people,

867
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,120
wouldn't it be a piece of cake?

868
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,000
Princess of the Second Rank, this...

869
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,040
You could just come.

870
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,080
no need to bring so many things.

871
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,520
Are your husband and Young Lord doing well?

872
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,160
They're doing okay.

873
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,280
Yesterday, Yuanruo went to look at the results

874
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,960
and was able to pass the civil examination.

875
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,320
It's all thanks to

876
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,120
his studying days in your family.

877
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,920
Shouldn't I bring some items

878
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,240
to show our gratitude?

879
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,800
In a few days,

880
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,000
we're holding a banquet in our family.

881
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,440
Hope you and your family

882
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,480
can come and celebrate with us.

883
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,480
I indeed should congratulate you

884
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,800
and Duke of the State.

885
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,040
But,

886
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,280
I can only thank you for the invitation.

887
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,760
Recently, our family is quite busy.

888
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,325
We have to prepare for the weddings

889
00:40:43,325 --> 00:40:44,240
of my two daughters.

890
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,520
We really won't be able to go out.

891
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,080
Two daughters?

892
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,240
Yes.

893
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,400
Talking about marriage fate,

894
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,250
it can be as far as the horizon or as near

895
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:56,120
as being in front of you.

896
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,120
Before, we couldn't find any prospect.

897
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,080
Suddenly,

898
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,520
these two daughters both finds someone.

899
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,480
It's a happy but also tiring.

900
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,840
Minglan's marriage has also been settled?

901
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,720
Which family is it?

902
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,280
Princess, you haven't heard?

903
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,465
Isn't it already known

904
00:41:18,475 --> 00:41:20,115
throughout Bianjing?

905
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:21,920
She is to marry

906
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,520
that Second Young Master Gu

907
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,280
who pacified the unrest in the west.

908
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,360
Gu Tingye?

909
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,600
Isn't he set to marry Rulan?

910
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,320
Everyone is saying that he's marrying

911
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,640
the legitimate daughter of the Sheng Family.

912
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,640
When Minglan returned

913
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,360
to our home province in Youyang,

914
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,160
Old Madam has already decided

915
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,000
to put her under my family.

916
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,880
Hence, she can be considered to be

917
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,280
the legitimate daughter.

918
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Then... Second Gu has agreed?

919
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,800
Why wouldn't he?

920
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,240
Although he's a favored subject by His Majesty

921
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,480
and a just a new appointee,

922
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,040
he's very sensible and reasonable.

923
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,760
He's unlike other people

924
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,240
who are too bothered by details.

925
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,360
He also never looked down upon

926
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,325
his future father-in-law

927
00:42:12,325 --> 00:42:13,520
as just a fifth-rank official.

928
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,760
He even said that

929
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,960
he looks down on those opportunists.

930
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,800
When they see someone getting into power,

931
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,325
they will pound at him

932
00:42:20,325 --> 00:42:21,080
like a fly smelling some stink.

933
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,760
Our family has always been loyal and devoted,

934
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,320
not moved by honor or disgrace.

935
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,320
We are much stronger than those people

936
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,720
who only know how to

937
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,850
climb social ladder, currying people of power

938
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:32,680
and step on those who are not.

939
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,920
To say something that

940
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,880
shouldn't be revealed to outsiders,

941
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,440
it was even Gu Tingye

942
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,320
who personally came to our family

943
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,120
and mentioned this marriage to my son.

944
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,950
After hearing that Rulan has been set

945
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:45,640
to marry someone else,

946
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,280
he immediately said that Ming'er is fine too.

947
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,425
As long as it's a Sheng daughter,

948
00:42:48,425 --> 00:42:49,520
she surely would be a good lady.

949
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,480
This son-in-law

950
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,520
is really quite a nice lad.

951
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,080
He can talk and can do things.

952
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,600
You can say that

953
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,125
our family has endured a long time

954
00:43:00,125 --> 00:43:01,400
and finally turned into gold,

955
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:03,240
having some good days after long suffering.

956
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,680
Princess,

957
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,840
stay here and have dinner with us.

958
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,760
Big Madam, no need to be so courteous.

959
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,240
It's getting late.

960
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,960
I'll go greet Old Madam

961
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,000
and will return to my manor.

962
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,750
There are still some matters at home

963
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:21,440
that I must handle.

964
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,200
I'll just go home.
