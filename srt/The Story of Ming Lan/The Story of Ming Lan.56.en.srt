00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Ming Lan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,580
Episode 56

3
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,440
Slow down. Slow down.

4
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:08,880
Move.

5
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,920
Left. Left.

6
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,440
We're not going to Jiaxi House. Go to my study.

7
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:15,680
Marquis,

8
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,760
why go to the study?

9
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,120
Go to the study!

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,400
Marquis, you got injured so badly.

11
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,680
If you don't let Big Madam see it,

12
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:23,880
won't you

13
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,320
have suffered in vain?

14
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,880
Let her see?

15
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,280
For what then?

16
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,080
I won't let her see it!

17
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,560
Go to the study.

18
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,509
Study. Study.

19
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,560
Slowly.

20
00:01:36,051 --> 00:01:37,691
Slow down! Slow down!

21
00:01:46,252 --> 00:01:47,492
Did you hear it clearly?

22
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,560
Quite clearly.

23
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,440
Shitou said that Marquis was beaten

24
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,750
to a bloody pulp.

25
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,360
The wound in his chest has just healed.

26
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,480
How could he get injured again?

27
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:02,861
Big Madam.

28
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,720
Who is it?

29
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,800
It's me. It's me.

30
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,880
So, you're here.

31
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,840
How come the doctor isn't here yet?

32
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,320
Even for all the doctors in this world,

33
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,400
they are no match for my adhesive surgical plaster.

34
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,320
Just then,

35
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,400
Shitou has dressed the wound.

36
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,760
Marquis,

37
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,240
just stay at home and rest for the next few days.

38
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,450
Recuperate from the wound

39
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,640
and skip the court then.

40
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,400
Wife, I'm in so much pain.

41
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:15,040
Then...

42
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,000
I'll use the fan to make you feel cooler.

43
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,400
You'll not be that painful then.

44
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,120
Wife,

45
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,560
I really feel better now.

46
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:42,040
But the part with no wound is also cold.

47
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,200
Then I'll get some ice.

48
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,400
It's okay. I'm fine now.

49
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,280
It won't hurt anymore with some ice.

50
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,560
Why are you getting ice?!

51
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,400
Wife, don't get them anymore.

52
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,120
Ice can stop the pain.

53
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,960
I can't really apply it for the whole day, right?

54
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,880
It will still ache later,

55
00:03:59,881 --> 00:04:00,600
right?

56
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,200
Why must you do this?

57
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,200
Look at this, this injury of mine,

58
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,680
it wasn't in vain.

59
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,040
I'll go to the ice cellar and get you some ice.

60
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,280
Wife!

61
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,480
Oh, Wife...

62
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,000
Just lie down properly!

63
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,320
Shitou!

64
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,400
Go.

65
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,240
Go and get me some ice from the ice cellar.

66
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,160
Okay.

67
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,120
Quickly just lie down properly.

68
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,280
Wife, don't worry.

69
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,360
I'm not worried.

70
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,160
These matters

71
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,960
are just political conflicts.

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,880
I just unitedly stood

73
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,920
on the side of His Majesty.

74
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,800
It looks kind of scary,

75
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,920
but it's really nothing.

76
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,560
My joints and bones aren't harmed.

77
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,880
It will be fine in a few days.

78
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,640
Your eyes...

79
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,040
why do your eyes look red?

80
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,400
They're fine.

81
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,640
Just like those of rabbits.

82
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,280
Nonsense！

83
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,880
Empress Dowager.

84
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,640
All of you, leave now.

85
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:43,920
Say it.

86
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,920
Eunuch Li went out the palace for purchase.

87
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,160
Third Young Master of Gu

88
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,280
just followed him.

89
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,360
I got it.

90
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,600
Noble Consort Liu is currently

91
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,800
accompanying His Majesty

92
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,160
in a stroll around the garden.

93
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,720
There's no need to worry

94
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,960
about Eunuch Li.

95
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,200
You should think about that

96
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,624
what Noble Consort Liu

97
00:06:12,624 --> 00:06:14,400
would be talking with His Majesty now.

98
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,720
You are indeed the Emperor,

99
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,240
but also my husband,

100
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,080
and that of the Empress.

101
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,280
You are also the father of your children,

102
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,360
and the son of your father.

103
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,240
Before you became the Emperor,

104
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,300
I had been living

105
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,280
in a simple house and ugly alleys then.

106
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,960
But I've never heard that

107
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,800
anyone would meddle in

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,925
the private affairs

109
00:06:35,925 --> 00:06:37,000
of other families.

110
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,320
You think that

111
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,760
I should call him Royal Father?

112
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,960
As for the address,

113
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,160
Your Majesty,

114
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,960
it's all your own private matter.

115
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,400
Only you

116
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,840
can comfort me.

117
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,500
Emperor Dowager,

118
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,600
Prime Minister Han is seeking for an audience.

119
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,520
He still dared to see me?

120
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,680
Tell him to leave!

121
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,040
Yes.

122
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,680
Wait.

123
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,880
Hey, come here.

124
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,360
Just tell him to wait outside,

125
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,080
for I'm ill from severe anger.

126
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,680
and unable to get up.

127
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,240
Empress Dowager was so mad that she can't breathe,

128
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,680
and is currently resting.

129
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,560
If you have

130
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,680
any other things to do,

131
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,440
you'd better attend to them first.

132
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,800
If Empress Dowager is sick,

133
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,400
I won't disturb her.

134
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,640
May she just give her approval

135
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,720
and write a decree.

136
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,840
I will then leave.

137
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,760
Lord,

138
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,600
we've completed the purchases.

139
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,760
We can go back anytime.

140
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,280
Okay.

141
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,960
You all take a rest outside.

142
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,520
We'll leave once everyone's full.

143
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,520
Yes.

144
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,280
Official Li!

145
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,175
Looking from the outside,

146
00:08:33,175 --> 00:08:34,480
it just looks like you.

147
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,600
It's indeed you then.

148
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,760
Official Gu,

149
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,225
I just came out for purchasing,

150
00:08:41,225 --> 00:08:42,320
and I'm about to leave.

151
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,480
I don't even have any official job.

152
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,960
How could it be official?

153
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,040
It's hard to bump into each other out here.

154
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,760
Why don't we have a few drinks before you leave?

155
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,080
There are urgent matters in the palace.

156
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,120
Please forgive me.

157
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,040
Official! Official!

158
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,960
Today, my older brother

159
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,560
got reprimanded in court.

160
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,000
Was His Majesty offended?

161
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,650
Marquis Gu

162
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,400
has always been deeply favored by His Majesty.

163
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,800
Even if he does any improper acts,

164
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,360
His Majesty won't be mad.

165
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,200
Okay. That's good.

166
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,080
It's just that...

167
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,000
It's just that?

168
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,680
It's also natural

169
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,120
for Empress Dowager to be mad sometimes.

170
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,520
But Empress Dowager is the lord,

171
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,360
and Marquis is just a courtier.

172
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,040
I'm sure that Marquis

173
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,750
won't bear any grudge

174
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,760
against Empress Dowager, right?

175
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,440
Official, we won't definitely!

176
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,400
You've said it too seriously.

177
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,200
I just fear of Empress Dowager's discomfort,

178
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,360
which makes the whole marquis manor uneasy.

179
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,040
We only wish to loyally serve

180
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,080
and unburden the worries of Empress Dowager.

181
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,600
It's fine. It's fine.

182
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,040
Third, take care!

183
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,360
I'll take my leave then.

184
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,360
Official, let me walk you out.

185
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,040
Based on what Eunuch Li said,

186
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,840
it doesn't seem to be a big problem.

187
00:10:04,734 --> 00:10:07,254
Among his words, "it's just that"

188
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,120
bears a greater meaning.

189
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,480
Or else, how come you say one thing,

190
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,000
and he just have to say another?

191
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,925
Empress Dowager and His Majesty are not united.

192
00:10:16,925 --> 00:10:18,800
Everyone knows that.

193
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,200
Even Second Brother got caned by Empress Dowager.

194
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,600
So Empress Dowager is bearing grudges.

195
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,920
Isn't it quite clear?

196
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,840
If it's very clear,

197
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,040
why bother saying it?

198
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,080
I'm thinking...he just want to swindle us?

199
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,800
It's quite easy for him to get money.

200
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,720
Why must he use a few words to swindle you?

201
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,560
Go. Go. Go.

202
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,320
Go back to the library and study more.

203
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,440
What does this get to do with studying?

204
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,520
What do you think?

205
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,120
When Young Master asked about the Emperor,

206
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,550
Officer Li could have just

207
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,560
answered about the Emperor.

208
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,360
How come he mentioned the Empress Dowager then?

209
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,880
He mentioned Empress Dowager

210
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,160
to scare Third Young Master firstly,

211
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,300
but then said that everything's fine

212
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,160
and there's still a chance.

213
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,400
Previously, it was Eunuch Zhu.

214
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,160
Now, it's Eunuch Li.

215
00:11:14,566 --> 00:11:16,600
One works for the Empress Dowager,

216
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,360
while the other for His Majesty.

217
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,400
But what they said were completely the same.

218
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,040
It then means that they are linked together.

219
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,240
Even you could notice the intention

220
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,560
of Eunuch Li

221
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,360
in seeking Tingwei expressively,

222
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,160
but he just couldn't see it.

223
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,360
We must act faster.

224
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,600
There's no more time.

225
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,800
Or else, we will die from this slow cooking.

226
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,440
That stupid son of mine

227
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,360
would also get manipulated.

228
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,440
They are being so unruly.

229
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,200
I'll drive them away now.

230
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,320
Prime Minister Han

231
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,800
will not go back willingly

232
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,280
without my written decree.

233
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,320
Since they all want it,

234
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,160
then I'll write His Majesty a decree

235
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,280
or favoring his birth family.

236
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,560
Not only can he acknowledge him as father,

237
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,200
but also as an emperor.

238
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,475
Confer his birth mother and illegitimate mothers

239
00:12:25,475 --> 00:12:26,400
as empresses.

240
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,950
Empress Dowager, are you really

241
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,320
backing down to His Majesty?

242
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,000
Let's end it.

243
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,840
Inform the Imperial Kitchen

244
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,280
that the Prime Minister is here.

245
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,600
I'll treat him with good dishes.

246
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,560
This was what His Majesty wants.

247
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,800
But as the Empress Dowager

248
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,720
was going to have you beaten,

249
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,240
why didn't he stand out and stop it?

250
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,760
Well, now,

251
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,240
you can't even eat properly.

252
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,400
Since it was His Majesty's intention,

253
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,480
why would he stop it?

254
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,000
Now that you're broken and had to stay at home,

255
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,880
he would have lost help in the imperial court.

256
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,120
Except me in the morning court,

257
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,360
there are still Xiao Geng

258
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,560
and State Uncle.

259
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,800
Previously, when Prime Minister Han

260
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,050
mentioned this matter of addressing

261
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,280
Prince Shu as Royal Father,

262
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,200
His Majesty pressed it down.

263
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,200
Now things have become like this

264
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,280
because that His Majesty and Empress Dowager,

265
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,280
they both can't endure it any longer.

266
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,000
Couldn't you just keep silent on this?

267
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,920
I...

268
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,120
have inherited this marquis title.

269
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,200
With His Majesty's writing,

270
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,800
I traveled from Yuzhou

271
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,000
to rescue the Late Emperor.

272
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,000
Who would believe that I'm impartial?

273
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,720
Even if I keep silent,

274
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,560
His Majesty and Empress Dowager

275
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,880
would naturally help me choose my side.

276
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,800
But being adopted means that

277
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,000
you're using other people's surname,

278
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,800
inheriting other people's assets,

279
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,240
eating other people's food,

280
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,320
and enjoying other people's blessings.

281
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,400
If one day, you become powerful

282
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,960
and you abandon the surname of the adopter

283
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,475
and revert it back.

284
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,240
For doing this,

285
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,640
a commoner would surely get looked down.

286
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,200
What more if it's the Emperor?

287
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,400
His Majesty isn't on the right reasoning here.

288
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,640
How could he win it?

289
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,160
It will depend on

290
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,480
the succeeding steps then.

291
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,280
Actually,

292
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,840
it's not all bad

293
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,640
for you to be beaten.

294
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,400
I've already been beaten like this

295
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:42,975
and there's still

296
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:43,640
something good then?

297
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,520
Don't get agitated.

298
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,080
Listen to me first.

299
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,600
When my father got promoted

300
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,960
and transferred from Yangzhou to the capital,

301
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,360
he also felt that

302
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,640
it was just an empty position

303
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,480
and was unhappy about it.

304
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,360
But my grandmother said that

305
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,925
the discussion about the crown prince then

306
00:15:58,925 --> 00:15:59,800
was such a hot topic.

307
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,480
Since he just arrived,

308
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,200
rather than inviting attention,

309
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,800
it's better to burrow his head

310
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,200
and observe the situation.

311
00:16:09,925 --> 00:16:10,715
Maybe,

312
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,280
His Majesty has the same idea now.

313
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,625
Big Madam,

314
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:19,880
you are really considerable.

315
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,040
You can be a trusted aide.

316
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,720
Now,

317
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,600
it feels like we're sitting

318
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,200
among thorns under cloudy skies.

319
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,240
Are you afraid?

320
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,600
My family has so many problems like this.

321
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,480
Thinking about it now, I feel that

322
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,720
I should have considered it for you.

323
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,160
I shouldn't have went through such a big circle

324
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,560
just to marry you.

325
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,080
Maybe,

326
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,560
if you're in the He Family,

327
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,125
you could just

328
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,840
live a comfortable life that you like.

329
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,920
You'll be happier than what you are right now.

330
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,791
I'm very happy that

331
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:20,920
you came to visit me.

332
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,000
I know that I've done wrong too.

333
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,520
I just don't understand...

334
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,920
How could you be wrong?

335
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,520
You can't understand about what I'm thinking about?

336
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,080
Then...

337
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,840
Just tell me.

338
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,480
What is your

339
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,720
ideal of Big Madam?

340
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,960
I'm willing

341
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,160
to be just like her.

342
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:58,625
You didn't even get jealous

343
00:17:58,625 --> 00:17:59,603
in getting a concubine!

344
00:17:59,603 --> 00:18:01,283
You won't be able to pretend that.

345
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:06,960
But...

346
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,000
you don't really

347
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,480
care about Fengxian.

348
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,160
She clearly is just a spy that paternal auntie

349
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,520
and mother-in-law placed here.

350
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,200
Why should I be jealous of her?

351
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,840
If I care for her,

352
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,640
you would get jealous?

353
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,360
In a huge house,

354
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,440
for what annoys a master the most,

355
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,950
isn't it a harem that's unbearably chaotic

356
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,440
due to competition for his favor?

357
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,840
You...

358
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,520
You...

359
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,000
don't randomly move.

360
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,120
It will open up your wound and be very painful.

361
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,675
If I'm in pain, you're also in pain,

362
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:54,750
then that's right.

363
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,870
I'm in pain.

364
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,520
You're not yet ruthlessly in pain.

365
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,480
Prime Minister,

366
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,320
you've already tricked me

367
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,360
to give you the jade seal.

368
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,280
What do you want to trick from me now?

369
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,800
Empress Dowager,

370
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,880
the current Emperor

371
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,875
can be said to be a ruler

372
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:17,920
who can really plan ahead.

373
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:18,812
Now,

374
00:19:18,812 --> 00:19:21,040
the government is quite loose.

375
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,320
I think that

376
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,825
we shouldn't

377
00:19:23,825 --> 00:19:24,840
keep being tangled with rites matters.

378
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,600
If it affects the foundation of the government,

379
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,550
it would be disobeying the wishes

380
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,800
of the Late Emperor.

381
00:19:31,227 --> 00:19:33,793
What you said is indeed reasonable.

382
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,480
A woman like me

383
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,960
have forgotten about that.

384
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,160
Fine.

385
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,000
Since...

386
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,840
all the Ministers have this intention,

387
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,120
I would have to trouble you

388
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,280
to write the decree on my behalf.

389
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,000
I'll just sign it

390
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,720
and put on my seal.

391
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,600
Prime Minister,

392
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:19,651
let's have drinks again next time.

393
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,760
Okay. Okay.

394
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,010
Empress Dowager,

395
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,080
have a rest early.

396
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,080
Empress Dowager, please be careful.

397
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,480
Walk slowly, Empress Dowager.

398
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,440
I'm fine.

399
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,840
Your Majesty,

400
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,125
the Palace Secretariat

401
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,040
has always treated

402
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,880
the scholarly officials generously.

403
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,640
Now, there are even someone laughing at us,

404
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,150
saying that as long as

405
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:03,240
the memorial are from the Censorate,

406
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,000
the Palace Secretariat will allow it,

407
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,760
and why don't we...

408
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,560
just rename it as the Imperial Presenting Bureau then?

409
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,000
Words like that have already come out.

410
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,175
Remonstrance Official,

411
00:21:14,175 --> 00:21:16,240
are you still not backing down?

412
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,825
Prime Minister Han,

413
00:21:26,825 --> 00:21:28,440
you started this crafty discussion

414
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,440
and use improper classics as your evidence.

415
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,840
This is a tradition lasting for ages,

416
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,934
for the seniority in inheritance order,

417
00:21:32,934 --> 00:21:33,960
the legality of an adopted descendant,

418
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,080
and the honor of being the heir.

419
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,120
Even if the Palace Secretariats is criticized

420
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,560
of denouncing the ideas of others,

421
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,760
we censors and remonstrance officials

422
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,760
are willing to fight until the end.

423
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,040
Your Majesty has sage-like morals,

424
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,360
and has no inappropriate acts.

425
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,720
Both branches of the government have also

426
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,240
finished all own their duties.

427
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,477
Now,

428
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,600
only this matter about Prince Shu

429
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,520
has not been decided upon.

430
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,800
Your office repeatedly grasped on this issue

431
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,840
and severely criticized it for many times,

432
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,320
as if asking to anger His Majesty

433
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,575
and obtain the good reputation

434
00:21:57,575 --> 00:21:59,080
of offending him through your advise.

435
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,960
This... is your real motive.

436
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,250
Criticizing is the innate duty

437
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,160
of an imperial censor.

438
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,900
Who really is the one denouncing

439
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,840
the thoughts of people in the court,

440
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,480
one can see it in one glance.

441
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,440
I have the written decree of the Empress Dowager.

442
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,760
May Your Majesty read it.

443
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,280
Empress Dowager not only praised my move

444
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,560
to acknowledge my birth father,

445
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,880
but also was willing to posthumously confer

446
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,160
my birth parents as emperor and empress.

447
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,920
I'm so grateful.

448
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,120
The seal of Empress Dowager is on that decree.

449
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,480
All the subjects can read it if you want.

450
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,160
"I am allowing that

451
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,760
His Majesty honor his birth parents.

452
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,325
"Prince Shu Ande will be posthumously

453
00:23:33,325 --> 00:23:34,040
conferred as an emperor,

454
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,275
Lady Liu, Lady Li, and Lady Zhou will all

455
00:23:37,275 --> 00:23:39,520
be posthumously acknowledged as empresses.

456
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,200
I'm especially writing this decree."

457
00:23:44,569 --> 00:23:47,280
Impossible!

458
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,500
Empress Dowager was still closely

459
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,280
questioning this matter before.

460
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,985
It's just right for her to punish a supporter

461
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,920
of the Prime Minister for inciting confusion.

462
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,600
But now,

463
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,400
how come she suddenly changed her stand?

464
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,480
That is because that Empress Dowager pitied me

465
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,920
for having lost my parents early on.

466
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,840
Officials from the Censorate,

467
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,175
you shouldn't disobey the

468
00:24:06,175 --> 00:24:07,400
benevolence of Empress Dowager.

469
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,040
Your Majesty,

470
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,475
the Prime Minister is monopolizing power

471
00:24:11,475 --> 00:24:12,360
and guiding flattery.

472
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,925
He's just flattering you,

473
00:24:14,925 --> 00:24:15,880
and should be demoted!

474
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,850
In the matter about addressing

475
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,440
my deceased father as Royal Father,

476
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,250
I'll listen to the good intentions

477
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,040
of the Empress Dowager.

478
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,450
Regarding acknowledging

479
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:28,760
my deceased father as an emperor,

480
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,440
I feel embarrassed to accept it.

481
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,710
Regarding conferring my deceased mothers as empresses,

482
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,440
I really never dared to imagine such a thing.

483
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,000
Everyone, don't worry about that.

484
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,520
Meeting adjourned.

485
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,080
Your Majesty!

486
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,825
Why didn't the Empress Dowager

487
00:24:45,825 --> 00:24:47,160
listen to the court today behind curtains?

488
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,575
I ask Empress Dowager

489
00:24:48,575 --> 00:24:49,760
to listen to the court behind curtains!

490
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,920
Meeting adjourned!

491
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,960
The Royal father? Posthumous entitlement?

492
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,640
They are all just excuses.

493
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,280
Since Empress Dowager has taken a step back,

494
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,760
giving His Majesty full governing rights.

495
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,360
His Majesty will surely take a step back too.

496
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,280
Everyone now will live together peacefully.

497
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,880
His Majesty is a person with great aspirations.

498
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,600
Of course, he doesn't want to

499
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,000
be fettered by old conventions,

500
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,040
follow the rules set by his predecessor,

501
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,500
and always submit to

502
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,640
the opinion of his old mother

503
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,920
in governing his empire.

504
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,760
Empress Dowager was from the family of Generals

505
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,760
and has experienced three emperors.

506
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,600
She naturally has a hale and hearty character.

507
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,840
She lost the imperial seal last time.

508
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,200
I fear that this time, she won't easily back down.

509
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,320
You...

510
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,000
Will you be involved?

511
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,840
Are you worrying about me?

512
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,200
Of course I'm worrying about you!

513
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,800
I even didn't sleep well last night.

514
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:21,920
You...

515
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,120
Come back to the main room to sleep tonight.

516
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,800
Are you worried about

517
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,920
your Marquis,

518
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,760
or worried about Gu Tingye?

519
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,120
You always ask me those words.

520
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,520
But I...

521
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,160
I never understood

522
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,680
what you're exactly saying.

523
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,320
You are a woman

524
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,160
with a heart of iron and stone!

525
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,240
Yes, I have a heart of iron and stone.

526
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,760
It's all my fault.

527
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,560
Come back to the main room tonight to rest.

528
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,400
I'm not going.

529
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,280
It's so cold to sleep by your side.

530
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,640
Don't go then.

531
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,240
I get to have some peace and quiet.

532
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,840
State Uncle and Prime Minister Han

533
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,350
will come tonight to discuss

534
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,640
some state matters with me.

535
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,520
They will be disguising as servants

536
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,225
and it will be so inconvenient

537
00:27:21,225 --> 00:27:21,840
for them to go to our room.

538
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,920
I'll deliver some fruits and tea for you then.

539
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,120
Just go if you want to.

540
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,320
I...just want to go.

541
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,360
But I'm not doing it for you.

542
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,480
I'm afraid that when they come,

543
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,920
they'll find the dishes

544
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,120
made by our chef not delicious.

545
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,480
Did my second son

546
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,520
return to the main room to sleep already?

547
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,560
No.

548
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,000
Last night,

549
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,440
that Sheng lady had to sleep alone again.

550
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,350
The couple are

551
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:58,960
at odds with each other?

552
00:27:59,375 --> 00:27:59,960
Yes.

553
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,520
Good.

554
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,800
It's just as good as the weather today.

555
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,000
There's no movement

556
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,880
at all from that manor.

557
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,120
Second...

558
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,360
has been resting at home for some days already.

559
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,040
None of those

560
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,720
from Yuzhou ever visited him.

561
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,840
No comforting decree, too.

562
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,000
I think that His Majesty

563
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,480
has started to find him useless

564
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,600
and just a cause of delay.

565
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,200
But how...

566
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,280
how come His Majesty...

567
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,760
Didn't Second

568
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,640
also said it during the morning court

569
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,920
that nothing is better than one's birth mother.

570
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,000
As for a supercilious person that can't be tamed,

571
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,160
what do you think will a stepmother

572
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,880
like Empress Dowager think?

573
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,880
Has our son come home yet?

574
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,400
He just left two incense time ago.

575
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,960
He probably has just arrived in the palace now.

576
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,640
Go.

577
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,680
Monitor all the major gates and side gates.

578
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,800
When Young Master returns,

579
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,840
no matter what thing he has to do,

580
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,240
tell him to see us immediately.

581
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,313
Yes.

582
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,120
Hurry up.

583
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,120
Why are you so panicky?

584
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,480
How could I not?

585
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,880
He had so many people come to our house.

586
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,880
If His Majesty knows about this,

587
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,240
what will he think then?

588
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,480
Even if they don't accuse him of forming parties,

589
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,700
they would also say that he's disobeying

590
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,280
the desire of the Emperor.

591
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,160
Yuanruo works for the Remonstrance Bureau.

592
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,680
The Remonstrance Bureau

593
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,720
always disobey the Emperor's will, right?

594
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,400
It's their duty to correct the Emperor.

595
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,200
Correct the Emperor?

596
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,680
The current situation is so obvious.

597
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,200
His Majesty is bent on acknowledging

598
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,960
Prince Shu as his rightful father.

599
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,960
Empress Dowager also made a written decree

600
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,725
to posthumously honor Prince Shu and his wives

601
00:30:11,725 --> 00:30:12,640
as emperor and empress.

602
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,600
His Majesty also took a step back,

603
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,725
only acknowledging

604
00:30:16,725 --> 00:30:16,995
the Royal Father,

605
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,120
and not the empresses.

606
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,320
The two of them have reached an agreement

607
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,300
with the mother being benevolent

608
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:21,840
and the son filial.

609
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,200
Why must our son

610
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,080
still get involved in this muddled water?

611
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,160
How could Empress Dowager

612
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,800
really be at one with the Emperor?

613
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,160
Whether it's true or not,

614
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,200
the seal on

615
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,720
that decree is hers.

616
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,520
There's no more room to discuss

617
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,000
for this matter.

618
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,600
That silly son of ours,

619
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,240
and those rash people

620
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,000
from the Gu and Sheng Families,

621
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,640
just have to bite on this matter until the end.

622
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,040
Does he want to

623
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,520
ruin our whole clan?

624
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,000
The Prime Minister Han

625
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,960
insisted to have an audience with me

626
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,560
saying that he wants to

627
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,840
reconcile and be in harmony with me.

628
00:30:58,964 --> 00:31:01,425
I live deep within the inner palace.

629
00:31:01,425 --> 00:31:02,724
I'm alone and lonely,

630
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,720
It's so cold and dreary.

631
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,000
I then thought that

632
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,520
having a respite with the Emperor

633
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,600
is also good for the imperial family relationship.

634
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,600
But who knows that...

635
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,360
If I don't get to tell you

636
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,440
these grievances of mine,

637
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,400
who else can I still say it to?

638
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,280
Empress Dowager, please say them.

639
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,880
During the banquet,

640
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,360
Prime Minister Han said words

641
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,680
of how he's worried about the Emperor,

642
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:47,280
yet he kept toasting me wine.

643
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,560
He made me

644
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,080
so drunk then

645
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,300
that I eventually agreed to sign

646
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,240
that written decree.

647
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,520
How...

648
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,000
How can there be such an absurdity?

649
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,680
This.

650
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,760
The Emperor

651
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,520
was a crown prince that I and the Late Emperor

652
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,200
decided on when we were trapped

653
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,960
in a dangerous situation.

654
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,600
Before the Late Emperor died,

655
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,600
he also once held his hands

656
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,360
and instructed him on government policies.

657
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,920
He also entrusted the remainder

658
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,640
of my life to him.

659
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,680
But who knew that

660
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,360
they would deceive me?

661
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,360
Yuanruo,

662
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,720
I saw your mother

663
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,040
grow up by my side.

664
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,160
You wouldn't treat your mother

665
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,560
the same way, right?

666
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,040
I now have no place

667
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,520
to protect myself anymore.

668
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,840
You must treat your mother better then.

669
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:10,880
Excuse me.

670
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,920
May I ask for the direction

671
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,760
to the imperial kitchen?

672
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,640
Young Lord.

673
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,920
Madam said that you should immediately

674
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,920
go to see her when you return.

675
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,040
What is it about?

676
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:31,870
She didn't say.

677
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,800
She just wants you to immediately see her.

678
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,360
I am not going.

679
00:33:33,606 --> 00:33:34,160
Young Lord.

680
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,720
Our dynasty doesn't kill censors.

681
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,760
Just tell my mother that

682
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,440
she should be at ease.

683
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,720
Right.

684
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,520
Prime Minister

685
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,920
actually coerced His Majesty like that

686
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,475
and falsely claimed

687
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:20,080
to get the written decree of Empress Dowager.

688
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,760
How could this have happened?

689
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,200
I also didn't want to believe it at the start.

690
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,760
Hence, I went to the Imperial Kitchen

691
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,400
and interrogated the people there.

692
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,760
Empress Dowager had the banquet set up

693
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,760
around 7 p.m.

694
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,760
And then called for a sobering soup

695
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,160
around 9 p.m.

696
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,040
Prime Minister Han

697
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,960
then left the palace around this time.

698
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,240
All of these are recorded.

699
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,760
There is actually such a thing?

700
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,000
Such a thing...

701
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,200
This matter...

702
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,160
As the past sages said,

703
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,040
When justice is on the line,

704
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,280
a son must confront his father,

705
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,440
and a subject must confront his ruler.

706
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,320
Let's file a complaint tomorrow!

707
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,040
Right.

708
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,200
Let's file a complaint tomorrow.

709
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,280
File a complaint tomorrow.

710
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,200
Right. Right.

711
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,280
Let's go.

712
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,680
There are so many experiences

713
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,800
and so many learning

714
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,880
that even if you meticulously

715
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,360
tell them to your child,

716
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,880
no matter how filial they are

717
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,840
that they would memorize each word of it,

718
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,600
they still

719
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,000
might not truly understand it.

720
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,360
In the end, you still have

721
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,950
to let them walk out by themselves,

722
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,200
to charge out by themselves.

723
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,640
Let them slip and fall,

724
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,880
or taste the sweetness of success.

725
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,225
When they sit down

726
00:35:57,225 --> 00:35:58,440
in the middle of the night,

727
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,150
they will quietly reflect on

728
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:03,120
what they've gained and lost,

729
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,320
and recall the words that were said today.

730
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,840
Only then will they understand it.

731
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,080
Let him go.

732
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,320
Prime Minister

733
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,360
took advantage of Empress Dowager's drunk

734
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,520
fabricating the imperial decree of her

735
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,720
and stamping her jade seal on it.

736
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,720
How could members of the Palace Secretariat

737
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:29,960
dare to do

738
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,240
such an absurdity?

739
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,225
It is directly sending panic throughout

740
00:36:32,225 --> 00:36:32,960
the whole imperial court,

741
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,040
creating a stir throughout the empire.

742
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,575
This is unforgivable governing standards,

743
00:36:35,575 --> 00:36:36,600
and despised by both men and gods!

744
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,560
Young Lord dares to openly slander a high minister

745
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,160
during an imperial court meeting.

746
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,400
How should you be punished?

747
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,120
Official!

748
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,920
Do you dare to confront Empress Dowager?

749
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,175
Empress Dowager claims to be sick

750
00:36:52,175 --> 00:36:52,960
and won't attend the court.

751
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,280
She desires to return full governance to me.

752
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,720
Lord Qi, you must be cautious with your words.

753
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,875
The decree was personally stamped

754
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:01,760
by Empress Dowager.

755
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,500
Just because you claim it's falsified,

756
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,560
it's already falsified?

757
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,280
I only ask to be filial.

758
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,040
I'm contented to just

759
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,200
address my birth father as a Royal Father.

760
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,920
Although Empress Dowager is very benevolent,

761
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,600
and additionally agreed

762
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,040
to posthumously confer my birth parents

763
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,120
as an emperor and empress,

764
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,500
I'm not a person

765
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,440
that covets Sichuan after capturing Gansu.

766
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,080
The Late Emperor is still the Emperor.

767
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,400
Censors and remonstrance officials

768
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,440
can be at ease about that.

769
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:35,075
Your Majesty, since you're addressing

770
00:37:35,075 --> 00:37:36,330
your birth father as Royal Father,

771
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,025
you then have to build him an imperial tomb

772
00:37:38,025 --> 00:37:38,960
and an ancestral shrine,

773
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,450
so that he can be given offerings

774
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:43,200
by his future descendants forever.

775
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,480
That's what a Royal Father deserved to have.

776
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,240
Since a royal tomb would be built,

777
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,640
who does His Majesty want to be in charge of this?

778
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,225
it naturally would be the son of Prince Shu,

779
00:37:53,225 --> 00:37:54,360
Zhao Zonglan,

780
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,600
who would be conferred as Duke of Shu,

781
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,720
to manage this matter.

782
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,300
As for

783
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:58,840
the name of Prince Shu,

784
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,680
It's a topic that should be avoided by people.

785
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,120
Official Ding, what do you mean?

786
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,450
The matter of addressing

787
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,200
one respectfully as Royal Father

788
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,550
is within the jurisdiction of

789
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,600
the palace law of rites.

790
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,375
With official interrogating

791
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:13,640
His Majesty publicly like this,

792
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,000
are you abusing the law of rites?

793
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,375
State Uncle Shen,

794
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,425
you know that it's wrong yet you're

795
00:38:18,425 --> 00:38:19,120
not advising His Majesty otherwise.

796
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,480
You're just making him not virtuous.

797
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,800
You are the model of

798
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,600
being an unfilial and disloyal subject.

799
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,000
Your Majesty,

800
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,029
we ask that Empress Dowager

801
00:38:28,029 --> 00:38:30,720
be invited out and personally prove our claim.

802
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,925
Censors and remonstrance officials

803
00:38:37,925 --> 00:38:39,080
are the pillars of the government.

804
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,080
You assist me in governing my empire.

805
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:43,900
Just for the matter

806
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:44,720
of acknowledging my Royal Father,

807
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,400
we've wasted so much time.

808
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,750
We should return in governing

809
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,840
the salt matters and flooding disaster.

810
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:58,150
We all request that Empress Dowager come out

811
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:02,680
and personally prove our claim!

812
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,440
Your Majesty,

813
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,320
I also feel that

814
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,000
Empress Dowager should be invited to come here,

815
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,800
so my name can be cleared.

816
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,040
Empress Dowager is sick.

817
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,960
Just because of the verbal conflict,

818
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,080
you want to get her exposed

819
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,160
in the cold and wind.

820
00:39:30,115 --> 00:39:32,675
These are really the loyal subjects of my empire.

821
00:39:37,155 --> 00:39:38,075
Invite Empress Dowager.

822
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,520
Prime Minister,

823
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:41,650
why must you insist to

824
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:42,560
have the Empress Dowager come here?

825
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,600
I'm fighting in the name of the Emperor.

826
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,500
Would I allow the Censorate and Remonstrate Bureau

827
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,270
to just attack me like that?

828
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,440
I'm not clear about

829
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,120
what's now going on in the morning court today.

830
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,400
My heart feels quite uneasy.

831
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,480
The one who's worrying the most

832
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,120
must be Princess of the second rank.

833
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:25,350
I heard that because of his rash son,

834
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,960
she has fallen ill and is now bed-ridden.

835
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,000
How are the injuries of Marquis?

836
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,280
Thanks to your wound ointment,

837
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,680
he can now sit for a while.

838
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,560
No matter how huge an act is,

839
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,280
there would be an end.

840
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,280
Just like this polo match,

841
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,640
won't the winner be determined very soon?

842
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,520
That's right.

843
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,600
This is really the good Bianjing,

844
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,240
good spirit, a good battlefield.

845
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,280
Your Majesty.

846
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,760
I'm being unfilial

847
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,440
to have disturbed you.

848
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,440
What is it about?

849
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,720
Must I get to the morning court?

850
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,720
Quickly just say it.

851
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,200
My head is hurting a lot.

852
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,360
Empress Dowager,

853
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,240
Official Qi accused me

854
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,880
of fabricating your written decree.

855
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,640
This is really the greatest joke in this world.

856
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,280
May Empress Dowager clear my name

857
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,920
right in front of Official Qi.

858
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,120
For this...is it necessary to talk about this?

859
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,240
Did you personally read the decree

860
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,040
and stamped your imperial seal on it?

861
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,560
Is it necessary to say about this matter?

862
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,080
Let's stop talking about it.

863
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,200
Empress Dowager,

864
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,400
when I went to seek your audience a few days ago,

865
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,720
you heard my suggestion

866
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,880
and stamped your seal on it.

867
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,960
That's what really happened. Isn't it?

868
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,560
I've already stamped my jade seal.

869
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,640
Prime Minister,

870
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,680
what else do you want me to say?

871
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:36,960
Oh, no!

872
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,200
We've fallen into her trap.
