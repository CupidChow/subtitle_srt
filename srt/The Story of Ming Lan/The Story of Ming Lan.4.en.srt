00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,159
Episode 4

3
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,559
When you're recovered,

4
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:07,879
I will come to bring you back.

5
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,480
Your aunt's family lives poorly

6
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,120
but we can afford to feed you.

7
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:20,319
With your mother's care,

8
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,839
we were able to get some farmlands.

9
00:01:21,839 --> 00:01:23,639
and a pond.

10
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,720
It's better than this dark and dim courtyard.

11
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,400
At least there's food to eat

12
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,519
and air to breathe.

13
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,879
Your main mother and your concubine mother,

14
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:34,800
your siblings,

15
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,199
they are all so tough.

16
00:01:38,919 --> 00:01:41,760
You are just a tender little girl.

17
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,760
How can you live here?

18
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,319
Aunt,

19
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,839
don't mention this again.

20
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:54,319
Alright, I won't mention it.

21
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,120
You have taken your medicine.

22
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,599
Here.

23
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,160
Keep a Liuqiu candy in your mouth.

24
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:18,639
I want to see your Madam.

25
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,600
Thanks to Madam's fond care

26
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:29,039
to arrange such a great funeral

27
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,839
for my elder sister.

28
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,679
In my heart,

29
00:02:33,679 --> 00:02:35,199
I am so grateful.

30
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,080
But

31
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,479
I have a foolish thought

32
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,600
that I'm here to beg your approval for.

33
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,520
Don't mention it.

34
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,839
It's just vain courtesies.

35
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,880
I cherished her.

36
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,199
I only hope her path

37
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,759
in the afterlife is smoother.

38
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:00,279
It's not for my elder sister.

39
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:01,559
It's for Ming'er,

40
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,360
Sixth Miss

41
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,520
She was traumatized and she's been sick for days.

42
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:11,919
Every day she's half-dazed.

43
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:14,679
I wanna

44
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:16,440
bring her to the countryside for her recovery.

45
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,520
Ms Wei, if you love her,

46
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,399
just stay with us a few extra days.

47
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,720
With your company,

48
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,600
she might get better.

49
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,679
Indeed. Indeed.

50
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,440
My pitiful elder sister.

51
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,479
She died so young,

52
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:42,119
with just one offspring left behind.

53
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,160
If we can't preserve her either,

54
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:47,759
how can I meet my sister

55
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:49,839
in the afterlife in the future?

56
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,960
My pitiful sister.

57
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:56,240
Sister Wei, don't be sorrowful.

58
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:02,960
Go and send for the Master.

59
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,360
Go.

60
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:09,119
Ms Wei,

61
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:10,520
if there's any trouble,

62
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,199
you ought to say it so we can discuss it together.

63
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:14,039
It's just a matter of some money,

64
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,759
so don't exhaust Sixth Miss.

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,720
OK.

66
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,320
This nanny's mouth…

67
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,399
how prickly.

68
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,119
She spoke

69
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,839
as though I came to ask for money!

70
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:32,119
That girl's surname is Sheng after all.

71
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,880
We'll take her back to raise her for a few days,

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,040
and what can we seek?

73
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:38,160
Why are you trying to stop my speaking

74
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,239
with money?

75
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,519
You're just belittling me.

76
00:04:41,799 --> 00:04:43,559
My sister in the heaven

77
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:44,559
will be so sad.

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,799
Have some tea.

79
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,640
Ms Wei is here.

80
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,559
Greetings to the Magistrate.

81
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,799
Have a seat.

82
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:15,119
Ms Wei cherishes Ming'er.

83
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:16,079
We all know this.

84
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:20,160
But to take her back home

85
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,920
won't be appropriate.

86
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:27,399
The Magistrate, you can make your sage judgment.

87
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:30,040
Our family was originally a literate one too.

88
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,640
My Sister

89
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,920
studied from my father since she was young.

90
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,799
She was well-educated and breeding.

91
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,119
She's not from a dinged-up family.

92
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,239
If it hadn't been my father dying so young

93
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,959
with seven or eight family members waiting to be fed…

94
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:42,959
my sister was so ill-fated!

95
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,559
Your family is so well-mannered.

96
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:47,160
How can you not know

97
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,480
the rules?

98
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,200
And my family is living affluently.

99
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:54,359
Every child has food to eat.

100
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,959
If our family can't afford to feed her,

101
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,320
It won't be too late that we come and beg you.

102
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,279
My sister suddenly passed away.

103
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,239
I heard it was because

104
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:12,600
the baby was too big to be delivered.

105
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,399
The baby died

106
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:20,359
and we also felt…

107
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,679
Then it means…

108
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,239
that my sister,

109
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,640
you can say she died

110
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,720
for the Sheng family.

111
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,000
You cannot say like that, though.

112
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:31,839
Since the old days, when a woman gives birth,

113
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:33,440
she steps a foot into the gate of hell.

114
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,440
Who knows what the result can be?

115
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:38,600
How coincidental.

116
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:40,279
I also heard at the time

117
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:42,200
that Madam and the Magistrate

118
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:44,320
were not home.

119
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:47,119
Only a Mistress was managing things,

120
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,200
and having my Ming'er, an eight-year-old girl,

121
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,000
run to the streets to send for a physician.

122
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:55,239
Ms Wei,

123
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:57,040
where did you hear such a thing?

124
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:02,480
I am a foolish person.

125
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,679
I thought

126
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,079
the Magistrate is going to get promoted

127
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:06,880
and he needs to go to the capital.

128
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,040
And Madam

129
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,079
must have so much to look after.

130
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,640
If I take her with me,

131
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,160
I will ease

132
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,079
your burden a bit.

133
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,720
Then that nanny there,

134
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,640
she suspected that I was trying to get some money!

135
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:24,799
Which nanny?

136
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Just an illiterate fool,

137
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,920
speaking such nonsense out of nowhere.

138
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,880
Yes, yes.

139
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,799
Ms Wei,

140
00:07:38,799 --> 00:07:41,600
you must not care to nitpick with that fool.

141
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,839
We will hire the best physician

142
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,359
for Ming'er,

143
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:46,200
to board here.

144
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:47,799
And take her pulse day and night,

145
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:49,359
with seven or eight maidservants taking care of her.

146
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,959
I will look after her personally

147
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,720
and you can be at complete ease.

148
00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:59,399
As long as Ming'er is well taken care of,

149
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,000
even if I die,

150
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:05,959
I am content.

151
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,119
That Ms Wei,

152
00:08:11,119 --> 00:08:12,239
how come she's not mentioning

153
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:13,519
the matter about Sixth Miss anymore?

154
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,399
Who knows?

155
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,640
I guess it's because the medicine costs are high.

156
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:23,359
Old Madam is back.

157
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,799
Were you well when living in the mountain, Mother?

158
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,159
Was your dinner tonight delicious to you, Mother?

159
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:22,719
Master,

160
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:24,200
I brought you a bowl of pear soup too.

161
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,520
Thank you, Nanny Fang.

162
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:43,280
Mother.

163
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,080
It's all your son's fault.

164
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,000
Just scold me.

165
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,840
I don't dare to scold you.

166
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:55,080
Who knows if you're cursing me

167
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,080
in your heart.

168
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,359
I don't know

169
00:09:57,359 --> 00:09:59,000
where you got the news

170
00:09:59,239 --> 00:10:01,239
to have you rush back

171
00:10:01,239 --> 00:10:02,880
to face this mess.

172
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:05,440
I don't dare. I am guilty about it.

173
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,719
Do you remember

174
00:10:08,719 --> 00:10:10,760
what I told you about

175
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,840
how did your elder brother die so young?

176
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:15,320
I remember.

177
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,359
My only son,

178
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,080
just dying

179
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,960
in that whore's hands!

180
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:22,719
Mother.

181
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:24,799
Now your son,

182
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,799
Your son!

183
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,239
By the same way,

184
00:10:29,239 --> 00:10:31,159
he was murdered too!

185
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,520
Mother,

186
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,599
It's all my fault.

187
00:10:36,599 --> 00:10:37,919
Your son is useless.

188
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,640
You're very useful.

189
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:43,000
You're too useful!

190
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,479
If you were useless, you would go along with custom,

191
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,760
And let the legal wife be the priority

192
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,919
And let her rule things!

193
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:52,840
You wouldn't pamper your concubine to slight your wife

194
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,479
And caused the house to be in such a mess!

195
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:57,960
I know.

196
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,359
Your real mother, Mistress Chun,

197
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:00,520
It wasn't easy for her to raise you.

198
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:03,559
Though I was the legal wife,

199
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,039
I had a hard time preserving myself back then

200
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,520
And I failed to protect you two.

201
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:09,760
Hence, you are so fearful that Lin Qinshuang

202
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,960
and the children

203
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,640
will experience the pain you suffered then.

204
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:17,080
So you gave her fields and stores.

205
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,559
And even got a concubine.

206
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,200
Living a more decent life than Your Madam!

207
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,080
Mother is compassionate towards me.

208
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,960
You are near my thoughts.

209
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:28,320
Mother.

210
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,440
Your Madam has an explosive temper.

211
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,919
I am scared of her. That's why…

212
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,320
Rise.

213
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,320
Drink some pear soup.

214
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:04,640
There's an order to all things.

215
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:06,400
You're worried about your main wife's temper,

216
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,799
but you should find a way to handle it.

217
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,640
Coax her, or persuade her, or intimidate her.

218
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:14,960
You should always do it by rules.

219
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:18,039
But how did you handle this?

220
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,159
Everyone in the house

221
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:20,239
Is supposed to have her own duty.

222
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:22,239
Since you pampered the concubine

223
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,640
And slighted your main wife,

224
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:24,760
Then the main and concubine

225
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,080
Were out of order!

226
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,559
Those wicked servants!

227
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:31,320
They saw that Qinshuang was inexperienced,

228
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,640
And she didn't know how to manage the house affairs,

229
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:36,320
So they gathered together all the days for entertainment.

230
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,719
I beat them harshly and sold them off!

231
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:44,599
What I mean by this

232
00:12:44,719 --> 00:12:46,280
it's fine if you really don't understand it,

233
00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:46,799
or it's fine

234
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,719
if you don't want to answer it.

235
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,640
I don't care anymore.

236
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,960
But two lives!

237
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,320
There are some words

238
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,559
that I have to say even if I offend you.

239
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,080
Whatever you say, Mother,

240
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,599
Your son will obey.

241
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:09,239
This is all your Mistress Lin's duty.

242
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,919
She managed it like that

243
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:12,599
And it shows she's not capable!

244
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:17,159
In this household,

245
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:18,960
it's you, Mother,

246
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:21,599
Who can really manage it well.

247
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,520
Don't try to persuade me with that either.

248
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:26,719
At this age,

249
00:13:26,719 --> 00:13:28,359
and just recovered from an illness too,

250
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,760
how do I have the energy to manage the house?

251
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:33,239
Just let me live for a few more years.

252
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,640
Your main wife

253
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,200
Held a grand funeral for Mistress Wei

254
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,039
with so much respect and dignity,

255
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:42,479
And extinguished the Wei family's anger.

256
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:45,159
Your main wife did well!

257
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,679
If Mother says that she did well,

258
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:49,599
Then surely she did.

259
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I know…

260
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:55,080
That she talks with prickly words

261
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,119
and you find them unsavory.

262
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,239
But you think about it carefully.

263
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,119
She's the youngest of the main wife from the Wang's,

264
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:04,039
Growing up with much love and care.

265
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,719
But due to your mismanaging of the house

266
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,520
Pampering the concubine to slight the main wife,

267
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,760
All of Yangzhou officials and their

268
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,359
have been laughing at her for years.

269
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,280
She has endured it until today

270
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,640
And surely she's full of anger.

271
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,440
Go tell her

272
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:18,080
that Sixth Miss

273
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,359
Won't concern her,

274
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:23,080
Just let me take care of her.

275
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,119
Go ahead.

276
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:28,280
I should be resting.

277
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,479
Minglan is fine in Hualan's place.

278
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,559
And she's sick.

279
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:36,119
We don't want her to pass her illness to you.

280
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,440
Mother, if you like raising children

281
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,119
Then raise Molan.

282
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:44,039
I hear that She's very filial.

283
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:46,200
Your Lin Qinshaung

284
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,840
Took care of Mistress Wei and got her dead,

285
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:50,200
And should I disregard the orphaned daughter while

286
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,119
Bring that Lin Qinshuang's daughter

287
00:14:52,119 --> 00:14:53,719
To me to raise instead?

288
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,200
How great is that!

289
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,760
Is there another place on earth that you get rewarded

290
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,080
And promoted when you let the dam collapse in your county?

291
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,280
Your son.

292
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,440
I was just thinking Molan is gentle and clever.

293
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:08,719
You wouldn't be too tired from it.

294
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,440
Do you think that person from the Wei Family really came for

295
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:14,919
Six Miss to go back and

296
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:15,960
Raise her?

297
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,479
She just was

298
00:15:18,479 --> 00:15:19,440
Beating about the bush!

299
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,239
If the Six Miss is well taken care of,

300
00:15:22,239 --> 00:15:23,559
Then all is well,

301
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,039
Or else…

302
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:27,719
We must be careful.

303
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,760
That…

304
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,039
Hualan is keeping Minglan

305
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:36,400
And living in the main wife's courtyard.

306
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,679
How can that be not good care?

307
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:41,039
You, you!

308
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:43,159
These wicked servants.

309
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,719
They lived in the manor for years

310
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:45,840
And know everything.

311
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:48,840
They could be taken to Bianjing with us

312
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,960
And then disposed where no one knows the story.

313
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,880
But you just had to choose now

314
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,080
to beat and sell them to pile up grudges.

315
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,760
With your concubine dead first,

316
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,559
and you sold off servants,

317
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:02,000
who wouldn't guess out the strangeness?

318
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:04,000
What if someone is jealous of your promotion,

319
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:05,239
And drags them to testify against you

320
00:16:05,239 --> 00:16:06,679
in a petition?

321
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,320
You still think you can get promoted smoothly

322
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,080
and go to Bianjing?

323
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,919
What a mess.

324
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:17,119
I was too reckless indeed.

325
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,119
What Mother said is correct.

326
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:24,520
I was shallow.

327
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:25,880
May you teach me more.

328
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,880
"How thou loveth thy child should be

329
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,119
How thou should honor how others loveth theirs."

330
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:33,479
This book,

331
00:16:33,479 --> 00:16:35,919
Magistrate, you might as well read it carefully again.

332
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,400
Ok.

333
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:49,679
Peruse it.

334
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,119
The burial will be held tommorrow.

335
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I heard

336
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,640
You bought a very good coffin for her.

337
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,760
Sister Wei had a tough life.

338
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:13,479
She only had a few

339
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:15,439
leisure years in our home.

340
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,160
She's gone now,

341
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,920
So I want her to go with comfort.

342
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,560
So when she reaches the other world,

343
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,479
she may enjoy some ease.

344
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,520
Besides…

345
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:33,319
If it weren't for me

346
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,400
Going to my parents house to bid farewell,

347
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:38,959
If it hadn't been both of us that left,

348
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,800
Then the servants would've been better managed

349
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:45,040
And this wretched scene wouldn't have played out.

350
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:48,760
Sister Wei is too pitiful.

351
00:17:53,199 --> 00:17:54,280
I have nothing to say then.

352
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,079
If we dig deeper,

353
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:58,599
It's my fault because I got promoted.

354
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,880
If it's not for us moving to Bianjing,

355
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,160
Then we wouldn't have gone to your family home

356
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,920
In Runzhou to bid farewell.

357
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,880
It's due to her lack of luck.

358
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,479
Come here.

359
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:19,160
I will be honest.

360
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,439
Your temper is not good.

361
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,839
Look how narrow-minded you are.

362
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,920
Your temper is indeed not good!

363
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:34,920
However,

364
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,280
You are the most kind-hearted.

365
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:39,560
Look at how you arranged

366
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,359
Mistress Wei's funeral.

367
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:43,319
It's shown by that.

368
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:46,199
You are so innately kind.

369
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:52,079
How scalding!

370
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,199
I think you have

371
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,040
Already worked hard these days,

372
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,920
But

373
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,640
You manage the house from now on.

374
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,640
Why do you mention this suddenly?

375
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:16,680
Qinshuang's got such a gentle temperament.

376
00:19:16,719 --> 00:19:18,680
She can't be firm enough.

377
00:19:18,719 --> 00:19:20,800
Those servants aren't scared of her

378
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:23,199
And she can't manage them well.

379
00:19:23,239 --> 00:19:26,000
Normally, if things go well, you don't think of me.

380
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,160
But when things are tiring, you come to me.

381
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,680
You are my proper wife

382
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,800
That I begged to wed with betrothals and matchmaking.

383
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,599
Other than you,

384
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,479
Who can I depend on with ease?

385
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,680
Right?

386
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,800
Mother. Mother.

387
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,079
I heard from the Madam

388
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,760
that Master

389
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,479
Hasn't gone to Mistress Lin's all these days.

390
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:18,400
Mistress Lin cried asking to see the Master,

391
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,319
But she didn't get to.

392
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,719
This time,

393
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:22,800
I think there's hope.

394
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:25,640
Don't say that, not even close.

395
00:20:26,479 --> 00:20:28,160
Even pouring some cold water into a hot stove,

396
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,640
It's not something

397
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,040
That can be cooled so easily.

398
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:32,920
Mother.

399
00:20:34,479 --> 00:20:35,760
Pitiful child.

400
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,520
She didn't even get to see her for a last look.

401
00:20:44,199 --> 00:20:45,560
The path is still has a long way to go.

402
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:50,239
We just trot on it slowly.

403
00:20:56,239 --> 00:20:58,479
May you announce to Master and Madam

404
00:20:58,479 --> 00:21:00,319
That I'm delivering cherry cakes.

405
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:04,439
Miss, a big gratitude.

406
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,359
Hey, you!

407
00:21:06,479 --> 00:21:07,800
I eat the Madam's food

408
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,520
And watch the Madam's doors.

409
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,160
I already said

410
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,680
Master and Madam have retired,

411
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,760
And it means they have retired!

412
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,479
I learned this from Mother Liu. Did I do well?

413
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,680
Mother.

414
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,760
Mistress!

415
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,599
Mother.

416
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,280
Mother.

417
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,119
Mistress Lin!

418
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,760
Please quiet down.

419
00:21:58,479 --> 00:21:59,839
Madam is looking to

420
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:00,839
Pick up all our faults.

421
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,640
What faults have we had!

422
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,239
Father.

423
00:22:05,239 --> 00:22:07,079
Father doesn't want us anymore?

424
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,079
Shut up!

425
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,119
Mo'er.

426
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:20,319
Your father won't abandon us.

427
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:21,000
Your father

428
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,040
Must cherish us,

429
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,800
Or else…

430
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,560
Or who else can I depend upon?

431
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,359
Mother.

432
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:31,319
Mother.

433
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,359
Mother.

434
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,439
Your study is of utmost importance.

435
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:57,119
Take care, Young Master.

436
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:58,520
Don't worry, Nanny.

437
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,880
I will come to visit you in Yangzhou in a few years.

438
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,640
You raised me since I was little.

439
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,040
In a few more years, when I grow up a bit more,

440
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:05,880
I will bring you with me to Dongjing.

441
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,239
Young Master.

442
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,000
Mistress Wei told me to thank you on that day

443
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,760
And I forgot.

444
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:15,800
This, this is for you.

445
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,079
Your great kindness and grace,

446
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:18,599
I shall never forget them.

447
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,359
Don't do that. Don't.

448
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:25,319
It's just my duty.

449
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,199
Thank you.

450
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,719
Ming'er is good.

451
00:24:29,239 --> 00:24:31,880
Ming'er is her grandmother's good granddaughter.

452
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,160
Remember this.

453
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:41,160
As long as I, your grandmother, am by your side,

454
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,439
You should fear nothing.

455
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,520
My granddaughter Ming'er

456
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,880
has someone who loves her!

457
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,199
Cry it out.

458
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,239
You'll feel better

459
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:09,640
once you cry it out.

460
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,400
“Presiding at court and asking for the methods,

461
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,000
the Emperor's prowess is accomplished with ease

462
00:25:32,439 --> 00:25:34,640
and people's cares are eased.”

463
00:25:40,719 --> 00:25:41,319
Listen.

464
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:44,520
Do you hear the lyre music?

465
00:25:45,439 --> 00:25:46,079
I heard it.

466
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,599
Mistress Lin is playing the lyre.

467
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:55,439
The phoenix courts the male.

468
00:25:55,439 --> 00:25:56,800
She never got tired of that.

469
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,520
She can play it a thousand times

470
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,959
and the Master won't go to her room.

471
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,760
My skills are a million miles away

472
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,319
from Sixth Sister's.

473
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,680
I've heard

474
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,640
Sixth Miss often just sit in Old Madam's room.

475
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,880
Sometimes all day long.

476
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,560
She doesn't cry, whine or talk.

477
00:26:23,479 --> 00:26:24,359
By the way,

478
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:26,560
She hasn't played pot-pitching for a long time.

479
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,599
Sixth Sister won't say a word,

480
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:30,839
Even when Molan poked her, she was motionless.

481
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,520
She went back to her room and hid there.

482
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,719
She's going to turn into an idiot soon.

483
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:35,560
Stop talking nonsense.

484
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:38,439
Learn your Thousand Character Classic.

485
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,560
We are on a boat now.

486
00:26:41,959 --> 00:26:43,000
So you won't be able to avoid your father

487
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,760
Who will check your homework.

488
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,760
If I go and play at Grandmother's place,

489
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,199
Father won't dare to go there.

490
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:56,560
The Master

491
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,680
has been at my place for almost half a month.

492
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:03,359
That bitch came a few times

493
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:05,719
And she was blocked by you.

494
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,400
I didn't hear

495
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,560
the Master said anything,

496
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,959
so I think he's tired of her.

497
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:12,680
Once we are in Dongjing, I will find an opportunity

498
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,319
to sell her to a far-away place.

499
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:15,439
If we don't see her again,

500
00:27:15,439 --> 00:27:17,680
wouldn't it be more comfortable?

501
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,760
I fear it won't be

502
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,119
as good as you think.

503
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:25,040
Why?

504
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,800
The elder Sister frequently goes to Old Madam's room

505
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,760
to see Sixth Miss and

506
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:31,119
would often see Molan there as well.

507
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,520
Changfeng likes to go see Young Master Changbai,

508
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:37,319
I've never seen them so eager before.

509
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:41,400
They must be seeking information about Master.

510
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,520
Is there still the sound of the lyre?

511
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,680
Don't think so.

512
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:56,560
Bring some puff pastries and cherry cakes

513
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,959
to go see His Lordship.

514
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,640
Yes.

515
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,880
My husband,

516
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,560
please let me see you.

517
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,359
My husband.

518
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,079
Master. You're an official.

519
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,520
Even on the court

520
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,239
You should let them explain it!

521
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,319
I heard you were sick.

522
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,560
I can see that you have good vitality.

523
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,640
It's late in the night,

524
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,640
and you still have the energy

525
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,800
to create a ruckus here.

526
00:28:40,199 --> 00:28:41,160
Madam, please don't be angry.

527
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:44,479
Please show some mercy,

528
00:28:44,479 --> 00:28:45,680
and let me go in

529
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,640
to ask the Master a few questions.

530
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,079
If I can't say anything,

531
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:53,160
I will knock my head to die here!

532
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,400
You don't need to use this tactic to die here.

533
00:28:56,439 --> 00:28:58,359
I won't be tricked by you.

534
00:28:58,359 --> 00:28:59,920
If you want to die,

535
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,880
jump off the boat to make a quick death.

536
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,959
Master,

537
00:29:05,959 --> 00:29:08,040
I waited on you for many years

538
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,239
and raised two children for you!

539
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,040
If you want me to die today,

540
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,160
I will jump off immediately!

541
00:29:14,239 --> 00:29:15,439
Even if I'm dead,

542
00:29:15,439 --> 00:29:17,920
you should let me become an innocent ghost!

543
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:18,800
You servants,

544
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,839
are you still alive?

545
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:21,400
Drag her away now!

546
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,199
Why don't you

547
00:29:22,199 --> 00:29:23,280
allow me to talk?

548
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:24,640
Are you afraid that

549
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,800
I will reveal anything?

550
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,359
What dirty water are you throwing at me?

551
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,719
Quit trying to cause a ruckus here!

552
00:29:30,719 --> 00:29:31,839
What am I scared of?

553
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:33,400
Aren't you going to drag her away?

554
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:37,520
Master. Master.

555
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,760
I have suffered a lot.

556
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:58,280
I can't be falsely accused by others

557
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,560
without any cause or reason.

558
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:03,119
Even if I die,

559
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:04,719
I must become an innocent ghost.

560
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:10,680
I planned to leave some dignity for you.

561
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,880
If you insist on speaking,

562
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,839
make it clear then.

563
00:30:14,719 --> 00:30:16,079
Do you mean that

564
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:18,800
Mistress Wei killed herself?

565
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:23,520
The people in Sister Wei's room

566
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,640
were rascals.

567
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:27,839
Master saw to it himself to dismiss them.

568
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,599
I sent my own maidservants

569
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,839
to go serve her.

570
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:35,680
Tonics and food, clothes and wares. I chose the best.

571
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,280
Everything was the best.

572
00:30:39,479 --> 00:30:41,640
Just the astragalus, jujube and angelica alone

573
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,880
were such an expense.

574
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:45,599
The cubilose

575
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:47,800
was also from my personal account.

576
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,040
Each and every single one.

577
00:30:50,199 --> 00:30:50,560
Master,

578
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,400
you could see this when you were in the house.

579
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,199
Even if I were to meet Sister Wei in the underworld,

580
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,479
I would still dare to confront her.

581
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:01,959
What a sharp tongue you have.

582
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,920
If I die by being falsely accused,

583
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:10,000
I won't be able to talk.

584
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,199
As long as

585
00:31:14,199 --> 00:31:16,479
I still have one last breath,

586
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,040
I will still want to fight for my innocence.

587
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:20,560
Two whole lives

588
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,079
died in your hands!

589
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,880
The great midwife and great maidservant

590
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,359
you got killed her!

591
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,800
Master，please be sage .

592
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,319
I already found the midwife way in advance

593
00:31:30,439 --> 00:31:32,680
and gave good instructions to her.

594
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,640
They said that she was the best.

595
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,839
I even gave her a quarter kilo of silver

596
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:37,040
to thank her

597
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,280
and asked her to come immediately

598
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,359
on the day of the delivery.

599
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,920
But when she was here,

600
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,479
Sister Wei's baby was too big

601
00:31:43,479 --> 00:31:44,959
and she couldn't give birth to it.

602
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:47,719
She lost courage and ran away.

603
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:48,880
I pushed the maid

604
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,599
to hire another midwife,

605
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,599
but there weren't any in the vicinity.

606
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:56,199
I went to the east part of the city before I could find one.

607
00:31:56,199 --> 00:31:57,959
I am someone without dignity

608
00:31:57,959 --> 00:31:59,760
and resolute measures,

609
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,599
but I never

610
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:03,199
had any ulterior motive, Master!

611
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:07,599
This is strange.

612
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:09,599
You went outside to hire someone else,

613
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,599
why then did that Sixth Miss

614
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:12,119
run out to do that too?

615
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,640
Master.

616
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,079
You and Madam had both left the house.

617
00:32:17,479 --> 00:32:19,000
Old Madam went to pay respects

618
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,599
to the Taoist master.

619
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:22,359
The servants

620
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:25,040
wanted to relax and have some fun.

621
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,079
They were gambling and drinking,

622
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:28,839
no one listened to me.

623
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:30,880
I joined the family

624
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,959
only for a few years,

625
00:32:31,959 --> 00:32:32,560
but those old women

626
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,199
have been here for many years.

627
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,199
Though it's I managed the house,

628
00:32:37,199 --> 00:32:38,920
I couldn't set rules and couldn't control them.

629
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,119
The servants refused to do anything.

630
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:45,839
Master, don't even say that I'm useless.

631
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,040
Even Sixth Sister personally

632
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,079
called for Nanny Zhao and the rest,

633
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:54,439
she wasn't be able to get anyone.

634
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,640
Master, Madam,

635
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,000
you are my benefactors.

636
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,760
Heaven and earth,

637
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,119
the spirits in heaven, all can see

638
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,880
that I'm telling the truth.

639
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:17,520
If I meant no good to Sister Wei,

640
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:19,680
then let me be clubbed to death

641
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,119
and my spirit never get reborn!

642
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,719
You should be a story-teller

643
00:33:26,719 --> 00:33:28,280
with that crafty mouth of yours.

644
00:33:29,239 --> 00:33:30,959
In the way you've put it

645
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,400
not only you had no fault

646
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,239
in the matter of Wei Mistress losing two lives,

647
00:33:33,239 --> 00:33:34,239
you actually made a feat!

648
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,760
No, I was wrong.

649
00:33:39,719 --> 00:33:42,079
I committed a big mistake.

650
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,359
I shouldn't…

651
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:48,079
I shouldn't have been such a lenient housekeeper.

652
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:49,800
At the most crucial moment,

653
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:51,520
I couldn't command the servants into action.

654
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,560
And I shouldn't have just stood and watched

655
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,359
when I couldn't dispatch these wicked servants.

656
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,000
I should have

657
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,839
personally gone to request the physician

658
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,400
and midwife.

659
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,520
I made a big mistake.

660
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:08,159
But…

661
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,639
but saying that I had the intention to harm Sister Wei,

662
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,280
I will die without closing my eyes.

663
00:34:16,439 --> 00:34:18,120
Above everything,

664
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,479
I'm also from a good family.

665
00:34:20,479 --> 00:34:23,159
A human's life is precious.

666
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,760
I know that too.

667
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,199
You shrew!

668
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,639
You are cunning and persuasive!

669
00:34:28,479 --> 00:34:30,800
Madam, you say that I'm cunning and persuasive,

670
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,800
but I've always

671
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:34,320
devoted my heart without regard to anything else!

672
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:35,840
Or else,

673
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,719
I wouldn't have just tossed the chance

674
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,239
to be the main wife with some others,

675
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,879
and come here to be Master's concubine!

676
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,120
Others laughed at me,

677
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,239
mocked

678
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,520
and belittled me,

679
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,520
It was acceptable.

680
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:53,360
I have always been infatuated with you.

681
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,719
I can't control my deep love.

682
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,800
Sister,

683
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,560
I know you don't like me.

684
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:06,959
I dare not defend myself.

685
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,560
Please,

686
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,320
just take me as a slave

687
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,919
and give me a small room to huddle in.

688
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,360
As long as

689
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,560
I can see the Master,

690
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,000
even if a thousand people curse me and spit at me,

691
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,879
I will have no regrets!

692
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,000
Sister,

693
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,040
please take pity on me.

694
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:27,120
Regard me as a toy

695
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,000
and let me serve you, Elder Sister!

696
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,159
Elder Sister, I will kowtow to you.

697
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:35,080
I'm begging you, Elder sister!

698
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,320
I will kowtow to you.

699
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,360
Shuang'er. Shuang'er!

700
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,800
Get up and we can communicate.

701
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,879
What is this?

702
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:44,719
I'm begging you. Take pity on me!

703
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,360
You can beat or scold me.

704
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,840
Don't regard me

705
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,879
as an evil woman!

706
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,000
Get up, get up!

707
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:52,840
No! Elder Sister…

708
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,199
Elder Sister, I'm begging you, Elder Sister!

709
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:00,000
In the future,

710
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,239
if there is anything I may misunderstand,

711
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:03,439
you can scold or beat me.

712
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,760
I will obey you.

713
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:07,959
I'm really

714
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:09,800
infatuated with the Master.

715
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,320
Sister, I'm begging you. Please be kind to me.

716
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:13,919
Elder Sister.

717
00:36:13,919 --> 00:36:16,080
Please allow me an inch of a place to stay.

718
00:36:16,959 --> 00:36:19,320
I'm begging you, Elder Sister.

719
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:26,040
You…

720
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,719
Shuang'er. Shuang'er! Shuang'er. What's wrong!

721
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,120
Shuang'er, someone, come in now.

722
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,399
Come in now. Shuang'er!

723
00:36:34,879 --> 00:36:36,479
Mistress!

724
00:36:36,479 --> 00:36:38,959
Call for the physician.

725
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,679
Get the physician now!

726
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,919
She…she is an evil demon.

727
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,959
She is an evil demon.

728
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,320
This evil demon.

729
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,560
It's fortunate that you met me now

730
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,879
that I can support you.

731
00:37:14,479 --> 00:37:15,959
When I was young,

732
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,919
at that time Sheng House

733
00:37:19,919 --> 00:37:21,840
was kept hostage by that whore.

734
00:37:22,959 --> 00:37:24,159
My mother and I

735
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:25,800
could only exist in a crack.

736
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,600
Before I was seven years old,

737
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,520
an inch of my skin was not intact.

738
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:34,000
Luckily,

739
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,600
Old Madam secretly protected me.

740
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,919
If not so,

741
00:37:38,919 --> 00:37:40,919
I wouldn't be alive today.

742
00:37:45,879 --> 00:37:46,879
Darling Husband…

743
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:51,479
You and your mother suffered a lot.

744
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,439
It's a pity that she passed away too soon

745
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,600
to have enjoyed any blessings.

746
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,879
Hence,

747
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:03,879
I will never let you and your child

748
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:05,239
live like

749
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:06,199
my mother and I.

750
00:38:08,959 --> 00:38:09,560
Darling husband.

751
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,120
Your body is weak.

752
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,439
Lie down now.

753
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:24,879
Don't just stand there gawking.

754
00:38:24,879 --> 00:38:26,239
Don't get lost.

755
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,399
Where is Bai'er?

756
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:33,080
Bai'er.

757
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:33,800
Hello.

758
00:38:38,919 --> 00:38:39,840
Once you have settled down,

759
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,760
come and find me.

760
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,159
I will take you on a tour of the city.

761
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,360
Come.

762
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,719
Second Brother!

763
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,840
I'm taking my leave then.

764
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,520
Alright.

765
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,560
Tingwei has grown taller and has put on weight.

766
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:16,719
Mother,

767
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:17,719
why did you personally come?

768
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,399
You…left a letter and ran to Yangzhou

769
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:22,600
without saying anything.

770
00:39:22,959 --> 00:39:24,280
Your father was angry

771
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,520
for several months.

772
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,879
Since he's angry,

773
00:39:27,879 --> 00:39:29,000
I won't go home then,

774
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,439
or a good beating

775
00:39:30,439 --> 00:39:31,159
awaits me.

776
00:39:31,399 --> 00:39:32,919
He might even bind me.

777
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:35,080
Mother,

778
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:35,919
I will be home in two days.

779
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,840
Where will you be staying then?

780
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:41,560
That child earlier,

781
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,080
has he just moved to Bianjing?

782
00:39:43,399 --> 00:39:45,000
Bianjing has so many great places,

783
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,159
so surely I can go somewhere.

784
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,800
I am taking my leave.

785
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,159
Tingye.

786
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,080
Third Brother, slow down.

787
00:39:52,959 --> 00:39:55,719
Second Brother, come back with me

788
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:57,280
and help me pick a bird's nest!

789
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,760
I will make a kite with you when I'm back.

790
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:02,080
Slow down.

791
00:40:28,399 --> 00:40:29,840
A few days ago,

792
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,760
Jiang-Zhe and Liang-Hu provinces submitted reports

793
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:36,439
that they found several spots

794
00:40:36,879 --> 00:40:40,239
where signs of a locust disaster were found.

795
00:40:40,919 --> 00:40:44,080
If there is truly a locust epidemic,

796
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,040
then there will be a thousand miles of bare earth

797
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,800
and a single grain will be not reaped.

798
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,399
Down there.

799
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:53,959
Anyone who is from the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces?

800
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,439
I ,Secretary Sheng,

801
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:15,719
and have just been appointed as Minister,

802
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:18,479
just arrived at the capital from Yangzhou yesterday.

803
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,199
I know you. You write well.

804
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,000
Speak.

805
00:41:25,439 --> 00:41:27,520
I have seen the locust plague a few times.

806
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:28,919
As long as

807
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:30,280
it's when they're still young,

808
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:32,280
if you keep around a few extra ducks and herons

809
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,320
to let them eat them up,

810
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,560
then it's not much of a threat.

811
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,360
Your Majesty,

812
00:41:37,919 --> 00:41:40,679
I have another urgent matter to report.

813
00:41:44,479 --> 00:41:47,000
Today we only discuss the locust matter.

814
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:50,040
You may not deliberately complicate this matter.

815
00:41:50,879 --> 00:41:52,199
By nature, all living things

816
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:53,639
have their branches and roots.

817
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,040
Where does they come from,

818
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,040
It's just reproduction and succession.

819
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:00,159
If it's about that,

820
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,080
you can come and report to me in the study.

821
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,479
Your Majesty.

822
00:42:06,919 --> 00:42:07,800
Yesterday,

823
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,959
I made a plea to seek Your Majesty's attendance

824
00:42:09,959 --> 00:42:10,959
at the study.

825
00:42:11,879 --> 00:42:15,159
Your Majesty and I discussed the old times.

826
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,120
On the day before yesterday,

827
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,639
Your Majesty asked me to the study to discuss a painting.

828
00:42:21,479 --> 00:42:23,679
I am just too anxious,

829
00:42:23,879 --> 00:42:25,760
and I cannot pay heed to dignity now!

830
00:42:26,399 --> 00:42:27,520
It takes ten years to grow a tree

831
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,520
and a hundred years to train a man.

832
00:42:28,919 --> 00:42:30,280
The best action is for Your Majesty

833
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,840
to bring in and adopt a child from the Imperial clan!

834
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,199
Are you pressing me?
