00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,880
The Story of Ming Lan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,580
Episode 54

3
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,400
Sister-in-law, she's young and insensible.

4
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,040
it's so embarrassing to be fighting.

5
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:07,960
I'll just take her away.

6
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,560
She's young and insensible.

7
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,280
But you all who are older than her

8
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,200
don't seem to be that much different.

9
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,920
How come you talk like that?

10
00:01:13,202 --> 00:01:14,519
Who are you calling a vixen earlier?!

11
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,480
You!

12
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:16,520
Who's the vixen?

13
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,640
Say it again!

14
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,480
Stop crying.

15
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,880
Stop crying. Let's go. Let's go.

16
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,640
The banquet in the front courtyard has been opened

17
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,960
May everyone go there now.

18
00:01:25,157 --> 00:01:26,613
Let's go, Sister-in-law.

19
00:01:28,848 --> 00:01:29,450
I'm sure that it's our fault

20
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:30,193
for not entertaining everyone well.

21
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,080
My servants weren't able to serve you properly.

22
00:01:32,781 --> 00:01:34,719
Madam Zhang, please be more forgiving.

23
00:01:35,363 --> 00:01:36,334
Stop being a hypocrite.

24
00:01:39,172 --> 00:01:39,610
Sister,

25
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,960
it's right that you scold me.

26
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:43,916
Why must you lecture Madam Sheng too?

27
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,400
Now, you're crying and weeping.

28
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,300
Who are you trying to impress

29
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,240
with this pitiful act of yours?

30
00:01:50,191 --> 00:01:52,074
Madam Zhang, the banquet is about to start.

31
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,301
How about let's just go to the front courtyard

32
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,760
and listen to some southern opera?

33
00:01:56,008 --> 00:01:56,942
Let's just eat some fruits, drink some tea,

34
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,417
while we listen to it.

35
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,237
There's one southern opera

36
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,000
called "Suqin Returning Home in Glory".

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,880
Have you heard of it?

38
00:02:02,444 --> 00:02:03,050
Not returning to your homeland

39
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:03,461
after obtaining glory

40
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,680
is like walking at night with luxurious clothing.

41
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:06,209
This event you've organized

42
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,350
is exactly an act of returning home

43
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:07,960
in a glorious manner.

44
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:10,073
But if you want to show your might above my head,

45
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,600
Stop dreaming!

46
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,510
What might?

47
00:02:15,178 --> 00:02:16,440
All are just flattering words.

48
00:02:16,686 --> 00:02:18,000
You're the most gracious person.

49
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,800
Stop giving me

50
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,640
that fake smile.

51
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,400
I know exactly what you're thinking.

52
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,552
Look, look at all these people.

53
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,100
Coming from the mountains

54
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:27,975
and wilderness of the countryside.

55
00:02:27,975 --> 00:02:28,760
Just monkeys wearing a crown.

56
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,640
Just to preserve the status of the Zhou Family,

57
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,400
she'd rather be a concubine

58
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,500
just to be married into the Shen Family.

59
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,200
While you,

60
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,800
an illegitimate daughter,

61
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,278
has such a good fortune,

62
00:02:38,384 --> 00:02:39,125
hence, was able to climb a high branch

63
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:39,760
and become the wife of a marquis.

64
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,160
Yet you're here deceiving everyone,

65
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,225
being arrogant and tyrannical,

66
00:02:43,225 --> 00:02:44,000
disobedient and unfilial,

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,320
bullying your own mother-in-law.

68
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,520
You think that whole world

69
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,600
is blind or something?!

70
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,650
Sister-in-law, you must be drunk already.

71
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,560
She's the wife of Marquis Gu,

72
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,920
the best friend of my older brother.

73
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,440
Let me assist you to rest first.

74
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:56,920
Cuiwei,

75
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,360
assist Madam Zhang to rest.

76
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,160
Yes.

77
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,698
You dare to touch me?!

78
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,960
You group of people, a lair of snakes and rats.

79
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,211
Others might be afraid of your family's power

80
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,120
and dare not talk on behalf of Grand Madam Qin,

81
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:11,514
but I'm not!

82
00:03:12,417 --> 00:03:14,750
Okay, Sister-in-law. Don't be mad.

83
00:03:15,055 --> 00:03:15,800
What rumors have you heard?

84
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,920
What rotten rumors have you heard?

85
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,640
Big Madam,

86
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,050
Madam Sheng didn't offend you in any way!

87
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,760
Why must you

88
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,160
keep targeting her?!

89
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,097
Danju.

90
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,480
Assist Madam Zhou

91
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,640
to rest first.

92
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,150
Okay.

93
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,840
Let's go. Let's go.

94
00:03:32,365 --> 00:03:34,416
Madam, please don't be mad.

95
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,000
It's all my fault.

96
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,600
I'll just leave.

97
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,080
What are you doing?!

98
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,040
Let go!

99
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,550
Let go!

100
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,000
You dare to rebel?!

101
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,060
If there's anything, let's settle this amicably!

102
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,560
Sister-in-law!

103
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,240
She's young and insensible!

104
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,080
Just let it go!

105
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,089
Let go of her hand. Let go.

106
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,149
Stop fighting!

107
00:04:01,201 --> 00:04:02,590
She's young and insensible!

108
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,320
Stop! Stop!

109
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,360
Even you are defending her!

110
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,320
Quickly let go!

111
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,120
Stop! Stop!

112
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,000
Husband

113
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,000
The southern opera in front

114
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,151
is singing the "Mandarin Ducks Story".

115
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,600
You love that.

116
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,259
It's fine if others will watch it or not,

117
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,440
but don't you want to see it?

118
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,240
Go. Go. Everyone, let's go.

119
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,352
Everyone, please go!

120
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,360
Right. Right. Let's go.

121
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,840
The banquet has started.

122
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,080
Everyone, please quickly enter the banquet.

123
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,469
Let's go.

124
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,206
The sky has really

125
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,480
turned upside down.

126
00:04:58,653 --> 00:05:00,399
A concubine can also attend a major banquet!

127
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,675
This daughter-in-law of mine

128
00:05:02,675 --> 00:05:03,280
who is illegitimate by status,

129
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,880
has even become a wife of a marquis now.

130
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What concubine?

131
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,560
I've already come to accept these things.

132
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,878
Please don't worry,

133
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,600
You still will have the final say

134
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,480
here in the marquis manor.

135
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,929
Please don't worry.

136
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,880
It has now become a joke.

137
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,480
Little Sister Kang.

138
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,840
Although we only met recently,

139
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,920
we can really get along very well.

140
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,975
It's all thanks to you that

141
00:05:29,975 --> 00:05:31,080
these pent up frustrations of mine

142
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,600
are comforted.

143
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,167
I'm not that eloquent in speaking.

144
00:05:39,921 --> 00:05:41,200
But Fourth Miss Sheng

145
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,240
is quite educated and well-balan often.

146
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,280
You should see her more often.

147
00:05:45,536 --> 00:05:46,800
Stop mentioning those

148
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,160
illegitimate daughters already.

149
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,520
I'm already afraid of them.

150
00:05:52,321 --> 00:05:53,631
Every blink of theirs,

151
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,425
there are already a lot of

152
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,480
scheming going on in their mind.

153
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,040
Just one Sixth Miss Sheng here

154
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,194
in our house

155
00:05:59,598 --> 00:06:00,500
has already brought me so much trouble.

156
00:06:01,543 --> 00:06:02,577
If another one comes,.

157
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,280
I might go see

158
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,920
the God of Death sooner.

159
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,168
You're right.

160
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,800
We all are legitimate daughters

161
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,225
and we know how respectable

162
00:06:12,225 --> 00:06:12,560
and precious it is to be one.

163
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,080
But when we get swindled and framed

164
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,720
by lowly bitches like te grievances.

165
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,080
we are only left to endure all the grievances.

166
00:06:16,394 --> 00:06:18,265
When you look for people to grumble,

167
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,880
they'll say that you're not gracious enough.

168
00:06:21,116 --> 00:06:22,120
If you just swallow it down,

169
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,600
they really can eat you up.

170
00:06:25,898 --> 00:06:26,630
I heard that

171
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,800
the illegitimate daughters in your Kang Family

172
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,280
is quite obedient.

173
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,736
I'm the steward in our house.

174
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,760
If they aren't obedient,

175
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,080
won't I have lived in vain?

176
00:06:39,362 --> 00:06:43,560
Our family has very few male descendants.

177
00:06:45,178 --> 00:06:47,398
Unlike yours, you have so many children.

178
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,200
So lively.

179
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,710
How about this,

180
00:06:52,752 --> 00:06:53,764
In a few day,

181
00:06:54,367 --> 00:06:56,000
I'll bring over an obedient and sensible one,

182
00:06:56,271 --> 00:06:57,476
so your house can be lively too.

183
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,088
That will be great.

184
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,680
Good thing, you came.

185
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,730
Xiaotao!

186
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,080
Marquis knew that

187
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,850
Big Madam had a private meeting

188
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:23,360
with Young Lord Qi.

189
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,680
What?

190
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:26,800
What? This Big Madam

191
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,400
didn't really do anything.

192
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,200
How come Marquis

193
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,840
isn't letting her explain first?

194
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,640
What should I do?

195
00:07:32,997 --> 00:07:33,560
I surely help you

196
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,560
and put on good words for Big Madam.

197
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,440
Don't get agitated!

198
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,632
That Madam Zhang left grinding his teeth.

199
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,840
That Concubine Zou left crying and shouting.

200
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:44,750
I heard that the faces of all the people

201
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,243
during the banquet

202
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,080
were really bad.

203
00:07:47,808 --> 00:07:48,725
That Marquis Gu

204
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,360
is really very willful.

205
00:07:52,277 --> 00:07:53,400
There are so many legitimate

206
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,510
noble daughters in Bianjing,

207
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,320
but he has to choose an illegitimate one.

208
00:07:57,099 --> 00:07:58,875
Pitiful for that lady from a lower status family.

209
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,320
How could she have seen such a huge event before?

210
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,800
Although the matter isn't big,

211
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,000
just a fight between the harem,

212
00:08:05,803 --> 00:08:06,400
the ones being embarrassed here

213
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,760
are the people of Yuzhou.

214
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,800
I'm afraid that His Majesty

215
00:08:12,185 --> 00:08:13,915
His Majesty is the emperor of the empire,.

216
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,560
and not just by Yuzhou.

217
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:21,029
His Majesty knows this very well.

218
00:08:22,284 --> 00:08:24,757
General Shen is after all a State Uncle,

219
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,466
the biological younger brother of the Empress.

220
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,168
Let's not make it too hard on him.

221
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,240
Tomorrow,

222
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,720
when you greet for the morning,

223
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,309
go comfort the Empress.

224
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,160
Comfort the Empress?

225
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,960
I didn't manage the banquet today very well.

226
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,200
I'm afraid that I might have brought you shame.

227
00:09:09,252 --> 00:09:10,272
Chicken and bamboo shoots stew!

228
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,520
Father, this is your favorite!

229
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,120
Father, eat more!

230
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,920
You love this the most!

231
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,664
Eat properly.

232
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,400
Stop jumping around.

233
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,227
Does Marquis plan to keep being angry?

234
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,401
I'll assist you to get ready for bed.

235
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,000
Just mind yourself.

236
00:10:59,186 --> 00:11:00,402
Do you have something to say?

237
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,520
What should I be saying?

238
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,218
Go to morning court then.

239
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,020
Do you have anything you want to say?

240
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,006
There's nothing to say.

241
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,200
I know what you're mad about!

242
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,340
But since you saw it,

243
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,840
you should know

244
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,300
that I just asked Young Lord to put

245
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,520
down his hatred and grudges.

246
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,373
I didn't act beyond the rules.

247
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,000
I personally saw that

248
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,720
you didn't break any rules.

249
00:11:50,227 --> 00:11:52,181
Why then are you mad?

250
00:11:53,071 --> 00:11:54,301
But you told Yuanruo

251
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,120
to cherish the person by his side,

252
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,187
yet have you cherished me?

253
00:11:59,077 --> 00:12:00,120
yet have you cherished me?

254
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,880
What do you mean by getting me a concubine?

255
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,800
I was thinking for your sake, that's why,

256
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,720
I accepted her.

257
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,093
For my sake,

258
00:12:08,865 --> 00:12:10,039
you got me a concubine?

259
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:12,946
The adjacent courtyard is eyeing us covetously.

260
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,179
Your auntie got bewitched by her

261
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,625
and deliberately came to stifle me.

262
00:12:18,383 --> 00:12:20,079
First, I sent away those chamber servant of yours.

263
00:12:21,831 --> 00:12:23,235
Next, a Zhu Manniang came.

264
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:24,725
It even caused a ruckus

265
00:12:24,725 --> 00:12:25,634
that reached the imperial court.

266
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,832
If I refuse your auntie again,

267
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:30,760
then the two of them

268
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,240
will stop at nothing.

269
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:33,490
By then,

270
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,960
won't you still be the one to suppress it?!

271
00:12:36,367 --> 00:12:37,840
I am also just thinking

272
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,520
for your peace of mind.

273
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,394
You weren't thinking for my sake.

274
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,834
You're thinking for the sake of your husband,

275
00:12:44,675 --> 00:12:45,642
of the marquis!

276
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,331
Have you thought about my feelings?!

277
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,760
You never did!

278
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,480
You... But

279
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,457
But aren't you my husband?

280
00:12:57,988 --> 00:12:59,219
But I'm also your Darling Second.

281
00:13:01,784 --> 00:13:02,973
I'm also Zhonghuai.

282
00:13:04,287 --> 00:13:05,448
Can you think for my sake?

283
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:07,443
You are Darling Second.

284
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,560
You are Zhonghuai.

285
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,000
So?

286
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,425
You!

287
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,000
Shitou!

288
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,886
Marquis!

289
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,560
Are we going to the morning court now?

290
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,160
What morning court?!

291
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,969
I'm not in the mood to attend it!

292
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,395
Big Madam,

293
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,560
Marquis didn't return

294
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,360
and the palace is callinging on.

295
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,480
Don't know what's going on.

296
00:13:58,568 --> 00:13:59,583
Since we're here, take it easy.

297
00:14:01,251 --> 00:14:03,358
That Shitou.

298
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,360
So useless

299
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,120
when you need him.

300
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,430
Don't even know to urge Marquis

301
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,360
not to loiter around outside.

302
00:14:08,774 --> 00:14:09,731
Silly Xiaotao,

303
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,440
Shitou works under Marquis.

304
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,280
Of course, he listens to his command.

305
00:14:13,463 --> 00:14:15,555
Marquis, Marquis, always just Marquis.

306
00:14:15,707 --> 00:14:17,698
Don't even know to lessen my worries.

307
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,760
I won't eat

308
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,840
his fried cherries next time.

309
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,880
Those killers

310
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,151
thought that she was me.

311
00:14:34,425 --> 00:14:35,507
They killed her

312
00:14:37,922 --> 00:14:40,600
and even cut off her head

313
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,440
to take credit for the merit.

314
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,382
Hence, I was able to escape that disaster.

315
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,080
Hence, I got the chance

316
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,040
to sit on this throne.

317
00:15:07,354 --> 00:15:08,391
This throne of mine

318
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,222
was obtained in exchange for her life.

319
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:24,909
Sister-in-law died because of me.

320
00:15:27,588 --> 00:15:28,946
She also died for my little brother.

321
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:33,703
Now, our Shen family is enjoying wealth and glory.

322
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,432
But she

323
00:15:38,877 --> 00:15:40,577
won't be able to enjoy it anymore.

324
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,200
Hence

325
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,800
Hence, you and His Majesty

326
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,360
allowed General Shen

327
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,800
to take in the biological little sister

328
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,800
of Sister-in-law Shen as a concubine.

329
00:15:58,242 --> 00:15:59,526
Our Shen family

330
00:16:01,507 --> 00:16:02,866
owes the Zou Family one life.

331
00:16:05,004 --> 00:16:05,845
But now,

332
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,400
my little brother has a revered status.

333
00:16:11,382 --> 00:16:12,275
If we are to make a marriage alliance

334
00:16:12,275 --> 00:16:13,110
with the old aristocratic families,

335
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,750
only his State Uncle status

336
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,800
is worthy to be the husband

337
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,560
of the only daughter of Duke Ying of the State.

338
00:16:21,913 --> 00:16:23,569
I can now understand your predicament.

339
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,680
Little Zou is a nobility concubine,

340
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,480
the more she is a royal concubine.

341
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,120
Miss Zhang suffered grievances.

342
00:16:39,721 --> 00:16:42,026
With the two of them

343
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,200
fighting like that in your banquet,

344
00:16:44,138 --> 00:16:46,493
it caused you and Marquis Gu

345
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,160
embarrassment.

346
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,000
For my sake,

347
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,560
please don't put this matter to heart, okay?

348
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,000
Your Highness,

349
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,240
I can't bear such words from you.

350
00:17:03,261 --> 00:17:04,240
We came

351
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,960
from a small place like Yuzhou.

352
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,960
Sitting on this throne

353
00:17:10,811 --> 00:17:11,825
feels like sitting on top

354
00:17:11,825 --> 00:17:12,984
of a basin of charcoal fire.

355
00:17:14,378 --> 00:17:15,621
There's not one moment of peace.

356
00:17:17,148 --> 00:17:18,825
In the morning court, outside the morning court,

357
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,320
inside the palace, outside the palace,

358
00:17:20,827 --> 00:17:22,161
all are counting on us.

359
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,960
The Shen family are mostly people from Yuzhou.

360
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,680
For Madam Zhang to live among them,

361
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:33,885
her power indeed is too weak and too thin.

362
00:17:35,118 --> 00:17:36,796
Because of accumulating too much grudges,

363
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,840
it will...

364
00:17:41,546 --> 00:17:43,011
Of course, I know that.

365
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,528
I just'm afraid that

366
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,675
this good marriage alliance

367
00:17:46,675 --> 00:17:47,880
between an old and new court subjects

368
00:17:47,994 --> 00:17:49,187
would instead lead to bitter rivals.

369
00:17:52,098 --> 00:17:52,700
That will destabilize

370
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,573
the foundation of this empire.

371
00:17:54,675 --> 00:17:56,747
It will waver the government.

372
00:18:06,116 --> 00:18:07,534
If you will allow me,

373
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,240
I'm willing to

374
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,320
visit Madam Zhang.

375
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,120
Madam Sheng,

376
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,539
you have solved my major problem.

377
00:18:42,147 --> 00:18:43,880
Madam, I heard that the wife of the Marquis

378
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,200
is still waiting in the front receiving hall.

379
00:18:48,424 --> 00:18:49,796
It should have been an hour already.

380
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:52,711
She is really patient.

381
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,840
An illegitimate daughter

382
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,120
has been neglected a lot.

383
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,640
She must already got use to it.

384
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:06,586
Fine.

385
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,560
Marquis Gu

386
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,960
did come from Yuzhou too.

387
00:19:11,346 --> 00:19:12,190
I'll go over there

388
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,160
and give his wife some steps to go down to.

389
00:19:20,768 --> 00:19:22,440
Isn't she trying to drive the guest away?

390
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,680
How could an illustrious family like ours

391
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,080
drive our guests away?

392
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,270
Yes.

393
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,720
My Miss

394
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,360
can't even peacefully rest at home.

395
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,720
She just have to attend to people like this

396
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,800
who's here to laugh at her.

397
00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:36,019
Indeed.

398
00:19:40,161 --> 00:19:42,577
How about this? I'll go talk to her then.

399
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:44,255
Okay.

400
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:52,370
Madam, greetings.

401
00:19:52,815 --> 00:19:54,200
I received words from the inner courtyard

402
00:19:54,535 --> 00:19:55,500
that Big Madam is still not up

403
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,292
from her afternoon nap.

404
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm afraid that

405
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:58,650
you might need to sit here

406
00:19:58,650 --> 00:19:59,240
for a little more while.

407
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,600
If you have anything else to do,

408
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,080
why don't you go do it first?

409
00:20:04,893 --> 00:20:07,000
It must be tiring

410
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,170
for your Big Madam

411
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,480
She indeed should rest.

412
00:20:10,523 --> 00:20:11,513
I also have nothing else to do.

413
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,680
I really loved this tea of yours.

414
00:20:13,888 --> 00:20:14,838
I'll just enjoy a few cups more.

415
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,125
The kitchen has prepared some snacks

416
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:17,931
to accompany your tea.

417
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,520
If it's okay with you,

418
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,660
why don't you have a taste?

419
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,120
I'll try them then.

420
00:20:25,006 --> 00:20:26,712
I come here to greet Sister!

421
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:28,938
Oh, Madam Sheng, you're here.

422
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,360
How come no one informed me?

423
00:20:34,417 --> 00:20:35,520
Concubine Zou,

424
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,960
how many times have I told you that

425
00:20:37,084 --> 00:20:38,327
you should come less often

426
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,080
to the courtyard of Big Madam.

427
00:20:40,935 --> 00:20:41,880
I also don't know

428
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,080
what I've done wrong

429
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,480
that Big Madam hates me this much.

430
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,383
As a concubine,

431
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,840
isn't it just right

432
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,360
that I greet Sister?

433
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,800
Bur really great.

434
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,720
You're embarrassing me

435
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,000
in front of the Marquis' Wife.

436
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,630
Concubine Zou, you came at a bad time.

437
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,000
I was just about to leave.

438
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,640
My Sister has so much to do, hence, is exhausted.

439
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,920
Just let her rest first.

440
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,480
Why don't you

441
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,280
come to my place and sit for a while instead?

442
00:21:07,294 --> 00:21:08,474
I initially just came here in passing.

443
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,200
I still have to attend to some matters at home.

444
00:21:11,468 --> 00:21:13,722
Let me walk you out then!

445
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,200
My marquis husband

446
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,280
have met the older Madam Zou.

447
00:21:24,688 --> 00:21:25,375
When he mentions it,

448
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:26,760
he would usually have praises about her.

449
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,475
Every time he talks about her dying

450
00:21:28,475 --> 00:21:28,960
at such a young age

451
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,400
for the sake of the empress,

452
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,560
he would also uncontrollably .

453
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,800
shed a few tears.

454
00:21:36,584 --> 00:21:37,815
If my older sister is around,

455
00:21:38,373 --> 00:21:39,200
why would my family

456
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,320
be enduring humiliation like this?

457
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:45,542
For the older Madam Zou,

458
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,120
I must become a bit unpleasant

459
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,400
and lecture you a few things.

460
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,840
Madam Sheng,

461
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,680
you're the wife of Marquis.

462
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,200
You count as one of us already.

463
00:21:56,009 --> 00:21:56,737
Your words

464
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,600
are as pleasant as the call of a skylark.

465
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,960
How could I dislike it?

466
00:22:01,568 --> 00:22:02,100
Duke Ying of the State

467
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,014
is an important subject of the empire.

468
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,631
Madam Zhang is his only daughter.

469
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,520
For a legitimate wife like her,

470
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,785
she doesn't even

471
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,520
walk around her own courtyard a lot.

472
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,960
If not because my marquis husband

473
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,000
personally invited her,

474
00:22:13,575 --> 00:22:14,480
she most likely

475
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,600
won't go to our manor.

476
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,160
Didn't she still go?

477
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,640
And in front of everyone,

478
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,320
she made the situation unbearable.

479
00:22:24,925 --> 00:22:26,160
Now, all the wives of officials

480
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,040
are discussing

481
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,680
how she completely

482
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,720
embarrassed you.

483
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
As a concubine,

484
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,440
not only are you more ostentatious then me,

485
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,770
you even went to an official banquet.

486
00:22:37,347 --> 00:22:38,853
Not only am I completely embarrassed,

487
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,375
I might even get filed a complaint

488
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:41,040
in the imperial court.

489
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,720
Marquis Madam,

490
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,480
what do you mean by that?

491
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,808
Madam Zhang married into here

492
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,120
for the government's sake.

493
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,640
You were taken in as a concubine

494
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,520
for the sake of repaying an act of kindness.

495
00:22:54,438 --> 00:22:56,287
Both have deities as backers.

496
00:22:57,702 --> 00:22:58,600
Now, the Zhang Family

497
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,805
is willing to keep the peace.

498
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:01,825
She just chose to hide in her courtyard

499
00:23:01,825 --> 00:23:02,081
and not go out.

500
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,840
But how about you?

501
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,404
You talk and meddle in the household affairs.

502
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,475
Although one of lowly rank subduing

503
00:23:07,475 --> 00:23:08,280
someone higher than her is against proper logic,

504
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:10,478
as long as everyone is alright,

505
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,675
it's also a mark of a harmonious family

506
00:23:11,675 --> 00:23:12,234
with good progress.

507
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,600
If the fighting won't stop

508
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,160
and eventually led to too much confusion—

509
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,936
Her Zhang Family is a prominent family,

510
00:23:18,877 --> 00:23:20,514
but they are still subjects after all.

511
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,243
General is a State Uncle.

512
00:23:23,748 --> 00:23:26,346
His sister is the main wife of the emperor.

513
00:23:27,013 --> 00:23:29,200
With Empress and Prince Huan supporting me,

514
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,800
you think I'll be afraid of her?

515
00:23:34,449 --> 00:23:35,720
Everything in this world

516
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,200
must revolve around reason.

517
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,920
In dealing with others,

518
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,120
it's better that you don't commit a mistake.

519
00:23:41,425 --> 00:23:43,115
And just because others commit a mistake,

520
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,760
don't get dragged into making one too.

521
00:23:45,387 --> 00:23:46,000
Just like giving up on precious gems

522
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,640
just to settle with a woven weed sign.

523
00:23:46,913 --> 00:23:48,063
In the end,

524
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:48,825
you'll end up being the one

525
00:23:48,825 --> 00:23:49,640
without a mouth to talk about others.

526
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,100
Marquis Madam

527
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,200
are you saying that

528
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,608
you're siding with the Zhang family then?

529
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:02,300
That's right.

530
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,136
The Duke Ying of the State is powerful.

531
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,480
Who doesn't'm afraid them?

532
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,734
But I'm also not a lowly concubine

533
00:24:07,734 --> 00:24:09,252
that can just be tormented by others.

534
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,480
I have a conferred title.

535
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,800
You're the only concubine with a conferred title

536
00:24:17,477 --> 00:24:18,400
in this empire.

537
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,560
What great prestige.

538
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,177
But if you really get into trouble,

539
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,520
who'll suffer the brunt of the punishment?

540
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:27,877
Will it be Madam Zhang?

541
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:29,534
Of course, it will also not be State Uncle Shen.

542
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,951
You and your husband are really of one heart.

543
00:24:34,285 --> 00:24:35,440
Marquis

544
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,960
has just finished convincing General earlier.

545
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,489
Now, you're here to convince me.

546
00:24:39,379 --> 00:24:41,329
My husband was here?

547
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,480
Those who doesn't know

548
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,600
would think that

549
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,200
you've been eating rice from the Zhang Family.

550
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,690
Marquis is really so considerate.

551
00:24:56,722 --> 00:24:57,752
So, this is where he went.

552
00:24:59,684 --> 00:25:00,290
Big Madam!

553
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,600
Big Madam, please come to our courtyard

554
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,160
and have some tea.

555
00:25:09,558 --> 00:25:10,761
Big Madam, please sit down.

556
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:19,212
My head ache

557
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,440
and was too lazy to get up from bed.

558
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,400
I thought that

559
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,160
you came here to laugh at me,

560
00:25:25,588 --> 00:25:26,801
hence, I didn't want to see you.

561
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,469
The nanny that serves me said

562
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,800
that you can understand me.

563
00:25:32,066 --> 00:25:33,158
What's the use

564
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,680
even if you do?

565
00:25:35,523 --> 00:25:37,524
Big Madam, health is more important.

566
00:25:39,502 --> 00:25:40,680
Your Marquis Gu.

567
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,960
started his career in Yuzhou.

568
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,346
You also know the details in between

569
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,040
right?

570
00:25:46,651 --> 00:25:47,813
I don't know it that well.

571
00:25:48,702 --> 00:25:49,489
But no matter what,

572
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,240
all are just material objects.

573
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,200
If your health is bad,

574
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,960
no matter how rich you are,

575
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,990
it's still no fun.

576
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,920
No need for you to urge me.

577
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,400
Tell the palace and those outside

578
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,115
of it to be at ease.

579
00:26:04,176 --> 00:26:05,320
As long as that Third Miss Zou

580
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,360
can steady herself,

581
00:26:06,713 --> 00:26:08,229
I will also not trouble anyone!

582
00:26:10,129 --> 00:26:11,344
No need to flog them each 50 times.

583
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,120
I know how you people outside

584
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:14,840
are thinking.

585
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,160
The Shen Family married me from the Zhang Family,

586
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,400
and took in a Zhou woman as a concubine.

587
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,050
Initially not caring about how his past wife

588
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:21,720
shared hardships with him,

589
00:26:21,944 --> 00:26:23,720
but then later cared for others to say that

590
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,760
they know to repay an act of kindness.

591
00:26:25,472 --> 00:26:26,800
He wants the left one,

592
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,700
but also want to be good with the one

593
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,000
on the right.

594
00:26:28,696 --> 00:26:30,111
Of course, he ended up being in a dilemma.

595
00:26:31,849 --> 00:26:34,012
If you find this matter hard,

596
00:26:35,114 --> 00:26:35,990
the one benefiting

597
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,560
are generally the men,

598
00:26:38,358 --> 00:26:39,470
and the one suffering.

599
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,040
are the women.

600
00:26:42,623 --> 00:26:43,542
Look at that plum.

601
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,121
It's so stubborn.

602
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,560
I watered and gave it fertilizers

603
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,594
but it just won't blossom.

604
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,320
The gardener got annoyed since a year ago,

605
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,800
and stop caring for them.

606
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,560
But in winter,

607
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,720
it blossomed on its own.

608
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:02,453
Living in a natural manner,

609
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,920
I might be able to continue living.

610
00:27:09,134 --> 00:27:10,124
Since it's able to blossom,

611
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,680
then it can keep blossoming.

612
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:13,900
Blossom and bear fruit.

613
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,299
Luscious leaves and branches.

614
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,400
If it can choose,

615
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,960
it surely won't choose

616
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,480
to stay inside this room.

617
00:27:22,718 --> 00:27:23,991
If it can choose,

618
00:27:25,548 --> 00:27:26,400
I also don't want

619
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,960
to be like an item

620
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,080
and married into this family.

621
00:27:36,877 --> 00:27:39,222
By my grandmother side in my maiden house,

622
00:27:40,112 --> 00:27:41,365
there's a close attendant

623
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,200
with a surname Fang.

624
00:27:44,892 --> 00:27:46,065
Since I was little, she told me that

625
00:27:47,055 --> 00:27:47,960
whether you're a man or a woman,

626
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,040
if you want to live well,

627
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:54,680
it's only fate, luck, and abilities.

628
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,880
As long as you're able to get two out of three,

629
00:27:58,284 --> 00:27:59,784
your life will surely go smoothly.

630
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:01,825
Big Madam,

631
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,040
you were born in the Ducal House of Ying,

632
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,840
a highly prominent family.

633
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:06,920
You can be said

634
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,120
to have the best kind of reincarnation.

635
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,680
Nanny Fang, on the other hand,

636
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,000
didn't get reincarnated to a good family.

637
00:28:16,032 --> 00:28:19,165
She initially was so poor and barely surviving.

638
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,000
From seven years old onward,

639
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,040
she was unable to eat a full meal.

640
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:26,240
She wasn't able to wear

641
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,320
a complete clothing.

642
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,440
She can only be sold,

643
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,360
so the house can have some

644
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,000
rice and salt.

645
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,955
A hardship like that

646
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,800
is unimaginable for people

647
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,080
like us.

648
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,120
In the end,

649
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,680
she got sold to your house.

650
00:28:47,818 --> 00:28:48,686
Right

651
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,500
Since she started working

652
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,400
by my grandmother's side,

653
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,520
she learned to embroider, comb hair,

654
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,040
read accounting books, and manage matters.

655
00:28:56,753 --> 00:28:58,704
She learned them one by one,

656
00:28:58,930 --> 00:28:59,920
Slowly walking towards

657
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,400
by grandmother's side

658
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,120
until she became a top level female attendant.

659
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,480
Afterwards,

660
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,240
my grandmother released her slave contract.

661
00:29:07,092 --> 00:29:07,911
She got married

662
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,520
and even had two sons.

663
00:29:11,796 --> 00:29:13,200
This nanny of yours.

664
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,560
has such great luck.

665
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,480
It must be good people gets good karma.

666
00:29:18,544 --> 00:29:20,075
Her life can be said to have

667
00:29:20,075 --> 00:29:21,202
ended quite perfectly.

668
00:29:22,342 --> 00:29:24,040
She wasn't reincarnated into a good family,

669
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,160
but was able to strive into

670
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,600
obtaining a good scene like that.

671
00:29:27,781 --> 00:29:29,925
Big Madam, you're a precious daughter

672
00:29:29,925 --> 00:29:31,005
with noble status.

673
00:29:31,844 --> 00:29:32,837
Why must you

674
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:33,830
be dispirited and lock yourself in this room,

675
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,675
just watching the clouds move

676
00:29:35,675 --> 00:29:36,600
and the flowers wither?

677
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,526
In living our days,

678
00:29:41,335 --> 00:29:42,420
only after you've lived it for a long time

679
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,080
can you know if it's bitter or a happy one.

680
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,200
You've already married here.

681
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,087
Being bitter or being happy

682
00:29:50,087 --> 00:29:52,119
will be for a lifetime.

683
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,400
If you will just be in distressed

684
00:29:55,384 --> 00:29:58,120
and resent your life daily,

685
00:29:59,265 --> 00:30:00,285
you then would really

686
00:30:00,285 --> 00:30:01,800
get trapped in this distress.

687
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:05,834
Why don't you become like Nanny Fang,

688
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,800
and strive to move forward?

689
00:30:11,191 --> 00:30:12,939
Strive to move forward.

690
00:30:20,004 --> 00:30:21,069
Little Sister,

691
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,040
you look younger than me by a few years,

692
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,816
but you're more sensible than me.

693
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,400
Those words that they say about you outside

694
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:31,971
are all lies.

695
00:30:33,871 --> 00:30:34,880
You can try to control the sky or the earth,

696
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,280
but can never control the mouth of people.

697
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,350
As they say, you can see a person's true heart

698
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:39,920
as days go by.

699
00:30:57,208 --> 00:30:58,617
Old Shen.

700
00:31:07,148 --> 00:31:08,520
How come I can't remarry a lady

701
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,680
from the Zou family?!

702
00:31:10,387 --> 00:31:12,247
So what if I'm willing to give this power

703
00:31:12,914 --> 00:31:14,936
and splendor to the Zou family?!

704
00:31:18,908 --> 00:31:19,993
Old Shen,

705
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,400
wake up!

706
00:31:23,284 --> 00:31:25,386
You think

707
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:26,760
you're still in Yuzhou?

708
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,000
You think you're still that normal soldier,

709
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,360
with only a few money in your pocket,

710
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,400
and just a hundred men under you?

711
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,360
It's not like that anymore.

712
00:31:34,836 --> 00:31:35,560
You are now

713
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,480
the distinguished State Uncle.

714
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,875
The vanguard who saved the emperor

715
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:39,600
and pacified the rebels.

716
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,720
Conferred the title Weibei Great General.

717
00:31:41,931 --> 00:31:43,831
This is already the capital city.

718
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,733
It's not Yuzhuo.

719
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,920
It's not Yuzhou anymore.

720
00:32:02,711 --> 00:32:04,650
If that

721
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:06,589
Third Miss Zou

722
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,960
is just like the deceased Sister-in-law Zou,

723
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,720
why do I still need to talk to you?

724
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,920
Why are you still

725
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,120
drinking here and smashing items?

726
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,320
It's exactly because she's bossy and domineering,

727
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:19,925
a concubine riding over the main wife,

728
00:32:19,925 --> 00:32:21,070
a servant offending her superior,

729
00:32:21,217 --> 00:32:23,087
hence, your harem is a complete mess.

730
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,760
and your home is in conflict.

731
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,840
If you still don't wake up,

732
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,480
this matter will surely incite future trouble.

733
00:32:30,566 --> 00:32:32,416
Stop following my footsteps.

734
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,080
Stop jumping into that pit.

735
00:32:37,358 --> 00:32:38,175
I'm willing to fall into

736
00:32:38,175 --> 00:32:38,998
the pit of the Zou Family.

737
00:32:39,733 --> 00:32:41,411
I'm willing to die in that pit.

738
00:32:43,938 --> 00:32:46,970
Zhonghuai, I don't want to come to Bianjing.

739
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,160
I have nothing.

740
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,120
I have nothing anymore!

741
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,650
You and deceased Sister-in-law Zou

742
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:00,560
were so much in love.

743
00:33:03,491 --> 00:33:04,131
You're better than me.

744
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,958
Your wife

745
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,600
is way outstanding than her.

746
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,160
I clearly understand that

747
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:13,975
she's trying to patch the relationship

748
00:33:13,975 --> 00:33:14,520
between me and Miss Zhang.

749
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,680
Thank her for me.

750
00:33:20,171 --> 00:33:22,577
Miss Zhang is a very straightforward person.

751
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,750
She doesn't like to put people

752
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:25,280
in a difficult spot.

753
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:29,142
It's just that

754
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,520
That main wife of yours is so smart and unclouded.

755
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:34,594
You must treat her well.

756
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:37,501
Don't be like me.

757
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,143
I can't turn back anymore.

758
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,200
My wife can understand everything thoroughly,

759
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:47,177
except when it comes to love,

760
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,744
she's like a three-year old child.

761
00:33:51,341 --> 00:33:52,840
I'm also just

762
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,800
deceiving myself.

763
00:34:03,186 --> 00:34:04,372
How can we solve our problem?

764
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,440
Only through Du Kang.

765
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,600
Come.

766
00:34:10,939 --> 00:34:12,525
You've smashed the cups already.

767
00:34:13,395 --> 00:34:15,082
What will you use to drink the wine?

768
00:34:19,196 --> 00:34:20,227
Come.

769
00:34:25,169 --> 00:34:27,130
Even for the matters of the Shen Family,

770
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,050
they sought the help of

771
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:30,480
the Gu husband and wife?

772
00:34:31,385 --> 00:34:33,619
Marquis Madam almost didn't get in

773
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,387
the doors of Madam Zhang.

774
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,120
She was already being walked out of the manor,

775
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,560
but then got called back again

776
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,680
to have some tea.

777
00:34:40,906 --> 00:34:41,785
How long was the tea?

778
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,080
It wasn't that long.

779
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,440
But after Marquis Madam Gu left,

780
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,880
Madam Zhang immediately called people

781
00:34:49,638 --> 00:34:51,043
to bring all

782
00:34:51,043 --> 00:34:52,317
her polo outfits out.

783
00:34:58,623 --> 00:35:00,534
In sending out the palace maids last time,

784
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,320
I've already seen

785
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,520
the skill of that Marquis Madam Gu.

786
00:35:04,506 --> 00:35:07,629
Looks like, the two of them

787
00:35:08,649 --> 00:35:10,196
are the emperor's helpers.

788
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,640
Prince Huan was really right

789
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,040
in making this friend.

790
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,720
Buy one, take one.

791
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,360
So worth it.

792
00:35:42,184 --> 00:35:43,238
Don't be afraid.

793
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,409
Horses are the most docile animal.

794
00:35:46,389 --> 00:35:46,904
Let's go.

795
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,524
You can't call him like that.

796
00:36:04,935 --> 00:36:05,880
Quickly look.

797
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,120
This horse kept deliberately making me fall.

798
00:36:09,635 --> 00:36:10,868
Can you see it or not?

799
00:36:19,378 --> 00:36:20,126
Shitou!

800
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,240
Madam, catch the club!

801
00:36:43,948 --> 00:36:45,778
Sheng Sixth, you're a rascal!

802
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,400
It's just a game.

803
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,280
Don't be mad.

804
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,080
You're still laughing?

805
00:36:53,975 --> 00:36:55,400
The competition hasn't started

806
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,600
and the price hasn't been set yet.

807
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,680
You couple

808
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,040
are teaming to bully my wife.

809
00:36:59,877 --> 00:37:00,938
You think there's no more person in my house?

810
00:37:02,191 --> 00:37:03,280
While in Yuzhou,

811
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,680
you already couldn't beat me in polo.

812
00:37:04,967 --> 00:37:06,360
Whether there is a price or not,

813
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,920
I will be the victor.

814
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,950
What's the use of officially

815
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:09,800
starting the game or not?

816
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,230
Gu Second,

817
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,560
you're so arrogant.

818
00:37:13,986 --> 00:37:15,674
You think I still can't beat you

819
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,160
after so many years have passed?

820
00:37:17,594 --> 00:37:18,544
If you can beat me,

821
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,560
I'll give you that spear of mine.

822
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:23,072
You can bear to?

823
00:37:24,214 --> 00:37:25,160
You really think

824
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,000
you can beat me?

825
00:37:28,217 --> 00:37:28,920
Where's the spear?

826
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,520
Shitou!

827
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,000
Yes.

828
00:37:35,797 --> 00:37:37,004
Hang that price over there.

829
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,080
Let me battle you today

830
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,440
and steal that spear of yours away!

831
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,600
Not only the Marquis Gu.

832
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,840
Marquis Madam Gu too.

833
00:37:45,762 --> 00:37:47,157
You two are battling together?

834
00:37:47,157 --> 00:37:49,560
I've won over him twice.

835
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,000
You dare to fight me?

836
00:37:53,575 --> 00:37:54,995
You were able to defeat Zhonghuai?

837
00:37:56,072 --> 00:37:56,920
When she was seven,

838
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,880
she already beat me in touhu.

839
00:37:58,477 --> 00:37:59,680
During a polo match,

840
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,680
she won over me once more.

841
00:38:01,105 --> 00:38:01,924
If you don't believe it,

842
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,600
you can go ask these ladies,

843
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,160
I'm sure they still remember.

844
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,720
I still remember.

845
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,920
The price that time was a golden hairpin.

846
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,840
Wife, are you interested to fight with me?

847
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,360
Since I'm already here,

848
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,200
why not?

849
00:38:19,914 --> 00:38:20,526
Okay!

850
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,000
I must get

851
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,200
that precious red spear

852
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,240
of yours today!

853
00:38:42,301 --> 00:38:43,281
Start of a new game!

854
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,560
The price for this round

855
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:49,153
is a Black Gold Tiger Head Long Spear!

856
00:38:54,581 --> 00:38:55,784
Release the ball!

857
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,540
Good! Good! General Shen!

858
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,640
General Shen! You were great!

859
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,690
Good! Good!

860
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,423
General,

861
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,400
this is a good spear.

862
00:40:31,406 --> 00:40:32,220
I didn't know

863
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,760
that you can play such good polo.

864
00:40:37,783 --> 00:40:38,548
You don't know a lot

865
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,880
about me yet.

866
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:09,875
Looks like today, the cooking of

867
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:10,843
the breakfast chef today

868
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,400
is really not bad.

869
00:41:12,683 --> 00:41:13,840
Marquis Husband is still eating until now

870
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,160
and hasn't left for the court yet.

871
00:41:20,132 --> 00:41:22,092
A few days ago, Madam Zhang came to visit me.

872
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,100
She said that State Uncle is now frequently

873
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,480
talking to her about military strategy books.

874
00:41:26,196 --> 00:41:27,651
The two are really getting along very well.

875
00:41:30,117 --> 00:41:31,566
It looks like

876
00:41:31,566 --> 00:41:33,040
the Shen Manor will be more peaceful now.

877
00:41:36,394 --> 00:41:37,210
It's good if it will be.

878
00:41:41,437 --> 00:41:42,417
Did Fengxian provide you

879
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:43,520
with any trouble?

880
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:45,490
I've already told her

881
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,840
not to move around too much.

882
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:48,734
She surely will not disturb you.

883
00:41:53,474 --> 00:41:54,354
You decide.

884
00:41:56,143 --> 00:41:56,678
Marquis.

885
00:42:00,256 --> 00:42:01,787
I've mended the damaged part.

886
00:42:06,037 --> 00:42:06,646
No need.

887
00:42:07,968 --> 00:42:09,201
You're not going to the morning court again?

888
00:42:24,483 --> 00:42:25,602
Big Madam,

889
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,720
Marquis kept saying strange words

890
00:42:28,333 --> 00:42:29,496
these past two months.

891
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,640
I really can't understand it anymore.

892
00:42:32,851 --> 00:42:35,206
Why don't we go ask Old Madam?

893
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,040
I just answered back

894
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,400
to my father at our house a few months ago.

895
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:43,080
If I go nag about this

896
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,120
to Grandmother now,.

897
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,040
won't that

898
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,240
only make her mad.

899
00:42:47,244 --> 00:42:47,907
What do we do then?

900
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,560
But Marquis is also

901
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,800
not really going anywhere else.

902
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,289
He doesn't enter even

903
00:42:55,289 --> 00:42:56,380
the courtyard of Concubine Qian.

904
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:01,343
Anyway, Marquis is still by my side.

905
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,720
Let's just make do and let it pass.

906
00:43:07,286 --> 00:43:08,311
But Miss,

907
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,920
Marquis used to be a straightforward person

908
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,160
who likes to laugh

909
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,000
or get mad.

910
00:43:12,936 --> 00:43:15,402
Now, he has been cold for too long.

911
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,160
Aren't you worry?

912
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:25,880
I feel that

913
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,440
this house is so empty.

914
00:43:31,452 --> 00:43:32,421
That's right.

915
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,760
When Marquis comes home,

916
00:43:34,292 --> 00:43:35,840
he doesn't joke with us

917
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,400
or bring us good food anymore.

918
00:43:38,567 --> 00:43:39,450
It's not as lively as before here inside the room.

919
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,520
That's right. It's not lively anymore.

920
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:49,098
Madam, Madam Zhang is here.
