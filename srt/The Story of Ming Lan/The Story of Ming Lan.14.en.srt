1
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,875
Episode 14

3
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,320
So many people.

4
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,120
What's going on?

5
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,570
Can't you tell?

6
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,160
The family is out to catch them.

7
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,719
A man and a woman.

8
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,850
What do you think happened?

9
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,240
Look at that man.

10
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,400
He doesn't look someone who committed adultery

11
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,960
with the Mistress?

12
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,280
Both are dressed properly and tidy.

13
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,560
If they were really committing adultery,

14
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,070
they wouldn't be at Fan House.

15
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,040
How about giving him a beating

16
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,620
and throwing him out in the western outskirts?

17
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,525
He won't know

18
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,030
what's happened anyway.

19
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,320
Throw him out at the western outskirts

20
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,980
and he might go report to the precinct.

21
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,920
Just keep him confined for now

22
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,660
and we'll deal with him later.

23
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,600
If Big Madam doesn't come to pick him up

24
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,490
no one can see him.

25
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,920
Old Madam!

26
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,760
That Big Madam,

27
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,600
she

28
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,850
Is there bad news about Hong'er?

29
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,198
No news of the Master yet.

30
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,080
It's Big Madam.

31
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,000
She has Mistress Lin bound,

32
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,920
saying she went out and stole..!

33
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,320
Stole?

34
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,350
She stole a man?

35
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,600
Grandmother!

36
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,760
Grandmother!

37
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,520
Big Madam,

38
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,600
the testimony is complete now.

39
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,680
When Old Madam sees it,

40
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,174
there's nothing wrong with it

41
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,480
Hurry.

42
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,600
Get a broker

43
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
and sell her off!

44
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,450
Yes.

45
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,680
Mother!

46
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,640
What are you doing?

47
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,450
Are you all dead? Come in!

48
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,400
Stop!

49
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,160
I'm

50
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,760
wrongly accused.

51
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,000
Big Madam, I got framed!

52
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,760
This is the house of an official in the capital.

53
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:38,480
The concubine dares to attack

54
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,240
within the Big Madam's courtyard?

55
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,120
Big Madam,

56
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,520
I'm innocent! I'm innocent!

57
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,060
You all are trying to frame my mother to her death!

58
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,200
Dream on!

59
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,280
Your Ladyship

60
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,590
I'm just one body.

61
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,076
If you hate me well, that's that,

62
00:03:53,076 --> 00:03:56,100
but why do you want to frame me to death?

63
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,190
Back then, you came to me with your pregnant belly.

64
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,240
Came into my home,

65
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,028
and forced me to drink your tea as the concubine.

66
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,190
You shameless thing!

67
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,290
Why would Nanny Liu frame you?

68
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,280
You're all spewing nonsense!

69
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,820
You wanted to force a confession by torture!

70
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,880
Stow it!

71
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,720
Nanny Liu personally saw you

72
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,260
meeting an outside man in secret.

73
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,680
Pulling on and grabbing each other, hands all over!

74
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,320
Mother already knows too.

75
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,320
If you want to cry for your innocence,

76
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,400
go and do it to her then!

77
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,280
Even if I go to Old Madam's

78
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,160
I'm the same.

79
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,400
I'm being framed!

80
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,491
Fine. You said it was not an adulterous meeting with a man.

81
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,760
Then why did you meet a man in secret?

82
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,400
All clear and honest.

83
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,760
If you don't believe me,

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,400
go call that landlord here.

85
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
We'll talk face to face!

86
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,480
Call him. Call him!

87
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,840
Get that landlord here.

88
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,360
We'll get to the bottom

89
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,050
of this face to face!

90
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,040
What? Why aren't you willing to let him come talk?

91
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,120
What?

92
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,180
Why aren't you willing to let him come to talk?

93
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,440
How preposterous!

94
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,160
This isn't a place

95
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,320
for you to speak.

96
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,960
Mother, let us go back.

97
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,800
Let's not talk to her anymore.

98
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,240
We'll wait for Father to get back

99
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,972
and he'll see to it.

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,720
Fourth Miss.

101
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,320
This is to handle

102
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,400
your concubine mother's adultery case.

103
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,280
You're a maiden

104
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,200
who's not married yet.

105
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,960
It is not proper for you to linger here.

106
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,600
Attendants! Escort Fourth Miss back.

107
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,160
No, no.

108
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,600
Where's Mother?

109
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,760
Where is the honorable Minister's Mother?

110
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,200
Grandmother says

111
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,440
this is a shame to the family.

112
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,280
She fainted upon getting angry.

113
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,190
Currently, she's being looked at by the physician

114
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,400
and she sent me to deliver her words.

115
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,160
You can deliver her words?

116
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,480
Grandmother says

117
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,280
this matter is all up

118
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,200
Big Madam.

119
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,800
If Mistress Lin

120
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,480
really committed a shameful act defying virtue,

121
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,800
she is not to be forgiven easily.

122
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,200
Sheng Minglan, you're spewing nonsense!

123
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,680
Yes, yes.

124
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,864
Daughter-in-law shall honor Mother's teaching.

125
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,720
I've been framed. Framed!

126
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,400
Once His Lordship is back,

127
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,200
I'll see what happens to you!

128
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,760
You shameless thing.

129
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,120
You dare to mention His Lordship?

130
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,080
If he knew you committed such shameful acts

131
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,800
of adultery and theft, he'd still shield you?

132
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,440
Big Madam,

133
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,680
you are dying to get rid of me.

134
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,320
Old Madam is suddenly unable to come from illness.

135
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,880
These two matters are so coincidental,

136
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,920
like

137
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,920
it was planned!

138
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,800
That filthy mouth of yours.

139
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,760
Daring to slander Old Madam.

140
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,640
Big Madam, hurry and sell her off,

141
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,760
so she doesn't dirty up your courtyard.

142
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,480
Mother. Mother!

143
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,120
Sixth Miss, since you're not married,

144
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,520
you really

145
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,680
shouldn't linger.

146
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,720
Big Madam, Minglan takes her leave.

147
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,720
Is he inside?

148
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,800
Move.

149
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,480
You can't go in.

150
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,840
Do you know who I am?

151
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,800
How dare you stop me.

152
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,440
Save me!

153
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,200
Third Young Master.

154
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,000
Help

155
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,800
Open the door!

156
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,880
Help

157
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,560
Let me go!

158
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,440
I didn't know before,

159
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,800
that the one you're selling is actually the concubine.

160
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:18,800
What?

161
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,320
How long have you been

162
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,960
in this broker business?

163
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,960
Which large household's

164
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,680
concubines haven't you sold?

165
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,400
Please let your anger dissipate.

166
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,560
I've seen this mistress.

167
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,840
I know she's

168
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,760
esteemed by the lordship.

169
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,280
I fear once he returns home and doesn't see her,

170
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,440
his anger will be on me and he'll blame me.

171
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,000
She stole a man behind the husband's back!

172
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,600
My Minister will only thank you for removing

173
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,320
a great grudge upon his heart,

174
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,080
why could he blame you?

175
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
It seems, Broker Zhang,

176
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,400
you deem

177
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,560
I am not the boss here.

178
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,600
Forget it then.

179
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,000
You're not the only broker in the capital.

180
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,680
From now on,

181
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,840
you won't need to do our Sheng House's business.

182
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,440
And my Wang family's business?

183
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,560
Forget that too.

184
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,040
Also, Yuan House and Wu House.

185
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,680
I hear there's

186
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,760
a rival in business for you.

187
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,640
A woman by the surname Lu?

188
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,200
Do you think she dares to

189
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,400
take on this business of mine?

190
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,280
You're right, Big Madam.

191
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,960
I was foolish.

192
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,400
How about I take a look at her disposition,

193
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,320
and we can draw up

194
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,400
the contract together?

195
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,200
Young Master!

196
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,400
Help me! You two sirs,

197
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,560
this is about my mother's life.

198
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,480
Take pity!

199
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,480
Young Master.

200
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,320
You can't.

201
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,400
Young Master.

202
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,680
Untie me!

203
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,040
You can't, Young Master.

204
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,160
Untie me!

205
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,520
Hurts so much.

206
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,360
Wang Ruofu

207
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,880
Damn you

208
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,320
You want to take advantage of Master

209
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,360
going out to harm me.

210
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,080
As always, when you catch adultery, you catch the pair.

211
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,640
Go call that adulterer out,

212
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,800
and we'll testify face to face.

213
00:09:39,372 --> 00:09:41,080
The Kaifeng precinct.

214
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,160
I'm going with you!

215
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,680
Broker Zhang,

216
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,720
if you dare

217
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,960
to take my slave contract,

218
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,200
then you wait until the Master is back.

219
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,360
He'll pull out

220
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,360
your tendons and skin you!

221
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,720
Well.

222
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,200
Big Madam。

223
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,360
Then, maybe you should find the man to testify?

224
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,920
So I can do this at ease too

225
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,520
The confirmation is here.

226
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,400
You can't go in.

227
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,160
Get out of my way!

228
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,080
You can't go in.

229
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,120
Come

230
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,080
Get out of my way!

231
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,320
Slower.

232
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,080
Get out of my way!

233
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,080
Slower.

234
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,940
You！What ridicule!

235
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,680
This is the lady's boudoir!

236
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,800
You two males barging in here!

237
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,680
How improper!

238
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,520
It's a matter of honor and life .

239
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,960
and I can't care about that now.

240
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,240
This is Landlord Xu that was engaged in

241
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,840
a shop purchase transaction with my mother.

242
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,560
You can ask him whether she stole a man

243
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,360
and committed adultery!

244
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,840
What nonsense!

245
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,160
This lady and I were

246
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,440
just talking business innocently.

247
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,400
First, since it was just the maidservant

248
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,320
delivering the message,

249
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,400
I felt uneasy

250
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,414
so she finally consented to come

251
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,280
and meet me after turning me down multiple times.

252
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,400
And you

253
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,120
people bound me here.

254
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,400
I mean,

255
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,320
have you no law?

256
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,320
Have you no law?

257
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,560
What business are you talking about?

258
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,400
What business?

259
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,960
Shop and farm field business.

260
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,640
Then, do you have the signed contract?

261
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,396
We were in the middle of talking it over

262
00:10:59,396 --> 00:11:02,156
and you people came in and bound me.

263
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,200
What signed contract?

264
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,960
Then you don't have it.

265
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,760
"Talking business"?

266
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,840
You used to "talk poetry" with my Minister

267
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,280
and your belly

268
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,880
got big.

269
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,960
Now you claim to "talk business".

270
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,560
I think you're handing the family shop

271
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,080
and land to your lover!

272
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,480
Speak prudently,

273
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,280
Big Madam!

274
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,920
Child. What do you fear?

275
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,440
Your name is Sheng

276
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,840
and I will acknowledge you.

277
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,120
Just that you have a birth mother like her,

278
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,240
so your future official career might be hard to keep.

279
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,920
You jealous woman!

280
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,560
You want to have me killed.

281
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,280
No matter how low my status as concubine is,

282
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,720
my son is still registered

283
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,640
on the Sheng genealogy!

284
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,760
You can't just frame

285
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,280
and ruin me like this.

286
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,120
You want to hang these crimes on me?

287
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,680
Then we'll go back to the hometown in Youyang

288
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,480
and invite the clan elders.

289
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,640
Hold the clan court and sentence right and wrong.

290
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,440
Then I'll be content,

291
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,720
whether I'm to beaten or punished!

292
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,960
"Clan court"? To go and disturb

293
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,600
Sheng elders over the ugly matter

294
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,320
of a whore like you?

295
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,616
You hold yourself in too high esteem.

296
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,360
Won't disturb the elders?

297
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,920
Then we'll have to disturb the officials.

298
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,560
You don't care about losing face.

299
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,800
Fine.

300
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,879
We'll go to the grand hall at Kaifeng precinct

301
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,537
and talk reason.

302
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,440
Sheng Changfeng,

303
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,280
go and hit the grievance drum now!

304
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,040
Go on.

305
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,920
Stop him!

306
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,760
Let him go!

307
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,760
If the folks at

308
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,600
Kaifeng Precinct aren't blind,

309
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,000
they will never hear

310
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,800
the testimony of a concubine!

311
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,240
Even if we go to court, you still won't win!

312
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,520
Big Madam,

313
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,200
let's not have this matter go outside.

314
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,320
This merchant

315
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,160
might not listen to us either.

316
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,160
But it's a fact that the man and the woman

317
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:47,960
met secretly in a room.

318
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,214
She can't explain that to clear herself,

319
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,400
Once this alarms the government office

320
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,025
and Master comes back,

321
00:12:53,025 --> 00:12:53,720
the one he's going to deal with is surely you.

322
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,600
It won't be that whore.

323
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,920
What's the difference to me now

324
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,680
whether he deals or not?

325
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,480
It's not like he can divorce me!

326
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,680
If you can

327
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,320
nail the whore to death today,

328
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,080
then you can sleep

329
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,280
soundly in the future.

330
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,520
Yes.

331
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,920
Sleep soundly.

332
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,120
What's happened?

333
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,960
Big Madam can't handle it.

334
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,680
Mistress Lin says she will go to the Kaifeng Precinct

335
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,840
to report to

336
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,680
the government office.

337
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,680
Big Madam actually

338
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,680
said to go ahead.

339
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,840
What? Have they left?

340
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,400
Two servants went to Kaifeng Precinct

341
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,640
to sound the drum.

342
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,600
They've already left.

343
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,160
How can they go to the precinct?

344
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,320
They must be stopped.

345
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,880
Big Madam says not to stop them.

346
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,280
We just said

347
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,400
Old Madam

348
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,680
was ill.

349
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,600
So we can't just send someone now.

350
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,960
Is Changbai home?

351
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,560
Second Young Master is currently discussing

352
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,640
with Second Young Master Gu in the study.

353
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,520
That's perfect then.

354
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,880
Even if Second Brother doesn't have the manpower,

355
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,960
we've got Second Uncle Gu.

356
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,040
Where are you going?

357
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,080
Where are you going?

358
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,510
To report to the precinct!

359
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,720
Let's go have a drink instead!

360
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,560
What precinct? Don't do that.

361
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,680
Big Madam flips truth

362
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,880
and lies and frames me.

363
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,040
Once the Master comes home and gets the details,

364
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,000
you'll be eating great fruits then!

365
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,120
I am the Big Madam and I can't control you

366
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,960
petty concubine?

367
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,160
Send her to Kaifeng Precinct.

368
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:42,480
Anyone who doesn't help

369
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,440
will be banished from Sheng House!

370
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,400
Mother!

371
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,480
Mother!

372
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,800
Banish him from Sheng House!

373
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,920
Old Madam sends Sixth Miss

374
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,840
to deliver instructions

375
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,400
Mother

376
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,080
Disposal?

377
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,720
Stop. Stop, everyone!

378
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,120
Mother!

379
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,520
Mother!

380
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,440
Lin Qinshuang, you listen carefully!

381
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,120
Mother has sent words!

382
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,040
That Old Madam isn't able to walk here,

383
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,600
but she's sure timely with instructions.

384
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,000
A few yard walls over,

385
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,400
and she is so clear on the happenings

386
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,400
of this courtyard?

387
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,600
Spare your nonsense!

388
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,360
Tell me.

389
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,400
Big Madam and Mistress Lin.

390
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,360
Each of you is to be confined to Weirui Balcony

391
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,200
and Linqi Pavilion respectively.

392
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,160
Permission denied for movements in and out unauthorized.

393
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,160
Me?

394
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,160
Big Madam, don't blame me.

395
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,560
I am the messenger,

396
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,360
and these are Grandmother's words.

397
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,080
Whether they are Grandmother's words

398
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:45,960
we don't know yet.

399
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,040
Who knows if it's not your own idea,

400
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,240
putting on a pretense to ruin my mother!

401
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,400
You brought in

402
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,360
an outsider man unauthorized,

403
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,240
and I haven't dealt with you for that!

404
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,880
Don't be scared of him. Continue.

405
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,760
Big Madam is cleaning up the family.

406
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,720
Lin Clanswoman met with an outsider man secretly.

407
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,960
The evidence is confirmed!

408
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,440
But as for adultery,

409
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,600
it is not confirmed.

410
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,560
Are you foolish?

411
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,280
The last part,

412
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,611
you could have just said to me in private.

413
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,262
What did you mention

414
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,440
it before the whore?

415
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,960
What secret meeting?

416
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,320
I was clearly discussing business!

417
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,880
Grandmother guessed Lin clanswoman would say so,

418
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,360
and she told me to ask you a question.

419
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,520
If it's a proper business discussion,

420
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,840
then why did you have to dress in disguise?

421
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,120
Lin clanswoman's punishment is

422
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,400
as follows: twenty strokes of beating.

423
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,400
Big Madam.

424
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,160
I've brought all of Grandmother's words.

425
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,200
I'll return now to serve medicine to her.

426
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,640
Caihuan, walk Sixth Miss out.

427
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,080
Push her down.

428
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,920
You brought an outsider

429
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,040
and barged into the private quarters.

430
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,520
This matter is an offense

431
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,360
no matter who hears it.

432
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,600
How about getting punished along with her then?

433
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,680
You carry out her sentence.

434
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,640
Wang Ruofu! You whore!

435
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,520
You would have the son beat the mother?

436
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,560
Such a defying act of filial piety!

437
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,920
Once the Master returns,

438
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,920
you'll see how he treats you!

439
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,760
"Mother and son"?

440
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,520
Who's his mother?

441
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:37,223
I am his mother (this is officially true, only the main wife is the legal parent of all offspring)

442
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,240
What are you?

443
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,640
You're a Sheng slave!

444
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,800
Hit her.

445
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,560
You'll hit her,

446
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,920
or I will tell in detail the matter of you bringing in

447
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,800
an outsider to the private quarters of the women!

448
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,520
When your father comes back

449
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,840
I will tell him in details

450
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,040
And those warblers

451
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,040
and swallows in your room,

452
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,720
I'll go and tell your

453
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,640
Second Brother about that!

454
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,880
You didn't eat?

455
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,240
Hit her harder.

456
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,000
Wang Ruofu

457
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:26,920
If Lin clanswoman doesn't scream,

458
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,920
it doesn't count.

459
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,320
Mother!

460
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,640
Changfeng.

461
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,720
Wang Ruofu!

462
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,600
Though I didn't get to trample that Lin clanswoman to death,

463
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,520
I got to whip her

464
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,720
a few strokes and that's something.

465
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,320
Vent out my grudge

466
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,240
getting pressed by her all these years.

467
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,200
Mother, you can still laugh?

468
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,760
You had Changfeng beat Lin Clanswoman.

469
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,320
That's too wild!

470
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,160
Though you are his main mother,

471
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,160
he grew up by his birth mother

472
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,520
since he was little.

473
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,200
If this really goes to court,

474
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,760
Mother,

475
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,840
you'll be rebuked.

476
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,920
It was a rare opportunity.

477
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,720
Of course

478
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,760
I want to get rid of that Lin whore.

479
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,800
Then my life

480
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,120
in the yard is easier.

481
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,600
And also,

482
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,640
this was your grandmother's idea.

483
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,160
Yes, it was my grandmother's idea.

484
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,280
She said to watch

485
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,120
the home and the servants.

486
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,160
But she didn't tell you to go wild like this.

487
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,200
If Grandmother

488
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,240
were to handle that Lin woman,

489
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,120
she wouldn't have

490
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,080
let this chaos happen.

491
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,040
Wait and see.

492
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,480
You got that Lin woman good this time.

493
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,840
She won't just take this idly.

494
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,720
Once Father returns,

495
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,200
she's going to make some ruckus.

496
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,800
What ruckus?

497
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,960
The main mother manages the inner quarters.

498
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,880
She's suspicious

499
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,400
and I can't ask about it?

500
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,400
Even if I asked erroneously,

501
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,160
it's not like the Minister can banish me.

502
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,880
He can't,

503
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,720
but your relationship

504
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,290
as husband and wife will dim.

505
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,560
I told you to go and find out

506
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,200
about your father in the palace.

507
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,800
Did you find anything?

508
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,280
Mother.

509
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,000
You finally ask me about the real matter.

510
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,560
I had Wenshao ask around everywhere.

511
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,960
No news at all.

512
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,920
Even my father-in-law,

513
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,760
the old Count isn't clear on it.

514
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,120
For this,

515
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,440
I came here.

516
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,760
But once I got here,

517
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,160
I ran into this.

518
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,040
Then your father's in trouble.

519
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,120
And Yuan House hasn't treated you badly, right?

520
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,520
Father-in-law said nothing

521
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,840
It's nothing.

522
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,840
Don't worry, Mother.

523
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,120
How can I not worry?

524
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,320
Your mother-in-law

525
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,000
is so biased for the eldest son.

526
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,160
At the time

527
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,400
that elder Yuan boy almost

528
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,560
took away your betrothal goose

529
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,320
and your mother-in-law didn't even scold him!

530
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,760
Your maiden home is in this crisis

531
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,840
and she would let it go on you?

532
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,160
At worst,

533
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,002
I can just pull out some money

534
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,600
Buy some serenity.

535
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,080
It's nothing.

536
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,040
How unlucky am I?

537
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,600
My husband, no news of him, good or bad.

538
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,040
The daughter is bullied at the mother-in-law's home.

539
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,320
How can I live on?

540
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,200
How do I live?

541
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,280
Mother.

542
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,040
Thanks to you two interior officials.

543
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,480
Master. You. Master!

544
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,055
I beg you, Buddha and Bodhisattvas,

545
00:22:55,055 --> 00:22:56,200
all your divine spirits

546
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,480
Preserve our house's Minister

547
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,320
to come home safely.

548
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,000
The Master is back!

549
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,810
Big Madam. Master is back!

550
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,520
Where is he? Where?

551
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,000
Master said he would go over to Shouan Hall

552
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,840
to greet Old Madam first.

553
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,840
He sent Dongrong

554
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,000
to come tell you,

555
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,040
so you're not worried sick.

556
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,080
Hurry. Let's go to Shouan Hall now.

557
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,920
Minister!

558
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,120
Minister!

559
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,000
Minister!

560
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,080
Minister!

561
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,120
I'm not dreaming, right?

562
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,880
Your court robe is on

563
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,600
and your limbs are attached.

564
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,440
Divine Spirit of Bodhisattvas' providence.

565
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,720
Sheng ancestors' spirits protected you!

566
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,960
Minister.

567
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,760
Alright.

568
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,280
Go and pay

569
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,520
respects to Mother.

570
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,320
Don't cling to me like this.

571
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,800
Greetings, Mother.

572
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,960
Greetings, Grandmother.

573
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,240
Alright. Just as long as you're back.

574
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,240
You didn't return for two days and one night.

575
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,240
You are fatigued.

576
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,600
Go bath and change and rest

577
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,200
a bit before we talk here.

578
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,440
Then, I'll go and come back.

579
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,600
No rush.

580
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,760
You can catch up

581
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,840
with your wife and daughters.

582
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,600
You can come visit at dinner time

583
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,840
that's just as well.

584
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,640
Hurry.

585
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,080
Grandmother,

586
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,334
why didn't you ask Father

587
00:25:05,334 --> 00:25:05,840
why he was detained at the palace?

588
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,350
If it were a blissful event,

589
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,760
he would have said so already.

590
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,640
Look at how he came in

591
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,720
with a weary face,

592
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,920
stressed from the court from head to toe.

593
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,880
Most likely he was reprimanded by His Majesty.

594
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,400
So why ask?

595
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,560
As long as it has no effect

596
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,480
to Sheng clan's flourishing,

597
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,920
if he is willing to tell us, then tell us.

598
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,825
If he's not willing to talk about it,

599
00:25:30,825 --> 00:25:31,680
then let him be.

600
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,320
Good, good.

601
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:55,920
Father.

602
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,480
Hurry and go.

603
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:00,880
Go and have them boil some hot water on the stove

604
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,906
Go and have them

605
00:26:01,906 --> 00:26:02,960
boil some hot water on the stove

606
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,760
to fill your father's bath.

607
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,520
Go.

608
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,600
Alright.

609
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,240
I'll go take a look at the house kitchen soon.

610
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,960
I'll cook a few dishes you like.

611
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,520
Do you want wine?

612
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,720
I've got a few crocks of good wine.

613
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,240
Alright. Anything is fine.

614
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,400
Mother. Then I'll go help in the kitchen too.

615
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,160
You stay here.

616
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,600
Let this father take a good look at you.

617
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,360
Alright.

618
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,480
You haven't returned for half a year,

619
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,400
and I think

620
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,880
you are thinner.

621
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,800
My little business

622
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,720
isn't worthy to be mentioned.

623
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,160
But Father,

624
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,680
why didn't you come back for two days?

625
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,040
The whole house was flipped upside down in chaos.

626
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,480
Mother was so worried

627
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,440
and her eyes are red.

628
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,640
For my business,

629
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,320
I've encumbered you

630
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,240
to make the trip here.

631
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,480
I've not doted on you in vain.

632
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,840
Reporting to Master and Madam.

633
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,080
Yuan House

634
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,680
sent someone to escort

635
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,080
Eldest Miss back.

636
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,720
They claim the Count Manor is asking

637
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,600
how long she's staying.

638
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,040
That all sorts of business are waiting at home

639
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,880
to be managed

640
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,920
by the Eldest Miss.

641
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,600
My mother-in-law is watching me too strictly.

642
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,120
But it's fine since I got to see Father return safely

643
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,320
and I can be at ease now.

644
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,520
Father. Mother.

645
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,880
Then your daughter takes her leave.

646
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,720
Our daughter is their Yuan House's daughter-in-law,

647
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,720
and not their nanny

648
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,080
for all sorts of work.

649
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,840
Mother!

650
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,920
Hua'er.

651
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,280
Old Madam is looking into a way now.

652
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,800
You grew up by her,

653
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,160
and she won't just sit

654
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,000
and watch you suffer.

655
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,080
Yes, yes.

656
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,880
Old Madam has a plan.

657
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,360
You bear it for now

658
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,240
and if it gets too hard,

659
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,600
just come back and live here for a few days.

660
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,840
Don't just hold it in and only tell us

661
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,680
about the good news and leaving out the worries.

662
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,280
I understand, Mother.

663
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,560
Don't worry about me.

664
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,520
Be at ease.

665
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:18,880
Father.

666
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,720
I, Hua'er, take my leave.

667
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,360
What are you doing here?

668
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,280
Didn't she tell you to be confined?

669
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,600
Feng's memory is so bad?

670
00:28:58,973 --> 00:28:59,440
I scolded him about not bringing an outsider

671
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,320
into the inner quarters yesterday,

672
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,840
and he's already forgotten it today?

673
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,798
We heard the Master is back

674
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,760
and this concubine is worried.

675
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,040
Feng whined and begged that I bring him,

676
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,840
since he misses his father.

677
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,080
Just one look of his father,

678
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,080
and it will put him at ease.

679
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,360
There's no place for you to stand here.

680
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,080
Go back!

681
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,000
Hong! Hong!

682
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,680
Hong, you're finally back, Hong!

683
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,320
Hong! Hong!

684
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,000
Father!

685
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,800
Hold.

686
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,600
Father.

687
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,760
I finally can see you.

688
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,840
Feng'er.

689
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,760
I heard just now

690
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,400
your mother saying you miss me.

691
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,480
Yes, yes.

692
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,360
Feng'er didn't get to

693
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,520
rest well at all lately.

694
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,200
His eyes are steeped in red.

695
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,200
Greetings, Father.

696
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,360
I have been worried about you.

697
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,800
Father,

698
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,600
did you suffer in the palace?

699
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,040
Suffer?

700
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,040
His Majesty kept me in the palace.

701
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,760
Living in a grand mansion hall

702
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,960
and dining on bejeweled cups of nectar.

703
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,750
Holding such blissful conversations

704
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:14,760
that I didn't come home.

705
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,880
Congratulations, Father. Felicitations!

706
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,640
You dumb bastard!

707
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,810
You can't tell that was sarcasm?

708
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,200
Hong, why?

709
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,360
Why?

710
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,880
Because of the nonsense he spewed out!

711
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,640
I almost lost my life!

712
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,920
Today,

713
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,800
I must beat you scum to death!

714
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,480
Hong. Hong!

715
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,200
Father.

716
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,320
What happened, Hong

717
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,600
Flesh and blood

718
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,440
Hong

719
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,600
"Flesh and blood"?

720
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,520
I don't have that as a son!

721
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,800
Now you care

722
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,080
I'm his father?

723
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,680
Do you know

724
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,040
why the Emperor detained me in the palace?

725
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,920
You ask him.

726
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,800
Do you know?

727
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,280
Loafing around all day,

728
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,240
and acquainted a bunch of rogues!

729
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,160
Drinking and womanizing. Freely indulging!

730
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,200
To speak nonsense with Prince Yan's men

731
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,040
about succeeding the throne!

732
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,040
His drunken words were heard by others!

733
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,000
They were sent to the Emperor's ears!

734
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:14,360
Hong. Hong!

735
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,200
You..!

736
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,280
Then that's a sky-collapsing calamity!

737
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,400
Sky-collapsing calamity!

738
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,040
Cry!

739
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,440
His Majesty knows many ministers

740
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,080
are involved in

741
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,640
battle over the throne.

742
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,280
In order to make an example

743
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,240
to sternly warn everyone,

744
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,760
he detained me,

745
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,480
a fifth-ranking minor official.

746
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,880
He coldly refused to meet me the whole day.

747
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,400
In a side hall with no one else,

748
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,920
I was detained for a day and night!

749
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,280
When will His Majesty

750
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,040
summon me?

751
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,360
to have you wait here

752
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,120
without leaving.

753
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,960
I'd like to change.

754
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,760
That taste.

755
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,480
That taste is like

756
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,960
having a sharp dagger on your neck.

757
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,040
Brink of life and death.

758
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,720
Each second is a torture.

759
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,640
Your Majesty.

760
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,520
Your Majesty,

761
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,680
forgive me for my untidy robe.

762
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,360
Minister, did you sleep well last night?

763
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,375
Replying to Your Majesty,

764
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,640
I was ill at ease and kept turning，

765
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,440
without a sound sleep.

766
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,920
Good.

767
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,760
So you know what it tastes like

768
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,680
to be difficult to slumber.

769
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,720
Your minister is startled.

770
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,440
May Your Majesty clarify.

771
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,200
The nation has no heir to the throne.

772
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,960
It's akin to having no pillar.

773
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:32,240
I am put to extreme anxiety

774
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,320
and unable to sleep nightly.

775
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,440
Your young son, however,

776
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,440
went to a wine hall,

777
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:41,360
and discussed openly

778
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,280
about the Imperial family's succession.

779
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,550
I imagine you've already

780
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,320
made your conclusion on the matter.

781
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,880
Then go ahead and tell me too,

782
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,880
so I can sleep soundly too.

783
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,080
Your Majesty,

784
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,040
I, I really don't know.

785
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,000
I heard that after the spring exam

786
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,520
roster was posted,

787
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,120
Sheng House's third son, Changfeng,

788
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,120
and Venerable Qiu's son, Qiu Keli,

789
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,400
enjoyed music into the night.

790
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,500
At the banquet,

791
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,120
they discussed how capable Prince Yan is.

792
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,840
How he's a noble by birth

793
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,400
and he'd be the next Emperor soon.

794
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,720
I imagine you've made that conclusion at home

795
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:26,080
and it's permeated into your son?

796
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,160
No, I wouldn't dare.

797
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,160
It's my humble son who's ignorant.

798
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,160
My foolish son is young

799
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,000
and ignorant of court affairs.

800
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,480
He's spewed nonsense.

801
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,680
He's entered the Imperial exam and come out.

802
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,880
So how is it that he's ignorant of the court?

803
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,575
A great man must be loyal to the ruler

804
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:45,640
and love the nation.

805
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,880
It might be better to be a simple subject

806
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,240
and spared from the meaningless fight.

807
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,080
Your Majesty, at home, I often

808
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,000
teach my children

809
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,560
that the Emperor is sage and gracious.

810
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,680
That no matter what he decides on,

811
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,000
it's all

812
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
for the sake of the nation.

813
00:36:02,104 --> 00:36:04,080
I also often teach my children,

814
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,575
that a great man must be loyal

815
00:36:05,575 --> 00:36:06,920
to the ruler and love the nation,

816
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,160
instead of engaging in meaningless fights.

817
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,600
To be a simple subject is the right course.

818
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,720
So you are a sensible man.

819
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,160
But you've failed in teaching your son.

820
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,560
These words of yours,

821
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,080
your son

822
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,240
didn't listen to even one.

823
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,880
My son drank and spoke without virtue

824
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,840
in the wrong company

825
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,600
I shall reprimand him severely,

826
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,520
so he knows

827
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,880
never to speak nonsense again!

828
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,000
You went and spoke nonsense wildly!

829
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,560
Currying favor

830
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,400
with the rich!

831
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,280
Talking out of bounds!

832
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,680
Currying favor with the rich!

833
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,880
Bastard!

834
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,760
Speaking nonsense!

835
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,440
That book of yours.

836
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,800
You read it to your dog's stomach instead!

837
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,440
Those present,

838
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,640
do you know

839
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,000
which were linked to Qiu House?

840
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,520
How do you know

841
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,560
which was the Emperor's spy?

842
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,320
How?

843
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,880
Drag him out and continue the beating.

844
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,920
NO！NO!

845
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,200
Father, I'll never again

846
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,720
Father, I'll never again

847
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,480
You can't hit him any more

848
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,760
Father

849
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,280
or he'll die, Father.

850
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:42,920
Mother

851
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,720
Beat him to death!

852
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,080
Hong!

853
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,320
Even if he's beaten to death today,

854
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,640
it's better than the whole family dying.

855
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,120
Hong, someone must have

856
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,640
been jealous that

857
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,840
Feng'er was acquainted with the elite,

858
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,120
and they went to make a scene

859
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,640
to His Majesty to fool him!

860
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,600
His Majesty spoke in detail

861
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,800
as to what happened.

862
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,160
You say he was tricked?

863
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,240
In what way was he tricked?

864
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,400
Official houses like ours

865
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,680
have strict rules.

866
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,720
Rulan just merely

867
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,160
walked a few steps too many into the hall

868
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,350
and she was punished to kneel

869
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,320
at the shrine overnight

870
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,880
Changfeng caused this wreck

871
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,320
and a few beatings are considered light .

872
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,120
A thing like you that came into my house

873
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,400
with a pregnant belly.

874
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,000
You don't care about your own shame.

875
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,800
But you want to ruin the Master's honor too?

876
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,040
I think he was badly

877
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,960
raised in your room.

878
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,320
A good kid and

879
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,560
taught badly by you.

880
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,200
Big Madam.

881
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,840
I know you loathe me.

882
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,400
Changfeng barged in

883
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,840
and you couldn't force me to die!

884
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,280
Hate me all you want

885
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,000
and beat me,

886
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,040
but why do you have to force him to death too?

887
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,120
Land and shops worth over a thousand silver

888
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,120
and you don't even ask first!

889
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,120
You just take it out to meet a man in secret.

890
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,520
You claim you weren't trying

891
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,320
to gather money to elope?

892
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,520
Speak with some conscience.

893
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,560
In broad daylight,

894
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,760
I simply only met a man

895
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,080
to sign a contract at Fan House.

896
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,760
Then you claim,

897
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,480
I . . .you say I..

898
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,760
Madam, your ladyship.

899
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,240
I have already sworn

900
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,080
that I wouldn't tell Hong about how you

901
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,675
took from the general account

902
00:39:24,675 --> 00:39:25,210
to pay the high-interest accounts,

903
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,800
to supplement

904
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,080
your maiden home!

905
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,480
But why do you insist on forcing me?

906
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,440
What?

907
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,080
When did you

908
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:35,920
ever say that?

909
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,040
What high-interest account?

910
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,480
Nothing much.

911
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,120
Alright. This is so great.

912
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,280
Mo'er,

913
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,200
do you see how great our family is?

914
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,120
Your main mother's got issues

915
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,160
and your own mother's got issues.

916
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,240
Great.

917
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,960
Let's all take turns and talk.

918
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,440
Let me be the official court

919
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,200
and sentence you.

920
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,640
Sentence your shit crap of a case!

921
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:11,440
I also heard,

922
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,080
your main wife

923
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,560
bought a paddy field outside the capital,

924
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,560
and she was almost sued.

925
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,560
It was thanks to Madam Wang's assistance

926
00:40:22,225 --> 00:40:22,760
that it was settled.

927
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,240
If it weren't for today,

928
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,480
had she not framed me

929
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,200
for being adulterous,

930
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:33,280
I I

931
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,720
This matter.

932
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,080
Why didn't you say it before?

933
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,440
Father.

934
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,040
Big Madam is the master of the inner quarters.

935
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,000
My mother doesn't dare to just say things.

936
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,680
If it hadn't been

937
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,560
how she was framed so direly today,

938
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,200
and she almost died, that she . . .

939
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,360
That she finally had to.

940
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,040
You talk. Did it happen?

941
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,160
May Master's anger dissipate. Our Big Madam.

942
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,280
If you intend to keep it from me,

943
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,800
I can still find out

944
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,400
from others.

945
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,200
I lent money to my sister

946
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:20,960
to invest in high interest loans.

947
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,720
It's actually to

948
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,520
make money to supplement our expense.

949
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,360
I didn't get any loss.

950
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,440
I earned interest money

951
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,480
and gave some to my sister.

952
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,440
It's not really considered supplementing my maiden home.

953
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,080
Great.

954
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,600
That's really great.

955
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,120
We are

956
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,080
so poor now?

957
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,160
Is that right?

958
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,375
In this capital of Bianjing,

959
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,240
under the emperor's feet, by the Imperial fortress.

960
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,360
You're married to an official

961
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,040
and you dare to run private loans?

962
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,760
I...

963
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,480
You dare to do lawsuits to confiscate land?

964
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,360
I got it now.

965
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,560
You want to see me sued,

966
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,480
branded

967
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,720
and exiled.

968
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,480
I...

969
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:23,360
That'll make you happy then?

970
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,720
Hong.

971
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,680
Don't blame her.

972
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,720
You too.

973
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,560
So poor that you can't live.

974
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,280
You have no other ways,

975
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,360
so you pawn off family assets, right?

976
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,200
No, no.

977
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,200
No, no. I already settled the business

978
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,360
a few months ago.

979
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,000
Minister, you devastate me!

980
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,440
It was all for this family's sake.

981
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,440
Minister.

982
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,080
Father.

983
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,280
Don't accuse my mother wrongly.

984
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,000
Minister!

985
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,080
Father.

986
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,280
You must not be manipulated,

987
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,440
Master.

988
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,440
Our Big Madam

989
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,400
meant well.

990
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,640
Don't begrudge my mother wrongly.

991
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,680
Minister!

992
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,120
You all shut up!

993
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:30,080
Heavens

994
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,600
When I held my head

995
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,120
in the palace,

996
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,400
you were in this courtyard,

997
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,600
dog biting dog.

998
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,160
If I had truly fallen,

999
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,000
and on my road to exile

1000
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,400
would any of you follow me?

1001
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:05,880
Get lost.

1002
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,320
You all get lost!
