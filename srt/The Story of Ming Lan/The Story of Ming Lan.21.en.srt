00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,908
Episode 21

3
00:03:49,586 --> 00:03:51,443
Why don't you just stay in the capital and wait?

4
00:03:52,043 --> 00:03:52,992
There are "missing person" notices

5
00:03:52,992 --> 00:03:53,483
posted everywhere.

6
00:03:53,803 --> 00:03:54,803
If anyone finds them

7
00:03:54,803 --> 00:03:55,883
you'll be informed,

8
00:03:56,003 --> 00:03:57,083
wouldn't that be better?

9
00:03:59,003 --> 00:03:59,923
No use.

10
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:01,963
I've searched inside and outside

11
00:04:02,003 --> 00:04:03,043
the capital several times.

12
00:04:03,523 --> 00:04:05,043
This woman is very cunning.

13
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:06,532
Posting missing person notices

14
00:04:06,532 --> 00:04:07,283
hasn't been sufficient to capture her.

15
00:04:08,483 --> 00:04:09,723
She probably has changed her appearance.

16
00:04:11,323 --> 00:04:12,203
I'll personally look for her.

17
00:04:12,733 --> 00:04:14,003
Maybe I'll be able to recognize her better.

18
00:04:16,443 --> 00:04:17,843
Chang'er is a good child.

19
00:04:19,123 --> 00:04:20,683
I don't want him to be dragged down

20
00:04:20,683 --> 00:04:21,523
by family matters

21
00:04:22,163 --> 00:04:23,563
and living days of having no father.

22
00:04:25,243 --> 00:04:26,843
Even to the ends of the earth,

23
00:04:26,843 --> 00:04:27,883
I'll find him.

24
00:04:33,483 --> 00:04:34,883
But with a vast sea of people

25
00:04:34,883 --> 00:04:35,963
where will you look for them?

26
00:04:38,003 --> 00:04:39,363
Shitou was originally from the Canal Gang.

27
00:04:40,123 --> 00:04:40,963
His brother-in-law is now

28
00:04:40,963 --> 00:04:42,163
a leader in the Canal Gang.

29
00:04:43,203 --> 00:04:44,563
They might have faster and more abundant news

30
00:04:44,563 --> 00:04:45,923
than the government.

31
00:04:47,043 --> 00:04:49,523
Moreover, my reputation in the capital

32
00:04:49,563 --> 00:04:50,683
is already so bad.

33
00:04:51,283 --> 00:04:51,883
Going out to see another land

34
00:04:51,883 --> 00:04:53,043
is good too.

35
00:04:55,603 --> 00:04:56,603
In two months,

36
00:04:57,483 --> 00:04:58,403
I'm going to get married.

37
00:04:59,443 --> 00:05:00,620
Why don't you attend my wedding first

38
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,083
before leaving?

39
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:03,683
I won't attend.

40
00:05:04,723 --> 00:05:05,443
I won't attend

41
00:05:05,443 --> 00:05:06,403
your wedding anymore.

42
00:05:07,483 --> 00:05:08,003
I might just

43
00:05:08,003 --> 00:05:09,603
transfer my misfortunes to you.

44
00:05:10,403 --> 00:05:12,523
When that day comes, what if I affect your wedding?

45
00:05:12,523 --> 00:05:14,083
I-It would be a great sin.

46
00:05:14,696 --> 00:05:15,123
You know that

47
00:05:15,163 --> 00:05:16,323
I never have such thoughts!

48
00:05:16,723 --> 00:05:17,563
Changbai,

49
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:21,323
you're closer to me than my real brothers.

50
00:05:22,963 --> 00:05:24,443
I don't want to take risks with your matter.

51
00:05:27,003 --> 00:05:28,963
Okay. Let's stop talking about that.

52
00:05:31,203 --> 00:05:33,483
The road ahead of you is tough. Always be careful.

53
00:05:34,363 --> 00:05:35,243
Come back soon.

54
00:06:04,803 --> 00:06:06,563
Looks like I won't be able to

55
00:06:06,563 --> 00:06:07,843
celebrate my birthday today.

56
00:06:08,843 --> 00:06:09,393
With such a huge event

57
00:06:09,393 --> 00:06:10,163
happening in the House of Gu,

58
00:06:11,283 --> 00:06:13,243
they are related with our ancestors after all.

59
00:06:13,816 --> 00:06:16,043
It's better to not make any disturbance.

60
00:06:17,163 --> 00:06:17,963
That's right.

61
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:20,763
It's a good thing that

62
00:06:20,763 --> 00:06:21,763
it's not a major birthday.

63
00:06:22,803 --> 00:06:23,803
Once it's your next major birthday,

64
00:06:24,563 --> 00:06:25,643
I surely will

65
00:06:25,643 --> 00:06:26,483
organize a grand celebration.

66
00:06:27,643 --> 00:06:29,883
We'll light fireworks and hang colorful lamps.

67
00:06:48,563 --> 00:06:49,975
I keep feeling that this painting

68
00:06:49,975 --> 00:06:51,363
doesn't look like Mother.

69
00:06:54,763 --> 00:06:55,803
Come over and look.

70
00:06:55,803 --> 00:06:57,003
Can you identify it as Mother?

71
00:06:59,603 --> 00:07:00,523
Look at that lotus-flower crown.

72
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:01,803
Other than Her Highness,

73
00:07:01,803 --> 00:07:02,923
who else has such a lotus-flower crown?

74
00:07:05,563 --> 00:07:06,443
Okay then.

75
00:07:06,683 --> 00:07:07,643
Quickly

76
00:07:07,643 --> 00:07:08,403
deliver this painting then.

77
00:07:18,053 --> 00:07:19,043
What's going on?

78
00:07:20,196 --> 00:07:21,923
Isn't it time for dinner?

79
00:07:23,003 --> 00:07:24,101
The kitchen indeed said that

80
00:07:24,101 --> 00:07:25,003
you can have your meal.

81
00:07:25,523 --> 00:07:27,163
I'll tell the servant to rush it.

82
00:07:28,043 --> 00:07:28,803
No need!

83
00:07:33,323 --> 00:07:35,043
Father, Mother.

84
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:39,523
Buwei, tell them that we're all here.

85
00:07:39,946 --> 00:07:41,443
Tell Chef Shen to move his wok and serve the dishes!

86
00:07:41,963 --> 00:07:42,443
Yes.

87
00:07:46,576 --> 00:07:49,123
Mother, today is your birthday.

88
00:07:49,443 --> 00:07:50,203
Please sit down.

89
00:07:53,243 --> 00:07:53,843
Father.

90
00:07:57,763 --> 00:07:59,323
What mischief

91
00:07:59,323 --> 00:08:00,363
have you set up for us now?

92
00:08:01,556 --> 00:08:04,363
I realized that Mother's birthday this year

93
00:08:04,363 --> 00:08:05,083
can't be celebrated in a grand manner,

94
00:08:05,683 --> 00:08:06,683
but it also can't be allowed

95
00:08:06,683 --> 00:08:07,363
to pass just like that.

96
00:08:08,043 --> 00:08:09,107
I especially went to Fan House

97
00:08:09,107 --> 00:08:10,043
and invited their main chef

98
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,243
to cook a set of dishes for Mother.

99
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:13,163
Let's eat some new dishes.

100
00:08:15,003 --> 00:08:16,643
It's enough that you're this filial.

101
00:08:17,283 --> 00:08:19,683
No need to invite the chef from Fan House.

102
00:08:20,146 --> 00:08:21,723
Our Cook Song

103
00:08:21,723 --> 00:08:23,243
can also make a good soup.

104
00:08:23,563 --> 00:08:24,483
Indeed.

105
00:08:24,723 --> 00:08:26,123
Mother, you don't know.

106
00:08:26,603 --> 00:08:27,603
The person I hired

107
00:08:27,603 --> 00:08:28,963
is Head Chef Shen.

108
00:08:29,803 --> 00:08:30,251
Their restaurant today

109
00:08:30,251 --> 00:08:30,803
tried out a new cooking style.

110
00:08:30,803 --> 00:08:32,243
Their restaurant today tried out a new cooking style.

111
00:08:32,563 --> 00:08:34,563
It's not boiling nor frying.

112
00:08:35,546 --> 00:08:36,643
It's in between the two,

113
00:08:37,043 --> 00:08:38,403
and they called it

114
00:08:38,403 --> 00:08:39,323
"stir-fry".

115
00:08:39,646 --> 00:08:41,043
It's best to eat them

116
00:08:41,043 --> 00:08:41,843
right after cooking.

117
00:08:58,603 --> 00:08:59,483
How does it taste?

118
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,283
I've also heard about it,

119
00:09:05,283 --> 00:09:06,483
but I've never tasted it.

120
00:09:08,003 --> 00:09:09,003
It's really fresh.

121
00:09:10,003 --> 00:09:11,883
You really are full of ideas.

122
00:09:12,243 --> 00:09:13,803
Thanks to you, I enjoyed this fortune.

123
00:09:14,803 --> 00:09:16,243
I still have a lot of ideas.

124
00:09:16,483 --> 00:09:18,523
As they say, "burning incense and drinking tea

125
00:09:18,523 --> 00:09:19,403
hanging paintings and arranging flowers".

126
00:09:19,803 --> 00:09:21,843
These four idle crafts won't tire you easily.

127
00:09:22,403 --> 00:09:23,883
I personally

128
00:09:23,883 --> 00:09:24,923
made a painting.

129
00:09:25,243 --> 00:09:26,483
If you want to praise me,

130
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:27,363
think of the words now.

131
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:28,403
Later,

132
00:09:28,403 --> 00:09:30,243
slowly praise me with them.

133
00:09:33,403 --> 00:09:33,963
Buwei!

134
00:09:35,003 --> 00:09:35,843
Hang the lanterns!

135
00:09:58,843 --> 00:09:59,923
Wife, look.

136
00:10:11,106 --> 00:10:12,603
Wife, this is you.

137
00:10:30,781 --> 00:10:33,992
Today I feel like

138
00:10:33,992 --> 00:10:35,523
raising you was not in vain.

139
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:56,203
In the past,

140
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:58,483
I always regarded you as a child.

141
00:10:59,163 --> 00:11:01,443
Today, seeing how you already know

142
00:11:01,443 --> 00:11:02,203
to dote on your father and I,

143
00:11:02,603 --> 00:11:04,323
you have now grown up.

144
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,883
You must study well.

145
00:11:07,323 --> 00:11:08,563
Get into the rankings.

146
00:11:08,563 --> 00:11:10,843
Let everyone in the capital see

147
00:11:11,256 --> 00:11:12,643
that the child of our ducal house

148
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,963
is a real conqueror

149
00:11:14,963 --> 00:11:16,163
of the civil examination.

150
00:11:16,723 --> 00:11:17,643
I get it, Mother.

151
00:11:17,703 --> 00:11:19,923
Yes. After passing the civil examination

152
00:11:20,453 --> 00:11:22,483
and then getting married,

153
00:11:22,986 --> 00:11:25,083
we then can enjoy our blessings at ease.

154
00:11:28,443 --> 00:11:29,963
People will tell one to marry and start a career,

155
00:11:31,003 --> 00:11:33,043
but would also say that to govern the country,

156
00:11:33,043 --> 00:11:33,685
one must first learn to govern yourself,

157
00:11:33,685 --> 00:11:34,083
then govern your family.

158
00:11:34,466 --> 00:11:36,563
Based on that, one should first have a family

159
00:11:37,323 --> 00:11:39,123
before joining the Imperial court.

160
00:11:41,723 --> 00:11:43,843
What do you mean?

161
00:11:46,003 --> 00:11:47,003
I

162
00:11:50,926 --> 00:11:52,163
I have someone I like.

163
00:11:52,523 --> 00:11:54,963
I want to ask Father and Mother

164
00:11:54,963 --> 00:11:55,883
to seek her hand in marriage.

165
00:11:58,963 --> 00:12:00,963
You how could you have someone?

166
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:03,323
What do you mean, someone?

167
00:12:05,443 --> 00:12:07,243
Did you

168
00:12:07,243 --> 00:12:09,203
do something wrong?

169
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,963
No! Of course not!

170
00:12:12,243 --> 00:12:13,643
I respect and love her.

171
00:12:13,943 --> 00:12:14,763
I haven't

172
00:12:14,763 --> 00:12:15,523
even touched her hair!

173
00:12:16,043 --> 00:12:17,283
Since it's to propose marriage,

174
00:12:18,203 --> 00:12:19,723
then she surely isn't from our house.

175
00:12:20,843 --> 00:12:22,203
But every day,

176
00:12:22,203 --> 00:12:24,123
you're either just in school or at home.

177
00:12:24,836 --> 00:12:26,043
Who could you have liked?

178
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:29,163
Mother, don't worry.

179
00:12:29,283 --> 00:12:30,403
She surely is a good lady.

180
00:12:30,403 --> 00:12:31,563
A woman from a house of scholars.

181
00:12:31,883 --> 00:12:32,874
Although her family's status

182
00:12:32,874 --> 00:12:33,683
is a bit far from ours,

183
00:12:34,283 --> 00:12:36,123
they are still officials for generations.

184
00:12:36,603 --> 00:12:37,243
Mother,

185
00:12:38,403 --> 00:12:39,723
just agree with my request first.

186
00:12:43,843 --> 00:12:46,523
You like the Sixth Miss of the House of Sheng.

187
00:12:47,603 --> 00:12:48,963
Just for her,

188
00:12:49,923 --> 00:12:53,323
you fought against that prodigal son

189
00:12:53,323 --> 00:12:54,563
of the House of Gu during a jiju game.

190
00:12:54,883 --> 00:12:56,283
This news has spread all over the capital.

191
00:12:58,263 --> 00:13:00,563
I initially thought that since you were

192
00:13:00,563 --> 00:13:01,963
focused on studying before,

193
00:13:02,443 --> 00:13:04,317
having a moment of being competitive

194
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:05,603
and showing off for a man

195
00:13:05,603 --> 00:13:07,043
is just normal.

196
00:13:07,043 --> 00:13:08,563
I didn't say anything.

197
00:13:08,763 --> 00:13:10,443
You pretended to be well-behaved for two days,

198
00:13:11,243 --> 00:13:13,763
even cooked and hung lanterns.

199
00:13:14,123 --> 00:13:17,363
So you're not really being filial.

200
00:13:18,323 --> 00:13:20,243
I even cried a few tears.

201
00:13:21,763 --> 00:13:23,603
You really did fool me!

202
00:13:26,923 --> 00:13:28,243
In providing Mother a birthday feast,

203
00:13:28,243 --> 00:13:29,163
I was most sincere!

204
00:13:30,003 --> 00:13:32,043
Mother, I'm just begging you

205
00:13:32,043 --> 00:13:33,323
to propose marriage.

206
00:13:34,763 --> 00:13:35,956
If I'm able to marry her,

207
00:13:36,643 --> 00:13:37,763
I surely will enter the ranks

208
00:13:37,763 --> 00:13:38,923
in the next civil examination.

209
00:13:39,703 --> 00:13:40,843
You're willing to marry

210
00:13:41,713 --> 00:13:43,283
an illegitimate daughter of

211
00:13:43,283 --> 00:13:44,643
a fifth-rank official as your main wife.

212
00:13:45,243 --> 00:13:46,163
But your father and I

213
00:13:46,723 --> 00:13:48,443
still can't afford to lose our face.

214
00:13:50,036 --> 00:13:52,683
Mother, since I was little,

215
00:13:53,386 --> 00:13:55,123
I would do everything

216
00:13:55,123 --> 00:13:55,883
that you asked.

217
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:57,003
This time,

218
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,163
I beg you to follow what I want.

219
00:13:59,563 --> 00:14:00,763
In the next spring exam

220
00:14:00,763 --> 00:14:01,923
I surely will enter the top ranks.

221
00:14:02,203 --> 00:14:03,523
I'll strive to obtain a splendid honor

222
00:14:04,203 --> 00:14:05,363
for Mother and the House of Duke Qi of the State.

223
00:14:11,003 --> 00:14:11,883
When you were little,

224
00:14:12,763 --> 00:14:14,483
you never made us worry.

225
00:14:15,123 --> 00:14:16,212
Comparing it to that rebellious son

226
00:14:16,212 --> 00:14:17,083
of the adjacent House of Gu,

227
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:19,283
we were already contented.

228
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,923
But now, the house statuses are not compatible.

229
00:14:26,163 --> 00:14:27,083
How about this?

230
00:14:27,843 --> 00:14:28,883
Since you really like her,

231
00:14:30,123 --> 00:14:33,043
let's take her in and make her

232
00:14:33,043 --> 00:14:33,883
a high-ranking concubine.

233
00:14:35,203 --> 00:14:37,043
No. Absolutely not!

234
00:14:40,283 --> 00:14:42,003
Your father has already

235
00:14:42,003 --> 00:14:43,883
smilingly yielded a huge step.

236
00:14:44,323 --> 00:14:45,883
You still dare to refuse him?

237
00:14:46,283 --> 00:14:47,723
Mother, she

238
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,563
How could she

239
00:14:49,563 --> 00:14:49,843
be a concubine?

240
00:14:49,843 --> 00:14:50,777
The concubine of the legitimate son

241
00:14:50,777 --> 00:14:51,403
of Duke Qi of the State.

242
00:14:52,243 --> 00:14:53,603
Does that Miss Sheng of yours

243
00:14:54,043 --> 00:14:54,883
have eyes

244
00:14:54,883 --> 00:14:56,003
in her forehead,

245
00:14:56,403 --> 00:14:57,683
that she still look down on it?

246
00:14:58,243 --> 00:14:59,203
Mother,

247
00:14:59,723 --> 00:15:01,051
their Sheng family is also made up of

248
00:15:01,051 --> 00:15:01,963
officials for generations.

249
00:15:02,396 --> 00:15:03,483
Her grandfather was a Tanhualang.

250
00:15:03,883 --> 00:15:04,913
His father is like a clean stream

251
00:15:04,913 --> 00:15:05,603
in the Imperial court.

252
00:15:05,603 --> 00:15:07,363
He has a lofty reputation.

253
00:15:07,883 --> 00:15:09,323
Don't even talk about their eldest legitimate son.

254
00:15:09,323 --> 00:15:10,123
He ranked in the civil exam on first try.

255
00:15:10,563 --> 00:15:11,763
Even though she's an illegitimate daughter,

256
00:15:12,106 --> 00:15:12,763
she was raised

257
00:15:12,803 --> 00:15:13,763
by her grandmother.

258
00:15:14,363 --> 00:15:15,902
Her grandmother is the only daughter

259
00:15:15,902 --> 00:15:16,803
of Marquis of Yongyi.

260
00:15:17,796 --> 00:15:19,003
Our families can be said to be compatible.

261
00:15:20,123 --> 00:15:22,363
Mother, I beg you.

262
00:15:23,643 --> 00:15:24,643
I only want her.

263
00:15:25,803 --> 00:15:27,883
Yuanruo, are you silly?

264
00:15:29,323 --> 00:15:30,283
Father,

265
00:15:30,283 --> 00:15:31,443
help me convince Mother.

266
00:15:32,523 --> 00:15:34,283
If I'm able to marry her,

267
00:15:34,283 --> 00:15:35,403
I won't take in another one.

268
00:15:35,843 --> 00:15:37,123
I surely will be diligent in studying,

269
00:15:37,123 --> 00:15:37,833
only focusing on my career

270
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:38,723
and bringing honor to our house.

271
00:15:42,403 --> 00:15:43,643
A few days ago,

272
00:15:44,003 --> 00:15:45,603
I received an invitation.

273
00:15:46,396 --> 00:15:47,702
It's about the marriage

274
00:15:47,702 --> 00:15:49,563
between the eldest son of the House

275
00:15:49,563 --> 00:15:51,003
of Sheng with the Hai Family.

276
00:15:51,643 --> 00:15:53,803
Yes. It's the Hai Family.

277
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,843
The House of Hai had five Hanlin Scholars.

278
00:15:56,443 --> 00:15:57,333
They agreed to have a marriage alliance

279
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:57,843
with the Sheng family,

280
00:15:58,243 --> 00:15:59,323
because they could see the infinite future

281
00:15:59,323 --> 00:16:00,923
prospects of the Sheng family.

282
00:16:03,723 --> 00:16:05,523
Then at that time,

283
00:16:05,523 --> 00:16:07,443
we'll go to the wedding together

284
00:16:07,923 --> 00:16:09,963
and give them our congratulations and blessings.

285
00:16:15,803 --> 00:16:18,883
Mother, then you're agreeing?

286
00:16:24,756 --> 00:16:25,683
Thank you,

287
00:16:27,243 --> 00:16:28,323
Mother.

288
00:16:36,323 --> 00:16:38,203
Miss Xiaotao, getting some mails?

289
00:16:39,243 --> 00:16:40,323
It's been so long since we saw each other.

290
00:16:40,323 --> 00:16:41,443
What a coincidence to bump into you.

291
00:16:41,803 --> 00:16:42,523
What coincidence?

292
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:43,963
I especially waited for you.

293
00:16:44,683 --> 00:16:46,323
Quickly go back and tell your Sixth Miss

294
00:16:46,323 --> 00:16:47,203
that there will be a great celebratory event soon.

295
00:16:49,243 --> 00:16:50,203
Great celebratory event?

296
00:16:56,723 --> 00:16:57,443
Miss.

297
00:16:58,043 --> 00:16:58,883
Miss.

298
00:16:58,883 --> 00:16:59,923
Letter from your Aunt Wei.

299
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:15,920
Miss,

300
00:17:16,225 --> 00:17:17,465
when I went to the Urgent Delivery Shop

301
00:17:17,465 --> 00:17:18,745
earlier to claim your aunt's letter,

302
00:17:19,025 --> 00:17:19,484
I saw Buwei,

303
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,872
the attendant who serves the Young Lord.

304
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:26,203
The Young Lord asked him to relay a message

305
00:17:26,203 --> 00:17:27,683
that he has discussed things with his family.

306
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:28,322
In a few days,

307
00:17:28,322 --> 00:17:29,603
it will be the wedding of Young Lord Changbai.

308
00:17:30,196 --> 00:17:30,963
The Princess and Duke of Qi

309
00:17:30,963 --> 00:17:32,003
will be coming over to attend it.

310
00:17:32,683 --> 00:17:34,091
At that time, they will propose marriage

311
00:17:34,091 --> 00:17:34,603
to your family

312
00:17:34,603 --> 00:17:35,603
and ask your hand in marriage.

313
00:17:53,403 --> 00:17:54,843
Miss! Why are you not entering

314
00:17:54,843 --> 00:17:56,483
when you're here already?

315
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:58,483
Nanny Fang,

316
00:17:59,323 --> 00:18:00,363
I'm alright.

317
00:18:04,136 --> 00:18:05,043
Nanny Fang!

318
00:18:05,883 --> 00:18:07,163
I want to chat with Grandmother.

319
00:18:11,763 --> 00:18:13,123
Nanny Cui! Danju!

320
00:18:19,936 --> 00:18:20,923
These next few days,

321
00:18:20,923 --> 00:18:22,603
you must guard Mucang Pagoda well.

322
00:18:23,483 --> 00:18:25,163
The words that should be said must be said.

323
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,523
The people that shouldn't go out

324
00:18:28,243 --> 00:18:29,883
mustn't be allowed to leave.

325
00:18:31,203 --> 00:18:31,883
Yes.

326
00:18:37,003 --> 00:18:37,683
Xiaotao!

327
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:38,363
Here!

328
00:18:46,436 --> 00:18:46,763
Were there

329
00:18:46,763 --> 00:18:48,043
any people around

330
00:18:48,643 --> 00:18:49,923
when you were talking with your Miss today?

331
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:52,523
I know the importance of this matter.

332
00:18:53,163 --> 00:18:54,523
Only once there was no one else in the room

333
00:18:54,683 --> 00:18:55,523
and the doors were closed,

334
00:18:55,563 --> 00:18:56,683
did I go in front of Miss

335
00:18:56,683 --> 00:18:57,563
and tell her in a very low voice.

336
00:18:59,403 --> 00:19:00,483
Good child.

337
00:19:01,803 --> 00:19:03,643
Keep all those words

338
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,683
in your stomach.

339
00:19:06,283 --> 00:19:07,523
You mustn't say one more word

340
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:09,123
about it forever.

341
00:19:09,843 --> 00:19:11,043
I understand.

342
00:19:12,636 --> 00:19:13,963
You are a servant by your Miss' side.

343
00:19:14,563 --> 00:19:16,243
You grew up with her and are

344
00:19:16,243 --> 00:19:17,883
one of her most capable servants.

345
00:19:18,763 --> 00:19:20,803
If you ever leak any word

346
00:19:20,803 --> 00:19:22,083
and destroy the reputation of your Miss,

347
00:19:23,033 --> 00:19:25,043
I will cane you to death!

348
00:19:26,443 --> 00:19:27,923
I-I would never say a word,

349
00:19:27,923 --> 00:19:28,643
even if I die!

350
00:19:32,016 --> 00:19:32,683
Go now.

351
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,083
How are things

352
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,083
in the house?

353
00:19:50,843 --> 00:19:51,723
Everything's quite good.

354
00:19:52,496 --> 00:19:53,643
A few days ago, some problems came up

355
00:19:53,643 --> 00:19:55,283
in the House of Marquis of Ningyuan.

356
00:19:56,043 --> 00:19:57,643
I think Big Madam is more anxious about

357
00:19:57,643 --> 00:19:59,683
the marriage of Brother Changbai.

358
00:20:01,523 --> 00:20:02,683
I'm guessing that she won't be able to take it

359
00:20:02,683 --> 00:20:03,683
and will come here in a few days.

360
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:07,523
You're able to handle all these matters very well,

361
00:20:07,866 --> 00:20:09,463
but how come when it's your matter

362
00:20:09,523 --> 00:20:10,283
I already rejected him in front of

363
00:20:10,323 --> 00:20:11,163
my Little Mother's memorial tablet.

364
00:20:11,226 --> 00:20:12,163
You rejected him?

365
00:20:12,563 --> 00:20:14,483
Was it because you were annoyed at him

366
00:20:15,646 --> 00:20:16,763
or some other reason?

367
00:20:23,243 --> 00:20:24,723
In doing anything,

368
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:28,163
you must know very well

369
00:20:28,163 --> 00:20:29,443
first what you want.

370
00:20:31,003 --> 00:20:32,203
As a woman, even more so that

371
00:20:32,203 --> 00:20:33,643
we should think about it well.

372
00:20:34,523 --> 00:20:36,083
Don't get fooled by those books

373
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,403
written by pedantic scholars.

374
00:20:37,563 --> 00:20:38,563
Don't also get deceived

375
00:20:38,563 --> 00:20:40,683
by a moment of passion!

376
00:20:42,963 --> 00:20:44,403
Since I had already rejected him,

377
00:20:45,323 --> 00:20:46,603
I didn't think of any consequences.

378
00:20:48,883 --> 00:20:49,803
But who knew that

379
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,363
he would ask it of

380
00:20:51,363 --> 00:20:52,883
Her Highness the Princess?

381
00:20:53,896 --> 00:20:55,563
Then it means

382
00:20:55,563 --> 00:20:57,443
that he indeed loves me.

383
00:21:02,523 --> 00:21:04,163
Our family is not of high status as theirs is.

384
00:21:05,683 --> 00:21:06,750
Although men will usually marry someone lower,

385
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,923
while women would get married off to someone higher,

386
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:11,563
the difference between your father

387
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:13,283
and Duke Qi of the State is really too huge.

388
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,203
The Young Lord may be able to protect you

389
00:21:16,203 --> 00:21:18,283
but he's still a man in the front courtyard.

390
00:21:19,123 --> 00:21:19,694
He has to go out of the house

391
00:21:19,694 --> 00:21:20,290
and attend the court meetings.

392
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,163
Welcome guests in his house when he returns.

393
00:21:21,923 --> 00:21:23,403
How long can he take care of you?

394
00:21:24,203 --> 00:21:24,962
In the inner courtyard,

395
00:21:24,962 --> 00:21:26,243
it's the Princess who has the final say.

396
00:21:26,643 --> 00:21:28,883
The whole capital knows about her temper.

397
00:21:31,003 --> 00:21:32,323
I've thought about all that.

398
00:21:32,883 --> 00:21:34,203
Have you thought about the ending?

399
00:21:36,403 --> 00:21:38,323
I'm just happy,

400
00:21:38,323 --> 00:21:40,323
but I don't know what the ending will be.

401
00:22:14,043 --> 00:22:15,356
Revolting against the government is a crime

402
00:22:15,356 --> 00:22:16,803
punishable by extermination of the whole family!

403
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:18,359
For attempting to assassinate a royal prince,

404
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:19,403
your whole clan will be annihilated!

405
00:22:19,643 --> 00:22:20,883
Attack!

406
00:22:46,163 --> 00:22:46,650
Hurry!

407
00:22:50,923 --> 00:22:51,603
Hurry! Hurry!

408
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:52,723
After them!

409
00:23:46,123 --> 00:23:48,803
After him!

410
00:24:27,836 --> 00:24:29,841
Hurry! Hurry and chase them!

411
00:24:30,226 --> 00:24:31,203
Hurry!

412
00:25:27,763 --> 00:25:28,643
All of you!

413
00:25:29,243 --> 00:25:30,723
Quickly put down your weapons!

414
00:25:31,203 --> 00:25:32,376
We'll then confer on your wives and sons

415
00:25:32,376 --> 00:25:32,923
meritorious titles!

416
00:25:33,123 --> 00:25:33,803
By bringing the heads

417
00:25:33,803 --> 00:25:35,043
of the Zhao family father and son

418
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:36,203
to that virtuous old Emperor Zhao,

419
00:25:36,443 --> 00:25:37,812
our wives and children will also get conferred

420
00:25:37,812 --> 00:25:38,363
with titles anyway!

421
00:25:38,523 --> 00:25:39,683
How dare you!

422
00:25:39,803 --> 00:25:40,883
Kill!

423
00:25:41,243 --> 00:25:43,483
Kill!

424
00:27:20,443 --> 00:27:21,403
He's over there.

425
00:27:30,043 --> 00:27:31,043
Warrior,

426
00:27:31,283 --> 00:27:32,083
you saved the lives

427
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,523
of my father and I of the Zhao family.

428
00:27:33,843 --> 00:27:36,523
I, Zhao Ceying, am extremely grateful.

429
00:27:37,403 --> 00:27:39,083
I really don't know how can I repay you

430
00:27:39,083 --> 00:27:41,043
for saving our lives.

431
00:27:42,483 --> 00:27:43,283
No need to be so courteous.

432
00:27:45,283 --> 00:27:46,275
At such a young age,

433
00:27:46,363 --> 00:27:48,083
you are already this highly-skilled in martial arts.

434
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,363
May I ask for your name?

435
00:27:53,363 --> 00:27:55,163
My name is Bai Ye.

436
00:28:02,316 --> 00:28:03,003
This is the list

437
00:28:03,003 --> 00:28:04,323
of dowry items that

438
00:28:04,363 --> 00:28:05,523
that the Hai Family sent earlier.

439
00:28:05,723 --> 00:28:06,483
Miss, please take a look.

440
00:28:08,403 --> 00:28:11,003
This is the private list of Second Sister-in-law.

441
00:28:11,683 --> 00:28:13,443
It should be Mother looking at it.

442
00:28:13,723 --> 00:28:14,723
I won't look at it anymore.

443
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:17,363
Big Madam especially asked me to deliver it to you

444
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:18,283
so you can look at it.

445
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:19,043
She said that

446
00:28:19,043 --> 00:28:20,563
you're now the steward of the house.

447
00:28:20,763 --> 00:28:22,003
Even if it's private valuables,

448
00:28:22,003 --> 00:28:23,363
you have to see them.

449
00:28:24,683 --> 00:28:26,237
Mother is praising me too much.

450
00:28:26,243 --> 00:28:27,283
I'm not that important.

451
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:30,643
Okay.

452
00:28:32,696 --> 00:28:33,923
Let's treat it as though I've read it.

453
00:28:34,403 --> 00:28:36,083
Once Second Sister-in-law enters our house,

454
00:28:36,616 --> 00:28:37,803
as her younger sister-in-law,

455
00:28:37,803 --> 00:28:38,963
I can't exceed my boundary any further.

456
00:28:48,746 --> 00:28:51,003
This was separately delivered by the Hai Family.

457
00:28:51,003 --> 00:28:52,163
They said it's called, "Lifelike Flower Imitations".

458
00:28:52,456 --> 00:28:53,483
It's not worth that much.

459
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:54,883
Each lady in the house gets one.

460
00:28:55,523 --> 00:28:56,763
Just something novel to have.

461
00:28:56,763 --> 00:28:57,963
You can use it or reward it.

462
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,043
Just a small token from the House of Hai.

463
00:29:03,403 --> 00:29:04,803
So pretty.

464
00:29:04,803 --> 00:29:06,203
It looks so real.

465
00:29:07,806 --> 00:29:08,754
Second Sister-in-law hasn't been

466
00:29:08,754 --> 00:29:09,523
married into our house yet

467
00:29:09,523 --> 00:29:11,243
and she's already doting on us younger siblings.

468
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:14,563
Nanny Liu, you're not busy, right?

469
00:29:16,243 --> 00:29:17,443
Have some tea before leaving.

470
00:29:17,603 --> 00:29:19,083
I just received some xiaolongtuan tea yesterday.

471
00:29:22,563 --> 00:29:23,563
This is a Lifelike Imitation Flower sent

472
00:29:23,563 --> 00:29:24,483
by the Eldest Miss of the House of Hai.

473
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:25,443
We saved you

474
00:29:25,443 --> 00:29:26,323
the best one.

475
00:29:26,923 --> 00:29:27,643
Sister Yinxing,

476
00:29:27,643 --> 00:29:28,603
let me put it on you.

477
00:29:36,163 --> 00:29:37,123
Why are you crying?

478
00:29:37,563 --> 00:29:39,203
You're totally bringing embarrassment to Big Madam!

479
00:29:39,443 --> 00:29:40,363
On such a joyous occasion,

480
00:29:40,363 --> 00:29:41,403
you're bringing in bad luck!

481
00:29:41,403 --> 00:29:42,963
M-My crying is none of your business.

482
00:29:42,963 --> 00:29:44,163
I'm not really provoking you.

483
00:29:44,986 --> 00:29:45,963
We're serving in the courtyard

484
00:29:45,963 --> 00:29:46,523
of Sixth Miss

485
00:29:46,563 --> 00:29:47,276
and talking about the marriage

486
00:29:47,276 --> 00:29:47,843
of Eldest Young Master.

487
00:29:48,563 --> 00:29:49,374
You instead are bringing bad luck

488
00:29:49,374 --> 00:29:50,083
to the family of the Master.

489
00:29:50,296 --> 00:29:50,923
If you want to cry,

490
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:52,123
go cry in the garden!

491
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,123
Don't wail like you're at a funeral here.

492
00:29:53,963 --> 00:29:55,403
You have your mother, Nanny Liu, covering for you.

493
00:29:55,603 --> 00:29:56,283
You are so bossy

494
00:29:56,283 --> 00:29:57,403
wherever you go.

495
00:29:57,563 --> 00:29:58,403
Ask the people here if anybody

496
00:29:58,403 --> 00:29:59,323
gives you any importance!

497
00:29:59,523 --> 00:30:00,363
If they don't give me any importance,

498
00:30:00,363 --> 00:30:00,883
do they give you any?

499
00:30:01,443 --> 00:30:02,683
Whenever the Second Brother comes here,

500
00:30:02,683 --> 00:30:03,763
you have to approach him and talk.

501
00:30:03,923 --> 00:30:05,083
Do you have the right to do so?

502
00:30:05,243 --> 00:30:06,123
What nonsense are you saying!

503
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:07,923
You are out there

504
00:30:07,923 --> 00:30:09,123
trying to seduce the Second Brother and Third Brother

505
00:30:09,563 --> 00:30:10,123
Why don't you

506
00:30:10,123 --> 00:30:11,203
look at yourself first?

507
00:30:11,786 --> 00:30:13,043
What does this got to do with our Third Brother?

508
00:30:13,096 --> 00:30:14,022
If you want to scold this cheap bitch,

509
00:30:14,022 --> 00:30:14,363
just scold her.

510
00:30:14,363 --> 00:30:15,283
Don't involve our Third Brother!

511
00:30:15,846 --> 00:30:17,043
Even if she's lowly,

512
00:30:17,443 --> 00:30:18,323
she's still doing her tasks as a maidservant

513
00:30:18,323 --> 00:30:19,123
in an earnest manner.

514
00:30:19,603 --> 00:30:21,043
Unlike you two,

515
00:30:21,043 --> 00:30:21,650
losing your chastity but not

516
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:22,323
getting taken in as concubines

517
00:30:22,483 --> 00:30:23,843
Anxiously getting sent to this courtyard

518
00:30:23,843 --> 00:30:24,683
and even talking back to Miss!

519
00:30:24,746 --> 00:30:25,803
Bitch,

520
00:30:25,843 --> 00:30:26,523
what did you say!

521
00:30:26,523 --> 00:30:27,083
See if I don't tear your mouth today!

522
00:30:27,723 --> 00:30:29,563
Stop fighting! Stop fighting!

523
00:30:29,723 --> 00:30:31,883
Stop fighting! Stop fighting!

524
00:30:32,003 --> 00:30:32,523
Stop fighting!

525
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:40,203
This is so preposterous!

526
00:30:40,716 --> 00:30:42,123
Miss, you should hurry and handle them.

527
00:30:44,283 --> 00:30:45,803
Right, they must be punished.

528
00:30:47,723 --> 00:30:48,643
I think

529
00:30:50,603 --> 00:30:51,923
Just punish them to lose half a month's salary.

530
00:30:54,843 --> 00:30:56,643
Sixth Miss, you're too kind.

531
00:30:56,923 --> 00:30:58,563
But we heard in our courtyard

532
00:30:58,883 --> 00:31:00,203
that Ke'er woman

533
00:31:00,443 --> 00:31:01,523
had her hands all over Third Brother

534
00:31:01,523 --> 00:31:02,923
while they were walking out in the streets!

535
00:31:04,203 --> 00:31:04,923
A steward doesn't

536
00:31:04,923 --> 00:31:06,963
only manage money and grains.

537
00:31:07,203 --> 00:31:08,883
What's most important is the house's

538
00:31:08,883 --> 00:31:10,363
atmosphere and reputation.

539
00:31:11,763 --> 00:31:13,243
Nanny Liu, look at what you're saying.

540
00:31:13,883 --> 00:31:14,683
Ke'er was originally

541
00:31:14,683 --> 00:31:15,963
from Third Brother's house.

542
00:31:16,563 --> 00:31:17,527
Third Brother bore the separation

543
00:31:17,527 --> 00:31:18,509
from his love and gave her to me.

544
00:31:19,563 --> 00:31:20,283
Now that she's here,

545
00:31:20,283 --> 00:31:21,563
I should dote on her.

546
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,403
If I punish her just

547
00:31:23,403 --> 00:31:24,403
because of a measly matter,

548
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:26,763
if Third Older Brother finds out,

549
00:31:27,203 --> 00:31:28,643
he will blame me

550
00:31:28,683 --> 00:31:31,603
and I will like an ingrate.

551
00:31:31,843 --> 00:31:33,683
This, how is this a measly matter?

552
00:31:33,963 --> 00:31:35,683
They were already brawling inside your courtyard!

553
00:31:36,763 --> 00:31:39,203
Moreover, not only Ke'er,

554
00:31:39,443 --> 00:31:40,843
but when Second Brother comes

555
00:31:40,843 --> 00:31:43,003
that Yinxing will also frequently talk with him.

556
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:45,345
They were just missing their old masters.

557
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,465
It's just normal.

558
00:31:52,803 --> 00:31:54,643
After hearing those words from Sixth Miss,

559
00:31:54,723 --> 00:31:56,363
I knew immediately that she's a weakling

560
00:31:56,363 --> 00:31:57,643
who won't dare to fight.

561
00:31:59,323 --> 00:32:00,483
First, I went to

562
00:32:00,483 --> 00:32:01,163
hit my Jiu'er,

563
00:32:01,523 --> 00:32:02,723
and then started scolding Yinxing.

564
00:32:03,523 --> 00:32:05,083
I told her to behave

565
00:32:05,843 --> 00:32:06,683
and stop having wild imaginations

566
00:32:06,683 --> 00:32:08,003
about our Second Brother.

567
00:32:09,563 --> 00:32:10,923
Who knew that

568
00:32:11,123 --> 00:32:12,603
servant would

569
00:32:12,603 --> 00:32:13,403
tell me,

570
00:32:14,363 --> 00:32:17,323
"Nanny, stop worrying too much.

571
00:32:17,843 --> 00:32:18,443
I'm currently working

572
00:32:18,443 --> 00:32:19,883
under Sixth Miss.

573
00:32:20,363 --> 00:32:22,003
When Miss hasn't said anything,

574
00:32:22,003 --> 00:32:23,563
why are you meddling?"

575
00:32:24,996 --> 00:32:27,563
Big Madam, Eldest Miss Hai

576
00:32:27,563 --> 00:32:28,763
will be married into our house soon.

577
00:32:29,803 --> 00:32:31,283
The House of Gu was turned upside down

578
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,403
just because of a woman.

579
00:32:32,683 --> 00:32:33,883
If the same act

580
00:32:33,883 --> 00:32:35,043
happens to our Sheng family too,

581
00:32:35,643 --> 00:32:36,523
it will not be—

582
00:32:36,596 --> 00:32:37,603
Nobody should dare

583
00:32:37,603 --> 00:32:39,243
hinder my Changbai's path.

584
00:32:40,843 --> 00:32:41,923
Handle them all.

585
00:32:43,123 --> 00:32:43,763
All?

586
00:32:45,883 --> 00:32:47,483
We mustn't leave our people there,

587
00:32:48,696 --> 00:32:50,123
but even more so, we must cut off the spies

588
00:32:50,123 --> 00:32:51,243
of that bitch in the adjacent house.

589
00:33:09,163 --> 00:33:10,923
You all have acted inappropriately.

590
00:33:12,563 --> 00:33:13,963
You even showed it to

591
00:33:13,963 --> 00:33:14,603
a guest like Nanny Liu.

592
00:33:14,963 --> 00:33:16,563
Today, I have no choice but to punish you all.

593
00:33:17,683 --> 00:33:18,643
Those that got involved in the fight

594
00:33:19,363 --> 00:33:20,723
would have no salary for half a month.

595
00:33:27,643 --> 00:33:30,763
M-Mother. Mother, you've come.

596
00:33:33,603 --> 00:33:35,963
Since you're so kind and lenient,

597
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:38,523
I'll be the bad person.

598
00:33:39,403 --> 00:33:40,723
Mother, don't worry.

599
00:33:41,123 --> 00:33:42,483
I've already punished them earlier.

600
00:33:43,003 --> 00:33:44,843
From now on, they all will surely work hard.

601
00:33:47,403 --> 00:33:50,403
You are still too young.

602
00:33:52,803 --> 00:33:54,763
Although you're now handling the whole house,

603
00:33:55,263 --> 00:33:56,359
and there are indeed books to

604
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:57,523
show the ins and outs of silver,

605
00:33:58,723 --> 00:34:00,963
you are clueless in the art

606
00:34:00,963 --> 00:34:02,683
of governing your subordinates.

607
00:34:04,503 --> 00:34:06,403
It's also my fault for not clearly teaching you.

608
00:34:07,883 --> 00:34:09,763
Today, I'll help you handle this matter.

609
00:34:09,763 --> 00:34:10,963
Stay on the side and watch.

610
00:34:12,443 --> 00:34:13,963
Take it as a lesson from me.

611
00:34:15,023 --> 00:34:16,003
Mother.

612
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:17,980
Mother if you're like this

613
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:18,883
there are also servants here

614
00:34:18,883 --> 00:34:20,323
that are from the courtyard of Third Older Brother.

615
00:34:20,323 --> 00:34:21,603
You think I'm afraid of him?

616
00:34:29,643 --> 00:34:31,163
Jiu'er, serve tea.

617
00:34:31,723 --> 00:34:32,363
Yes.

618
00:35:09,763 --> 00:35:12,603
I heard that you've been quite bossy around here.

619
00:35:15,133 --> 00:35:16,443
Sixth Miss didn't punish you

620
00:35:16,443 --> 00:35:17,803
because she's benevolent.

621
00:35:18,263 --> 00:35:19,363
But you behave even more bossy.

622
00:35:19,363 --> 00:35:20,843
You became even haughtier and a show-off.

623
00:35:21,263 --> 00:35:22,083
Big Madam, please forgive me!

624
00:35:22,723 --> 00:35:24,563
I was earnestly thinking about Miss

625
00:35:24,563 --> 00:35:25,683
and thus a little nagging.

626
00:35:26,516 --> 00:35:27,763
Since you love to nag,

627
00:35:28,163 --> 00:35:29,003
return to my courtyard

628
00:35:29,003 --> 00:35:30,203
to nag at me then.

629
00:35:30,426 --> 00:35:30,963
I

630
00:35:31,283 --> 00:35:32,323
Quickly leave.

631
00:35:53,683 --> 00:35:55,483
Which one is Ke'er?

632
00:35:57,523 --> 00:35:58,403
I'm here.

633
00:36:01,803 --> 00:36:03,803
You indeed are delicately pretty and pitiable.

634
00:36:05,803 --> 00:36:07,826
I heard that you recite and write

635
00:36:07,826 --> 00:36:08,763
poems every day

636
00:36:08,763 --> 00:36:09,763
arrange flowers and make teas.

637
00:36:10,373 --> 00:36:11,763
You act like you're not here to attend to someone,

638
00:36:12,243 --> 00:36:14,203
but to be a daughter of the house yourself.

639
00:36:15,163 --> 00:36:17,763
I also fulfill my tasks.

640
00:36:18,346 --> 00:36:20,123
I only do those things

641
00:36:20,123 --> 00:36:21,523
when I'm at leisure.

642
00:36:25,443 --> 00:36:26,683
Lowly slave!

643
00:36:26,683 --> 00:36:28,003
You dare answer back to Big Madam!

644
00:36:28,203 --> 00:36:29,243
Where did you learn the rules?

645
00:36:29,843 --> 00:36:30,734
If you dare say one more word,

646
00:36:30,734 --> 00:36:31,763
I'll hit your mouth until it rots!

647
00:36:34,083 --> 00:36:35,603
It's fine if you want to recite and make poems.

648
00:36:35,683 --> 00:36:36,264
Let's treat it as you

649
00:36:36,264 --> 00:36:37,163
trying to pose as a culture lover!

650
00:36:37,723 --> 00:36:38,563
But you just have to flatter

651
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:40,523
and touch the Third Young Master of this house.

652
00:36:41,043 --> 00:36:41,723
If you miss

653
00:36:41,763 --> 00:36:42,683
your original master

654
00:36:42,723 --> 00:36:43,643
why did you bother coming here?

655
00:36:44,643 --> 00:36:46,723
Servants! Push her down and cane her!

656
00:36:47,675 --> 00:36:48,603
Big Madam,

657
00:36:48,603 --> 00:36:49,523
it is Third Brother

658
00:36:49,563 --> 00:36:50,563
who usually pulls me aside for chats!

659
00:36:50,646 --> 00:36:51,683
It's not my fault,

660
00:36:51,683 --> 00:36:52,483
Big Madam!

661
00:36:53,683 --> 00:36:54,363
Big Madam,

662
00:36:54,363 --> 00:36:55,803
it is Third Brother

663
00:36:55,803 --> 00:36:57,083
who usually pulls me aside for chats!

664
00:36:57,136 --> 00:36:58,803
It's not my fault,

665
00:36:58,803 --> 00:36:59,923
Big Madam!

666
00:37:04,283 --> 00:37:04,883
Don't move.

667
00:37:06,083 --> 00:37:07,003
Just try moving!

668
00:37:09,643 --> 00:37:10,523
Yinxing.

669
00:37:12,843 --> 00:37:14,523
Why are you kneeling that far away?

670
00:37:14,603 --> 00:37:15,723
Come here in front of me.

671
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:25,443
Are you and Ke'er close?

672
00:37:26,563 --> 00:37:27,563
Not really.

673
00:37:29,523 --> 00:37:30,203
I think you two must be

674
00:37:30,203 --> 00:37:32,123
treating each other like real sisters..

675
00:37:32,923 --> 00:37:34,923
otherwise,

676
00:37:34,963 --> 00:37:36,163
why are your actions are so similar?

677
00:37:36,203 --> 00:37:37,243
No! No such thing!

678
00:37:39,563 --> 00:37:40,323
Really?

679
00:37:42,203 --> 00:37:44,563
Then go kneel over there and look at her.

680
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:46,181
Go and count the strokes

681
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:47,043
of the cane she's getting.

682
00:37:50,363 --> 00:37:51,203
Go on!

683
00:37:55,443 --> 00:37:56,283
Hit her!

684
00:37:56,936 --> 00:37:57,563
One.

685
00:37:59,043 --> 00:37:59,763
Two.

686
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:02,123
Three.

687
00:38:03,243 --> 00:38:04,203
Four.

688
00:38:05,603 --> 00:38:06,523
Five.

689
00:38:08,363 --> 00:38:09,123
Six.

690
00:38:11,043 --> 00:38:11,803
Seven.

691
00:38:13,683 --> 00:38:14,483
Eight.

692
00:38:16,603 --> 00:38:17,443
Nine.

693
00:38:18,523 --> 00:38:19,843
Ten.

694
00:38:22,283 --> 00:38:23,483
She has fainted

695
00:38:29,043 --> 00:38:31,403
Big Madam, she has fainted.

696
00:38:33,643 --> 00:38:35,163
Okay then.

697
00:38:35,163 --> 00:38:36,443
Send for a doctor.

698
00:38:37,376 --> 00:38:38,803
Send her back to Linqi Pavilion

699
00:38:38,803 --> 00:38:39,923
and hand her over to Third Brother.

700
00:38:40,163 --> 00:38:41,083
Yes.

701
00:38:45,643 --> 00:38:46,563
Yinxing.

702
00:38:48,363 --> 00:38:49,003
Big Madam,

703
00:38:49,163 --> 00:38:50,283
I...I heard that you still miss

704
00:38:50,283 --> 00:38:51,203
the people in my courtyard.

705
00:38:52,523 --> 00:38:53,363
Since that's the case,

706
00:38:53,963 --> 00:38:55,363
come back with me then.

707
00:38:56,473 --> 00:38:58,363
Big Madam, please spare my life!

708
00:38:59,323 --> 00:39:00,243
Sixth Miss,

709
00:39:00,243 --> 00:39:01,203
save me!

710
00:39:02,846 --> 00:39:04,683
Mother, why not...

711
00:39:04,683 --> 00:39:06,563
You were unable to manage this matter well

712
00:39:07,043 --> 00:39:09,123
and caused your courtyard to be so messed up.

713
00:39:09,843 --> 00:39:11,003
I'm helping you handle it,

714
00:39:11,523 --> 00:39:13,403
so stop being a good person

715
00:39:13,403 --> 00:39:14,883
and destroying my approach.

716
00:39:40,923 --> 00:39:42,463
I heard that you've broken

717
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,643
four or five tea cups.

718
00:39:44,803 --> 00:39:46,403
You've also broken items

719
00:39:46,403 --> 00:39:47,643
from our hometown in Youyang.

720
00:39:49,243 --> 00:39:50,683
You are so bold!

721
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:53,563
In the whole capital

722
00:39:53,563 --> 00:39:54,563
who can bear to support such a maid like you?

723
00:39:56,163 --> 00:39:56,963
Nanny Liu,

724
00:39:57,283 --> 00:39:58,203
take her contract and

725
00:39:58,203 --> 00:39:59,163
find a slave dealer to dispose of her.

726
00:39:59,763 --> 00:40:00,483
Yes.

727
00:40:21,483 --> 00:40:22,403
Grandmother,

728
00:40:22,403 --> 00:40:24,243
let me choose a fragrance for you.

729
00:40:25,443 --> 00:40:26,203
Put it down.

730
00:40:39,596 --> 00:40:40,563
Hence,

731
00:40:42,123 --> 00:40:43,963
everything was deliberate.

732
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:53,323
You deliberately tolerated

733
00:40:53,323 --> 00:40:54,763
those servants they sent.

734
00:40:55,883 --> 00:40:56,837
Indulged them into having exaggerated

735
00:40:56,837 --> 00:40:57,683
opinions about their capabilities.

736
00:40:58,443 --> 00:41:01,043
One by one, either they disturbed Changbai,

737
00:41:01,483 --> 00:41:03,243
or seduced Changfeng?

738
00:41:03,243 --> 00:41:04,363
Otherwise

739
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:07,403
they bossed around your household

740
00:41:07,403 --> 00:41:08,723
and kept breaking your dishes and bowls.

741
00:41:12,243 --> 00:41:13,083
Yes.

742
00:41:15,163 --> 00:41:16,803
You clearly know that person in Linqi Pavilion

743
00:41:16,803 --> 00:41:19,043
doesn't like Ke'er.

744
00:41:20,003 --> 00:41:21,763
That's why she placed her in your house.

745
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:23,923
I know.

746
00:41:24,763 --> 00:41:26,483
That Ke'er has a gentle and weak temperament.

747
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,093
She only knows to rely on Third Brother.

748
00:41:29,123 --> 00:41:30,363
Hence, whenever Third Brother came,

749
00:41:30,803 --> 00:41:32,283
I would let Ke'er wait for him on the path

750
00:41:32,283 --> 00:41:33,763
that he surely would take.

751
00:41:34,563 --> 00:41:36,323
How did you come up with this idea?

752
00:41:36,683 --> 00:41:37,483
I was thinking

753
00:41:37,483 --> 00:41:38,883
that if Big Madam

754
00:41:38,936 --> 00:41:40,963
learns that she can have a chance to put her back

755
00:41:40,963 --> 00:41:42,003
with her old master and disgust Mistress Lin,

756
00:41:42,363 --> 00:41:43,803
she surely won't let the chance go.

757
00:41:44,883 --> 00:41:46,683
You calculated this move very precisely.

758
00:41:48,643 --> 00:41:49,763
It was also you

759
00:41:49,763 --> 00:41:51,003
who indulged those few others?

760
00:41:54,563 --> 00:41:55,403
Yes.

761
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:57,683
You don't know this,

762
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:01,243
but that Mei'er kept scanning through my things.

763
00:42:02,283 --> 00:42:03,203
Whatever she finds,

764
00:42:03,203 --> 00:42:04,643
she reports it to Mistress Lin.

765
00:42:05,603 --> 00:42:07,403
Big Madam has long wanted that item

766
00:42:07,403 --> 00:42:08,403
that Teacher Da Yuchuan

767
00:42:08,643 --> 00:42:10,163
sent me from Youyang .

768
00:42:10,763 --> 00:42:12,283
I know that once it breaks,

769
00:42:12,683 --> 00:42:13,883
Jiu'er will immediately

770
00:42:13,883 --> 00:42:14,643
go back to tell it to her.

771
00:42:15,763 --> 00:42:17,003
That Jiu'er is

772
00:42:17,003 --> 00:42:17,883
actually not much of a problem.

773
00:42:18,173 --> 00:42:20,003
It's that Yinxing that's a bit hard to handle.

774
00:42:20,533 --> 00:42:21,803
She's after all

775
00:42:21,843 --> 00:42:22,643
a spy from Big Madam.

776
00:42:23,363 --> 00:42:24,363
The good thing is

777
00:42:24,363 --> 00:42:25,843
she has special feelings for Second Brother.

778
00:42:28,123 --> 00:42:28,803
Nanny Liu

779
00:42:29,163 --> 00:42:30,843
actually scolded her

780
00:42:30,843 --> 00:42:31,763
about this matter before.

781
00:42:32,163 --> 00:42:33,403
I even stopped Nanny Liu

782
00:42:33,403 --> 00:42:34,643
from doing it.

783
00:42:35,536 --> 00:42:36,963
Who knew that Yinxing would become so unruly

784
00:42:36,963 --> 00:42:38,483
because of my tolerance.

785
00:42:40,003 --> 00:42:40,842
She kept chasing after Second Brother

786
00:42:40,842 --> 00:42:41,483
to personally attend to him.

787
00:42:41,923 --> 00:42:43,003
Second Brother

788
00:42:43,003 --> 00:42:44,603
is Big Madam's favorite child.

789
00:42:46,203 --> 00:42:46,803
I

790
00:42:48,723 --> 00:42:49,203
I

791
00:42:52,523 --> 00:42:53,963
You said that you were wrong?

792
00:42:56,843 --> 00:42:58,323
How were you wrong?

793
00:42:58,323 --> 00:42:59,443
Tell me.
