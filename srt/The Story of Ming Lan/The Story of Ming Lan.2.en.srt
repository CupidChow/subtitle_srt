00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,200
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,400
Episode 2

3
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,839
Last night, I dreamed of flowers falling down

4
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:13,680
into a quiet, deep pool.

5
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,720
It is so pitiful that half of spring has passed

6
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,480
yet I haven't returned home.

7
00:01:17,279 --> 00:01:18,879
A Flowery Moonlit Night by Spring River.

8
00:01:20,279 --> 00:01:21,000
Good.

9
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:23,599
Zhang Ruoxu

10
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:25,959
was a great prodigy in Yangzhou.

11
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,839
It was all taught to me by my mother.

12
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,519
She's a talented one.

13
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,680
You are her daughter.

14
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,959
So you take after her naturally.

15
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,919
Your Sixth Sister

16
00:01:37,919 --> 00:01:39,879
already came to wish me good health.

17
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:42,800
I made some flaky pastries

18
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,760
for her to take back.

19
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,000
You go out and have some too.

20
00:01:48,279 --> 00:01:49,879
I studied for many days

21
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,400
to learn this whole thing.

22
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,480
Let me read it all to Grandmother.

23
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,680
You haven't had breakfast yet.

24
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,319
Go now.

25
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,199
The flaky pastries are still hot.

26
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:04,040
Fourth Miss, go to try them.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,760
Come on.

28
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,320
I said I wouldn't go,

29
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,279
but you just made me go!

30
00:02:24,399 --> 00:02:25,839
She's not the biological mother of my father,

31
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:26,919
and she hates you!

32
00:02:27,119 --> 00:02:28,600
How can she be satisfied with me?

33
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,679
She just wants to drive me out.

34
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,279
She is so harsh with me.

35
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:33,759
I will never go there again! Never!

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,160
She's your grandmother.

37
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,600
Even if your father tells you not to go,

38
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,759
you still should go there

39
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,720
to serve on her side.

40
00:02:40,399 --> 00:02:41,800
She told you to go to have breakfast,

41
00:02:41,839 --> 00:02:42,919
and it was because she was considerate of you.

42
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,320
But look at how arrogant you were!

43
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,960
It seems that I am no longer fit to teach you well.

44
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,320
From tomorrow on,

45
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,440
you will go to find the Madam and learn from her.

46
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,000
Mother.

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,839
Mother!

48
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,479
The physician said

49
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:03,119
your old illness was so serious.

50
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,080
It stemmed from depression and loneliness, he said.

51
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,800
These days,

52
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:10,160
these children are serving you by your side, Mother.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,279
If there is anyone you are fond of,

54
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:13,559
just keep her by your side,

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,720
so you can

56
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,759
laugh a few times watching the children play.

57
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,679
I'm old

58
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:20,839
and I can't handle any exhaustion.

59
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,119
I only wish for a quiet life.

60
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,000
It's no rush, mother.

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,119
You may give it some thoughts before telling me your decision.

62
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,839
Mo'er.

63
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:37,039
You're already over nine years old.

64
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,960
You should have become sensible already.

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,800
But today,

66
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,000
the bowls and cups you broke,

67
00:03:42,559 --> 00:03:44,320
their costs would be enough for the outsiders to live on for a year.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,960
Do you want to

69
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,240
suffer that plight in the future?

70
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,000
No, Mother. I was scared!

71
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,960
Grandmother was watching me and I was scared.

72
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,880
Mo'er, don't be scared.

73
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,639
Don't be scared.

74
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,119
Your grandmother is a softy.

75
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
In the future,

76
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,800
if Grandmother says today's a good day,

77
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,720
don't say it's rainy.

78
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,080
If she says it's cloudy,

79
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,239
don't say it's sunny.

80
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,920
Coax her to be happy,

81
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,640
and she will be good to you. Alright?

82
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,640
Mo'er.

83
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,200
I heard that

84
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,279
you had reprimanded Changfeng.

85
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,040
That's great.

86
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,000
One ought to love one's son deeply

87
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,600
and teach him strictly.

88
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,920
That's how a grand house runs.

89
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:50,000
Yes.

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,399
Thanks to the Sixth Miss,

91
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,079
or our Sheng's prestige

92
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,679
would need to be fetched back from half a kilometer away.

93
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:03,040
Have you gone over to see them?

94
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:06,079
I ignored this.

95
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:06,760
I will go now.

96
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:11,720
Father!

97
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,600
Ming'er. Why are you still here?

98
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,200
I wanted to see Father.

99
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,440
I am going to

100
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,519
the Madam's room.

101
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,519
Do you want to

102
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,440
come with me?

103
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,920
Father, please go to see my mother.

104
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,200
Today I had a lot to do at the magistrate office.

105
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,040
A bit later

106
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,959
and I will come to your room for sure.

107
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,000
Alright?

108
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,119
Alright.

109
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,839
This is for you.

110
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:53,559
This was gifted to you by Grandmother, right?

111
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,440
You can eat it.

112
00:05:58,239 --> 00:05:59,440
Go and tell your mother now.

113
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:20,440
That child. Look! How happy she is.

114
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,200
I haven't had a chance to go.

115
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,679
So your father…

116
00:06:33,679 --> 00:06:35,079
did he go to visit the Old Madam today?

117
00:06:37,239 --> 00:06:38,440
He said he would come today for sure.

118
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:44,239
Minglan,

119
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:45,440
since your father is coming,

120
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,119
the charcoal or food whatsoever,

121
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:48,239
you can't mention a word about them.

122
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:49,239
Did you hear me?

123
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,320
Where's the access card?

124
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:08,000
I am from Mistress Wei's courtyard.

125
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,519
You don't recognize me?

126
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,959
We just finished the banquet and

127
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,119
so many objects are being brought in or out.

128
00:07:12,119 --> 00:07:13,600
If someone

129
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,760
takes something out,

130
00:07:15,359 --> 00:07:16,519
we can't argue that out.

131
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,679
A basket full of smoky charcoal from the stove.

132
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:24,040
How can it be valuable?

133
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,320
People in their courtyard

134
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,679
are just so skilled.

135
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:30,279
One will deliver a baby,

136
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,399
and the other plays pot-pitching marvelously!

137
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,359
You better be careful,

138
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:35,720
or her Mistress may tell on you,

139
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,320
and you'll be beaten up!

140
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:51,119
Thank you so much.

141
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,399
Or else when the Master comes,

142
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:53,760
we won't have any charcoal to serve him.

143
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,359
Sister, hurry up.

144
00:07:55,359 --> 00:07:56,920
I'll wait for you here.

145
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,679
Thanks.

146
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,440
Come.

147
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:43,760
Take this inside.

148
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,880
The last table by the window.

149
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:10,799
My father once saved an old lady

150
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:11,919
from being wrongfully condemned in jail.

151
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,359
Her son is an accomplished scholar.

152
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,280
Brother Zhonghuai, why don't you study with me

153
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:17,599
and prepare for the

154
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,359
preliminary round of Imperial exams together?

155
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,640
I come from a military family

156
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,039
and I am not patient.

157
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,320
That's quite alright.

158
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,159
One of us can learn the martial arts,

159
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:25,760
and the other the literary prowess.

160
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,679
Together, we can recover the lost lands and build our feats.

161
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,679
If one day,

162
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:33,760
I can fight on the border

163
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,840
to recover our land that's lost,

164
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,159
I would die without any regret.

165
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,679
Young Master!

166
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:44,599
Run, quick! Young Master.

167
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,159
Zhonghuai, help me.

168
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,320
Zhonghuai, help me.

169
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:49,919
Father!

170
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:55,760
Mistress!

171
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,000
Master.

172
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:27,599
So Mistress Wei already heard of it.

173
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:30,640
Shuyi,

174
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,080
you didn't see it in the front courtyard yesterday.

175
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:34,719
Minglan did a great job in playing pot-pitching.

176
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,640
Just a petty game

177
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,479
for amusement.

178
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,760
Master is speaking of it with so much zeal.

179
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:43,599
I regret so much

180
00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:44,719
I didn't go to take a look.

181
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,359
Hualan told me

182
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:48,239
to bring you that.

183
00:12:48,239 --> 00:12:49,159
She said she would come tomorrow personally

184
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:51,080
to thank you and your daughter.

185
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:55,119
Master, please wash your hands.

186
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,840
Sister Xiaodie,

187
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,440
how much good charcoal did you get?

188
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,640
Only a bit over half a kilo.

189
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,960
It will be all gone after tonight.

190
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:06,440
Father is here.

191
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,280
From this day onwards, we'll have charcoal.

192
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,479
Go, let's make tea.

193
00:13:12,119 --> 00:13:12,799
That Minglan you raised

194
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:13,919
is such a good child.

195
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:16,080
She earned respect for the entire family yesterday.

196
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:18,880
It's all because

197
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,919
she's learned a lot from Old Madam lately.

198
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,679
I only hope that

199
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:27,000
she won't be unworthy of Old Madam and Master's love.

200
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,119
Whichever girl Old Madam has come to be fond of,

201
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,440
it will be that child's blessing.

202
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:35,320
Indeed it is.

203
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,080
You've come to my house for so many years already.

204
00:13:54,719 --> 00:13:56,559
But I never know you can play pot-pitching?

205
00:13:57,719 --> 00:13:58,840
It was all taught to me

206
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,719
when my father was still alive.

207
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,640
Just a country people's trick.

208
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:04,840
It's not worth mentioning.

209
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:06,239
A gentleman should have six talents

210
00:14:06,239 --> 00:14:07,239
and shooting is the fifth.

211
00:14:07,239 --> 00:14:08,599
How can it be a small trick?

212
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:14,719
Master,

213
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:16,359
try this good tea.

214
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:20,320
This is all the charcoal we have in our room.

215
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,119
It's cold in here,

216
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:22,239
so father, drink it and warm up a bit.

217
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:26,559
It is pretty cold in the room.

218
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,280
A woman's body is hot while pregnant.

219
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:33,159
Though

220
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:34,320
it's already snowing outside now,

221
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,919
my body is still sweating.

222
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:39,799
Even this little bit isn't needed.

223
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:42,280
I only hope they will extinguish it.

224
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,440
Even so,

225
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,039
beware that the windows should be shut

226
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,159
so you don't catch a chill.

227
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,200
Since Master feels cold,

228
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,200
why don't you go back?

229
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:55,640
There are so many things for you to tend to lately.

230
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,080
You can't catch a chill either.

231
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:58,679
Tomorrow

232
00:14:58,719 --> 00:15:00,719
I will bring the Sixth Miss to pay respects to her Grandmother,

233
00:15:01,239 --> 00:15:02,520
and give thanks for the Eldest Miss's gift.

234
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,919
Fine then.

235
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,919
Father.

236
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:15,679
My mother lied to you.

237
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,599
Minglan.

238
00:15:17,119 --> 00:15:17,679
She lied to me?

239
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:18,280
Minglan!

240
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,440
About what?

241
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,599
We never get the charcoal

242
00:15:20,599 --> 00:15:23,479
we are supposed to be issued, father!

243
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,359
Father, may the Heaven pity us.

244
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,159
Yesterday Mother was shaking from the cold.

245
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,359
Your daughter had to hold her to sleep.

246
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,919
The talk of a small child can't be taken seriously.

247
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:41,359
Father, come look.

248
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:43,799
Yesterday Sister Xiaodie went to get charcoal.

249
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:44,960
They shoved this to her.

250
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,400
It can't be burned inside the room.

251
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,799
It made our room full of smoke.

252
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:49,880
This here is the last bit!

253
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:51,039
After tonight,

254
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,760
we don't even know if we'll have any tomorrow.

255
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,840
There are so many matters to tend to in the house.

256
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,719
What do you know?

257
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,320
Father, come to have a look.

258
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,880
Even the tea

259
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,359
has been saved for special occasions for a long time too.

260
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,960
Only when a noble guest like you comes

261
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:09,280
will we spare to take out a bit to drink.

262
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,640
The flaky cakes Grandmother gave us

263
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,159
need to be stored for guests later too.

264
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:15,320
We don't even get enough to eat for our meals!

265
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:23,640
You never told this to me.

266
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:26,520
Mother said you were busy toiling with work.

267
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:27,599
She endured

268
00:16:27,599 --> 00:16:29,159
and wouldn't allow us to tell you a word.

269
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,239
It's all due to Ming'er being a food craver.

270
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,159
You can't take her words seriously.

271
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,840
Is this really true?

272
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:40,200
No.

273
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,919
Look at me and say it.

274
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,680
You are treated unfairly.

275
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,800
I am not.

276
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:14,160
I only hope that

277
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,959
you don't startle everyone.

278
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,199
In this manor,

279
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,640
I am still the Master!

280
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:40,280
Does it hurt?

281
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,760
Mother, don't cry.

282
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,760
Father said he would seek justice for us.

283
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,400
That helper surnamed Bai

284
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,800
is quite skillful.

285
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,000
He could pull our Brother Bai

286
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,920
out of the study to go out and play.

287
00:18:12,719 --> 00:18:14,359
Did you find out anything?

288
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,439
Or we can let Caihuan

289
00:18:15,479 --> 00:18:16,719
go and find out?

290
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:18,160
Yes.

291
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,920
Don't you see me coming in anger?

292
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:52,199
You act like nothing is wrong.

293
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:56,640
Ask the entire city of Yangzhou,

294
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,079
is there another Madam like you?

295
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,400
What?

296
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,920
There's only one in my manor.

297
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,680
You wanted to be virtuous,

298
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,800
so you insisted on buying her to enhance my prestige.

299
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,040
Now you came to be jealous of her,

300
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,920
and you just started ruining a person for no reason.

301
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:16,199
You don't even give her food!

302
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,439
What house has a Madam like you?

303
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,239
Wei Shuyi?

304
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:26,479
She dared to mess with me, too?

305
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:28,040
What?

306
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,239
Seeing how that Mistress Lin is favored

307
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:31,479
and her daughter made a name once,

308
00:19:31,479 --> 00:19:33,119
she wants to climb over me too?

309
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,640
Your Sheng House for sure tends to

310
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,000
forget your humble friend when being prosperous!

311
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,640
I can just quit being the Madam here

312
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,439
and be your concubine here instead!

313
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:43,239
You don't need to make a scene.

314
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,880
If you have any conscience…

315
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,959
Conscience?

316
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:47,520
You know any conscience?

317
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,680
Who's the one that lacks it?

318
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,599
You!

319
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:51,319
I just came from there.

320
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:52,479
That room is like an icy cave.

321
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,079
You don't even give her any charcoal

322
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:56,560
when she's pregnant!

323
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:00,479
Master.

324
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:01,319
My mistress, Madam here…

325
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,959
She is quick-tempered.

326
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:05,319
But I still remember.

327
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:07,479
Due to the marriage for the Eldest Miss,

328
00:20:07,479 --> 00:20:09,520
and she has to tend Old Madam for her illness too,

329
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,199
it's you gave the order

330
00:20:11,199 --> 00:20:12,479
to hand the keys

331
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,359
to Mistress Lin to manage.

332
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:16,520
Mistress Wei's allotments

333
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,040
are under her care too.

334
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,280
Master,

335
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,880
if you go and ask her,

336
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,119
there will be no misunderstandings.

337
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:35,199
Thanks to your help yesterday.

338
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,400
Today you come and tell me this,

339
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,880
so I really don't know

340
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,520
how to thank you properly.

341
00:20:41,479 --> 00:20:43,199
It's all my duty.

342
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,439
Xueniang,

343
00:20:47,439 --> 00:20:48,680
send Brother Dongrong out for me.

344
00:20:49,439 --> 00:20:50,359
Yes, Mistress.

345
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,119
Mo'er, continue to read.

346
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:46,239
Your son

347
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:48,239
lost my Hualan's betrothal geese.

348
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,439
And you

349
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:53,479
embezzled Mistress Wei's provisions.

350
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:56,439
It is really a mountain upon another mountain.

351
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,199
You can't just accuse me

352
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:02,359
without any proof to defame my innocence.

353
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:04,079
Defame your innocence?

354
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,719
She has no charcoal or tea in her room.

355
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,400
If it weren't for the Master

356
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,520
going over there and getting a chill,

357
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,959
that dumb thing would still hide it for you.

358
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,760
You're trying to force her to die,

359
00:22:16,439 --> 00:22:17,439
and kill the Master's child

360
00:22:17,439 --> 00:22:18,719
in her belly too?

361
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:22,880
I really don't dare to deceive you.

362
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,880
Everything issued

363
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,040
has been recorded in the ledgers.

364
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:28,599
Xueniang.

365
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:29,839
In case the servants weren't considerate,

366
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,079
she's instructed me

367
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:32,640
to supervise the distribution personally.

368
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,560
Since Mistress Wei is with child,

369
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,160
we issued her two extra baskets of charcoal monthly.

370
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,160
Our Mistress even used her own money,

371
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,920
to add 100 grams of cubilose for her every month.

372
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,040
It's her own money

373
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,920
So it wasn't recorded in the ledgers.

374
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,800
But Master and Mistress,

375
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,400
please do not get tricked by the petty-minded .

376
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,719
I…

377
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:51,319
I will go to fetch the ledgers now!

378
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:53,000
So you're saying

379
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
everything has been issued?

380
00:22:54,199 --> 00:22:55,920
I don't dare to deceive you.

381
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,959
What I said is the truth.

382
00:23:00,439 --> 00:23:02,839
Don't get tricked by the petty-minded?

383
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,280
Then it's Mistress Wei who is framing you?

384
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,160
No.

385
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,239
Mistress Wei is the most kind.

386
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:12,319
There

387
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:14,000
might be some slips.

388
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,199
Madam.

389
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:17,479
I have a foolish thought.

390
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,439
You know it's foolish but you want to say it still?

391
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,680
Madam.

392
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,280
Let my mistress explain herself.

393
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:27,800
Explain it.

394
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,000
My Mistress surely distributed the allotments.

395
00:23:31,479 --> 00:23:33,400
But Mistress Wei surely never got to use it.

396
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,800
The items

397
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,800
couldn't just disappear.

398
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,000
They might be located at someone's place.

399
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:52,599
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

400
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:53,880
Here, come on.

401
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,280
Here. Here.

402
00:23:56,439 --> 00:23:58,280
Yes, yes. Pull.

403
00:23:58,319 --> 00:23:58,920
Yes.

404
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,479
Again.

405
00:24:03,199 --> 00:24:04,760
Zhonghuai.

406
00:24:08,719 --> 00:24:10,000
Zhonghuai, where are you?

407
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:12,439
It's dark and we can't see clearly.

408
00:24:12,439 --> 00:24:13,520
We've been fishing for him for a while.

409
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,319
We only found you two.

410
00:24:18,439 --> 00:24:20,079
Zhonghuai.

411
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:21,520
Zhonghuai, where are you?

412
00:24:23,719 --> 00:24:24,680
Zhonghuai!

413
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,319
No need to continue the search.

414
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,479
Hurry.

415
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:44,800
Go.

416
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:56,199
Master.

417
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,160
Master, I've looked into it.

418
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,800
At first the Sheng House wouldn't say it,

419
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,000
I had to use a few coins to make them tell me .

420
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:05,680
There is a thief in their courtyard

421
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,439
and they're searching their courtyards.

422
00:25:08,959 --> 00:25:10,000
I got it. Go now.

423
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:14,160
That's some

424
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,280
great family indeed.

425
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,880
They deducted our stuff

426
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,359
yet they come and search us?

427
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,400
Nothing here.

428
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,479
What are you doing?

429
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:12,359
Sister Xiaodie.

430
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,520
Let me go. Sister Xiaodie.

431
00:26:17,199 --> 00:26:18,199
It was found

432
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:18,800
under her bed.

433
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:19,920
Be still.

434
00:26:21,439 --> 00:26:22,280
Sister Xiaodie.

435
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,000
Sister Xiaodie.

436
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,319
These aren't mine.

437
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:32,760
Not mine.

438
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,839
We really do have a thief in our House.

439
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:44,239
You thief.

440
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,439
You pocketed your own mistress's stuff.

441
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,680
And you said it was my Mistress' mistake!

442
00:26:49,719 --> 00:26:51,439
Thanks to Master and Madam

443
00:26:51,439 --> 00:26:52,319
being so wise and decisive

444
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,719
with skills to investigate,

445
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,760
or else my Mistress Lin

446
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,640
will die from the injustice.

447
00:26:58,959 --> 00:27:00,040
May the Heaven have pity.

448
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,079
Master,

449
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:04,160
I have not failed you.

450
00:27:07,479 --> 00:27:08,680
It can't be Xiaodie.

451
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,160
What are you doing?

452
00:27:17,439 --> 00:27:19,000
I…

453
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,119
opened the side door for her two days ago.

454
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:22,359
I saw her

455
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:23,560
carrying a basket of charcoal out.

456
00:27:24,479 --> 00:27:26,439
You are Master's ink servant.

457
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:28,920
Why would you go and open the door?

458
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,719
He knocked over the ink two days ago,

459
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,439
and was punished.

460
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,560
Father,

461
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,280
I told her to take the smoky charcoal

462
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:44,839
to exchange them for gray charcoal.

463
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,839
Or when you came to our room,

464
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:48,640
we wouldn't have any fire.

465
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,000
Father.

466
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,719
Master.

467
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,439
Good child.

468
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:55,040
You are used to being deceived by her.

469
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,959
She took so much stuff.

470
00:27:57,239 --> 00:27:58,920
How can you know them all?

471
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:01,680
These things…

472
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:04,119
I've never seen these thing before.

473
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:05,479
I really didn't take them.

474
00:28:05,479 --> 00:28:06,479
It's not her.

475
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,520
You stole your master's stuff

476
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,479
and wrongly accused your superior.

477
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,640
You should be dragged out and beaten to death.

478
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,880
She's from my courtyard.

479
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:19,680
Who allows you to speak?

480
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,079
Mistress Wei, save me.

481
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:23,319
It really wasn't me.

482
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,239
Mistress!

483
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,959
Master,

484
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:31,839
Xiaodie

485
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:33,359
has always been loyal to me.

486
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,000
She's very considerate in caring for me.

487
00:28:36,719 --> 00:28:38,280
There must be another story of this.

488
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,680
Madam, you are kind and smart.

489
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,839
You will surely find the truth out.

490
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,839
Master and Madam,

491
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:50,719
please find out the truth.

492
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:54,599
Sister Wei,

493
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:55,760
you are a softy.

494
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,359
She dared to steal

495
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:58,719
from the house today

496
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,359
and blamed it on Madam.

497
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,040
Who knows what she might do

498
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:02,880
to you tomorrow?

499
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:06,040
You'll lose a maiden

500
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,760
doing chores in your room.

501
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,000
Tomorrow I will compensate you with two or three.

502
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:09,959
Nonsense!

503
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:10,719
I have always been loyal

504
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:12,199
to my lady.

505
00:29:12,199 --> 00:29:13,400
You are accusing me wrongly!

506
00:29:13,479 --> 00:29:15,479
Wrongly? Wrongly?

507
00:29:15,479 --> 00:29:16,439
Gag her mouth,

508
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:18,680
so she wouldn't bother the Master and Madam!

509
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,359
Since each one has her own truth,

510
00:29:26,439 --> 00:29:27,199
we can't get to a clear point!

511
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:29,000
Let's report to the Magistrate.

512
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:35,800
Master? It's reasonable to report to the Magistrate.

513
00:29:36,719 --> 00:29:38,640
I am an official. What do you want to report?

514
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:41,199
I have a thief in my house,

515
00:29:41,199 --> 00:29:43,119
yet I should go and sing about my bad luck

516
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:44,800
so the entire neighborhood gets to know?

517
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,760
As they say,

518
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,280
if there's a kitchen in the house,

519
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,680
don't worry about the chef being fat.

520
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:54,640
Yet even the chef

521
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,199
won't dare to eat up all the meats.

522
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,520
I think this incident is quite odd.

523
00:30:00,439 --> 00:30:02,040
If I get to the bottom of it,

524
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,640
there may not be a thief in this house.

525
00:30:06,719 --> 00:30:09,839
There are Yuans staying in this house.

526
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:13,239
And you want the bailiffs to come to search the house?

527
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,920
Tomorrow the entire family

528
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,199
will be too humiliated to see anyone ever again.

529
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,160
May Master come to a decision

530
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,040
after a clear investigation.

531
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,319
This house has never met

532
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:27,400
such disquiet for many years .

533
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,800
Xiaodie's incident

534
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,920
is far from crystal clear.

535
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:33,119
What?

536
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,479
Did you miss items?

537
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,880
Did she have extra items?

538
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:43,520
You were the one who want to stated your bitterness

539
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,680
and said you lacked provisions.

540
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:46,160
Now the stolen goods are all here.

541
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:48,520
You, the bitter Mistress,

542
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,239
wants to blame me now?

543
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:56,000
This courtyard

544
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,680
has such a huge laughable case.

545
00:30:58,239 --> 00:30:59,520
It's all due to you.

546
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:06,479
And you all.

547
00:31:06,479 --> 00:31:08,160
You mismanage the house and this happened.

548
00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:10,479
Master is right to scold me.

549
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:13,040
Laughable?

550
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,040
What is laughable?

551
00:31:15,719 --> 00:31:17,160
This is laughable?

552
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,280
I am the laughable one!

553
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,400
Quiet down.

554
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,199
I am the whole Yangzhou's laughing-stock!

555
00:31:23,199 --> 00:31:24,640
Which big madam

556
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,680
is like me?

557
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,959
Which concubine

558
00:31:27,959 --> 00:31:29,560
acts like that bitch?

559
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,280
This Sheng House, the entire Sheng House

560
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,400
pamper the concubine and disregard the legal wife.

561
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:37,640
It's already been the laughing-stock of Yangzhou City!

562
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,880
Madam, may your anger be dissipated.

563
00:31:42,239 --> 00:31:43,319
Madam.

564
00:31:44,439 --> 00:31:45,760
I admired Master.

565
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:48,319
Master only pitied

566
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:49,680
that I lost my family.

567
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,359
I came to rely on Old Madam's help

568
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:52,640
with nowhere else to go.

569
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Madam.

570
00:31:55,479 --> 00:31:56,880
Your idiot child Changfeng

571
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,520
almost ruined my daughter's life!

572
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,239
You just haphazardly gave him a few strokes of flogging

573
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,400
and thought that was over?

574
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,439
You shrew!

575
00:32:02,439 --> 00:32:04,280
You really are!

576
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:04,959
She almost had

577
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:06,160
Feng'er beaten to death.

578
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:07,239
And you want our son

579
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:08,880
to pay his life for a beast?

580
00:32:12,959 --> 00:32:14,000
Today's incident is…

581
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:16,920
all because of her!

582
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:18,319
It wasn't me.

583
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:20,000
It really wasn't me, Master.

584
00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:21,640
Drag this whore that stole from her mistress

585
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,000
and defamed her superior

586
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,239
out of here and beat her to death,

587
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:26,239
and don't pollute this yard.

588
00:32:26,239 --> 00:32:29,160
Mistress Wei! It wasn't me.

589
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,920
Master. Even though she made a mistake…

590
00:32:36,959 --> 00:32:38,839
Mistress Wei, it really wasn't me!

591
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,959
Though she made a mistake….

592
00:32:42,439 --> 00:32:44,000
Old Madam's illness has just been

593
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,560
cured a few days back,

594
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,280
Eldest Miss just got her engagement,

595
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:50,800
and I'm pregnant.

596
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,599
so killing her is a small matter,

597
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,839
but bringing bad luck to Old Madam

598
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:56,680
and Eldest Miss is a big matter.

599
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,760
It is a virtue to cherish life.

600
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,520
We have celebrations in this house.

601
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,040
May Master,

602
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:05,640
for the sake of the several noble family members,

603
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,839
do not beat her to death.

604
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,119
Just kick her out.

605
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,599
Father. Don't beat her to death.

606
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,760
I am scared.

607
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,079
I said the Yuan family slighted us,

608
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:22,079
but you wouldn't listen.

609
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:24,000
You let them unload the betrothal gifts.

610
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,319
Now the Yuan family is still in this house.

611
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:28,920
The engagement isn't even over.

612
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:31,160
And you want to beat and kill someone

613
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,640
during Hua'er's engagement.

614
00:33:34,439 --> 00:33:36,479
Is there another father like you in the world?

615
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,959
You fear to be laughed at?

616
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:42,199
I am not fearful of being laughed at.

617
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,439
We shall report it!

618
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,520
Hurry up!

619
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,640
Report to whom?

620
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,599
Master, just report it.

621
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,359
Get lost.

622
00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:52,280
Master.

623
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,719
Our Second Brother got beaten!

624
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:57,359
What?

625
00:34:02,439 --> 00:34:03,199
Look.

626
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:04,839
Where?

627
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,800
Master Ming, you're finally here.

628
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,840
Brother Sheng,

629
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,399
what an urgent call by the magistrate.

630
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:30,800
I almost

631
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,439
fell off the carriage.

632
00:34:35,439 --> 00:34:37,479
Master Ming, a grave trouble.

633
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,360
Sir.

634
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,600
Did you find the child?

635
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,760
From Dongjing?

636
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,560
He's the Second Young Master of Marquis Ningyuan.

637
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,280
Go ahead.

638
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,719
His real name is Gu Tingye,

639
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:50,760
but for the convenience of travel,

640
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,320
he changed his name to “Bai Ye”.

641
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,439
If he meets misfortune,

642
00:34:54,439 --> 00:34:56,919
I will never be able to bear that blame!

643
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,520
May everyone please help.

644
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,639
Everyone, please help!

645
00:35:01,439 --> 00:35:02,760
My House

646
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,399
will surely remember this.

647
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,840
I thank everyone.

648
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,040
Thank you!

649
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,840
What did you say?

650
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,360
That is the son of the Marquis' House?

651
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,879
What should we do?

652
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,120
Seal off the city. Move it!

653
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,919
Seal off the city.

654
00:35:18,919 --> 00:35:20,520
Even if you flip Yangzhou upside down,

655
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,520
we must find him!

656
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,719
Hurry!

657
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,479
Never heard of this?

658
00:35:25,479 --> 00:35:27,360
How could this happen?

659
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,560
Sir, follow me

660
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,080
All the alleys by the south gate,

661
00:35:31,399 --> 00:35:33,560
must be searched carefully one by one.

662
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:34,199
Yes.

663
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,000
And here.

664
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,159
We already searched here

665
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:39,159
and found nothing.

666
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,399
Alright. Search it one more time.

667
00:35:40,399 --> 00:35:41,520
Dispatch more men.

668
00:35:42,479 --> 00:35:43,800
Search throughout the south part of the city.

669
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,360
Yes.

670
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,080
Go. Split up.

671
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:47,560
Go.

672
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:49,879
Over here.

673
00:35:49,879 --> 00:35:50,520
Hurry.

674
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:56,760
Managing the house

675
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,120
is a hard thing.

676
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,800
And she's been startled

677
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,120
and got upset and her vital energy is riled.

678
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,919
She needs to recover quietly for a few days

679
00:36:03,919 --> 00:36:05,560
and take some medicine

680
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,639
to restore her energy and it will be alright.

681
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:09,719
I will do as you say.

682
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:12,399
We also have a Wei Mistress

683
00:36:12,439 --> 00:36:13,399
who is pregnant.

684
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:15,800
May you take a look

685
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,080
and we will thank you handsomely.

686
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
OK.

687
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,360
This Mistress Wei.

688
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,840
She was startled today too.

689
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,199
She bled a few days ago.

690
00:36:27,959 --> 00:36:30,120
If there's something wrong,

691
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,280
don't tell her.

692
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,199
Just tell me instead in case

693
00:36:33,919 --> 00:36:36,080
we startle her once more.

694
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,800
She may be overly-upset and it may do no good to the baby.

695
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,639
No one can afford that.

696
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,120
Yes, yes.

697
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,080
Xueniang.

698
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,639
There's no one by Mistress Wei now.

699
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,199
Select a couple of clever ones

700
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:52,159
and send them to her.

701
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,040
I think Zhulou and Lvlou

702
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,800
are pretty good.

703
00:36:55,879 --> 00:36:57,280
Maybe we just send those two?

704
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,840
Then tell them clearly that

705
00:37:01,479 --> 00:37:02,840
they will be serving her

706
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,719
from now on.

707
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:05,840
They can't be indecisive

708
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,239
and they don't need to heed my opinion anymore.

709
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,000
If they are not fully-devoted to Mistress Wei,

710
00:37:10,399 --> 00:37:11,439
then later on

711
00:37:11,439 --> 00:37:13,040
they will have to pay the price for it.

712
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:15,439
Yes, Mistress.

713
00:37:15,439 --> 00:37:16,520
I will remind them.

714
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,760
Sir.

715
00:37:43,399 --> 00:37:44,879
Sir, you needn't worry.

716
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:46,080
Just take a good look

717
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,600
at Mistress Wei.

718
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,280
Look. Have you seen him before?

719
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,879
Have you seen him before?

720
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:17,000
Search thoroughly under the water.

721
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:20,879
Nothing here.

722
00:38:20,879 --> 00:38:22,000
Nothing here either.

723
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,560
Nothing here.

724
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:27,719
Keep searching.

725
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,879
Nothing under the water.

726
00:38:29,879 --> 00:38:30,719
Keep searching.

727
00:38:31,439 --> 00:38:32,399
Do you find him there?

728
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:33,239
Nothing.

729
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,800
You leave now.

730
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:43,800
They are all rough people

731
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,879
who do the laundry.

732
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,040
A child like you

733
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,879
might be abducted by someone.

734
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,320
My mistress told me

735
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,520
to come and give you this.

736
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,560
Why did you bring this to me?

737
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,959
She said you got nothing good

738
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:06,560
serving her,

739
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,719
and instead you suffered,

740
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:09,760
and that you only had an uncle left.

741
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,399
She was afraid that

742
00:39:10,399 --> 00:39:12,479
he might sell you when you got back.

743
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:18,199
Does Mistress Wei trust me?

744
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:20,360
She trusts you.

745
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,840
She said you were implicated because you worked for her.

746
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,600
She told me to give you some money.

747
00:39:30,479 --> 00:39:31,800
It's fine. I don't want anything.

748
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,679
Go back.

749
00:39:32,679 --> 00:39:34,120
It's going to be dark and scary soon, so go now.

750
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,159
No, no.

751
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:35,959
My mistress said I must give it to you

752
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:36,800
or else

753
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,280
I shouldn't come back home.

754
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,479
Your mistress was tricking you.

755
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:42,439
She's the biggest softy.

756
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,919
Go now. Go on!

757
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,800
Tell Mistress Wei when you get back….

758
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:52,760
tell her that

759
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,879
I don't regret having served her.

760
00:39:55,879 --> 00:39:57,320
She said to give it to you.

761
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,479
If I don't,

762
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:01,040
I shouldn't go back then.

763
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Leave now! Go!

764
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,719
Go now!

765
00:40:06,879 --> 00:40:09,080
Sister Xiaodie, I'm going.

766
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,600
You take good care.

767
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,399
Drag him here.

768
00:40:37,439 --> 00:40:38,520
It's him. That's right.

769
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,399
How did he get soaked like this?

770
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:48,919
Hurry now.

771
00:40:48,919 --> 00:40:49,639
Cut his hair off and get our reward.

772
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:50,439
Hurry now.

773
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,600
Look at those chickens and ducks and charcoal.

774
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,120
Mother.

775
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,159
If I hadn't shown my skill before Father,

776
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,919
our room would still be cold.

777
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,800
It's a pity that Sister Xiaodie

778
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,919
can't be with us.

779
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,639
Sister Xiaodie wanted to tell you that

780
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,919
she didn't regret having served you.

781
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:22,399
Will Sister Xiaodie ever come back?

782
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,360
We brought trouble to her.

783
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:32,879
Sixth Sister!

784
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:36,120
Let me do it.

785
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:39,000
You lazy bones.

786
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,800
You can't let Sixth Miss boil the astragalus tea by herself.

787
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:43,239
Sixth Miss, go to play.

788
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:44,360
Let me take care of things here.

789
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:46,439
Go, go. Accompany Sixth Miss to play in the yard.

790
00:41:46,439 --> 00:41:47,399
Go.

791
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,520
Mistress, just instruct me

792
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,800
with your orders.

793
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,399
It was cold and icy

794
00:41:59,399 --> 00:42:01,120
and he floated downstream.

795
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,399
He's got injuries all over his skin.

796
00:42:03,399 --> 00:42:04,360
There's no blood on the wounds

797
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:05,439
and the wound turned inside out.

798
00:42:05,959 --> 00:42:08,760
He must have struggled a while under the water

799
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,520
and suffocated.

800
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:11,840
He was soaked for a long time and he's bloated.

801
00:42:12,399 --> 00:42:13,520
His face is unclear now.

802
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,320
May you not be startled.

803
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:36,800
How can I answer to the Marquis' House?

804
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,600
I…

805
00:42:38,919 --> 00:42:40,840
How do I answer to them?

806
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,120
Great elders of the gentry.

807
00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:31,959
In two days, it's an auspicious day

808
00:43:31,959 --> 00:43:32,919
and we can hold the burial.
