00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Ming Lan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,580
Episode 58

3
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,440
Trust me this once!

4
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,280
Just this time!

5
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,680
I really didn't do anything!

6
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,720
But last night,

7
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,560
we indeed saw a lady

8
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,520
sleeping by your side.

9
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,800
I slept, but I didn't die!

10
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,520
Couldn't I know

11
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,920
whether I've done it or not?

12
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,160
Did you pass out because of being too drunk?

13
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,680
A Guangyun Brothel lady

14
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,920
was sleeping beside Xiao Duan.

15
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,640
Why then none

16
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,520
from Guangyun Brothel

17
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,440
came out to admit it?

18
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,320
Either they are afraid of trouble,

19
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,160
or you really...

20
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,520
I dare swear by the Heaven

21
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,760
and by my mother

22
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,240
that I really went there to sleep by myself.

23
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,640
If I assaulted on her,

24
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,450
then may my Duan Family ancestors

25
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,320
not rest in peace.

26
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,840
I once heard of a swindling ploy like this.

27
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,040
A husband and wife were greedy for money,

28
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,000
so they tricked an unfortunate man

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,040
to sleep with the wife.

30
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,125
And then the husband came out

31
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:52,040
to catch them on the act.

32
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,720
The unfortunate man didn't want to get imprisoned,

33
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,640
hence, he used money to buy his way out of it.

34
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,040
Could it be a ploy like that?

35
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,000
If it's like that,

36
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,525
someone would have come forward

37
00:02:02,525 --> 00:02:03,320
to ask for money already,

38
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,075
and wouldn't have let this matter

39
00:02:04,075 --> 00:02:04,560
reach the local court.

40
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,680
You're right.

41
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,640
I think this matter is fishy.

42
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,480
A building full of people,

43
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,600
but none of them saw Xiao Duan

44
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,520
dragging a decent woman into a room.

45
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,600
While entering the room,

46
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,920
won't they make any sound

47
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,200
or movements inside?

48
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,840
Moreover, if he really raped her,

49
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,640
it already happened last night.

50
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,560
Will that raped girl

51
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,280
accompany him to sleep till morning?

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,920
Yeah.

53
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,080
That's right, Brother Gu!

54
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,280
Then why didn't you say that

55
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,360
while in front of the local magistrate?

56
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,840
If a woman can recognize a blade injury,

57
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,800
what kind of person do you think she is?

58
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,720
If she's not an assassin or a serial killer,

59
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,560
she's an expert fisherman or butcher.

60
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,240
Today,

61
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,120
she was able to contradict

62
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,320
all your reasoning.

63
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,560
Even if we say that, how can it help?

64
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,640
What then?

65
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,720
I'll just let her

66
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,880
accuse me like this?

67
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,040
Since the local magistrate

68
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,160
has released you two,

69
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,840
it means that

70
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,080
he will fully investigate this matter.

71
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,400
Don't be panic first.

72
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,440
Let's look for people to ask around.

73
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,800
A few days ago, Prince Huan even said that

74
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,200
for Brother Shen

75
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,160
is unable to leave the capital

76
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,520
because of the lending business matter,

77
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,075
I would be the one to accompany him

78
00:03:26,075 --> 00:03:26,680
to inspect the salt trade.

79
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,320
But since like this happened,

80
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,320
I am ashamed to face the Prince!

81
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,160
If Brother Duan has also fallen into this mass,

82
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,760
this salt investigation of Prince Huan

83
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,680
is then over.

84
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,720
Brother Duan has already fallen into the mess.

85
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,040
That's right.

86
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,600
Even if his name

87
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,880
is cleared in the end,

88
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,400
he can't get involved with

89
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,080
the salt taxation matter anytime soon.

90
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,360
Anyway, we can still send Old Geng.

91
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,440
"Fighting requires bravery.

92
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,560
The first drum boosts the spirit of soldiers.

93
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,475
But a second drum will weaken it

94
00:04:06,475 --> 00:04:07,480
and a third one will exhaust it."

95
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,040
Even if Old Geng is sent to inspection,

96
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,480
we'll still lose one round.

97
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,000
Ever since we together

98
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,800
entered Bianjing,

99
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,475
how come we all seemed to

100
00:04:16,475 --> 00:04:17,400
be possessed by misfortunes?

101
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,480
How come each one's flaws

102
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,760
could be caught in wrong doings?

103
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,100
Yuzhou is far from

104
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,080
the reach of the Emperor.

105
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,640
You don't have that much wealth in your hands.

106
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,400
It's natural that there were not much spies.

107
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,280
Now, you're holding a high position.

108
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,080
You must always think twice in doing anything.

109
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,120
It's hard to guard against it.

110
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,680
General Xiao Duan

111
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,880
has always been an honest man.

112
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,360
He's even about

113
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,720
to have marriage talks soon,

114
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,160
but ended up getting schemed

115
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,040
by a fish seller.

116
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,440
Could it be useful for us to think about this?

117
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,120
Oh, no!

118
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,800
If that fisherwoman commits suicide,

119
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,880
you all can't defend yourselves

120
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,040
even if you're full of mouth.

121
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,680
Shitou!

122
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,000
Go look for people from the Duan Family

123
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,520
and Geng Family to be witnesses.

124
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,560
Keep watch of that fisherwoman

125
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,360
and don't let anything bad happen to her.

126
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,200
Yes.

127
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,240
Hurry! Go with him!

128
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,080
Yes.

129
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,600
You were

130
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,360
forced to die by them!

131
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,720
Back off! Back off!

132
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,560
He didn't just raped you,

133
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,640
he even forced you to kill yourself!

134
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,720
Official Gu,

135
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,280
stop walking back and forth.

136
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,640
My wife's getting

137
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,640
dizzy with it.

138
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,560
I'm fine.

139
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,760
This one in my womb

140
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,600
should also experience

141
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,920
this kind of stormy waves,

142
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,120
so that when he comes out,

143
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,160
he'll know that this world

144
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,040
isn't as comfortable as being in my womb.

145
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,760
Marquis!

146
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,760
How did it go?

147
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,200
When we arrived there,

148
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,800
the woman is already dead.

149
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,680
How did she die?

150
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,920
She hanged herself.

151
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,240
Her husband and child

152
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,200
were even crying by her side

153
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:16,775
and claims that they will continue

154
00:06:16,775 --> 00:06:17,160
this case till the end.

155
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,120
How long has she been dead?

156
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,800
Brother Xiao Lai touched that woman

157
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,560
the moment

158
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,400
she was brought down.

159
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,040
There was only minimal heat left.

160
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,680
In this weather,

161
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,040
it should take at least 4 hours.

162
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,280
This was done deliberately.

163
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,920
Right.

164
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,550
If the husband really can't endure

165
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,520
the pain of losing his wife,

166
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,480
how could he tolerate watching his wife

167
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,160
hanging there for four hours?

168
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,960
When that woman went home,

169
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,400
she could have just waited to be called for trial.

170
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,360
But to nail us to this case,

171
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,800
she committed suicide.

172
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,350
It shows that the other party has really

173
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,160
invested a lot in this matter.

174
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,160
This matter can't be resolved amicably now.

175
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,640
Good Bianjing.

176
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,800
Good battlefield.

177
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,600
Marquis,

178
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,520
I heard from the servant of Geng Manor

179
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,960
that when General Geng

180
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,960
went home,

181
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,640
his wife caught him.

182
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,640
They had an argument and were still very angry

183
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,000
when we reported to him that

184
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,280
the woman might commit suicide.

185
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,280
General Geng was really mad

186
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,960
and they had an argument again.

187
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,720
He then got bed-ridden and couldn't get up.

188
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,960
Why didn't you say so earlier?

189
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,560
Don't make things hard on him.

190
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,920
Even General Geng

191
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,000
got afraid of this act.

192
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,960
He chose to feign illness and hide in his house.

193
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,400
If he told this while we were in the Shen Manor,

194
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,760
I fear that Big Madam Zhang

195
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,000
would get more anxious.

196
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,880
She's still have one person in her womb.

197
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,000
There were too many problems today.

198
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,760
I'm sure that you must be very anxious right now.

199
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,960
It's a time of so much problems.

200
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,440
What must we do now?

201
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,850
Prince Huan went to inspect

202
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,000
and investigate the salt affair.

203
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,525
It's dangerous for him

204
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,525
to not have any figure supporting him.

205
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,440
Do you want to go?

206
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,000
For them to scheme in such thorough manner,

207
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,680
I fear that it's not just some minor officials

208
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,800
and constables.

209
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,000
The local military camp commander

210
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,000
may not be clean too.

211
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,280
Someone must go re-organizing it.

212
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,320
And there must be someone

213
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,160
who's able to establish order.

214
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,750
A few must be killed to

215
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,960
be offered to the ancestors.

216
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,560
Will His Majesty allow you to go?

217
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,400
Now, Old Shen and Xiao Duan

218
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,200
have criminal cases binding them.

219
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,120
For the remaining Old Geng,

220
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,680
that one in his home is a tigress,

221
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,840
yet she really loves him.

222
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,750
In this matter,

223
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,320
even if she has to act as a wild woman

224
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,399
and escalate it to Wende Palace Hall,

225
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,160
she will never let Old Geng

226
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,560
get involved in this muddled water.

227
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,080
I'm the one left.

228
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,840
Although I've saved

229
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,920
His Majesty and Prince Huan

230
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,840
from the mouth of the tiger before,

231
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,040
without them,

232
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,480
I wouldn't have reached

233
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,720
my status now.

234
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,200
The more, I won't be able to marry you.

235
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,800
"Think about the origin of water while drinking."

236
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,440
I still feel grateful to the government.

237
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,440
I just can't bear to part with you.

238
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,000
When you're around,

239
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,120
I already feel that I'm so far from you.

240
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,440
When I leave,

241
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,440
you'll be farther from me.

242
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,920
You just love to imagine things.

243
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,440
Aren't I just here?

244
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,840
Don't go.

245
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,120
You, heartless,

246
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,080
little woman.

247
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,640
Marquis Husband,

248
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,200
don't tightly hug me like that.

249
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,000
No,

250
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,160
it hurts!

251
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,120
If you don't feel any pain,

252
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,720
how can you remember me?

253
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,600
Jeez, no,

254
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,520
don't hug me like that!

255
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,600
I...

256
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,760
I have.

257
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,880
What do you have?

258
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,920
What else can I have?

259
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,750
Royal physician Zhang has already

260
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,280
come to check me.

261
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,640
That...

262
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,360
You have baby?

263
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,720
You...are now pregnant?

264
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,800
My dearest!

265
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,080
Marquis Husband, it's not yet stable!

266
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,280
Quickly put Big Madam down!

267
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:08,920
Don't hurt her!

268
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,680
My darling!

269
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,120
Marquis! Marquis!

270
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,840
My god!

271
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,920
My dearest!

272
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,440
Here.

273
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,840
Slow down. Slow down.

274
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,600
My shoes.

275
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,360
Here, I'll remove it for you.

276
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,600
Are you alright?

277
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,200
What happened?

278
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,280
I'm fine.

279
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,120
I'm fine.

280
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,720
Are you alright?

281
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,360
I just bumped it a little.

282
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,320
Is your hand fine?

283
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,040
It's fine.

284
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,960
No need to be that careful.

285
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,840
It's good that I didn't hurt you.

286
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,240
I was too impulsive earlier

287
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,240
and got carried away.

288
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,320
Are you hungry?

289
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,200
You don't feel unwell, right?

290
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,880
I'll get you something to eat.

291
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,440
Come. Come.

292
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,320
You sleep well.

293
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,520
Have a good sleep.

294
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,920
I've already eaten.

295
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,080
No need to eat anything anymore.

296
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,680
You must eat.

297
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,200
You must eat more.

298
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,920
Marquis is too happy to the point of being silly.

299
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,240
What's wrong?

300
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,360
I remember Chang'er.

301
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,000
Before, Rong'er would always cry.

302
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,280
She doesn't anymore.

303
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,460
Chang'er got wasted

304
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,360
by his mother.

305
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,960
We must be careful with

306
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,600
this child of ours.

307
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,120
I'm just in the manor.

308
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,360
Nothing will happen to me.

309
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,160
I'll leave you a troop.

310
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,880
I will also find someone

311
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,560
to send a letter to Nanny Chang.

312
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,880
She surely will be here in a few days.

313
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,720
By then,

314
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,080
she'll handle the household affairs

315
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,120
and some miscellaneous matters for you.

316
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,240
If anyone comes

317
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,120
to seek trouble

318
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,200
or bully you,

319
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,880
you mustn't lower yourself to their level.

320
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,880
Or, just pretend to be deaf or mute,

321
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,320
or give them a smile.

322
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,040
Just wait for my return.

323
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,960
I will surely vent your anger back at them.

324
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,000
You are now two people.

325
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,760
You mustn't

326
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,320
make a fuss with those rude people

327
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,600
and hurt yourself.

328
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,560
I'm guessing that

329
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,840
you won't be mad at me again.

330
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,800
When it comes to you, I'm out of methods.

331
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,160
What can I do to you?

332
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,840
Greetings, Your Majesty.

333
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,760
Long live Your Majesty!

334
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,320
Which one is my marquis?

335
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,880
Grandmother,

336
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I think that you just miss me so much,

337
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,520
hence, you especially found a reason

338
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,680
to pull me to come here.

339
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,680
Who cares about a little macaque like you?!

340
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,320
You still won't admit it!

341
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,640
Without you in front of me,

342
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,640
I'm more carefree.

343
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,960
Am I right, Nanny Fang?

344
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,040
Yes!

345
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,280
I don't believe it.

346
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,760
Grandmother, look.

347
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,720
Look at you. You've grown thinner.

348
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,400
It must be because you missed me so much.

349
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,725
"Not seeing for a day

350
00:16:10,725 --> 00:16:11,920
is like three autumns have passed."

351
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,680
You now have lovesickness.

352
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,560
I have lovesickness.

353
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,120
How about this?

354
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,280
Always bring me by your side.

355
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,680
Don't leave me even for a moment.

356
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,440
Let your husband get agitated.

357
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,840
Get agitated!

358
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,200
When Old Madam

359
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,040
sees Sixth Miss,

360
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,000
she turns into a child.

361
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,520
Why are you two even stuck to each other?

362
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,680
Be careful of getting hurt.

363
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,960
Miss,

364
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,800
you're now a Big Madam.

365
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,720
You must be careful.

366
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,160
Xiaotao.

367
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,320
The clothes, food,

368
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,240
even the fragrance cauldron, silver coal,

369
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,040
and the plants in the garden,

370
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,400
you all must be careful about them.

371
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,560
Yes.

372
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,440
Danju, you must remember this.

373
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,240
If you find any servant

374
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,600
to be acting strange,

375
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,240
don't let them off.

376
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,120
Yes.

377
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,680
What Nanny Fang said is so right!

378
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,840
Marquis has left.

379
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,760
The government is also unstable.

380
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,680
You must always be careful.

381
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,040
He is looking out for me.

382
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,760
He even especially fetched the Nanny Chang

383
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,320
who has closely attended to him

384
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,440
from the province to sit in my manor.

385
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,280
That's good.

386
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,880
With you two knowing

387
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,800
how to handle things,

388
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,560
I'm at ease.

389
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,560
I heard that

390
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,440
the eldest sister of your Main Mother, Madam Kang,

391
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,280
is very close to your mother-in-law.

392
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,400
She frequently

393
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,680
comes to ask you to eat with them.

394
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,680
I only go there

395
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,920
every 3 to 5 days.

396
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,920
It's no big deal.

397
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,360
That person isn't good.

398
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,640
Before,

399
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,600
she confused Big Madam to lend

400
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,680
people money with high interest.

401
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,920
Now, your Sister Hualan

402
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,080
and Brother Changbai are both married.

403
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,040
She's always idle,

404
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,600
wouldn't listen to my advice,

405
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,525
and would keep socializing

406
00:18:03,525 --> 00:18:04,600
with that older sister of hers.

407
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,880
I'm sure that no good thing will happen from this.

408
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,100
No need for you to give any

409
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,360
importance to that Kang woman.

410
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,920
No need

411
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,960
to fear offending her.

412
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,320
I must have done something good

413
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,600
in my past life,

414
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,560
that's why,

415
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,800
I met such a good grandmother.

416
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,440
I really didn't know

417
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,200
that their prince manor was like that.

418
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,400
Isn't that right?

419
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,075
I as well as your Sheng daughter-in-law,

420
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:41,040
am here to greet you.

421
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,450
I hope mother-in-law is doing well

422
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,600
and may you have a healthy body.

423
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,880
I'm good. I'm good.

424
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,320
You're pregnant, so there's no need to bow.

425
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,640
Auntie, you're here again.

426
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,160
Hope that you're well too.

427
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,280
You are really a generous mother-in-law.

428
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,280
Only you can endure

429
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,480
having a daughter-in-law

430
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,200
that greets you once every 10 to 15 days.

431
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,600
She's pregnant.

432
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,440
You indeed should rest more.

433
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,680
Look at her complexion.

434
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,480
You can even pinch some water out of it.

435
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,840
You instead have gone frail.

436
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,160
As a mother-in-law,

437
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,440
you really have it hard.

438
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,560
Your elder hasn't told you to sit yet,

439
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,400
why did you sit down already?

440
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,960
I'm thinking that

441
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,400
auntie surely would let me sit down,

442
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,520
so I sat down.

443
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,200
What rule is that?

444
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,000
Is this how

445
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,520
your grandmother taught you?

446
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,760
You've just been married here not long ago

447
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,280
and you've already forgotten how my little sister,

448
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,360
your legitimate mother, disciplined you?

449
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,520
Technically speaking,

450
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,480
my grandmother is also your elder.

451
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,280
What rule is it then for you

452
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,560
to criticize your elder like that?

453
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,920
Since she has climbed up a higher branch,

454
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,720
her manner of speaking has changed too.

455
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,200
She now contradicts her elders.

456
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,000
I've been raised by my grandmother.

457
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,320
As long as I'm alive,

458
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,600
I would never allow anyone

459
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,040
to talk bad about my grandmother like that.

460
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,520
If you think that what I said is wrong,

461
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,240
let's then go

462
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,040
to resolve this matter in front of

463
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,200
your little sister, my legitimate mother.

464
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,600
Disrespectful thing!

465
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,000
Who do you think your backer is?

466
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,320
Kang...

467
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,360
Big Madam,

468
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,880
Nanny Chang is here.

469
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,360
Please go there now.

470
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,520
That is our Second's nurse maid.

471
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,240
She was the one who raised him.

472
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,640
Not that I want to lecture you.

473
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,680
You're being too generous.

474
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,640
A nurse maid

475
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,375
is worthy enough to be seen

476
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,320
by the Big Madam?

477
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,080
You really should intervene in your household affairs!

478
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,840
Why did you change our secret signal?

479
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,720
I almost couldn't react.

480
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,120
What?

481
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,760
Nanny Chang is really here.

482
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,160
Let's move quickly then.

483
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,320
Hey, Big Madam slow down.

484
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,760
No need to rush.

485
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,400
Good! Good!

486
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,525
Big Madam has good complexion

487
00:21:41,525 --> 00:21:43,080
and good pregnancy signs.

488
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,080
I'm sure

489
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,440
it would be an obedient child.

490
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,720
It won't torment people.

491
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,200
Obedient. Obedient.

492
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,760
The doctor said that I'm fine.

493
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,240
No need for you to worry.

494
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,720
Young Master

495
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,950
can be said to have finished

496
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,440
with the bitterness and the sweetness has begun.

497
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,320
He now even has a legitimate child.

498
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,160
Rong'er is also an obedient child.

499
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,080
Earlier,

500
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,480
she even wrote two characters for me.

501
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,600
She said that she can read accounting books now.

502
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,160
All these were thanks to

503
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,080
your meticulous teaching.

504
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,320
She attended the private schooling

505
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,280
in my sister-in-law's Hai Manor.

506
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,000
It's all thanks to

507
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,200
the good teaching of her teacher.

508
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,560
Big Madam, no need to be too humble.

509
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,240
Young Master has already told me everything.

510
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,520
For Young Master to have married you

511
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,160
is worth three reincarnations of great fortune.

512
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,560
When he told me about it,

513
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,240
I immediately came.

514
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,560
Nanny, you're already so old,

515
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,320
yet we still make you worry like this.

516
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,840
So embarrassing.

517
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,040
That Kang comes often

518
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,800
and always asks Big Madam to her company?

519
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,680
She does indeed.

520
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,160
Big Madam is

521
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,360
someone pregnant!

522
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,600
She comes

523
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,120
and they send over Mother Xiang

524
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,320
to get Big Madam.

525
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,920
She comes twice in three days.

526
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,320
Our Big Madam puts it off

527
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,520
again and again.

528
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,040
But she's not at ease to decline every time

529
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,800
and even if she goes,

530
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,000
she gets ridiculed by her.

531
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,320
Quite loathsome.

532
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,400
Miss Danju

533
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,640
is someone experienced by Big Madam.

534
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,675
Do you know about the relationship

535
00:23:14,675 --> 00:23:16,000
between Aunt Kang and the maiden home.

536
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,200
How close they are?

537
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,000
My miss is pitiful.

538
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,840
She lost her birth mother since young.

539
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,080
The Big Madam at home

540
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,440
never raised her for a day.

541
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,520
It was always our Old Madam who raised her.

542
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,800
Old Madam is elderly now.

543
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,720
She only wishes for our miss

544
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,880
to have peace and safety.

545
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,520
If Kang was someone sensible,

546
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,200
she wouldn't ask a pregnant

547
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,240
to toil going back and forth.

548
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,050
Big Madam does suffer

549
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,320
from morning sickness and vomit.

550
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,280
But which pregnant woman

551
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,880
doesn't vomit from morning sickness?

552
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,080
You can't just never go out and meet people.

553
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,475
After you're done vomiting,

554
00:23:59,475 --> 00:24:00,640
you still need to go out.

555
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,960
It's not an outsider that you're meeting.

556
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,920
It's your legitimate maternal aunt.

557
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,520
Since it's my legitimate relative,

558
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,200
I imagine she can be understanding.

559
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,040
I won't go today.

560
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,480
You've already put it off three or five times.

561
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,480
It's not good for you to never go seeing her.

562
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,575
And our family is a grand house

563
00:24:26,575 --> 00:24:27,320
with large enterprise.

564
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,600
This will have others talk idly about us.

565
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,920
Send Mother Xiang out.

566
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,360
Mother Xiang,

567
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,600
I'll escort you out.

568
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,520
Big Madam, since you're not feeling well,

569
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,160
I should stay

570
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,160
and accompany you.

571
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,440
How can I just go?

572
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,600
You were birthed by a father

573
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,400
and not raised by a mother?

574
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,280
Your mother never carried a child?

575
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,080
Your mother

576
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,240
never vomited her life out?

577
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,200
You!

578
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,520
A madam of high society.

579
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,720
A noble conferred lady.

580
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,920
She's even met the emperor's mother.

581
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,520
I...

582
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,920
Is this a place for you old whore

583
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,760
to say this and that?

584
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,200
I came to deliver message

585
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:06,920
for my Big Madam.

586
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,680
Good.

587
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,240
They insist my Madam to go?

588
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,800
She can't go

589
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,960
and this old skin will go see them!

590
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:13,800
You!

591
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,760
Nanny Chang!

592
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,000
Nanny Chang!

593
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,960
Mother Xiang! Mother Xiang!

594
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,274
What are you doing?

595
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,120
Nanny Chang is coarse.

596
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,760
Please don't mind it, Mother Xiang.

597
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,720
Come, come, have some tea.

598
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,440
I won't. I won't.

599
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,600
Come.

600
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,360
Let me go.

601
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,320
I won't have any.

602
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,520
By the way,

603
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,125
I have an illegitimate daughter

604
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:34,760
named Kang Zhao'er.

605
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,080
She's most gentle.

606
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,440
She's had a cup of wine

607
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,560
here before.

608
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,600
I remember.

609
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,920
She looks like a flower.

610
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,800
I saw that she's of age

611
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,080
so I wanted to find a good family for her.

612
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,440
My, it's not easy to find a good family.

613
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,375
The best is to find someone

614
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:54,640
you are familiar to the core.

615
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,360
Especially a family among your relative.

616
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,200
Right?

617
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,040
This must be Aunt Kang.

618
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,360
This is the wet nurse of our second son,

619
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,240
who flaunts her old age.

620
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,800
Nanny Chang,

621
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,560
what are you doing?

622
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,320
I am an old woman who flaunts her old age.

623
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,240
I came to apologize

624
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,160
for my marchioness.

625
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,960
It's actually because she's pregnant

626
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,560
and not at convenience to move around.

627
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,200
I imagine both of you are elders

628
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,440
so you wouldn't lack compassion.

629
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,040
To force her to come meet you.

630
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,800
As if she's the only one

631
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,800
who's ever been pregnant on earth!

632
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,000
Just because she's got merchandise in her belly,

633
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,760
she strikes up a pose and disrespects her elders.

634
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,240
You can be considered an elder?

635
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,360
The sage said, mother be kind and child be filial.

636
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,150
That's for the mother to be kind

637
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,520
in order for the child to be filial.

638
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,200
What are you?

639
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:54,880
You!

640
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,120
We are courteous to you

641
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:56,800
by calling you Big Madam

642
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,440
since you're related to the maiden home.

643
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,920
But you really thought

644
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,200
you were some sort of a dish?

645
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:02,920
Your Kang family

646
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,760
is merely a sister-in-law of the Sheng's.

647
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,080
You're many loops away

648
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,080
from our Gu House.

649
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:08,880
You...

650
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,920
You come here

651
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,280
to charge yourself as elder or what not?

652
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,480
Our family's elder

653
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,440
is sitting right there!

654
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,560
Nanny Chang,

655
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,680
have you gone mad?

656
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,600
Hurry up. Be quiet and go out.

657
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,640
See that?

658
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,920
We have a proper elder.

659
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,520
She's waiting for my Big Madam

660
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,400
to add children to our Gu House.

661
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,480
Now everyone in and out knows

662
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,920
the Madam is with child.

663
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,960
Don't even mention the close friends.

664
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,875
Even the maiden home's legitimate mother

665
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:38,470
and grandmother

666
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,880
don't come to bother her.

667
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,240
To let the marchioness nurse her pregnancy.

668
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,360
But come now?

669
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,160
Here comes

670
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,640
an aunt with a stubborn temper.

671
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,960
Putting up air twice in three days

672
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,920
to charge herself as boss.

673
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:50,920
Jesus!

674
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,920
If something goes wrong with

675
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:53,960
our Marquis's offspring,

676
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,800
can those bones of yours

677
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,480
weighing a couple of taels

678
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,640
pay for it?

679
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,400
You! You!

680
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,491
Are you all dead?

681
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,680
Hurry and drag her out.

682
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,480
In this large manor,

683
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,960
there's no need for dragging.

684
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,160
I'll walk out myself.

685
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,360
What the hell is that?

686
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,280
Did someone in the family die?

687
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,960
No one rushes to a funeral this diligently.

688
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,120
And a miss from Wang House,

689
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,320
the daughter-in-law of Kang?

690
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,720
Not half a look of a lady of a large house.

691
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,720
Don't be mad.

692
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,680
Running here every two out of three days?

693
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,520
I suppose she's here to stir up trouble.

694
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,000
You, you!

695
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,400
You wretched woman!

696
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,760
Come.

697
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,680
Come, drag her out.

698
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,400
Cane her twenty times.

699
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,520
You can't go in.

700
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,480
What the hell are you?

701
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,120
You think this is your Kang House?

702
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,440
Open your eyes and look.

703
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,920
This is our Gu House.

704
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,880
This is my suckling son's yard.

705
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,240
This whole house

706
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,680
is my suckling son's assets.

707
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,040
How's it your turn to charge as boss?

708
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:46,720
You...

709
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,560
Drag her out.

710
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,200
You...

711
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,720
Ask anyone on earth.

712
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,800
Which proper house

713
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,800
can order a pregnant woman,

714
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,160
whose pregnancy isn't even stable

715
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,360
to come back and forth?

716
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,640
But how great is it for her?

717
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,360
She noses her way here!

718
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,200
There's all sorts of shameless acts!

719
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,680
Some pretend to be dumb and dazed.

720
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,640
What?

721
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,920
If the marquis doesn't have an heir,

722
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,480
who will benefit?

723
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,160
Mother, let's continue our chess.

724
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,880
Come, come, Mother.

725
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,720
But outside . . .

726
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,360
Sit.

727
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:17,800
Mother,

728
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,520
didn't Father tell us that

729
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,120
the outside matters weren't our matters.

730
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,360
We play our chess.

731
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,560
Even if you toss and break your calculator,

732
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,000
it won't make a noise.

733
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,280
If you're not willing to live peacefully,

734
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,520
I tell you, you black hearts!

735
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,400
Something unpeaceful

736
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,520
will be waiting for you!

737
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:35,680
You!

738
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,880
That wretched woman.

739
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,520
I will go rip her mouth apart.

740
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,200
Aunt Kang.

741
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:39,920
Come back.

742
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,520
What are you watching?

743
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,520
Help her up.

744
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,240
Rip her mouth for me!

745
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,320
Help her up.

746
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,920
Nanny Chang is elderly and muddled

747
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,840
and threw a crazed tantrum.

748
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:56,960
No one

749
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,360
in the whole manor

750
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,100
doesn't know you're the most

751
00:29:59,100 --> 00:29:59,600
forgiving and kind one.

752
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:00,840
Those slanders,

753
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,560
may you never take to heart.

754
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,800
According to what you say,

755
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,280
if I find fault with it,

756
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,040
I'm not forgiving and kind anymore?

757
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,880
I only beg for Madam Dowager's patience.

758
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,960
Once Marquis is back,

759
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,000
he will surely reprimand and punish severely.

760
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,320
And vent for Madam Dowager.

761
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,760
Now I can't even reprimand her?

762
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,520
Of course she will be reprimanded harshly

763
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,080
once Marquis is back.

764
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,640
May you be assured, Madam Dowager.

765
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,040
Since I was young,

766
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,320
I was never told a harsh word.

767
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,600
Now that I'm old, I have to bear this anger?

768
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,200
She dismisses me

769
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,200
with a petty whore like her?

770
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,960
It seems that

771
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,160
I must do something.

772
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,880
But it's one thing if you succeed.

773
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,240
But if you don't,

774
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,960
your reputation and honor.

775
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,320
That'll all shatter.

776
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,000
What reputation and honor?

777
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,800
That's all hallow.

778
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,480
Furthermore.

779
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,520
My reputation now

780
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,880
isn't so great anyway.

781
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,400
If I continue to live this life,

782
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,320
I can already guess,

783
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,600
in the future,

784
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,480
I will be at Sheng Minglan's disposal.

785
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,560
Eat whatever leftover food she grants me.

786
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,040
Then all this time, my life,

787
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,640
I have lived in vain then.

788
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,920
Hurry and come up to rest a bit please.

789
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,520
It's such a hot day

790
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,000
so allow me to do it for you.

791
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,960
No, no, no...

792
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,440
You've not done this before

793
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,280
so don't add trouble here.

794
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,240
Go and rest there.

795
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,200
But . . .

796
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,960
It's a great relief that

797
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,120
Marquis Gu went on the salt patrol.

798
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,960
I hear

799
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,080
his wife is pregnant.

800
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,700
He's willing to put his delicate wife

801
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,480
and sweet child behind.

802
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,800
And enter the tiger's den. It's not an easy feat.

803
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,120
Marquis Gu

804
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,400
is the most clever calculator.

805
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,320
What do you mean?

806
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,200
Marquis Gu can display his loyalty.

807
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,325
The first day to install

808
00:32:58,325 --> 00:32:59,360
a title for Late Prince Shu,

809
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,040
he offended the Queen Dowager

810
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,320
and received 20 canes as punishment.

811
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,240
Afterwards he stayed home to recuperate

812
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,360
and missed the royal court for many days.

813
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,120
Hence he's lost the chance

814
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,880
to work for you, Your Majesty.

815
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,760
What is this nonsense?

816
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,360
He offended Queen Dowager for my sake.

817
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,400
But

818
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,880
it's to secure himself too.

819
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,400
So he can evade the struggle of the royal court.

820
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,680
And afterwards High General Shen was remonstrated.

821
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,800
General Xiao Duan

822
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,120
has to report to Keifeng Precinct daily too.

823
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,480
Seeing that

824
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,480
each capable man of Your Majesty's

825
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,960
falls off their horse,

826
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,600
without anyone else to choose,

827
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,040
it has to befall on Marquis Gu.

828
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,200
Now, he's willing to put his

829
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,080
delicate wife and sweet child behind

830
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,280
to run the salt patrol in the south for my sake.

831
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,160
Not only is he courageous beyond match.

832
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,920
His maternal side

833
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,680
is a salt merchant family.

834
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,040
To run a salt patrol

835
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,880
is the easiest task for him.

836
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,920
But we never saw him

837
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,960
volunteer on his own

838
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,400
to help ease Your Majesty's weary.

839
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,800
Only after seeing that Your Majesty's wings

840
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,840
are both clipped,

841
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,480
that he troubles himself

842
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,120
to make this trip for Your Majesty.

843
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,680
It's clearly

844
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,120
to seek recognition for his merit.

845
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,240
It's not the case.

846
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,560
Marquis Gu is a coarse chap.

847
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,320
He's never declined in assisting me.

848
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,425
Marquis Gu is someone

849
00:34:30,425 --> 00:34:31,960
who sees the future for the long run.

850
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,320
Back when

851
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,880
we were still struggling to grapple,

852
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,920
he urged you to come to Bianjing at once.

853
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,560
His intention and plan is beyond ordinary.

854
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,920
I hear that Marchioness of his

855
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,520
is a character too.

856
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,680
His wife?

857
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,823
Isn't that the illegitimate

858
00:34:53,823 --> 00:34:54,800
daughter of Sheng Hong?

859
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,825
Her grandfather once placed third

860
00:34:57,825 --> 00:34:58,720
in Hanlin Examination.

861
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,080
And they produced a Sheng Changbai

862
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,000
who is also quite good.

863
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,480
He's considered a talent.

864
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,840
That wife of his

865
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,600
is quite famous.

866
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,840
I hear when she was still a miss,

867
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,480
she had a thing going on with Lord Qi.

868
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,320
At the princess's temperament,

869
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,675
she didn't see her suitable enough

870
00:35:18,675 --> 00:35:19,520
as an illegitimate born,

871
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,880
so she had that relationship cut up quickly.

872
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,040
Which Lord Qi?

873
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,080
That one that spurred himself foremost

874
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,320
against Your Majesty's bestowing of title,

875
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,000
that Young Duke, Qi Heng.

876
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,280
Him?

877
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:35,800
Just that

878
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,240
we from Yuzhou

879
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,360
aren't aware of it.

880
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,880
But later on,

881
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,240
somehow she's reached herself

882
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,440
a high branch like Marquis Gu.

883
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,360
And the family matter

884
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,960
between State Uncle and Duke of Ying.

885
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,240
She's the one who tidied it up nice and clean.

886
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,000
If I were to say something disrespectful,

887
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,480
even our Queen,

888
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,800
might not be able to manage this matter

889
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,160
so clean and tight.

890
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,440
Nonsense.

891
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,200
You dare to speak ill of the Queen?

892
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,120
Your Majesty!

893
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,080
Your Majesty!

894
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,400
I am still young.

895
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,520
I said something nonsensical

896
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,840
and you actually took it to heart?

897
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,760
Gu Tingye can have a wife

898
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,360
as capable as her

899
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,560
and that's his blessing.

900
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,080
It's a pity that

901
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,840
I am foolish.

902
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,400
If I can be like Madam Sheng.

903
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I could help you ease your worries too.

904
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,280
Nowadays,

905
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,360
Prince Huan and Marquis Gu are close.

906
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,720
And they went on the salt patrol together.

907
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,000
And Lord Sheng Changbai

908
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,840
is also Marquis Gu's brother-in-law.

909
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,960
Those three together now,

910
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:48,960
as one alliance.

911
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,160
They can help Prince Huan,

912
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,920
ease Your Majesty's worries.

913
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,200
Three bodies as one alliance.

914
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,160
Those three are talented

915
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,080
and each can have their own position.

916
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,680
For the royal court's flourishing,

917
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,920
and towards Your Majesty's grand prospect.

918
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,760
I hope this Marquis of Ningyuan

919
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,960
can do this nice and obediently.

920
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,200
Greetings to Imperial Consort.

921
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,080
What's in your hands?

922
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,160
Empress Dowager received some silk flowers.

923
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,120
She dispatched me

924
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,320
to have each consort select one.

925
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,520
Her Highness the Queen just selected hers

926
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,160
and I ran into you.

927
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,200
Have you said all you wanted to say?

928
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,360
Report to Empress Dowager

929
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,760
everything went smoothly.

930
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,080
Aunt had us investigate

931
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,280
the old ledgers.

932
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,520
We discovered

933
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,240
an old nanny who does sweeping in the backyard,

934
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,840
her family was originally in farming

935
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,400
around the capital area.

936
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,760
She said,

937
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,225
that year,

938
00:38:09,225 --> 00:38:10,280
he precipitation and wind were all favorable.

939
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,760
She could eat round cakes since she was little.

940
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,425
It was actually past 30 years in age

941
00:38:15,425 --> 00:38:16,720
that disaster befell on her.

942
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,150
And she was sold into the manor

943
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:18,880
with children in tow.

944
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,000
It's true.

945
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,040
It means that

946
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,800
year's grain price being higher than before

947
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,800
is only natural.

948
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,360
But the later years,

949
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,880
since things were in peace and bountiful,

950
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,280
why would the prices paid on ledger

951
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,320
increase each year?

952
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,720
There's something off.

953
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,560
Then what's off,

954
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,720
by you two misses's assessment?

955
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,150
The steward for the exterior affairs

956
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,160
has been on duty for years.

957
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,280
He was very earnest in the beginning.

958
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,400
But later,

959
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,125
after earning the trusts

960
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:45,800
of the people in the yard,

961
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,375
he's spared himself

962
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:48,320
from being too mindful of them.

963
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,725
And he reported falsely

964
00:38:49,725 --> 00:38:50,920
to swindle money for himself.

965
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,160
It's true.

966
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,000
But we ourselves are at fault too.

967
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,120
Though we employed someone experienced,

968
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,800
we should've still checked in often.

969
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,520
Money makes people greedy.

970
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,360
Right.

971
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,200
We ourselves allowed a small crack.

972
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,040
So we can't lament another for delving into it.

973
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:07,880
Look!

974
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,160
Look at these maidens of our home.

975
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,120
How capable!

976
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,800
With that skill,

977
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,360
no matter what changes occur in future,

978
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,680
you can survive it all.

979
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,000
Xiaotao,

980
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,280
hurry and bring me

981
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,120
my accessory box.

982
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,520
Let these two choose to their like.

983
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,400
Alright.

984
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,600
Really?

985
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,360
Thank you, Aunt.

986
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,520
Thank you, Big Madam.

987
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,520
I am so happy!

988
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,040
You are too good to us.

989
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,520
Big Madam,

990
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,720
Kang family's Miss Zhao'er came to greet you.

991
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,080
Maternal cousin,

992
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,360
Zhao'er? By herself?

993
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,320
Yes.

994
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,120
Have her come in.

995
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,240
Look, which one do you like?

996
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,640
Cousin.

997
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,400
Big Madam told me to come apologize to you.

998
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,120
She says she was muddled.

999
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,240
May you not take it to heart.

1000
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,360
Cousin,

1001
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,680
if you are still angry,

1002
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,080
please beat me to vent.

1003
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,360
It's just that

1004
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,240
Nanny Chang's hot-tempered

1005
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,320
and clashed with Aunt.

1006
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,240
It's actually my fault.

1007
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,160
I hope Aunt

1008
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,440
won't be angry.

1009
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,680
Cousin, you really don't fault Big Madam?

1010
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,720
Cousin Zhao'er,

1011
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,080
have some treats and hang out here

1012
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,320
before you go.

1013
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,720
Since you don't fault us anymore,

1014
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,320
may you come to the neighboring yard,

1015
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,560
and have a cup of wine

1016
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,600
from my Big Madam.

1017
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,200
Aunt Kang came again?

1018
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,200
Alright.

1019
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,600
I won't go though.

1020
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,600
You go and enjoy yourself.

1021
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,280
Our yard's been

1022
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,280
remodeled recently.

1023
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,880
You can look around more.

1024
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,400
May you go over.

1025
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,480
Have just a cup of wine.

1026
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,080
Just one.

1027
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,080
Or else,

1028
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,560
I...

1029
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,080
I can't answer to my Big Madam.

1030
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,760
Cousin Miss,

1031
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,080
you can't do that.

1032
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,040
You're tormenting our Big Madam.

1033
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,200
Please get on up.

1034
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,440
Get on up.

1035
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,520
Since Cousin still has a banquet

1036
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,560
to attend at Xuanning Hall,

1037
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,240
I won't keep you for lunch.

1038
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,360
I'll walk you out, Miss Zhao'er.

1039
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,440
Let's go.

1040
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,640
How is this?

1041
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,360
Do you like it?

1042
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,080
Try on.

1043
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,560
This way, Miss.

1044
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,440
You try it.

1045
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,840
This one's pretty.

1046
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,560
What about this one?

1047
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,960
How is it? Did she leave?

1048
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,000
She left.

1049
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:55,840
Madam,

1050
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,000
she cried in our yard quite a while.

1051
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,520
Those who aren't aware

1052
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,120
would think we bullied her.

1053
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:02,920
I know!

1054
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,400
Big Madam,

1055
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,440
yesterday you said

1056
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,760
we'd have milk-sugar dessert for lunch today.

1057
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:17,960
Is it done?

1058
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,480
Rong'er and Xian'er, you two enjoy.

1059
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,040
I'll have a cup of wine next door.

1060
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:24,960
Miss.

1061
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,400
Life of an illegitimate daughter is hard to bear.

1062
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,520
If I don't go,

1063
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,640
she will be beaten and reprimanded harshly

1064
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,800
by that Aunt Kang for sure.

1065
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:34,840
I'll just have a cup of wine.
