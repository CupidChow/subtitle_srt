1
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Ming Lan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,580
Episode 51

3
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,700
Marquis Gu is forcing me to go

4
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,120
while I leaving my son to him!

5
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,920
It's maternal instinct...

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,520
Go away!

7
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,760
Get off!

8
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,425
Marquis Gu is forcing me to go

9
00:01:12,425 --> 00:01:13,640
while I leave my son to him!

10
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,040
What about my maternal instinct?!

11
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,400
He stole my daughter!

12
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,840
Now, he's even coveting for my son!

13
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,720
My god!

14
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,925
We are right under the feet of the emperor!

15
00:01:25,925 --> 00:01:27,280
This is the capital city of Bian!

16
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,680
A newly favored official

17
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,720
is so devoid of conscience!

18
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,840
Devoid of conscience...

19
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,000
You go away!!

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,960
With such a good script,

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,250
you should be a storyteller

22
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,200
in the tiled marketplace!

23
00:01:37,394 --> 00:01:39,394
That's right! Be a storyteller!

24
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,160
In the past, the marquis

25
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,880
drove my older brother away,

26
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,120
and then forcefully kept me in the marquis manor.

27
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,400
He waited for me

28
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,880
to deliver him children,

29
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,240
then he refused to marry me!

30
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,480
It's fine if he wants to kick me out,

31
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,240
I'm accepting my fate.

32
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,960
But, he stole my children away.

33
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,440
Those are my life!

34
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,720
Rong'er! Rong'er!

35
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,840
Stop saying it!

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,560
Leave!

37
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,200
Leave!

38
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,960
Go away!

39
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,680
He's bulling me!

40
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,560
Let her finish! Let her finish!

41
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,720
All of you, disperse!

42
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,510
This is too tragic.

43
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,760
Let me tell you,

44
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,840
it's a lover of the marquis.

45
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,725
He could have easy settled this

46
00:02:17,725 --> 00:02:18,400
with spending a few money.

47
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,025
He's using his power to bully other intolerably.

48
00:02:20,025 --> 00:02:21,000
He's so devoid of conscience!

49
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,280
Rong'er!

50
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,320
Stop saying it! Leave!

51
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,040
While inside that marquis manor,

52
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,120
don't know

53
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,920
how that marquis wife

54
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,680
is tormenting you right now!

55
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,875
Salt, tea, liquor, and iron

56
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,925
were once the highest sources

57
00:02:32,925 --> 00:02:33,915
of income of our government.

58
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,480
But now, the salt taxation is so vague.

59
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,960
The taxes collected are actually under reported

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,320
and hard to clearly investigate.

61
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,700
If the government still doesn't

62
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,880
put any heart to guard against it,

63
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm afraid that our income from it

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,840
will greatly decrease

65
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,040
and a huge problem will arise.

66
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,640
Got it.

67
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,760
I've already accepted your memorial.

68
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,100
Once I've finished verifying

69
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,080
and inquiring about it,

70
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,360
I'll make a decision.

71
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,240
I want to file a complaint

72
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,840
against Deputy Commander of the troop in the palace,

73
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,280
Marquis of Ningyuan Gu Tingye

74
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,700
for having unclean private morals

75
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,450
which is bringing shame to

76
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,200
being a government official,

77
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,040
and tainting the reputation of the new government.

78
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,680
Those messed domestic matters

79
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,240
of your own family

80
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,480
has been known by everyone

81
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,720
in the streets of Bianjing!

82
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,800
It's even more interesting

83
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,760
than the stories beign told in tiled markets!

84
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,825
Do still want any dignity

85
00:03:41,825 --> 00:03:42,440
of a government official?

86
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,000
Do you still even care about my dignity?

87
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,840
Your Majesty,

88
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,600
others don't know about my matter,

89
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,240
but don't you?

90
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,200
The reason

91
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,240
for our first meeting

92
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,550
was exactly because I was swindled

93
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,200
by that evil woman.

94
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,560
She took away my son.

95
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,640
Didn't you even help me

96
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,960
to search for them for a while?

97
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,160
Since I married my wife from the Sheng Family,

98
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,480
I stopped my womanizing ways.

99
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,560
Who knew that

100
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,720
after seeing her beauty,

101
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,440
your past affection reignited

102
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,240
and got swindled again?!

103
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,760
This is not anymore my pre-emperor territory.

104
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,680
There are so many things I have to handle.

105
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,360
You... And you!

106
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,280
You two

107
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,680
are not even sharing my burden.

108
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,725
Always acting like some

109
00:04:30,725 --> 00:04:32,000
idle young men of the capital.

110
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,600
Always coming up

111
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,440
with a pile of problem to present before me!

112
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,600
So preposterous!

113
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,400
Royal Father,

114
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,520
it's not Zhong Huai's fault.

115
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,400
That woman

116
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,760
has even stabbed him.

117
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,160
But considering that

118
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,440
they had children,

119
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,360
he didn't had her tied up

120
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,520
and sent to Kaifeng Precinct Office.

121
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,520
Indeed.

122
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,480
With such a thing happening,

123
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,360
why didn't you drag her

124
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,280
to the local court?

125
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,680
Your Majesty,

126
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,200
she mustn't be dragged to the local court.

127
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,120
If I send her there,

128
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,800
she then would be interrogated

129
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,520
and tried.

130
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,520
This will just escalate the problem.

131
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,840
Not only

132
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,750
is this an old debt

133
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,920
that's so hard to clearly sort out,

134
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,480
since it's a matter about the harem,

135
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,275
Empress Dowager

136
00:05:11,275 --> 00:05:12,680
who is the head of the inner palace

137
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,240
would surely send people to hear the trial.

138
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,480
If that happens,

139
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,560
then it will just bring trouble to Your Majesty.

140
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,725
You are saying it as if you've made

141
00:05:21,725 --> 00:05:22,920
a huge contribution for my sake.

142
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,360
Thanks Your Majesty for appreciating it.

143
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,360
Isn't it just the same now?!

144
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,325
This matter got brought up

145
00:05:28,325 --> 00:05:28,880
in the imperial morning court

146
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,320
and caused such huge embarrassment!

147
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,440
This messy up problem

148
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,525
is clearly a malicious intent to frame people

149
00:05:35,525 --> 00:05:36,320
by that evil woman.

150
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,320
Those scholarly officials

151
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,880
initially won't listen to any explanations.

152
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,750
When I went to the marquis man

153
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,560
or to investigate this matter,

154
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,720
Zhonghuai

155
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,200
just exposed his chest to everyone,

156
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,640
and they stopped meddling.

157
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,080
Right now,

158
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,200
all are just the claims of Officer Qi.

159
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,360
In my opinion,

160
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,160
just drive that woman out of the capital,

161
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,240
and then let Zhonghuai

162
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,520
be to be spared by that relative of his.

163
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,280
This matter

164
00:05:57,917 --> 00:05:59,238
will then just naturally pass.

165
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,040
I've already sent men to expel

166
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,680
that evil woman out of the capital.

167
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,275
As for the matters that will arise after,

168
00:06:13,275 --> 00:06:14,080
I'll take care of it.

169
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,040
Now that Empress Dowager is plotting.

170
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,160
We mustn't let her

171
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,320
has any of our flaws

172
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,560
by now.

173
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,840
How could I not meddle?

174
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,680
I let that evil woman go

175
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,600
so she could go look for Chang'er.

176
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,200
I then can follow the vine to the fruit

177
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
and find my son.

178
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,920
Have you ever thought that this evil woman

179
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,840
is full of lies and sinister schemes.

180
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,840
She just spouts them out when she opens her mouth.

181
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,520
Such malicious heart.

182
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,040
Always scheming against people with every step.

183
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,520
And she's even ruthless and heartless.

184
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,320
Even if you find Chang'er,

185
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,560
with him being with her for 3 to 5 years,

186
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,600
can you really be at ease

187
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,080
to raise him in your house?

188
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,760
Even if,

189
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,280
his birth mother is an evil woman,

190
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,320
I'm the one who took her in as my woman

191
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,240
and she gave birth to my children.

192
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,440
If there's someone at fault, it's me

193
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,960
and not the child.

194
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,120
While we are alive,

195
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,960
we must admit our mistakes,

196
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,231
try to mend our ways,

197
00:07:08,231 --> 00:07:09,800
and make up for them.

198
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,560
Chang'er

199
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,680
is still my flesh and blood.

200
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,160
He surely won't totally be like that evil woman.

201
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,600
If she has really disciplined him in a bad manner,

202
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,720
I also won't tolerate his acts in the future.

203
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,360
But as long as there is a glimmer of home,

204
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,440
I must save my son.

205
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,600
Don't forget to go to the Qi Manor

206
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,800
and say some soft words.

207
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,120
Your two families are relatives after all.

208
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,800
No need to escalate it

209
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
to such an ugly state.

210
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,640
The wordings of the complaint of Young Lord Qi

211
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,480
were actually very intense.

212
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,240
But His Majesty

213
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,600
didn't say anything at all.

214
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,920
I think that woman

215
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,160
also got expelled out of the capital.

216
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,960
Grand Madam,

217
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,800
I'm afraid that this move is now useless.

218
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,120
We and those people from Yangzhou

219
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,960
has just worked in vain.

220
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,280
You're old.

221
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,960
Your information isn't that accurate anymore.

222
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,400
Grand Madam, you knew something?

223
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,960
His Majesty indeed didn't say anything

224
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,760
while in the morning court.

225
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,360
But after the court meeting,

226
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,240
he had him stay

227
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,240
and scolded him inside his private chamber.

228
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,680
Really?

229
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,880
What's precious isn't this news,

230
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,680
but the person who spread the news.

231
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,400
Guess who it is.

232
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,560
How could I know such things?

233
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,480
It must be a trusted aide of yours.

234
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,480
You're the only trusted aide

235
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,240
I have now.

236
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,720
Don't be jealous of such things.

237
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,400
The person who spread the news

238
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,160
is Third Young Master.

239
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,440
Third Young Master?

240
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,840
Third son went for drinks

241
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,400
and bumped into Palace Steward Eunuch Zhu.

242
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,320
A news from Palace Steward Eunuch Zhu...

243
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,480
After hearing it,

244
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,480
Third immediately went to the adjacent manor

245
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,080
and had some drinks with his Second Brother.

246
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,050
Palace Steward Eunuch Zhu who works

247
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,280
by the side of Empress Dowager?

248
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,640
Do you now know

249
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,880
why this information is valuable?

250
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,600
Her Highness

251
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
especially spread the news out.

252
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,440
If you're able to get the help

253
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,000
of Empress Dowager,

254
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,000
this matter will then succeed with less efforts.

255
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Gu Tingye is His Majesty's favored official.

256
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,760
The more he's favored,

257
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,440
the more he becomes an eyesore

258
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,840
of the empress dowager.

259
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,760
Just like this tea.

260
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,800
The more you want its foam to merge

261
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,720
with the surface of the cup,

262
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,480
the more you must have the patience to mix it.

263
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,480
You can't rush,

264
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,440
nor be too slow.

265
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,560
Not only must the tea bread be good,

266
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,120
this tea brush must also help.

267
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,440
Then Young Lord Qi

268
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,200
would keep bringing trouble

269
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,160
to Second Young Master from now on.

270
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,950
Zhonghuai's technique is forging ahead

271
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,440
with the vigor and vitality of the tiger.

272
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,240
It's because your spear is good.

273
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,880
Duke,

274
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,120
I've already drunk a round of tea,

275
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,080
and put off two lanterns.

276
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,680
It's daybreak soon.

277
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,800
Young Lord is still not done with

278
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,360
his official documents?

279
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,040
You really love to joke around.

280
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,280
It's now the third part of the hai hour

281
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,480
and people are just settling down.

282
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,800
Recently, he's getting more appreciation

283
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,400
from the palace,

284
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,475
hence, he is being given a higher amount

285
00:11:26,475 --> 00:11:27,120
of documents to deal with.

286
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,200
Appreciation by the emperor?

287
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,225
Any official work given by the imperial family

288
00:11:34,225 --> 00:11:35,000
mustn't be neglected.

289
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,375
But His Majesty's appreciation

290
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:39,480
for Yuanruo's skills

291
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,840
isn't just a one-day affair.

292
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,360
He might get more documents to read by tomorrow.

293
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,280
This...

294
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,080
How about

295
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,960
I'll go help Yuanruo?

296
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,800
Don't! Don't!

297
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,250
There are a lot of official documents

298
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:53,640
in the study.

299
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,600
I'm afraid that it's not convenient.

300
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,280
Indeed.

301
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,840
Seeing how it's already late,

302
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,400
if I still don't go home,

303
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,560
my family might worry.

304
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,600
How about I'll just come back tomorrow?

305
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,800
Sure! I'll go walk you out then.

306
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,120
Okay, Duke, no need to walk me out.

307
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,960
Please.

308
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,040
Hey, Yuanruo!

309
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,520
Hurry! Hurry! Stop him!

310
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,500
This... is really a bad karma

311
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,800
from the past generation!

312
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,800
Young Lord is indeed reading

313
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,820
official documents here.

314
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,520
I still remember your look

315
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,560
when you were a child.

316
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,960
In a blink of an eye,

317
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,720
you're already attending the morning court

318
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,880
as a scholarly official.

319
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,480
Didn't we study together before

320
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,440
so as to

321
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,520
join the government?

322
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,680
That's right. Too bad,

323
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,200
we're now standing as rivals,

324
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,760
having contradictory discourse.

325
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,725
I just want to expose any misdeeds

326
00:13:25,725 --> 00:13:26,160
in the government.

327
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:27,825
Of course, I must overlook

328
00:13:27,825 --> 00:13:28,360
some private relationship

329
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,440
because of it.

330
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,280
Private relationship?

331
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,440
Which relationship are you talking about?

332
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,400
Which does Marquis Gu think am I referring to?

333
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,520
You're now calling me Marquis Gu?

334
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,880
You came here

335
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,960
for official matters

336
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,000
and not a private one.

337
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,900
Calling you Second Uncle makes me sound like

338
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,200
trying to climb a higher social branch.

339
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,840
Your house is a ducal house

340
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,640
while mine is a marquis house.

341
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,080
How is calling me Se cond Uncle

342
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,240
climbing up a branch?

343
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,840
You are clearly of higher status than me.

344
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,200
I'm unable

345
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,280
to understand you now.

346
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,900
Before, slanderous words against you

347
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,160
are all over the empire.

348
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,925
I instead felt that you were an honest

349
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:20,120
and straightforward person.

350
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,650
You would never try to embellish your actions

351
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:23,000
or be pretentious.

352
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,950
Now, the marquis manor has a good reputation

353
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,160
spreading in the whole empire.

354
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,760
I also can't understand anymore.

355
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,960
Which part?

356
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,040
Everything.

357
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,400
When we were studying together,

358
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,320
I never thought that we will be like this today.

359
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,640
Yuanruo,

360
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,840
no matter how much you hate me,

361
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,920
even if you complain about me until

362
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,880
I lose my nobility title and official position,

363
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,920
Sheng's Sixth Miss

364
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,360
has already married me.

365
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,960
She will eventually

366
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,720
get buried to my family's tomb.

367
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,480
With you doing this,

368
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,200
aren't you just making things difficult for her?

369
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,080
Marquis Gu,

370
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,720
why must you mention your wife?

371
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,280
I filed a complaint against you

372
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,840
for official reasons.

373
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,840
If your actions are upright and aboveboard,

374
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,280
what complaints can I come up with?

375
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,880
The whole Bianjing

376
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,960
know about

377
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,080
my character.

378
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,080
Have you seen anyone filing a complaint against me

379
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,120
because of Manniang's matter?

380
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,240
None.

381
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,400
Yuanruo, you're a very smart man.

382
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,920
Could it be you can't understand

383
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,960
the reason behind that?

384
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,950
To say that you don't have

385
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,040
a personal reason for it,

386
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,040
I don't believe you.

387
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,320
This is your private family matter.

388
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,720
As an outsider, I don't need to know them.

389
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,280
I just know

390
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,200
that the streets and tiled markets

391
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,120
of the whole capital now,

392
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,600
everyone

393
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,320
is taking about

394
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:10,825
how you abandoned a woman

395
00:16:10,825 --> 00:16:11,320
after dallying with her.

396
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,320
His Majesty

397
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,880
also knows very well my matter with Manniang.

398
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,880
That Manniang

399
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,800
is an evil woman that feigns to be pitiful.

400
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,480
If you believe me...

401
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,800
His Majesty really knows about it very well

402
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,120
or he trusts you very much?

403
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,375
You are his subordinate

404
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,120
before he became an emperor.

405
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,840
You escorted him until today.

406
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,880
Rather than trusting you,

407
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,400
you think he would trust a wild woman instead?

408
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,040
Looks like,

409
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,400
you will never believe me anymore.

410
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,320
Second Uncle,

411
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,560
I grew up with you.

412
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,800
I've called you Second Uncle.

413
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,240
I've also told you my feelings,

414
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,240
entrusted you items to deliver.

415
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,720
But now,

416
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,520
look at my ending.

417
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,720
If the emperor trusts you,

418
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,680
what ending will he have?

419
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,200
Yuanruo.

420
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,720
If I was you

421
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,000
and I'm in love with a girl,

422
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,320
I'll immediately seek marriage the next day.

423
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,680
When you were still studying

424
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,600
in the Sheng Family,

425
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,800
you should have sought her hand in marriage.

426
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,960
But you didn't.

427
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,480
You dragged it

428
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,520
until several years passed.

429
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,840
You dragged it

430
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,400
until that princess of the third

431
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:46,960
rank came to you.

432
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,840
You then say that were left with no choice

433
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,850
and you'm afraid that your family

434
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,000
will die in the hands of others.

435
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:54,920
I told you

436
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,000
that if you

437
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,040
really want Sixth Miss Sheng

438
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,920
and wants to marry her,

439
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,600
I'll help you

440
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,760
save your father

441
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,960
and survive that ordeal.

442
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,240
But you didn't agree!

443
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,080
In this world,

444
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,640
not everyone will stand in the same place

445
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,800
waiting for you.

446
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,640
Are you just going to blame everything

447
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,200
on other people?

448
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,800
They've all been blinded by you,

449
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,880
but I won't!

450
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,080
I filed a complaint against you this time,

451
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,520
not for private reasons.

452
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,080
It's all

453
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,920
for the government.

454
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,240
Marquis!

455
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,640
Our people in Shiliang Village sent a letter.

456
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,250
They said that

457
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,800
they've followed Manniang to a tomb.

458
00:18:59,120 --> 00:18:59,800
What?

459
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,560
It can't be.

460
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,280
It can't be.

461
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,880
She must be lying.

462
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,280
She's the best in lying.

463
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,280
Marquis, drink some tea.

464
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,600
Prince Huan...

465
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,040
Prince Huan expelled her out of the capital.

466
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,600
She must have known that it was my idea.

467
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,720
She must be lying to me

468
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,840
and just seeking vengeance.

469
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:37,920
This

470
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,640
is qibaolei tea

471
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,560
I made by myself.

472
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,920
Drink it and you'll feel warmer.

473
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,240
She's a liar.

474
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,240
What evil scheming and plotting have I not seen?

475
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,360
She actually fooled me for 7 to 8 years.

476
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,560
She must be lying to me.

477
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,680
What burning paper money? What tomb?

478
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,360
All are just lies!

479
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,120
Then, why don't we go take a look?

480
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,640
Okay. I'll go.

481
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,640
I'll go by tomorrow.

482
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,480
Don't wait for tomorrow. We'll go now.

483
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,520
Now?

484
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,025
If we ride our horse fast,

485
00:20:23,025 --> 00:20:23,640
I can arrive there by tonight.

486
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,880
It's alright. I'll go with you.

487
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,560
You...

488
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,440
are destined to be unable to enjoy bliss.

489
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,760
Look at your father.

490
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,960
He's now a very high official.

491
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,680
Your sister

492
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,550
has become the precious daughter

493
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,120
of the marquis manor.

494
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,000
While you?

495
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,480
You had an illness.

496
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,375
Just a matter that

497
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,300
can be resolved by taking medicines.

498
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,280
But others didn't die, only you did.

499
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,480
So useless.

500
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,800
So useless.

501
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,120
The second half of my life

502
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,440
just ended in your hands.

503
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,800
That older sister of yours

504
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,680
is a little bitch.

505
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,920
She's enjoying wealth

506
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,280
and splendor in that mansion,

507
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,680
while you were calling her name before you die.

508
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,840
What's for?

509
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:42,775
If you're that capable,

510
00:21:42,775 --> 00:21:43,720
try calling her to come here!

511
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,120
You are also a conscienceless cheap thing.

512
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,560
Leave!

513
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,440
Chang'er isn't dead yet!

514
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,320
You dare to burn paper money to curse him?!

515
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,840
So, this is your plan.

516
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,280
Letting me go

517
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,320
so as to let me guide you to

518
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,880
where my son is.

519
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,920
Can you see that?

520
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,640
That's him.

521
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,720
You still lying to me?!

522
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,200
When I was lying to you,

523
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,680
you totally believed me.

524
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,120
Now that I'm telling the truth,

525
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,400
you just won't believe it.

526
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,280
Gu Tingye,

527
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,240
so what if you've become a marquis?

528
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,280
So what if you've inherited a nobility title?

529
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,480
In my eyes,

530
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,920
you're just a fool.

531
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,920
Shut up!

532
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,600
It's old soil.

533
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,360
Dig.

534
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,640
Dig it out for me.

535
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,760
Young Master, this...

536
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,600
Dig!

537
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,560
Yes! Dig!

538
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,840
Even if you dig it open—

539
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,840
If you still dare say one word,

540
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,920
I'll slap you again!

541
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,680
Shut your mouth, you hear me?!

542
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,240
You can

543
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,080
Never ever

544
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,760
see Rong'er again.

545
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,920
If I see you in Bianjing again,

546
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,480
you won't be able to see the sun!

547
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,680
Shitou!

548
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,040
Here!

549
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,400
Personally escort her.

550
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,360
Look for a remote village

551
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,120
to settle her in.

552
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,920
If she dares walk out of the village by a step,

553
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,525
tell the head of the communal

554
00:25:35,525 --> 00:25:36,280
defense system to handle it.

555
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,200
Yes.

556
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,360
Take her away.

557
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,400
You're devoid of conscience!

558
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,360
You dare to put me in house arrest?

559
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,840
Gu Tingye! Gu Tingye!

560
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,120
Let go of me!

561
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,920
Gu Tingye! Let go of me!

562
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,560
Darling Second! I was wrong!

563
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,880
Darling Second! Darling Second!

564
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,520
Look at auntie.

565
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,320
Okay? Give me a smile.

566
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,640
Let me put this on you.

567
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,840
This...

568
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,640
Come, let me hug you, my little obedient child.

569
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,400
Hurry. Hurry .Put him on my lap.

570
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,760
Let me hug that little naughty child.

571
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,800
With Sixth Little Sister giving such a huge gift.

572
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,320
This child might be so happy.

573
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,920
This is my first nephew.

574
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,000
I'm so happy.

575
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,960
Talking about being a main madam,

576
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,760
it's still our Sixth Miss that's most capable.

577
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:48,750
That matter about that

578
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,720
lowly woman spreading slander on the streets

579
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,320
has really caused a huge ruckus.

580
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,640
But upon turning one's head,

581
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,480
Sixth Son-in-law just entrusted his whole

582
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,480
asset on her.

583
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,680
Although this jade ring is good,

584
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,440
it's no big deal for her.

585
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,760
No one has such an ability among us,

586
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,760
right?

587
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,720
Fourth daughter, am I right?

588
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,120
Mother, you don't know.

589
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,080
That Concubine Chun

590
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,520
in Fourth Sister's harem

591
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,120
wasn't able to preserve her child.

592
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,960
But Fourth Sister

593
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,600
is the most virtuous woman in this world.

594
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,720
How could she watch Fourth Brother-in-law,

595
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,880
a distinguished sixth young lord of a count family

596
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,240
have an empty room and being neglected?

597
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,240
Hence, she successively

598
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,320
got Fourth Brother-in-law 4 to 5 concubines

599
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,720
altogether.

600
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,880
Now,

601
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,240
in this harem of Fourth Sister,

602
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,640
other than Fourth Brother-in-law

603
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,040
and those concubines,

604
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,600
she gets to have the final stay.

605
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,680
As a new bride,

606
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,960
Fourth Sister

607
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,250
actually is showing off a mightier impression

608
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:45,720
than Sixth Sister.

609
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,640
Fifth Brother-in-law is also a man brimming

610
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,920
with emotional expressions.

611
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,880
Too bad,

612
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,120
Fifth Little Sister

613
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,300
usually couldn't even recite

614
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,040
a few lines of a poem.

615
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,960
Don't know

616
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,150
what you two would talk about

617
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:13,960
in your room.

618
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,520
I heard that Eldest Sister's health

619
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,040
is still quite weak lately.

620
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,160
I've brought some gaming meat

621
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,520
from Xiaolu Mountains,

622
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,250
mixed it with some ginseng,

623
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,040
and made it into a soup to give to eldest sister.

624
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,360
It's very nourishing.

625
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,720
The hot springs over there is also not bad.

626
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,240
If we have time,

627
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,480
let's all go there to bath.

628
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,520
It's good for the health.

629
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,040
Sixth Little Sister, I won't go anymore.

630
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,720
Currently,

631
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,000
I'm pregnant.

632
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,600
I'm afraid that it's inconvenient.

633
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,950
It's not yet stabilized,

634
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,440
so it's not good to talk about it.

635
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,040
I know that you're a good child.

636
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,250
We also don't have much relatives here

637
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:53,960
in the capital.

638
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,800
Even if you're now married,

639
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,160
you should still socialize more,

640
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,825
so that you'll have someone

641
00:29:57,825 --> 00:29:58,440
to rely on in the future.

642
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,300
You also should invite your Auntie Kang

643
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,440
to live in your villa for a few days.

644
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,475
She and your mother-in-law, Grand Madam Qin

645
00:30:03,475 --> 00:30:04,720
have always been good friends.

646
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,975
Although Auntie Kang is a good friend

647
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:09,800
of Grand Madam,

648
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,320
I'm afraid that she might not like Xiaolu Mountains.

649
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,275
You still should invite your elder

650
00:30:15,275 --> 00:30:16,560
to join you, right?

651
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,520
Fourth,

652
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,600
you've been sitting here for a long time.

653
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,160
Don't you want to see your father?

654
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,560
Yes. Grandmother is right.

655
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,200
I'll take my leave now.

656
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,680
Fifth Little Sister and Sixth Little Sister,

657
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,120
why don't we all go together?

658
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,840
Ming.

659
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,520
A small banquet is being prepared there.

660
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,200
We all will be going there to eat.

661
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,880
Go look on how the preparations is going.

662
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,680
Okay.

663
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,160
That girl...

664
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,680
Just because she obtained a few blessings,

665
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,880
she had to come back here and brag about it.

666
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,280
That Gu Tingye is also so wild and arrogant.

667
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,375
He would die in the hands of

668
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:53,080
the emperor sooner or later.

669
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,400
Madam, lower down your voice.

670
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,800
Other people might hear you.

671
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,120
What?

672
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,760
You think I'll be scared of him?

673
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,050
Master is currently in the front courtyard

674
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,600
touring the garden with your husband.

675
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,775
If they hear your words,

676
00:32:03,775 --> 00:32:05,320
your husband might feel awkward.

677
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,000
He might vent his anger on you.

678
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,680
Sixth indeed have climbed a high branch now.

679
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,000
Let's see when she'll fall down.

680
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,680
Grandmother, Mother,

681
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,200
I'll also go and help.

682
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,960
That older sister Kang of yours,

683
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,480
I never allowed her to come greet me here.

684
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,520
If you can listen to my advice,

685
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,200
stop seeing her too.

686
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,160
She's still my biological sister.

687
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,960
How could I stop seeing her?

688
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,480
What has she been doing to you,

689
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,080
you should know it very well now.

690
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,240
What mother is saying is so unreasonable.

691
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,950
Even if my sister did anything wrong,

692
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,200
she's still my biological sister.

693
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,600
We are a family.

694
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,600
That Gu Family is a pile of mess.

695
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,520
How old is Ming'er?

696
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,040
She's only a child who just got married.

697
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,700
She also doesn't have a caring elder

698
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,720
by her side guarding her.

699
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,480
She doesn't know everyone's background.

700
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,480
She has to be on guard every day to live her days.

701
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,560
Fearing that one day, she might commit a mistake.

702
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,040
She couldn't even take care of herself anymore.

703
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,000
She hasn't stabilized her footing yet.

704
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,950
Yet this person only knows to play the card of

705
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,000
relatives and bask on other people's glory.

706
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,300
Is a relative like that even worthy

707
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,440
to be called one?

708
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,600
Sixth Sister's house is so peaceful.

709
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,000
Auntie Kang should come

710
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,315
to my house instead.

711
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,325
That mother-in-law of mine

712
00:33:53,325 --> 00:33:55,200
would foil my day every 3 to 5 days.

713
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,160
It's good

714
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,360
to have an elder to scare her.

715
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,320
Ru'er, you've become more sensible.

716
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,680
I'm comforted.

717
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,120
But you're still just a new bride.

718
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,280
Even if that mother-in-law of yours

719
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,920
is wrong,

720
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,680
First,

721
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,480
you must always remember

722
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,320
that she grew up in a poor environment.

723
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,800
Second, your husband

724
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,040
and the scholarly elders

725
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,680
are on your side.

726
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,160
Grandmother is right.

727
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,320
But Grandmother,

728
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,800
you didn't see my mother-in-law's face.

729
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,160
Everyday, before it's even daylight,

730
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,440
she has me stand for rules.

731
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,200
Now I'm pregnant,

732
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,325
and I still have to wait

733
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,520
under the eaves when it's rainy.

734
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,640
I have to wait until my husband pleads for me

735
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,680
before she lets me go.

736
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,440
If we committed any errors

737
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,440
on propriety and rules,

738
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,160
even if we are with full reason,

739
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,440
we have to reduce by three.

740
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,400
But with Ru'er.

741
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,320
Even if we've kept full propriety and courtesy,

742
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,720
and her in-law's still find fault,

743
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,440
then our Sheng house

744
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,720
won't be afraid either.

745
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,960
Yes, we'll all do as you say.

746
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,040
Hualan at least married high up.

747
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,120
But she suffers at her mother-in-law's.

748
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,360
And I struggle to bear the heartache.

749
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,160
But Ru'er's marrying low

750
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,680
and if still has to suffer,

751
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,200
then our Sheng house is a laughing stock.

752
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,080
When it comes to marrying,

753
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,000
naturally, a match with

754
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,560
equal ranked families is best.

755
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,275
We've not committed any fraud

756
00:35:36,275 --> 00:35:37,320
or deception in this marriage.

757
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,400
No one

758
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,240
has to swallow the anger and keep quiet.

759
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,000
I will remember this.

760
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,320
If anything should go amiss,

761
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,160
I will consider it thoroughly.

762
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,760
What I tell you today,

763
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,560
you really must remember.

764
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,280
I have remembered them. I have.

765
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,320
Old Madam. Big Madam.

766
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,520
Sixth Miss sends words.

767
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,880
She says the banquet is set

768
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,800
and food can be served now.

769
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,560
I won't make my old bones struggle.

770
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,160
You guys go.

771
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,160
Yes.

772
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,680
Rest well, Grandmother.

773
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,320
A toast to you, Father-in-law.

774
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,720
Drink.

775
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,320
Father-in-law.

776
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,760
I heard a few days ago,

777
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,850
His Majesty went to pay tribute

778
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:42,560
to Prince Shu again.

779
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,560
Prince Shu is His Majesty's father.

780
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,560
Now that His Majesty is the sovereign master,

781
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,400
he still remembers his origin

782
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,840
and indeed he's filial.

783
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,600
This is just among us family members.

784
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,560
So you needn't be so mindful, Father-in-law.

785
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,520
I'm afraid His Majesty

786
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,640
is once again thinking of Prince Shu's status.

787
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,520
Emperor and subject, father and son.

788
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,560
These are not something

789
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,680
one talk can finish.

790
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,840
Just eat.

791
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,880
My husband's words,

792
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,080
have reminded me of a weary of mine.

793
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,400
You should punish yourself with a drink.

794
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,440
Alright. I will drink.

795
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:30,680
How have I irked your weary?

796
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,480
In a few days,

797
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,320
it's my deceased mother's birthday.

798
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,160
There's a saying that

799
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,840
a day as parents is a hundred days of grace.

800
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,600
May father,

801
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,440
on the account of the past affection,

802
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,840
hold a grand ritual

803
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,280
for my mother.

804
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,800
And bring her tablet

805
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,160
from the farmstead.

806
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,240
To hold it at Yuqing Monastery

807
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,400
so we can burn some incense.

808
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,280
So she's not left homeless.

809
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,040
Shut up.

810
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,880
How dare you mention that again.

811
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,080
Yes.

812
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,760
I shouldn't.

813
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,320
Just that lately,

814
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,120
I keep seeing my mother

815
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,720
crying to me in my dream.

816
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,200
So I feel so uneasy.

817
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,080
I don't know if in the underworld,

818
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,880
she's too cold or she's suffered.

819
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,400
May Big Madam take pity on me.

820
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,960
Let me hold a ritual.

821
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,040
Big Madam, don't worry.

822
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,240
I definitely won't use public fund.

823
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,840
We'll pay for it ourselves

824
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,520
and it's our offer of devotion.

825
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,440
May Father can come to the ritual,

826
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,680
and help me burn an old item to my mother.

827
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,600
Count it as contributing a merit.

828
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,520
Eat.

829
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,760
What merit talk?

830
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,950
Just mentioning it is enough

831
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,280
to dirty up our Sheng gate.

832
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,520
What do you mean, Mother-in-law?

833
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,120
It's just random matters of our family.

834
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,360
Eat. Just eat.

835
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,950
I think next month's eighth day

836
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:33,840
is an auspicious date.

837
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,150
How about you make a trip

838
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,000
to Yuqing Monastery that day?

839
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,880
A minor thing like putting up a tablet.

840
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
It won't take much of your time anyway.

841
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,760
I'm giving a day off that day actually.

842
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,600
Father.

843
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,400
My mother's also at Yuqing Monastery.

844
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,720
They are family.

845
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,480
That's perfect.

846
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,600
She can keep sister-in-law's mother company.

847
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,040
It's better not to accompany her.

848
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:16,840
This.

849
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,640
We're here for a joyful reunion

850
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,040
so why bother talking these?

851
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,960
Let's all just eat first.

852
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,640
Sixth Sister is high ranked and powerful now.

853
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,280
But the family matter

854
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,160
is still up to Father.

855
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,080
Just a pity that

856
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,480
my mother's all alone in the farmstead.

857
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,120
So lonesome.

858
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,280
As her daughter. I...

859
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,480
Alright. Alright.

860
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,720
Mo'er just wants to hold a ritual

861
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,400
to help her mother transcend.

862
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,040
Father.

863
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:14,760
In case her...

864
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,640
Try this fish.

865
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,760
I made it myself.

866
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,800
You've been conferred a title

867
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,880
and things are going your way.

868
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,120
But you don't need to stuff my mouth.

869
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,360
Sixth Sister.

870
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,760
She's married in a lofty house.

871
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,680
But you can't just ignore me,

872
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,840
your older sister.

873
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,480
Can't be that,

874
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,200
you're waiting for me to kneel and beg you?

875
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,440
Fine. I can kneel.

876
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,680
Get up.

877
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,520
Sit.

878
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,960
What older sister kneels

879
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,960
to the younger sister?

880
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,640
Sixth sister-in-law,

881
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,840
this is my wife's private matter.

882
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,800
And it's up to Father-in-law to make the decision.

883
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,640
It's not a bother to you,

884
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,520
so why do you interfere?

885
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,960
She wanted to kneel herself.

886
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,880
I didn't tell her to kneel.

887
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,160
What are you doing?

888
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,480
A family is eating together

889
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,280
and you throw things

890
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,240
and act tyranny?

891
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,920
You're still not the boss of this house.

892
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,360
Since the old days,

893
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,080
no murderer,

894
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,400
is worthy to stand before the victim.

895
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,000
What?

896
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,200
Murder?

897
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,520
You still don't know?

898
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,000
Lin Qinshuang

899
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,400
is the murderer of my mother.

900
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,920
What nonsense is this?

901
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,240
Nonsense!

902
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,040
It's true.

903
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,920
Fourth Sister, unless I'm dead,

904
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,200
you can forget about

905
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,720
ever bringing Lin Qinshuang's tablet

906
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,800
to place at Yuqing Monastery.

907
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,040
Such nonsense!

908
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,160
Qinshuang

909
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,160
had such a tender soul.

910
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:06,800
How could she

911
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,960
caused your mother's death?

912
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,920
Everyone in the family

913
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,560
knows your mother died of dystocia.

914
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,640
How is this possible?

915
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,560
You dare to slander my mother?

916
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,960
I have witness and testimony.

917
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,120
If you don't believe me,

918
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,520
we can go to Keifeng Precinct.

919
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,160
Are you trying to ruin our family's reputation?

920
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,400
All the servants go out.

921
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,800
And you two.

922
00:43:58,920 --> 00:43:59,800
It's fine.
