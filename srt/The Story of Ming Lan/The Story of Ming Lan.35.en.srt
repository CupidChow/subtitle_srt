00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,873
Episode 35

3
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:10,780
Your hands are also

4
00:01:11,725 --> 00:01:13,100
tainted with my little sister's blood.

5
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,100
You choose how to be killed.

6
00:01:42,825 --> 00:01:44,250
It's snowing.

7
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,100
Such a huge snowfall.

8
00:01:55,475 --> 00:01:56,975
She's crazy.

9
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,225
Such a huge snowfall.

10
00:01:58,225 --> 00:01:59,675
She might just be pretending.

11
00:02:00,325 --> 00:02:03,000
Your Majesty,

12
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:11,000
it's snowing!

13
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,125
It's snowing...it's snowing!

14
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,125
Throw her out onto the street!

15
00:02:24,525 --> 00:02:25,925
Let her crazily shout there.

16
00:02:26,525 --> 00:02:28,675
Have everyone to see her,

17
00:02:28,675 --> 00:02:29,325
so she'll get pointed at, spat at,

18
00:02:29,325 --> 00:02:29,775
and cursed at by them!

19
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,350
Let her experience

20
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:37,150
what my little sister endured before.

21
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,100
It's snowing!

22
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,050
Your Highness!

23
00:02:48,675 --> 00:02:50,200
It's snowing!

24
00:02:53,175 --> 00:02:54,000
Let's go.

25
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:57,825
Hurry.

26
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,075
Crawl out of here and then

27
00:03:03,075 --> 00:03:04,100
just keep running toward the west.

28
00:03:04,425 --> 00:03:05,425
Luckily this place is not that far from

29
00:03:05,425 --> 00:03:06,775
the area outside the Imperial city.

30
00:03:06,775 --> 00:03:07,305
Just walk a few hundred steps,

31
00:03:07,305 --> 00:03:08,100
and it will be the Xihua Gates.

32
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:08,850
Remember,

33
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:09,575
don't go out

34
00:03:09,575 --> 00:03:11,025
through the main gates,

35
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:12,175
take the narrow path on its north side.

36
00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:13,025
The wall there

37
00:03:13,025 --> 00:03:14,100
also has a dog hole like this.

38
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,025
There are grasses covering it,

39
00:03:15,025 --> 00:03:16,325
so only a few people know about it.

40
00:03:16,325 --> 00:03:17,500
If you go out from there,

41
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,275
you'll preserve your life.

42
00:03:18,675 --> 00:03:20,100
Official, what's your name?

43
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,025
My name is Qingyun.

44
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,400
Official Qingyun,

45
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,800
leave with me.

46
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,150
I've worked in the palace since I was little.

47
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:26,875
I won't know how to survive

48
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,125
even if I go out.

49
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:28,875
If I'm afraid,

50
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,375
I'll just look for a place to hide.

51
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,200
Miss Sheng, quickly go.

52
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,675
If I'm able to survive,

53
00:03:33,675 --> 00:03:35,150
I won't forget this great favor.

54
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,050
Quickly go.

55
00:03:53,925 --> 00:03:55,200
If I knew today would happen,

56
00:03:55,525 --> 00:03:58,300
I could have him deposed beforehand!

57
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:58,900
Your Majesty.

58
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,575
I...

59
00:03:59,575 --> 00:04:00,397
Your Majesty.

60
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,300
There's no point cursing now.

61
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:04,150
What's important is to

62
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,750
look for people to save you.

63
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,250
Yuzhou's Zhao Zongquan

64
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,600
is nearest to the capital.

65
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,000
One, two, three! One, two, three!

66
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,725
Your Majesty, you're conferring Zhao Zongquan

67
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:53,825
as Crown Prince?

68
00:04:54,725 --> 00:04:56,375
Among the Imperial clan,

69
00:04:56,725 --> 00:04:58,150
although Zhao Zongquan is the most mediocre,

70
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,025
he is benevolent and righteous.

71
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,950
He's the only choice.

72
00:05:07,025 --> 00:05:08,525
The Imperial court officials

73
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,750
kept arguing about the Crown Prince matter.

74
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,025
Who would have guessed that

75
00:05:13,025 --> 00:05:14,475
conferment of the heir

76
00:05:14,725 --> 00:05:16,550
would be done with a knife placed at your neck.

77
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,975
This is fate.

78
00:05:20,525 --> 00:05:22,125
You...

79
00:05:22,525 --> 00:05:24,100
Come up with a way to hand both this military seal

80
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,150
and this decree to Zhao Zongquan.

81
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,400
The Imperial city

82
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,875
has already been surrounded by the rebel army.

83
00:05:32,325 --> 00:05:33,485
Nobody is able to go out of the palace

84
00:05:33,485 --> 00:05:34,225
and deliver this letter!

85
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,500
Who will go?

86
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,750
His Majesty

87
00:05:52,975 --> 00:05:55,400
was usually too lenient with all of you.

88
00:05:55,975 --> 00:05:57,350
He didn't scold or hit you.

89
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:58,650
He even defended you

90
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,150
when you had committed mistakes.

91
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:03,625
Now, it's time for you to pay back his kindness,

92
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,100
yet you all are retreating and won't come forward.

93
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,150
In this huge Imperial city,

94
00:06:09,825 --> 00:06:12,150
is there no loyal and righteous person?

95
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,450
I'm willing to deliver the decree.

96
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,400
Who's talking?

97
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,875
I'm willing to deliver the Imperial decree.

98
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,350
How old are you?

99
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,900
Thirteen.

100
00:06:36,925 --> 00:06:38,475
With such a young age

101
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,475
and a weak build,

102
00:06:40,825 --> 00:06:42,600
how can you charge out of the

103
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,900
enclosure of the rebel army?

104
00:06:44,525 --> 00:06:45,875
I know the small alleys in the palace.

105
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,700
His Majesty doesn't like extravagance,

106
00:06:49,525 --> 00:06:50,393
so there are palace walls that

107
00:06:50,393 --> 00:06:51,150
haven't been repaired for a long time.

108
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:52,941
Some dogs have created holes

109
00:06:52,941 --> 00:06:54,025
for them in a lot of walls.

110
00:06:54,575 --> 00:06:55,800
My build is small,

111
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,100
so I'll be able to crawl out of these dog holes.

112
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,375
Raise your head up.

113
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,825
Are you not afraid?

114
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,100
When I initially entered the palace,

115
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,000
the Tea Brewing Eunuch asked me to

116
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,875
deliver tea to His Majesty.

117
00:07:13,775 --> 00:07:14,861
One day, when I was on duty

118
00:07:14,861 --> 00:07:15,875
to attend to His Majesty,

119
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,124
I forgot to ground the tea leaves

120
00:07:17,124 --> 00:07:18,075
but didn't get discovered.

121
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,575
I thought that I was just fortunate.

122
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,475
Afterwards, I learned that

123
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,975
His Majesty was actually very thirsty that day.

124
00:07:24,275 --> 00:07:26,000
However, he saw that I wasn't

125
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,325
carrying any tea with me,

126
00:07:27,475 --> 00:07:28,325
and just endured his thirst

127
00:07:28,325 --> 00:07:29,350
and didn't say anything throughout.

128
00:07:29,775 --> 00:07:31,650
Upon reaching his chamber palace,

129
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,100
he drank all the tea

130
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,150
of Her Highness.

131
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,550
I've received great grace from His Majesty

132
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:37,950
and was able to escape punishment.

133
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,750
Now, I'm willing to risk my life to repay him.

134
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:41,975
It's because I saw how young you were,

135
00:07:42,025 --> 00:07:43,425
and couldn't bear for you to get punished.

136
00:07:43,725 --> 00:07:44,800
You shouldn't have remembered

137
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,975
such a trifling matter for this long.

138
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,825
For Your Majesty, it's just a trifling matter,

139
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,500
but for me, it's a major favor.

140
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,200
Just one word from Your Majesty,

141
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,625
and my life was saved.

142
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:54,750
I'm willing to resolve

143
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,025
your urgent need.

144
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,300
Okay. Okay.

145
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,600
Lift your head up.

146
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,825
You know how to repay the good deeds done to you.

147
00:08:01,275 --> 00:08:03,075
If you're able to deliver this letter out,

148
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,557
you will earn the top meritorious deed

149
00:08:05,557 --> 00:08:07,000
in rescuing His Majesty!

150
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,575
I'm entrusting everything to you.

151
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,875
Attendant!

152
00:08:14,425 --> 00:08:16,025
Walk her out through the back door.

153
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:43,875
Move aside.

154
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:45,975
How dare you!

155
00:08:47,825 --> 00:08:49,600
I'm the Empress of our dynasty.

156
00:08:50,075 --> 00:08:52,075
How could you order me around?

157
00:08:57,525 --> 00:08:58,850
Disperse!

158
00:09:04,825 --> 00:09:06,975
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

159
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,825
No! Your Majesty...

160
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,700
Your Majesty!

161
00:10:16,775 --> 00:10:18,475
Who are you?

162
00:10:18,475 --> 00:10:20,075
I...am a palace maid of Funing Palace.

163
00:10:20,075 --> 00:10:21,500
Little official, please pull me out.

164
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,650
Her Highness the Empress asked me to

165
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,350
take a message out to save His Majesty.

166
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,925
You're delivering a message to save His Majesty?

167
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,250
They're about to catch up.

168
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,000
Don't mind that anymore. Let's quickly escape.

169
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,850
General!

170
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:37,525
General...

171
00:10:39,225 --> 00:10:40,275
Say it!

172
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,925
There's a little palace maid

173
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:43,700
who took with her

174
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,100
His Majesty's blood-written decree

175
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,250
How does she look? How old?

176
00:10:47,325 --> 00:10:48,625
Which direction did she go?

177
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:49,875
Around thirteen or fourteen,

178
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,100
very thin,

179
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,250
and went towards the Xihua Gates.

180
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,075
Quickly send people to go after her.

181
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:07,350
You know the streets here in Bianjing?

182
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,675
A little.

183
00:11:09,925 --> 00:11:11,200
The heavens are really helping me.

184
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,275
May I ask you to lead the way

185
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,550
and help me out of the city.

186
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,875
I have to go to Yuzhou.

187
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,350
Why are you going

188
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,375
to such a far place?

189
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,919
Find Yuzhou's militia commander

190
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:20,900
Zhao Zongquan to save His Majesty!

191
00:11:21,575 --> 00:11:23,100
Well, I...

192
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,896
I only know some of the streets here

193
00:11:24,896 --> 00:11:25,700
in the capital.

194
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,875
I don't know

195
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,975
how to go to Yuzhou.

196
00:11:29,975 --> 00:11:32,300
How about I bring you home?

197
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,275
I have carriages in our house.

198
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,850
I'll be able to have you sent to Yuzhou.

199
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,750
Move aside! Move aside!

200
00:11:39,525 --> 00:11:41,150
You...live in Bianjing?

201
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,375
You even have carriages in your house?

202
00:11:43,775 --> 00:11:45,301
Then...why did you enter the palace

203
00:11:45,301 --> 00:11:46,200
and became a eunuch?

204
00:11:46,675 --> 00:11:48,225
Don't be afraid.

205
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,525
I'm a daughter of an official.

206
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:51,325
I went to the palace today

207
00:11:51,325 --> 00:11:52,200
to deliver food to my father and brother.

208
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,250
However, I encountered this kind of disaster.

209
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,300
I had to change clothes before escaping out.

210
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,125
What's wrong?

211
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:58,950
When I usually go out,

212
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:01,075
either I ride a carriage or a palaquin.

213
00:12:01,075 --> 00:12:02,650
I'm a little lost.

214
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,650
What now?

215
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:05,725
There they are!

216
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,945
Catch her!

217
00:12:11,575 --> 00:12:12,850
Move aside!

218
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,850
Move aside!

219
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,325
After them!

220
00:12:35,475 --> 00:12:36,450
What are you doing?

221
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,500
Please let us pass! Let us pass!

222
00:12:39,775 --> 00:12:40,875
Get away!

223
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:42,700
Let's separate to look for them.

224
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,075
Excuse us! Please let us pass!

225
00:12:53,725 --> 00:12:54,675
This...

226
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:56,625
I'm dying.

227
00:12:58,825 --> 00:13:00,500
You...you,

228
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:01,775
quickly get up.

229
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,825
I fear that I won't be able to go anymore.

230
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,750
This is His Majesty's personally written decree.

231
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,250
I can only entrust it to you.

232
00:13:18,925 --> 00:13:22,095
This...is the military seal.

233
00:13:23,675 --> 00:13:25,150
You can read?

234
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,225
That's great.

235
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,300
When you find Yuzhou's Militia Commander,

236
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,350
ask him to use the military seal

237
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,000
and come to His Majesty's aid.

238
00:13:40,925 --> 00:13:42,400
They're not here.

239
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,750
Did you see

240
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,050
a eunuch and a palace maid?

241
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:46,975
Upstairs.

242
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:48,675
Quickly go after them!

243
00:13:49,175 --> 00:13:50,575
Hurry and leave!

244
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,175
Hurry and leave!

245
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:53,450
I will slow them a little.

246
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:54,400
Quickly leave!

247
00:13:55,325 --> 00:13:56,400
I beg you!

248
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:57,825
Save him!

249
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,100
He's really

250
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,350
a good Emperor!

251
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,825
I beg you!

252
00:14:02,725 --> 00:14:03,350
Quickly go...

253
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,175
Move aside!

254
00:14:27,425 --> 00:14:29,450
Go!

255
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,625
Don't run!

256
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:45,450
Hurry! Hurry and chase her!

257
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,350
Quickly go after her! Hurry!

258
00:14:50,075 --> 00:14:51,025
Quickly go after her!

259
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,150
My horse carriage!

260
00:15:02,025 --> 00:15:03,650
Move aside!

261
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,350
After her!

262
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,825
Chase her!

263
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,475
It's actually a lady.

264
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,475
You can run fast.

265
00:16:35,925 --> 00:16:37,725
Don't come near! Don't come near!

266
00:16:39,525 --> 00:16:41,400
This lady really has guts!

267
00:16:41,825 --> 00:16:42,875
Don't come near me!

268
00:16:43,175 --> 00:16:44,375
We are under military order.

269
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:45,800
How about we take her back

270
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,700
and have some fun with her?

271
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,425
Don't come near me! Help! Help!

272
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,075
Help!

273
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,850
What the hell!

274
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:25,500
Help! Help!

275
00:17:29,775 --> 00:17:33,250
You scratched my face and ruined it.

276
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,875
Everyone, don't move first!

277
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,050
With just those few people,

278
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:55,635
he can kill them barehanded.

279
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,200
Let's just give him the chance.

280
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,525
We only need to

281
00:17:59,525 --> 00:18:00,800
guard by my father's side.

282
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:15,350
Idiot!

283
00:18:16,325 --> 00:18:19,300
This way! This way!

284
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,400
Stop running.

285
00:18:56,825 --> 00:18:58,400
Second Uncle.

286
00:18:58,450 --> 00:18:59,925
Second Uncle Gu...

287
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:02,500
Don't be afraid.

288
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,175
Second Uncle!

289
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:04,250
They're all dead.

290
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:11,225
Why are you here?

291
00:19:11,225 --> 00:19:12,600
I'm going to Bianjing.

292
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,550
I'm going to Yuzhou.

293
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,825
Why are you going there?

294
00:19:16,825 --> 00:19:17,950
I...I am going to

295
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:19,900
look for Zhao Zongquan.

296
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,700
I'm going to hand him the military seal and...

297
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,300
the blood-written decree.

298
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:27,425
Quickly take him to look for him.

299
00:19:28,525 --> 00:19:30,750
What military seal? What blood-written decree?

300
00:19:33,775 --> 00:19:36,000
You...have a horse.

301
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,975
I have no time to explain.

302
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:37,800
Quickly take me there.

303
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,200
Stop! He's just over there.

304
00:19:41,275 --> 00:19:42,300
Over there.

305
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:44,250
Zhao Zongquan.

306
00:19:50,675 --> 00:19:52,075
Officer!

307
00:20:07,525 --> 00:20:09,625
Is that indeed His Majesty's handwriting?

308
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,675
Right.

309
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,925
Although he wrote it with his finger,

310
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,500
this robe fabric must be his.

311
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,500
Since that's the case,

312
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,575
Father is now the Crown Prince

313
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,150
conferred by His Majesty.

314
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,850
Don't!

315
00:20:29,825 --> 00:20:31,550
Quickly get up.Don't bow to me!

316
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:34,850
This is a good thing.

317
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,425
Your Highness, there's no need to panic.

318
00:20:36,775 --> 00:20:38,800
What do you mean, 'Your Highness'? What "Highness"!

319
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,500
Don't even mention those two words.

320
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,600
I'm panicking!

321
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,000
Don't talk about some "crown prince" now!

322
00:20:45,225 --> 00:20:46,325
Quickly go save the Emperor!

323
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:47,512
With just a few of us,

324
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:48,575
how are we going to save His Majesty?

325
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,025
We must take the Imperial decree

326
00:20:51,325 --> 00:20:52,850
and mobilize the army

327
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,250
under the command of the Crown Prince.

328
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,575
Lord, stop delaying!

329
00:20:57,225 --> 00:20:58,000
If we delay it any longer,

330
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,300
I fear that His Majesty might be dead by then!

331
00:20:59,300 --> 00:20:59,662
When the father dies,

332
00:20:59,662 --> 00:21:00,211
the son ascends to the throne!

333
00:21:00,211 --> 00:21:00,700
That's just right and proper!

334
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,425
As an Imperial relative,

335
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:05,753
being entrusted with such a mission

336
00:21:05,753 --> 00:21:06,225
during this dangerous time

337
00:21:06,225 --> 00:21:07,350
and forcing myself to ascend to the position

338
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,625
will surely cause myself future trouble!

339
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,875
Father, how could you say such words?

340
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,075
The current Emperor has no sons!

341
00:21:19,425 --> 00:21:20,775
Now, he even made a decree.

342
00:21:20,775 --> 00:21:21,348
Everything is being done

343
00:21:21,348 --> 00:21:22,000
and perfectly justifiable!

344
00:21:22,325 --> 00:21:23,550
How could there be future troubles?

345
00:21:23,975 --> 00:21:25,325
Have you

346
00:21:25,525 --> 00:21:26,550
forgotten the ancestors

347
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,950
of Zhao clan killing each other?

348
00:21:33,175 --> 00:21:34,725
If in the end,

349
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:36,900
brothers will be fighting,

350
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:37,709
father and sons will

351
00:21:37,709 --> 00:21:38,275
turn hostile to each other,

352
00:21:38,525 --> 00:21:39,600
there's no point

353
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,950
in becoming crown prince.

354
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,200
I'm already satisfied

355
00:21:44,475 --> 00:21:45,200
to live my life

356
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,075
in peace.

357
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,350
Please just spare me this.

358
00:21:58,255 --> 00:21:58,976
Lord,

359
00:22:00,493 --> 00:22:01,587
the reason that Prince Yan wanted to assassinate

360
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:02,042
the person carrying

361
00:22:02,042 --> 00:22:02,830
the blood-written Imperial decree

362
00:22:03,253 --> 00:22:04,993
must be because he knows what's written on it.

363
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:06,186
Do you think

364
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,001
he'll let us go back to Yuzhou

365
00:22:08,001 --> 00:22:08,896
and live our days in peace?

366
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:11,407
Just one entrusted Imperial decree

367
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,197
has already invited

368
00:22:13,197 --> 00:22:14,191
so many assassins.

369
00:22:14,788 --> 00:22:16,280
Once Prince Yan learns that

370
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:16,788
His Majesty has intentions

371
00:22:16,788 --> 00:22:17,374
of passing the throne to you,

372
00:22:17,647 --> 00:22:18,003
no matter if he chases you

373
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:18,368
to the end of the world,

374
00:22:18,692 --> 00:22:20,382
he will cut the weeds and dig up the roots!

375
00:22:22,495 --> 00:22:24,410
Prince Yan is so ruthless.

376
00:22:25,031 --> 00:22:25,759
He's even able to do such a thing

377
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:26,498
as forcing the Emperor to abdicate.

378
00:22:26,498 --> 00:22:27,120
Do you think

379
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,233
he will let your whole family go?

380
00:22:30,824 --> 00:22:31,321
This...

381
00:22:33,111 --> 00:22:33,932
Now,

382
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:36,020
your life is temporarily preserved,

383
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,332
but the officials of Yuzhou

384
00:22:38,332 --> 00:22:39,401
will soon lose theirs!

385
00:22:39,724 --> 00:22:42,782
Lord, please immediately decide!

386
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:47,059
Father, let's not talk about

387
00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:47,905
our lives first.

388
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,509
We still have our wives and children in Yuzhou,

389
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:53,274
that's several lives.

390
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:56,531
My daughter is just

391
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:58,445
two years old.

392
00:22:59,464 --> 00:23:01,777
If Father refuses to accept this Imperial decree,

393
00:23:03,094 --> 00:23:04,213
then those several lives

394
00:23:04,213 --> 00:23:05,655
in our family

395
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,365
will be gone.

396
00:23:10,801 --> 00:23:13,362
Father, I beg you to save me.

397
00:23:13,984 --> 00:23:15,450
Save our whole family.

398
00:23:20,174 --> 00:23:21,343
Lord,

399
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,934
while Prince Yan

400
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:24,003
still has no free hand to spare,

401
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:25,842
we can knock him cold

402
00:23:25,867 --> 00:23:27,135
and battle it out with him.

403
00:23:27,334 --> 00:23:28,453
If we delay it any further,

404
00:23:28,801 --> 00:23:30,417
until Prince Yan forced His Majesty

405
00:23:30,417 --> 00:23:31,362
to amend the decree,

406
00:23:31,362 --> 00:23:32,506
we will never

407
00:23:33,003 --> 00:23:34,096
be able to

408
00:23:34,096 --> 00:23:35,887
resist him.

409
00:23:35,887 --> 00:23:36,757
Lord!

410
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:44,165
Didn't you already address me as 'Your Highness'?

411
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,024
Why are you still calling me "Lord'?

412
00:23:52,295 --> 00:23:53,662
May Your Highness give your orders!

413
00:23:54,383 --> 00:23:55,627
Go change clothes.

414
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,063
Take the blood-written decree and military seal

415
00:23:58,063 --> 00:23:58,995
to mobilize the army at the main military camp

416
00:23:58,995 --> 00:23:59,778
at the western outskirts of the city.

417
00:24:02,836 --> 00:24:04,626
Enter the capital and pacify the rebellion!

418
00:24:06,292 --> 00:24:08,182
Your Highness is wise!

419
00:24:25,435 --> 00:24:26,877
The two of us are really fated.

420
00:24:28,096 --> 00:24:29,513
When you encounter danger and need to be saved,

421
00:24:29,513 --> 00:24:30,731
you will always bump into me.

422
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,242
You are

423
00:24:33,242 --> 00:24:34,112
my life-preserving deity.

424
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:36,723
Once I get home,

425
00:24:36,996 --> 00:24:37,543
I surely will make you a tablet

426
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:38,537
to pray for your long life.

427
00:24:39,432 --> 00:24:40,328
I must light an incense stick for it

428
00:24:40,328 --> 00:24:41,869
and kowtow to you every day.

429
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,698
How come that didn't sound like

430
00:24:45,698 --> 00:24:46,667
you were thanking me?

431
00:24:48,582 --> 00:24:49,775
No matter how many thanks I say,

432
00:24:49,775 --> 00:24:51,043
all are just empty words.

433
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,311
If there are deities,

434
00:24:52,584 --> 00:24:53,479
they surely will give me

435
00:24:54,001 --> 00:24:55,069
another chance to repay you.

436
00:24:55,866 --> 00:24:57,159
How?

437
00:24:58,302 --> 00:24:59,694
Use my life to repay you.

438
00:25:03,822 --> 00:25:05,637
Why would I want your life?

439
00:25:06,681 --> 00:25:07,128
This...

440
00:25:07,675 --> 00:25:08,148
There aren't that many people

441
00:25:08,148 --> 00:25:09,067
in this world

442
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,212
who could make me pay them with my life.

443
00:25:10,212 --> 00:25:11,554
My mother was one.

444
00:25:11,554 --> 00:25:12,772
My grandmother is another one.

445
00:25:13,344 --> 00:25:15,557
Second Uncle Gu, you're the third one.

446
00:25:18,714 --> 00:25:19,957
What about your future husband?

447
00:25:21,274 --> 00:25:22,194
How would I know about

448
00:25:22,269 --> 00:25:23,611
such a faraway thing?

449
00:25:25,277 --> 00:25:27,465
You don't know, but I do.

450
00:25:28,981 --> 00:25:30,622
You...what do you know?

451
00:25:34,028 --> 00:25:36,017
I know that you have sprained your foot.

452
00:25:36,017 --> 00:25:37,758
You have to recuperate for a few days.

453
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:39,771
Luckily, you didn't hurt your bone.

454
00:25:40,691 --> 00:25:41,686
This will be healed in a few days.

455
00:25:42,531 --> 00:25:43,948
Don't expose the wound on your hand to water.

456
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:45,589
I'll leave Shitou to accompany you.

457
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,777
If I successfully pacify the rebellion,

458
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:50,238
I will light two fireworks.

459
00:25:51,382 --> 00:25:52,848
Tell Shitou then to take you to the palace

460
00:25:52,848 --> 00:25:54,116
to reunite with your father and brother.

461
00:25:54,813 --> 00:25:55,683
If I fail,

462
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,119
I will just light one firework.

463
00:25:59,462 --> 00:26:00,804
At that time,

464
00:26:00,829 --> 00:26:02,097
let Shitou take you to

465
00:26:02,097 --> 00:26:02,793
your Sheng Manor in Jiying Alley by daybreak.

466
00:26:04,633 --> 00:26:06,398
I can see the fireworks and can walk.

467
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:07,200
You, however,

468
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,188
will be in a very dangerous situation.

469
00:26:08,462 --> 00:26:10,177
How about you take Shitou with you instead?

470
00:26:12,414 --> 00:26:13,633
Are you...

471
00:26:14,876 --> 00:26:16,144
worried about me?

472
00:26:16,467 --> 00:26:17,660
Will you die?

473
00:26:30,563 --> 00:26:32,577
Blades have no eyes. Be careful!

474
00:26:33,621 --> 00:26:34,864
Say something auspicious for me to hear!

475
00:26:36,257 --> 00:26:37,177
It's time to go!

476
00:26:42,223 --> 00:26:44,187
Then I...I will wait for your return!

477
00:26:49,135 --> 00:26:51,472
With you waiting, I surely will return!

478
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,414
I... I...I

479
00:26:57,414 --> 00:26:58,533
didn't mean it that way.

480
00:27:24,438 --> 00:27:25,259
I stayed behind

481
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:26,850
not really to accompany you, Miss.

482
00:27:27,844 --> 00:27:29,187
I stayed behind to make my Young Master

483
00:27:29,187 --> 00:27:29,933
feel at ease.

484
00:27:48,628 --> 00:27:49,822
Who are the people outside the city walls?

485
00:27:50,443 --> 00:27:51,155
I'm the commander of the main military camp

486
00:27:51,155 --> 00:27:51,662
in the western city outskirt,

487
00:27:51,662 --> 00:27:54,123
Shenwei General Song Zhao Zhong!

488
00:27:55,242 --> 00:27:56,261
I was decreed to enter the capital!

489
00:27:56,733 --> 00:27:57,280
We just received orders

490
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,126
from the Defense Chief of the palace

491
00:27:58,623 --> 00:27:59,940
to close the city gates ahead of time,

492
00:28:00,264 --> 00:28:01,830
and no one is allowed to enter the city!

493
00:28:02,228 --> 00:28:03,545
Where's your Imperial decree?

494
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,236
Who ordered you?

495
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:12,422
It was Prince Yan who delivered me a letter!

496
00:28:12,819 --> 00:28:13,724
He told us to enter the city

497
00:28:13,724 --> 00:28:14,609
and wait for further orders!

498
00:28:14,783 --> 00:28:15,987
Don't waste any more time!

499
00:28:15,987 --> 00:28:17,095
Quickly open the gates!

500
00:28:28,283 --> 00:28:29,725
Charge!

501
00:28:30,147 --> 00:28:31,366
Charge!

502
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,605
Charge!

503
00:28:43,647 --> 00:28:46,705
It's easy for me to die.

504
00:28:49,837 --> 00:28:53,169
But without a conferment decree,

505
00:28:54,263 --> 00:28:56,525
you will then be unable to justify your claim.

506
00:28:57,296 --> 00:28:58,365
The descendants of the Imperial Zhao family

507
00:28:58,365 --> 00:29:00,155
can then launch a crusade against you.

508
00:29:00,453 --> 00:29:03,064
Let's see how long you can maintain your rule!

509
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,840
Your Highness!

510
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,412
Your Majesty!

511
00:29:12,436 --> 00:29:12,984
Your Highness.

512
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:14,699
Your Highness, don't be rash.

513
00:29:16,017 --> 00:29:18,031
We must have an Imperial decree for this to work.

514
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:25,489
If he won't write it,

515
00:29:27,602 --> 00:29:29,119
I'll write it myself.

516
00:29:30,387 --> 00:29:31,381
Your Highness!

517
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,340
Your Highness!

518
00:29:35,881 --> 00:29:36,776
Your Highness,

519
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:37,457
the Imperial Army from outside

520
00:29:37,457 --> 00:29:38,093
has charged into the palace!

521
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:45,453
I have the Emperor in my hands!

522
00:29:46,397 --> 00:29:48,013
Your Majesty!

523
00:29:48,685 --> 00:29:50,624
Who dares to make any rash moves!

524
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:54,303
Your Highness...

525
00:30:01,687 --> 00:30:02,606
The mastermind of the rebellion,

526
00:30:02,606 --> 00:30:03,403
Prince Yan, is already dead!

527
00:30:03,452 --> 00:30:05,416
All of you, quickly surrender!

528
00:30:05,715 --> 00:30:06,809
Protect the Emperor!

529
00:31:07,918 --> 00:31:09,460
I was late to Your Majesty's defense.

530
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,976
I caused Your Majesty to be startled.

531
00:31:15,426 --> 00:31:16,993
This is heaven's will.

532
00:31:19,529 --> 00:31:21,542
Prince Yan suffered from his own actions.

533
00:31:22,462 --> 00:31:23,830
If not because that child

534
00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:25,769
bumped into you when she went out of the city,

535
00:31:27,111 --> 00:31:28,270
the Empress and I

536
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:30,468
would have died a long time ago.

537
00:31:32,456 --> 00:31:34,097
This is my duty.

538
00:31:38,001 --> 00:31:38,945
You.

539
00:31:40,835 --> 00:31:41,767
You entered the palace

540
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:43,023
when you were eight years old.

541
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:47,398
You once did a spear dance in front of me.

542
00:31:48,467 --> 00:31:49,835
After doing it,

543
00:31:50,307 --> 00:31:52,147
you asked me for some reward money.

544
00:31:55,603 --> 00:31:57,442
I've never seen a child

545
00:31:57,442 --> 00:31:58,710
as bold as you were.

546
00:31:59,133 --> 00:32:00,252
Out of joy,

547
00:32:00,426 --> 00:32:02,613
I gave you that spear.

548
00:32:04,379 --> 00:32:05,348
After that,

549
00:32:05,647 --> 00:32:07,338
you rarely entered the palace.

550
00:32:07,636 --> 00:32:09,227
I haven't seen you recently.

551
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:12,508
You Majesty never forgets what you see.

552
00:32:12,832 --> 00:32:14,572
You are indeed a genius.

553
00:32:15,541 --> 00:32:16,809
Entered the palace?

554
00:32:17,754 --> 00:32:19,072
What do you mean, entered the palace?

555
00:32:20,812 --> 00:32:23,597
He's the second son of old Marquis Ningyuan.

556
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:25,884
He used to frequently enter the palace.

557
00:32:29,663 --> 00:32:30,466
The House of Marquis Ningyuan

558
00:32:30,466 --> 00:32:31,714
have been meritorious officers for generations.

559
00:32:32,522 --> 00:32:34,536
No wonder you achieved such great military merits

560
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:35,679
during the pacification of the southern rebellion.

561
00:32:37,196 --> 00:32:38,464
He has profound hereditary learning.

562
00:32:40,776 --> 00:32:42,143
I got expelled out of our house by my father,

563
00:32:42,466 --> 00:32:43,088
and my mother's surname is Bai.

564
00:32:43,983 --> 00:32:45,872
I didn't deliberately fool you, Commander.

565
00:32:46,071 --> 00:32:47,290
May you forgive me.

566
00:32:49,453 --> 00:32:51,417
Is your leg wound okay?

567
00:32:53,132 --> 00:32:54,002
Thank you, for Your Majesty's concerns.

568
00:32:55,146 --> 00:32:56,016
It's fine.

569
00:32:56,986 --> 00:32:58,552
You still mustn't neglect it.

570
00:32:59,546 --> 00:33:00,814
Call for the Imperial physician!

571
00:33:11,704 --> 00:33:13,543
I remember that when you were little,

572
00:33:14,413 --> 00:33:15,955
you were a mischievous child.

573
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:19,261
A lot of the goldfish in the Imperial garden

574
00:33:19,261 --> 00:33:20,853
have been killed by you.

575
00:33:22,543 --> 00:33:24,035
How come today

576
00:33:24,731 --> 00:33:26,894
you're holding back your words?

577
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:34,526
Your Majesty is showing great concern for me.

578
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,068
I feel so grateful.

579
00:33:36,913 --> 00:33:40,021
But I am puzzled about one thing.

580
00:33:40,742 --> 00:33:42,010
Your Majesty can't bear

581
00:33:42,432 --> 00:33:43,874
to see even a small wound like this,

582
00:33:44,446 --> 00:33:46,559
but how come with just one word from you before,

583
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,151
you destroyed my path to officialdom?

584
00:33:50,512 --> 00:33:51,706
Stop your nonsense!

585
00:33:53,496 --> 00:33:54,888
This lad has been used to being unbridled outside.

586
00:33:54,888 --> 00:33:56,007
He doesn't know to be tactful!

587
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,722
Your Majesty, please forgive him.

588
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:58,915
Let him talk.

589
00:33:59,313 --> 00:34:00,159
Just the past.

590
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,849
Let's not talk about it anymore.

591
00:34:01,924 --> 00:34:03,092
Right. Right. Don't mention it anymore.

592
00:34:03,092 --> 00:34:03,764
Go.

593
00:34:03,764 --> 00:34:04,053
Let's go make an inventory

594
00:34:04,053 --> 00:34:04,410
of the soldiers and horses outside.

595
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:05,479
Regarding this matter...

596
00:34:06,424 --> 00:34:08,562
I indeed was wrong.

597
00:34:12,465 --> 00:34:14,505
I've have always ruled with

598
00:34:14,505 --> 00:34:16,294
benevolence and tolerance.

599
00:34:18,034 --> 00:34:20,545
But because of a joke,

600
00:34:21,341 --> 00:34:22,227
I destroyed the future

601
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:23,429
as an official of Yang Wuduan.

602
00:34:25,443 --> 00:34:26,562
From then on,

603
00:34:27,407 --> 00:34:29,645
I got the wrath of am emperor.

604
00:34:30,092 --> 00:34:31,981
Just one touch of it,and I got angry.

605
00:34:35,785 --> 00:34:36,854
At the time,

606
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:40,260
this child didn't know how to shut his mouth.

607
00:34:40,931 --> 00:34:42,100
He sympathized with the injustice

608
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,144
that Yang Wuduan encountered.

609
00:34:43,691 --> 00:34:45,481
I got upset,

610
00:34:46,401 --> 00:34:47,918
and failed him.

611
00:34:49,683 --> 00:34:51,125
And I even said that

612
00:34:51,995 --> 00:34:54,158
I wanted you to become like Yang Wuduan,

613
00:34:54,605 --> 00:34:55,381
only being able to

614
00:34:55,381 --> 00:34:56,768
take the exam again at age fifty.

615
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:59,354
After saying it,

616
00:34:59,354 --> 00:35:00,771
I also found it inappropriate.

617
00:35:00,771 --> 00:35:03,083
But because of pride,

618
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:04,749
I didn't take it back.

619
00:35:07,459 --> 00:35:08,826
Never thought that today,

620
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,915
you didn't mind this past grudge

621
00:35:10,915 --> 00:35:12,257
and came to my aid.

622
00:35:14,569 --> 00:35:18,149
I should apologize to you

623
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:18,920
right now.

624
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,262
Your Majesty!

625
00:35:21,182 --> 00:35:23,097
Your Majesty, you said it too seriously.

626
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:25,334
For me to stand in front of you today

627
00:35:25,334 --> 00:35:26,577
and question you is so disrespectful.

628
00:35:27,746 --> 00:35:28,269
With Your Majesty willingly

629
00:35:28,269 --> 00:35:28,830
being so straight-out to me,

630
00:35:29,237 --> 00:35:30,754
I feel so grateful!

631
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:32,221
Right.

632
00:35:33,389 --> 00:35:34,760
Your Majesty's graces is as high as

633
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,000
the sky and as vast as the ocean.

634
00:35:36,746 --> 00:35:38,113
You must remember it in your heart.

635
00:35:39,008 --> 00:35:39,704
Yes.

636
00:35:40,226 --> 00:35:41,270
Second Son Gu,

637
00:35:42,513 --> 00:35:45,820
I still can remember the words

638
00:35:46,168 --> 00:35:48,256
you wrote in your essay.

639
00:35:49,624 --> 00:35:50,743
That you want to

640
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:54,397
inherit the aspirations of Fan Zhongyan

641
00:35:55,491 --> 00:35:58,301
and continue his cause.

642
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,571
Then, from now on,

643
00:36:04,093 --> 00:36:06,259
you must assist

644
00:36:06,259 --> 00:36:08,547
Zhao Zongquan and his family

645
00:36:09,787 --> 00:36:12,372
in defending the country and reviving the Imperial court.

646
00:36:13,789 --> 00:36:15,728
I will devote myself

647
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:18,165
to revive the Imperial court of Your Majesty

648
00:36:18,165 --> 00:36:19,880
and defend Your Majesty's territory!

649
00:36:23,933 --> 00:36:26,369
Second Son of Gu is a good one.

650
00:36:26,369 --> 00:36:28,209
For you to be what you are today,

651
00:36:28,209 --> 00:36:30,173
is all thanks to his protection.

652
00:36:31,143 --> 00:36:33,181
From now on, you must treat him kindly.

653
00:36:34,872 --> 00:36:36,291
My dynasty has always favored

654
00:36:36,291 --> 00:36:38,551
the scholars more than the military warriors.

655
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:41,311
But no one must dare

656
00:36:41,311 --> 00:36:42,778
slight the House of Gu!

657
00:36:43,896 --> 00:36:44,667
I surely will.

658
00:36:45,015 --> 00:36:45,761
Your Majesty.

659
00:36:47,253 --> 00:36:50,112
Your Majesty, you should go rest.

660
00:36:51,405 --> 00:36:52,971
Since this morning,

661
00:36:52,971 --> 00:36:55,109
you haven't taken a nap.

662
00:36:59,957 --> 00:37:01,996
I must personally write the conferment decree

663
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,189
before I can be at ease.

664
00:37:04,382 --> 00:37:06,048
Prepare the brush and ink.

665
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:09,478
Prepare the brush and ink.

666
00:37:38,467 --> 00:37:39,462
They succeeded!

667
00:37:39,686 --> 00:37:41,327
Shitou, look!

668
00:37:41,898 --> 00:37:43,340
They made it!

669
00:37:43,937 --> 00:37:45,354
I told you not to worry.

670
00:37:45,354 --> 00:37:46,647
You just wouldn't believe me!

671
00:37:47,318 --> 00:37:48,536
You had to wait for my Young Master

672
00:37:48,536 --> 00:37:49,106
to light the fireworks

673
00:37:49,106 --> 00:37:49,829
before you would believe it.

674
00:38:00,072 --> 00:38:01,166
Be careful.

675
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:08,724
Come, quickly get up into the carriage.

676
00:38:19,762 --> 00:38:20,956
I was able to coincidentally

677
00:38:20,956 --> 00:38:22,249
charge into the palace and save the Emperor today.

678
00:38:22,249 --> 00:38:23,318
It's all thanks to

679
00:38:23,318 --> 00:38:24,809
your Sixth Sister.

680
00:38:28,041 --> 00:38:29,558
Could it be that

681
00:38:30,105 --> 00:38:31,472
when she was escaping,

682
00:38:32,044 --> 00:38:33,038
she bumped into the palace maid

683
00:38:33,038 --> 00:38:33,794
that was delivering His Majesty's

684
00:38:33,794 --> 00:38:34,480
blood-written Imperial decree?

685
00:38:35,127 --> 00:38:36,171
Indeed.

686
00:38:36,842 --> 00:38:38,831
I've already arranged for my servant

687
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,348
to escort your Sixth Sister home.

688
00:38:40,348 --> 00:38:41,566
But...

689
00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:43,530
in front of His Majesty earlier,

690
00:38:44,301 --> 00:38:46,016
I didn't mention her name

691
00:38:46,265 --> 00:38:47,757
and didn't report her merit.

692
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:50,864
I only mentioned that palace maid Ruichu.

693
00:38:51,138 --> 00:38:52,506
I was afraid...

694
00:38:52,903 --> 00:38:54,718
I understand. I understand.

695
00:38:55,439 --> 00:38:56,259
You were also thinking for

696
00:38:56,259 --> 00:38:57,378
my little sister's sake.

697
00:38:58,646 --> 00:39:00,440
Right now, the rebel army

698
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,425
is still within the capital.

699
00:39:02,624 --> 00:39:04,115
They are killing, raping and looting.

700
00:39:04,563 --> 00:39:06,129
If the news of my little sister

701
00:39:06,129 --> 00:39:07,621
escaping the palace gets out,

702
00:39:08,938 --> 00:39:10,952
I fear that it won't be good for her reputation.

703
00:39:12,469 --> 00:39:13,463
It's just that...

704
00:39:14,209 --> 00:39:15,477
your House of Sheng

705
00:39:16,049 --> 00:39:17,217
will have missed

706
00:39:17,217 --> 00:39:18,187
this good meritorious chance.

707
00:39:19,579 --> 00:39:20,499
It's fine.

708
00:39:20,499 --> 00:39:22,438
This merit belongs to that

709
00:39:22,438 --> 00:39:23,880
palace maid who sacrificed her life.

710
00:39:24,676 --> 00:39:25,596
My little sister just

711
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:26,764
coincidentally bumped into her.

712
00:39:27,585 --> 00:39:28,678
Yes. Yes.

713
00:39:28,952 --> 00:39:30,046
Since she was able to save His Majesty

714
00:39:30,046 --> 00:39:31,314
and preserve her reputation,

715
00:39:31,314 --> 00:39:32,408
that's the best outcome.

716
00:39:32,905 --> 00:39:33,676
That's right.

717
00:39:33,676 --> 00:39:34,819
Quickly go back to have a rest.

718
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,742
Let's quickly go home.

719
00:39:39,841 --> 00:39:40,885
Yes.

720
00:39:42,551 --> 00:39:43,247
When you go back, remember to

721
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:43,993
instruct your Sixth Little Sister

722
00:39:43,993 --> 00:39:45,062
not to tell anyone

723
00:39:45,062 --> 00:39:46,579
that she went into the palace,

724
00:39:46,579 --> 00:39:47,747
including her grandmother.

725
00:39:48,369 --> 00:39:49,040
Got it.

726
00:39:51,576 --> 00:39:53,018
How come you've become such a nag

727
00:39:53,018 --> 00:39:54,410
after fighting wars?

728
00:40:26,556 --> 00:40:28,197
Drink some more.

729
00:40:29,987 --> 00:40:31,976
Here. Drink one more mouthful.

730
00:41:23,016 --> 00:41:25,279
Your Majesty!

731
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,834
Wishing Your Majesty good health!

732
00:42:18,234 --> 00:42:21,565
Long live Your Majesty!
