00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,004
Episode 68

3
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,040
Your Highness, you didn't know.

4
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,920
When I gave birth to her,

5
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,640
it was a difficult delivery.

6
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,160
I was in labor pain for three days

7
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,480
before I gave life to her.

8
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,160
Now, Gu Marquis

9
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,960
just killed her with one stab of his sword.

10
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,200
I will never

11
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,200
be able to see her again.

12
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,240
Your Highness,

13
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,838
I'm a person who's lived

14
00:01:49,838 --> 00:01:51,200
more than half of my life already.

15
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,360
I hate

16
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,200
myself for not being able to die on her behalf.

17
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,360
I'm someone who's not fated to have any children.

18
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,720
You are better than me.

19
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,240
Three of my children didn't survive.

20
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,320
You are fortunate to still have two.

21
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,690
They all said that our children

22
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,240
are our debts from the past life.

23
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,680
As Buddha said, because we asks, hence, we suffer.

24
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,720
The child is dead.

25
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,360
We are still alive.

26
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,600
You...

27
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,840
when you were just a maiden,

28
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,000
you are already a very narrow-minded person.

29
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,280
Enough, get up now.

30
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,480
Let the two lonely old women

31
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,400
like us sit and chat.

32
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,080
Please get up.

33
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,480
Take your time.

34
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,400
Old Madam, you are tired.

35
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,640
Try the peach flower wine that

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,360
Empress Dowager

37
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,200
personally made.

38
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,360
Eunuch, I have to trouble you then.

39
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,320
Lord Wang,

40
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,760
why are you still kneeling?

41
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,320
Get up now.

42
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,440
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

43
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,040
Look at how lucky you are.

44
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,760
You still have a son.

45
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,880
I don't have any single child anymore.

46
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,560
You are better than me.

47
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,040
You have your own biological son.

48
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,600
You have good luck.

49
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,840
My son is of lowly rank and with poor qualities.

50
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,560
How can he be compared with His Majesty?

51
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,400
His Majesty is the son of heaven

52
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,160
and is mandated by heavenly fate.

53
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,880
Look at you.

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,200
Why are you kneeling again?

55
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,640
The two of us

56
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,880
have lived through several emperors.

57
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,360
We're just chatting here.

58
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,000
We're old.

59
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,520
Isn't it just matters about our children?

60
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,080
From the palace to the common folks,

61
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,280
no matter how you talk about it,

62
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,160
it's just the same thing.

63
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,280
Get up now.

64
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,200
Yes.

65
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,520
Yes.

66
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:20,920
You just

67
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,440
mentioned that Marquis who killed your daughter.

68
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,000
I watched him grow up, too.

69
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,800
He is good to be talented and smart.

70
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,280
It's just that he is too young,

71
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,920
and lacks maturity

72
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,720
and prudence.

73
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,760
I even heard that

74
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,960
when His Majesty asked him for an audience earlier,

75
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,960
he even defied it

76
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,600
and stayed home to look after his child.

77
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,920
He...

78
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,280
how could he be so bold?

79
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,640
I've cut it too much.

80
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,400
Empress Dowager is also out of ideas.

81
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,520
When the wick of a lamp is too long, it should be cut.

82
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,840
If you cut it,

83
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,200
it can then burn longer.

84
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,480
Escort the guests out.

85
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,840
Lord Wang, please.

86
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,840
Mother, about this...

87
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,720
Get two bowls of noodles.

88
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,760
Give me two bowls of pastries.

89
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,800
Alright.

90
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,000
Old wife, cook the noodles.

91
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,880
When you encounter major events, you must be calm.

92
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,160
Eating few when there are a lot of problems

93
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,520
isn't a sign of long life.

94
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,560
Eat. Let's talk once we are done.

95
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,520
Mother, Her Highness...

96
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,480
Look at this oil lamp.

97
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,080
You father has died more than decades.

98
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,240
When the person has left, the tea grows cold.

99
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,480
Our Wang House is like this lamp,

100
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,240
we're about to get extinguished.

101
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,160
Mother, what are you talking about?

102
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,560
Although I'm not successful,

103
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,720
and I've diminished a lot of father's prestige,

104
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:03,650
the political arena

105
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,440
is a complex and unpredictable place.

106
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,720
I still have some dignity.

107
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,040
Look at this oil lamp again.

108
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,014
We currently can be considered

109
00:08:14,014 --> 00:08:14,960
to be at the bright side.

110
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,400
But what's beyond

111
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,880
this small lighted area?

112
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,080
If your father is still alive,

113
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,840
no matter

114
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,520
how grave your little sister's crime was,

115
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,160
would those Gu

116
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,640
and Sheng people dare to give us a stern face?

117
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,680
I am not just defending your little sister.

118
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,640
I still need to protect the dignity of the House of Wang.

119
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,320
Mother, this is...

120
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,880
My father risked his life

121
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,160
fighting for a career from a remote province.

122
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,080
The House of Wang didn't have it easy.

123
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,960
Now,

124
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,680
we have a few assets and a respectable official status.

125
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,560
Why must you still risk getting the chestnut out of the fire?

126
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,000
If a parent loves their child,

127
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,880
they should plan for their future.

128
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,360
Your father and I

129
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,720
started from a deserted region

130
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,760
and struggled to give you a bright place.

131
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,160
Hence,

132
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,440
even if you're not a talented child,

133
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,960
you're able to stay in the political arena until today.

134
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,040
But what have you striven

135
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,040
for your own child?

136
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,280
This...

137
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,306
The vast achievements of a lord

138
00:09:28,306 --> 00:09:30,600
will be exhausted after several generations.

139
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,520
Now, you're the master of the House of Wang.

140
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,240
It's such an important matter.

141
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,040
Think carefully about this.

142
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,040
Be resolute.

143
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,725
No matter

144
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,520
what you choose, as your mother,

145
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,280
I will follow it.

146
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,058
The throne of the current emperor

147
00:10:21,058 --> 00:10:23,840
was given by the past emperor.

148
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,000
One must first be the son of the emperor

149
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,880
before he can inherit the throne.

150
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,040
But His Majesty

151
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,200
listened to the words of fawning subjects like Gu Tingye

152
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,400
training soldiers and horses, preparing for war,

153
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,160
disobeying the initial intention of the past emperor.

154
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,880
He also broke faith and abandoned the right.

155
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,680
He wanted to call both Prince Shu

156
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,560
and the past emperor as fathers.

157
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,440
How can there be a son having two fathers?

158
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,680
The emperor is magnanimous,

159
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,360
but fawning and evil subjects are holding him up.

160
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,320
It's hard for him to fully practice it.

161
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,320
The Marquis barged into your study.

162
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,800
He said that he would wait for you there.

163
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,600
Did he say why he is here?

164
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,480
No,

165
00:11:08,725 --> 00:11:10,965
but he looks unhappy.

166
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,760
He probably is here for trouble.

167
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,240
Yuanruo.

168
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,240
If you came here to scold me,

169
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,560
I have only this to say.

170
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,360
I brought men to put out the fire.

171
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,160
I didn't had any other intentions.

172
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,080
I took the initiative to do this.

173
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,400
We are relatives.

174
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,720
I can't just watch and do nothing.

175
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,640
What are you laughing at?

176
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,520
I'm not here for a punitive expedition.

177
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,120
Yuanruo,

178
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,725
why must you pull your sword

179
00:11:45,725 --> 00:11:46,200
and ready your bow like this?

180
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,880
Then, you are...

181
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,720
What is this for?

182
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,720
Last night, you didn't mind the danger

183
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,480
and extended your help.

184
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,080
On behalf of my family, I thank you.

185
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,040
This...

186
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,040
I didn't help too much.

187
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,080
Come.

188
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,880
Before I returned,

189
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,680
I was very perturbed.

190
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,680
What if I didn't rush there on time,

191
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,120
I fear the mother and child wouldn't have survived.

192
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,320
Afterwards, I heard from my servants

193
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,600
that the Young Lord Qi of the Ducal House

194
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,040
brought men to help in putting out the fire.

195
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,240
Yuanruo,

196
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,480
only then was I relieved.

197
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,160
I took the initiative.

198
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,560
It's good that you don't blame me.

199
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,080
Why would I blame you?

200
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,520
You are a genuine gentleman.

201
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,720
I'm very grateful.

202
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,880
It's just to lift a finger. Not worthy to be mentioned.

203
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,120
About this...

204
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,640
whatever happened in the past,

205
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,120
it's already in the past.

206
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,680
It was a misunderstanding. I was at fault too.

207
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,680
Now that

208
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,360
we've said things out in the open.

209
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,720
Yuanruo, you are a smart person.

210
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,920
You surely will have a bright future ahead.

211
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,600
Second Uncle.

212
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,600
You are right.

213
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,000
There are still a lot of things at home that

214
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,240
must be fixed and managed.

215
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,160
I'm taking my leave first.

216
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,040
Next time, I'll bring my wife and child

217
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,120
together to visit you with some gifts.

218
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,280
No need to be so courteous.

219
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,040
I'll take my leave.

220
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,920
The imperial decree of Empress Dowager

221
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,440
was personally stamped by her.

222
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,320
Yuanruo,

223
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,880
you have a kind temperament.

224
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,040
Don't be too stubborn about official matters,

225
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,600
or you might hurt yourself.

226
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,240
What are you doing here?

227
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,520
I heard that Gu Tingye barged in here.

228
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,000
I...I was afraid that

229
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,000
he would harm you.

230
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,120
Gu Marquis is skilled in fighting.

231
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,640
You are holding this short sword

232
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,440
to kill him?

233
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,200
Aren't you afraid that you would hurt yourself?

234
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:56,960
Give it to me.

235
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,520
Even if he's the reincarnation of a heavenly deity,

236
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,400
I won't let him hurt you.

237
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,080
I know.

238
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,440
Thank you.

239
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,720
Now that it has come to this,

240
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,560
there is something

241
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,440
I need to confess to you.

242
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,960
The Big Madam of the Gu's

243
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,880
was the first person I wanted to marry.

244
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,000
There's no need to mention the past.

245
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,480
But...

246
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,520
I would like to hear.

247
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,360
Forget it.

248
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,680
I don't want to listen.

249
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,040
It's better not to talk about it.

250
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,280
Master,

251
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,160
someone from Bianjing asked to see you.

252
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,160
The surname is Gu.

253
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,920
Gu?

254
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,000
Say that I'm not here.

255
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,960
Tell them to leave now.

256
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,080
Master Bai, no need to be afraid.

257
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,120
We've seen each other before

258
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,800
in the capital's Yuqing Monastery.

259
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,790
Aren't you the main Madam of the marquis manor?

260
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,240
I'm not.

261
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,520
You're not?

262
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,640
But that day, in Yuqing Monastery…

263
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,840
That time, our family didn't know

264
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,920
your intentions.

265
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,480
Naturally, we needed to be careful.

266
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,560
It's enough to just send a servant like me

267
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,720
to disguise as the Grand Madam.

268
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,200
But...but...

269
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,600
You will naturally understand everything

270
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,960
once you go to the capital with me

271
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,160
to see the Grand Madam.

272
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,240
Go to the capital?

273
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,880
The last time I went there,

274
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,280
I almost died.

275
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,640
How do you still plan to torment me?

276
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,640
I'm not going.

277
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,600
Men, tell her to leave.

278
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:43,880
Madam, please.

279
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,800
In the hands of Gu Second

280
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,800
is a vast amount of assets owned by the Bai’s,

281
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,760
the top salt merchant of Jiangnan.

282
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,960
Eldest Bai, you've plotted for it all your life

283
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,320
and the chance is being given right in front of you.

284
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,480
I never thought that

285
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,320
you don't have any manliness at all.

286
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,520
I have to be alive first.

287
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,160
Now, Gu Second killed a woman with conferred title.

288
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,280
He won't be able to deny it.

289
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,280
You have

290
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,400
such a good fate.

291
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,880
Using the life of someone else

292
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,920
to take back your family's vast assets,

293
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,200
isn't that

294
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,480
a wealth bestowed to you by the heaven?

295
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,720
He killed someone?

296
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,680
Not just killed someone,

297
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,697
he killed a woman with conferred title,

298
00:18:27,697 --> 00:18:28,640
an official's wife,

299
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,450
the legitimate daughter

300
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,120
of an Imperial Tutor.

301
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,960
Pack my suitcase and prepare the carriage.

302
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,280
No need.

303
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,680
The carriage of the Marquis

304
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,800
is waiting out there for you.

305
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,640
It has a strong horse and soft carriage.

306
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,360
Eldest Bai, please.

307
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,240
Have a bite!

308
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,760
I'm old.

309
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,720
I was thinking.

310
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,760
Why don't you let Yong'er

311
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,640
be raised in my palace?

312
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,200
One, you'll get to be free

313
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,280
to take good care of the Emperor.

314
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,760
Second,

315
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,200
I get to taste

316
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,360
the joy of raising a child.

317
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,640
Treat it as a gift to show your respect to me.

318
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,120
Look,

319
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,120
how scared this child is.

320
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,960
I haven't said anything yet.

321
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,200
Quickly, go and bring the wine here.

322
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,400
Suppress the shock of Imperial Consort.

323
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,320
This is a wine personally

324
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,440
made by Empress Dowager.

325
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,560
May Your Highness moist your throat with it.

326
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,880
Your Highness,

327
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,400
have you asked it clearly?

328
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,880
It's not suitable to talk here.

329
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,480
Let's go to our room to talk.

330
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,200
Third Younger Sister.

331
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,080
My Lady,

332
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,440
what's wrong with you?

333
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,680
Let me think.

334
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,880
Let me think carefully.

335
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,400
For the entire day,

336
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,880
what was wrong with you?

337
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,640
Since you came back,

338
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,440
you didn't say a single word.

339
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,840
What's going on?

340
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,825
Yong'er.

341
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,480
He's still playing so happily.

342
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,440
Yes,

343
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,480
the child doesn't know anything.

344
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,160
No matter where he is, he will be equally happy.

345
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,320
What did the Empress Dowager

346
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,520
say to you?

347
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,560
My Lady.

348
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,320
My Lady!

349
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,560
Don't follow me!

350
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,720
My Lady.

351
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,560
Imperial Consort, please.

352
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,040
Where's Yong'er?

353
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,480
For Yong'er to be raised

354
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,720
by the Empress Dowager

355
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,480
is also his good fortune.

356
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,880
What? You gave Yong'er...

357
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,360
Didn't brother-in-law want the commander post

358
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,000
of the Palace Front Imperial Army?

359
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:08,920
Yes.

360
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:09,826
Your brother-in-law has long wanted

361
00:23:09,826 --> 00:23:11,000
to be promoted to that position.

362
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:11,880
He will soon receive the notice

363
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,800
from the Ministry of Personnel.

364
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,080
Hence, you left Yong'er...

365
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,000
If the parent loves their child,

366
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,680
they should plan ahead.

367
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,280
This is also for Yong'er's

368
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,200
great future.

369
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,120
Big Madam,

370
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,400
look.

371
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,640
Tuan'er has just finished having his milk.

372
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,200
He's now sleeping very soundly.

373
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,840
Is he able to drink milk?

374
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,080
Of course.

375
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,360
He's quite energetic in doing so.

376
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,920
Good thing you've

377
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,320
hired two milk nannies beforehand.

378
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,800
Or else, he wouldn't have enough milk to drink.

379
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,960
It was Marquis who stopped and calmed him.

380
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,440
He's awake.

381
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,680
This is the Marquis first-born child.

382
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,240
He's so meticulous in his care.

383
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,080
He indeed is very meticulous.

384
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,080
He's even fixing the courtyard

385
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,040
over there.

386
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,880
Where?

387
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,560
Shuixian Pavilion of Miss Fengxian.

388
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,360
Marquis.

389
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,880
It's been 7 or 8 days.

390
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,720
Big Madam just gave birth

391
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,840
and didn't have time to arrange a place for me.

392
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,760
I know this.

393
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,113
It's just that despite Cheng Garden

394
00:25:17,113 --> 00:25:18,000
being such a huge manor,

395
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,120
I actually don't have any lodging place.

396
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,520
My current house is badly damaged.

397
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,046
May marquis give considerations

398
00:25:25,046 --> 00:25:26,000
even for the sake of my status.

399
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,120
Okay.

400
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:31,960
Shitou.

401
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,160
Go to the stockroom

402
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,360
and get me that white jade box.

403
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,480
And then go to the Fire Rescue Team

404
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,000
and choose some clever and able people

405
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,600
to search through this house

406
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,840
and look for the start of the fire.

407
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,680
Yes.

408
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,240
Did Tu Second and Liu Jingli report anything

409
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,040
about their inspection of the manor?

410
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,120
Temporarily none.

411
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,760
It's been quite peaceful lately.

412
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,480
It won't be peaceful soon.

413
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,560
Are you afraid?

414
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,960
Cold weather and frozen ground. Good for killing.

415
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,920
Marquis!

416
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,160
Where will my mistress live?

417
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,280
Marquis is here.

418
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,000
It's too cold out there.

419
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,000
Come here,

420
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,000
let me take a look at my child now.

421
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,080
How's the repair going on?

422
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,600
It won't get fixed that easily.

423
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,880
I think she should be transferred

424
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,320
to another place.

425
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,320
In our Jiaxi House then.

426
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,840
Sure, Jiaxi House is fine too.

427
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,360
Anyway, everything is being handled in a hurry.

428
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,840
There's no way we can find a mason that fast.

429
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,960
Why not just settle her down

430
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,240
in our courtyard then?

431
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,360
You're full of cold air.

432
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,520
Don't pass it to your child.

433
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,240
Xiaotao,

434
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,960
take the food away.

435
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:01,800
I'm sleeping for a while.

436
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,840
Sleep?

437
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,720
Big Madam, didn't you just wake up?

438
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:06,640
You are sleeping again?

439
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,000
What are you laughing at?

440
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,240
Originally,

441
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,120
she kept telling me that

442
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,520
she didn't had a place to live in,

443
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,560
asking me to provide

444
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,840
her another living quarter.

445
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,360
I also found her too long winded.

446
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,440
It was such a hassle.

447
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,640
I so wanted to just drive her away.

448
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,160
Later, after thinking about it,

449
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,440
it was Big Madam

450
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,720
who accepted her on my behalf.

451
00:27:59,975 --> 00:28:00,920
She has a status after all.

452
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,360
Seeing she has been sincere to

453
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,960
me for all these years,

454
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,360
The marquis manor

455
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,760
can afford to provide her food.

456
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,920
Moreover,

457
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,880
If she comes to Jiaxi,

458
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,360
she can help you.

459
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,840
She can serve you tea and water, is that okay?

460
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,760
You can really plan.

461
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,080
I don't know

462
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,480
who it was

463
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,320
that reprimanded me harshly

464
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,200
for making Fengxian stay in our manor?

465
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,000
Now, after a fire broke out,

466
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,360
you sincerely care about her

467
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,640
and don't want to drive her away anymore?

468
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,760
People say that women giving birth to a child

469
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,400
is like going through a great torture.

470
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,920
It's usual

471
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,760
to be bad tempered

472
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,080
but you have really

473
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,760
changed too much.

474
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,760
Be careful that you might scare our kid.

475
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,299
My son is a talent worthy to be

476
00:29:02,299 --> 00:29:03,680
a future general or a prime minister.

477
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,000
How can he be easily scared by you?

478
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,720
Get lost.

479
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:09,920
You're so stinky.

480
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:10,800
Don't suffocate my son with your smell.

481
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,000
You just gave birth to a child.

482
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,640
Don't be angry.

483
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,520
I...

484
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,200
I am angry? Who says I'm angry?

485
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,520
At first, I wonder it was

486
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,040
who said words of a deluge of heavenly flowers

487
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,600
just to marry me.

488
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,200
Now,

489
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,120
there are problems here and there.

490
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,920
Why are there so many problems

491
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,840
in the marquis manor?

492
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,320
This is not the first time that

493
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,480
the marquis manor is having problems.

494
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,760
Why are you angry

495
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,120
after giving birth?

496
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,000
Right?

497
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,760
Marquis Husband, your power is really far-reaching.

498
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,160
How come you're controlling now

499
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,160
when I should be getting angry or not?

500
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,520
You are angry. I'm not angry.

501
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,960
After obtaining a chubby son,

502
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,000
of course, you're very happy.

503
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,920
Of course, I'm happy!

504
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,960
You don't know what my feelings were

505
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,320
when I saw Yuanruo in these past years.

506
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,680
Why did you mention him?

507
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,920
Does he want you to keep Fengxian?

508
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,560
Why can't I mention him?

509
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,760
I was jealous of him

510
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,920
every day.

511
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,160
You are finally jealous now.

512
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,600
Be more jealous.

513
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,720
Come and quick.

514
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,480
Don't help him change clothes.

515
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,840
He has hands and legs!

516
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,880
I'm jealous?

517
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,120
What would I be jealous of?

518
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,280
You have so many maidservants here

519
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,000
in the manor,

520
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,080
why are you ordering mine?

521
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,800
Men,

522
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,480
help your Marquis to change his clothes!

523
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,760
How come

524
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,520
you're of no use at all?

525
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,760
Don't forget.

526
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,560
If not because my Big Madam

527
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,120
rescued you from Qianqiu Brothel,

528
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,120
who knows

529
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:30,920
how your family would have died.

530
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,560
Mother, there's no need to be angry with me.

531
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,720
I couldn't find out anything.

532
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,520
Before, when Marquis wasn't around,

533
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,520
all the items in his study

534
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,520
were stored away.

535
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,240
When I sneaked a look, I couldn't find anything.

536
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,200
Now that the Marquis is back,

537
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,520
the soldiers are standing in front of his study.

538
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,920
I couldn't even get close to it.

539
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,360
You couldn't go into the study?

540
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,840
Can't you get into his bedroom too?

541
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,360
When you stuffed me

542
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,480
to Madam Aunt,

543
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,280
you said it so well,

544
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,640
that Marquis being so young

545
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,600
is such a womanizer,

546
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,840
that Big Madam being an illegitimate daughter

547
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,560
of a lowly official isn't even worth mentioning.

548
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,440
Yet, after entering the marquis manor,

549
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,800
I wasn't even able to touch

550
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,640
the border of Marquis' shadow.

551
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,440
I'm not Deity Daluo.

552
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,440
I don't have the ability to read other people's mind

553
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,560
to know what they're thinking.

554
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,760
No need for you to talk back at me

555
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,760
and tell your sufferings.

556
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,520
It's just

557
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,840
that if you are still not useful from now on,

558
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,520
I fear that

559
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,560
I would be of use soon.

560
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,080
These past days, because of the fire in our home,

561
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,360
Marquis was indeed more diligent in coming to me.

562
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,600
But it's just to look at

563
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,440
the works of the masons.

564
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,480
When he left, I heard Shitou said

565
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,240
that Big Madam lost her temper in Jiaxi.

566
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,920
It's quite rare to see that.

567
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,520
But I don't know why

568
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,880
when Marquis heard that,

569
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,920
he laughed.

570
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,680
He even rushed there to see what's happening.

571
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,600
Home?

572
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,400
Where is your home?

573
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,720
You'd better get it straight.

574
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,280
Grand Madam,

575
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,080
Imperial Consort Liu

576
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:55,960
sent someone from the palace to bestow us gifts.

577
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,621
I hold ten thousand gratitude

578
00:33:03,621 --> 00:33:05,160
towards Her Highness.

579
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,120
I have already set up a banquet outside.

580
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,760
Please stay for a meal before

581
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,400
you leave.

582
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,680
The palace is full of busy work and lately

583
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,800
Old Madam Wang comes to visit

584
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,240
Empress Dowager often .

585
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,480
I fear Imperial Consort

586
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,520
will need me.

587
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,280
I'm leaving first.

588
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:30,800
Tingwei!

589
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,000
Are you not going to have dinner at home again?

590
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,400
Third Young Master.

591
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,800
Third Young Master.

592
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,400
Old Madam Wang...

593
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,080
I need to find a time to make a trip to the palace,

594
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,160
to express gratitude to Noble Consort Liu.

595
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,600
During this salt patrol,

596
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,800
I've already reclaimed the missed tax payments

597
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,840
during the last two decades.

598
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:25,675
The Bureau of Revenue is currently

599
00:34:25,675 --> 00:34:26,040
recording the new deposits

600
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,760
into our warehouse.

601
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,880
I think it can be brought soon

602
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,760
for Your Majesty's view

603
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,120
Your Majesty,

604
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,600
now with our dynasty full of prosperity,

605
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,596
our state warehouse brimming

606
00:34:39,596 --> 00:34:41,280
and support fortified,

607
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,960
I deem this is

608
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,000
a most opportune time to tidy up the borders.

609
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,240
Are these words from you

610
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,040
or the Gu Marquis?

611
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,200
Royal Father.

612
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,920
Gu Marquis...

613
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,840
Gu Marquis is definitely thinking

614
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,560
on your behalf.

615
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,640
These...

616
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,720
these words are from my heart.

617
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,120
Our dynasty has not used weapons

618
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,960
for years.

619
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,040
How long can we last on this peace

620
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,440
negotiating practice?

621
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,480
Why not use this opportunity

622
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,680
to reclaim our lost lands?

623
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,280
Reclaiming the lost lands would be great indeed,

624
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,480
but Ying'er,

625
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,720
there's no need

626
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,960
for you to be so obedient to Gu Marquis.

627
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,800
Don't you think so?

628
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,280
When we go in later,

629
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,440
see less and talk less.

630
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,360
Answer what you are questioned.

631
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,520
Grand Madam,

632
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,800
maybe you're being too careful?

633
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,800
Previously in Yuqing Monastery,

634
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,520
you were disguised as a servant.

635
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,880
And now you don't tell me a word of

636
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
where we're going

637
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,240
It's really hard for others to believe.

638
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,080
Who are they?

639
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,360
Where am I?

640
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,560
There will come the time for you to believe me

641
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,840
Grand Madam Qin, please come in.

642
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,000
You shoot well indeed, Grand Madam.

643
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,120
Your Highness, what words are you speaking of?

644
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,680
I am

645
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,440
just standing a bit closer .

646
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,600
So I have the advantage, naturally.

647
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,760
Just how close are you standing?

648
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,640
This is in your palace.

649
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,800
So naturally, I stand closer to Your Highness.

650
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,120
It seems

651
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,000
I'd better stand closer, too.

652
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,680
Since this is your own kettle

653
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,880
in your own palace,

654
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,440
however you stand,

655
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,440
it's still up to you.

656
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,120
Alright. Don't stand there.

657
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,720
Sit, have some fruits and rest.

658
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,040
I will abide.

659
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,600
On the method of this tea,

660
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,360
it's all about meditation

661
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,600
and absent-mindedness.

662
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,400
If you whisk it too hurriedly,

663
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,174
the water drops splash

664
00:38:03,174 --> 00:38:04,640
and the appearance is ill to sight.

665
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,200
But too slow,

666
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,640
and it can't grasp the cup.

667
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,840
You end up with water traces,

668
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,360
and that's making a fool of yourself.

669
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,320
You are right.

670
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,680
Certain good things

671
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,000
takes time

672
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:26,920
and experience

673
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:30,040
in order to see the outcome.

674
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,200
Isn't that so?

675
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,520
In this royal palace,

676
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,840
the most seasoned hand with teas

677
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,800
is certainly the Empress Dowager.

678
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,560
Now, my Yong'er

679
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,480
is being raised under Empress Dowager.

680
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,200
He will learn some principles

681
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,880
from Empress Dowager for sure.

682
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,920
Look at this set of Great Jade Tea Set.

683
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,160
It's a gift from Empress Dowager.

684
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,560
Lord, don't,

685
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,640
sit.

686
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,520
Lord,

687
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,880
why are you standing? Sit.

688
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,760
Your family name is Bai?

689
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,160
Yes.

690
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,920
Living in Jiangnan?

691
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,320
Yes, that's right.

692
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,360
Sit.

693
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,200
"Spring breeze makes green again

694
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,440
the shores of Jiangnan."

695
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,360
Jiangnan is a good place.

696
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,000
Lord, whenever you want to go there for leisure,

697
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,800
I will definitely take good care of you.

698
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,440
Sit.

699
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,560
By the way,

700
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,920
I heard you are in the salt business.

701
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,440
Yes, just a humble enterprise .

702
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,920
I wonder how

703
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,000
your family's salt tastes.

704
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,520
Salt is the chief of all flavors.

705
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Salt from my family's is as pure white as snow.

706
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,400
It's not anything others can compete with.

707
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,280
Then, is there an introduction

708
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,680
about your family salt?

709
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,680
Is it among the tributes?

710
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,240
How can we presume

711
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,400
attention for tribute?

712
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,320
You may not know.

713
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,160
I have a nephew,

714
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,080
who is quite a tyrant.

715
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,920
It's not urgent.

716
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,360
As long as the item is good.

717
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,360
We won't worry about not having others, right?

718
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,760
I also hope that

719
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,040
when you are here again,

720
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,080
bring some salt

721
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,200
for the Imperial Consort,

722
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,880
too.

723
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,480
Imperial Consort?

724
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,840
And the man said,

725
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,240
as long as the item is good.

726
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,000
All others we will have

727
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,000
Have all?

728
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,440
This Yong'er

729
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,800
is being raised under the Empress Dowager.

730
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,240
What is that place?

731
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,720
A place in heaven

732
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,160
and a place on earth.

733
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,640
Big Madam from Fourth House is here.

734
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,480
I got it. Leave now.

735
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,680
Fourth House is here.

736
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,560
It's time she came.

737
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,840
Set up a place for this man

738
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,840
and settle him.

739
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,440
Watch him carefully. Don't let him wander.

740
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:23,800
I know.

741
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,400
Marquis

742
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,840
My newly brewed Meishou Wine

743
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:46,720
used the recipe

744
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,720
from Jinhua

745
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,960
and Fengyue House.

746
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,560
Marquis can try it.

747
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,280
Madam Eleventh.

748
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,520
Let me use your room for a while.
