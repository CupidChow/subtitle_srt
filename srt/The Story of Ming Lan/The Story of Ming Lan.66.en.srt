00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,516
Episode 66

3
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,400
If Mistress Lin is still alive,

4
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,160
Fourth Miss will surely be able to return

5
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,500
to her maiden house in a splendid manner.

6
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,320
How can it be like this now?

7
00:01:11,475 --> 00:01:12,475
It's already noon,

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,520
but no one is coming out to welcome her.

9
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,440
For an illegitimate daughter like her,

10
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,280
not working on the stove to serve tea or water

11
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,040
is already great graces from her Main Mother.

12
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,650
What? You still want to open the middle gates

13
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,065
and set up a long altar with incenses?

14
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,075
You don't know that

15
00:01:31,075 --> 00:01:32,790
when Mistress Lin was still alive,

16
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,800
the whole house

17
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,150
listened to her.

18
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,365
That little sister of yours

19
00:01:36,365 --> 00:01:38,375
can only hide inside Weiruixuan

20
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:39,775
to account the books.

21
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,000
That little sister of mine is an idiot.

22
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:49,070
A concubine was able to pinch her like an ant.

23
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,640
She was controlled by others for so many years.

24
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,800
If that Mistress Lin of yours ended up in my hands,

25
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,480
she would have died a thousand times.

26
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,400
You think you will have the chance

27
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:57,880
to say anything here?

28
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,440
You are also someone's prisoner now,

29
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:01,772
and can only eat food like that.

30
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,680
You are worse than a commode disposing person like me.

31
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:04,905
In a few days,

32
00:02:04,905 --> 00:02:06,120
you'll even get sent to the palace prison.

33
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,480
What are you being arrogant about?

34
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,680
Even if I'm eating these food,

35
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,240
I'm still an official's wife.

36
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:16,672
My status in my clan genealogy

37
00:02:16,672 --> 00:02:17,527
is still an official's wife.

38
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,240
Who do you think you are?

39
00:02:21,298 --> 00:02:23,149
Let me tell you, the Sheng's doesn't have the guts

40
00:02:23,149 --> 00:02:24,438
to send me to the palace prison.

41
00:02:24,438 --> 00:02:25,400
Let's just wait and see.

42
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,151
The clearance notice from

43
00:02:27,151 --> 00:02:27,920
the palace prison has arrived.

44
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,360
You wait and see.

45
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,320
If your Fourth Miss Molan

46
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,080
is really living a splendid life as you claimed,

47
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,760
she should be showering you a bit.

48
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,040
Isn't she still a miss that grew under you?

49
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,040
Is she now enjoying the good life

50
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,345
as a Big Madam in the Count Manor by herself?

51
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,440
Let me do it.

52
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,200
Father,

53
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,280
I heard from the servants that

54
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,640
there was a robbery which was an inside job.

55
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,200
May I ask who the internal spy is?

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,160
How did the collusion happen?

57
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,200
Just some miscellaneous matters.

58
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,120
It's been taken care of. No need to worry.

59
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,400
I also heard that the people of Sixth Miss interrogated

60
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,960
and tortured people in our house.

61
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,800
This...

62
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,240
I fear isn't something

63
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,320
that scholarly families like us should do.

64
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,840
I am very worried.

65
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,480
I fear that with Sixth Little Sister

66
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,960
going against the usual,

67
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,960
your reputation might be tarnished.

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,047
Although interrogating with torture

69
00:04:17,047 --> 00:04:17,920
is indeed not an amicable act,

70
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,400
in order to catch the criminal

71
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,181
and to make Old Madam,

72
00:04:21,782 --> 00:04:23,542
your grandmother, be at ease,

73
00:04:23,883 --> 00:04:25,123
I can't really care about that much anymore.

74
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,640
Father,

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,600
it's just catching a house thief.

76
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:30,934
Why must the guards of the marquis manor

77
00:04:30,934 --> 00:04:32,160
still get dispatched here?

78
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,840
Our family already has a lot of servants.

79
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,480
This act of Sixth Little Sister

80
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,360
is really frightful to the ear.

81
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,080
Moreover, Maternal Aunt Kang

82
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,280
just...

83
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,920
What do you want to ask?

84
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,880
What do you really want to know?

85
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,240
I only wanted

86
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,840
to come back to my maiden house and visit everyone.

87
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,880
I never expected that

88
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,360
everyone is treating me like an outsider.

89
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,400
There clearly is a hidden story in this matter.

90
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,600
If an outsider can't know it,

91
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,240
as your daughter, can't I know it?

92
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,560
Now,

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,240
everyone in the family knows,

94
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,080
except me.

95
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,640
When I ask,

96
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,760
no one wants to answer me.

97
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,640
What?

98
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,640
Is my surname not Sheng anymore?

99
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,160
I'm not your flesh and blood anymore?

100
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,437
Why must everyone guard against me

101
00:05:32,437 --> 00:05:33,400
and hide things from me?

102
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,240
Of course, you're still my flesh and blood.

103
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,280
I know that

104
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,640
my marriage before angered you a lot.

105
00:05:51,332 --> 00:05:52,372
But no matter what,

106
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,680
that Liang Family is a count family.

107
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,920
If this gets out,

108
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,720
you still earn some honor.

109
00:05:59,662 --> 00:06:00,782
Second,

110
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,200
we are connected by blood.

111
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,720
Now that something happened to our house,

112
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,040
I have been worried all day long,

113
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,160
unable to eat or drink.

114
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,280
My siblings can all know it,

115
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,640
but why can't I?

116
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,400
Am I that unbearable?

117
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,120
Look at what you're saying,

118
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,840
describing yourself like that.

119
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,680
For this matter,

120
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,080
the more people know about it,

121
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,440
the more danger there will be.

122
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,760
Even if Hualan and Rulan know,

123
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,600
just for mother's reputation...

124
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,952
Sixth Sister will never say a word

125
00:06:44,952 --> 00:06:46,640
for grandmother's sake.

126
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,000
Changfeng and his wife got deceived by us.

127
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,200
No need to worry.

128
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,587
But for outsiders,

129
00:06:52,587 --> 00:06:53,560
it's hard to say.

130
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,640
Father,

131
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,160
the two of us are now imperial court officials.

132
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,680
We must always be careful in everything that we do.

133
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,200
There isn't any hidden story in this matter.

134
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,560
You're just overthinking.

135
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,560
You're already married off.

136
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,680
Just worry more about the family of your husband.

137
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,680
Everything is fine in my husband's house.

138
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,400
Moreover,

139
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm still a member of the Sheng Family.

140
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,480
It's just right for me to care about you.

141
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,800
These past days, I haven't seen Big Madam...

142
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,120
Your in-law's family is doing well?

143
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,440
I have two sons and four daughters.

144
00:07:43,948 --> 00:07:45,960
Each one now has bloomed and borne fruit.

145
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,360
Whether it's your older brother and his wife,

146
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,440
or those other brother-in-laws of yours,

147
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,040
can be said to be a harmonious marital relationship,

148
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,040
except you.

149
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,699
Every other day,

150
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:56,720
there would be trouble in your house.

151
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,120
Since you got married,

152
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,160
you still haven't borne any children.

153
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,960
Your husband's harem is such a chaos.

154
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,400
Even a man like me knows about it.

155
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,776
You instead say that

156
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,520
you're living well in your in-law's house?

157
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,480
No...

158
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,000
Father,

159
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,120
why are you suddenly talking about my situation?

160
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,200
You can talk about others,

161
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,280
but I can't talk about you?

162
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,120
You and your siblings are all my blood,

163
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,253
why don't you compete with

164
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,400
your siblings for other skills?

165
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,400
Always asking around for gossips.

166
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,160
What kind of right etiquette is that?

167
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,800
Your own family is already so messed up.

168
00:08:36,734 --> 00:08:38,560
You still have the time to care about your maiden family?

169
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,075
Running after less important things,

170
00:08:41,075 --> 00:08:42,550
clueless of what's important.

171
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,600
Father,

172
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,599
you know that I'm not that kind of person.

173
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,880
When you and your Little Mother did such a shameless thing,

174
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,827
I didn't go after you.

175
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,640
You instead come here to inquire about my matter?

176
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,640
Quickly get out.

177
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,760
You're tainting my calligraphy.

178
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,640
Fourth Miss! Fourth Miss!

179
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,760
Fourth Miss, I'm Nanny Xue.

180
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,040
How come you've become like that?

181
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,200
Miss,

182
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,960
it's good to see you.

183
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,840
I beg you to tell Master

184
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,720
to let me follow you to the Count Manor.

185
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,644
Miss,

186
00:10:20,644 --> 00:10:23,520
I really can't endure my life here anymore.

187
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,400
Why are you following me?

188
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,400
Miss,

189
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,440
your Count Manor surely

190
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,800
has a lot of hidden shoals and dangerous reefs.

191
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,320
I saw you grow up.

192
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,240
I really am worried to leave you battling alone there.

193
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,080
Miss,

194
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,640
let me go with you.

195
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,600
You can treat me as a stepping stone.

196
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,320
I don't mind.

197
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,920
No need.

198
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,360
Everyone there listens to me.

199
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,040
Miss,

200
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,280
if you are disgusted with me now,

201
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,120
I also won't force you.

202
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,640
But just to let you marry into a good family,

203
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,160
my leg got broken.

204
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,120
I ask you to give me some silver as my protection.

205
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:03,840
Please?

206
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,960
Nanny Zhou,

207
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,960
when you followed my Little Mother before,

208
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,960
I'm sure you got a lot of money from her.

209
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,480
I'm sure that they are enough to buy you mountains or lands.

210
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,160
Why cry as being poor here?

211
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,760
I...

212
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,240
I indeed has some money back then.

213
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,600
But just to let you marry into the Liang Family,

214
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,760
how much have I spent?

215
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,520
After the matter was exposed,

216
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,720
I got caned 20 times

217
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,600
and my leg was crippled.

218
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,200
From a steward,

219
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,520
I was demoted to a stove attendant.

220
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,412
My little savings were also confiscated and drained dry.

221
00:11:39,412 --> 00:11:40,080
Miss!

222
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,680
Since you are this inconsiderate of old affection,

223
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,160
unwilling to give even a little money just to help me survive,

224
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,200
don't blame me for tattling some rumors.

225
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,920
If you dare say one word out,

226
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,400
be careful of losing that other leg of yours.

227
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,320
Leave!

228
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,440
A few days ago,

229
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,640
a huge matter happened here in the Sheng Family.

230
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,560
You surely don't know what it was, right?

231
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,760
Miss, why don't you spare me some change?

232
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,440
I'll take you to meet a person,

233
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,200
who's being closely kept here.

234
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,480
By then,

235
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,720
just don't shout from being shocked.

236
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,600
Why are you here?

237
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,480
You...are actually here?

238
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,400
She.

239
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,320
Why did you come here?

240
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,600
No wonder!

241
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,200
They all said that you went to the farmstead to recuperate.

242
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,126
No wonder,

243
00:14:06,126 --> 00:14:07,880
all the people around you disappeared.

244
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,360
Wang Ruofu also disappeared.

245
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,320
You two have committed a grave crime?

246
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,760
Laugh!

247
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,880
Just laugh hard!

248
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,406
If you are that capable,

249
00:14:31,406 --> 00:14:32,960
make that louder so everyone can hear you!

250
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,240
The Fourth Miss of the Sheng Family,

251
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,000
the Sixth Madam of a Count Manor,

252
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,400
disguising as a manure disposing personnel

253
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,360
to come to this room.

254
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,120
You've watched enough of my embarrassment.

255
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,040
If you still don't go out,

256
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,680
I'm shouting already!

257
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,800
Maternal Aunt,

258
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,080
my good Maternal Aunt,

259
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,840
even if you speak and everyone knows,

260
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,800
so what?

261
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,000
Why don't you tell me the details instead?

262
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,280
What really has happened?

263
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,200
Where's Wang Ruofu?

264
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,440
Why did she place you here,

265
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,120
and where did she go?

266
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,040
That bitch Wang Ruofu...

267
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,360
Just for self-preservation,

268
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,560
will she still care about me?

269
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,640
Maternal Aunt,

270
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,040
why don't you tell me more?

271
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
The more things that you tell me,

272
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,320
the abler I might be to give you some convenience.

273
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,960
Tell you?

274
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,440
I'm a main wife.

275
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,160
What are you?

276
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,200
I find it dirty to even talk a bit more to a lowly being like you.

277
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,200
Quickly leave.

278
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,200
Yes, I'm an illegitimate daughter.

279
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,000
But I'm also the main wife

280
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,120
of a legitimate son of a count.

281
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,520
You are now a prisoner.

282
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,440
Do you still have any useful person

283
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,120
by your side now?

284
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,800
Maternal Aunt,

285
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,080
you hate that bitch Wang Ruofu,

286
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,240
so do I.

287
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,800
Aren't we the people on the same boat,

288
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,600
the ants on the same rope?

289
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,920
You even said that there's a huge matter that you would tell me.

290
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,040
You fooled me to come here

291
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,240
and asked me to disguise as such.

292
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,880
Yet,

293
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,120
you don't really know anything.

294
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,120
This trip was just in vain.

295
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
Big Madam,

296
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,400
you won't be able to go out anyway.

297
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,280
Why don't you just tell it to our Miss?

298
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,120
Treat it as venting your anger.

299
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,120
I indeed can't go out anymore.

300
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,840
But on what basis must I tell it to your Miss?

301
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,240
You think I'm some storyteller in the covered market?

302
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,970
It's not that hard if you want to go out.

303
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,080
It's just a matter of spending some silver.

304
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,520
It will now depend on

305
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,520
whether the information you're going to tell me

306
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,920
is worthy of those money or not.

307
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,400
Money?

308
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,200
What time is it already?

309
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:58,920
You still are telling me

310
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,240
if it's worthy of money or not?

311
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,840
I fear that if I say it,

312
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,080
you might be unable to pay the price.

313
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,280
You mean...

314
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,400
There's a snack

315
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,000
rubbed with concentrated juice of ginkgo sprout.

316
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,320
Hence, that devout old woman of Shou'an Hall ate it

317
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,200
and got sick.

318
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,200
And then?

319
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,560
You still want to know more?

320
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,200
You then have to wait once I feel more comfortable,

321
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,880
when my surrounding is cleaner,

322
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,520
when I'm able to get out in the open before I will say it.

323
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,800
Are you saying it or not?

324
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,280
If not,

325
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,080
this dirty water will be where your feet will be soaked.

326
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,600
It's good if my legs become crippled.

327
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,000
You think I'll be afraid of your dirty water?

328
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,200
Okay.

329
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,920
I'll make you openly say it then.

330
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,520
Let's go.

331
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,760
I'm going to get out soon.

332
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,920
Fire! Fire!

333
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,760
Don't fan it!

334
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,920
Fire!

335
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,080
Fire!

336
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,640
Fire! Fire!

337
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,920
Fire!

338
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,640
Help!

339
00:19:15,735 --> 00:19:16,455
Help!

340
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,160
Hurry!

341
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,280
Help! Fire! Fire!

342
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,280
Fire! Fire! Hurry!

343
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,840
Fire! Fire!

344
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,440
Right! There's a fire!

345
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:30,920
Where?

346
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,480
Where's the fire?

347
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,280
Kitchen is on fire!

348
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,560
Go get the items. I'll go call people..

349
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,680
Fire! Fire!

350
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,800
Fire! Hurry!

351
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,680
What's happening?

352
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,480
Fire!

353
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,240
Fire! Fire!

354
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,600
Help! We need help here!

355
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,200
Fire!

356
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:48,840
Where's on fire?

357
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,280
Quickly send help! The kitchen is on fire!

358
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,080
The kichen is on fire!

359
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:51,960
The kitchen!

360
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,640
Fire! Fire!

361
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,720
Fire! Fire!

362
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,720
Quickly help!

363
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,640
Fire! Fire!

364
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,840
Help!

365
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,840
Here. Here.

366
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,720
Hurry up!

367
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,400
Fire! Fire!

368
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,840
Quickly, some help here!

369
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,840
Fire!

370
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,680
Put out the fire!

371
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,120
Where are the items?

372
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,720
Take this for your spending.

373
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,800
Where's the thing that you promised to tell me?

374
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,480
So, she has escaped?

375
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:12,880
Yes.

376
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,360
But she must have connived with someone inside.

377
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,320
Because of the fire,

378
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,120
everyone wasn't in their post.

379
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,080
It's hard to investigate.

380
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,920
That evil woman won't leave the capital.

381
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,720
You must meticulously investigate,

382
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,280
especially the members of the House of Wang.

383
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,000
You must send people to monitor each one of them.

384
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,360
She probably won't go back to the House of Kang.

385
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,480
But she has a son who's a bit filial.

386
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,160
Send someone to follow him too.

387
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,600
Yes. I'll go handle it now.

388
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,960
I was too negligent.

389
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,080
I should have sent Sir Second Tu

390
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,120
to guard her in our house.

391
00:21:53,427 --> 00:21:54,320
I shouldn't have let people there

392
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,080
to guard her.

393
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,760
Even if you want to let Sir Second Tu be involved,

394
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,360
the Sheng Family won't agree to it.

395
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,680
This is troublesome then.

396
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,480
The official document has been released.

397
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,600
If the day comes

398
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,440
and she's still not found,

399
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,440
it will be hard to explain things to the palace prison.

400
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,760
The matter about the palace prison is actually easy to deal with.

401
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,760
But releasing an evil woman like that outside

402
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,240
is like releasing a poisonous snake into the underbrush.

403
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,960
There's only a forever thief,

404
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,880
no forever guarding against a thief.

405
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,200
I fear that our future days

406
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,240
won't be comfortable.

407
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,240
Let's just be careful in our every step.

408
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,120
Maybe, in a few days,

409
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,400
Sir Second Tu will be able to capture her.

410
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,160
Big Madam.

411
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,760
Have you sent the items out?

412
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,680
I have.

413
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,560
Did she go to Big Madam Qin's house?

414
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,720
I personally saw her enter the Gu Manor.

415
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,720
At the start, no one recognized her,

416
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,600
hence, didn't mind her.

417
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,480
She then took some gold from the bag we gave her

418
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,840
and stuffed them with it.

419
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,120
Guess what?

420
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,080
A person immediately informed the people inside.

421
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,279
In half an hour,

422
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,520
someone came out to especially welcome her and even

423
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,800
brought a fan to cover her face.

424
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,560
Did she tell you everything?

425
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,200
She did.

426
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,760
Let me guess.

427
00:23:40,426 --> 00:23:41,600
Someone must have poisoned

428
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,840
that devout old woman in Shou'an Hall.

429
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,920
However, she didn't die from it

430
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,880
and this evil scheme instead got found out by Minglan.

431
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,840
It must be that Madam Kang's doing,

432
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,640
hence, she got locked up.

433
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,480
Did she tell you that

434
00:23:57,751 --> 00:23:59,200
it was Wang Ruofu who did it?

435
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,920
Big Madam,

436
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,960
it's as if you personally heard it.

437
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,040
She indeed said it that way.

438
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,280
She even claimed that

439
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,280
it was Big Madam Wang of our manor

440
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,560
that poisoned the Old Madam

441
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,840
and then framed her.

442
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,040
That's why, she suffered this unexpected misfortune.

443
00:24:15,688 --> 00:24:17,720
The Wang Ruofu from our house

444
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,240
may look good on the outside, but is actually useless inside.

445
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,280
If she dares to do these unremittingly evil things,

446
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,400
my mother and I would have died long ago.

447
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,920
Will things even progressed to this state?

448
00:24:27,684 --> 00:24:29,080
That Madam Kang...

449
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,800
She did it,

450
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,120
yet she had to frame it on someone else.

451
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,240
She thinks I'm stupid?

452
00:24:36,778 --> 00:24:37,698
Big Madam,

453
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,240
since you've guessed it correctly from the start,

454
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,240
why then must you waste so much money to get her out?

455
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,680
I did that not for her,

456
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,040
but for me.

457
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,880
I just want her to feel that

458
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,080
she has my weakness in her hands,

459
00:24:50,963 --> 00:24:51,843
that she was able to control me.

460
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,400
But if that woman is that useful,

461
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,240
why didn't we just take her into our own hands

462
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,520
and had to send her to that stepmother of Marquis Gu?

463
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,640
Isn't that freely giving her a weapon?

464
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,560
You are really an idiot.

465
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,320
You think that

466
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,000
a person like that will peacefully

467
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,760
be a guest strategist in your manor?

468
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,360
That woman is harboring grudges and evil intentions.

469
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,160
She surely will incite a bloody storm.

470
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,760
Regardless,

471
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,920
she surely will attack Sheng Minglan.

472
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,880
Why must I leave a weapon in my hands

473
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,120
and let others see it?

474
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,920
Of course, we should be handing this knife

475
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,320
to a more powerful fighter,

476
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,000
so its use can be maximized.

477
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,160
Husband is back.

478
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,400
Leave.

479
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,840
Yes.

480
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,120
Master.

481
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,880
People from the House of Wang is here.

482
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,240
Why did they come?

483
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,497
I didn't go to look for them,

484
00:26:34,623 --> 00:26:36,200
and they instead came to see me?

485
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,857
Go tell them to all leave!

486
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,040
Yes.

487
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,200
Wait!

488
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,840
How come it got burned down like this?

489
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,160
What's the condition of my little sister?

490
00:27:09,597 --> 00:27:11,037
Where did you transfer her?

491
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,280
Brother-in-law,

492
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,320
Since I recognised your House,

493
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,000
I've always admired you.

494
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,185
I really didn't expect

495
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,538
that the House of Wang now will act

496
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,200
in this manner.

497
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,120
No, you...

498
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,160
If your family wants to save her,

499
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,360
why didn't you just discuss it with us?

500
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,720
Must you use such a despicable method?

501
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,440
You!

502
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,760
and burn my house?

503
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,000
This.

504
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,840
Fortunately, my ancestors blessed us.

505
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,280
Even though there were some people injured,

506
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,040
no one died.

507
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,040
Or else, this would have been some life debt.

508
00:27:55,629 --> 00:27:56,449
Brother-in-law,

509
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,956
you've learned so many Confucian principles.

510
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,640
Did you just place them all inside your house of misdeeds?

511
00:28:02,496 --> 00:28:04,006
Are you dizzy from the extreme heat?

512
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,280
I heard that your house was on fire.

513
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,360
I was ordered by my mother

514
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,600
to come here and offer comforting words.

515
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,200
I'm here to visit my little sister.

516
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,560
You're here to look for your little sister?

517
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,840
Look at how it got burned down.

518
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,400
Isn't she now alive

519
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,760
and well staying in your House?

520
00:28:26,013 --> 00:28:27,600
You even came here to look for her?

521
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,960
So funny.

522
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,040
You're saying

523
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,760
that our Wang Family came here to start this fire

524
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,400
just to save a person?

525
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,680
Wait. Wait.

526
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,440
What you mean is my little sister

527
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,520
isn't inside your manor anymore?

528
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,840
You are so muddled.

529
00:28:46,715 --> 00:28:48,316
If it was really my Wang Family

530
00:28:48,503 --> 00:28:49,960
who set this fire to save her,

531
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,480
why would I come here today

532
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,440
to make a fuss about this?

533
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,480
At this time,

534
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:57,080
I should be at home thinking about

535
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,560
how to settle my sister down.

536
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,840
Do you believe him?

537
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,240
Second encountered another assassination attempt in the south.

538
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,280
The ceramic jar shatters while not yet far from the well.

539
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,001
It can't be helped for a general

540
00:29:39,001 --> 00:29:40,920
to die in the front line.

541
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,600
Big Madam Wang is here.

542
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,640
Big Madam Wang,

543
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,480
I heard that

544
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,320
the House of Wang

545
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,600
has already visited the Sheng Manor.

546
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:14,200
Should I also send people to inform Old Madam Wang

547
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:15,320
that you're here?

548
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,320
Good sister,

549
00:30:18,528 --> 00:30:19,720
do you dislike me

550
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,030
and don't want me to stay here anymore?

551
00:30:22,093 --> 00:30:23,093
Little sister,

552
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,200
look at what you're saying.

553
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,720
I so want for you

554
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,480
to stay here forever.

555
00:30:28,861 --> 00:30:31,021
This way, I won't be lonely anymore.

556
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,760
Okay.

557
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,120
With those words,

558
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,000
I'm at ease.

559
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,480
No need to worry about my family matters.

560
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,800
Once I've handled everything well,

561
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,040
I then can go home

562
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,040
in an open and grand manner, not inviting any dislike.

563
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,120
I surely will listen to you

564
00:30:52,252 --> 00:30:53,640
when it comes to your family matters.

565
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,272
You should just tell me again

566
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,040
how a fire broke out in the Sheng Manor

567
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,040
and how you were able to escape.

568
00:31:12,391 --> 00:31:15,480
You really have not left your house and traveled far all your life.

569
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,480
You're so interested in listening to little things like that.

570
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,040
Urgent news from 400 miles!

571
00:31:35,294 --> 00:31:37,094
Prince Huan and his company encountered an assassination attempt!

572
00:31:37,383 --> 00:31:39,060
I was especially ordered to report it to the palace!

573
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,680
Hurry! Open the city gates!

574
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,360
Open the city gates!

575
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,160
Don't panic.

576
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,320
Be careful of your child.

577
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,880
Second Brother!

578
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,240
Second Brother!

579
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,920
You...

580
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:17,880
Why are you here?

581
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,280
Especially you.

582
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,480
You should be careful at all times now.

583
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,920
Why did you come to the city outskirt to welcome me?

584
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,920
Sixth Little Sister is missing Marquis Gu.

585
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,840
By seeing you earlier,

586
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,640
she can ask about the return of Marquis Gu earlier.

587
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,160
We have official matters to finish and are duty-bound.

588
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,720
There surely will be a set return date.

589
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,640
Let's talk at home.

590
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,720
Go home.

591
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,400
Let's go home, sit down first,

592
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,360
and talk about this slowly.

593
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,240
Hurry.

594
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,120
While pregnant,

595
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,240
you still went in the city outskirt to welcome me.

596
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,480
Did you hear something?

597
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,440
I went to the palace to greet the empress

598
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,200
and heard those palace maids talking.

599
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,320
They said that he....

600
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,240
he was outside,

601
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,200
and got hurt.

602
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,960
Nonsense!

603
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,240
Really?

604
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,240
Of course, I'm saying the truth.

605
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:32,240
It's just that the salt affairs are too complicated.

606
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,480
The House of Bai also won't stop

607
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,520
contradicting us.

608
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,360
Zhonghuai...

609
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,560
Leave. Leave.

610
00:33:44,209 --> 00:33:46,440
Zhonghuai is also there for military reasons.

611
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,480
He has to set up and handle military camps and bailiffs.

612
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,440
He still have a lot of things to handle

613
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,840
regarding the local constabulary and salt merchants,

614
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,800
hence, he didn't return with me.

615
00:33:57,531 --> 00:33:58,920
It's not for other matters.

616
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,520
Even a difficult task like that,

617
00:34:10,177 --> 00:34:11,560
we were able to do it.

618
00:34:12,441 --> 00:34:13,481
Everything is fine.

619
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,920
Zhonghuai also asked me to bring you a message.

620
00:34:21,535 --> 00:34:24,140
He would be back in a few days.

621
00:34:25,601 --> 00:34:27,201
He said that you should not get involved with

622
00:34:27,527 --> 00:34:28,607
the matter of your Maternal Aunt Kang's escape.

623
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,360
Just guard your manor well

624
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,880
and nurse your health.

625
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,400
Just wait for his return before handling anything.

626
00:34:34,982 --> 00:34:35,382
Okay.

627
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,040
Older Brother, you still have to

628
00:34:37,221 --> 00:34:38,680
go to the morning court tomorrow to report.

629
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,462
Then I...won't disturb you anymore.

630
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:56,240
Is he really not injured?

631
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,400
You don't believe in my words too?

632
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,840
Go back.

633
00:35:03,752 --> 00:35:05,178
I also don't know

634
00:35:05,553 --> 00:35:07,393
why but I kept having nightmares lately.

635
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,160
Just go home now.

636
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,240
The adjacent courtyard is now in a big mess.

637
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,960
Nanny Huang couldn't even spare any free time.

638
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,440
I also heard of it.

639
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,960
Should we tell this to Miss Cuiwei?

640
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,760
It's better to not meddle in such a huge matter.

641
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:35,960
Don't know if it's true or not.

642
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,240
It most likely is real.

643
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,520
If not,

644
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,600
why would the adjacent courtyard be in such a mess?

645
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,467
If marquis really died for blocking an arrow to save Prince Huan,

646
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,640
with such a huge manor like us,

647
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,400
with so many people,

648
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,560
we will really be floating and withering.

649
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,080
What are you two saying?

650
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,680
Slow down.

651
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,920
What are you two talking about?

652
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,520
Slow down.

653
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,160
What?

654
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,400
When did marquis blocked an arrow?

655
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,960
Who said that?

656
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,694
Slow down.

657
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,280
Come over and help!

658
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,240
Say it.

659
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,360
I...also didn't hear it properly.

660
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,720
Maybe, it's just false rumors.

661
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,720
I...didn't say anything.

662
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,920
I didn't say anything.

663
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,800
You told me quickly!

664
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,560
Tell me what happened to my marquis husband.

665
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,320
I didn't say anything.

666
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,800
I can insist.

667
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,640
I didn't say anything.

668
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:25,920
Are you alright?

669
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,280
Big Madam,

670
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:30,880
she's giving birth.

671
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,640
The woman from that house is giving birth.

672
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,560
She indeed went into preterm labor.

673
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,800
Yes.

674
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,160
I even thought those gossips won't reach her.

675
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,480
Even the heaven is on your side.

676
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,480
That Sheng Minglan will be passing through the preterm labor pass.

677
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,360
Let's go send her off along the way.

678
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,680
Push hard.

679
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,470
Big Madam, push hard.

680
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,600
Big Madam, drink some water.

681
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,720
Slowly.

682
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,200
The house must be grounded.

683
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,200
Don't panic.

684
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:38,880
Don't leak any news.

685
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,800
Okay.

686
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,720
Push hard.

687
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,920
How is my marquis husband?

688
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:43,800
Don't worry.

689
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,120
I've asked and marquis is fine.

690
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Big Madam,

691
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,267
stop thinking about those.

692
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:48,960
Stabilize your breathing.

693
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,600
Push hard! Push hard!

694
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:53,880
Rest for a while.

695
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,408
Sit down.

696
00:37:54,408 --> 00:37:55,000
Rest for a while.

697
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:55,960
Big Madam, endure it.

698
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,200
Don't use up all your energy.

699
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,000
Rest for a while.

700
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,000
Rest for a while more.

701
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:31,960
Big Madam!

702
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,440
It's fine. It's fine.

703
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,320
Madam Sheng is currently safely in labor.

704
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,560
Amitabha...

705
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,240
Really never thought that

706
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,360
after slipping and going into preterm labor,

707
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,920
she's still able to successfully give birth.

708
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:54,640
Yes.

709
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,280
Quickly go and light the prayer lanterns

710
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,160
we've prepared.

711
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,240
She's really fine?

712
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,800
You might have heard it wrong.

713
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,240
This is a great joyous news

714
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,680
that is blessed by Bodhisattva and by our ancestors.

715
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,960
How could I have heard it wrong?

716
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,000
I'm sure of it.

717
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,320
You even are sending out sky lanterns

718
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,320
to pray for blessings for them?

719
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,800
No matter how kind you are to curry their favor,

720
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,680
they will still not give you any importance.

721
00:39:21,644 --> 00:39:22,600
Big Madam,

722
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,609
we're all women.

723
00:39:24,871 --> 00:39:26,210
We know that giving birth is like taking a trip

724
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:27,880
to the doors of death.

725
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,320
Isn't releasing sky lanterns and praying for blessings

726
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,760
just something that a mother-in-law like me should do?

727
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,400
If a legitimate son comes out,

728
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,840
what good days can you have?

729
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,200
Legitimate son?

730
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,840
He then would be the glorious pride of our whole marquis manor.

731
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,360
It will also make Second happy.

732
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,360
As long as Second is happy,

733
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,680
he then can forgive your sins.

734
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,480
What a joke.

735
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,680
The House of Wang is my maiden house,

736
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,720
the House of Kang is my husband's house.

737
00:39:57,081 --> 00:39:58,400
All those defended me.

738
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,920
Only that little bitch Sheng Minglan wanted me to die.

739
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,640
If she's dead

740
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,080
and your Second marries another one,

741
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,120
I will naturally be alright.

742
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,360
Won't your days also be better?

743
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,480
You're just being too agitated

744
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,760
and is getting hysterical.

745
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,640
Okay. Just be your good person!

746
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,880
She really was able to peacefully

747
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:31,880
and smoothly deliver her child?

748
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,000
Yes.

749
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,160
I'm unable to get any news from the main room, Jiaxi House.

750
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,320
But looking at how the kitchen and carriage

751
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,160
are all calm and in order,

752
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,240
it must be a safe delivery.

753
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,520
But,

754
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,240
I've already sent the sky lanterns out.

755
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,160
What are you laughing about?

756
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,160
Setting a fire to create a confusion

757
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,680
was initially an idea of Sheng Fourth Miss.

758
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,880
Now, we've used it on Sixth Miss.

759
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,960
Isn't this some ironic misfortune?

760
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,080
Isn't it quite funny?

761
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,800
This fire tonight

762
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,840
is really so relaxing.

763
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,880
Your Big Madam is really too soft.

764
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,240
Other people are already riding above her

765
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,400
and she's still releasing sky lanterns to pray for blessings?

766
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,840
Doesn't she know that everyone in this world bullies the kind

767
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,840
and fears the evil,

768
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,880
afraid of might and never the gracious ones?

769
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,560
What can our Big Madam do?

770
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,000
The other person is in labor.

771
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,160
She can't really go there and gossip, right?

772
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,360
I even went to deliver her some fragrance pouch.

773
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,120
You've been there?

774
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:02,378
I have been there for a few times.

775
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:03,799
I know how to go there even in the dark.

776
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,320
Big Madam, push down hard.

777
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,080
It won't come out...

778
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,440
Hold your breath. Push hard.

779
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,480
Exert more effort.

780
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,804
Fire! Fire!

781
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,800
What happened?!

782
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,720
What's going on?!

783
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,160
The courtyard outside is on fire!

784
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,120
Where did it start?

785
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,000
I don't know.

786
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:45,760
Nanny,

787
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,046
can the Big Madam be moved right now?

788
00:42:47,046 --> 00:42:48,120
She can't!

789
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,320
The child is coming out.

790
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,360
She's in labor.

791
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,000
How long will it take?

792
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:53,840
I can't be sure.

793
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,400
Who can be sure about that?!

794
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,120
Do your best to put out the fire!

795
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,000
Yes.

796
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,520
Hurry up! Hurry up!

797
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,960
Hurry! Be careful of your safety, everyone!

798
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,120
This...

799
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:14,960
Big Madam, drink some water.

800
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,720
Madam, get up.

801
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,600
Put on more effort.

802
00:43:31,956 --> 00:43:32,916
What's going on outside?

803
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:35,680
It's nothing.

804
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:36,800
It's too dark outside.

805
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,560
I told them to add more lanterns.

806
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:40,640
It's fine, Big Madam.

807
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,720
Come, let's continue.

808
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,840
Hold your breath.

809
00:43:47,479 --> 00:43:48,119
Push hard!
