00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,922
Episode 30

3
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,175
This noble house is so generous.

4
00:01:09,181 --> 00:01:11,100
Nothing tangible is yet in sight,

5
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,222
and they already sent

6
00:01:12,222 --> 00:01:13,862
so many valuable treasures over.

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,300
If she gets married into that house,

8
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,500
will her eating bowls and plates

9
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,000
all be made of gold?

10
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,302
Even Fan House has golden dishes,

11
00:01:24,302 --> 00:01:26,700
let alone an aristocrat's house?

12
00:01:26,702 --> 00:01:28,175
If not because you are so useless,

13
00:01:28,175 --> 00:01:29,700
afraid of hardship and difficulties,

14
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,862
all the wealth and splendor

15
00:01:30,862 --> 00:01:32,001
of the Count's manor would be yours.

16
00:01:33,022 --> 00:01:34,431
I just don't care about it,

17
00:01:34,431 --> 00:01:35,822
hence, I yielded it to Minglan.

18
00:01:36,822 --> 00:01:38,022
Moreover

19
00:01:38,022 --> 00:01:39,742
I don't see her being happy now.

20
00:01:40,222 --> 00:01:41,742
Eldest Sister is a very smart woman,

21
00:01:41,742 --> 00:01:43,742
yet she had to suffer inside a count's house.

22
00:01:44,142 --> 00:01:45,019
Let alone a concubine-born daughter

23
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:45,742
getting married into a count's house.

24
00:01:46,742 --> 00:01:47,622
In the future,

25
00:01:47,622 --> 00:01:49,302
she will even be unable to cry, even if she wants to.

26
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,822
I'm also letting her have the hardships.

27
00:01:52,022 --> 00:01:53,222
Just continue to be stubborn.

28
00:01:57,982 --> 00:01:58,709
Big Madam,

29
00:01:59,222 --> 00:02:00,262
Sixth Miss said that

30
00:02:00,302 --> 00:02:01,102
Big Madam Wu

31
00:02:01,102 --> 00:02:02,782
has sent people to deliver her some items.

32
00:02:03,142 --> 00:02:04,697
She saw osmanthus oil among them

33
00:02:04,697 --> 00:02:05,629
and remembered that Fifth Miss

34
00:02:05,629 --> 00:02:07,324
loved to use this on her hair.

35
00:02:07,324 --> 00:02:09,062
She then asked Xiaotao to deliver it to here.

36
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,235
I indeed usually use osmanthus oil

37
00:02:11,235 --> 00:02:12,275
to nourish my hair.

38
00:02:12,622 --> 00:02:13,422
This one from a noble house surely is

39
00:02:13,422 --> 00:02:14,302
of better quality

40
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:14,982
than the one I usually use.

41
00:02:15,622 --> 00:02:16,121
Xique,

42
00:02:16,121 --> 00:02:17,062
let's go give it a try.

43
00:02:20,462 --> 00:02:22,364
After just coming from the manor of Big Madam Wu,

44
00:02:23,262 --> 00:02:23,924
she's still sending objects

45
00:02:23,924 --> 00:02:24,662
even if it's already this late.

46
00:02:27,062 --> 00:02:28,222
What items did Sixth Miss

47
00:02:28,222 --> 00:02:29,222
gift to Linqi Pavilion?

48
00:02:29,222 --> 00:02:30,354
She did send something.

49
00:02:30,354 --> 00:02:32,200
Danju was the one who delivered them.

50
00:02:32,222 --> 00:02:33,905
I just don't know what they were.

51
00:02:34,542 --> 00:02:35,422
No matter what she has sent,

52
00:02:37,182 --> 00:02:38,973
as long as it won't be in the way of my Rulan,

53
00:02:38,973 --> 00:02:39,933
I'm fine with everything.

54
00:02:40,822 --> 00:02:41,902
If she wants to fight with Linqi Pavilion,

55
00:02:41,942 --> 00:02:42,681
just let her.

56
00:02:42,681 --> 00:02:43,601
Let's just enjoy watching.

57
00:02:50,862 --> 00:02:51,462
Miss!

58
00:02:52,742 --> 00:02:53,701
Miss,

59
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:54,902
Sixth Miss ordered her servant

60
00:02:54,902 --> 00:02:56,100
to deliver you some items.

61
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,071
She said that Big Madam Wu

62
00:02:58,071 --> 00:02:59,542
gifted her a bunch of leather pieces.

63
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,000
She won't be able to wear so much,

64
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,320
so she especially had two delivered to you.

65
00:03:05,302 --> 00:03:06,262
I'm not a beggar!

66
00:03:06,262 --> 00:03:07,382
I don't need her alms!

67
00:03:14,302 --> 00:03:15,102
Get out!

68
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,222
What rotten items!

69
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,142
They even dared to gift them to our courtyard?

70
00:03:26,142 --> 00:03:27,293
Isn't this just some rotten leather?

71
00:03:27,422 --> 00:03:28,222
The Master buys

72
00:03:28,222 --> 00:03:29,382
animal skins for the Mistress

73
00:03:29,382 --> 00:03:30,396
and Miss every winter.

74
00:03:30,902 --> 00:03:31,982
Such bad luck!

75
00:03:32,822 --> 00:03:33,622
What are you doing!

76
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,582
Sixth Miss was kind enough

77
00:03:38,582 --> 00:03:39,782
to give you gifts,

78
00:03:39,782 --> 00:03:41,022
and you're this heartless.

79
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,752
If not because I was wiping my shoes in the corner,

80
00:03:42,752 --> 00:03:43,782
I almost got tricked by you.

81
00:03:43,822 --> 00:03:44,622
Come on.

82
00:03:44,622 --> 00:03:46,062
Who doesn't know that your Miss

83
00:03:46,197 --> 00:03:46,742
is just pretending

84
00:03:46,742 --> 00:03:47,662
to be a good sister,

85
00:03:47,662 --> 00:03:48,662
while she's holding

86
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:49,982
a huge grudge deep inside?

87
00:03:50,302 --> 00:03:51,022
Who are you fooling?

88
00:03:51,262 --> 00:03:52,622
Isn't that just a bunch of rotten animal skins?

89
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:53,942
So what if you saw me

90
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,062
throwing them away?

91
00:03:55,422 --> 00:03:55,999
Are you planning to go to the rooms

92
00:03:55,999 --> 00:03:56,622
of Big Madam and the Master

93
00:03:56,622 --> 00:03:57,742
to tell them off

94
00:03:57,742 --> 00:03:58,702
about us?

95
00:03:59,102 --> 00:03:59,742
Even if you do,

96
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,382
you won't get any good from it.

97
00:04:01,622 --> 00:04:02,382
Rotten animal skins?

98
00:04:03,022 --> 00:04:03,862
You better look at it carefully.

99
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:06,302
All of these are high-quality items

100
00:04:06,302 --> 00:04:07,622
that are worth a lot!

101
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,655
You all didn't see it.

102
00:04:09,655 --> 00:04:11,000
Today in the Count Yongchang Manor,

103
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,822
that Countess kept holding onto our Miss

104
00:04:11,822 --> 00:04:12,862
and wouldn't let her hand go.

105
00:04:13,022 --> 00:04:14,302
and wouldn't let her hand go.

106
00:04:14,622 --> 00:04:15,382
She even especially called Young Master Liang

107
00:04:15,382 --> 00:04:16,574
to come out and see her.

108
00:04:16,574 --> 00:04:17,702
We were already leaving

109
00:04:17,702 --> 00:04:18,382
when she still chased after us

110
00:04:18,382 --> 00:04:19,742
to gift a cart full of valuables.

111
00:04:19,862 --> 00:04:20,942
That's what you call real ability.

112
00:04:21,342 --> 00:04:22,622
I guess

113
00:04:22,622 --> 00:04:23,422
the very small amount of items

114
00:04:23,422 --> 00:04:24,600
that Sixth Miss gave to you

115
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,574
would even be enough to fund your Linqi Pavilion

116
00:04:25,574 --> 00:04:26,614
for six months.

117
00:04:27,402 --> 00:04:28,707
You Mucang Pagoda people

118
00:04:28,707 --> 00:04:29,622
could have just stayed arrogant

119
00:04:29,622 --> 00:04:30,262
in your own place!

120
00:04:30,502 --> 00:04:31,862
You even dared to act arrogantly in my place?

121
00:04:32,102 --> 00:04:33,662
Fourth Miss, you were right to lecture me.

122
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:36,203
But I'm afraid that the Fourth Miss

123
00:04:36,203 --> 00:04:37,462
can only display this haughty bearing

124
00:04:37,462 --> 00:04:38,465
here in your courtyard.

125
00:04:38,782 --> 00:04:39,862
Once you leave this courtyard,

126
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:40,724
leave the house,

127
00:04:40,942 --> 00:04:41,942
you are the one who always

128
00:04:42,004 --> 00:04:43,022
swallow insult and humiliation silently,

129
00:04:43,022 --> 00:04:44,022
being submissive and obedient.

130
00:04:44,262 --> 00:04:45,462
In the past, it was Princess Pingning.

131
00:04:45,622 --> 00:04:46,982
Now, it's Big Madam Wu, the Countess.

132
00:04:47,462 --> 00:04:48,422
You talk with them with a smile

133
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:49,662
plastered on your face all the time.

134
00:04:49,882 --> 00:04:51,022
This time,

135
00:04:51,022 --> 00:04:51,742
you're acting like a master.

136
00:04:51,982 --> 00:04:52,742
But our Sixth Miss

137
00:04:52,742 --> 00:04:53,483
is different,

138
00:04:53,662 --> 00:04:55,182
Those noble counts' and marquis' Madams

139
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:56,542
all praised our Sixth Miss

140
00:04:56,542 --> 00:04:57,120
as having an imposing manner that's

141
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,742
better than most legitimate daughters.

142
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,262
All are competing to invite her for some fun.

143
00:04:59,622 --> 00:05:00,622
Comparing the two of you,

144
00:05:00,902 --> 00:05:02,222
Miss, I fear that you will never catch up

145
00:05:02,222 --> 00:05:03,742
with our Miss even if you keep fawning.

146
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,022
You...

147
00:05:06,022 --> 00:05:07,422
dare to say harsh words to me?

148
00:05:07,902 --> 00:05:08,582
Servant...

149
00:05:08,902 --> 00:05:09,822
Servant!

150
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:11,222
Quickly tie her up,

151
00:05:11,502 --> 00:05:12,742
and sell her off tomorrow!

152
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,942
Who dares to?

153
00:05:14,142 --> 00:05:14,862
I'm a maidservant

154
00:05:14,862 --> 00:05:16,090
sent to Sixth Miss by Old Madam.

155
00:05:16,262 --> 00:05:17,542
Even if you want to sell me out,

156
00:05:17,888 --> 00:05:18,622
you still have to ask Old Madam

157
00:05:18,622 --> 00:05:19,699
to give you my selling contract.

158
00:05:20,142 --> 00:05:21,862
At that time,

159
00:05:21,862 --> 00:05:22,600
let's reason it out in front of her.

160
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,182
Who was the first one who said harsh words?

161
00:05:24,382 --> 00:05:26,022
Who was the one in the wrong here?

162
00:05:27,622 --> 00:05:28,502
With such good items,

163
00:05:29,268 --> 00:05:30,508
it's better to give them to beggars

164
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,622
than being spoiled by people

165
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,331
who don't know how to appreciate them.

166
00:05:35,782 --> 00:05:36,902
Damn you, you lowly servant!

167
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,382
You dare insult me

168
00:05:38,382 --> 00:05:39,422
right inside of my own house!

169
00:05:39,702 --> 00:05:40,582
Let me see

170
00:05:40,582 --> 00:05:41,302
how arrogant

171
00:05:41,302 --> 00:05:42,262
your Sixth Miss is!

172
00:05:56,342 --> 00:05:58,182
You lowly bitch!

173
00:05:58,622 --> 00:05:59,259
Keep one eye on the bowl

174
00:05:59,259 --> 00:05:59,982
and the other on the pan!

175
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,302
You even dared to

176
00:06:01,302 --> 00:06:02,222
send your servant to insult me?

177
00:06:02,902 --> 00:06:03,902
Fourth Miss,

178
00:06:04,022 --> 00:06:04,782
what's going on?

179
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:05,692
Miss!

180
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:07,302
Fourth Miss complained that

181
00:06:07,302 --> 00:06:08,422
the leather pieces we gave her are of poor quality!

182
00:06:08,742 --> 00:06:10,022
She slapped me,

183
00:06:10,022 --> 00:06:11,222
and even wants to sell me off!

184
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:12,102
You..!

185
00:06:12,742 --> 00:06:13,502
Fourth Sister,

186
00:06:13,702 --> 00:06:14,782
you really have blamed me wrongly.

187
00:06:14,822 --> 00:06:15,942
This is...

188
00:06:15,955 --> 00:06:17,062
the best ones I picked

189
00:06:17,062 --> 00:06:17,965
and gave them to you.

190
00:06:18,142 --> 00:06:19,142
Stop pretending!

191
00:06:19,702 --> 00:06:20,822
Don't think that because the Countess

192
00:06:20,822 --> 00:06:21,582
likes you that

193
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:22,191
you can really be married off

194
00:06:22,191 --> 00:06:22,802
into an aristocratic family!

195
00:06:23,062 --> 00:06:23,704
Let me tell you that if one's virtue

196
00:06:23,704 --> 00:06:24,155
doesn't fit one's position

197
00:06:24,155 --> 00:06:25,964
you surely will suffer a disaster.

198
00:06:26,182 --> 00:06:27,382
Be careful of getting into trouble,

199
00:06:27,582 --> 00:06:28,662
and dragging our whole family down with you!

200
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,262
So Sister is angry

201
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:37,302
because of this matter.

202
00:06:38,422 --> 00:06:39,182
Then from now on

203
00:06:39,422 --> 00:06:41,102
if there are any polo or scholarly gatherings,

204
00:06:42,022 --> 00:06:43,982
I'll ask Big Madam Wu

205
00:06:43,982 --> 00:06:44,943
to send you

206
00:06:44,943 --> 00:06:46,143
an invitation too.

207
00:06:46,942 --> 00:06:47,702
The Countess follows

208
00:06:47,702 --> 00:06:48,742
my every request.

209
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:50,262
It's just a matter of asking.

210
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,782
You lowly bitch!

211
00:06:51,902 --> 00:06:53,502
You still dare to show off right in front of me!

212
00:06:54,222 --> 00:06:55,102
How dare you to pretend then!

213
00:06:55,222 --> 00:06:55,740
Careful, Miss!

214
00:06:55,862 --> 00:06:56,422
How dare you!

215
00:06:58,022 --> 00:06:58,702
Fourth Miss!

216
00:06:59,662 --> 00:07:00,422
How dare

217
00:07:00,582 --> 00:07:01,422
you to pretend!

218
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:02,262
Miss, be careful! Miss!

219
00:07:02,348 --> 00:07:03,382
I'm going to destroy your face!

220
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:03,942
MIiss！

221
00:07:03,942 --> 00:07:04,462
Get lost!

222
00:07:04,622 --> 00:07:05,662
Let's see if the House of Liang

223
00:07:06,238 --> 00:07:07,118
will still want you!

224
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:07,731
Stop!

225
00:07:08,382 --> 00:07:08,942
All of you, stop!

226
00:07:10,302 --> 00:07:10,822
Fourth Miss is trying to

227
00:07:10,822 --> 00:07:12,142
kill our Sixth Miss!

228
00:07:18,382 --> 00:07:19,142
Miss!

229
00:07:19,822 --> 00:07:21,302
Quickly assist your Miss up.

230
00:07:21,342 --> 00:07:21,742
yes

231
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:23,382
Miss.

232
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:24,342
Miss.

233
00:07:30,102 --> 00:07:31,062
You got hit like that?

234
00:07:32,502 --> 00:07:33,382
Quickly assist Sixth Miss away

235
00:07:33,382 --> 00:07:34,331
and find a doctor!

236
00:07:34,502 --> 00:07:35,142
Yes.

237
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:36,091
Miss

238
00:07:56,582 --> 00:07:57,760
I've already called a doctor.

239
00:07:59,262 --> 00:07:59,982
Miss, endure it a little.

240
00:08:00,302 --> 00:08:01,662
How come you really got wounded by her?

241
00:08:02,822 --> 00:08:03,742
I'm fine.

242
00:08:07,662 --> 00:08:08,942
You go get the medicine.

243
00:08:12,062 --> 00:08:13,062
Are you all made of wood!

244
00:08:14,022 --> 00:08:15,262
Your mistress got hit like that and

245
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:16,102
you didn't even know to pull her away?

246
00:08:18,022 --> 00:08:19,662
We tried but couldn't pull her away.

247
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,342
I don't know where Fourth Miss

248
00:08:21,342 --> 00:08:22,542
got so much strength

249
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,502
that she wanted to kill our Sixth Miss

250
00:08:24,502 --> 00:08:26,422
just for some animal skins!

251
00:08:27,982 --> 00:08:28,942
Bring me the disciplining stick.

252
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:32,142
No. No. No.

253
00:08:32,153 --> 00:08:32,782
Wait!

254
00:08:43,142 --> 00:08:44,662
It was just two sisters arguing.

255
00:08:45,222 --> 00:08:45,862
Big Madam,

256
00:08:45,862 --> 00:08:47,382
why are you hitting people now?

257
00:08:51,102 --> 00:08:52,822
Who do you think you are?

258
00:08:53,022 --> 00:08:54,582
You dare to climb out here and speak?

259
00:08:55,222 --> 00:08:56,582
Are you even allowed to speak here?

260
00:09:01,422 --> 00:09:02,182
I've been in this manor

261
00:09:02,182 --> 00:09:04,182
for so many years.

262
00:09:04,422 --> 00:09:06,022
Now that there is some unfair treatment,

263
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,022
why is Big Madam not

264
00:09:08,022 --> 00:09:09,702
allowing people to speak?

265
00:09:10,262 --> 00:09:11,862
This is the girl you've raised

266
00:09:12,342 --> 00:09:14,022
who was so unruly, quarreled and hit her little sister!

267
00:09:14,182 --> 00:09:15,662
I can't even discipline her for it!

268
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:18,742
Just arguing and getting a bit hitting.

269
00:09:19,062 --> 00:09:21,022
Every house has have siblings fighting like that.

270
00:09:22,022 --> 00:09:23,222
If Big Madam is mad about it,

271
00:09:23,582 --> 00:09:24,822
you can just scold each of them.

272
00:09:25,942 --> 00:09:27,062
What do you mean, "scold each of them"?

273
00:09:27,222 --> 00:09:27,902
She almost killed

274
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:28,982
our Sixth Miss!

275
00:09:29,222 --> 00:09:30,742
You think we are all blind?

276
00:09:30,942 --> 00:09:31,862
You lowly servant!

277
00:09:32,422 --> 00:09:33,742
What right do you have to talk here?

278
00:09:34,182 --> 00:09:34,902
That's right!

279
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:36,622
You all are servants of that girl Ming.

280
00:09:36,822 --> 00:09:37,662
You are colluding with her!

281
00:09:38,262 --> 00:09:39,782
How can your words be trusted?

282
00:09:40,662 --> 00:09:42,822
It was that girl Ming who hit me first.

283
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,222
I just fought back.

284
00:09:47,862 --> 00:09:48,982
Nanny Fang is here!

285
00:09:59,662 --> 00:10:01,304
Old Madam heard that something happened here

286
00:10:01,304 --> 00:10:02,662
and asked me to come take a look.

287
00:10:03,342 --> 00:10:04,782
Big Madam, you've tried hard to dealt with it.

288
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:05,982
Have Nanny Liu escort you

289
00:10:05,982 --> 00:10:07,258
back to rest first.

290
00:10:10,822 --> 00:10:12,022
I'm the steward of the whole house!

291
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:15,982
Big Madam,

292
00:10:16,702 --> 00:10:18,062
you almost fainted earlier from extreme anger.

293
00:10:18,302 --> 00:10:19,302
Let's go back first to rest,

294
00:10:19,382 --> 00:10:20,262
then return to scold these girls.

295
00:10:29,342 --> 00:10:30,942
It's still Old Madam

296
00:10:30,942 --> 00:10:32,542
that's most sensible.

297
00:10:33,622 --> 00:10:34,982
Mo, quickly get up.

298
00:10:36,662 --> 00:10:38,022
Thank Nanny Fang

299
00:10:38,022 --> 00:10:39,302
and Old Madam.

300
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:42,086
I'm grateful to Nanny Fang for saving me.

301
00:10:42,662 --> 00:10:44,422
Please extend my greetings to Old Madam.

302
00:10:46,942 --> 00:10:47,782
Please wait.

303
00:10:49,622 --> 00:10:50,622
Fourth Miss,

304
00:10:50,622 --> 00:10:52,222
just stay in Old Madam's room to be interrogated.

305
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:56,862
Nanny Fang, why must you do this?

306
00:10:58,382 --> 00:10:59,662
If she goes far from our eyes

307
00:11:00,022 --> 00:11:01,022
and she develops

308
00:11:01,022 --> 00:11:02,102
any wound in her body,

309
00:11:02,422 --> 00:11:04,022
it would be hard to explain it by then.

310
00:11:04,982 --> 00:11:05,782
Servant!

311
00:11:06,302 --> 00:11:07,662
Assist Fourth Miss to go there.

312
00:11:08,302 --> 00:11:08,742
No...

313
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:10,142
Nanny Fang!

314
00:11:18,102 --> 00:11:19,222
Mother.

315
00:11:32,902 --> 00:11:33,502
That Big Madam is

316
00:11:33,502 --> 00:11:34,782
so outspoken.

317
00:11:35,902 --> 00:11:36,942
Always falling into other people's plots.

318
00:11:38,862 --> 00:11:39,742
Don't worry about that, Sixth Miss.

319
00:11:39,902 --> 00:11:40,414
It's better that you

320
00:11:40,414 --> 00:11:41,584
worry about your face more.

321
00:11:41,584 --> 00:11:42,542
It mustn't get destroyed.

322
00:11:51,062 --> 00:11:51,862
Let me see.

323
00:12:01,622 --> 00:12:02,582
Master.

324
00:12:02,782 --> 00:12:03,622
Old Madam said

325
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:04,742
that since you're back,

326
00:12:04,982 --> 00:12:06,302
may you accompany Sixth Miss

327
00:12:06,302 --> 00:12:07,012
to the receiving hall and

328
00:12:07,012 --> 00:12:07,902
have this matter fully clarified.

329
00:12:08,067 --> 00:12:08,326
All right.

330
00:12:10,662 --> 00:12:11,702
This matter indeed has to be clarified.

331
00:12:13,662 --> 00:12:14,342
Let's go.

332
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:23,372
Father, please investigate wisely.

333
00:12:23,863 --> 00:12:25,023
I just had an argument

334
00:12:25,023 --> 00:12:26,222
with Sixth Miss.

335
00:12:27,342 --> 00:12:28,462
Out of a moment of anger,

336
00:12:28,942 --> 00:12:29,622
I didn't notice the intensity with which

337
00:12:29,622 --> 00:12:31,382
I'd been swinging my arms.

338
00:12:32,422 --> 00:12:34,462
I...I didn't mean to do it!

339
00:12:35,262 --> 00:12:36,582
I admit my mistake.

340
00:12:37,342 --> 00:12:38,982
May Father please punish me!

341
00:12:41,102 --> 00:12:41,982
Arguing?

342
00:12:42,022 --> 00:12:43,182
Why must you argue!

343
00:12:45,582 --> 00:12:46,902
Look at what you did to your little sister!

344
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:49,262
What matter is worthy for you

345
00:12:49,262 --> 00:12:50,782
to be this harsh?

346
00:12:54,822 --> 00:12:56,622
I obtained some good leather pieces and wanted to

347
00:12:56,622 --> 00:12:58,622
especially gift them to my older sister.

348
00:12:59,422 --> 00:13:00,542
But I never thought that

349
00:13:00,542 --> 00:13:01,822
she would want to hit me.

350
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:05,182
I couldn't understand why,

351
00:13:06,342 --> 00:13:08,462
but after giving it some thought,

352
00:13:09,182 --> 00:13:10,022
I finally understand it.

353
00:13:11,342 --> 00:13:12,515
I'm afraid that I might have

354
00:13:12,515 --> 00:13:14,170
offended her a few days ago

355
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,662
in the polo matches set up

356
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:16,782
by Big Madam Wu,

357
00:13:17,102 --> 00:13:18,862
that's why this disaster happened.

358
00:13:19,822 --> 00:13:21,062
What nonsense are you saying!

359
00:13:21,502 --> 00:13:22,782
It was clearly your maidservant

360
00:13:22,782 --> 00:13:23,885
that insulted me first!

361
00:13:23,902 --> 00:13:25,782
You even insulted my Little Mother...

362
00:13:26,662 --> 00:13:27,982
and called her a little whore!

363
00:13:28,822 --> 00:13:30,390
That's why

364
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,982
I got angry and hit you.

365
00:13:37,062 --> 00:13:37,902
At such a young age,

366
00:13:38,022 --> 00:13:38,662
how could you

367
00:13:38,662 --> 00:13:39,462
say such a thing?

368
00:13:40,422 --> 00:13:41,142
Father,

369
00:13:41,422 --> 00:13:42,262
you are wise and just.

370
00:13:42,662 --> 00:13:43,306
Those words were spoken

371
00:13:43,306 --> 00:13:44,742
by Fourth Miss

372
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:45,613
when she was chasing and cursing me

373
00:13:45,613 --> 00:13:46,022
in my courtyard!

374
00:13:46,622 --> 00:13:47,779
I never thought that in this world

375
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:49,191
there is a person like Fourth Sister,

376
00:13:49,443 --> 00:13:50,737
who will overturn the truth like that!

377
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:51,582
She dares to blame everything on me

378
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:52,742
right in front of me!

379
00:13:52,822 --> 00:13:53,942
What she said is true.

380
00:13:54,182 --> 00:13:55,702
I've asked the servants of Mucang Pagoda

381
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:56,702
and their stories were all like that.

382
00:13:56,982 --> 00:13:57,662
Master,

383
00:13:58,182 --> 00:13:58,902
the people who told those stories

384
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,222
are the maidservants

385
00:14:00,222 --> 00:14:01,702
of Sixth Miss' Mucang Pagoda.

386
00:14:01,902 --> 00:14:03,542
Of course they will side with their own mistress.

387
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:04,462
Shut up!

388
00:14:08,822 --> 00:14:09,742
Mother, calm down.

389
00:14:12,622 --> 00:14:13,662
Tell the truth.

390
00:14:28,982 --> 00:14:33,262
Fourth Sister bears a grudge for

391
00:14:33,262 --> 00:14:35,422
my throwing mud at her during the polo event,

392
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:39,102
so she came to me to beat me up.

393
00:14:40,022 --> 00:14:42,342
What I said is all true.

394
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:44,342
If I have told any lies,

395
00:14:44,982 --> 00:14:46,382
just let the scar on my face

396
00:14:46,582 --> 00:14:48,182
get infected, develop an abscess,

397
00:14:48,382 --> 00:14:48,919
and become a scar so that

398
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:49,582
I don't get married off forever!

399
00:14:49,742 --> 00:14:50,502
Shut up.

400
00:14:51,702 --> 00:14:53,542
How could you say nonsense like that?

401
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,902
I'd rather die unmarried

402
00:14:56,902 --> 00:14:57,862
than be accused wrongly.

403
00:14:59,502 --> 00:15:00,662
What is this mud incident?

404
00:15:04,422 --> 00:15:07,102
A few days ago during the polo event,

405
00:15:08,462 --> 00:15:09,937
I offended Fourth Sister.

406
00:15:10,422 --> 00:15:12,542
I accidentally dirtied her dress

407
00:15:13,382 --> 00:15:15,062
with mud.

408
00:15:17,062 --> 00:15:19,182
Just because of an accident,

409
00:15:19,662 --> 00:15:20,542
you bore a grudge

410
00:15:20,582 --> 00:15:21,582
against your little sister?

411
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,902
She deliberately wanted me to

412
00:15:22,942 --> 00:15:24,222
to get humiliated in public!

413
00:15:24,302 --> 00:15:24,782
Molan!

414
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,582
Minglan, you did it deliberately?

415
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:37,342
Yes,

416
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:39,262
but I don't regret it.

417
00:15:42,382 --> 00:15:43,624
If it's a gathering

418
00:15:43,624 --> 00:15:44,927
of both men and women,

419
00:15:45,462 --> 00:15:46,542
there's nothing to fear.

420
00:15:47,302 --> 00:15:48,622
But that time,

421
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:49,862
they clearly said that it was an all-male gathering.

422
00:15:50,342 --> 00:15:51,862
If Fourth Sister went in there...

423
00:15:53,342 --> 00:15:54,892
Momo Kong taught us that

424
00:15:54,892 --> 00:15:56,982
the siblings of one house

425
00:15:57,542 --> 00:15:58,582
are connected as one.

426
00:15:58,742 --> 00:15:59,742
They are to share glory and disaster together.

427
00:16:00,222 --> 00:16:01,374
If one loses face,

428
00:16:01,582 --> 00:16:02,339
our whole family

429
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:03,382
will lose face.

430
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,208
I can't watch Fourth Sister

431
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,022
representing the House of Sheng...

432
00:16:08,222 --> 00:16:09,662
What rubbish are you saying?

433
00:16:09,782 --> 00:16:10,902
You still want to slander me!

434
00:16:11,062 --> 00:16:11,742
Keep her down!

435
00:16:11,913 --> 00:16:12,622
What are you doing!

436
00:16:14,022 --> 00:16:14,902
Open her hands!

437
00:16:18,862 --> 00:16:19,582
Cuiwei!

438
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:25,982
Isn't that a piece

439
00:16:25,982 --> 00:16:27,382
from that shattered ceramic?

440
00:16:28,782 --> 00:16:29,902
This is hard evidence.

441
00:16:33,382 --> 00:16:35,862
I'm done asking what I want to ask.

442
00:16:36,822 --> 00:16:37,462
One was raised

443
00:16:37,462 --> 00:16:39,582
by her own birth mother.

444
00:16:40,502 --> 00:16:41,102
One was raised by me.

445
00:16:41,142 --> 00:16:42,862
One was raised by me.

446
00:16:43,942 --> 00:16:46,182
If I talk, I fear that there might be bias.

447
00:16:47,542 --> 00:16:48,342
You decide.

448
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:50,862
Let's go.

449
00:16:52,942 --> 00:16:53,582
Mother.

450
00:16:58,582 --> 00:16:59,301
Mother,

451
00:17:00,022 --> 00:17:01,222
I wasn't strict with disciplining my family.

452
00:17:01,222 --> 00:17:02,662
I caused you to tire yourself.

453
00:17:23,262 --> 00:17:24,102
Ming'er, get up.

454
00:17:25,182 --> 00:17:25,902
Yes, Father.

455
00:17:29,622 --> 00:17:30,302
Sit down.

456
00:17:41,142 --> 00:17:43,342
You..breached proper etiquette during the polo meet first.

457
00:17:44,142 --> 00:17:45,112
Not only were you not grateful

458
00:17:45,112 --> 00:17:45,862
for your little sister

459
00:17:45,862 --> 00:17:47,222
in preserving your reputation

460
00:17:47,222 --> 00:17:48,902
you even bore hatred against her?

461
00:17:49,942 --> 00:17:51,382
That is your first mistake.

462
00:17:52,742 --> 00:17:53,502
Master.

463
00:17:54,982 --> 00:17:55,582
Mo'er is a

464
00:17:55,582 --> 00:17:57,422
spoiled child.

465
00:17:58,062 --> 00:17:59,087
Let me bear

466
00:17:59,087 --> 00:18:00,782
all her punishment.

467
00:18:01,742 --> 00:18:02,702
Father,

468
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,662
I admit

469
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:06,462
my mistake.

470
00:18:06,542 --> 00:18:08,262
Mo'er really knows that she has done wrong.

471
00:18:08,982 --> 00:18:10,462
She now knows that she has done wrong?

472
00:18:11,862 --> 00:18:13,542
It's usual for rich family daughters

473
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:14,542
to argue and fight,

474
00:18:14,742 --> 00:18:15,542
but you shouldn't have got physical to the point

475
00:18:15,542 --> 00:18:17,302
of destroying your little sister's face.

476
00:18:17,942 --> 00:18:18,822
If this gets out,

477
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:19,902
won't people be

478
00:18:19,902 --> 00:18:21,022
laughing at my daughters?

479
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:22,722
If you end up with

480
00:18:22,722 --> 00:18:24,822
a harsh and ferocious reputation,

481
00:18:25,182 --> 00:18:26,342
what good future can you still have?

482
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:30,382
You are to be hit twenty times on your palm,

483
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:31,542
locked inside the ancestral hall

484
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:32,422
to kneel and repent on your sins!

485
00:18:33,142 --> 00:18:34,462
Without my orders, you are not to come out!

486
00:18:34,862 --> 00:18:35,782
Father...

487
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,742
Father...

488
00:18:38,582 --> 00:18:39,382
Mother...

489
00:18:49,182 --> 00:18:50,742
Miss, endure it a little.

490
00:18:53,902 --> 00:18:54,782
It hurts!

491
00:18:54,902 --> 00:18:55,450
It hurts...

492
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:55,862
I'll do it lightly.

493
00:18:55,883 --> 00:18:57,414
You now know that it hurts?

494
00:18:58,702 --> 00:18:59,942
If you leave a scar on your face,

495
00:19:00,702 --> 00:19:02,067
don't even think of going to

496
00:19:02,067 --> 00:19:03,622
the House of Count Yongchang.

497
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,742
I don't really plan to enter

498
00:19:14,742 --> 00:19:15,902
the House of Count Yongchang.

499
00:19:19,022 --> 00:19:20,982
I just can't understand one thing.

500
00:19:20,982 --> 00:19:22,014
Big Madam Wu can have

501
00:19:22,014 --> 00:19:23,422
any kind of daughter-in-law that she wants.

502
00:19:24,582 --> 00:19:25,262
Why must she insist on

503
00:19:25,262 --> 00:19:26,422
having an concubine-born daughter like me?

504
00:19:26,942 --> 00:19:28,182
What is she after?

505
00:19:31,662 --> 00:19:34,262
Did you ask her?

506
00:19:35,182 --> 00:19:36,382
She will never tell me even if I do.

507
00:19:37,182 --> 00:19:39,302
It's lucky that Xiaotao

508
00:19:39,342 --> 00:19:40,342
is quite dumb.

509
00:19:40,662 --> 00:19:41,898
No matter what she says,

510
00:19:42,062 --> 00:19:43,182
no one guards against it.

511
00:19:44,302 --> 00:19:45,462
These past days,

512
00:19:45,702 --> 00:19:47,382
there were successive peach flower banquets,

513
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,835
jiju matches,

514
00:19:48,838 --> 00:19:49,782
scholar assemblies,

515
00:19:51,182 --> 00:19:52,182
and some touhu and marble games.

516
00:19:52,902 --> 00:19:54,582
Anyway, Xiaotao got close to the maidservant

517
00:19:54,582 --> 00:19:56,822
of the fifth wife of Minister Li.

518
00:19:57,622 --> 00:19:58,862
Fifth Madam then

519
00:19:58,862 --> 00:20:00,222
knows Madam Fang,

520
00:20:00,222 --> 00:20:00,694
the granddaughter of the uncle

521
00:20:00,694 --> 00:20:01,102
of Duke Ying of the State.

522
00:20:02,422 --> 00:20:03,902
After making so many acquaintances,

523
00:20:04,182 --> 00:20:04,982
I finally learned

524
00:20:05,222 --> 00:20:07,422
that Sixth Young Master Liang

525
00:20:07,862 --> 00:20:09,262
got himself into trouble,

526
00:20:09,782 --> 00:20:11,102
and can't clean it up.

527
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,622
The Countess felt that I'm good at jiju

528
00:20:16,062 --> 00:20:17,062
and am a lot like her,

529
00:20:18,142 --> 00:20:18,979
so I surely would be able to

530
00:20:18,979 --> 00:20:19,862
handle the harem of her son.

531
00:20:20,622 --> 00:20:22,062
That's why she lowered herself and favored me.

532
00:20:25,422 --> 00:20:26,862
You are quite clever.

533
00:20:27,262 --> 00:20:28,702
You were able to

534
00:20:28,702 --> 00:20:31,013
find out the situation of their house.

535
00:20:33,302 --> 00:20:33,982
Here.

536
00:20:35,862 --> 00:20:37,879
Did you find out

537
00:20:37,879 --> 00:20:39,622
the identity of that woman?

538
00:20:42,142 --> 00:20:42,862
Yes.

539
00:20:45,102 --> 00:20:48,822
She's the concubine-born daughter

540
00:20:48,822 --> 00:20:49,902
of the concubine-born little sister...

541
00:20:52,262 --> 00:20:53,382
of the cousin...

542
00:20:55,862 --> 00:20:57,902
of the wife of Eldest Young Master Liang!

543
00:21:04,302 --> 00:21:04,982
Go to your bed.

544
00:21:08,662 --> 00:21:09,942
Rest early.

545
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:13,742
We can't really blame the Countess.

546
00:21:14,702 --> 00:21:15,325
The concubine-born eldest son

547
00:21:15,325 --> 00:21:16,182
was able to pass the Imperial exams

548
00:21:16,182 --> 00:21:17,342
and become an official first,

549
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,789
while her legitimate-born Sixth Young Master

550
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:21,462
has done such an uncultured act.

551
00:21:22,502 --> 00:21:23,742
That woman even threatened

552
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:25,502
that if she was not allowed to enter their house,

553
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,582
she would kill herself

554
00:21:26,582 --> 00:21:27,822
on their doorstep!

555
00:21:28,742 --> 00:21:29,502
Big Madam Wu

556
00:21:29,502 --> 00:21:30,382
has no choice.

557
00:21:31,182 --> 00:21:33,342
She can only look for a good wife for her son

558
00:21:33,622 --> 00:21:34,382
to clean up

559
00:21:34,382 --> 00:21:35,702
this mess that he made.

560
00:21:37,182 --> 00:21:38,782
Since you already know everything,

561
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:40,822
and you don't want to go to the House of Liang,

562
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,822
why then must you

563
00:21:42,822 --> 00:21:43,902
instigate Molan

564
00:21:44,582 --> 00:21:45,662
to fight with you?

565
00:21:47,702 --> 00:21:48,458
I indeed have no intention of

566
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:49,342
getting into the House of Liang,

567
00:21:49,502 --> 00:21:50,144
but Fourth Sister keeps

568
00:21:50,144 --> 00:21:51,022
making things difficult for me.

569
00:21:52,782 --> 00:21:53,782
Since...

570
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:54,902
Since it's like that

571
00:21:54,902 --> 00:21:55,915
it's better to take advantage of

572
00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:56,702
this undeserved reputation.

573
00:21:58,942 --> 00:21:59,942
I know.

574
00:22:00,662 --> 00:22:01,822
These past years,

575
00:22:02,502 --> 00:22:05,342
you've endured a lot in this house.

576
00:22:05,502 --> 00:22:06,382
It wasn't easy.

577
00:22:07,142 --> 00:22:10,302
Now, all your hard work is about to bear fruit.

578
00:22:10,542 --> 00:22:12,726
Don't create any more trouble

579
00:22:12,742 --> 00:22:14,662
and stay angry at those vile people.

580
00:22:19,342 --> 00:22:20,462
Still those same reminders.

581
00:22:21,742 --> 00:22:23,782
What's more important is that you figure it out.

582
00:22:25,622 --> 00:22:26,822
I won't force you.

583
00:22:28,022 --> 00:22:29,542
I also am not willing to see you

584
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:31,022
destroy your own future.

585
00:22:32,302 --> 00:22:33,222
I got it, Grandmother.

586
00:22:33,742 --> 00:22:37,102
This medicine was made by the House of He.

587
00:22:38,262 --> 00:22:39,342
Don't worry.

588
00:22:40,622 --> 00:22:43,862
No scar will be left on your face.

589
00:22:55,182 --> 00:22:56,182
Has Minglan gone to sleep?

590
00:22:56,822 --> 00:22:57,862
Yes.

591
00:22:58,062 --> 00:22:59,182
She even complained of pain before sleeping.

592
00:22:59,902 --> 00:23:01,742
Apply the medicine on her every day.

593
00:23:02,062 --> 00:23:02,782
Yes.

594
00:23:05,102 --> 00:23:06,102
Let me ask you,

595
00:23:07,462 --> 00:23:09,342
is there any backstory

596
00:23:09,342 --> 00:23:10,822
on why Ming is suddenly

597
00:23:11,582 --> 00:23:13,222
targeting Molan?

598
00:23:15,302 --> 00:23:16,302
Sixth Miss only said

599
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:17,782
that she can't take how Fourth Miss

600
00:23:17,782 --> 00:23:19,182
has been provoking her out of nowhere.

601
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,342
She did this act today

602
00:23:21,342 --> 00:23:22,782
to kill off her overbearing manner,

603
00:23:22,982 --> 00:23:24,382
so she can live more peacefully from now on.

604
00:23:25,022 --> 00:23:25,662
Really?

605
00:23:26,942 --> 00:23:28,502
If it's just sibling rivalry,

606
00:23:28,502 --> 00:23:30,422
why must she escalate it to this level?

607
00:23:31,262 --> 00:23:32,062
It's true.

608
00:23:33,582 --> 00:23:35,153
But Sixth Miss also said earlier

609
00:23:35,153 --> 00:23:36,702
that she didn't expect Fourth Miss

610
00:23:36,702 --> 00:23:37,800
to be so malicious and ruthless.

611
00:23:37,822 --> 00:23:38,742
She got very frightened afterwards.

612
00:23:39,862 --> 00:23:40,822
From now on,

613
00:23:40,822 --> 00:23:42,222
you must take good care of Sixth Miss.

614
00:23:43,182 --> 00:23:44,742
Once she finds a good marriage,

615
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:46,502
you'll also benefit.

616
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,542
Old Madam and Sixth Miss

617
00:23:48,542 --> 00:23:50,412
treat me like family.

618
00:23:50,942 --> 00:23:52,382
As long as it's for the good of Sixth Miss,

619
00:23:52,822 --> 00:23:53,982
it's just right

620
00:23:53,982 --> 00:23:55,142
for me to do my best.

621
00:23:55,582 --> 00:23:56,942
I am not thinking of any benefit.

622
00:23:57,862 --> 00:23:58,622
Go now.

623
00:23:59,382 --> 00:24:00,062
Yes.

624
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,262
I think your wound

625
00:24:14,262 --> 00:24:15,702
has almost healed.

626
00:24:16,022 --> 00:24:17,742
The medicine of Old Madam is really good.

627
00:24:22,102 --> 00:24:22,982
Miss.

628
00:24:24,542 --> 00:24:25,339
Miss.

629
00:24:25,542 --> 00:24:27,142
Young Master He sent some medicine.

630
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,862
He said that your wound will completely heal

631
00:24:28,862 --> 00:24:30,102
after applying it for another week.

632
00:24:30,582 --> 00:24:32,422
I just praised the medicine of Old Madam earlier.

633
00:24:32,622 --> 00:24:33,462
Could it be that

634
00:24:33,462 --> 00:24:34,502
the He Family has a better medicine?

635
00:24:35,782 --> 00:24:37,582
Did you give a tip?

636
00:24:38,702 --> 00:24:40,302
It's not a servant that delivered it.

637
00:24:40,582 --> 00:24:42,262
It was Young Master He who personally brought it.

638
00:24:54,102 --> 00:24:55,222
Did you give her the medicine?

639
00:24:56,022 --> 00:24:57,142
I did.

640
00:24:57,462 --> 00:24:58,902
Young Master He, thank you for your efforts.

641
00:24:59,542 --> 00:25:00,662
The wound of our Miss

642
00:25:00,662 --> 00:25:01,822
has gotten better.

643
00:25:02,422 --> 00:25:03,860
Adding your medicinal cream,

644
00:25:03,862 --> 00:25:05,382
it surely will heal sooner.

645
00:25:07,142 --> 00:25:08,294
Miss said that she wants to

646
00:25:08,294 --> 00:25:10,302
treat you to some tea as her thanks.

647
00:25:10,702 --> 00:25:11,782
No. No.

648
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,544
When a woman's face is wounded,

649
00:25:13,544 --> 00:25:14,902
no matter how small the wound is,

650
00:25:15,102 --> 00:25:16,302
it is quite embarrassing to see anyone.

651
00:25:17,542 --> 00:25:18,262
Sixth Miss has suffered

652
00:25:18,262 --> 00:25:19,382
such a huge grievance.

653
00:25:19,942 --> 00:25:21,336
I fear that she might feel so anxious about it.

654
00:25:22,102 --> 00:25:23,662
Please relay my message

655
00:25:23,942 --> 00:25:24,658
that as long as she uses

656
00:25:24,658 --> 00:25:25,582
the medicinal cream I've brought,

657
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:26,862
it won't leave any scar.

658
00:25:27,142 --> 00:25:28,902
That was an effective medicine

659
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:29,391
that my grandmother created

660
00:25:29,391 --> 00:25:29,982
after several years of research.

661
00:25:30,342 --> 00:25:31,358
I guarantee that superficial wounds

662
00:25:31,358 --> 00:25:32,302
would heal in three to five days.

663
00:25:33,022 --> 00:25:34,662
I surely will relay it to my Miss.

664
00:25:35,542 --> 00:25:37,062
Please don't find me such a nag.

665
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:38,422
I initially brought

666
00:25:38,422 --> 00:25:39,582
some herring from Youyang,

667
00:25:39,942 --> 00:25:41,222
made it into a soup, and delivered it here.

668
00:25:41,822 --> 00:25:43,382
Only then did I learn that Sixth Miss got wounded.

669
00:25:44,262 --> 00:25:45,302
When one has wounds,

670
00:25:45,302 --> 00:25:46,782
she can't eat stimulating food like that.

671
00:25:47,182 --> 00:25:47,942
I could only deliver

672
00:25:47,982 --> 00:25:49,142
it to Old Madam instead.

673
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:51,102
Once her wound has healed,

674
00:25:51,102 --> 00:25:52,702
I'll ask someone to bring me a few more.

675
00:25:52,982 --> 00:25:54,062
I'll make her another soup.

676
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,773
You must relay this message to her.

677
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:00,142
Young Master, don't worry.

678
00:26:00,622 --> 00:26:02,062
Sixth Miss will understand.

679
00:26:02,542 --> 00:26:03,542
That's good.

680
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:04,462
That's good.

681
00:26:06,622 --> 00:26:07,502
I'll get going now.

682
00:26:07,862 --> 00:26:08,174
Oh, right,

683
00:26:08,174 --> 00:26:08,782
these items are

684
00:26:08,782 --> 00:26:10,422
all for your Miss.

685
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:11,542
They are a bit heavy.

686
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:13,062
Just call a servant later

687
00:26:13,062 --> 00:26:13,902
to help you carry them.

688
00:26:15,462 --> 00:26:16,582
Young Master He, take care then.

689
00:26:16,822 --> 00:26:18,542
Qiuguo, escort Young Master out.

690
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:19,422
Yes.

691
00:26:22,262 --> 00:26:23,462
Thank you.

692
00:26:23,822 --> 00:26:24,582
Young Master He.

693
00:26:32,222 --> 00:26:33,022
Xiaotao.

694
00:26:36,182 --> 00:26:37,022
Miss, look.

695
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:38,822
Young Master He is really a good man.

696
00:26:38,942 --> 00:26:39,982
He brought us so much food!

697
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:42,822
Let's take them in to taste them.

698
00:26:43,982 --> 00:26:45,022
Xiaotao, let's go.

699
00:27:26,302 --> 00:27:27,502
How is it going?

700
00:27:29,622 --> 00:27:31,742
Did Little Mother go begging to Father for leniency?

701
00:27:34,062 --> 00:27:35,982
I've been kneeling here for three days.

702
00:27:37,262 --> 00:27:39,542
My knees are already swollen like steamed cakes,

703
00:27:41,622 --> 00:27:42,754
but Father

704
00:27:42,754 --> 00:27:43,982
never even visited me.

705
00:27:46,742 --> 00:27:48,022
Mistress did beg him.

706
00:27:48,862 --> 00:27:49,862
But Master kept saying that

707
00:27:49,862 --> 00:27:50,982
he's busy with official matters

708
00:27:50,982 --> 00:27:52,142
and hasn't been coming home all night.

709
00:27:52,502 --> 00:27:53,502
He hasn't come home

710
00:27:53,502 --> 00:27:54,462
for two days.

711
00:27:55,142 --> 00:27:56,662
Even if Mistress wants to, she can't do anything.

712
00:27:57,702 --> 00:27:58,942
She's unable to meet him.

713
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:06,102
Father is indeed completely mad at me.

714
00:28:09,262 --> 00:28:11,142
He doesn't love me anymore.

715
00:28:11,382 --> 00:28:12,542
Miss, don't cry.

716
00:28:13,262 --> 00:28:14,902
Mistress asked me to relay a message to you.

717
00:28:15,822 --> 00:28:17,502
Master will eventually come home.

718
00:28:17,582 --> 00:28:19,262
She will go beg him then.

719
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,942
You know

720
00:28:20,942 --> 00:28:22,382
her ability.

721
00:28:22,582 --> 00:28:24,262
I'm sure Master will be softhearted.

722
00:28:24,942 --> 00:28:26,302
It's just that Miss,

723
00:28:26,302 --> 00:28:27,862
you have to act while you're here.

724
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:30,982
No need for you to teach me that.

725
00:28:33,142 --> 00:28:36,342
Go out and tell my Little Mother

726
00:28:38,502 --> 00:28:40,062
to quickly save me.

727
00:28:43,102 --> 00:28:44,382
Eat some first.

728
00:29:03,222 --> 00:29:04,062
Miss...

729
00:29:08,102 --> 00:29:09,502
Miss, stop crying.

730
00:29:14,662 --> 00:29:15,422
Miss.

731
00:29:19,222 --> 00:29:20,102
Oh, no!

732
00:29:21,422 --> 00:29:23,502
Fourth Miss has fainted!

733
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:25,942
Oh no, the Fourth Miss has fainted!

734
00:29:33,302 --> 00:29:34,142
Master.

735
00:29:39,662 --> 00:29:40,462
Master.

736
00:29:42,502 --> 00:29:44,142
Why are you here?

737
00:29:45,502 --> 00:29:46,376
Mo'er has been kneeling inside

738
00:29:46,376 --> 00:29:47,370
the ancestral hall for three days.

739
00:29:47,822 --> 00:29:49,342
She wasn't eating or drinking,

740
00:29:49,342 --> 00:29:50,622
and fainted just now.

741
00:29:51,342 --> 00:29:52,782
Go and look for a doctor then.

742
00:29:53,102 --> 00:29:54,742
What's the use of you being here crying?

743
00:29:56,702 --> 00:29:58,702
Mo'er already knows her mistake.

744
00:29:58,942 --> 00:30:00,822
She has such a weak and delicate body.

745
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,142
She really can't bear

746
00:30:02,142 --> 00:30:03,582
such a harsh punishment.

747
00:30:03,782 --> 00:30:05,582
Darling Hong, just forgive her.

748
00:30:06,022 --> 00:30:06,862
Unable to bear it?

749
00:30:08,757 --> 00:30:09,832
Minglan then is able to

750
00:30:09,832 --> 00:30:10,782
bear her slaps?

751
00:30:10,782 --> 00:30:12,182
Able to bear that broken ceramic shard?

752
00:30:14,902 --> 00:30:16,022
Mo'er indeed got physical,

753
00:30:16,742 --> 00:30:17,422
but it was also because...

754
00:30:19,422 --> 00:30:21,302
she has grievances she can't talk about.

755
00:30:21,742 --> 00:30:22,502
That Big Madam Wu invited

756
00:30:22,502 --> 00:30:24,062
our daughters for a scholarly assembly,

757
00:30:24,462 --> 00:30:25,431
but our Big Madam insisted on

758
00:30:25,431 --> 00:30:26,259
not taking Molan with her.

759
00:30:28,382 --> 00:30:29,502
She got anxious.

760
00:30:29,942 --> 00:30:31,302
It wasn't that she was able to attend...

761
00:30:32,342 --> 00:30:34,262
The men and women were clearly gathered together.

762
00:30:35,182 --> 00:30:36,542
But Sixth Miss instead said...

763
00:30:37,782 --> 00:30:38,662
that she tried to show herself

764
00:30:38,662 --> 00:30:39,902
in a gathering only for men.

765
00:30:40,182 --> 00:30:41,862
She suffered such huge slander

766
00:30:41,862 --> 00:30:42,942
and is unable to defend herself.

767
00:30:45,462 --> 00:30:46,222
Darling Hong,

768
00:30:46,582 --> 00:30:48,262
it was really just a moment of anger

769
00:30:49,102 --> 00:30:49,982
that's why Mo'er...

770
00:30:51,062 --> 00:30:53,462
She could have just told me her grievances.

771
00:30:53,942 --> 00:30:55,782
How could she scandalously hit her little sister?

772
00:30:57,502 --> 00:30:58,822
Moreover, Minglan has always acted

773
00:30:58,822 --> 00:31:01,302
in a well-educated and proper manner.

774
00:31:01,742 --> 00:31:03,182
She's not a wild child.

775
00:31:03,422 --> 00:31:04,422
I know that every well.

776
00:31:07,182 --> 00:31:08,462
It must be Mo'er who misunderstood her.

777
00:31:10,062 --> 00:31:11,222
Yes. Yes.

778
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,302
Sixth Miss has always acted

779
00:31:14,302 --> 00:31:15,422
in a well-educated and proper manner.

780
00:31:16,662 --> 00:31:18,022
Both are sisters.

781
00:31:18,542 --> 00:31:19,622
She also couldn't severely criticize

782
00:31:19,622 --> 00:31:20,782
her blood-related sister.

783
00:31:22,222 --> 00:31:23,702
If you don't care for her,

784
00:31:24,622 --> 00:31:26,422
I'm willing to kneel on her behalf.

785
00:31:26,582 --> 00:31:28,982
I'll go to the ancestral hall now and kneel for her.

786
00:31:41,782 --> 00:31:42,662
Shuang!

787
00:31:44,782 --> 00:31:45,422
Shuang!

788
00:31:49,142 --> 00:31:49,822
Get up.

789
00:31:50,862 --> 00:31:51,542
Darling Hong...

790
00:31:58,102 --> 00:31:58,822
How do you feel?

791
00:31:59,862 --> 00:32:00,582
I feel dizzy.

792
00:32:06,142 --> 00:32:08,022
This matter has already been pacified.

793
00:32:08,582 --> 00:32:10,102
Why must you insist on creating more trouble?

794
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,302
Your health is weaker than Mo'er's.

795
00:32:13,982 --> 00:32:15,622
How could you bear her punishment on her behalf?

796
00:32:17,462 --> 00:32:18,302
Darling Hong..

797
00:32:21,142 --> 00:32:22,822
I really have brought trouble

798
00:32:22,822 --> 00:32:24,662
to Mo'er because of my obsession.

799
00:32:25,662 --> 00:32:26,782
You must take care of

800
00:32:26,782 --> 00:32:28,382
Mo'er's marriage plan.

801
00:32:31,782 --> 00:32:33,662
How could I not know your hardship?

802
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:36,382
How about this?

803
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:38,942
Mo'er doesn't need to kneel anymore.

804
00:32:39,942 --> 00:32:41,142
She can go back to Linqi Pavilion and recuperate,

805
00:32:43,302 --> 00:32:44,822
but be grounded for three months.

806
00:32:45,622 --> 00:32:47,062
Only this way can it be

807
00:32:47,062 --> 00:32:48,062
acceptable to Old Madam.

808
00:32:49,102 --> 00:32:50,142
Three months?

809
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:52,742
Then won't she suffocate from boredom?

810
00:32:53,622 --> 00:32:54,622
Not letting her go out

811
00:32:54,622 --> 00:32:56,062
is because I'm afraid that this scandalous matter

812
00:32:56,062 --> 00:32:57,542
of her hitting her little sister

813
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:58,462
will get out and ruin her reputation.

814
00:32:59,462 --> 00:33:01,262
I'm already being biased toward her!

815
00:33:01,422 --> 00:33:03,222
If Big Madam finds out about this,

816
00:33:03,742 --> 00:33:05,262
she surely will fight me on this again.

817
00:33:07,102 --> 00:33:09,173
But right now is exactly the season of good weather

818
00:33:09,173 --> 00:33:10,422
when aristocratic

819
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:11,702
and rich families come out to look around.

820
00:33:11,862 --> 00:33:13,022
No need to look around.

821
00:33:13,422 --> 00:33:15,622
I surely will find her a pleasant husband.

822
00:33:22,222 --> 00:33:23,022
Darling Hong,

823
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:26,302
I know that you have suffered a lot

824
00:33:26,302 --> 00:33:27,662
for me and my children.

825
00:33:29,062 --> 00:33:30,502
I remember all of them.

826
00:33:32,022 --> 00:33:33,342
If Big Madam has any complaints,

827
00:33:33,502 --> 00:33:34,902
I'll go kowtow to her

828
00:33:34,902 --> 00:33:36,462
until she's satisfied.

829
00:33:36,622 --> 00:33:37,382
Forget it.

830
00:33:37,742 --> 00:33:38,192
If you go,

831
00:33:38,199 --> 00:33:39,182
she'll just get angrier.

832
00:33:40,742 --> 00:33:42,222
If this scandalous matter gets out,

833
00:33:42,422 --> 00:33:43,502
it won't be good.

834
00:33:45,422 --> 00:33:47,022
I just wish that our house

835
00:33:47,342 --> 00:33:48,982
could be quiet and peaceful.

836
00:33:49,062 --> 00:33:50,262
That's better than anything else.

837
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:52,822
Once this matter has passed,

838
00:33:53,662 --> 00:33:55,222
I'll boldly go out and show my face

839
00:33:55,982 --> 00:33:57,462
to find Mo'er a good husband.

840
00:33:58,142 --> 00:33:59,142
Is that okay?

841
00:34:03,982 --> 00:34:05,302
This is a place for studying.

842
00:34:05,542 --> 00:34:06,342
So improper.

843
00:34:07,222 --> 00:34:08,102
Go.

844
00:34:18,422 --> 00:34:19,782
After thinking about it all night,

845
00:34:21,062 --> 00:34:21,904
on the list of men waiting

846
00:34:21,904 --> 00:34:22,862
to take the Imperial exams,

847
00:34:23,582 --> 00:34:25,022
there is a scholar

848
00:34:25,782 --> 00:34:26,622
named Wen Yanjing.

849
00:34:27,622 --> 00:34:28,722
He has good looks

850
00:34:28,982 --> 00:34:30,062
and his prose was well-written.

851
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:31,102
Aren't you and Mo'er

852
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:32,342
worrying about her marriage?

853
00:34:33,142 --> 00:34:35,222
I think that this person is a good match.

854
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,182
A scholar that you choose

855
00:34:37,182 --> 00:34:38,382
will surely be handsome and talented.

856
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,062
May I ask

857
00:34:40,062 --> 00:34:41,462
which rich family is he from?

858
00:34:48,142 --> 00:34:49,222
Tell me!

859
00:34:50,062 --> 00:34:51,302
It's not really some illustrious house,

860
00:34:51,862 --> 00:34:53,102
but one with a good reputation.

861
00:34:53,582 --> 00:34:54,195
Although their family has engaged

862
00:34:54,195 --> 00:34:54,782
in agriculture for generations,

863
00:34:55,542 --> 00:34:56,902
all their descendants are educated.

864
00:34:57,782 --> 00:34:58,502
In his generation,

865
00:34:58,542 --> 00:35:00,142
at a young age, he's already a juren.

866
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:00,782
Agricultural work?

867
00:35:02,982 --> 00:35:03,822
Agricultural work.

868
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:06,822
How many farmlands and houses

869
00:35:06,822 --> 00:35:07,522
does their family own?

870
00:35:07,702 --> 00:35:08,662
Do they have any shops?

871
00:35:09,382 --> 00:35:10,542
Just a few mu of farmland.

872
00:35:11,462 --> 00:35:13,542
It's being managed by his old mother and brothers.

873
00:35:14,382 --> 00:35:15,622
Although they are not wealthy,

874
00:35:16,422 --> 00:35:17,662
there won't be a problem in having food to eat.

875
00:35:18,422 --> 00:35:19,342
Absolutely impossible!

876
00:35:20,622 --> 00:35:21,422
Darling Hong...

877
00:35:21,862 --> 00:35:23,302
I know what you mean.

878
00:35:23,782 --> 00:35:24,222
This isn't

879
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:25,622
a disadvantage either.

880
00:35:26,222 --> 00:35:28,582
I can see that lad has talent.

881
00:35:29,542 --> 00:35:30,382
Ranking in the main Imperial exams

882
00:35:30,382 --> 00:35:31,582
will happen sooner or later.

883
00:35:32,302 --> 00:35:33,902
He surely will have a good

884
00:35:33,902 --> 00:35:34,742
official position in the future.

885
00:35:34,942 --> 00:35:35,702
Our Mo'er—

886
00:35:35,742 --> 00:35:36,502
Absolutely not!

887
00:35:38,822 --> 00:35:39,662
Mo'er, she...is

888
00:35:40,542 --> 00:35:42,102
so delicate and precious.

889
00:35:42,462 --> 00:35:43,262
How could she marry into

890
00:35:43,262 --> 00:35:44,782
a poor family like that?

891
00:35:46,862 --> 00:35:48,782
Is marrying into a family higher than us

892
00:35:48,782 --> 00:35:49,662
the only definition of marrying?

893
00:35:51,262 --> 00:35:52,582
Rulan is even the legitimate daughter here.

894
00:35:53,022 --> 00:35:54,022
Big Madam has never thought of her getting married

895
00:35:54,022 --> 00:35:54,982
into a higher-ranking family than ours.

896
00:35:55,542 --> 00:35:57,222
Minglan was raised by Old Madam.

897
00:35:58,022 --> 00:35:59,662
Her ancestral line was listed under Big Madam's house.

898
00:35:59,902 --> 00:36:01,182
But in terms of marriage,

899
00:36:01,302 --> 00:36:02,942
Old Madam also looks on the person's character

900
00:36:02,942 --> 00:36:03,902
and not on the status of his family.

901
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:05,662
They all just said

902
00:36:05,662 --> 00:36:06,662
those words to satisfy you.

903
00:36:07,622 --> 00:36:08,742
Which house doesn't want to marry their daughter off

904
00:36:08,742 --> 00:36:09,902
to a richer and more powerful family?

905
00:36:10,182 --> 00:36:11,862
No matter how they deny it, it won't work!

906
00:36:12,102 --> 00:36:13,582
That Old Madam and Big Madam

907
00:36:13,582 --> 00:36:14,942
surely are privately looking...

908
00:36:15,062 --> 00:36:16,089
If you didn't only look at

909
00:36:16,089 --> 00:36:17,302
a person's character and ability,

910
00:36:17,582 --> 00:36:18,742
why then did you

911
00:36:18,742 --> 00:36:20,142
give up

912
00:36:20,142 --> 00:36:21,262
being a main wife

913
00:36:22,022 --> 00:36:23,262
and became my concubine?

914
00:36:24,742 --> 00:36:25,622
Darling Hong,

915
00:36:26,382 --> 00:36:27,241
how can that lad compare

916
00:36:27,241 --> 00:36:28,222
to your good looks and talent?

917
00:36:30,502 --> 00:36:31,822
It's just that since I have a

918
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:32,862
handsome and talented husband like you,

919
00:36:33,542 --> 00:36:35,462
how could I be contented to marry off

920
00:36:35,462 --> 00:36:36,422
our daughter to that kind of man?

921
00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:38,826
What's more important is that our son-in-law

922
00:36:38,826 --> 00:36:39,862
must be willing to improve himself.

923
00:36:40,662 --> 00:36:41,862
If you climb too high, you surely will fall worse.

924
00:36:43,302 --> 00:36:44,662
You will suffer, sooner or later.

925
00:36:47,302 --> 00:36:48,142
Darling Hong...

926
00:36:48,183 --> 00:36:49,580
Okay already. I know.

927
00:36:49,702 --> 00:36:51,782
You are worried about Mo'er's future.

928
00:36:52,262 --> 00:36:53,502
I also dote on her.

929
00:36:53,942 --> 00:36:54,542
I meticulously

930
00:36:54,542 --> 00:36:56,061
chose this lad.

931
00:36:56,102 --> 00:36:57,182
He surely will be blessed.

932
00:36:57,302 --> 00:36:58,142
Don't worry.

933
00:36:58,702 --> 00:36:59,337
After eating breakfast,

934
00:36:59,337 --> 00:37:00,502
I still have to handle some official matters.

935
00:37:17,582 --> 00:37:17,982
Lighter.

936
00:37:19,582 --> 00:37:20,222
Okay already.

937
00:37:24,062 --> 00:37:24,782
What's wrong?

938
00:37:26,902 --> 00:37:28,262
After that Mistress Lin cried

939
00:37:28,262 --> 00:37:29,182
and created a ruckus,

940
00:37:29,222 --> 00:37:30,302
Master gave way.

941
00:37:31,422 --> 00:37:32,382
Just for Mistress Lin,

942
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:33,782
Master wouldn't even care about your life or death.

943
00:37:36,742 --> 00:37:37,782
My silly Xiaotao.

944
00:37:38,262 --> 00:37:39,982
Father didn't do it for Mistress Lin's sake.

945
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:40,862
He just doesn't want

946
00:37:40,862 --> 00:37:42,022
this matter to escalate.

947
00:37:43,862 --> 00:37:44,902
I've blocked off Fourth Miss

948
00:37:44,902 --> 00:37:46,222
from showing off in front of others.

949
00:37:47,102 --> 00:37:47,989
Trouble hasn't started yet

950
00:37:47,989 --> 00:37:48,982
and has already been pacified.

951
00:37:49,182 --> 00:37:51,062
He surely is happy deep inside.

952
00:37:52,262 --> 00:37:53,382
As long as this house

953
00:37:54,262 --> 00:37:55,342
stays quiet and peaceful,

954
00:37:55,382 --> 00:37:56,902
as long as harmony can be maintained,

955
00:37:57,782 --> 00:37:58,702
he won't care about

956
00:37:58,702 --> 00:37:59,702
how many grievances

957
00:37:59,822 --> 00:38:00,742
or how much blood was lost

958
00:38:00,742 --> 00:38:01,502
by the people under him.

959
00:38:02,902 --> 00:38:03,742
Miss,

960
00:38:03,902 --> 00:38:05,422
you've already risked paying the price of

961
00:38:05,422 --> 00:38:06,742
destroying your face and losing a good future,

962
00:38:06,942 --> 00:38:08,182
and ended up with just this kind of result.

963
00:38:09,582 --> 00:38:10,502
Why don't we stop now?

964
00:38:10,902 --> 00:38:12,062
Don't get yourself really hurt.

965
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:14,582
It's okay.

966
00:38:15,622 --> 00:38:17,342
Since this trouble wasn't huge enough,

967
00:38:17,782 --> 00:38:18,902
let's incite something bigger.

968
00:38:19,982 --> 00:38:21,062
Big enough that it can't be covered up.

969
00:38:23,142 --> 00:38:23,982
Sixth Miss!

970
00:38:28,862 --> 00:38:29,822
Old Madam sent me

971
00:38:29,822 --> 00:38:30,822
to tell you

972
00:38:31,182 --> 00:38:32,062
that Young Master He is here

973
00:38:32,062 --> 00:38:33,262
and he gifted a lot of objects.

974
00:38:33,662 --> 00:38:34,822
If it's convenient,

975
00:38:35,022 --> 00:38:35,982
she asked that you go thank him personally.

976
00:38:38,622 --> 00:38:40,022
My face hasn't fully healed.

977
00:38:40,182 --> 00:38:41,902
Please go back and tell them

978
00:38:42,102 --> 00:38:43,276
that I will visit him next time

979
00:38:43,276 --> 00:38:44,142
to personally thank him.

980
00:38:48,542 --> 00:38:49,862
I think Young Master He is better.

981
00:38:50,022 --> 00:38:50,662
Every time he comes,

982
00:38:50,782 --> 00:38:52,062
he gives us so much delicious food.

983
00:38:53,342 --> 00:38:54,462
He's really very considerate.

984
00:38:54,622 --> 00:38:55,622
Don't know if this time

985
00:38:55,622 --> 00:38:56,622
there are rose biscuits..?

986
00:39:00,902 --> 00:39:01,982
You only care about eating!

987
00:39:11,022 --> 00:39:11,702
They're here.

988
00:39:11,902 --> 00:39:12,782
Miss, they're here.

989
00:39:15,022 --> 00:39:15,902
Miss, look.

990
00:39:15,902 --> 00:39:17,142
Isn't it like what I told you?

991
00:39:19,702 --> 00:39:20,582
Lightly.

992
00:39:21,462 --> 00:39:22,502
Be careful.

993
00:39:25,902 --> 00:39:27,342
They all are even wearing new clothes.

994
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:31,662
What is

995
00:39:31,662 --> 00:39:32,542
inside those boxes?

996
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:34,662
Be gentle.

997
00:39:35,502 --> 00:39:36,542
What is inside?

998
00:39:37,422 --> 00:39:38,262
Go and ask.

999
00:39:40,862 --> 00:39:41,822
Go.

1000
00:39:46,822 --> 00:39:47,862
Don't look for higher-ranking maidservants

1001
00:39:47,862 --> 00:39:48,742
like Danju or Cuiwei.

1002
00:39:49,102 --> 00:39:50,582
Ask that stupid one, Xiaotao.

1003
00:39:58,102 --> 00:39:59,102
Sweep it clean.

1004
00:40:05,782 --> 00:40:06,942
Where did you go?

1005
00:40:06,982 --> 00:40:08,062
How come you're just back now?

1006
00:40:08,302 --> 00:40:09,462
Miss, don't be angry.

1007
00:40:09,742 --> 00:40:11,262
I had to wait for Xiaotao to be alone

1008
00:40:11,422 --> 00:40:13,022
before I can invite her for some drinks and chat.

1009
00:40:15,182 --> 00:40:16,022
How did it go?

1010
00:40:17,222 --> 00:40:18,142
What did she say?

1011
00:40:18,422 --> 00:40:19,942
That dumb Xiaotao told everything

1012
00:40:19,942 --> 00:40:21,862
after being fed a little.

1013
00:40:22,222 --> 00:40:23,342
It was Big Madam

1014
00:40:23,542 --> 00:40:25,182
who told them that they should wear something bright

1015
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:26,982
since the Countess has been coming here often

1016
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,422
so as not to embarrass our house.

1017
00:40:32,742 --> 00:40:34,142
Big Madam Wu frequently comes here?

1018
00:40:34,582 --> 00:40:35,822
How come I didn't know that?

1019
00:40:36,822 --> 00:40:39,782
Maybe Big Madam Wu

1020
00:40:39,782 --> 00:40:40,982
didn't want to disturb you.

1021
00:40:41,222 --> 00:40:42,222
Why does she frequently come here?

1022
00:40:43,022 --> 00:40:44,502
Has she really

1023
00:40:44,502 --> 00:40:45,782
set her eyes on Minglan?

1024
00:40:51,422 --> 00:40:52,182
I'm going to check...

1025
00:40:52,942 --> 00:40:53,782
going to check!

1026
00:40:54,222 --> 00:40:55,302
Miss, you mustn't go.

1027
00:40:55,582 --> 00:40:57,022
After you hurt the face of Sixth Miss last time,

1028
00:40:57,182 --> 00:40:58,582
Master might still be mad.

1029
00:40:58,742 --> 00:41:00,502
No matter what you say this time when you go there,

1030
00:41:00,622 --> 00:41:01,982
you surely will just suffer.

1031
00:41:02,622 --> 00:41:03,542
If I don't go,

1032
00:41:03,782 --> 00:41:05,182
am I just going to sit here and wait for death,

1033
00:41:05,342 --> 00:41:05,782
watch as Minglan gets married

1034
00:41:05,782 --> 00:41:06,942
into an aristocratic family?

1035
00:41:08,022 --> 00:41:08,902
Sixth Miss is after all

1036
00:41:08,902 --> 00:41:10,742
the favorite of Old Madam.

1037
00:41:10,982 --> 00:41:12,742
Master can't really disobey Old Madam.

1038
00:41:12,982 --> 00:41:14,342
We better just look for the Mistress

1039
00:41:14,342 --> 00:41:15,222
to come up with a countermeasure.

1040
00:41:24,022 --> 00:41:25,742
He said that he wouldn't disappoint me.

1041
00:41:26,582 --> 00:41:27,822
How come he is now?

1042
00:41:29,622 --> 00:41:30,942
Brother Yuanruo didn't want me.

1043
00:41:32,502 --> 00:41:33,702
Is Sixth Young Master also abandoning me?
