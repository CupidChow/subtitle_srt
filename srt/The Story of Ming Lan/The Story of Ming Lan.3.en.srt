00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Episode 3

3
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,400
A guest is paying respects.

4
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:11,360
Filial sons and grandsons return the courtesy.

5
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:16,879
Lord, this way, please.

6
00:01:21,279 --> 00:01:23,279
A guest is paying respects.

7
00:01:33,559 --> 00:01:35,559
A guest is paying respects.

8
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,720
It's not that who I want to criticize you,

9
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,959
but your in-law

10
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:46,239
is not good at doing things.

11
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,599
He was here to deliver the betrothal gifts.

12
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,879
Why did he bring a child along with him?

13
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,120
That's right.

14
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,199
And then he didn't

15
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:53,239
tell anyone about it.

16
00:01:54,639 --> 00:01:56,080
A perfect good child,

17
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,720
just died here so suddenly.

18
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,959
It's just getting us

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,599
implicated for no reason.

20
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,599
It is all my fault.

21
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:07,959
But Master Ming, there is no need to be worried.

22
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,119
He brought that person here.

23
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,639
The two of us, we didn't know anything.

24
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,520
It's easy for you to say that.

25
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:16,279
It's a son of the legal wife

26
00:02:16,279 --> 00:02:17,720
in the Marquis' household that's dead.

27
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,080
Today, the repose period is complete.

28
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,600
Late Eldest Uncle, your noble spirit is still present.

29
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,880
It's time to rest in the blessed place

30
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,119
and safeguard our family.

31
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:32,399
Raise the funeral banner.

32
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:35,360
Bring the funeral banner! Lead the way!

33
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:39,080
Bring the funeral banner! Lead the way!

34
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,320
Shatter the crockery! Raise the casket!

35
00:02:45,559 --> 00:02:47,119
What rights do you have as the Second and Third Masters

36
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,880
to start the funeral procession

37
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,000
for the First Master of the House?

38
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,399
Has everyone in the First Master's household died?

39
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,800
Who's that? Who!

40
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:04,119
You're a senile wet nurse,

41
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:05,279
what nonsense are you spouting!

42
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,199
Eldest Young Master Bai,

43
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,759
you are the eldest son of the Second Master.

44
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:10,639
You have nothing to do

45
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:11,360
with the household of the First Master Bai.

46
00:03:11,839 --> 00:03:13,440
We have someone of our own to start the procession.

47
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,199
Brother, why are you talking to her?

48
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,679
Where did this crazy woman come from?

49
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:17,600
Drag her out.

50
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,320
Drag her out.

51
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,320
Just do it!

52
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,199
What are you doing?

53
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,279
Stop!

54
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:22,479
Let me go! Let go!

55
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,440
Stop!

56
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,279
Young Master?

57
00:03:26,279 --> 00:03:26,839
Zhonghuai?

58
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:27,399
He didn't die?

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,720
Zhonghuai!

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,639
Bai Ye? What...?

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,399
You're not dead.

62
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,080
It's Gu Tingye!

63
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,520
This is great. This is really great!

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,800
Such merriment in a mourning hall!

65
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,679
What do you intend to do by this?

66
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,440
It's the Young Master Gu.

67
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,960
How could you come so late!

68
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,639
These bastards, they have no respect for the law,

69
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:52,600
they want to steal the inheritance!

70
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,559
My family is conducting funeral proceedings,

71
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,919
yet you come in here crying,

72
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:58,880
screaming and making merry.

73
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,800
What are your intentions?

74
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:02,199
Men, throw them out!

75
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,000
He's our First Household's Young Master.

76
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,559
You dare to kick him out?

77
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:07,399
Kick him out!

78
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,479
Quick.

79
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,759
Kick him out!

80
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,440
What are all of you doing? Bastards!

81
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,039
Young Master Ye! Young Master Ye!

82
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,720
Stop beating him!

83
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:16,799
Stop! Stop!

84
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,679
Stop fighting!

85
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,440
All of you stop!

86
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,440
What are you doing?

87
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:24,399
Stop! Stop!

88
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,880
This is a mourning hall. Look at what it has become.

89
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,480
It's unbelievable that Uncles from the branches

90
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,040
forbid the grandson from paying his respects.

91
00:04:41,799 --> 00:04:43,519
I have my late maternal grandfather's personal letter,

92
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:45,440
clearly naming me as the rightful heir!

93
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,000
Why can I not be here?

94
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,880
Bullshit!

95
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,679
You are of the Gu family,

96
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,640
we are the Bai family.

97
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,119
Who's ever heard someone from a different house

98
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,239
got named as the heir!

99
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,799
Can it be that

100
00:04:56,799 --> 00:04:58,799
you intend to seize the Bai's fortune by force

101
00:04:59,160 --> 00:04:59,920
just based on the fact that

102
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,119
your father and brother are decorated nobles?

103
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,519
Assembled gentlemen,

104
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,200
venerable elders,

105
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:09,679
please have a look at this letter and then decide.

106
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:32,239
I know my time is short.

107
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,079
I only hope you can inherit the family business,

108
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:42,600
so as to not let it be lost by others' hands.

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,519
Hence I write this last letter.

110
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,720
Your Maternal Grandfather Bai. Awaiting your return.

111
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:49,279
It's true.

112
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,000
This is simply nonsense.

113
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,239
That's right.

114
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:54,279
I have never heard of such a letter!

115
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:54,920
Yes.

116
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:57,839
It could be written by anyone.

117
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:59,720
Who couldn't write such a letter?

118
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,480
You think you can take over

119
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:02,440
the largest salt business in Yangzhou

120
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,600
with just a lousy letter like that?

121
00:06:06,119 --> 00:06:08,200
There would be letters and notes left around the house,

122
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,079
so would all the venerable elders please be witnesses?

123
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:12,399
We can find some notes, compare the handwriting,

124
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,679
and check whether it's authentic or not.

125
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,880
With me,

126
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,799
I have some poems the old Master gifted me.

127
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,200
I was going to burn them

128
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,559
before the altar as an offering to the spirits.

129
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,239
Never thought they could be of this kind of use.

130
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,119
Take it.

131
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,359
What letter?

132
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:35,760
I have never heard of this!

133
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:37,160
Before he passed away,

134
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,399
Uncle said I was resolute and capable.

135
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,119
He personally handed the salt business to me.

136
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,440
Everyone in the Bai family saw that.

137
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,399
Isn't that so?

138
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:45,160
Yes, we saw it.

139
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,920
That is right.

140
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:46,559
Uncle!

141
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,959
Look at my maternal grandfather's memorial tablet.

142
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,000
Look at him.

143
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,359
He's looking at you from heaven!

144
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,079
Swear to him

145
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:56,440
that if anything you just said was false,

146
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,279
then the family shrine will be shaken with unrest,

147
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,600
and your deceased mother's spirit will not rest in peace!

148
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,480
County Magistrate,

149
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,880
we invited you to lead the funeral proceedings,

150
00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:06,679
how could you instead shield each other?

151
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,239
If you don't dare to swear,

152
00:07:08,239 --> 00:07:09,160
I dare!

153
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,880
I, Gu Tingye, swear to heaven.

154
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:14,839
It's true that I have been named as the heir.

155
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,200
Should anything be false,

156
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,959
then the family shrine of mine will be shaken with unrest,

157
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,359
and my deceased mother's spirit will not rest in peace.

158
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:22,760
Uncle,

159
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,320
do you dare to swear on your deceased mother?

160
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:28,239
You... you are just a scoundrel.

161
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:31,119
The heaven and earth,

162
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:31,920
passing spirits

163
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,119
and spiritual officials on duty today,

164
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:35,760
they are all watching us!

165
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,119
Uncle, why do you not dare to swear?

166
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,600
I will say it then.

167
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,399
I...

168
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,399
Bai Tingyu

169
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,440
I swear to heaven.

170
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,160
It's true that I have been named as the heir.

171
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,519
Should anything be false,

172
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,279
then the family shrine...

173
00:07:58,239 --> 00:07:59,119
then the... family shrine...

174
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,640
Watch your tongue!

175
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:04,239
He is a well-known delinquent

176
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:05,839
in Bianjing City.

177
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,760
A notable scoundrel

178
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,239
among the wealthy young nobles.

179
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,279
He dares to voice such blasphemy

180
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:12,160
against the family shrine.

181
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,519
Have all your years of education

182
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:15,480
gone to waste

183
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:17,440
that you will compete with him

184
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,600
on how boorish one can be?

185
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,440
Sorry, father, you are correct.

186
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,880
Hypocrites, all of you.

187
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:23,559
Always quoting

188
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:24,440
the Sage's words,

189
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,799
yet you speak nothing

190
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:27,959
but lies and try to fool the people.

191
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,959
Venerable elders and officials,

192
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:33,200
I have worked in this household my whole life.

193
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:34,799
I know best where everything is.

194
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,640
I'll take everyone to find

195
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,280
where my Master's letters and notes are.

196
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,320
Old crone!

197
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,960
This is the Bai's family manor!

198
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,679
You just wield some lies here

199
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:46,960
with a few officials backing you up.

200
00:08:47,719 --> 00:08:49,320
So you want to just search and confiscate all you want?

201
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,640
If you want to get in

202
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,200
this courtyard today,

203
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,960
you can step over my dead body!

204
00:08:54,719 --> 00:08:55,760
Return the slave contracts!

205
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,479
Return them to us!

206
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,520
Return the slave contracts.

207
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:01,039
Our master has passed away,

208
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,440
and you took away our slave contracts.

209
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:04,919
Return them to us.

210
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,320
Return the slave contract to us.

211
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,159
Return them to us.

212
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:08,799
Return the slave contracts to us.

213
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:12,400
Return the slave contracts to us.

214
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:16,760
Stop creating a scene.

215
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,320
Return the slave contracts to us.

216
00:09:17,359 --> 00:09:18,039
Stop creating a scene.

217
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:19,400
Return the slave contracts to us.

218
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,400
All of you

219
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,359
are Yangzhou's leading figures.

220
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:26,760
We went to admire the flowers

221
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,919
at the Zen Temple last time

222
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,400
and enjoyed together fine wines.

223
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,960
How about we all go look together,

224
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,320
treating it as a leisure outing?

225
00:09:36,119 --> 00:09:36,919
My lord.

226
00:09:37,599 --> 00:09:38,320
I'm going.

227
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,239
This way, please.

228
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,679
Please.

229
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:41,559
Let's go. Quickly now!

230
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:49,159
Who died in the river then?

231
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:52,239
My junior manservant, Zhique.

232
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:54,280
I switched into his clothes

233
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,359
to carry on as him.

234
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:56,840
You should have come to me when you escaped.

235
00:09:57,479 --> 00:09:58,440
These days,

236
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,559
I haven't had a good sleep.

237
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:01,640
I didn't know how much more treachery awaited me.

238
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,919
If I showed myself, I would implicate you instead.

239
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,679
Now the truth is out and it's alright now,

240
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:07,119
so be at ease.

241
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,840
It's the same.

242
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,679
Isn't it the same?

243
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,119
All of you elders, what do you think?

244
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,679
Brother Changli, what do you think?

245
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:48,760
The handwriting looks similar

246
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,000
but it's hard to identify for sure.

247
00:10:55,599 --> 00:10:57,799
I think the result is self-evident.

248
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:00,039
Everyone assembled...

249
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,400
It is simply a joke!

250
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,080
This is the livelihood of hundreds

251
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:07,520
in the Bai House.

252
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:10,080
We pray to our ancestors and shrines four seasons.

253
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,359
There are schoolchildren and primary schools

254
00:11:11,359 --> 00:11:12,440
and acres of charity farmlands for our hopeless ones .

255
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,880
Our offspring's future all depend on this.

256
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:16,039
It's not just his

257
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:17,119
Eldest Uncle's own asset!

258
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,840
That's right.

259
00:11:18,599 --> 00:11:19,679
Furthermore,

260
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,280
His Eldest Uncle has been sick in bed for a long time.

261
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:23,280
I believe he was confused,

262
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,359
so let we three houses

263
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:25,640
discuss it thoroughly instead!

264
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,000
You're a bunch of filthy brutes!

265
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,919
You live at his house and covet his assets.

266
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:31,200
This family business

267
00:11:31,599 --> 00:11:32,559
was all built up

268
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,080
all by my master himself!

269
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:36,159
You noticed he was well-off

270
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:37,119
so you came one by one to seek refuge.

271
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,400
When he's gone,

272
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:40,200
you plot to steal his assets

273
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,320
and oppress his child.

274
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,599
Your conscience has been eaten by dogs!

275
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:45,440
What the hell?

276
00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:46,119
What are you saying?

277
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:47,159
How could you say this?

278
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,760
In order to preserve you elders' reputations,

279
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,679
I did not pull out another letter I have.

280
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,919
But it seems I have no choice but to produce it.

281
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,840
Lord Magistrate, please take a look at it.

282
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:17,840
I was born in a large clan,

283
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,479
but lost my father at a young age.

284
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:22,599
My widowed mother devoted herself to raising me.

285
00:12:22,599 --> 00:12:24,000
The uncles of the clan

286
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:27,159
schemed to seize my late father's bequeathed land

287
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:28,400
of 3 acres.

288
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,599
They tried to chase my mother and I out,

289
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,159
and to remove our names from the genealogy.

290
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,479
Regarding this matter today,

291
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:51,880
in my opinion,

292
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,799
the writing on this letter is most certain

293
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:56,880
to be from Eldest Brother Bai.

294
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:01,760
If you

295
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,440
ever need my help,

296
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:05,200
you can come to the north

297
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,599
and find me at Lotus Village.

298
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:10,880
Everyone, I'm taking my leave first.

299
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,880
Elder Fan.

300
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,520
You can't go.

301
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:17,799
Eldest,

302
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:19,960
you should look at your genealogy.

303
00:13:20,719 --> 00:13:21,559
The salt business.

304
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,760
It's your eldest uncle's personal property.

305
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,679
Even if you go and drum up a royal petition,

306
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,039
it still won't work!

307
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:31,679
Alright, I'm leaving first.

308
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:39,080
Maternal Uncle!

309
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,119
Please return to me,

310
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,119
your nephew,

311
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,400
the shop deeds and seals.

312
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,039
The deeds and seals, they're in the ancestral hall,

313
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:48,039
in the Old Master's room.

314
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,799
It's hard to put them together all so quickly.

315
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,640
Let's wait until the funeral and burial are done.

316
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,799
And I'll just give them to you one by one.

317
00:13:55,719 --> 00:13:56,159
Forget it.

318
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,039
Tell someone to go with me.

319
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:10,159
Lord Sheng.

320
00:14:11,359 --> 00:14:12,000
Can I trouble you to dispatch a few men

321
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,960
to help me with this?

322
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:14,280
Sure, sure.

323
00:14:15,359 --> 00:14:15,960
You two.

324
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,760
Crack the crockery and raise the funeral banner!

325
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:24,799
Old Madam went up the mountain

326
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:25,280
to visit a Taoism practicer.

327
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,679
And your father went to Runzhou

328
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:29,320
to bid farewell to Madam's parents' house.

329
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,479
These days, you can relax some.

330
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,359
When Old Madam is back,

331
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,159
you go and serve her then.

332
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,159
Fourth Sister has been hovering around there though.

333
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:40,640
Your father

334
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,400
wants Molan to go there.

335
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,679
But until now,

336
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:46,280
Old Madam still hasn't permitted it.

337
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,400
It seems she doesn't want her to.

338
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,719
Madam cherishes Rulan.

339
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:54,440
Surely she won't let her do it.

340
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,520
Perhaps ultimately

341
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,919
you're the one to get it.

342
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,000
I won't leave you.

343
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,479
Xiaodie is not here.

344
00:16:09,479 --> 00:16:11,479
I feel uneasy.

345
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,640
If you go to Old Madam,

346
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,159
I will be put at ease.

347
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,440
Our room

348
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,599
isn't bad at all anymore.

349
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,679
What are you really worried about still, Mother.

350
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:22,960
These days,

351
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,760
treasured food has been flowing in like water.

352
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,080
Reason has it that

353
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,039
one ought not to accept rewards undeservingly.

354
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,719
And it's an evil sign to have the abnormality.

355
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,799
Ming'er.

356
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,080
Scholar Chulong once said the best parental love

357
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,719
was planning for the future for children .

358
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:38,080
Do you know what this means?

359
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,320
The empress dowager cherishes the young master.

360
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:43,840
Mother, you want to tell me

361
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,919
I shouldn't be so greedy for comforts in the room.

362
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,640
that I'm disregarding the future.

363
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:47,799
No matter what you say,

364
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:48,599
I'm not going!

365
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,359
I've never seen

366
00:16:51,359 --> 00:16:52,640
a monkey more stubborn!

367
00:16:54,239 --> 00:16:55,880
I told you not to stand out,

368
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,880
but you didn't listen to me.

369
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,719
I told you to go and be raised by Old Madam.

370
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:01,880
And you wouldn't listen to me again!

371
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:03,320
Father is determined

372
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,800
to have Fourth Sister be raised by Grandmother.

373
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,839
If I compete with her,

374
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:07,839
I'd just incite Father's annoyance.

375
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,280
Even if I win,

376
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,280
Father will loathe me,

377
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,439
Mistress Lin will begrudge me,

378
00:17:11,479 --> 00:17:12,959
and this will get a laugh out of this.

379
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,359
If I go to Grandmother's courtyard,

380
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:16,959
how can you live here alone?

381
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,040
You are really stubborn!

382
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,439
Mother. Mother.

383
00:17:26,719 --> 00:17:27,560
Mistress!

384
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,760
Mistress, it's big trouble.

385
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,760
Mistress Wei is in labor!

386
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,800
Ten months of pregnancy and labor in one day.

387
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,119
Mistress! Slow down!

388
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,000
Harder!

389
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,319
Mistress!

390
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,920
Push hard. Harder!

391
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:01,520
The water is not enough. I'm going to check the fire.

392
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,079
OK.

393
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,760
How's Mistress Wei?

394
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,000
The baby is too big.

395
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,400
I'm going to check the fire.

396
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,000
We have the kitchen watching the fire.

397
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,520
Why should you go?

398
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,599
The kitchen doesn't know and they can't boil it well.

399
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:14,640
Let me go to take a look.

400
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,760
Really?

401
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:17,439
Little girl!

402
00:18:17,439 --> 00:18:20,160
Do you know about labor more than me?

403
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,359
Xiaotao, escort Nanny there.

404
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:23,560
Nanny, don't lose your way.

405
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,079
I know the way.

406
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:26,280
Nanny, come with me.

407
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,079
Sixth Miss, don't panic.

408
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,160
A woman

409
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,520
needs to go through this.

410
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:32,479
Or else

411
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:33,760
why would the saying tell us it's a leisure to be a man?

412
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:36,079
Quick,

413
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:37,680
take Sixth Miss to look for Fourth Miss,

414
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,680
lest she get shocked.

415
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,800
Yes, Mistress.

416
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:42,239
Sixth Miss.

417
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:43,800
Go with me to see Fourth Miss.

418
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,400
We've got Mistress Lin here.

419
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,959
I'm staying here!

420
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,040
Water.

421
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,400
I want to drink water.

422
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:04,479
There's no more hot water.

423
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:05,439
I'm going to boil some.

424
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:09,400
It's fine even if it's cold.

425
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,640
Just a lick is fine.

426
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,520
You can't!

427
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:14,640
A woman in labor

428
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,880
needs hot water to warm the belly.

429
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,760
Cold water could make

430
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,640
your delivery harder.

431
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,880
Mistress...

432
00:19:30,199 --> 00:19:31,599
I am so thirsty.

433
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:35,880
It has been two hours

434
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:37,719
and it's not her first time.

435
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:39,199
Why isn't it out yet?

436
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:41,800
Don't be anxious, Mistress. Did you forget?

437
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,520
When you gave birth to the Fourth Sister,

438
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,119
it took a whole day too.

439
00:19:45,199 --> 00:19:48,040
And you got through it nice and sound anyway.

440
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,640
Miss! Miss, this is bad.

441
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,280
Nanny has gone missing!

442
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:51,839
What?

443
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,199
I showed the nanny the way to the kitchen

444
00:19:53,199 --> 00:19:54,359
and we almost got there,

445
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,680
but when we made a turn after the long hallway,

446
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,439
I found

447
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,199
that the nanny disappeared suddenly!

448
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,239
That whore.

449
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:02,800
She must be scared of getting implicated and fled.

450
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:05,959
What's taking so long for the hot water?

451
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,280
We must get it for drinking and using now.

452
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Is there any more food?

453
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,520
Mistress Wei is almost out of energy!

454
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,920
That bunch of cheap slaves.

455
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,439
They can't even boil water in time?

456
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,520
Zhulou. She's rushing them.

457
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,119
Those cheap whores in the main kitchen!

458
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,359
If they don't hurry up more,

459
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:19,359
they will be flogged twenty strokes

460
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:20,520
and sold to the brothel!

461
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:22,719
Let them be riddled with problems then!

462
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:23,439
Don't worry.

463
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,000
Sixth Sister!

464
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,199
Stop this wild madness.

465
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:30,000
Xiaotao, take our Sixth Sister

466
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,400
to play with Fourth Sister. Hurry up!

467
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,359
Sixth Sister.

468
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,199
Mother. Mother.

469
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:39,439
Mother, come to take a bite.

470
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:43,760
Why are you so anxious?

471
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,000
She's out of energy for labor

472
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,400
and she should eat some cakes.

473
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:48,800
That's all very natural.

474
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:50,400
I...

475
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,119
Mistress, breathe.

476
00:20:55,439 --> 00:20:56,520
Use more strength later.

477
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,599
The rag is rancid.

478
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:02,599
Take it out to air it out.

479
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,640
Quick, have a bite.

480
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,000
The midwife.

481
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,680
Go find the midwife.

482
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,119
The midwife said she wanted to boil water

483
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:19,280
and then ran away!

484
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:20,520
We haven't seen her since.

485
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,640
It's too late then.

486
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,839
Too late.

487
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,839
Mother.

488
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:31,439
Take another bite.

489
00:21:31,439 --> 00:21:32,880
Get some energy.

490
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:39,839
Go...

491
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:41,000
Go to the Madam's.

492
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,079
Look for Nanny Zhao or Nanny Li.

493
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,119
They are elders.

494
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,719
They understand delivery.

495
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,479
Go now.

496
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:53,199
I will definitely find someone and bring her back.

497
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,880
Nanny Zhao!

498
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,839
Nanny Li!

499
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:31,959
What's wrong, Sixth Sister?

500
00:22:31,959 --> 00:22:33,160
Nanny Li's grandchild is sick.

501
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,079
She has gone home.

502
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,400
What about Nanny Zhao?

503
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,439
Miss Guan of the kitchen

504
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:37,520
invited her to go drinking

505
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,400
and she's not back yet.

506
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:51,839
Well...

507
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:55,119
Xiaotao, well...

508
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:55,959
Sixth Sister!

509
00:22:56,479 --> 00:22:58,479
What are you trying to do?

510
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,160
Nanny Zhao! Nanny Zhao!

511
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,160
Sixth Sister is here again?

512
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,439
A bucket of water has already been delivered!

513
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:17,199
Nanny Zhao!

514
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:19,359
What's that smell?

515
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:23,280
She coveted my green plum wine,

516
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,479
and she's drunk now.

517
00:23:25,439 --> 00:23:28,199
Sixth Sister, why are you looking for her?

518
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:37,479
It's raining. It's raining!

519
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,239
I'm the Jade Emperor's fairy,

520
00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:40,800
I will punish you for your offenses!

521
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,479
Quick, support her in standing up.

522
00:23:44,479 --> 00:23:45,239
Hurry!

523
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:56,479
Are you all dead?

524
00:23:56,479 --> 00:23:57,880
Just watching?

525
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,400
Hurry.

526
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,520
Let's go.

527
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:11,280
Quick.

528
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,079
Hurry up.

529
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:21,000
It's raining. It's raining!

530
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,520
It's raining.

531
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:25,319
Nanny Zhao!

532
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:26,239
Nanny Zhao!

533
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,000
The hot soup and the rolling rain!

534
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,439
Nanny Zhao! Nanny Zhao!

535
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:29,560
The hot soup and the rolling rain!

536
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:30,719
Nanny Zhao!

537
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,599
It's raining.

538
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:32,760
Nanny Zhao!

539
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,280
Don't go, Fairy!

540
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,800
Nanny Zhao!

541
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,719
Excuse me, Miss.

542
00:25:27,719 --> 00:25:29,319
Who is the most skilled gynecological physician in the city?

543
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,000
Longevity Hall, Lute Alley .

544
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:47,479
Minglan! Minglan!

545
00:25:48,959 --> 00:25:50,000
What's wrong? Who bullied you?

546
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,920
I need to go to Longevity Hall.

547
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:54,520
Get in the carriage now!

548
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:02,800
Move aside.

549
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,160
Hurry up.

550
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,319
Quick.

551
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,079
Move aside.

552
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:21,280
Hurry up.

553
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,199
Move aside.

554
00:26:24,439 --> 00:26:25,280
Stop the carriage!

555
00:26:30,959 --> 00:26:31,880
Untie the horse for me.

556
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:46,959
Hurry and find a fast horse to brace on

557
00:26:46,959 --> 00:26:47,959
and go to Longevity Hall to fetch the physician.

558
00:26:58,719 --> 00:26:59,719
Where is the physician?

559
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:01,479
Hurry and save a life!

560
00:27:01,479 --> 00:27:02,439
He's at the back having his afternoon nap.

561
00:27:02,439 --> 00:27:03,479
Sit over there and wait for him.

562
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:07,839
Master Physician! Master Physician!

563
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,520
Where did that monkey come from

564
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,280
to make such loud ruckus?

565
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:12,560
Hurry and save a life!

566
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:13,880
Hurry up. Leave now.

567
00:27:14,479 --> 00:27:15,760
Don't wake him up.

568
00:27:15,959 --> 00:27:17,839
Come, leave.

569
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:18,719
Lord Magistrate Sheng's house.

570
00:27:18,719 --> 00:27:19,839
May the physician hurry and save a life!

571
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,959
The physician is inside!

572
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,599
Somebody help!

573
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:24,479
You can't barge in.

574
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:25,119
I'm warning you!

575
00:27:26,439 --> 00:27:27,439
Master.

576
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:28,520
I'll go get a prescription first.

577
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,920
Get my medicine box!

578
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:30,640
Don't just stand there.

579
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,719
It's child delivery. Go!

580
00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:34,319
This...this horse?

581
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,520
Get on the horse!

582
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:46,040
Take care, Master.

583
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:48,439
This is Magistrate Sheng's daughter.

584
00:27:48,439 --> 00:27:49,160
Watch her well for me.

585
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,319
My carriage will come to fetch her.

586
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:52,079
Bring the medicine

587
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:52,959
and bring two clerks

588
00:27:52,959 --> 00:27:53,800
to come to Sheng House.

589
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,760
This thing with your house is no small matter.

590
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,560
Open the door!

591
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:35,119
These old bones of mine

592
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:37,119
are all jolted to pieces.

593
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:40,000
I usually only ride on donkeys.

594
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,599
This horse is too high. Too high!

595
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:51,239
What are you doing?

596
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:32,880
Isn't that the act of a burglar?

597
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:38,400
In broad daylight? Climbing over the wall?

598
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,359
Ridiculous.

599
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,599
The door is open.

600
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,079
Master Doctor,

601
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:57,199
let's go!

602
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,359
Slow down.

603
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,280
You old turd!

604
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,599
How dare you barge into women's inner chambers.

605
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:07,160
You're just a common man

606
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,560
and how dare you barge into an official's manor?

607
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,599
Attendants! Come quickly

608
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:11,439
and take this man to the Magistrate.

609
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:32,920
I'm from the Gu's, the Marquis Manor of Dongjing.

610
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,880
You'd better not mistake me for somebody else.

611
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,000
in full broad daylight,

612
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,920
you speak nothing but nonsense.

613
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,479
Let the physician go in.

614
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,439
You can't.

615
00:30:43,439 --> 00:30:44,160
It's a woman's matter.

616
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,839
How can we let a male physician come in?

617
00:30:50,479 --> 00:30:52,040
Her breathing is so weak.

618
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,880
It's already too late

619
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,839
even if I go in now!

620
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,760
You're a man. What are you trying to do?

621
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,400
Are you trying to taint the woman's honor?

622
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,239
You must preserve the woman in labor!

623
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:09,880
Move aside.

624
00:31:25,959 --> 00:31:27,400
Pitiful child.

625
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,640
Go and see your mother now.

626
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,359
Mother.

627
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,599
Sixth Sister.

628
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,640
Child, I can't work a miracle.

629
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,119
When I came,

630
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:40,439
it was already too late.

631
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,000
The child is too big and it can't be born.

632
00:31:43,199 --> 00:31:44,479
It just dragged your mother to death

633
00:31:44,479 --> 00:31:45,800
along with it.

634
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:47,880
You called me here too late!

635
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,239
The baby in her belly won't be able to make it too.

636
00:31:52,439 --> 00:31:53,280
Child, look at your mother.

637
00:31:58,319 --> 00:31:59,199
Mother.

638
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,400
Come here.

639
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,280
Lady,

640
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,479
I'll prick a few needles in you.

641
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,760
Breathe

642
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,640
and whatever you want to say, say it slowly.

643
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,199
Mother.

644
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,920
Mother.

645
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,400
Mother.

646
00:32:42,479 --> 00:32:44,040
I don't have much time left.

647
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:48,640
I'm so cold.

648
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,000
Warmer?

649
00:32:58,359 --> 00:32:59,439
It has been tough for you.

650
00:33:02,199 --> 00:33:03,680
How did you find the physician?

651
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:06,800
I ran into the Young Master

652
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,640
who played pot-pitching with me.

653
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,280
Second Master Gu.

654
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,280
He rode the horse.

655
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,680
And on his horse, he brought the physician here.

656
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,520
You must thank him properly.

657
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,160
That knee guard.

658
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,599
I've already finished embroidering it.

659
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:29,359
Take that and give it to Master Bai.

660
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,680
He helped you.

661
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,880
You must thank him.

662
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,640
Right?

663
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,839
Alright.

664
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,439
I don't have anything much else either.

665
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,959
That scroll, with Lady Li guarding over Niangzi Pass.

666
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:54,160
I embroidered it well.

667
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:57,520
I'll leave it to you.

668
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,880
Alright, Mother.

669
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,399
How pitiful you're so little.

670
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,840
And you have to survive

671
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,040
in this courtyard.

672
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,560
I keep telling you,

673
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,840
don't stand out.

674
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,760
You just refused to listen to me.

675
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,719
I was wrong.

676
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:32,159
I will listen to you in the future.

677
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,679
I will listen to you.

678
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,800
Remember this.

679
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,959
Look at me.

680
00:34:46,479 --> 00:34:47,439
In all things,

681
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:52,280
survival is of the utmost importance.

682
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,199
Did you hear me?

683
00:35:00,479 --> 00:35:03,479
Mother, I will remember.

684
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:07,080
I will always remember this.

685
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,639
What did you call me?

686
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,080
I can't bear to call you that.

687
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,800
I don't want to call you "Mistress".

688
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:30,919
Mistress...

689
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,919
Mistress Wei.

690
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,040
Well done.

691
00:35:45,399 --> 00:35:46,879
That's good.

692
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,280
When I'm no longer with you in the future,

693
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:57,320
you will be left alone

694
00:35:58,959 --> 00:36:01,479
in this courtyard.

695
00:36:03,479 --> 00:36:05,520
You will be the alone.

696
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:09,399
Your daughter will go to Grandmother's.

697
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:12,239
Alright.

698
00:36:25,479 --> 00:36:28,399
Mother! Mother!

699
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:34,320
Mother! Mother!

700
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:40,360
Mother! Mother...

701
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,840
From now on,

702
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,399
I will never have Mistress Wei.

703
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,439
I don't have my birth mother either.

704
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:57,679
You will be alone in the future.

705
00:37:57,679 --> 00:37:58,639
You must cherish yourself.

706
00:38:06,919 --> 00:38:07,800
Ming Lan!

707
00:38:07,879 --> 00:38:08,959
Sixth Sister!

708
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:10,399
Minglan!

709
00:38:10,439 --> 00:38:11,120
Let me see.

710
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,199
Go and get water now.

711
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:13,919
Hurry and get help!

712
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:14,600
Get some towel.

713
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,239
Get my medicines!

714
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,239
You dumb bastard!

715
00:38:35,879 --> 00:38:38,000
How many maidservants do we have that we needed

716
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,199
that midwife to go

717
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:40,159
and tend to the water?

718
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,360
She bullied you

719
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,040
for being born such a fool!

720
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,439
You even believed such lies?

721
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,360
Lin Qinshuang

722
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,560
was your superficial master,

723
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,159
but I'm your real boss!

724
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:55,520
In this family,

725
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,959
you're a lead maidservant.

726
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:57,959
Yet you didn't order others,

727
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,080
but you went and got yourself controlled

728
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,439
by that whore?

729
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,000
You are a damned fool!

730
00:39:04,439 --> 00:39:05,239
Why didn't your parents

731
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:06,239
give you half a brain at least?

732
00:39:10,919 --> 00:39:11,560
Mother.

733
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,000
You are here.

734
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,280
I have something to say to my mother.

735
00:39:17,959 --> 00:39:18,840
Tell her to leave first.

736
00:39:19,919 --> 00:39:20,600
Get lost!

737
00:39:29,919 --> 00:39:30,679
I haven't cried yet.

738
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:32,080
Why are you crying?

739
00:39:32,439 --> 00:39:33,000
Cool down.

740
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,280
Listen to that.

741
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,560
Such mess like cow manure!

742
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,360
I exhausted myself

743
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,399
to stuff her into Lin Qinshuang's courtyard.

744
00:39:42,959 --> 00:39:44,280
But she was so useless,

745
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,639
and gave me this instead!

746
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:46,959
She's forcing me

747
00:39:46,959 --> 00:39:48,280
to see the King of Hell soon.

748
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:03,080
I'm innocent, Master.

749
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,159
She's my servant.

750
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:06,159
It's all my fault.

751
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:07,760
Please tell Dongrong not to beat her anymore.

752
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,120
Tell him to stop.

753
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:10,120
Master.

754
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,120
That damned midwife!

755
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,000
Beat her!

756
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:16,360
I'm wrongly accused, Master.

757
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,600
Beat her until the number is complete!

758
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,479
Master, I finished twenty strokes of flogging.

759
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,199
Useless whore!

760
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,760
Drag her out and give her back to her parents!

761
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:46,840
May your anger dissipate, Master.

762
00:40:54,399 --> 00:40:55,639
Master. Mistress.

763
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:57,760
It's totally my fault.

764
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,040
I am young and inexperienced.

765
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:02,120
I just didn't know that

766
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,399
a baby that big

767
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,439
couldn't be born.

768
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,479
I failed to save Sister Wei.

769
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,239
May your anger be dissipated, Master.

770
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:17,159
May your anger be dissipated, Master.

771
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,320
May your anger be dissipated, Master.

772
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,879
Mistress Lin!

773
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,439
Shuang'er. Shuang'er!

774
00:41:26,879 --> 00:41:27,760
What's wrong, Shuang'er?

775
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:30,120
Get the physician.

776
00:41:30,399 --> 00:41:31,000
Yes.

777
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:34,760
Shuang'er. Shuang'er.

778
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:36,600
How are you going to arrange

779
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,280
Mistress Wei's funeral?

780
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,120
She was just a concubine sold here.

781
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,560
What funeral?

782
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,879
Just go and order a coffin from the street.

783
00:41:47,439 --> 00:41:48,719
In consideration of her death being a result

784
00:41:49,479 --> 00:41:50,919
from her trying to expand Sheng House's heirs.

785
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,280
Find a scribe with good penmanship to write a tablet,

786
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,159
and give her parents' family five a quarter kilo of silver.

787
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:56,439
Have Mother Liu arrange it.

788
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,239
But Mother,

789
00:41:58,239 --> 00:41:59,560
as the Madam of this family,

790
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,639
arranging the concubine's funeral personally

791
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:02,679
is the approach.

792
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,120
Or else the word will get out,

793
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:06,159
and Sheng family's reputation

794
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:07,280
will be unsightly.

795
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,239
Fine then.

796
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:12,360
I'll make myself an example

797
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,280
to that whore.

798
00:42:13,879 --> 00:42:14,439
Let her see

799
00:42:14,479 --> 00:42:16,399
what it means to be the Madam of a house!

800
00:42:18,399 --> 00:42:19,159
By the way, Hua'er,

801
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:20,959
This time when I went back,

802
00:42:20,959 --> 00:42:21,879
your uncle gave me

803
00:42:21,879 --> 00:42:22,600
two strands of pearls.

804
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,159
Mother, sit down now.

805
00:42:25,879 --> 00:42:27,199
Forget the pearls.

806
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,439
Just listen to me.

807
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,239
You must not throw any tantrums

808
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:32,600
in the courtyard in the future.

809
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:34,840
If father comes to look for you,

810
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,439
you just say

811
00:42:36,439 --> 00:42:38,239
how pitiful Mistress Wei was and how unlucky.

812
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,600
As for the rest, don't say anything.

813
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:43,080
Then...

814
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,120
I shouldn't ask for the keys to manage the house?

815
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,840
Don't ever talk about this.

816
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,840
We should console father

817
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,439
during this period.

818
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,959
That whore Lin Qinshuang

819
00:42:51,959 --> 00:42:53,600
caused this havoc.

820
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:54,439
Why can't I ride on this chance

821
00:42:54,439 --> 00:42:56,840
to get back the house keys?

822
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,320
Mother, listen to my advice.

823
00:42:58,399 --> 00:42:59,159
These days,

824
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,840
don't think about packing up

825
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,719
and the trip to Dongjing.

826
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:04,280
Just keep your devotion

827
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,679
into managing the funeral.

828
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,679
How should I do it?

829
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,479
Bury the Mistress Wei generously.

830
00:43:12,879 --> 00:43:14,320
Treat Mistress Wei's family generously.

831
00:43:24,479 --> 00:43:25,120
Did Master ask me

832
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:25,959
for the keys?

833
00:43:26,959 --> 00:43:27,639
It's not that.

834
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,040
Master hired

835
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,239
a new physician for you.

836
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,719
Dongrong is with him.

837
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,760
Waiting outside the door.

838
00:43:35,479 --> 00:43:36,360
Invite him in now.

839
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,919
Zulou and Ms Gan's are grateful.

840
00:43:42,399 --> 00:43:43,600
This is their gratitude.

841
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:46,600
It's just my duty.

842
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,239
You don't need to bother.

843
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:54,719
Mistress Wei's family sent someone here.
