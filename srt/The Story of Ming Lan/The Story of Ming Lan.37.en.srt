00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,675
The Story of Minglan

2
00:00:59,675 --> 00:01:01,525
Episode 37

3
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,880
Sixth Sister,

4
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,480
whenever I see Molan,

5
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,240
I will

6
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,020
champ with rape,

7
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,200
I would like to think,

8
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,600
Why she has such a good fate

9
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,075
of being able to be married to Brother Jing?

10
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,080
Afterward, when something happened to her,

11
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,960
I was quite happy.

12
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,440
But then,

13
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,800
I also started to worry.

14
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,120
I worried that Brother Jing would look down on

15
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,440
the daughters in our family.

16
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,375
Fifth Sister,

17
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:41,000
have you ever thought

18
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,360
that he might just want to climb the social ladder?

19
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,775
After seeing how his marriage

20
00:01:46,775 --> 00:01:47,840
with Fourth Sister ended in vain,

21
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,520
then he turned to you.

22
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,770
I know what you mean.

23
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,880
You want to say that

24
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,720
I'm always not that clever,

25
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,240
I just rely on the fact that

26
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,160
I'm a legitimate daughter,

27
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,600
rely on my good family background.

28
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,811
What Brother Jing values

29
00:02:03,811 --> 00:02:04,680
is the Sheng Family,

30
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,200
he doesn't really love me .

31
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,360
That's not what I mean.

32
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,520
From a little girl to now,

33
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,480
I had neither

34
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,480
elegant and poised characteristic of Eldest Sister

35
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,530
nor the fawning skills of Molan.

36
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,440
Even more, I'm not like you,

37
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,840
you who are so adorable.

38
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,720
Not only Father,

39
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,120
but even Mother doesn't like me.

40
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,560
Nonsense!

41
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,480
Fifth Sister, you are Big Madam's favorite.

42
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:27,875
Since little,

43
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:29,160
you've always been able to do what you want.

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,625
Do things wantonly to your heart's content,

45
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:32,040
so carefree.

46
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,560
In our house,

47
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,975
everyone has a

48
00:02:34,975 --> 00:02:36,240
crystal-clear and cold heart

49
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,080
and full of craft and cunning.

50
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,640
Only you were able to live

51
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,980
in a straightforward and unrestrained manner.

52
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,760
This is the heavens doting on you.

53
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,940
You don't have to make me happy.

54
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,720
I'm not.

55
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,360
You don't know

56
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,320
how much I admire you.

57
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,070
Only you do.

58
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,040
Wait, now there's also Brother Jing.

59
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,320
Fifth Sister, have you ever thought that

60
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,360
even if Brother Wen

61
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,520
passes the palace civil examination twice,

62
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,800
Big Madam might still not agree your marriage?

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,020
He was rejected by Fourth Sister after all,

64
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,380
yet you still treated him like a treasure.

65
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,160
Won't Big Madam

66
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,480
get crazily mad?

67
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,400
So what?

68
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,360
If she forces me,

69
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,190
I'll just hit my head to die.

70
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,860
Don't!

71
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,710
Sixth Sister, you don't know

72
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,520
when someone

73
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,760
is in your heart,

74
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,400
you're able

75
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,900
to do anything,

76
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,080
and you won't think of

77
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,120
the consequences.

78
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,010
You're my little sister,

79
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,270
so you must stand by my side.

80
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,080
Of course I support you.

81
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,160
But how can I help you?

82
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,640
If I bring up this marriage,

83
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,860
won't Big Madam beat me to death?

84
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,960
No need to.

85
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,760
Just keep my secret.

86
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,320
If you leak it out,

87
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,360
I will never admit it,

88
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,520
and then frame you this!

89
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,280
That would be nice,

90
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:02,920
I'll then just

91
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,960
marry Brother Wen!

92
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,080
Anyway, the person choose by

93
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,800
Father and Second Brother

94
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,440
will surely be a good person.

95
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,160
How dare you!

96
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,350
You dare?

97
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,300
I dare to.

98
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,030
Wait.

99
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,960
What's this?

100
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,480
Just choose one.

101
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,800
You can take whatever you like.

102
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,630
I like them all.

103
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,760
Then take them all.

104
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,720
Silly sister, using money to keep someone silence

105
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,200
will never work.

106
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,920
I promise you that I won't say it to anyone.

107
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,920
I just feel that

108
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,120
this path won't be easy.

109
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,120
I'm worried about you.

110
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,840
No need to worry.

111
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,360
I've thought about it.

112
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,280
Even if it's an abyss ahead,

113
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,400
I will still jump in.

114
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,600
You should be like me.

115
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,320
If you meet

116
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,760
such a situation in the future,

117
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,950
don't let go.

118
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,120
There are things that are worthy to be fought for.

119
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,560
I'm currently

120
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,940
not in the mood to fight.

121
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,520
What do you mean by that?

122
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,480
Let me make this clear,

123
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,525
that there's no room for my Ming'er

124
00:05:50,525 --> 00:05:52,320
suffering any grievances.

125
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,625
I'm just thinking about

126
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,960
the condition of Hong'er's mother.

127
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,475
Her protracted illness

128
00:06:04,475 --> 00:06:06,595
makes her to just be half-alive.

129
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,440
Since she cake from the Cao family,

130
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,400
she got much better.

131
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,680
Now, she can already sit up.

132
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,600
At this moment,

133
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,520
if I let her

134
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,560
breaks off with her maiden family,

135
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,160
won't that kill her?

136
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,240
Her illness

137
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,760
didn't happen just now.

138
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,460
If I'm the one to decide,

139
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,040
I will definitely throw

140
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,160
that troublesome Cao girl out.

141
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,440
It's just that

142
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,520
Hong'er can't fight with his mother.

143
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,857
He was afraid that

144
00:06:43,857 --> 00:06:44,880
something bad might happen to her.

145
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,640
I'm unable to meddle in your family's affair.

146
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,160
But I made an oath.

147
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,480
I will never allow Ming

148
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,080
to suffer the difficulties I had.

149
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,320
Don't worry.

150
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,400
Their time is running out.

151
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,520
Informing two Old Madams,

152
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,120
Big Madam already known

153
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,760
Miss Sheng is here.

154
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,080
But she said that she's sick in bed,

155
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,080
so it's not convenient for her to see any guests.

156
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,430
Hope Old Madam Sheng can understand.

157
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,560
So what?

158
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,160
We'll go visit her.

159
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,840
Big Madam also said,

160
00:07:19,075 --> 00:07:20,720
there's no need to disturb Old Madam Sheng.

161
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,080
She just misses Miss Sheng a lot

162
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,320
and wants to have a chat with her.

163
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,920
You go then.

164
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,040
Minglan.

165
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,920
Come here.

166
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,600
Good child.

167
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,120
You.

168
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,000
You.

169
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,520
Kind Miss,

170
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,920
my Jin'er really

171
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,440
has her back to the wall now.

172
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,120
We just hoped Hong'er

173
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,880
could provide her a place to stay

174
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,840
for the sake that we're relatives.

175
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,520
Even poor families

176
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,960
take dogs or cats in.

177
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,120
That day, I babbled some nonsense.

178
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,600
Sister Jinxiu,

179
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,800
please don't mind.

180
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:44,960
When I went back,

181
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,800
my grandmother already rebuked me.

182
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,680
Those was just some jokes that

183
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,080
elders would usually tell,

184
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,360
no big deal.

185
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,240
It's not my thing

186
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,360
to meddle about

187
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,275
who Brother Hong wants to take in

188
00:08:55,275 --> 00:08:56,025
as his concubine.

189
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,640
That's right.

190
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,920
The marriage of a girl

191
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,880
is always up to her future Mother-in-law.

192
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,500
It's usual for a man

193
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,290
to have wives and concubines.

194
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,440
My little sister just too generous,

195
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,630
so that other people become unappreciative

196
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,030
of her good intentions.

197
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,320
Once you marry him,

198
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,720
are you going to let Hong'er

199
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,480
have just one wife?

200
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,640
Then after Brother Hong marry Sister Cao,

201
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,360
may I ask Big Madam,

202
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,440
you'll be the birth mother of a concubine

203
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,840
or an elderly relative of the Cao family?

204
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,600
The role of you

205
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,240
is a very serious thing.

206
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,440
Of course, we're relatives.

207
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,400
Of course, I'm an elder of you.

208
00:09:43,465 --> 00:09:44,740
Yes.

209
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,040
If you're an elder,

210
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,800
I have to respect

211
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,640
and serve you.

212
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,640
If you're the birth mother of a concubine,

213
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,200
then you're a servant.

214
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,160
If I'm in a good mood,

215
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,960
I'll just give you some money.

216
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,480
If I'm not,

217
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,880
I can just kick you out of the house.

218
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,000
If it's not clear

219
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,080
she is a concubine

220
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,702
or a relative,

221
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:07,940
how would mother and daughter-in-law,

222
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,360
husband and wife,

223
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,900
even the legitimate and illegitimate children

224
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,720
interact with each other?.

225
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,400
Just a big mess.

226
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,560
You brat!

227
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,120
Just because you are from a god family,

228
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,400
you bitch, you think you..

229
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,110
Aunt.

230
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,375
May Auntie act appropriately.

231
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:53,280
I, and the whole He Family,

232
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,880
have already be very benevolent to the Cao Family.

233
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,240
We have a clear conscience.

234
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,160
We never complained

235
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,600
in helping you with money or effort.

236
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,460
Just one thing,

237
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,550
we won't allow anyone to blackmail us.

238
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,200
My poor daughter!

239
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,360
your parents ruin your future.

240
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,760
I initially thought after return to the capital,

241
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,840
your cousin will take care of you.

242
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,760
Never thought that the world has changed.

243
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:27,640
He has become a social climber!

244
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,760
Daughter, it's better that

245
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,520
you just die with me!

246
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,890
Forget it.

247
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,160
So shame that you have

248
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,470
such an ungrateful auntie

249
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,400
and cousin!

250
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,575
Little sister,

251
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,325
I,

252
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,360
I do want to take my niece

253
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,280
into our family.

254
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,330
Don't be afraid with me around.

255
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,920
I'm not afraid.

256
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,775
Big Madam Cao

257
00:12:18,775 --> 00:12:20,280
has some guests here.

258
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,080
Don't try to get up.

259
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,480
Lie down and rest.

260
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,650
Lie down.

261
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,540
Why are you still here?

262
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,575
Earlier,

263
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,360
Auntie Cao said that she wants to have

264
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,240
Sister Jinxiu become Brother Hong's concubine.

265
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,880
Although this has nothing to do with me,

266
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,400
I did hear something about it.

267
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,520
Look at my granddaughter,

268
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,170
totally treat herself as a part of this family.

269
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:58,320
won't people laugh their heads off if they know this?

270
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,200
Elder Sister,

271
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,360
Ming'er is your granddaughter,

272
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,680
I also consider her as mine.

273
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,360
She's like a little sister to Hong'er.

274
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,600
It's just fine her to listen

275
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,000
to our family matters.

276
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,830
Grandmother, what are you taking about?

277
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,680
Shut up.

278
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,160
In this room

279
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,480
we can take this as a joke.

280
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:23,880
If other people knows,

281
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,320
I really don't know what will they think

282
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,840
I heard that

283
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,320
for those exiled officers and their families,

284
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,600
even if they are pardoned

285
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,280
they must return to their home province.

286
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,200
Returning to the capital

287
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,520
without permission is a serious crime.

288
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,240
But from the look of it,

289
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,360
if not because His Majesty made a decree

290
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,360
and amended the law, giving out graces,

291
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,200
this allows the Cao family

292
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,370
not only able to return to the capital,

293
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,400
but also be taken care of by their relatives.

294
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,660
It's getting late.

295
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,600
Ming'er, we should go back now.

296
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,280
No!

297
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,200
Grandmother,

298
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,000
how comes you

299
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,240
talked something about

300
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,880
we being brother and sister earlier?

301
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,280
Didn't we have

302
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,480
an agreement before

303
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,800
Pick my mother from the village,

304
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,840
then propose to Miss Sheng,

305
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,050
and make betrothal with the Sheng Family

306
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,040
on the fifteenth next month?

307
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,470
And hold our wedding ceremony

308
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,040
in the early summer next year?

309
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:53,720
Forget about it.

310
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,520
Stop daydreaming.

311
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,680
Old Madam Sheng said

312
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,800
her granddaughter

313
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,200
is an outsider.

314
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,440
This marriage

315
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,560
is over.

316
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,600
But I've already made my mind

317
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,720
not to marry my cousin.

318
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,040
Doesn't Old Madam Sheng know?

319
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,920
I'll go explain this clearly to her now.

320
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,425
Come back.

321
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,300
It's all my fault.

322
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,360
I considered that your mother

323
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,000
only had this younger sister of hers

324
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,880
as a relative left.

325
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:34,560
Even if I don't like the Cao Family,

326
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,560
I didn't say anything.

327
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,300
You should also be blamed!

328
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,640
You knew that your mother

329
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,240
was a person who can't discern right from wrong

330
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,480
and doesn't have foresight.

331
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,000
You didn't even correct her before.

332
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,560
What happened today

333
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,520
was handled so badly!

334
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,520
I can't save it anymore.

335
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,600
In their Sheng Family,

336
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,400
it's always Old Madam Sheng to make decisions.

337
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:07,000
Minglan is her favorite granddaughter.

338
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,480
If she refuses Minglan to marry you,

339
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,800
even if you beg His Majesty, it won't work.

340
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,400
Where are you going?

341
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,550
Grandmother, what you said earlier was so right.

342
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,400
I've known very earlier

343
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,640
that the Cao family aren't good relatives,

344
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:30,640
yet I allowed Mother

345
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,760
to spoil them.

346
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,224
As they say,

347
00:16:33,224 --> 00:16:34,225
a mother spoiling his son

348
00:16:34,225 --> 00:16:35,370
is like she is killing him.

349
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,560
I spoiled my mother,

350
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,850
came out made the whole family suffer.

351
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,440
Mother is also unable to

352
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,280
enjoy any peaceful days.

353
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,200
For the He Family,

354
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,525
I must end this matter.

355
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,880
Are you doing this for the He Family

356
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,440
or the Sheng Family?

357
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,000
Termites can bore through dikes.

358
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,120
I'm doing it for the He Family,

359
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:59,160
and also for the Sheng Family.

360
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,240
I know what you want.

361
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,120
You'd rather have a faithful husband

362
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,520
who will never leave you.

363
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,120
Not saying the masters,

364
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,720
even servants have to marry

365
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,640
someone who knows each other

366
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,760
for their life to be better.

367
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,160
I'm just angry.

368
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,720
The more I think about it the angrier I get.

369
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:30,750
What?

370
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,280
Just because I'm not as pitiful as she is,

371
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,480
then I have to make concession?

372
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,040
In this world,

373
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,200
the person who is more pitiful,

374
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,200
is more reasonable?

375
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,160
Earlier, when He Hongwen

376
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,760
saw us off,

377
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,240
he made a promise that

378
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,400
he won't marry that Cao woman as a concubine.

379
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,240
Made a promise?

380
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,040
Will that work?

381
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,720
How many people can really fulfill their promises?

382
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,160
As long as his mother begs him,

383
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,040
Brother Hong is relentingly.

384
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,360
He can't watch

385
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,640
his mother dies from anger.

386
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,240
Okay.

387
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,680
We'll just go and look at

388
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,080
other people then.

389
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,600
Hurry!

390
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,320
Come. Come.

391
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,400
Sit.

392
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,640
Fifth Sister,

393
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,800
can you let me take a breather first?

394
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,900
I didn't eat yet.

395
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,850
You didn't eat?

396
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,480
Xique!

397
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,120
Tell the kitchen

398
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,360
to make some dishes

399
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,520
for Sixth Sister.

400
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:48,800
Yes.

401
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,070
Today, Xique went out to deliver some thing,

402
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,640
then accidentally heard Nanny Liu saying

403
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,200
Mother is arranging my marriage.

404
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,920
Which family?

405
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,160
My uncle's.

406
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,080
It is to be expected.

407
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:07,960
You are clever,

408
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,960
please help me

409
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,280
think a way

410
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,040
to make my mother drop this idea.

411
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,680
How can I have any idea?

412
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,740
How would I dare

413
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,240
How would I dare mention your things

414
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,120
in front of Big Madam?

415
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,800
Then you go to

416
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,360
Go talk to Grandmother.

417
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,920
She always doesn't

418
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,440
really like me,

419
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,120
but you are her favorite.

420
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:28,960
If you talk to her,

421
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,600
she might be able to help me.

422
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,840
If it's other things,

423
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,840
she might can really help.

424
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,760
But this is your marriage.

425
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,510
If they don't let Big Madam to decide,

426
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,600
she might tear our house apart!

427
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:43,520
She might not listen to Grandmother's either.

428
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,760
Then she still can

429
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,440
give her some advice, right?

430
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,950
You don't know how mediocre my cousins are.

431
00:19:55,425 --> 00:19:57,240
And that auntie of mine,

432
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,640
she has always disliked

433
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,840
my mother and her other sisters-in-law.

434
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,240
The food is already ready?

435
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,760
You don't not even care about my matter!

436
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:10,960
What's going on?

437
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,080
What did you hear?

438
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,040
Did my aunt come here

439
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,560
for my wedding?

440
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,520
Doesn't sound like it.

441
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,640
I heard that she's here

442
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,620
to congrats Old Madam Wang's birthday,

443
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,000
that's why she goes for Big Madam.

444
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:21,400
Really?

445
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,680
I was so scared.

446
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:26,840
That aunt of mine

447
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,320
is unable to achieve anything but spoil things,

448
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,520
but she just happens to be my mother's sister,

449
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,560
so I can't ignore her.

450
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:35,280
Auntie Kang is always like that,

451
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,160
so stop worrying.

452
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,360
It's just

453
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,750
in terms of discussing your marriage

454
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,640
with your Wang cousin,

455
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,110
shouldn't be the person from your uncle's family comes?

456
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,720
Why is your aunt to

457
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,840
be the person who is doing this?

458
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,280
She doesn't care about that.

459
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,360
She just want to do everything.

460
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,440
Let's put it this way.

461
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,960
Even if it's raining,

462
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,920
she has to catch a few drops

463
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,280
to make tea.

464
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,280
As long as it will benefit her,

465
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,480
she surely will get involved.

466
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:01,200
Xique!

467
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:01,800
Yes.

468
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,120
Go to the maid of my aunt

469
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,600
to ask something.

470
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:05,160
See if

471
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,920
you can find out anything.

472
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,505
You have to give these people tips

473
00:21:10,505 --> 00:21:11,400
to get something.

474
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,680
Let me find you

475
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,425
some money.

476
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,320
Miss, how could you know

477
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,440
where those things are?

478
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,120
I'll just get them myself.

479
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,680
Also, those maid and house attendants

480
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,720
of my mother

481
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,520
need some

482
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,400
jewelry or something.

483
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,440
Fifth Sister,

484
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,760
that Brother Wen is from a poor family.

485
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,200
His mother is even from the countryside.

486
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,450
She might be uncultured

487
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,640
and doesn't know how to read.

488
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,360
Even if you marry him as you wish,

489
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,600
I'm afraid that

490
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,240
your future would be hard.

491
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,880
It's inevitable for you to have conflicts

492
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,160
with your mother-in-law.

493
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,560
In this world, there are hardships everywhere.

494
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,320
Like Eldest Sister.

495
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,000
She married into a count's family.

496
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,475
She and her husband

497
00:22:05,475 --> 00:22:06,240
have a harmonious relationship.

498
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,200
However,

499
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,480
she has an evil mother-in-law.

500
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,425
Doesn't she have a hard life too?

501
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:11,760
And Molan.

502
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,920
She disliked Brother Wen's family for being poor,

503
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,040
refused to marry him,

504
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,640
and insisted on marrying into a count's family.

505
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,440
But who knew that

506
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,400
she would have a miscarriage?

507
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:22,640
It must have been

508
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,640
that favorite concubine of that Sixth Liang, Chunke,

509
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,830
Chunke, who tormented her to lose her child.

510
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,520
Isn't her life hard too?

511
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,440
Fourth Sister had a miscarriage?

512
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,200
When did it happen?

513
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,480
Just some time ago.

514
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,600
Before.

515
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,840
Before,

516
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,190
whenever Fourth Sister had any suffering,

517
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,830
you would tell me right away.

518
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:40,025
How come now

519
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,760
you shut your mouth?

520
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:45,070
I now have Brother Jing.

521
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,840
I don't have the time to care about her stuff.

522
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,840
Who doesn't suffer in this world?

523
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,275
Hong'er, I'm sure you

524
00:23:01,275 --> 00:23:03,160
have important matters in coming here.

525
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,880
It's better that we talk about it first.

526
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:09,560
It was I who was slow-witted and ignorant,

527
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,600
and so I brought trouble to you and Minglan.

528
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,280
To have implicated you, Old Madam,

529
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,880
I feel very remorseful in my heart.

530
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,880
Yesterday,

531
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,560
I went to Uncle Cao's house

532
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,960
and made myself clear.

533
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,975
My mother is willing to take in my cousin

534
00:23:26,975 --> 00:23:27,800
as an adopted daughter.

535
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,725
We will invite all our clan's elders to witness.

536
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,600
From now on, we will be like real siblings.

537
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:37,200
The Cao Family

538
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,680
is really quite ruthless.

539
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:41,840
Your family,

540
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,900
has helped them a lot.

541
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,240
How can they treat you like this?

542
00:23:47,075 --> 00:23:48,305
Later,

543
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,800
Auntie ran after me as I was leaving,

544
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,240
and told me the real story.

545
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,320
Cousin Jin'er tried to suicide

546
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,520
after going home yesterday.

547
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,800
After getting saved,

548
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,320
she told the truth.

549
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,400
What truth?

550
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:01,840
Cousin said that

551
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,880
when she was a concubine in Liangzhou,

552
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,520
her Big Madam forced her

553
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,440
to drink safflower soup,

554
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,775
thus making it impossible for her

555
00:24:08,775 --> 00:24:09,400
to have children ever.

556
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,160
She was afraid that her family would get upset,

557
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,520
so she didn't tell anyone.

558
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,160
Until

559
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,078
she realized that

560
00:24:18,078 --> 00:24:19,600
there's no chance to marry into our He Family.

561
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,040
Her face is destroyed,

562
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,320
so is her body.

563
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,620
She can't have any children.

564
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,200
She indeed had nowhere else to go.

565
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,040
She indeed is a pitiful person.

566
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,840
Now that she can't have children,

567
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,920
there's no more threat.

568
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:45,640
No matter how nice Hong'er is,

569
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,160
she won't be able to cause any big trouble.

570
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,480
What do you think?

571
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,160
Even if she can have children,

572
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,560
I don't mind anymore.

573
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,400
Why did you change your mind?

574
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,520
These past days,

575
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,480
I've done a lot of muddled things.

576
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,560
Not only did I cause you to worry,

577
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,880
I even embarrassed myself.

578
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,200
I'm unfilial.

579
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,080
Young Master He

580
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:16,960
is a marriage prospect that

581
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,240
Grandmother painstakingly searched for.

582
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,720
I shouldn't easily destroy it.

583
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:22,172
Aren't you afraid of

584
00:25:22,172 --> 00:25:23,920
getting entangled with that Cao lady

585
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,200
and her family from now on?

586
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,025
In one's life,

587
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,600
you surely will meet

588
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,920
some setbacks and injustices.

589
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,760
You can't really keep avoiding potholes

590
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,000
upon seeing them, right?

591
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,280
Just like this fragrant wood.

592
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,125
It's not really something

593
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:43,040
that just grows by the sidewalk

594
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,400
and is easily obtainable.

595
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,240
You must go through a lot of danger to get it.

596
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,800
You must look for it

597
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,560
in an old forest deep in the mountains.

598
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,920
Cut the tree, and transport it out.

599
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:57,760
Along the way, you might encounter

600
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,360
landslides, flooding,

601
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,160
oppressive local officials, or bandits.

602
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,680
If you're careless,

603
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,200
all your hard work might go in vain.

604
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,840
But in the end, they will still end up in our hands.

605
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,160
Just like us.

606
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,360
We just need to live our lives day by day,

607
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,400
and it's enough.

608
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,040
Wrong.

609
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,640
This isn't the reason

610
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,600
that you changed your mind.

611
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:27,433
Never aggrieve yourself for me.

612
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,800
Grandmother, there are some things

613
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,225
that the more you see it to be good,

614
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:42,520
the more it is not.

615
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:44,400
Tell me this.

616
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,840
If we really love each other

617
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:49,280
and suddenly encounter problems,

618
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,840
I surely will be crying so hard

619
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,960
and be in great pain.

620
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,000
But looking at it now,

621
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,160
Brother He

622
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,680
actually doesn't have me in his heart,

623
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,200
I also don't love him.

624
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,960
We actually

625
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,940
just have an amicable and harmonious relationship.

626
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,320
In the future, we will definitely

627
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,440
treating each other like special guests.

628
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,880
At this young age,

629
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,320
your heart is already like an elm tree.

630
00:27:14,075 --> 00:27:15,480
You can't be like this.

631
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,480
Grandmother, don't worry.

632
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,200
I'm just thinking

633
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,720
that we can't really spend all our lives going

634
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,760
in circles

635
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,480
in our own house, right?

636
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,000
In the future,

637
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,640
I can save up a lot of money

638
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,920
and be more relaxed.

639
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,360
If I get bored, I can go travel,

640
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:36,600
play ball, go fishing, or play some board games.

641
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,118
There will always be a lot of ways

642
00:27:39,118 --> 00:27:39,440
to relieve boredom.

643
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,320
My days will be happy.

644
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,240
If just wan to

645
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,450
rely on the man,

646
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:45,560
I instead turn myself

647
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,160
into a hateful crazy woman,

648
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,360
isn't that not worth it?

649
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,360
Grandmother, is it fragrant?

650
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,040
In less than half a year,

651
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,400
we have achieved such great victory.

652
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,880
However, Uncle didn't seem happy at all.

653
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,200
Your Auntie died

654
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,120
death in Yuzhou.

655
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,400
How can he be better

656
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,040
that soon?

657
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,720
The Zou Family wants to marry their daughter

658
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,720
to Uncle as a second wife.

659
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,400
The third daughter of the Zou Family?

660
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:42,320
My Royal Father has already decided to

661
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,680
have my uncle remarry

662
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,680
with the only daughter of Duke Ying.

663
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,900
But the eldest daughter-in-law of the Zou Family died for

664
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,425
saving the Queen.

665
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:52,960
Don't look at me like that.

666
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,600
I can't interfere this.

667
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,320
Brother of queen won't agree to this.

668
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:01,760
Yes, Uncle surely will not agree to it.

669
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,680
I'm afraid that

670
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,280
something will happen.

671
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,300
Zhong Hai.

672
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,120
we are now in the capital,

673
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,440
in the capital and not in Yuzhou.

674
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,480
Whether we agree or not,

675
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,640
there are a lot of things

676
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,960
that are far beyond us.

677
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:23,560
I have to get married.

678
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,480
The sooner, the better.

679
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,520
Stop pushing me! I came here first!

680
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,930
Everyone! Everyone!

681
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,120
Everyone,

682
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:32,625
did you come here

683
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:33,610
to propose marriage to our general?

684
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:35,800
Yes! Yes!

685
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,580
Unfortunately, you were too late.

686
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,000
Our general already went out

687
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,580
to propose marriage early this morning.

688
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,320
Even if you wait for

689
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,520
our general to return,

690
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,850
you won't be able to catch up.

691
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,320
Gently.

692
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,200
Place it there.

693
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:52,640
Come, place it here.

694
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,550
Be careful.

695
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,320
All of these items

696
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,760
will be your family's in the future.

697
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,440
This.

698
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,200
Don't put it there!

699
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,560
It might get baked under the sun!

700
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,260
Did you enter the wrong house?

701
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,380
No, I'm not.

702
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,360
This

703
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,150
Even if you got promoted,

704
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,800
you don't need to be this boastful.

705
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,340
I'm not. I'm definitely not!

706
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,560
These are

707
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,240
still more coming!

708
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,080
What...

709
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:53,960
Those.

710
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,520
All for your family.

711
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,080
You are in love with one of my sisters?

712
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,560
Come. Come.

713
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:13,400
After I thought twice,

714
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,560
those people who competing to marry

715
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,520
their daughter to me,

716
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,960
used to look down on me.

717
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,010
Sit down.

718
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,800
But now, they turn 180 degree!

719
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:26,100
After wiping their faces,

720
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,275
they are now full of fawning and currying.

721
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,920
I feel that they are all people

722
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,600
working for personal gains.

723
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,750
Do you think I can

724
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,960
marry people like that?

725
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,720
Dare I?

726
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,640
But our family

727
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,400
is also not compatible

728
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:46,640
with your current status.

729
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,880
Why would I care about that?

730
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,000
Thinking about when

731
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,840
Prince Yan rebelled and surrounded the capital,

732
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,625
everyone got so afraid

733
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:56,840
that they peed in their pants.

734
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,560
Seeing the weapons of the rebels,

735
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,120
they just wanted to kneel down and surrender.

736
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,560
Only you and your father

737
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,025
didn't panic during the chaotic situation,

738
00:32:05,025 --> 00:32:06,350
faced it so calmly.

739
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,400
Just such bearing

740
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,840
is enough to impress me so much.

741
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,750
Now that the new Emperor

742
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,000
has ascended to the throne,

743
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,000
I also am having a smooth-sailing rise through the ranks.

744
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,850
Your family didn't even exert any effort

745
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:18,680
to curry my favor.

746
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:19,800
This is called,

747
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,403
never change no matter how noble

748
00:32:20,403 --> 00:32:21,680
or lowly the environment is.

749
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,500
I'm thinking that

750
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,040
if I fall from grace in the future,

751
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,000
your family will surely still be with me

752
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,720
through times of difficulties.

753
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,440
Where else can I find

754
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,880
such a good family?

755
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,720
Are you talking about our family?

756
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,720
Even I am blushing after hearing that.

757
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,925
I'm not saying

758
00:32:42,925 --> 00:32:45,360
this to you.

759
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:48,040
I get prepared

760
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,080
so you can say it to your father.

761
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,525
Those words are

762
00:32:54,525 --> 00:32:56,000
so comprehensive.

763
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,075
You didn't come up with them in a day, right?

764
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,120
Which little sister of mine

765
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,960
are you planning to marry?

766
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,030
You don't know?

767
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:10,030
You have such a complicated thought,

768
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,760
How can I know?

769
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,150
Come on, tell me.

770
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,500
Which one?

771
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:18,080
Of course, that one who is beautiful

772
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,680
and has a good character.

773
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,000
Gu Tingye said that he wants to marry Rulan.

774
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,520
Mother, be careful!

775
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,280
What? What!

776
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,000
What did you say?

777
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:47,480
Gu Tingye wants to marry Rulan?

778
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,720
Yes.

779
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,160
Second Uncle Gu said that

780
00:33:52,825 --> 00:33:54,920
Rulan is one of the highly-praised unmarried

781
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,550
rich ladies here in the capital.

782
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,010
He has seen her a few times during Polo matches.

783
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,720
He said that she's very beautiful,

784
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,700
has gracious demeanor,

785
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,240
is highly-cultured and steeped in propriety,

786
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,360
gentle and adorable.

787
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,760
He said that having her as his wife

788
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,000
will make him have no regrets in this life.

789
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,560
No. No.

790
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,000
Is he talking about Rulan?

791
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:20,800
How come it feels like

792
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,360
he's describing Minglan?

793
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,480
It is Rulan!

794
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:28,425
Although Rulan

795
00:34:28,425 --> 00:34:30,225
is a bit willful here at home,

796
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,480
but has she become unruly

797
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,760
and caused any trouble

798
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,040
when she goes out?

799
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,040
How come Gu Tingye doesn't like our Rulan?

800
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:40,080
Moreover, he's a legitimate son of a marquis

801
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,950
and currently a highly-favored person of the emperor,

802
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,040
If he marries an illegitimate daughter,

803
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,680
won't people be laughing at him?

804
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,200
It must be Rulan!

805
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,400
What do you know?

806
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,240
That Second Master Gu

807
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,840
isn't one to be trifled with.

808
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,280
Those absurd matters

809
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,610
that he has done before,

810
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:00,240
who in Bianjing doesn't know?

811
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:03,200
Would you dare marry your daughter to him?

812
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,880
Those are mostly rumors.

813
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,000
He indeed was a bit absurd before,

814
00:35:15,775 --> 00:35:17,640
but he has now mended his ways.

815
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,075
Moreover,

816
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,160
he's now an important government official.

817
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,120
Always so busy.

818
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,000
Indeed! Indeed!

819
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,320
My son has always been fair.

820
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,150
The fact that he's standing up for

821
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:28,880
Second Master Gu means that

822
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,120
he's a good choice.

823
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,440
What do you know?

824
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:36,400
You just like him

825
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,720
for his power and status.

826
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,080
How do you know that

827
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,360
he'll keep his words?

828
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,320
Zhonghuai also said

829
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:45,880
that even though a lot of people

830
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,480
are proposing marriage to him,

831
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,920
all are just fence-sitters

832
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,520
who will move where the wind blows.

833
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,320
He doesn't even give a damn about them.

834
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,300
Although the Sheng Family isn't an illustrious

835
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,880
or aristocratic family for generations,

836
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,870
we are a family of scholars.

837
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,520
He is from a warrior clan.

838
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,840
They've always admired scholarly families.

839
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:06,960
It is he who is climbing onto

840
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,560
a higher branch in marrying Rulan.

841
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,880
He said that?

842
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:15,400
I initially thought

843
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,840
he was just a rash fellow

844
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,050
who detests the ways of the world.

845
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:20,240
Just relying on some fortuitous merits,

846
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,640
and thus was able to soar up into the sky.

847
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:25,800
Never thought that he's also a reasonable person

848
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,440
with good foresight and intelligence.

849
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,080
In my opinion, this Gu Tingye

850
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:38,400
not only has foresight and intelligence,

851
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,800
he's also very blessed.

852
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,480
Otherwise, tell me

853
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,575
how could he coincidentally just be serving

854
00:36:43,575 --> 00:36:44,400
the family of the present Emperor?

855
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,200
Who cares about a relatives of the Emperor

856
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,680
that's been sent away from the capital?

857
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:47,920
It must be because

858
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,400
he's being guided by a divine star!

859
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:51,639
He surely will continue promoting.

860
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,440
Husband,

861
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,080
stop being too cautious.

862
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,680
Mother, don't be happy too fast.

863
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:59,200
For this marriage to go smoothly,

864
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,800
Rulan must agree with it first.

865
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,590
Would she refuse such a good marriage prospect?

866
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:05,475
Does she plan to go to heaven

867
00:37:05,475 --> 00:37:06,440
and marry the Heavenly Emperor?

868
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,160
Don't worry.

869
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,840
If I talk to her, she surely will agree!

870
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:12,520
It won't be that easy, I'm afraid

871
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,000
Stop knocking!

872
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,800
I won't marry!

873
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,680
I won't marry Gu Tingye even if I die!

874
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,840
Are you crazy or stupid?

875
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,360
What's wrong with that Gu Tingye?

876
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:29,480
He has power, status,

877
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,040
and unending wealth.

878
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,120
Even the Count Yongchang family

879
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,000
can't compare with him!

880
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,880
Their family only has one stepmother.

881
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,840
If you marry into his house,

882
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,275
you'll be the steward Big Madam!

883
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,035
You might even get a conferred title

884
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,160
from the Emperor in the future.

885
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,080
How glorious is that?

886
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:43,240
Mother clearly is just jealous that

887
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,280
Fourth Sister married

888
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,560
into a count's family.

889
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,200
You want to me to marry my cousin,

890
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,600
but Auntie got it first!

891
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,760
So now you want me

892
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,040
to marry Gu Tingye.

893
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,920
You say it's for me,

894
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,000
but it's really just

895
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,200
for your own dignity!

896
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,600
That Gu Tingye frequents brothels.

897
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,680
He's he's a prodigal son!

898
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,480
You want me to marry him?

899
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,240
Won't the rest of my life

900
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,520
get destroyed!

901
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,120
That's not true!

902
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,600
Your older brother has always been fair and just.

903
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,120
Have you heard

904
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,440
him lie before?

905
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,200
If Second Brother feels that

906
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,280
he's good in any aspect,

907
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,680
then why doesn't he marry him himself!

908
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,000
If that Gu Tingye is a wolf in sheep's clothing,

909
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,280
will my older brother

910
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,480
kill him for me!

911
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,000
You must really be my daughter because of my sins!

912
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:35,200
Big Madam, what should we do?

913
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:37,200
Let her have her fit first.

914
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:37,675
Once she had enough,

915
00:38:37,675 --> 00:38:38,400
we'll try to convince her again.

916
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,880
Currently, she's just too mad.

917
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,320
Once she calms down,

918
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,440
we might be able to convince her.

919
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,680
Why don't we have Sixth Miss

920
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,760
come over to convince her?

921
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,080
Why would Rulan

922
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,360
listen to her?

923
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,160
These months,

924
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,675
Sixth Miss has frequently been

925
00:38:54,675 --> 00:38:55,760
coming here to Weiruixuan.

926
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,720
I heard from Xique that

927
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,220
it was Fifth Miss had her come

928
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,274
to teach her some needlework

929
00:38:59,274 --> 00:39:00,820
and have some intimate talks.

930
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,800
Maybe because

931
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,000
Fourth Miss has married,

932
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,520
the house has become quieter.

933
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,275
These two sisters instead

934
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,460
have become closer to each other.

935
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,880
That child Rulan

936
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:09,750
has indeed come here to seek payment

937
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:10,520
for my debts in the past life!

938
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,520
How come I ended up raising her?

939
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,480
The Second Young Master of the Gu Family

940
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,640
to be in-laws with our family?

941
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,800
wants to marry my sister?

942
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,480
I heard that

943
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,400
the Eldest Young Master of the Gu Family is sickly.

944
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,600
The Second Young Master has returned

945
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,280
and is a favored of the Emperor.

946
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,280
Other families are even exhausting all means

947
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,480
to enter the doors of the Gu Family.

948
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,525
Didn't Fifth Miss always want to

949
00:39:34,525 --> 00:39:35,620
surpass Fourth Miss?

950
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,120
Now that

951
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,480
a chance to become a marquis' wife has come,

952
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,920
she instead keeps refusing.

953
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,120
This is quite strange.

954
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,160
Don't talk about it anymore.

955
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,240
This isn't our courtyard.

956
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,760
Be careful of what you say.

957
00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:48,600
Yes.

958
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,040
Stop knocking! I'm not getting married!

959
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,040
Fifth Sister, it's me.

960
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:07,320
You're here!

961
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,080
Okay. Stop crying.

962
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,680
If you keep crying and it startles Grandmother

963
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,640
She's not Big Madam.

964
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,080
She can't accept any flaws.

965
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,000
If she investigates,

966
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,080
you matter with Brother Wen

967
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,440
will get exposed.

968
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,640
You tell me what to do then.

969
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:52,270
That Gu Tingye has enormous wealth and power,

970
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:53,830
and is currently a favored subject.

971
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:55,720
With such a huge mountain coming to suppress me,

972
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,040
how can I escape?

973
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,000
Right.

974
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,480
You indeed have nowhere to escape to.

975
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,520
I asked you to come to help me come up with ideas.

976
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,440
Why are you splashing me with cold water?

977
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,040
I was asked by Big Madam

978
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:10,880
to come here to convince you.

979
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:12,075
If I don't splash you with cold water,

980
00:41:12,075 --> 00:41:13,475
should I urge

981
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,800
you and Brother Wen to elope?

982
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,365
Fourth Sister could do such things,

983
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,310
but Fifth Sister,

984
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:19,724
you've always thought about our family,

985
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,080
you would never do such a thing.

986
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,560
Of course, I wouldn't do such a thing.

987
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:26,280
My family loves me.

988
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,240
If just because of my own happiness

989
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,000
I have to disregard my parents and family,

990
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,680
then I'm not even worthy to be called a human.

991
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,360
If you really don't like

992
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,240
Second Uncle Gu,

993
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,360
you two can just

994
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,800
live in separate courtyards.

995
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,640
Gu Tingye isn't a good man.

996
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,960
How could he treat me with mutual respect?

997
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:50,200
How come you're describing him

998
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,480
like some devil?

999
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,280
Father even said that

1000
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,640
he has improved a lot compared to two years ago.

1001
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,640
He has become more earnest and humble,

1002
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,280
and has the resoluteness

1003
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,800
of a military man.

1004
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:04,160
He is really a good husband.

1005
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:06,360
Is Father choosing a son-in-law

1006
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,880
or a disciple?

1007
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,120
Let's not talk about Father then.

1008
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,640
Let's talk about Second Brother.

1009
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,960
if he's of bad character,

1010
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,200
why would Second Brother be friends

1011
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,720
with him for so many years?

1012
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,240
Now he has even achieved merits,

1013
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,200
pacified unrest and set out on western expeditions.

1014
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,120
How many men in this world

1015
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,320
are as capable as he is?

1016
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:24,880
But that

1017
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,880
womanizing past of his

1018
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,196
is higher than the mountains

1019
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:29,720
Didn't he already drive out

1020
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,400
that outside mistress of his?

1021
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,000
When I was little,

1022
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,700
when my mother had a difficult labor

1023
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,840
and was on the brink of death,

1024
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:38,880
it was he who helped me find a doctor.

1025
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:41,440
And every time I have encountered danger,

1026
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,800
it was he who saved me.

1027
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,730
But those times he helped you, you really--

1028
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:49,820
Since he has changed

1029
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:50,680
and has never

1030
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,080
taken in any concubine,

1031
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:54,440
I think he also won't do an act of

1032
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,880
spoiling his concubine and neglecting his wife.

1033
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,120
Just be at ease in stably

1034
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,880
having your Big Madam role.

1035
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,160
What else are you afraid of?

1036
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,560
You are praising him like some flower.

1037
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,280
If you feel that he's that good,

1038
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,480
then you go marry him!

1039
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,040
But he doesn't want me!

1040
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,400
The person he wants is you.

1041
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:14,680
But I don't want him.

1042
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,520
I want Brother Jing.
