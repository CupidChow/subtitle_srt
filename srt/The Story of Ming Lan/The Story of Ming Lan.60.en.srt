00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Ming Lan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,725
Episode 60

3
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,800
Your daughter-in-law tried to persuade in all ways.

4
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,400
But my sister is just so obsessed with it.

5
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,840
She doesn't listen to me despite how I persuade.

6
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,760
Forget it.

7
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,800
I didn't expect you

8
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,160
to put this in mind.

9
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,080
So forget it.

10
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,600
You stay out of this matter then.

11
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,680
I will surely in the future . . .

12
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,080
Minglan isn't born by you.

13
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,520
You don't take her to heart seriously

14
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,880
and I can't force you.

15
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,360
A woman being mindful

16
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,800
of her maiden home is reasonable.

17
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,920
so I can let that go.

18
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,360
But you

19
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,600
show your favoritism too obviously.

20
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,920
You even lavish affection on Kang House.

21
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,520
How could I?

22
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,600
Stand up.

23
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,920
Stand over there.

24
00:02:21,334 --> 00:02:22,680
I won't explain

25
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,000
other principles,

26
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,760
since you won't understand anyway.

27
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,440
I've said to you over and over already.

28
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,280
Don't have connection with Kang House.

29
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,025
And disallow her to

30
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:31,640
come to our home.

31
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,000
But you let her come without my knowledge.

32
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,080
You defy your elder like this.

33
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,680
You ignored me.

34
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,680
Kneel.

35
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,720
What?

36
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,520
Kneel here?

37
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,200
Kneel.

38
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,000
Back when Lin was still around,

39
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,280
you were indeed suffering wrongly.

40
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,320
So no matter what offense you commit,

41
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,960
I would only say a few words

42
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,440
but never punish you seriously.

43
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,320
But now I see that

44
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,280
I spoiled you too much.

45
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,560
You kneel here for a day.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,120
If she dares to come again,

47
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,320
you go and kneel in the yard.

48
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,880
Mother. Mother.

49
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,680
I accept the punishment.

50
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,120
But isn't it too harsh?

51
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,960
I am the main wife in charge of the house!

52
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,640
If you don't accept,

53
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,280
go to your husband.

54
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,050
If you still don't accept,

55
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,360
go back to your maiden home.

56
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,840
Big Madam.

57
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,720
Get lost!

58
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,760
Don't think I don't know

59
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,720
you're laughing at me.

60
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,240
Get lost!

61
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,480
They really just

62
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,400
sent her away?

63
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,360
They just sent her out.

64
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,240
Our people followed and saw Sheng House

65
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,160
send the woman out of the city

66
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,840
in a carriage in the rain.

67
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,560
Neither did they wait for

68
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,640
a clear weather nor the daylight.

69
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,840
Sheng House's brat.

70
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,760
She looks so petite and delicate.

71
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,680
An illegitimate born.

72
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,360
But she's actually an opponent.

73
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,360
Yes.

74
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,120
She suddenly makes this act

75
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,400
of pulling the carpet under us.

76
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,120
Even if we expose her,

77
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,200
but Kang Zhao'er

78
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,440
has already been sent away.

79
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,280
The one from Kang House

80
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,240
is an useless thing.

81
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,440
Wasting my words.

82
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,360
Other than having a loud voice,

83
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,080
she's trash.

84
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,200
I never thought that

85
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,160
Madam Sheng is so young,

86
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,250
but she makes her moves

87
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,200
with so much weight and astuteness.

88
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,600
Doesn't have any loophole

89
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,120
and deceives all of us

90
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,000
completely.

91
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,280
Big Madam.

92
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:11,840
I think

93
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,720
this brat isn't an easy opponent.

94
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,120
Maybe we should just quit.

95
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,520
There are only two paths.

96
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,240
Either I let Second

97
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,160
boil me with fire.

98
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,120
Or I choose a way to death on my own.

99
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,960
Big Madam.

100
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,280
I have a Buddhist figure in my room.

101
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,280
The Maitreya.

102
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,920
It was actually begged

103
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,840
from a high monk

104
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,840
by the old marquis.

105
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,960
He prays to this figure in the room every day.

106
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,280
Do you know

107
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,720
what he prays for?

108
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,600
It must be for the family's rise of glory.

109
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,440
You're wrong.

110
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,240
Maitreya is the future bodhisattva.

111
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,400
He was praying

112
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,080
that he meet my big sister again

113
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,640
in the next life.

114
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,000
That . . . isn't for sure.

115
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,480
Actually the old marquis

116
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,560
knew very clearly.

117
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,480
Big Sister wasn't actually a great mate.

118
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,440
She wasn't gifted for birth and child-rearing.

119
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,120
She wasn't gifted in managing house.

120
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,080
And her life wouldn't be long.

121
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,160
But he just loved her.

122
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:13,711
No matter how great and virtuous others were,

123
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,960
That's all useless.

124
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,640
That's all in the past.

125
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,160
Old Marquis

126
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,240
doted on you too.

127
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,560
Old Marquis

128
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,520
really loved Big Sister.

129
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,960
After Big Sister died,

130
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,560
he

131
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,600
just became

132
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,240
an empty shell in this house,

133
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,320
wandering around.

134
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,840
These days,

135
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,280
the passion of Second and his bride

136
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,560
that I see

137
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,200
is exactly the same as his old man.

138
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,840
Both are born as pig heads.

139
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,880
If this Sheng Minglan dies,

140
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,880
Second will be crippled.

141
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,200
It's true.

142
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,520
He would be crippled for real.

143
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,920
So this time,

144
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,560
I don't want anything else.

145
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,640
I only want Sheng Minglan's life!

146
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,960
Big Madam!

147
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,000
This is the shrine,

148
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,720
and you can't say that.

149
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,760
Am I supposed to be scared

150
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,168
of these useless wood?

151
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,560
Big Madam.

152
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,880
Big Madam.

153
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,000
Best to be careful.

154
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,600
If you really did that,

155
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,000
there's no way

156
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,080
to retreat unharmed.

157
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,000
How about we just keep waiting.

158
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,920
And she might

159
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,400
meet with some mishap on her own.

160
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,360
Wait?

161
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,520
When will I ever get

162
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,760
this great opportunity again?

163
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,600
So many are trying to kill

164
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,640
Second in the south.

165
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,960
He thought he was

166
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,960
so thorough in self-defense.

167
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,600
But as long as those around him

168
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,840
show

169
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,680
just a slight crevice,

170
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,600
just you watch,

171
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,400
in whose hands he will die!

172
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,360
Even if he doesn't die on the road,

173
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,600
well,

174
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,880
He can come back.

175
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,440
Come back

176
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,440
and he will only see Sheng Minglan's corpse!

177
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,640
Big Madam.

178
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,320
At that time,

179
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,280
Gu Tingye's heart will be completely broken.

180
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,840
Then he can just marry some useless chit.

181
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:42,240
And she won't be as difficult

182
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,560
to deal with as Sheng Minglan.

183
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:45,960
Even if

184
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,200
he garners another legitimate heir.

185
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,840
Who can know

186
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,320
when that will be!

187
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,800
This husband who longs for his deceased wife.

188
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,040
A step wife who can never

189
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,520
grasp her husband's heart.

190
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,000
And that can never be

191
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,440
a harmonious family!

192
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,480
At that time,

193
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,120
we just stir up the muddy water for fish.

194
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,480
And that will be much easier than now.

195
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,505
Even if...

196
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,160
Even if Sheng Minglan's

197
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,120
child in her womb . . .

198
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,240
If that child doesn't die,

199
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,680
then he will be stuck with a stepmother.

200
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,280
And that's a great show to watch as well.

201
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,080
At that time, this house.

202
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,560
This family!

203
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,880
This family will be so bustling.

204
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,400
Second's bride.

205
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,240
How is she now?

206
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,480
How's her complexion?

207
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,000
Though the matter is finished,

208
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,600
according to Fengxian,

209
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,080
when she went to pay her respect,

210
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,320
her complexion

211
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,240
wasn't refreshed.

212
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,160
Great.

213
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,080
Fengxian also said

214
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,680
she's not eating much lately.

215
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,560
Great!

216
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,400
Saying she's queasy.

217
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,840
And earlier she was queasy too.

218
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,000
But she ate more than now

219
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,200
so it must be the stress of things.

220
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,960
Great!

221
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,280
More troubles and less eating.

222
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,760
Neither is a sign of longevity.

223
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,280
Ji'an.

224
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,320
I'm old.

225
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,520
But this pair of husband and wife,

226
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,560
they are in their prime.

227
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,800
If I really

228
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,280
just take in my last breath,

229
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,440
I...

230
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,160
I can't be content!

231
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,640
Alright. Alright.

232
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,600
Alright.

233
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,440
Big Miss,

234
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,080
please talk to her.

235
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,480
Big Madam

236
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,800
lost face really harshly.

237
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,960
Get lost!

238
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,920
You just want me to die!

239
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,120
You all get lost!

240
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:37,920
Mother.

241
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,440
You heartless deadbeat brat!

242
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,560
Where have you been?

243
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,240
Mother.

244
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,640
You...

245
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,440
your mother's about to be forced dead.

246
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,600
And you still didn't come,

247
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,720
you would be cleaning up my bones.

248
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,560
Mother.

249
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,520
Mother.

250
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,920
Mother.

251
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,640
Mother, stop crying.

252
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,960
Others will laugh at you,

253
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,000
and you'd lose face.

254
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,840
Face?

255
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,880
What face?

256
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,720
I've married into the Sheng House for decades.

257
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,240
I've endured until today.

258
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,680
And I have you three siblings.

259
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,520
One's an official

260
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,360
and the others are married.

261
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,880
Now I'm all alone in this inner courtyard.

262
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,240
And I get to be wasted by others to their like.

263
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,600
Your aunt's full of big ideas

264
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,760
and I can't persuade her

265
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,960
so what else can I do?

266
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,520
I can't live.

267
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,880
Mother.

268
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,280
Grandmother isn't blaming you

269
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,400
for not being able to persuade aunt.

270
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,920
She blames you

271
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,200
for not recognizing right and wrong, good and bad.

272
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,880
Think.

273
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,920
The way Aunt used to scold

274
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,040
and berate Minglan.

275
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,920
Why should Minglan respect and honor her?

276
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,120
Even you think of her

277
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,175
and don't go to Gu House

278
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,280
to ask for favor.

279
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,200
You didn't want to trouble her

280
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,520
and have her belittled by her husband's family.

281
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,600
But here comes Aunt.

282
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,720
Going there with full fanfare

283
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,600
to put up air and wield authority.

284
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,040
That's the fox exploiting the tiger's might.

285
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,840
Using our Sheng honor

286
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,600
to add superiority for Kang House.

287
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,880
What do you know?

288
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,640
That Ming brat isn't blood-related to me.

289
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,080
She reached high

290
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,400
and isn't obedient anymore.

291
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,800
That Zhao'er

292
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,240
is much more docile than Ming brat.

293
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,640
She will be easy to use later on.

294
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,400
You're muddled.

295
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,120
You speak like a child.

296
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,760
Minglan isn't

297
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,880
a blood relation to you.

298
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,120
But no matter what,

299
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,160
she's a biological sister

300
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,360
to us siblings.

301
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,320
If something happens,

302
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,240
on the account of the Sheng House,

303
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,080
on the account of the old madam,

304
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,560
Minglan would help us.

305
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,320
Kang Zhao'er

306
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,120
can't be closer to us

307
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,240
than Minglan.

308
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,320
Your aunt isn't without fault.

309
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,200
But what do you guys know?

310
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,480
Since your younger brother became an official.

311
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,440
He is just getting busier

312
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,880
and busier and now he's out.

313
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,000
You and Ru'er have

314
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,240
your own families to take care of.

315
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,840
With your father and your grandmother,

316
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,200
I have never been on the same page.

317
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,120
In this grand courtyard,

318
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,320
everyone finds me a pest.

319
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,520
Except for your aunt

320
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,000
who is willing to hear me out.

321
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,360
And she and I can converse easily.

322
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,680
Other than her,

323
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,040
who is willing to pay attention to me?

324
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,200
But it's alright.

325
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,440
In a couple of months,

326
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,400
my Wang House is coming.

327
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,240
My mother.

328
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,080
My older brother. They're all coming.

329
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,760
In this capital city,

330
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,040
I will have a backer too.

331
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,760
Old Sister,

332
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,200
we haven't seen each other in years!

333
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,680
Let's have a family meal together.

334
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,040
Come on.

335
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,760
Come.

336
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,320
Come.

337
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,560
Come.

338
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,120
Mother-in-law,

339
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,240
big brother-in-law isn't here.

340
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,200
It'll take a few more days.

341
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,280
The matters in hand

342
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,920
must be taken care of thoroughly

343
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,880
before he leaves that job.

344
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,720
You are the best child.

345
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,400
And you've been promoted lately?

346
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,050
It's all thanks to

347
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,200
your high regard of me back then

348
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,320
and your willingness to consent

349
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,640
the marriage that I have today.

350
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,040
He kept saying once you come,

351
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,480
and once my big brother comes,

352
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,080
we have to welcome you well.

353
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,440
What welcome or not?

354
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,320
Seeing all you children,

355
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,560
like I had taken the divine pill.

356
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,600
Come, come.

357
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,760
Everyone's here today.

358
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,200
But I don't see Sixth Miss

359
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,080
with the girl from your home.

360
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,400
There's an extra seat outside

361
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,240
for the children's table.

362
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,480
Isn't her child in her womb?

363
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,600
And it's here too.

364
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,320
Mother.

365
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,080
The fifth girl in my house.

366
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,350
She's gone to the old homestead

367
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,600
with her husband to pay tribute to ancestor today

368
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,440
so she can't make it here.

369
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,040
She said she wants you to

370
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,120
keep some sesame cakes

371
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,200
she loves for her.

372
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,200
Alright, alright.

373
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,160
We'll keep it for her.

374
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,880
I mean the illegitimate daughter

375
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,240
from outside.

376
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,480
Her name is Rong'er or Feng'er, right?

377
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,040
You ought to be good to her

378
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,920
and bring her

379
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,880
to see this kind of sight.

380
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,240
Then people can praise you

381
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,920
as a virtuous main mother.

382
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,040
Mother-in-law,

383
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,560
that child's got a bit of a chill.

384
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,480
So we won't have her come

385
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,760
and risk spreading the illness.

386
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,600
The child is more urgent.

387
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,120
She needs to have a rest.

388
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,320
Yes.

389
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,960
Girls are not like

390
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,880
boisterous boys.

391
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,400
Their bodies are more delicate.

392
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,320
How precious is she?

393
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,160
Who isn't precious?

394
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,240
I think you just . . .

395
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,440
Which family's child isn't precious?

396
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,560
A girl of 9 or 10 years of age

397
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,480
is so delicate.

398
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,560
You don't even understand that?

399
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,720
Hurry and eat.

400
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Taste this.

401
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,880
Come.

402
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,640
Come.

403
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:02,840
Mother-in-law,

404
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,120
allow me to toast to you.

405
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,040
Come.

406
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,080
General of Weibei's manor has someone here.

407
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,760
The servant said Madam Zhang is in difficult labor

408
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,840
and wants to see me.

409
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,400
Dear Buddha.

410
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,600
You are close friend of hers

411
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,640
so you'd better go and see.

412
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,680
This is the lady's trip to hell's gate.

413
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,160
Ming'er.

414
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,280
You have to watch your own body.

415
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,600
Yes.

416
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,560
Come, come. Eat.

417
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,400
Mother-in-law.

418
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,200
My good son-in-law.

419
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,360
This Old Wang Madam.

420
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,960
She's lived far out for years

421
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,880
and she knows

422
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,680
my Rong'er's age.

423
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,560
She also knows

424
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,320
I'm good friends with Sister Zhang.

425
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,080
She's so up to date in news.

426
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,720
Who knows what

427
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,960
that Madam Kang says behind you.

428
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,600
I think you feel

429
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,360
much better now.

430
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,240
Don't rush to tend to those official documents.

431
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,080
Recuperate first.

432
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,680
I told your maternal grandmother already.

433
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,720
After you're done filing this post,

434
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,950
we'll have your maternal uncle

435
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,240
find a post for you outside the capital.

436
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,560
Mother.

437
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,280
Stop asking uncle for favors.

438
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,520
Sister sent me a letter not long ago

439
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,920
saying aunt-in-law's mother-in-law's very strict.

440
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:35,800
If you go to ask uncle

441
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,920
for favors again,

442
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,360
it will be hard for him.

443
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,600
Forget it.

444
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,720
You don't need to worry about it.

445
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,400
As long as your maternal grandmother is alive,

446
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,400
this Wang House isn't

447
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,360
your aunt-in-law's turn to be in charge.

448
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,000
Mother,

449
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,000
you can't ask for favors forever.

450
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,760
Also,

451
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,840
I will work hard myself

452
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,800
and I can achieve it by myself.

453
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,560
I already made the arrangements

454
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,240
for you.

455
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,920
Father.

456
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,440
I will talk to you mother

457
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,200
so you go first.

458
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,560
Yes.

459
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,800
What a rare guest.

460
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,440
You've dealt with the outside.

461
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,040
And you can actually

462
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,200
think of coming here?

463
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,480
I suppose you saw my mother,

464
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,000
and you found out my brother was coming to the capital too.

465
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,680
And so you're putting some hope in our Wang House?

466
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,360
Everyone in the family

467
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,320
knows that you have sold my daughter.

468
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,640
Except for me!

469
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,760
I found a great future

470
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,200
like Gu House for Zhao'er.

471
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,040
Isn't that for

472
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,280
our Kang House's sake too?

473
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,760
You belittled

474
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,480
Sheng House before,

475
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,280
saying my sister's husband curries favor

476
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,960
and loses the honor of scholars.

477
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,720
Now we're currying favor too.

478
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,560
What a fart!

479
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,350
Brother Sheng just got promoted

480
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,280
to fourth rank.

481
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,240
And a few days later,

482
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,000
he's gone to the grain route.

483
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,120
Do you know what grain route is?

484
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,920
It's a fatty job. An important job!

485
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,040
Now his son-in-law's prestigious

486
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,080
and his son is successful.

487
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,120
The whole house is favored.

488
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,880
How are they willing to

489
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,600
share a cup of stew with others?

490
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,840
And you've thought of sending a daughter

491
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,160
to snatch his daughter's position?

492
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,500
What you did was trying to steal a chicken

493
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,360
only to end up losing the rice.

494
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,440
You didn't get to eat any goat meat

495
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,760
but got yourself covered in goat stench!

496
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,200
Since I've offended them already,

497
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,120
then we can't quit.

498
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,160
Let's finish the matter.

499
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,840
Before this,

500
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,360
we and Gu House

501
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,760
were distant relatives.

502
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,240
And I have to be watchful of my sister

503
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,440
and brother-in-law's moods.

504
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,680
But now,

505
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,400
if Gu House accepts Zhao'er.

506
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,880
Yes.

507
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,920
The reputation won't be so nice

508
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,720
but we got

509
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,760
the real stuff.

510
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,080
So we can have a connection with Gu House

511
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,000
directly in the future.

512
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,240
You thought it was going to succeed?

513
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,440
Zhao'er been sent to Youyang already!

514
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:15,960
What?

515
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,320
What did you say?

516
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:19,640
Brother Sheng took me

517
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,360
to the side earlier.

518
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,680
He said

519
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,625
he couldn't bear to watch

520
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:24,280
my daughter become a concubine.

521
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,440
So they will find

522
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,680
a good match for her in Youyang.

523
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,800
And he said,

524
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:30,975
not to be so harsh

525
00:25:30,975 --> 00:25:32,080
with Zhao'er real mother anymore.

526
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,025
Saying it should be considered

527
00:25:33,025 --> 00:25:33,880
building up merit with good deeds.

528
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,600
Upon hearing that,

529
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,560
I had no place

530
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,440
to put my face from that shame.

531
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,200
I...

532
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,520
if it hadn't been

533
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,840
your devotion to my father's mourning of three years,

534
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:47,800
I

535
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,200
I would give you the repudiating papers now.

536
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:51,920
Repudiate me?

537
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,400
Go ahead and do it now if you dare.

538
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,720
You think I am afraid to repudiate you?

539
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:00,720
I think you can't spare the assistance

540
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,000
from my Wang House!

541
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,520
You thought I was willing to

542
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,840
live this Kang life?

543
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,600
You keep getting a concubine incessantly.

544
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,120
And if you could spare me

545
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,640
from worrying about your son's future

546
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,920
and the money at home.

547
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,720
I wouldn't make a sound

548
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,960
even if you got yourself a few hundred women.

549
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,000
But you're just a tough mouth outside.

550
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,920
And hallow inside.

551
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,640
Today, I have to beg my brother.

552
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,720
Tomorrow, I have to ask my brother-in-law for help.

553
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,440
I have to fill the coffer deficit

554
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,533
with my dowry.

555
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,520
Kang Haifeng.

556
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,680
You little loser

557
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,080
of a cuckold.

558
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,520
How was I so blind back then

559
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,600
to pick you to marry?

560
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,560
I . . .

561
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,160
If you dare to yak more

562
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,440
I will report you as having gone mad.

563
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,240
And I will nail shut your room and lock you in.

564
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,280
You...

565
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,400
I...

566
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,400
I will never let those guys off.

567
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,040
You just watch.

568
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,480
How is it?

569
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,480
It's not good.

570
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,120
My madam said this.

571
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,720
She can be assured

572
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,520
only if Sheng Madam is here.

573
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,040
So we had to invite you suddenly.

574
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:27,800
Last time I came,

575
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,960
the doctor said

576
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,080
you still have another ten days or more to go.

577
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,200
How is she suddenly

578
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,400
This morning that whore Little Zou

579
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,440
insisted on

580
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,080
curtsy.

581
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,040
My miss said

582
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,720
she didn't want to see her.

583
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,440
But she said

584
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,440
before the general left for camp patrol,

585
00:27:38,547 --> 00:27:39,680
he told her

586
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,280
she had to come.

587
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,480
So the two sides pulled and pushed

588
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,320
and she knocked into my miss.

589
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,440
Mother Fan, don't fret.

590
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,520
The more

591
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,366
the situation like this,

592
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,280
the more you have to be calm.

593
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,280
Or if we get ourselves fretting in ruckus,

594
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,400
who will your big madam depend on?

595
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,360
Yes.

596
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,640
Is the midwife here? And the doctor?

597
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,960
We found two midwives in a rush.

598
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,320
And we invited the doctor from the imperial palace

599
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,680
who specializes in women care, Doctor Zhao.

600
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,760
Great.

601
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,160
Careful.

602
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,320
Bear it.

603
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,840
How is she?

604
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,160
You

605
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,200
You hold on for me.

606
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,360
Don't call my parents.

607
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,400
They had me at old age

608
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,640
and they are elderly now.

609
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,400
They can't bear it.

610
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,640
But by myself

611
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,440
myself

612
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,960
I can't bear it either.

613
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,000
We need your father

614
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,880
and mother to come.

615
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,320
If they come and see me like this,

616
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,720
they will only be heart-broken.

617
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,760
You...

618
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,000
you...

619
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,320
You're muddled.

620
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,320
Half a life.

621
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,120
You're halfway in the hell's gate

622
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,240
so why do you think of that?

623
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,880
You bear it through for me.

624
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,480
Don't be scared.

625
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,280
Everyone who delivers a baby needs to do this.

626
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,960
I will hold things up for you outside

627
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,320
and you listen to the midwife.

628
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,320
Big Madam,

629
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,360
Big Madam, continue to bear it.

630
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:13,920
continue to bear it.

631
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,720
It's not lowered yet.

632
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,480
Yes, bear it more.

633
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,120
Is the midwife reliable?

634
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,120
They are all seasoned help for the duchess.

635
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,000
Their maiden home

636
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,080
or children's contracts

637
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,000
are all

638
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,600
in the ducal house.

639
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,560
Where is the Duke of the State?

640
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,960
Duke of the State is at camp patrol.

641
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,840
Hurry up and send someone to invite

642
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,992
both the Duke and the Duchess back.

643
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,480
But our miss

644
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,720
said no.

645
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,880
I said to invite them earlier

646
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:44,800
and she threw

647
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,560
a huge temper.

648
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,520
It's alright.

649
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:47,960
After she give birth to the child,

650
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:48,840
she can vent her anger at me.

651
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,840
You just send someone to go now.

652
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,360
Yes.

653
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,360
I was told the general was at camp patrol.

654
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,880
Is he with the duke?

655
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,560
Is he on official duty

656
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,520
or personal patrol?

657
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,560
General left

658
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,480
from our yard this morning.

659
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,960
He said he was afraid the subordinates

660
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,600
will languish so he had to go and see.

661
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,800
I didn't hear him say it was an official matter

662
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,360
or that he was with the duke of the state.

663
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,000
Since it's not an official matter,

664
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,880
invite the general back too.

665
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,760
On fast horse.

666
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,440
Hurry.

667
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,480
Hurry, hurry.

668
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,280
Go to invite the general.

669
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,040
Tell the doctor to come and talk to me.

670
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,480
Imperial Doctor Zhao

671
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,800
has been detained

672
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,520
by Concubine Zou's men.

673
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,680
What?

674
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,760
Detained?

675
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,600
Earlier the doctor went out to the lavatory

676
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,720
and on the way back,

677
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,040
he ran into Concubine Zou

678
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,720
and she asked him to have her pulse checked.

679
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,560
But who knew that

680
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,920
Concubine Zou's older brother

681
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,320
and wife were there too.

682
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,080
They heard the imperial doctor came from the palace.

683
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,040
So they forced him to go to their room.

684
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,640
Lancao is still waiting there.

685
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,080
Those wretched turds.

686
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,280
Summon the male servant to invite him back.

687
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:44,920
Yes.

688
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:45,880
Hurry.

689
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,520
Big Madam has given birth to a few before.

690
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,480
So you have some experience?

691
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,480
I've never been in labor.

692
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,160
But I've seen someone

693
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,080
lose her life in labor.

694
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,040
You all hear me.

695
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,280
You must secure Big Madam Zhang's life.

696
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,760
Big Madam Zhang's suffered a knock into her

697
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,640
and the child has gone horizontal.

698
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,440
I understand.

699
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,640
This matter is very hard?

700
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,640
If the doctor can put in needles,

701
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,520
it may be improved.

702
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,200
I know some doctors

703
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,320
have the special skill.

704
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:21,925
And they can bring back

705
00:31:21,925 --> 00:31:22,840
a fainted woman in labor

706
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,200
with just a needle of acupuncture.

707
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,000
And some are even more skilled.

708
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,680
With just one needle,

709
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,200
they can secure the position of the fetus.

710
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,040
Good.

711
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,240
I will find the doctor.

712
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,400
Mother Hu,

713
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,560
you ladies take care of her.

714
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,160
If we can pass this,

715
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,160
the duke and the duchess of state,

716
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,000
the entire house of imperial uncle

717
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,960
will be grateful to you.

718
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,640
You ladies focus on the work

719
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,640
without worry of others.

720
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,480
We will surely look after her well.

721
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,440
What? Where's Doctor Zhao?

722
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,920
I went to Concubine Zou's

723
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,880
with two male servants.

724
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:01,760
We told her we're waiting

725
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,720
to the birth of the baby here

726
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,120
and asked them to bring the doctor out.

727
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,080
But who knew,

728
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,600
that Uncle Zou

729
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,520
slapped me.

730
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,920
He said he's not seen any imperial doctors.

731
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,840
I told Xiaoli and Xiaomu to go in

732
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:12,920
and find him but they out-numbered and out-powered us.

733
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,040
They kept those two confined

734
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,160
and beat them.

735
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,040
Did you see Imperial Doctor Zhao?

736
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,160
No.

737
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,320
I never even saw him.

738
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,600
I don't know if

739
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,520
he's really left their yard.

740
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,240
He was invited here

741
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,520
to help your big madam

742
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,240
in labor.

743
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:27,200
If he's left,

744
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,000
he would be coming this way.

745
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:30,080
You personally saw them

746
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,320
take Doctor Zhao away?

747
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,120
Yes.

748
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,120
I saw it.

749
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,440
Even if I have to testify at Keifeng Precicnt,

750
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,400
I will still say like this.

751
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,040
Does the national law work?

752
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,880
Our miss is a noble lady,

753
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,720
the legitimate main wife.

754
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,600
But she's having to endure

755
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,080
such sinister and filthy wrong?

756
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,560
Big Madam.

757
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,640
Big Madam.

758
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,840
Big Madam, just ahead.

759
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,200
Turn right at the next corner and we're there.

760
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,600
just next corner?

761
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,800
Royal Physician Zhao!

762
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,840
Royal Physician Zhao!

763
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,920
Why are you shouting?

764
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,520
What is a woman like you doing?

765
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,520
Royal Physician Zhao has long gone.

766
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,520
Indeed.

767
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,760
After Royal Physician Zhao checked my pulses,

768
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,840
we then sent him away

769
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,640
in a proper manner.

770
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,840
Search the courtyard!

771
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:44,760
Where do you think you are?!

772
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,440
Stop!

773
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,640
Stop them!

774
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,840
How dare you!

775
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,480
Search!

776
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,240
Get lost!

777
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,640
You dare to search

778
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,440
the general manor?!

779
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,080
You don't want to live anymore,

780
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:53,960
is that so?!

781
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,600
Don't move!

782
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,320
Sister-in-law...

783
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,040
Royal Physician Zhao!

784
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,000
Stop him!

785
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,120
Where's Royal Physician Zhao?

786
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,240
Big Madam,

787
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,000
they brought Royal Physician Zhao

788
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,000
to the back courtyard to drink tea.

789
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,040
When I arrived,

790
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,680
royal physician is so anxious.

791
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:13,711
Is Big Madam in labor?
royal physician is so anxious.

792
00:34:13,711 --> 00:34:15,000
Is Big Madam in labor?

793
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,040
Yes.

794
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:16,960
Royal Physician,

795
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,160
let's not waste time. Walk and talk.

796
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:18,920
Okay. Okay.

797
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,320
Who do you think you are?

798
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,225
You dare to drag people

799
00:34:30,225 --> 00:34:31,160
from my sister's courtyard?

800
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,640
I'm gravely ill

801
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,000
and you dare to drag away the doctor?

802
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,360
Do you want to kill me?

803
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,400
You...are you alright?

804
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,400
I've seen this trick

805
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,040
when I was still a child,

806
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,080
but I'm not a child anymore!

807
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,880
How come Big Madam Zhang

808
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,800
isn't making any sound?

809
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,920
This is a job that requires a lot of strength.

810
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,320
If you put all your strength in shouting,

811
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:04,760
you won't have any energy

812
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,760
to give birth to the child later.

813
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,160
Who do you think your family is?!

814
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,200
Big Madam, you know so much.

815
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,080
Tell me. Tell me.

816
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,720
Yes. Yes.

817
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,960
Calm down first.

818
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,560
My daughter has such a hard fate.

819
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,720
I got this daughter

820
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,160
when I was already quite old.

821
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,640
She's a blessing from the deities above.

822
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,040
How may people laughed at me

823
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,240
for being an old clam bearing a pearl?

824
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,800
I wasn't afraid of their laughs.

825
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,000
I just want this daughter.

826
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,200
You think my daughter

827
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,600
was stuffed into your house?

828
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,440
You think my daughter

829
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,480
can't be married off,

830
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,760
that she must make a connection with your family, is that it?

831
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,440
Later, she might be escalating her lecture

832
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,520
to Her Highness Empress.

833
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,960
Let's bring these tea and fruits

834
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,280
to deliver to Duchess of State

835
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,720
to interrupt them

836
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,080
and save General Shen.

837
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,800
Duchess and General, are you hungry?

838
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,640
Forgive me for being rude.

839
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,600
It's about to be midnight soon.

840
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,500
I asked someone to prepare me some fruits.

841
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:03,920
Taste them.

842
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,560
Fill your stomach with these first.

843
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,640
It will take a long time to deliver a child.

844
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,760
Good child.

845
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,000
What Duchess?

846
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,720
Just call me auntie.

847
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,400
You even are pregnant,

848
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,200
yet you did all of that for my daughter.

849
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,120
Child,

850
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,200
I'll remember you.

851
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,720
My daughter really has a hard life.

852
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,160
She's now even struggling

853
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,560
at the palace of the God of Hell.

854
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,120
I really don't know

855
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,920
what sin have I committed!

856
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,720
You... I...

857
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,960
If anything bad

858
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,320
happens to my daughter, you...

859
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,000
Auntie. Auntie.

860
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,000
Calm down a little.

861
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,360
Calm down.

862
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,960
Sister is now inside giving a birth.

863
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,080
This house is depending on you.

864
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,320
You mustn't be panic.

865
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,560
Oh, no! Oh, no,

866
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,480
Madam! Miss...

867
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,760
Miss is...

868
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,320
Miss is dying...

869
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,600
My daughter!

870
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,680
What's going on?

871
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,520
How is that possible?

872
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,320
Daughter! Daughter!

873
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,040
Mother!

874
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,640
Here! Here!

875
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,360
Mother!

876
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,560
Mother is here!

877
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,320
Monther.

878
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,640
Child, hold on.

879
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,640
Your father will be here soon.

880
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,960
Endure it, my child!

881
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,760
More strength, more strength.

882
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,760
More strength.

883
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,800
A little bit more strength.

884
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,600
My child...

885
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,520
Push!

886
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,040
Look! She's hemorrhaging!

887
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,040
Hurry. Hurry.

888
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,280
General, get more cloth!

889
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,345
Father! Mother!

890
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,760
I'm doing my filial duties one last time!

891
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,160
My wife!

892
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,600
She's given birth! She's given birth!

893
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,520
The child is out!

894
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,040
The child is out!

895
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,240
Kick Little Lady Zhou out of your house.

896
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:53,920
She...

897
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,440
She committed a grave mistake.

898
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,680
I surely will cruelly punish her.

899
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,600
But I beg father-in-law...

900
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,640
I really can't do it for her older sister's sake.

901
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,450
Pitying one's servant

902
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:08,960
because of considering past affection.

903
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,120
Also giving out one's wealth because of a dream.

904
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,100
Remembering one's wife shows

905
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,600
how deep your love and loyalty is.

906
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,640
I'm a man, so I understand.

907
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,360
Since that's the case,

908
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,200
State Uncle, just write us a separation letter.

909
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,733
Our two houses will divide

910
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,920
and just strive for each future separately.

911
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,160
You...

912
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,080
What are you saying?

913
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,360
I've told you that

914
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,320
my daughter didn't beg you

915
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,840
to marry her.

916
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,760
It's also not as if she can't be married off that

917
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,160
we must stuff her into your house.

918
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,400
It's good that you didn't forget

919
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,640
your past wife.

920
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,960
But keeping a snake in your house who will create future trouble

921
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,680
is deliberately wanting

922
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,080
the life of my daughter.

923
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,800
Today, she's able to preserve half of her life.

924
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,960
That is because she had the good fate

925
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,280
of meeting Marquess Gu.

926
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,280
If not,

927
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,600
the one we're seeing now

928
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,520
is her corpse.

929
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,240
State Uncle,

930
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,640
let our families just depart in an amicable manner.

931
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,120
After you write a separation letter,

932
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,080
we'll still be able to act in a civil manner

933
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,720
when we see each other here in the capital.

934
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,200
Or else, if we shed all pretenses

935
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,040
in front of the emperor,

936
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,000
we all be awkward.

937
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,280
No.

938
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,440
I won't separate.

939
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:21,960
I won't separate.

940
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,080
No...

941
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,840
You won't amicably separate?

942
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,080
Are you still planning to divorce her?!

943
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:29,960
No! No!

944
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,840
I'm not divorcing her.

945
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,800
From now on,

946
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,640
I surely will treat her well

947
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,400
and carefully cherish her.

948
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,160
I won't let anything bad

949
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,280
happen to her again.

950
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,280
Enough!

951
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,360
Saying all these now

952
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,000
is worth nothing anymore.

953
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:46,500
Nanny Fan!

954
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,240
Here!

955
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,200
Has the carriage been prepared?

956
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:50,760
Replying to Madam,

957
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,840
we're done customizing the carriage.

958
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,440
We've placed a thick layer of bedding inside.

959
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,280
We've also painted cow oil inside,

960
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,360
ensuring that no wind will get in.

961
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,320
Miss will surely

962
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,360
not suffer any cold.

963
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,160
Let's go.

964
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,360
Father-in-law!

965
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:08,880
Mother-in-law!

966
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,080
Good child,

967
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:10,920
thank you for today.

968
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,000
It's a bit chaotic right now.

969
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,760
We'll surely visit the marquis manor next time

970
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,080
to thank you for doing your best to help us.

971
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,240
You're welcome.

972
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,760
As long as sister will recuperate well,

973
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,120
no need to put

974
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,400
anything else to heart.

975
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,000
Father-in-law, let's discuss this further.

976
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,200
Don't let my wife get exposed to the cold wind.

977
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,040
The child hasn't been born that long yet.

978
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,040
Every step you stop me,

979
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,120
I would be walking a step slower.

980
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,320
Every time I slow down my step,

981
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,040
Fen'er will then suffer a step more of jolting

982
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:35,920
and pain.

983
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,720
If you still have a conscience,

984
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,000
then get lost.

985
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:46,960
Father-in-law!

986
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,280
Wife!

987
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,280
Since flooding has subsided

988
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,000
in the western main camp,

989
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,800
the personnel and horses there

990
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,520
should have been settled down by now.

991
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,760
A few days ago, subject Shen went to check on them.

992
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,440
Subject Shen.

993
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,120
Informing Your Majesty,

994
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,040
General Shen is absent today.

995
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,400
Duke Ying of the State went to the east

996
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,480
to organize the troops there.

997
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,480
What about the situation in the east?

998
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,480
Duke Ying of the State sent there letter

999
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,250
to ask for a leave of absence

1000
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:26,280
to the Ministry of Personnel last night.

1001
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,280
He's also absent today.

1002
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,440
What's going on?

1003
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,360
Your Majesty,

1004
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,375
Duke Ying of the State

1005
00:42:36,375 --> 00:42:37,250
has been organizing the troops

1006
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:38,600
in the eastern military camp for the past days.

1007
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,800
Last night, he suddenly rushed back

1008
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,280
with his horse into the capital

1009
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,880
and went to General Shen's house.

1010
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,880
Not long after he returned home,

1011
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,311
he suddenly fainted.

1012
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,040
They had to ask for a doctor overnight

1013
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,840
and he was eventually saved.

1014
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,360
The doctor said that

1015
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,975
it was because of getting exhausted

1016
00:42:54,975 --> 00:42:56,560
for several days and then hearing bad news,

1017
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,440
hence, his blood didn't circulate properly

1018
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,680
and harmed his insides.

1019
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,880
What bad news?

1020
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,120
General Shen's wife had a difficult labor

1021
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,600
and almost died,

1022
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,440
before she was able to give birth to a son.

1023
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,275
Old Duke of the State fetched

1024
00:43:09,275 --> 00:43:10,360
his daughter and grandson

1025
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,800
back to their home to be cared for.

1026
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,840
He said...

1027
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,000
What did he say?

1028
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,975
He said that he wants an amicable separation

1029
00:43:16,975 --> 00:43:17,600
with the Shen Family.
