00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Ming Lan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,580
Episode 61

3
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:04,675
Sir,

4
00:01:04,675 --> 00:01:05,920
stop slapping!

5
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,320
I beg you!

6
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,560
I admit my mistake!

7
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,000
Stop slapping!

8
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,480
I beg you!

9
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,440
Stop slapping!

10
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,240
I haven't seen someone

11
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,750
who dared to avoid the imperial decree

12
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,440
of the empress dowager.

13
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,100
General, save me!

14
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:23,920
General!

15
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,000
The soul of my older sister in heaven

16
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,360
would ache for me! Sir!

17
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,920
Please spare her.

18
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,000
It's the Empress Dowager's decree.

19
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,440
Little Lady Zou offended her superior,

20
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,120
tried to kill the main wife,

21
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,800
and caused the morality in this house to decay.

22
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,200
She had to be slapped in the face 50 times.

23
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,440
There are still 25 slaps left.

24
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,240
No, sir,

25
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,040
if you complete those 50 slaps,

26
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,520
her face would be destroyed.

27
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,240
I'm just doing my job.

28
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,440
Men!

29
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,040
Ask General to leave.

30
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,640
Sir, come with us.

31
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,040
Get lost!

32
00:02:10,825 --> 00:02:11,875
Huh?

33
00:02:15,075 --> 00:02:16,275
Who was that?

34
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,320
Sir,

35
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,400
it's all my fault.

36
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,320
Did I hurt you?

37
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,480
Servant! Servant!

38
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,840
Call the doctor!

39
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,480
I...

40
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,080
Sir!

41
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,000
I want to see Empress Dowager!

42
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,960
I want to see Empress Dowager!

43
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,600
The House of Shen acted as you predicted.

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,920
They became violent.

45
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,120
Were you hurt?

46
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,720
Thank you for your concerns.

47
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,680
I slipped and fell on my own.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I know my limits.

49
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,800
You old slick.

50
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,000
Yes.

51
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,640
Weibei General Shen Congxing

52
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,025
didn't cultivate good private morality

53
00:03:04,025 --> 00:03:05,560
and has a chaotic harem.

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,720
He hindered the execution of the law

55
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,200
and broke the law on family relationship.

56
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,050
He tarnishes the splendor

57
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:12,920
of your imperial crown.

58
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,080
He should be severely punished without pardon.

59
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,000
I was the matchmaker in this marriage.

60
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,120
Now, it has become my fault.

61
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,000
Your Majesty is the ruler of the empire.

62
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,920
If you want the Zhang Family

63
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,040
to spill their blood in the battlefield,

64
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,000
those men will not even knit an eyebrow.

65
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,080
those men will not even knit an eyebrow.

66
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,875
Whatever you desire,

67
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,925
wherever the blade of the sword of

68
00:03:42,925 --> 00:03:43,920
politics and military is pointing,

69
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,920
is a duty that all subjects should fulfill.

70
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,800
Moreover, this is just a measly marriage matter.

71
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,680
Your Majesty shouldn't be crying

72
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,080
or worrying for the women.

73
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,160
The Zhang Family

74
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,920
is indeed a family that has served three emperors.

75
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,520
No one can say such pressuring words

76
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,640
more suitable than

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,320
Duke Ying of the State, the Old General Zhang.

78
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,200
But aren't those words

79
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,280
expressing loyalty to the emperor?

80
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,075
You...

81
00:04:14,075 --> 00:04:15,000
too soft.

82
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,040
When I look at this child,

83
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,880
I feel at ease.

84
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,440
If you were not in the Shen Manor

85
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,440
supporting me that day,

86
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,800
I fear that I wouldn't

87
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,840
be able to see the sun today.

88
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,680
In the future,

89
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
he must call you godmother.

90
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,680
No matter what happens,

91
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,760
I will ensure you

92
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,720
and your child's safety.

93
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,160
I heard that day,

94
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,800
you used a sword.

95
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,600
That day, when I arrived in the general manor

96
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,400
and saw that there was no one by your bedside,

97
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,720
I panicked.

98
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,480
I was thinking that

99
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,600
even if I get struck by lightning,

100
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,560
I must get the doctor back.

101
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,700
Fine, fine.

102
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,320
It's all my fault.

103
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,400
Let's stop talking about it.

104
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,680
You still have one in your womb.

105
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,480
You must be careful.

106
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,680
Our whole family

107
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,600
is grateful for your help.

108
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,480
What about the Shen Family?

109
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,880
The Shen Family has always had a good relationship

110
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,040
with your marquis husband.

111
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,920
They surely will be grateful to you.

112
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,520
I'm not talking about that.

113
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,440
I'm saying...

114
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,040
Did General...

115
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,960
He comes everyday.

116
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,360
It's just that I don't want to see him.

117
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,280
Empress Dowager

118
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,560
treats me better than him.

119
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,120
Empress Dowager?

120
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,325
Not only did she personally come to visit me,

121
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,280
she even harshly punished that Little Zou.

122
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,840
I heard that she got slapped a few times

123
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,040
that harmed her face.

124
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,800
But General instead cared for her

125
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,800
in a spoiled manner

126
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,320
and invited so many doctors to see her.

127
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,720
Empress Dowager...

128
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,720
Stop the carriage!

129
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,000
What's wrong, Big Madam?

130
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,920
What's wrong, Big Madam?

131
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,200
Turn around and go to the palace.

132
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,200
Go to the palace? Now?

133
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,222
Yes.
Go to the palace? Now?

134
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:29,777
Yes.

135
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,480
This is Marquess Sheng of

136
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,440
the Marquis of Ningyuan Manor.

137
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,932
She especially came here to thank Empress

138
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:39,680
for her kind graces.

139
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,880
Please wait for a while.

140
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,120
Little Zou indeed did a despicable thing.

141
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,360
But Her Highness Empress Dowager

142
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,440
has already punished her

143
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,560
with dozens of slaps

144
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,040
and put her in house arrest.

145
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,720
I think that's enough.

146
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,600
Your Highness,

147
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,700
even if you don't consider the sake of

148
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,160
the Eldest Lady Zou,

149
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,960
you must consider the pride of State Uncle.

150
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,160
Right now, those old aristocrats of Bianjing

151
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,800
are still unforgiving.

152
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,600
What do they really want?

153
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,840
Do they want His Majesty and Empress

154
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,160
to bow to them?

155
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,280
Sister,

156
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,120
His Majesty has already taken a step back

157
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,325
and would only address his birth father as Royal Father

158
00:07:21,325 --> 00:07:22,160
and not give him any posthumos title.

159
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,840
But they didn't

160
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,480
accept it and instead kept

161
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,600
pressured His Majesty.

162
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,640
Now,

163
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,800
even nephew fell into their hands.

164
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,240
General Xiao Duan

165
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,120
has to go to the local court for questioning everyday.

166
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,440
We almost had no one to send for the salt inspection.

167
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,440
If we keep retreating like this,

168
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,440
we won't have any more path to retreat to.

169
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,472
how could there be

170
00:07:42,472 --> 00:07:43,840
an emperor and empress

171
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,240
yielding to their subjects?

172
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,680
You have all worked hard

173
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,240
for thinking of ideas for me for a whole day.

174
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,760
You must be tired.

175
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
Disperse

176
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,720
and go home to rest.

177
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,120
Madam Sheng, how's your health?

178
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,720
I'm fine.

179
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,120
I especially came to thank you

180
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,400
for the jewelries and valuable items you had sent me.

181
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,520
All those are just trifle matters.

182
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,320
Your husband has left to inspect salt.

183
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,040
I'm sure that he's not at ease

184
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,520
to leave you alone in the capital.

185
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,840
Empress Dowager released a decree

186
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,640
to slap Little Zou's face fifty times.

187
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,200
After slapping her twenty plus times,

188
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,200
my little brother couldn't take it anymore

189
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,840
and stopped the eunuch implementing the decree.

190
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,400
When they were arguing,

191
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,520
the eunuch slipped,

192
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,680
fell off the platform,

193
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,240
Sit down and let's talk.

194
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,920
In the past,

195
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,240
they caused a huge ruckus in your house's banquet.

196
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,640
Not only did you tolerate it,

197
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,640
but also went to convince Lady Zhang.

198
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,840
But just after a few good days,

199
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,680
they again caused troubles.

200
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,440
If you didn't come today,

201
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,960
I will call for you tomorrow

202
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,000
for some chat.

203
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,680
Since it was Empress Dowager's eunuch

204
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,520
that got injured,

205
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,320
did she say anything?

206
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,600
Empress Dowager was very considerate of His Majesty

207
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,520
and didn't say anything.

208
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,240
Your marquis husband

209
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,520
is a loyal and brave man.

210
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,520
Whenever there is danger,

211
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,960
he would always put himself before everyone

212
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,000
and share the burden of His Majesty.

213
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,880
I find your words frightening.

214
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,600
Sharing the burden of the emperor

215
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,880
is the duty of all subjects.

216
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,520
But this time,

217
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,720
my Marquis Husband didn't do it just for His Majesty,

218
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,920
he also did it for General Shen

219
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,200
and General Duan.

220
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,000
For them?

221
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,185
My Marquis Husband accompanied

222
00:10:11,185 --> 00:10:11,960
Prince Huan to the south

223
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,840
because His Majesty can't be at ease

224
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,320
to entrust Prince Huan's safety

225
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,880
to other people

226
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,000
other than

227
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,440
those old generals from Yuzhou.

228
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,040
That's right.

229
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,760
In their journey to the south,

230
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,321
Prince Huan has already faced

231
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:26,480
two assassination plots against him.

232
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,425
Fortunately,

233
00:10:27,425 --> 00:10:29,640
your Marquis Gu resisted them all.

234
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,960
What?!

235
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,320
You don't know?

236
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,200
I...

237
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,240
Quickly sit down. Take care of your baby.

238
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,200
I'm pregnant.

239
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,040
If there's another choice,

240
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,600
I would never let my husband

241
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,400
risk his life.

242
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,520
Those were my selfish words.

243
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,520
I hope you can understand.

244
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,280
His Majesty has very few trusted aides.

245
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,560
If he had other choices,

246
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,280
he wouldn't let Marquis Gu leave the capital.

247
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,480
Now, if we lose Duke Ying of the State

248
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,080
and hurt the heart of Bianjing,

249
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,560
his power and loyal subjects will surely dwindle.

250
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,280
His Majesty has already achieved the throne.

251
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,014
He's making every effort

252
00:11:37,014 --> 00:11:38,320
to make the country prosperous and has great aspirations.

253
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,920
He mustn't

254
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,520
maintain this stiff relationship

255
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,640
with those old Bianjing subjects.

256
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,600
Didn't His Majesty decide on the marriage

257
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,680
of General Shen and the House of Zhang

258
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,920
exactly because he

259
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,560
wanted to merge

260
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,000
with those old Bianjing subjects as one body?

261
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,160
Then...how should we do it?

262
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,520
What I'm about to say might offend the imperial family.

263
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,040
I asked you to stay

264
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,520
because I want you to talk.

265
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,120
Say it.

266
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,720
During the Three Kingdoms Era,

267
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,400
Cao Cao ordered

268
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,068
that if there were any soldiers whose horse

269
00:12:21,068 --> 00:12:22,320
would step on the fields of good citizens,

270
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,600
all would be executed.

271
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,960
When Cao Cao's own horse got frightened

272
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,040
and charged into the cornfield,

273
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,520
although the landlord dare not punish Cao Cao,

274
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Cao Cao still cut off his hair in place of his head.

275
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,400
He punished himself

276
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,520
so others would follow his example.

277
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,080
Guo Ai, the son of Guo Ziyi from the previous dynasty,

278
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,280
married a princess.

279
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,019
After getting married, he had an altercation

280
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:44,240
with the princess and berated at her.

281
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,283
Offending one's superior,

282
00:12:46,283 --> 00:12:47,680
how grave is that crime?

283
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,520
Princess returned to the palace and told his husband.

284
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,040
Tang Daizong scolded his daughter

285
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,040
for using her power to bully other people.

286
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,000
He directly said that Guo Ziyi can be the emperor,

287
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,766
hence, the Guo Family became so loyal

288
00:12:57,766 --> 00:12:59,280
to the empire ever since.

289
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,920
I understand now.

290
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,480
You... You

291
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,400
really said those words?

292
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,360
You're too bold.

293
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,360
Just any bit of mistakes

294
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,840
and you would have invited fire to burn yourself.

295
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,640
Her Highness called so many people for an audience,

296
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,080
except for me.

297
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,200
If it's not because she dislikes me,

298
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,400
then it's because

299
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,280
she wants to find another time to see me

300
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,320
and hear other words.

301
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,440
When I arrived in her palace,

302
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,480
those people

303
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,520
said a lot,

304
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,640
but I never said anything.

305
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,640
But when we're about to leave,

306
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,560
Her Highness asked only me to stay.

307
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,960
Why was that then?

308
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,440
It was because Her Highness feel

309
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,520
that the words they all said

310
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,760
were useless.

311
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,760
Since you're so smart and full of insights,

312
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,440
tell me then,

313
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,480
when will this storm end?

314
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,600
It started with the Shen Family,

315
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,040
so they must be the one to placate it.

316
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,250
Regarding the matter of Prince Shu

317
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,080
being respected as the biological father,

318
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,460
although they were able to

319
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,200
get half of the court's support,

320
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,080
they also lost half.

321
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,675
We're truly in very dangerous times

322
00:14:26,675 --> 00:14:27,680
that concerns survival right now,

323
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,120
we mustn't let the ripples become huge waves.

324
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,240
If it gets bigger,

325
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,760
I fear that this capital

326
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,160
would be floating amidst a storm.

327
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,600
Who would have expected

328
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,960
that you would be discussing about

329
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,600
the government here now?

330
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,560
If you're a man,

331
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,640
you surely won't be inferior

332
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,640
to your father and Changbai in politics.

333
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,960
Grandmother's words

334
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,600
may sound like you're praising me,

335
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,400
but in reality,

336
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,240
you're praising yourself, right?

337
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,240
How am I praising myself?

338
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,200
I grew up by your side,

339
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,800
that's why, I became this smart.

340
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,640
Aren't you then praising yourself?

341
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,480
I've never heard of anyone

342
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,480
praising themselves

343
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,720
in such cheesy manner like you do.

344
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,880
You little macaque!

345
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,080
You dare to make me your past time now.

346
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,280
Look at that.

347
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,720
Your Highness,

348
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,920
you've been sitting here the whole night.

349
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,240
In a few moment,

350
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,800
people from other palaces will come to greet you.

351
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,560
Why don't you go rest for a while?

352
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,800
Nanny Su,

353
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,560
remove my outer robe

354
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,560
and make-up.

355
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,000
I'll tell the other palaces then

356
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,200
that you're not feeling well today,

357
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,640
hence, no need for greetings.

358
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,000
No.

359
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,440
Don't cancel it.

360
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Let them come.

361
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,520
Let them see it.

362
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,200
Let them spread it.

363
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,600
Your Highness.

364
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,640
Go and get my headdress

365
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,160
with a huge pearl on it.

366
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,680
Your Highness.

367
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,840
Deliver this to the ducal house of the Zhang Family.

368
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,440
Tell them

369
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,920
that it was all my fault that the Shen Family

370
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,520
favored Little Lady Zou.

371
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,720
Cao Cao cut off his hair in place of his head.

372
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,080
Ask them to accept this precious pearl

373
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,080
and treat it as my punishment.

374
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,200
Your Highness,

375
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,120
but you're the empress.

376
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,240
Zhuxiang,

377
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,680
after removing my head adornments and imperial robe,

378
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,400
let's go to His Majesty and ask for punishment.

379
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,160
Yes.

380
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,800
You all get up now.

381
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,160
Asking for punishment from His Majesty?

382
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,880
But His Majesty has never

383
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,960
said anything.

384
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,120
This is a trouble that the Shen Family started.

385
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,520
Of course, it should be our family that must pacify it.

386
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,160
I want you to personally deliver it.

387
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,560
Your Highness Empress!

388
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,600
Your Majesty, have you read my memorial?

389
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,760
The attendants of Empress Dowager

390
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,880
went there to implement her imperial decree.

391
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,760
General Shen instead hurt one of them.

392
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:14,920
About this matter,

393
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,800
the imperial court has been deliberating

394
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,160
about it for 7 to 8 days.

395
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,800
May I ask Your Majesty how you plan to deal with it?

396
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,720
I indeed am paying attention to it.

397
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,760
Your Majesty,

398
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,760
Empress Dowager is staring her attack,

399
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,840
yet you kept delaying giving your decision.

400
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:44,950
Do you plan to harbor private interest

401
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,040
and disregard the law?

402
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,680
Have you forgotten your grand aspirations

403
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,320
after ascending the throne?

404
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,520
Have you forgotten the soldiers guarding our borders?

405
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,476
Have you forgotten about the territories

406
00:20:55,476 --> 00:20:56,800
that have fallen into the hands of our enemies?

407
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,520
Prime Minister, you said it too seriously.

408
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,800
By helping you

409
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,816
fight to have your deceased father

410
00:21:04,816 --> 00:21:05,720
Prince Shu garner some respect,

411
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,960
I've already bore numerous fawning

412
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,640
and despicable reputation.

413
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:14,240
But I'm not afraid of them nor am I regretting for it.

414
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,840
I did it for the future of this government.

415
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,160
Today,

416
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,200
if Your Majesty is going to favor your relatives

417
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,951
leading to the loosening of the government foundation

418
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:26,960
and destruction of court order,

419
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,720
I also would not agree to that!

420
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,002
Prime Minister Han,

421
00:21:36,002 --> 00:21:36,920
there's something that you don't know.

422
00:21:38,025 --> 00:21:40,160
The past Big Madam Zou...

423
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,000
Your Majesty!

424
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,680
What empress owed the Zou Family was a private favor.

425
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,468
What General Shen owed the Duke Ying

426
00:21:48,468 --> 00:21:49,600
of the State was a state favor.

427
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,640
How could you discuss those two together?

428
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,840
I, a lady of Shen, has committed a crime!

429
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,240
I failed in restricting my family.

430
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,775
I especially come here to ask for punishment

431
00:22:04,775 --> 00:22:05,520
from Your Majesty!

432
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,120
Your Highness!

433
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,360
Your Highness!

434
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,320
I, a lady of Shen, has committed a crime!

435
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,840
I failed in restricting my family.

436
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,475
I especially come here

437
00:22:17,475 --> 00:22:19,000
to ask for punishment from Your Majesty!

438
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,960
I...

439
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,160
Your Majesty,

440
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,080
I sit on the throne of the Kuning Palace Hall,

441
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,920
but didn't follow its rules.

442
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,720
I am ashamed to face you.

443
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:43,800
I am ashamed to face the

444
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,840
the grand empire established by our ancestors.

445
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,120
I have failed the teaching of Empress Dowager.

446
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,777
I am also ashamed to face an old able general

447
00:22:50,777 --> 00:22:52,120
like Duke Ying of the State.

448
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,760
Your Majesty,

449
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,440
please punish me.

450
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,440
I'm willing to accept it.

451
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,320
Empress.

452
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,160
You are my empress.

453
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,680
You accompanied me

454
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,920
to survive our days in Yuzhou.

455
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,920
Your mistake

456
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,960
is my mistake.

457
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,880
If you are asking for punishment,

458
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,920
then it means that I must ask for punishment too.

459
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,720
Let's go ask for punishment

460
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,640
from Empress Dowager together.

461
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,840
Since our empire was established,

462
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,640
no one acted like how the empress did.

463
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,200
She has really brought shame to

464
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,080
our imperial family.

465
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,520
His Majesty has been resting in his palace

466
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,320
all this time and seems to

467
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,400
have no desire to punish her.

468
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,840
He did lecture her last night.

469
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,720
You heard and saw it?

470
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,880
Didn't she go ask for punishment now?

471
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,000
His Majesty must be spurning her now.

472
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,040
Have you seen any empress

473
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,035
who is willing to bow down

474
00:24:20,035 --> 00:24:21,660
and admit their mistake to a subject?

475
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,520
And which empress

476
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,000
has ever cried right in front of her throne room?

477
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,880
This is called destroying one's pride.

478
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,280
Nothing can be lower than that.

479
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,000
This matter has occurred for so many days,

480
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,360
but she just held out.

481
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,720
His Majesty held out.

482
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,240
Hence, I found a chance to intervene.

483
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,880
Who gave her the idea to admit her mistakes

484
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,040
and asked for punishment?

485
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,000
She actually learned to do this trick?

486
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,520
Even if she's able to get past His Majesty,

487
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,565
a thorn has already been embedded

488
00:24:48,565 --> 00:24:49,320
in His Majesty's heart.

489
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,640
With the emperor and empress not being united,

490
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,600
everything can be easily done.

491
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,320
Empress Dowager.

492
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,040
What is it?

493
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,440
His Majesty and Empress are here.

494
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,080
His Majesty came with the Empress?

495
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,080
His Majesty...

496
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,040
Quickly bring her to the

497
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,640
inner rooms to hide.

498
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,520
His Majesty asks you to go out.

499
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,760
What?

500
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,320
Asking me to go out?

501
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,080
Your son, Zhao Zongquan...

502
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,440
Your daughter-in-law, Shen Congying...

503
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,760
Respectfully wishing Empress Dowager good health

504
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,640
and especially came here to ask for punishment!

505
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,160
Weibei General Shen Congxing

506
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,320
protected his concubine

507
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,520
and offended your close attendant.

508
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,480
I, your son Zhao Zongquan,

509
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,840
and your daughter-in-law, Shen Congying,

510
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,320
especially came here to seek punishment.

511
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,080
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry and get up.

512
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,975
Quickly get up,

513
00:26:14,975 --> 00:26:16,080
Your Majesty.

514
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:16,840
Get up.

515
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,840
Quickly get up. Quickly get up.

516
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,080
Emperor,

517
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,040
why the need for such grand bows?

518
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,240
You are scaring me.

519
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,200
The two of us are just doing

520
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,840
appropriate work for the empire.

521
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,720
What crime can there be?

522
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,925
Emperor,

523
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,560
you mustn't listen to the instigation

524
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,920
of other people.

525
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,560
Weibei General Shen Congxing

526
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,520
favored one's concubine and harmed one's main wife,

527
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,327
is to be punished with 20 caning

528
00:27:02,327 --> 00:27:04,320
and without salary for a year.

529
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,680
Stay indoor and reflect on your mistakes.

530
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,320
Concubine Zou,

531
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,228
you've become arrogant for being highly favored,

532
00:27:09,228 --> 00:27:10,720
and have offended your superior.

533
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,637
Empress Dowager has given an imperial decree

534
00:27:12,637 --> 00:27:13,920
that you should be punished with 50 slapping,

535
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,625
your conferred title would be removed,

536
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:17,000
and you will be locked inside a very simple room.

537
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,275
You're not allowed to attend to your husband

538
00:27:18,275 --> 00:27:18,560
from now on.

539
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,440
Zou Chu detained the royal physician.

540
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,447
and almost causing Main Madam Shen

541
00:27:23,447 --> 00:27:24,440
to have a difficult labor.

542
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,880
You are to be caned 30 times

543
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,847
and compensate the House of Duke Ying of the State

544
00:27:27,847 --> 00:27:29,800
with 10,000 strings of silver

545
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,920
to be earmarked as assets of Madam Zhang.

546
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,720
General Shen, accept the imperial decree.

547
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:36,987
I, subject Shen Congxing ,

548
00:27:36,987 --> 00:27:38,185
who has committed a mistake, is accepting the decree.

549
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,760
Thank you for His Majesty's graces!

550
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,720
Official...

551
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,920
Official, just let my older brother go.

552
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:46,800
Official...

553
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,475
Zou Ming, you forcefully occupied

554
00:27:50,475 --> 00:27:51,440
the farmlands of an ordinary citizen,

555
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,120
which ended up with the death of one person.

556
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,160
The court has already given a sentence.

557
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,120
You are to be exiled 3,000 miles in the northwest.

558
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,160
State Uncle, take good care of yourself.

559
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,040
Respectfully sending off His Majesty's envoy.

560
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,120
Brother-in-law...

561
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,075
Brother-in-law,

562
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:21,040
save my older brother.

563
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,640
Brother-in-law,

564
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
my older brother grew up

565
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,080
with my older sister.

566
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,200
Servant.

567
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,240
You've carried him while riding your horse.

568
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,200
Have you forgotten?

569
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,000
Servant!

570
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,160
Assist Little Madam away!

571
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,724
Brother-in-law, don't you care about me anymore?

572
00:28:32,724 --> 00:28:34,068
Slap her mouth and lock her up!

573
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,720
Brother-in-law! Sister!

574
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,000
Brother-in-law,

575
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,040
for the sake of my deceased older sister,

576
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,320
just spare my little sister!

577
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,360
Brother-in-law!

578
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,360
Sister,

579
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,680
can you see it?

580
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,680
All the people in this world

581
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,480
have no conscience!

582
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,560
When the person leave, the tea gets cold.

583
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,760
Now that General

584
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,200
has a new wife and son,

585
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,280
he has forgotten about you!

586
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,480
Daughter.

587
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,880
If you don't want to go back,

588
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,960
we'll inform His Majesty about it right away.

589
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,160
Things have already become like this.

590
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,920
There's no turning back.

591
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,240
Child.

592
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,720
Your father and I

593
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,400
have planned it.

594
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,680
We can say that after going through this ordeal,

595
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,960
you've realized your big mistake.

596
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,520
You'd rather stay aloof from worldly matters,

597
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,840
go to the mountains, and be a daoist nun.

598
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,800
Your father and I will then go to

599
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,640
the Shen Family to placate things.

600
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,200
We'll say that

601
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,280
even if you've converted to serve the deities,

602
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,720
we and them are

603
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,120
still in-laws.

604
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,560
In this way,

605
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,600
His Majesty will have

606
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,840
nothing to say.

607
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,600
Live in the daoist temple for several years.

608
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,120
Once this matter has passed,

609
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,200
we'll let the child go to the monastery

610
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,280
to cry a few times.

611
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,480
We'll then be able to successfully fetch you back

612
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,800
to our house for secluded cultivation.

613
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,120
Our family can still reunite.

614
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,320
The stage has been placed.

615
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,400
How could the performing actor not come out to act?

616
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,920
Father and mother have raised me.

617
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,120
Why can't I fight my way out

618
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,000
to obtain my own piece of world?

619
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,760
Congratulations! Congratulations!

620
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,000
Okay. Okay.

621
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,000
Please go in. Please go in.

622
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,920
Official Zhang, you're here.

623
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,920
Congratulations.

624
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,720
Thanks. Thanks.

625
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,160
Please go inside.

626
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,520
Empress Dowager.

627
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,720
I personally saw the

628
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,000
eight dukes of state

629
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,840
going to the manor of State Uncle.

630
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,160
Half of the Censorate also came,

631
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,320
and those who didn't go there also sent their gifts.

632
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,640
All the military officials are almost there.

633
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,080
Half of the scholarly officials didn't go,

634
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,440
but their families did.

635
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,880
Say, those heartless things,

636
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,000
they

637
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,440
actually all went!

638
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,840
What's there to be surprised about?

639
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,640
Have you seen any empress

640
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,200
without a headdress and wearing plain clothes

641
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,340
kneeling outside a palace hall,

642
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,360
begging for forgiveness and asking for punishment?

643
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,840
And how many people

644
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,920
are able to receive the pearl

645
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,720
in an empress' headdress as a compensation?

646
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,960
Those old subjects...

647
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,920
The old loyal ones are getting fewer and fewer...

648
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,520
You two scoundrels!

649
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,720
Go out!

650
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,160
You don't have right to tie me up!

651
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,680
Get lost!

652
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,240
Release me!

653
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,880
Yuzhen! Yuzhen!

654
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,400
Save me!

655
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,200
If not because of my older sister,

656
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,720
you all would have died

657
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,280
in god knows where!

658
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,360
Let go of me!

659
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,440
Ungrateful bastards!

660
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,160
You even know who has carried you?

661
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,725
At such young age,

662
00:32:34,725 --> 00:32:35,602
you already know who is holding you?

663
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,400
Don't cry anymore.

664
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,200
What's wrong?

665
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,720
It's you.

666
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,640
It's you who sent Sister Ping away.

667
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,920
Even if you have any anger,

668
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,160
you mustn't destroy

669
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,800
your older brother's event today.

670
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,240
I know that Sister Ping offended

671
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:32,000
the empress dowager

672
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,360
hence,

673
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,000
she committed a unpardonable crime.

674
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,160
But is there anyway we can save her?

675
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,150
Towards our family,

676
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,000
eldest sister-in-law... I...

677
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,480
This is already the best ending.

678
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,160
All three were able to preserve their lives.

679
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,880
If I continue to indulge them,

680
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,511
their assets will get confiscated and their clan executed.

681
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,400
But older brother,

682
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,600
how come ever since we entered the capital,

683
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,440
it's always our family

684
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,320
that's wrong?

685
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,200
Are you doing well in your husband's house?

686
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,200
He didn't make things difficult for you

687
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,240
because of our family's matter?

688
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:01,800
He didn't.

689
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:05,840
Older Brother,

690
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,280
look at this room.

691
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:08,720
Sister Ping

692
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,040
was dragged away!

693
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,532
Nanny Su was

694
00:34:11,532 --> 00:34:12,840
really so ruthless!

695
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,040
I...

696
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,200
I'll take my leave now.

697
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,680
You can't go!

698
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,320
It's because of you.

699
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,240
My older sister asked you

700
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,760
to stay and the next day,

701
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,800
the palace released a decree...

702
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,600
Shut up!

703
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,680
You just fling your arms so cleanly.

704
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,080
What about my sister-in-law?!

705
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,480
Looks like

706
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,520
I've spoiled you too much too!

707
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,320
Older brother,

708
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,240
have you forgotten about sister-in-law?!

709
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,040
I...

710
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:39,840
General Shen!

711
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,000
I...

712
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,320
General,

713
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,960
loving a person is enough to put him in harm's way.

714
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,500
Loving someone too much to the point

715
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,480
of indulging will cause a deadly disaster.

716
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,800
You've committed a mistake from the start.

717
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,600
I've committed a wrong step,

718
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,120
and all my steps thereafter were wrong.

719
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,600
You have obtained great wealth

720
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,680
and had the heart to assist the Zou Family.

721
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,080
But because you've always treated

722
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,280
Third Miss like your own little sister,

723
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,560
you hesitated

724
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,680
and wouldn't marry anyone.

725
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,480
That is your first mistake.

726
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,080
Since you can't marry her as a main wife,

727
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,880
you should have just

728
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:15,960
continuously treated her as a little sister.

729
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,480
Find her a good family.

730
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,800
But you instead took her in as a concubine.

731
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,320
That's your second mistake.

732
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,560
What do you know?

733
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,680
My older brother has a predicament.

734
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,440
He was trying to preserve the status

735
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,960
and wealth of the Zou Family.

736
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,800
We will never be able to pay back

737
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,760
what we owed the Zou Family.

738
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,400
Hence, you two,

739
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,880
including Her Highness Empress,

740
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,360
cannot do anything to restrict the actions

741
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,440
of Concubine Zou.

742
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,400
That is the third mistake.

743
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,440
When empress made the decision,

744
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,120
you think she was not in pain?

745
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,840
She was. But regardless,

746
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,800
she has to do it.

747
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,640
It's not only for now.

748
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,720
It's more for the future.

749
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,280
Future?

750
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,480
You're saying Prince Huan...

751
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,080
What should we do now?

752
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,000
What should we not do?

753
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,280
First,

754
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,200
His Majesty will still heavily use

755
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,160
General Shen.

756
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,240
Second,

757
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,080
since the two families didn't amicably separate,

758
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,920
the House of Duke Ying of the State

759
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,120
will not allow anything bad to happen to you.

760
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:21,960
If in the future...

761
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,160
Hence, General,

762
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,150
you just need to stay at home

763
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,040
and recuperate your strength.

764
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,040
His Majesty still have important tasks to

765
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,200
entrust you in the future.

766
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,160
After saying so much, what

767
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,200
about Sister Ping?

768
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,440
She has already been taken to

769
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,560
the farmstead outside of the city.

770
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,440
Can she still come back?

771
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,880
She's only a few years older than me.

772
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,154
Your nephew,

773
00:36:46,154 --> 00:36:47,600
the eldest legitimate child of the House of Shen,

774
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,920
is already more than 13 years old.

775
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,360
He still has two little sisters,

776
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,080
one 5 and one 7.

777
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:56,880
So what?

778
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,200
With Concubine Zou here,

779
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,760
Big Madam Zhang

780
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,680
can never truly become

781
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,840
their legitimate mother.

782
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,360
If children are

783
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,200
brought up by a concubine,

784
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,920
just by that,

785
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,680
all those good families outside

786
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,080
would avoid them.

787
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,160
Your nephew can still inherit a nobility title,

788
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,200
so fine.

789
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,160
But what about those nieces of yours?

790
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,800
They have to be married off.

791
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,600
They are the real flesh and

792
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,680
blood of your first sister-in-law.

793
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,960
If she has consciousness below

794
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,760
and learns that her children

795
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,520
don't end up well,

796
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,240
how sad will she be?

797
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,080
My first sister-in-law has such a hard fate.

798
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,520
Take good care of yourself.

799
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,920
You also must be careful.

800
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,360
Take care on your way.

801
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,040
Miss! Miss!

802
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,360
Quickly go back and take a look!

803
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,920
Old Madam is dying!

804
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,000
What happened?

805
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,800
Old Madam fainted.

806
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,120
The doctor only said that she's sick,

807
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,440
but couldn't determine what's wrong.

808
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,640
Until now, she still hasn't woken up!

809
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:01,920
Quickly take my name card

810
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:02,800
and find a royal physician in the palace!

811
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,480
Yes!

812
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,960
She was still well this morning,

813
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,760
but started feeling unwell by the afternoon.

814
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,880
Old Madam didn't want us to call for a doctor.

815
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,160
But when we were setting up her food,

816
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,640
Old Madam then fainted.

817
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,920
Miss, you are pregnant

818
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,920
and shouldn't be going.

819
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,040
But I then thought that

820
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,920
Old Madam dotes on you the most.

821
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,440
I fear that if anything bad is to happen,

822
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,760
she surely would want to see you!

823
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,680
Miss,

824
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,520
what should we do?

825
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,720
Royal physician,

826
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,640
what's wrong with my mother?

827
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,868
Old Madam must recuperate properly.

828
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,160
There mustn't be too much people in the room.

829
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:56,720
Okay.

830
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,480
Official Sheng,

831
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,120
let's talk in private.

832
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,880
Okay. Okay. Please.

833
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,040
Little Sister, you go and listen to.

834
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,200
I'll be here to attend to her.

835
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,480
Thank you, sister-in-law.

836
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,840
Please go inside.

837
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,840
Okay. Okay.

838
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,000
Please sit down.

839
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,400
Doctor,

840
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,480
what's wrong with my mother?

841
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,070
This...

842
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,760
It's hard to say it.

843
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,200
Royal Physician, just say it.

844
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,240
We can afford any medicines.

845
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,440
Anyway, I've stabilized her condition at the present.

846
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,240
Just nurse her well in the coming days.

847
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,560
Doctor, you have miraculous skills.

848
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,720
Doctor, we've caused you to exert yourself.

849
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,760
If there's anything that you need,

850
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,920
just tell us.

851
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,360
I surely will do my best to fulfill them.

852
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,320
Official, your filial piety can move the heavens.

853
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,880
Doctor,

854
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,680
my grandmother is always very healthy.

855
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,840
She has been well all this time.

856
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,200
How come she would fell ill

857
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,120
just like that?

858
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,560
Royal physician,

859
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,280
why do you think so?

860
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,360
Asking the royal physician to come this late at night

861
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,800
is already troubling him too much.

862
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:53,750
How can you be disrespectful

863
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:54,280
and kept interrogating him?

864
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,320
Royal physician has his own considerations.

865
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,880
It's fine. It's fine.

866
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,240
A doctor has a heart like that of a parent.

867
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,200
Old Madam is very old.

868
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,840
Her health can't compare to that of young ones.

869
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,600
It's just normal for her

870
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,240
to experience some illness.

871
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,720
This...

872
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,800
It's very hard to say which area

873
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,560
is wrong at this point.

874
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I must slowly observe.

875
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,240
Hard to say?

876
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,000
It's just that she's too old.

877
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,120
I initially planned to wait for tomorrow

878
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:34,920
before informing Ming'er about this.

879
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,840
Who knew that the servants are that talkative

880
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,720
and brought you here tonight.

881
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,800
It's like we don't know how to

882
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,920
take care of her.

883
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,600
Can you speak less?

884
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,000
The child is just being filial.

885
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:45,880
Why do you still have to argue with her?

886
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,040
What did I argue about?

887
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:48,920
Official.

888
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,240
Just follow this formula and brew her medicine.

889
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:54,600
Okay.

890
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,760
Although grandmother has been stabilized,

891
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,040
she still hasn't woken up.

892
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,160
I hope that royal physician can stay for one night,

893
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,840
so we all can be at ease.

894
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,320
If grandmother have an attack at night,

895
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,920
we all might be panic and be at lost,

896
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,040
causing us to delay her treatment.

897
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,240
That's right.

898
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,120
Hope doctor can exert more efforts.

899
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,760
It's just normal for people like us

900
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,280
to be called in the middle of the night.

901
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,800
Official, please be at ease.

902
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,640
I'll just stay for the night.

903
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,720
Thank you then, doctor.

904
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,640
Thank you, doctor.

905
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,680
This is great.

906
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,080
Ming'er,

907
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,200
if there's nothing else,

908
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,480
go back to your manor first.

909
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,160
If anything happens,

910
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,400
I'll send people to call you.

911
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,640
No, father.

912
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,520
Just let me stay by

913
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,680
grandmother's side for tonight,

914
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,480
so I could practice my filial piety.

915
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,960
Okay. Stay then.

916
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,240
I'll guard by mother's side for tonight,

917
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,760
so that she has someone by her side

918
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,600
if ever her illness situation changes.

919
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,080
Father,

920
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,440
you still have to attend the morning court tomorrow.

921
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,640
The night is also late.

922
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,760
You and Main Mother

923
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,160
should go back to your room to rest.

924
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,080
Being absent for a day is also no big deal.

925
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,600
You are old.

926
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,920
If there's anything, let the younger ones do the work.

927
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,320
You still have me.

928
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,440
You are the pillar of this family.

929
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,080
If anything major happens in the family,

930
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,960
you still have to handle the general situation.

931
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,600
Minger.What you said is right too.

932
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,040
Okay.

933
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,160
Doctor,

934
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,000
sorry to have

935
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,440
troubled you.
