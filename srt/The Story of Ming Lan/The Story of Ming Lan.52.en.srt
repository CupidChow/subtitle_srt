00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Ming Lan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,580
Episode 52

3
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,480
Old Madam, eat more.

4
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,920
Not anymore.

5
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,280
Old Madam,

6
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,000
you're still worrying about Miss Ming?

7
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,800
She's just a little child.

8
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,920
I initially planned to peacefully and steadily

9
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,240
marry her to a middle-class family,

10
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,200
so she could have a carefree and sweet life.

11
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,560
But she ended up to the Gu Family,

12
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,440
a place filled with problems.

13
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,280
Really...

14
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,520
Old Madam,

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,600
Sixth Miss and Master are quarreling

16
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,600
in the front receiving hall.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,440
What?!

18
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,320
Fourth Miss

19
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,100
insists to have the memorial tablet

20
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:39,680
of Concubine Lin be placed

21
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,880
in Yuqing Monastery.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,240
Sixth Miss persistently refusing, hence,

23
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,480
she got scolded by Master.

24
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,040
Let's go take a look.

25
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,520
Faster, faster!

26
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,440
Old Madam, please relax.

27
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,360
Miss is composed and tolerant.

28
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,160
She's able to be very patient

29
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,760
and would think about things thoroughly.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,040
She would never

31
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,080
contradict Master

32
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,360
just for these trifle matters.

33
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,960
You don't know her.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,400
This girl is good in anything.

35
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,750
She doesn't like causing problems,

36
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,560
nor is afraid to face them.

37
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,160
But when Lin Qinshuang is mentioned,

38
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,680
she'll eat you up.

39
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,480
Let's move quickly.

40
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,920
Fourth Sister,

41
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,760
if you just lived your own life,

42
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,400
not using that concubine's name

43
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,200
to act delicate and aggrieved

44
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,640
in front of my father,

45
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,480
the two of us can

46
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,920
have a harmonious relationship.

47
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:21,640
But you just have to

48
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,840
rip this gauze apart

49
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,200
and stuff it in my mouth to disgust me.

50
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,880
Then, don't blame me for embarrassing you.

51
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,680
Preposterous!

52
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,720
Don't think that

53
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,500
because you're now the wife of

54
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,200
a highly favored official,

55
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,900
you can act unreasonably

56
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,760
and make drama in front of me!

57
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,560
Really…

58
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,040
Father,

59
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,400
when I organized a prayer ritual

60
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,000
for my Mother,

61
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,475
I only begged you to stop by

62
00:02:41,475 --> 00:02:42,440
and watch the ritual for a while.

63
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,900
But you said that you were busy

64
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,680
and not willing to go.

65
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,200
How did my Little mother die

66
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,440
because of difficult delivery of a huge infant?

67
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,240
How come the doctor never return

68
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,840
after checked her once?

69
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,360
What is the intention of Lin Qinshuang

70
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,120
sending her so many nourishing food

71
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,000
that time like a flowing river,

72
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,960
have you thought about that?!

73
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,920
Shut up!

74
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,400
What are you doing?

75
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,040
Why you bring up

76
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,480
these past things?

77
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,600
Are you

78
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,800
interrogating me?

79
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,080
You forced me to do it!

80
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,325
Lin Qinshuang indulged her daughter

81
00:03:13,325 --> 00:03:14,200
to secretly have an affair,

82
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,000
hence, this marriage came to fruition.

83
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,425
That time, you were so mad

84
00:03:18,425 --> 00:03:19,240
that you were grinding your teeth.

85
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,320
Now, it just past a while,,

86
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,480
but you already forgot all about it?

87
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,680
What nonsense are you saying?

88
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,600
but you already forgot all about it?

89
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,880
How can this never happened?

90
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,880
Sixth Miss,

91
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,360
you must be cautious with your words.

92
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,200
You think that because you now have a husband,

93
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,280
as a father,

94
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,280
I don't dare to discipline you anymore?

95
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,440
Let me discipline you today then!

96
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,400
Father-in-law!

97
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,280
Wife, I came to pick you to home.

98
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,800
But looks like, I came in a bad time.

99
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,080
But it also seems to be the right time.

100
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,720
It is the right time.

101
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,880
Sixth Son-in-law, have you eaten?

102
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,040
How about sitting down first

103
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,640
and have a meal?

104
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,520
Husband,

105
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,240
I'm unable to eat this meal anymore.

106
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,000
Let's go home now.

107
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,025
Fourth Sister-in-law's mother is suspected

108
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:35,840
to have killed someone.

109
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,880
I think that it's not right for her to appear

110
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,800
in Yuqing Monastery,

111
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,880
nor appear in the genealogy book

112
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,280
of the Sheng Clan.

113
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,880
What nonsense are you spouting?

114
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,320
How can that be?

115
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,560
She after all

116
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,680
provided our Sheng family a son.

117
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,280
How could she be removed...

118
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,400
Father-in-law,

119
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,160
just for the reputation

120
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,080
of the Sheng Family,

121
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,280
the scholarly honor of his older brother,

122
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,320
the good name of her older sister,

123
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,640
my wife has been enduring everything until now.

124
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,680
In being a person.

125
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,760
For you dote on others,

126
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,120
others will also dote on you.

127
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,720
On the contrary,

128
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,520
you all is using

129
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,800
her benevolent heart

130
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,880
to threaten her!

131
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,160
That doesn't seem suitable.

132
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,120
Moreover,

133
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,520
Brother Changfeng

134
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,000
will be taking the imperial exam too.

135
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,360
If he has

136
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,720
a murderer mother,

137
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,080
I'm afraid that it won't be good if that gets out.

138
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,640
You two!

139
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,440
you think you can have the final say here?

140
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,000
Just shut up!

141
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,600
Let's go.

142
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,480
We're not going in anymore?

143
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,560
Someone's defending her now.

144
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,440
Why would I still go in?

145
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,240
Once I've handled the matter here

146
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,360
in the Sheng family well,

147
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,640
she'll naturally be well.

148
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,800
Here, try this.

149
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,440
This is the cheese cake from Qiu Hall.

150
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,680
It's a new coming product.

151
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,920
Xiaotao and Danju love to eat this.

152
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,160
Let's just leave it for them.

153
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,200
You...

154
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,680
You have always been very calm and steady.

155
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,880
I've never seen

156
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,080
you like this.

157
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,120
You now realized that I've fallen into a trap.

158
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,920
I love you when you're gentle.

159
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,640
I also love it when you're so domineering

160
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,760
and tearing other

161
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,600
people's fake mask.

162
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,680
Wrong. I like it more.

163
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,560
Thinking about it now,

164
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,600
you're able to be calm before,

165
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,000
because you

166
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,280
don't really care.

167
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,320
But your love for your mother

168
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,960
is the deepest.

169
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,760
Hearing the words

170
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,560
you said for your mother,

171
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,440
seeing the things

172
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,440
you've done for your mother,

173
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,840
I would then think about

174
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,520
how I'm unable to do anything

175
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,480
for my mother anymore.

176
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,120
You have done for her the thing

177
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,560
that she would have loved to do the most.

178
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,160
Right.

179
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,560
I've earned her a conferred title.

180
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,760
No.

181
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,680
You being able to peacefully and safely grow up

182
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,950
is the thing that she would

183
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:11,720
have wanted to do the most.

184
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,640
You are right.

185
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,600
Actually, what my maternal grandfather wanted

186
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,000
was just my mother's safety.

187
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,480
And what my mother wanted

188
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,800
was me growing up safely.

189
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,800
Before my Little Mother died,

190
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,560
she forced me to go to my grandmother.

191
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,200
She also had the same wish.

192
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,000
For so many years, I lived a honest live

193
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,440
and was cautious with my words.

194
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,080
It was also to fulfill her wish.

195
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,400
I remember that day

196
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,320
when you were running

197
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,000
in the streets of Yangzhou

198
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,960
and you told me that your mother is dying.

199
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,360
I saw your hands and face full of blood.

200
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,960
I then remembered that

201
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,600
my mother

202
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,640
also died

203
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,600
when she gave birth to a child.

204
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,320
That time, I can see myself

205
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,880
when I look at you.

206
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,360
That's why, you brought me to a clinic

207
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,560
to look for a doctor.

208
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,920
You even blocked off Lin Qinshuang for me.

209
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,400
I feel grateful to you for that.

210
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,160
You used to call her mother before.

211
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,400
How come you call her Little Mother now?

212
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,160
She wouldn't let me call her mother.

213
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,960
She said that's overstepping her status.

214
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,760
But in my heart,

215
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,520
she's my mother.

216
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,440
Before she died,

217
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,320
she forced me to change my address to her.

218
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,680
She said that only by doing that

219
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,240
can I continue to survive in the Sheng Family.

220
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,040
Move the memorial table of mother-in-law

221
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,080
to the main hall

222
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,080
of Yuqing Monastery.

223
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,480
You called her mother-in-law?

224
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,680
She's your respected and precious mother.

225
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,400
Of course, I must call her mother-in-law.

226
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,800
From now on, don't be afraid of anything.

227
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,480
You can call her mother as you want.

228
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,050
Now that Sixth Sister was able

229
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,000
to marry a Marquis Gu

230
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,360
and obtain a conferred title,

231
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,880
she has become so overbearing and arrogant.

232
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,240
I repeatedly begged her but she just won't agree.

233
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,720
My pitiful Little Mother...

234
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,520
She can't even have a memorial tablet...

235
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,400
Eat.

236
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,160
It was quite a pity that

237
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,240
you were unable to eat much earlier.

238
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,320
Eat more then.

239
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,920
Husband, don't be mad too.

240
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,760
That Marquis Gu is now a highly favored official.

241
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,275
Of course, he's

242
00:11:36,275 --> 00:11:37,360
being domineering and arrogant.

243
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,480
Presently,

244
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,800
we can only swallow this anger.

245
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,800
You're be an official sooner or later.

246
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,520
You just need to work harder

247
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,640
and rank in the imperial examination.

248
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,520
A scholarly official is like a clear stream.

249
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,160
It is way better than that of Gu Tingye's.

250
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,100
We'll just seek vengeance

251
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,000
for these grudges by then.

252
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,280
Shut up!

253
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,400
Let me ask you,

254
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,640
is our meeting in Yuqing Monastery

255
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,920
really just a chance encounter as you claimed,

256
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,960
or you schemed for it?

257
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,720
This was arranged by the heaven,

258
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,000
a marriage fate from our past life.

259
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,475
Give me the answer

260
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:22,600
after thinking about it clearly.

261
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,840
It's really just a chance encounter.

262
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,680
Since I saw you in Jinming Pond, my heart...

263
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,440
I...

264
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,240
If you don't want to tell the truth,

265
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,120
I'll then personally

266
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,040
ask your Sixth Little Sister.

267
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,480
She has long been envious of my talent.

268
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,280
And now, she has obtained a high status.

269
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,120
Of course, she wants to sow dissension between us.

270
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,750
Why won't you believe me

271
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,880
and insist on believing her?!

272
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,480
I also don't trust her.

273
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,440
I will confront her

274
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,120
in front of your parents.

275
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,880
We'll be face to face to check.

276
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,800
One will eventually tell the truth.

277
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,075
There are so many stories of how harem members

278
00:13:12,075 --> 00:13:12,600
compete for their husband's favor

279
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,480
especially among wealthy families.

280
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,800
But at most,

281
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,120
they would only get driven out of the house.

282
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,160
It's still my first time hearing

283
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,240
someone getting killed for it.

284
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,240
How vicious are

285
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,880
you and your mother?

286
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,080
I indeed deliberately went to Yuqing Monastery

287
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,320
so I can see you,

288
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,480
but that was also because I love you

289
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,320
and just yearning to see you.

290
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,200
Since little, as an illegitimate daughter

291
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,640
in the Sheng family,

292
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,240
I lacked food and clothing,

293
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,440
and lived an unbearably hard life.

294
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,650
I can only read some poetry books to have

295
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:50,480
somthing to express my talent and emotions on.

296
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,000
I thought that after meeting you,

297
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,360
meeting a good man,

298
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,680
I can escape and fly to the sky.

299
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,280
Never thought...

300
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,600
You actually would believe

301
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,840
the crazy words of those people

302
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,440
and slander me and my mother.

303
00:14:06,673 --> 00:14:07,529
If I've known...

304
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,400
If I've known,

305
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,200
I would have chosen to rot and die

306
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:14,760
inside the Sheng Manor.

307
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,800
I wouldn't need to

308
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,920
be this hurt right now.

309
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,920
Husband, think about it!

310
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,280
If my mother

311
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,680
is that sinister,

312
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,920
how could she died alone from sickness

313
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,040
in such pitiful manner,

314
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,720
and not even have a memorial tablet of her own?

315
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,960
Really?

316
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,960
Not true.

317
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,840
You just believe whoever you want.

318
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,040
Marquis, Big Madam,

319
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,320
your paternal-line aunt is here.

320
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,050
She's currently enjoying tea

321
00:14:59,050 --> 00:14:59,760
in the side receiving hall.

322
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,560
I'm wearing an official uniform,

323
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,600
so it's not right to meet my elder.

324
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,120
I'll go once I've changed my clothes.

325
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,840
Then I'll go there now.

326
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,280
Okay.

327
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,360
There's still a lady

328
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,600
by her side.

329
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,440
She doesn't look like a maidservant,

330
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,160
nor a relative of hers.

331
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,080
Then...

332
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:18,975
is she trying to give her to us

333
00:15:18,975 --> 00:15:19,800
to be a concubine of the marquis?

334
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,000
Xiaotao.

335
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,960
Did Aunt come alone

336
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,800
or there are two of them?

337
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,240
After leaving Xuanning Hall,

338
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,120
she came here by herself.

339
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,520
That Grand Madam Qin

340
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,520
wants to disturb the peace of our house

341
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,040
without even entering it.

342
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,960
Big Madam, don't worry.

343
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,040
Regardless of what matter it is,

344
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,640
Marquis will defend you.

345
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,240
That's right.

346
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,400
Marquis treats me so well.

347
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,160
Always thinking for my sake.

348
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,480
The more I must

349
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,800
lessen his troubles.

350
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,625
As they say, a man marrying,

351
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:54,400
a woman getting married off,

352
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,560
giving birth and raise kids,

353
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,240
are the greatest order of human relationship.

354
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,320
Based on your background and status,

355
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,675
for you to be able to enter the marquis family

356
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,395
is already great fortune.

357
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,280
But you've already been married for a year.

358
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
How come there's still

359
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,280
no news about your womb?

360
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,480
I'm guessing that

361
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,320
it's still not my fate to have one.

362
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,120
Before, Second still had a son

363
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,400
from his outside mistress.

364
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,320
Now, he's also gone.

365
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,880
He's now just a name placed

366
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,320
in the genealogy book.

367
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,575
Seeing how our main house only

368
00:16:27,575 --> 00:16:28,480
have a few male descendants,

369
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,720
it's really upsetting.

370
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,880
Since you are so busy and inconvenient,

371
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,080
I found you a person

372
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,240
to place into your house.

373
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:35,920
Fengxian!

374
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,520
Come up and meet the madam.

375
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,880
Greetings, Madam.

376
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,800
This is...

377
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,985
She's a daughter of a farmer in our farmstead.

378
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,520
She knows best to sew clothes and cook,

379
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,120
and can make a great soup.

380
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,320
Place her inside your house

381
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,650
and she can cook soup for Second

382
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:56,520
to nourish his health.

383
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,800
Young Lord,

384
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,920
a maidservant told me

385
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,120
that she saw your aunt bringing

386
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,480
a young lady with her.

387
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,325
That woman seems new here,

388
00:17:16,325 --> 00:17:17,040
for she hasn't seen her before.

389
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,480
What does the lady look like?

390
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,680
She looks quite pretty.

391
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,920
Go wash the official clothes of marquis.

392
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,920
Greetings, Marquis.

393
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,527
This is...

394
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,040
This is a lady

395
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,040
gifted by aunt.

396
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,080
Her surname is Qian, name Fengxian.

397
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,040
Earlier,

398
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,560
Mistress Qian has already

399
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,040
served Big Madam tea.

400
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,360
She agreed?!

401
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,800
Madam Aunt openly told Big Madam that

402
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,400
she couldn't have any child.

403
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,800
And she even said that

404
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,200
Big Madam has sent all the people

405
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,160
by your side away.

406
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,160
If she doesn't accept this now,

407
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,560
that's being a jealous wife.

408
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,520
Did she agree right away,

409
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,560
or agreed after

410
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,000
Aunt was talking midway?

411
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,240
Since Madam Aunt already said it,

412
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,880
Big Madam can only agree.

413
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,120
She agreed to it quite rapidly.

414
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,040
After hearing about it,

415
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,500
I rushed here,

416
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,600
but still didn't catch her tea time.

417
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,600
Big Madam is only thinking for your sake.

418
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,000
My house doesn't lack this tea.

419
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,440
Marquis, please don't be mad.

420
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,720
Since Big Madam has agreed,

421
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,360
arrange her to stay in Shuixian Pavilion!

422
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,520
If it was others, I won't be this persistent.

423
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,325
But this Fengxian has a body

424
00:18:59,325 --> 00:19:00,520
very suitable for childbirth.

425
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,840
I spent a lot of effort to find her.

426
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,840
If she can bear Second

427
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,480
a son or a daughter,

428
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,320
I then did not disappoint my older brother,

429
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,320
did not disappoint that

430
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,240
iron book in the ancestral hall.

431
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,920
This is all an honor for Aunt.

432
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,600
No matter if this Miss Fengxian

433
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,280
has a son or a daughter,

434
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,760
Marquis and I will treat her very generously.

435
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,600
I'm almost leaving.

436
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,840
Second, you're finally back.

437
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,680
On my way here,

438
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,760
I bumped into Cuiwei.

439
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,760
You have then seen Miss Fengxian already.

440
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,080
You already are calling her Fengxian?

441
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,200
So intimate.

442
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,480
I've already settled her

443
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,000
in Shuixian Pavilion.

444
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,760
Shuixian Pavilion?

445
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,920
That's a good courtyard.

446
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,240
It's very near the main room and study.

447
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,680
If marquis needs someone to attend to him,

448
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,880
it would be very convenient and faster.

449
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,880
Your mother-in-law

450
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,920
was right.

451
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,600
This wife of yours

452
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,040
is indeed an able mistress.

453
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,280
Aunt, did you come here

454
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,240
to give me a gift?

455
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,960
Of course.

456
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,920
My deceased father had my older brother

457
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,440
just after ten years of marriage.

458
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,080
My older brother was married for 15 years

459
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,200
before he had Xian'er.

460
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,400
Aunt didn't give them gifts,

461
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,320
but instead give me,

462
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,600
a newlywed, a gift?

463
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,000
Your older brother was sickly.

464
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,480
Your father in the past was so busy

465
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,240
for the sake of the Gu Family,

466
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,880
hence, unable to care about these matters.

467
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,240
When you got married,

468
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,160
as the eldest daughter-in-law,

469
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,760
your days in your husband's home wasn't good.

470
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,975
If your maiden house was a capable one,

471
00:21:02,975 --> 00:21:03,760
it would have been better.

472
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,680
But that time,

473
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,050
the Gu Family had a huge fund deficit,

474
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:07,920
and almost got imprisoned.

475
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,760
Enough.

476
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,280
Why you mention those past matters?

477
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,800
Out of urgency,

478
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,120
you had to look for a salt merchant,

479
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:16,750
a family that's not at all compatible

480
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,240
with them in terms of status,

481
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,960
and developed a marriage alliance with them.

482
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,960
People then laughed so hard.

483
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,680
I'm afraid that Aunt's days in your husband's home

484
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,640
must have gotten worse.

485
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,440
I'm afraid that during those days,

486
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,360
when the meals at your home was a bit bland,

487
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,375
they had to ask you to return to your

488
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:30,280
maiden family to get some salt, right?

489
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,040
How come you know all about these?

490
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:36,975
When you see so much of

491
00:21:36,975 --> 00:21:38,080
these internal house matters,

492
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,440
you're able to

493
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,520
guess the rest.

494
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,480
Aunt,

495
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,200
you vented all your grudges and hatred

496
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,520
on my mother.

497
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,520
When my mother died,

498
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,240
you then vented them on me.

499
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:53,925
Don't think that

500
00:21:53,925 --> 00:21:54,960
I've forgotten about all these.

501
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,080
OKay.

502
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,240
Since you've said things to this point,

503
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,760
I will then be frank with you.

504
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,640
From the start,

505
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,720
I deemed your mother incompatible

506
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,480
to be a wife of our Gu family.

507
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,360
Now, you are now successful in your career.

508
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,960
I indeed was harsh on you before.

509
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,375
Currently, I also don't want

510
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:18,160
to bask in your glory.

511
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,960
But you're now the master of the Gu Clan.

512
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,840
You should bear this burden.

513
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,920
The Fourth and Fifth Houses faced trouble.

514
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,400
Bing'er also got exiled.

515
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,880
You should quickly merge the houses

516
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,250
and provide for your widowed mother

517
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,000
and auntie-in-laws.

518
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,000
That madam.

519
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,280
It takes her a month to select a mason.

520
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,600
Dragging on day by day like this

521
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,040
and what can we do?

522
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,800
I'm afraid you heard

523
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,000
my stepmother talk.

524
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,360
And you came charging with full anger

525
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,720
to shove a concubine

526
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,400
to disgust Minglan.

527
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,278
Without your inciting,

528
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,760
one born by a concubine,

529
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,960
how would she dare?

530
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,680
The houses haven't joined yet,

531
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,800
and she already sent someone

532
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,840
to stab me.

533
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,280
If we combined the houses,

534
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,520
will I still have a life left?

535
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,120
You can't blame Minglan on this, Aunt.

536
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,520
You must want to condemn her.

537
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,840
She's the big Qin Madam.

538
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,240
What would she gain by killing you?

539
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,040
Of course it's the great benefit of

540
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,160
having her son inherit the nobility title.

541
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,840
Aunt, you are upright.

542
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,240
You trust her without any doubts.

543
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,840
But

544
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,720
have you really never suspected

545
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,800
she might do harm to me?

546
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,408
She does harms to you?

547
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,600
How's that possible?

548
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,800
Aunt.

549
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,720
Since I was little,

550
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,080
have I really been that mischievous?

551
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,160
Every time I caused trouble,

552
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,075
she would always protect me

553
00:23:49,075 --> 00:23:49,920
and speak to my benefit.

554
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,680
But my father would only

555
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,160
beat me more harshly.

556
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,360
How can that be?

557
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,880
Second brother,

558
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,880
I know you are proud and fierce.

559
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,240
Your stepmother did indeed

560
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,640
go overboard in her conduct.

561
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,800
But all these years,

562
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,960
it's not easy for her

563
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,960
to manage the whole family.

564
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,240
On the account of

565
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,560
your own father,

566
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,960
raise up your hand to her.

567
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,480
If she stops playing more tricks

568
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,560
and ends here,

569
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,080
of course I won't fight

570
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,080
with her till the end.

571
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,160
Aunt.

572
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,760
You help me persuade her too.

573
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,440
Have her let go.

574
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,720
Don't grab onto the grievances anymore.

575
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,600
Or else once our manors are joined,

576
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,160
we won't have any good days

577
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,800
and she won't be much better.

578
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,000
She

579
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,520
and your bride's maiden aunt

580
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,480
are getting along so well now.

581
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,160
I'm afraid she won't

582
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,080
listen to my words.

583
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,560
The young couple

584
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,080
kept the person?

585
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,480
They took her in.

586
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,960
I followed the aunt

587
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,920
and saw her stand outside for a long time.

588
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,640
Fengxian wasn't with her.

589
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,440
Then they really kept her.

590
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,560
Big Madam, you don't have to worry about that.

591
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,760
At any rate, it's a good thing.

592
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,080
I had thought

593
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,800
they wouldn't take her.

594
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,000
We just wanted to see the aunt

595
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,440
and second young master fight

596
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,400
and drive apart from each other.

597
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,280
That way you can

598
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,640
be closer to the aunt.

599
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,880
Now it seems

600
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,080
they've kept that concubine.

601
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,409
And we now have an extra pair of eyes

602
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,880
in Cheng Garden.

603
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,040
The benefits don't stop there.

604
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,600
Second son took in the person.

605
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,640
And that Sheng miss

606
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,360
isn't a woman

607
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,200
that is willing to share her bed with others.

608
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,040
The newlyweds

609
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,400
have a lot to fight.

610
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,160
As long as they fight,

611
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,760
they are not made of steel.

612
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,640
If it's not made of steel,

613
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,160
you can poke them open,

614
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,360
and puncture them to pieces.

615
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:50,611
Count Manor

616
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,400
What are you looking at so intently?

617
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,040
Is someone outside?

618
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,800
No.

619
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,200
Just a letter from my home.

620
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,560
Your family wants you home

621
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,080
because they got someone for you to marry.

622
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,880
And they want you to beg my understanding?

623
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,520
So ignorant.

624
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,600
Being a maidservant in this count manor

625
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,880
is better than being a miss

626
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,080
at an affluent manor outside.

627
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,360
But I am

628
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,440
isn't young anymore.

629
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,680
Back at Sheng house,

630
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,575
Mistress Lin said she would release me

631
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:38,880
in half a year

632
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,600
to go home and marry.

633
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,360
But I've followed you to the count manor

634
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,920
for almost two years now.

635
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,120
I really can't afford to wait more.

636
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,000
You're my accompanying maid

637
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,440
and we came from Sheng manor together.

638
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,440
Without my approval,

639
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,440
who dares to let you go?

640
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,480
You...

641
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,680
If you're docile

642
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,120
and agreeable to me,

643
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,200
I will find a scholar family for you,

644
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,720
that's a hundred times better

645
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,680
than going now to marry at home.

646
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:15,600
Find my husband to come see me.

647
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,480
Tell him I'm sick.

648
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,840
My head's aching severely.

649
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:37,900
Young Master.

650
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,240
Fourth Miss is suffering from severe headache.

651
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,280
She can't get out of bed.

652
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,920
She needs a doctor.

653
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,560
If she wants a doctor, let her summon one.

654
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,320
Perhaps you can take a look.

655
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,000
She's having a severe headache.

656
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,080
Young Master,

657
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:20,920
what are you doing?

658
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,080
You don't need to scare.

659
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,440
I have something to ask you.

660
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,360
I remember my wife,

661
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,960
back at the Sheng Family,

662
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,240
she had two close maidservants.

663
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,160
One's called Luzong.

664
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,760
The other's called Yunzai.

665
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,480
They grew up

666
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,280
together with her.

667
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,320
But when she married,

668
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,880
why didn't she

669
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,760
bring those two?

670
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,000
But brought you and Furong instead?

671
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,520
I don't know either.

672
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,960
It's all arranged

673
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,600
by the big madam at home.

674
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,680
If you tell me,

675
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,440
I will dote on you from now on.

676
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,480
If you don't tell me,

677
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,440
you won't have any good result.

678
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,760
My wife won't

679
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,880
release you.

680
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,400
So what great ending

681
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,800
will you get by going now?

682
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,720
Be with me instead.

683
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,520
Can't say very wealthy,

684
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,680
at least for stability.

685
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,000
Tell me.

686
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,000
Where did those two go?

687
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,840
I heard,

688
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,320
I heard they were beaten to death.

689
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,800
Why?

690
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,560
They said they

691
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,160
colluded with Mistress Lin.

692
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,040
And let Fourth Miss sneak out to meet you.

693
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,360
And they even made raw rice into cooked rice

694
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,920
by spreading the words out.

695
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:15,660
Cheng Garden

696
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,960
Where's my wife?

697
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,560
Marquis,

698
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,640
she went to Shuixian Pavilion

699
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,080
to settle Mistress Qian.

700
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,080
She's not resting so late at night.

701
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,400
What's there to settle?

702
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,169
Marquis is unaware

703
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,920
that Mistress Qian only has

704
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,040
one maidservant and one bag.

705
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,040
Big Madam has to go

706
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,240
and arrange for

707
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,160
every other needs.

708
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,600
She's so ardent.

709
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,440
Marquis.

710
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,640
Marquis is mad.

711
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,055
Mad?

712
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,320
Why is he mad?

713
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,840
Do I still have to make the bed for the marquis then?

714
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,680
Silly Miss.

715
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,840
Have you ever seen him

716
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,920
not sleeping here?

717
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:17,960
Shitou.

718
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,400
That marquis

719
00:32:23,411 --> 00:32:24,440
is so temperamental.

720
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:35,450
Shuixian Pavilion

721
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,000
Add another maidservant.

722
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,040
Add three for miscellaneous and kitchen.

723
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,200
I wondered where everyone went

724
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,560
and here's everyone.

725
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,160
Greetings, Marquis.

726
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,520
You're here, Marquis.

727
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,720
Do you find anything

728
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,720
lacking in here?

729
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,920
I will have Cuiwei write it down

730
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,960
and get it tomorrow.

731
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,200
How will we know

732
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,560
what's lacking so quickly?

733
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:05,840
She'll need to stay here tonight.

734
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,560
Use a lot and see a lot

735
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,880
before I can report to you.

736
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,560
If everything's arranged,

737
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,120
we can go back

738
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,600
without worrying.

739
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,752
The major things are done

740
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,360
and whatever lacks

741
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,760
are just minor.

742
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,120
Marquis, you can stay and help her look around.

743
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,280
Tonight can be considered you and Mistress Qian's

744
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,480
wedding night.

745
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,140
Shuixian Pavilion

746
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Marquis, it's almost the third watch .

747
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,600
Rest up.

748
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,400
Shitou.

749
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,400
It's already the third watch.

750
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,040
Why didn't I hear anyone make the watch strike?

751
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,920
No word from the main house yet.

752
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,760
Who asked you that?

753
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,880
Then, I didn't hear

754
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,080
the watch strike either.

755
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,960
And no words from the main house either.

756
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,160
Big Madam, I hear at home,

757
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,160
the third young master's room,

758
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,560
has another person added.

759
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,325
What does third brother's matters

760
00:35:44,325 --> 00:35:45,120
have anything to do with me?

761
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,920
I heard it was the third young mistress

762
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,280
that put her in.

763
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,040
Saying she herself isn't available.

764
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,480
Last time, I saw her

765
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,720
and she looked healthy still.

766
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,600
She's gotten ill already?

767
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,240
I'm not done soaking.

768
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,520
She's not ill.

769
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,800
She's pregnant?

770
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,600
Danju.

771
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,240
Is there something you wanted to tell me?

772
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,040
Miss.

773
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,400
I just find that

774
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,480
third young mistress doing so,

775
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,960
is because she had no choice either.

776
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,240
But you don't

777
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,320
have news yet,

778
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,840
so why are you arranging someone

779
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,720
for the marquis already?

780
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,120
There's three types of concubines.

781
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,680
Recruited from outside.

782
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,160
Gifted by someone.

783
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,040
Or raised at home.

784
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,120
My father-in-law's sister shoved her to me

785
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,960
to my face.

786
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,075
If I were to reject her

787
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,915
and take on the reputation of easily jealous,

788
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,840
then it becomes a fight

789
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,200
between the marquis and the aunt.

790
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,080
Marquis is always

791
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,800
being so sweet to me.

792
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,700
And now he has to shoulder so much

793
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,640
stress from the royal court,

794
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,400
so why bother him with these matters?

795
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,240
That's true.

796
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,720
But,

797
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,520
if you become pregnant

798
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,520
later on,

799
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,560
then you'll have to take in another again.

800
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,640
I know you're not delighted.

801
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,840
But if that time comes,

802
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,160
instead of finding some

803
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,720
whose roots we don't know,

804
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:54,880
you should let

805
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,120
our own go instead.

806
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,440
I checked all this time,

807
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,240
those in our courtyard are all good.

808
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,040
Xiaotao is steady

809
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,160
and Sister Cuiwei manages the whole yard.

810
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,280
She's also steady.

811
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,840
If the servants have that intention,

812
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,160
of willing to serve the marquis,

813
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I think it's good.

814
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,760
Or else,

815
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,280
I'd be using them

816
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,200
as commodities

817
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,920
and I can't do that.

818
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,040
Perhaps,

819
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,360
I lack tolerance.

820
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,880
But I really can't put myself to

821
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,600
really treat a concubine as my own sister.

822
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,960
What do you mean, Miss?

823
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,360
No one treats a concubine

824
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,320
as their own sister.

825
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,520
But...

826
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,120
If you were to

827
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,280
get pregnant for real,

828
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,000
who will you have to go serve the marquis?

829
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,760
I can't force

830
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,120
where the marquis places his heart.

831
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,880
If he holds another in his heart,

832
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,000
without my arranging,

833
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,920
he can also find one by himself.

834
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,560
Then what if the time comes

835
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,360
and the marquis really wants someone?

836
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,040
Then,

837
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,840
we will need to

838
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,040
guard our own hearts tightly.

839
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,120
Marquis, I will fetch water for you

840
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,080
to wash and rest up.

841
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,280
Why are you still here?

842
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,960
I've been here all along.

843
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,000
It's my fault.

844
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:50,920
It's dark

845
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,920
and I'll leave now.

846
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,360
May Marquis enjoy a beautiful night,

847
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,440
with lots of children and blessings to come.

848
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,720
Shitou.

849
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,120
It's the third watch?

850
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,080
It's half past third watch.

851
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,720
I went to go take a look.

852
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,200
The main house already blew out the light.

853
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,160
What?

854
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:22,760
Then? Then,

855
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,800
did they say anything?

856
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,480
I don't know.

857
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,120
How don't you know?

858
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,240
Have that dummy,

859
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,280
Xiaotao go find out.

860
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,560
She's not a dummy.

861
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,960
Then did you find out?

862
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,080
They've already blew out their light.

863
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,000
It's not convenient for me to go.

864
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,120
Go!

865
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,640
Right away.

866
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,200
Marquis still hasn't gone to bed?

867
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,280
There's no word from inside the room though.

868
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,360
My Big Madam

869
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,200
is very well.

870
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,320
She and I had honey cakes together

871
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,760
before she went to bed.

872
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,720
Is it good?

873
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,960
So good!

874
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,560
The chefs in our house

875
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,200
make them much better than outside.

876
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,520
But the fried cherries.

877
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,000
Ours isn't as good as the one from Nanbei Shop.

878
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,560
Tomorrow I'll go to the streets, to Nanbei Shop.

879
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,920
And I'll fetch some for you to eat.

880
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,320
Eat, eat, eat.

881
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,400
How do those two even look like

882
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,360
mistress and servant?

883
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,000
They are like sisters!

884
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,400
Other than eating all day,

885
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,320
what else do they know?

886
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,120
What are you doing, Marquis?

887
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,840
She can blow out the candle to sleep

888
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,760
and so can I!

889
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,720
Blow out the light.

890
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:16,160
Marquis. Are we going back?

891
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,280
The Ox Hour is over?

892
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,720
The clapper just went off.

893
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,960
Looks like if I don't go back,

894
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,480
she won't come and ask about me.
