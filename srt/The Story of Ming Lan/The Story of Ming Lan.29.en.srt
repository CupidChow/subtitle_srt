00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,842
Episode 29

3
00:01:17,584 --> 00:01:18,904
You're finally here!

4
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:22,459
We heard you are coming,

5
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:23,226
and our entire family's

6
00:01:23,226 --> 00:01:24,980
been full of glee!

7
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:25,723
The Old Madam ate

8
00:01:25,723 --> 00:01:27,449
an extra half-bowl of rice yesterday!

9
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,370
That means she really missed me!

10
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,050
If it hadn't been for

11
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,116
Hong'er's mother's illness

12
00:01:34,116 --> 00:01:36,620
dragging over a month to recover,

13
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,530
I would have come a long time ago!

14
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,235
Old Madam's been waiting for us

15
00:01:40,235 --> 00:01:41,190
for a long time. Let's go in!

16
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,910
Hurry now. Hurry and let me greet her!

17
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,120
Try this cup of tea now.

18
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,460
Great tea.

19
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,510
We've been here for half the day already.

20
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:11,080
Why don't we see your little granddaughter?

21
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,920
Is she not at home?

22
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,650
She's sick.

23
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,630
What's the illness?

24
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,260
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

25
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,530
So I could go take a look?

26
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,430
Nothing too serious,

27
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,880
just some headache and light fever.

28
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,620
Your Hong'er can deal with it.

29
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,640
You sly lady!

30
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:41,406
Miss,

31
00:02:41,615 --> 00:02:43,265
the sister from Old Madam's room

32
00:02:43,265 --> 00:02:44,105
sent a message.

33
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,171
It says that the Young Master of the He House

34
00:02:45,171 --> 00:02:46,818
is waiting for you at Shouan Hall,

35
00:02:46,818 --> 00:02:48,439
and he won't leave.

36
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,760
Didn't I tell you what to tell them,

37
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,120
Tell them I'm sick and asleep.

38
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,040
I already did, and he left.

39
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,190
But not long after, he came back again.

40
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,147
He said he told the kitchen to make fish stew

41
00:02:59,147 --> 00:03:01,700
for you to eat.

42
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,128
What a weird man!

43
00:03:04,128 --> 00:03:05,551
What time is it now?

44
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,919
The fish market must have closed long ago.

45
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,067
How can he make fish stew?

46
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,704
He said he brought the fish from Youyang.

47
00:03:12,704 --> 00:03:14,064
Your favorite, Miss.

48
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,770
This really is fresh fish from Youyang's river?

49
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,240
How is it available in Bianjing?

50
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,520
I remember back in Youyang that

51
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,860
you love to eat fish soup.

52
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,898
When I found out I would accompany Grandmother

53
00:03:47,898 --> 00:03:49,244
to the capital to visit you,

54
00:03:49,244 --> 00:03:51,284
I went to Youyang to fish a few.

55
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:52,775
I put them in a big crock

56
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:53,510
to put in the carriage,

57
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,430
and I added some

58
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,660
clean water every day.

59
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,781
When we arrived,

60
00:03:57,781 --> 00:03:59,307
two were still alive.

61
00:03:59,307 --> 00:04:01,007
I heard you were sick.

62
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,940
So I hurried and made fish soup

63
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,540
to bring to you, so you can warm your stomach.

64
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,910
Why did you bother yourself?

65
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,430
Nobody in the world

66
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,750
will not get sick.

67
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:15,010
Just a slight fever, and no need to worry about.

68
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:16,578
You ate your heart out,

69
00:04:16,578 --> 00:04:18,440
and harmed your state of mind.

70
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,680
You need good restoration.

71
00:04:20,085 --> 00:04:21,085
After you're well,

72
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,440
the flowers will be blooming everywhere,

73
00:04:22,448 --> 00:04:24,800
and you can leave the house to pray to the gods.

74
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,208
Having an outing in the great scenery out in the open plain,

75
00:04:28,544 --> 00:04:30,064
and your heart and soul will naturally be nourished.

76
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,420
You need to eat this soup while it's hot.

77
00:04:32,727 --> 00:04:34,790
I went through such trouble to fish them.

78
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,924
It was so cold by the river at night.

79
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:38,930
If you don't eat it all,

80
00:04:39,538 --> 00:04:41,781
you owe me for my suffering a chill.

81
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,210
Actually, I didn't suffer any chill.

82
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,115
These fish, actually I bought them

83
00:04:50,115 --> 00:04:52,140
from the fishermen by the river.

84
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,760
I didn't go through much trouble.

85
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,620
There you go.

86
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,150
Smile a bit.

87
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,825
Clear your mind and release toxins

88
00:05:04,825 --> 00:05:05,470
and live a long life.

89
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,240
Don't make tea right now.

90
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,680
What's going on?

91
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,769
You need to let me know

92
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:47,488
so I can be at ease!

93
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,227
Aunt does not need to be at ease.

94
00:05:50,227 --> 00:05:51,866
I need to be at ease.

95
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,550
You need to be at ease.

96
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,230
Then you can just

97
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,060
go to your home to make tea.

98
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,870
You come to my place to make tea for whom?

99
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,760
I can't be at ease at home.

100
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,432
I can only be at ease

101
00:06:09,432 --> 00:06:10,416
making tea with you.

102
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,550
The first cup spilled to the ground,

103
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,440
to honor my mother.

104
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,590
Second cup, may Auntie enjoy.

105
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,470
Third cup, I enjoy it.

106
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,147
We're done praying to God.

107
00:07:30,147 --> 00:07:30,828
Time to go home.

108
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,740
Go home?

109
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,249
Then

110
00:07:36,249 --> 00:07:39,250
What about your mother's matter?

111
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,890
You said you tried to tell your father

112
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:41,954
and it might work out,

113
00:07:41,954 --> 00:07:42,994
so I should be at ease.

114
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,490
Now you come drink tea and leave.

115
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,250
How can I be at ease?

116
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,930
You made this trip

117
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,667
just to make tea and drink,

118
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:53,290
and then go home?

119
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,950
Yes. I came to the monastery,

120
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,330
and now I'm going home.

121
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,840
Why do you bother walking, Big Madam?

122
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,277
We can have the carriage driver bring the carriage

123
00:08:03,277 --> 00:08:05,154
in all the way to the mountain gate

124
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,620
and you will be spared some travel.

125
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,770
You know nothing.

126
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:08,530
Using your own feet,

127
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,010
climbing up step by step.

128
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,580
That shows more sincerity!

129
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,400
Sheng House's Sixth Miss!

130
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,590
Greetings, Big Madam Wu of the Liang House!

131
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,350
Greetings!

132
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,790
We are so fated!

133
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,320
I always run into you.

134
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,590
I think that the gods and spirits watch over it!

135
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,352
What a joy.

136
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,420
How is your health lately, Big Madam?

137
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,920
Great.

138
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,405
Look.

139
00:08:32,405 --> 00:08:33,882
The weather's getting warmer.

140
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:36,000
By Jinming Pond, the grass is green

141
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,890
and the flowers have bloomed.

142
00:08:37,085 --> 00:08:38,685
And you play such great jiju

143
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,347
so you must come and help!

144
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,310
I don't feel so well lately.

145
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,773
I'm afraid I can't play jiju.

146
00:08:47,191 --> 00:08:49,421
I don't want to ruin your great record,

147
00:08:49,421 --> 00:08:50,381
so I won't go.

148
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,940
What's wrong? Not feeling well?

149
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,460
I have great wild ginseng

150
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,980
and when I return home,

151
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,800
I'll have it delivered to your room

152
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,610
so you can restore your vitality.

153
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,670
Don't bother.

154
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,356
It's just, it's just a cold.

155
00:09:02,356 --> 00:09:04,461
Thank you for your concern, Big Madam.

156
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,769
A cold will be gone in few days.

157
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,710
I'll wait until you're recovered

158
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,910
and hold the jiju match.

159
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,625
We're not in a rush over a few days.

160
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,390
There are words

161
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:18,554
that you're not telling me.

162
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,097
This isn't

163
00:09:20,097 --> 00:09:21,617
the conduct of our great child.

164
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,770
I went once in previous year

165
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,690
because I played jiju for Sister Yanran.

166
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,602
Afterward, I caused quite a stir out of it

167
00:09:32,151 --> 00:09:33,697
and I've reflected upon myself.

168
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,200
I think the troubles came

169
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,750
from my showing off,

170
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,430
so now I've cultivated

171
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,580
my temperament to be more calm.

172
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,845
I shouldn't play jiju anymore,

173
00:09:42,845 --> 00:09:44,805
just stay at home and write.

174
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,590
Those idle talkers and gossips?

175
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,800
You should treat them

176
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,740
like bullshit!

177
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,725
Why are you taking them in

178
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:53,860
and caring about them?

179
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,250
Sister Rulan and Molan.

180
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,259
They are not that interested in jiju,

181
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:00,246
so it's not proper for me to go either.

182
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,670
It might stir some talk

183
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,510
that you hold me in high regard, Countess.

184
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,850
I do hold you in high regard!

185
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:06,530
So?

186
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,247
Let them talk idly!

187
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,650
Big Madam, I think we should forget it.

188
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,760
I understand.

189
00:10:17,948 --> 00:10:20,000
You're all alone in the courtyard

190
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
and it's not easy.

191
00:10:21,334 --> 00:10:22,454
Fine then.

192
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,707
I wanted you to play jiju with me,

193
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,160
but I will not put you in any difficulty.

194
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,263
I'll send an invitation to your home tomorrow

195
00:10:28,263 --> 00:10:31,325
to invite all the sisters.

196
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,140
I wonder if that Countess

197
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,520
is fond of our daughter.

198
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,393
Why is she sending an invitation here

199
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,833
each time there's an event?

200
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,239
A jiju match,

201
00:10:48,239 --> 00:10:50,410
and such a formal invitation!

202
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,802
It does seem to be so.

203
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,270
Lately,

204
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,100
the Countess comes to the manor often

205
00:10:56,671 --> 00:10:57,671
and we didn't see her coming here

206
00:10:57,671 --> 00:10:58,711
so frequently before.

207
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,230
That's why

208
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,360
she came a few days ago

209
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:09,170
and it seemed like casual talk,

210
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,490
but in reality she wanted to reveal to us

211
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,090
about Qi House and Prince Yong's matter.

212
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,240
In fact

213
00:11:16,648 --> 00:11:18,295
she's implying me.

214
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,720
Telling me not to put my hopes up with Qi House,

215
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,700
the best option

216
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,060
is to be in-laws with her instead.

217
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,510
The invitation says

218
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:30,381
to have all three Misses come.

219
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,050
I just don't know

220
00:11:32,663 --> 00:11:34,463
which Miss she's fond of.

221
00:11:34,463 --> 00:11:36,258
Of course.

222
00:11:36,258 --> 00:11:38,870
It must be my Rulan!

223
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,782
Allow me to say a word

224
00:11:40,782 --> 00:11:42,223
without courting your anger.

225
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,900
From what I have seen these days,

226
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,926
the Countess seems

227
00:11:46,926 --> 00:11:47,966
closer to Sixth Miss.

228
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,640
Close is just being close.

229
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,875
Minglan is just decent at jiju

230
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:57,995
and that pleases her.

231
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,110
But when it comes to marriage,

232
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,310
that's different.

233
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,160
It's like you

234
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,120
raise a cat or dog.

235
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:08,171
You are so pleased with it,

236
00:12:08,171 --> 00:12:09,051
but it's not like you're going to marry

237
00:12:09,051 --> 00:12:09,731
that cat or dog

238
00:12:09,731 --> 00:12:11,131
to your own son.

239
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,750
Mother.

240
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,310
I don't want to go attend that jiju match.

241
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,580
So much dust at the place

242
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,500
and it's suffocating.

243
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:23,930
Each time I go,

244
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,441
I'm covered with mud all over.

245
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,550
I'm definitely not going.

246
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,210
Silly.

247
00:12:29,638 --> 00:12:31,078
What did I tell you?

248
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,030
Sixth Young Master Liang is interested in you

249
00:12:33,364 --> 00:12:35,284
and that's a God given chance.

250
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,090
But Big Madam is there.

251
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:38,632
She won't approve of

252
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,152
Sixth Young Master Liang and I being close.

253
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,630
As long as you're more daring

254
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:44,890
and do things more furtively...

255
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,444
Last time at the Gu House,

256
00:12:47,444 --> 00:12:48,450
you and Young Master Liang

257
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:49,810
made poetry too.

258
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,620
That Liang boy thinks

259
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,220
I look like a heavenly fairy.

260
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:58,070
But that Big Madam Wu...

261
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,440
If you keep stewing over those things,

262
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,960
you can't stand out.

263
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,330
Back then I

264
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,250
made up my mind firmly too.

265
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:06,950
I knew clearly that

266
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,090
your father is softhearted

267
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:08,930
and easily manipulated.

268
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,190
That's how I fought for what we have today.

269
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,800
And you were born

270
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,200
as the daughter of an official's house.

271
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,920
So you ought to step out the door as a Sheng,

272
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,720
and go higher!

273
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,450
The Countess doesn't want

274
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,010
a concubine-born daughter,

275
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:21,600
but it doesn't mean the Young Master

276
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,090
of the Count Yongchang Manor

277
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,170
doesn't want a concubine's daughter either.

278
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,130
You are right, Mother.

279
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:28,014
I will go.

280
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,520
Now you're enlightened!

281
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:32,890
For the rest of things,

282
00:13:33,332 --> 00:13:35,052
you don't need me

283
00:13:35,052 --> 00:13:36,052
to tell you in detail, right?

284
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:41,908
Here.

285
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,510
Miss.

286
00:14:13,402 --> 00:14:14,042
Miss.

287
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,120
Miss.

288
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,040
Miss, are you alright?

289
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:21,972
I'm fine. I'm fine.

290
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,260
Careful.

291
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,670
Taste it.

292
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,280
Hurry and come rest.

293
00:14:31,522 --> 00:14:32,438
How are you

294
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:33,682
muddy all over?

295
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,200
I tripped.

296
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,260
I don't think it'll be easy today.

297
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,640
No worry.

298
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,375
Sometimes people trip

299
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:42,080
as horses stumble.

300
00:14:42,107 --> 00:14:42,960
It's common occurrence.

301
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,050
Don't be down by it.

302
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,520
Come here.

303
00:14:45,982 --> 00:14:49,164
We've got fruits from Lingnan today

304
00:14:49,164 --> 00:14:50,309
and they are very sweet.

305
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,790
I don't have good look or outstanding talent.

306
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,710
I am not worthy

307
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,590
of your kindness.

308
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,860
I'll be kind to whoever plays jiju well,

309
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,116
just as you do!

310
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,430
I think

311
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,030
you're the only one!

312
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,440
Playing jiju well surely

313
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,320
gets you benefits.

314
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,670
Today we get to eat

315
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,927
such great cherries,

316
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:08,327
thanks to you, Sixth Sister.

317
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:09,510
No, no.

318
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,429
It's all thanks to you, Fifth Sister.

319
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,570
Big Madam allowed us to leave the manor

320
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,010
all thanks to you.

321
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,190
You are the sensible one.

322
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,480
Not like some others.

323
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,430
Sixth Miss.

324
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,670
You play jiju well.

325
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,010
Your discernment is good too.

326
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,010
Help me to have a look.

327
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,100
Can my Sixth Son

328
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,040
win this match?

329
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,160
Sixth Young Master is an outstanding talent,

330
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,280
and he acts heroically.

331
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,220
It doesn't matter whether he wins or not.

332
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,800
I knew

333
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,760
he'd lose this match for sure.

334
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,320
But when

335
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,120
you say it,

336
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,220
it's sure turns to such a sweet note.

337
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,950
Big Madam is right.

338
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:06,990
Our Sixth Sister,

339
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,345
she's prudent all her life.

340
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:09,593
Not like someone else.

341
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,630
who doesn't know herself well,

342
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,110
and wants to claim ties of kinship with the higher-ranking people.

343
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,580
She doesn't know a principle.

344
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,770
A underprivileged person,

345
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:18,850
even if she climbs up,

346
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:19,890
a breeze of wind

347
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,484
will blow her down,

348
00:16:21,484 --> 00:16:22,564
and she will feel humiliated!

349
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:23,650
At that time,

350
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,170
I don't know if she would be facing people

351
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:25,410
with that disgraceful face,

352
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,730
or be too ashamed to see others!

353
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,010
You clever girl.

354
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,530
That is a good jiju match.

355
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,450
Fifth Sister is right.

356
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:08,570
But there are just some

357
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,290
silly people in the world.

358
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:11,850
Clumsy and dumb,

359
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:12,438
with no talent at all.

360
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,330
She sees the high-ranking people right in front her

361
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,970
but no matter how she riles up all her energy,

362
00:17:17,687 --> 00:17:18,967
she just can't climb up.

363
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,910
I'll go get my clothes changed.

364
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,150
I'll be back soon.

365
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,225
Sixth Young Master, we just finished the jiju

366
00:17:52,225 --> 00:17:52,940
and you're heading to the poetry meeting already?

367
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,900
That's too diligent!

368
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:54,850
Dude,

369
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,010
you know nothing.

370
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,175
The late Emperor wrote a poem

371
00:17:57,175 --> 00:17:57,960
to urge us to study!

372
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,693
"A book holds a house of gold."

373
00:17:59,693 --> 00:18:01,173
"A book holds a beautiful jade."

374
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,300
Where are you going, Fourth Sister?

375
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,550
I . . .

376
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:28,210
They've prepared

377
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,960
a tent for us to change clothes.

378
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,440
I am going to get changed.

379
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:36,160
The changing tent isn't here.

380
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,920
You've used it before though.

381
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:38,900
How come

382
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,190
you're lost now?

383
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,770
It is none of your business.

384
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,680
It's not my business actually.

385
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:47,790
But Nanny Kong

386
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,490
taught us then

387
00:18:50,144 --> 00:18:51,584
that the sisters are one.

388
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,310
If you commit a mistake,

389
00:18:53,752 --> 00:18:54,712
this younger sister of yours

390
00:18:54,712 --> 00:18:56,352
will be implicated for no reason too.

391
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,710
So I came to remind you, Fourth Sister,

392
00:18:59,517 --> 00:19:00,997
that there are a bunch of men ahead.

393
00:19:01,452 --> 00:19:02,506
The Young Masters are making poetry.

394
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:04,734
You should turn around

395
00:19:04,734 --> 00:19:06,790
and make a pause on the brink of a precipice.

396
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,700
You're trying to scare me?

397
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,750
You won't let me go,

398
00:19:11,114 --> 00:19:12,434
and I insist on going!

399
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,220
Miss.

400
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,585
The Sixth Miss has seen you.

401
00:19:15,585 --> 00:19:16,860
If you don't turn around,

402
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,500
I fear

403
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,380
she will go and tell the Master.

404
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,210
It's not like I'm scared of her!

405
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:22,610
Besides,

406
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:23,730
I wasn't going anyway.

407
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,493
But she mocks me,

408
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,684
and I must go in now.

409
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:30,430
And that will be reasonable enough to tell Father too.

410
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,600
You!

411
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,040
You dared to hit me with mud!

412
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,960
Sister. Sister.

413
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:41,870
Sister, your skirt's dirty.

414
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,523
You'll go embarrass yourself if you go,

415
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:44,413
so you should just go to the tent

416
00:19:44,413 --> 00:19:45,280
and get changed instead.

417
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,560
How dare you hit me like that!

418
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,994
I will tell Father

419
00:19:47,994 --> 00:19:49,800
and have him reprimand you harshly!

420
00:19:50,151 --> 00:19:51,315
That was just a slip of hand.

421
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,511
If you dare,

422
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,290
go and tell

423
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,511
Father about it.

424
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:56,970
Miss.

425
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,826
How about we change into a dress with peach blossom?

426
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:14,250
Miss.

427
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,270
No one paid any attention to us.

428
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,750
Well done, Xiaotao!

429
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,227
I'll make fish soup for you when we go back.

430
00:20:19,671 --> 00:20:20,480
Two bowls.

431
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,320
I can make ten bowls even!

432
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,693
Sixth Son. Sixth Son!

433
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,010
Get into my carriage and we'll go together.

434
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,620
Mother, let me ride the horse.

435
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,583
It's stifling in the carriage.

436
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,210
Get in here!

437
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,060
Mother.

438
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,820
If there's something to discuss,

439
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,740
we'll discuss it at home.

440
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,218
When we get home?

441
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:54,633
As soon as we're home,

442
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:56,727
you'll be holed up in your room

443
00:20:56,727 --> 00:20:57,872
with that slut Chunke,

444
00:20:57,872 --> 00:20:58,712
clinging and kissing.

445
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,970
You just won't hear me talk then.

446
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,800
Hurry. Get in here!

447
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,510
Sit here.

448
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:20,710
Today,

449
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,510
Sixth Miss Sheng left early

450
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,830
and you two didn't talk a couple words in together.

451
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,520
No matter though,

452
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,400
I'll put on a flower assembly in a few days.

453
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:30,670
I'll send invitations again.

454
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,240
But I'm telling you this now.

455
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:34,810
At that time,

456
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,330
if you decline to see her

457
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,290
with any kind of excuse,

458
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,936
don't bother coming to me in the future

459
00:21:38,936 --> 00:21:40,256
if your father scolds you.

460
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,316
I don't know

461
00:21:45,316 --> 00:21:46,300
why you're so hung up on that

462
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,460
concubine-born girl of Sheng House.

463
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,460
She's like a block of wood.

464
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,340
Other than jiju,

465
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,380
she knows nothing.

466
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,740
Concubine-born?

467
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:54,730
What about Chunke?

468
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,025
She's a concubine-born from

469
00:21:56,025 --> 00:21:57,305
your concubine-born older brother's wife!

470
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,520
I haven't seen you ever disliking that.

471
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:02,430
You dote on her like she's a pearl in the palm.

472
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,910
Now you're picky about a concubine-born

473
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:06,270
in an official's house like Sheng's?

474
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,456
Ridiculous!

475
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,880
Mother.

476
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,840
Last time at the jiju match,

477
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:13,006
I saw that

478
00:22:13,006 --> 00:22:14,970
Duke Qi House's Young Lord

479
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,250
was interested in her.

480
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,190
You should look into it.

481
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,620
Maybe that Qi House already

482
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,140
reserved her as their concubine.

483
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:23,610
Don't do it for nothing

484
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,760
and make a futile effort.

485
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,040
That's just all gossip.

486
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:30,490
Sheng House is an honest scholarly family.

487
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,000
They won't let their children go

488
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,880
and be concubines in a lofty house.

489
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,830
That will court the big laughter

490
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:36,710
of all scholars.

491
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:37,930
I think it's because

492
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:40,090
that Minglan girl,

493
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,320
she's too good

494
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:42,526
and it's caused jealousy

495
00:22:42,526 --> 00:22:44,110
from the shameful lot.

496
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,550
That's how the gossip came about.

497
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:47,530
Then what if it's true though?

498
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:49,270
If it were true,

499
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,730
then that Qi House Young Lord,

500
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:53,691
he's got better taste than you.

501
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,120
Mother.

502
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,025
It's not something good to

503
00:22:56,025 --> 00:22:56,880
talk about in public.

504
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,225
Our Count Yongchang Manor has to

505
00:22:58,225 --> 00:22:59,070
worry about our reputation.

506
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,690
If you really cared about reputation,

507
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:03,950
you'd kick that

508
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,010
little seductress out.

509
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:05,890
And I won't force you

510
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,118
to marry that Miss Sheng!

511
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,220
Han'er,

512
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,820
I'm already making concessions here.

513
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:22,550
Just be obedient and marry a proper wife.

514
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,110
In the future,

515
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,910
whoever you want in your room,

516
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,510
I won't bother about that. Alright?

517
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,740
Be good.

518
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,470
Mother.

519
00:23:34,768 --> 00:23:37,430
If I must marry a Sheng girl,

520
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,430
I find the Fourth Miss

521
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,076
better than Sixth Miss actually.

522
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:41,170
Shut up!

523
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,640
Don't even think of it.

524
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,200
That's another

525
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,520
flippant seductress.

526
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,330
She'll undertake anything

527
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,010
to please you.

528
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:54,208
If you marry someone like her,

529
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:55,208
forget about

530
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:56,248
any future exam and official rank!

531
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:00,810
Let me tell you,

532
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:03,060
if you dare to flirt with her again,

533
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,740
and ruin this marriage prospect with Sheng House,

534
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,340
I will

535
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:05,940
squeeze out all those

536
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,490
in your room!

537
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:08,504
Believe it or not!

538
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,960
You pissed me off!

539
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,272
These fabrics are too coarse.

540
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,310
Only this organdie

541
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,237
is good enough.

542
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:46,280
But the color is a bit bright.

543
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,520
To wear it as clothing

544
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,000
might seem too vulgar.

545
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,570
These are the most trendy fabrics

546
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:57,851
in the capital right now.

547
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,210
Every time we restock these,

548
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:01,237
they're sold out in less than half a day.

549
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,220
What's great about trendy?

550
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,970
Everyone's wearing it,

551
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,610
and I won't stand out.

552
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:08,770
Go back and pick out some

553
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,460
elegantly-colored nice fabrics.

554
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,839
Don't worry about the cost.

555
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:13,460
We can afford it.

556
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,559
Yes.

557
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:20,070
You are just so restless.

558
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,360
What's the big deal about an outfit!

559
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,200
One got soiled,

560
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,080
and you can just make eight or ten more.

561
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:26,970
Is it worth mentioning?

562
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:29,738
But that Sixth Girl.

563
00:25:29,738 --> 00:25:32,530
She's got quite the mind.

564
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,450
Mother.

565
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:34,770
Why do you always boost others' morale

566
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,050
and reduce our own courage?

567
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,220
The future is long.

568
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,740
We'll have literati gathering for many times.

569
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,670
If I want to meet Sixth Young Master,

570
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:42,910
I'll have lots of chances.

571
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:43,990
I'm sure he'll go along with me.

572
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,301
But I think we need to

573
00:25:46,301 --> 00:25:47,941
watch out for this Sixth Girl.

574
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,602
Maybe she's found out something?

575
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,000
Sixth Girl is so dumb and foolish.

576
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,930
She wanted to marry off into the high-ranking House,

577
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,650
but was fooled and manipulated

578
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:58,440
by that Princess Pingning,

579
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,640
and made some stupid mistakes.

580
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:01,465
She can't compare to me.

581
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,390
Mother,

582
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,990
if you keep saying that about me,

583
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,190
you go meet this Sixth Young Master

584
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,487
by yourself then.

585
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:12,610
How long were you just out

586
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:14,449
that you no longer obey my words?

587
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,680
Mistress.

588
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,760
What's happening?

589
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,040
I just passed by Weiruixuan earlier

590
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,279
and I heard shattering of bowls and plates,

591
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:21,480
as if someone's throwing a fit.

592
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,593
I went closer and listened through the walls.

593
00:26:22,593 --> 00:26:24,350
It's Big Madam shouting and cursing.

594
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,050
She said that Big Madam Wu

595
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:25,830
of the Count Yongchang Manor

596
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,790
sent an invitation

597
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,390
only inviting Sixth Miss.

598
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,000
What?

599
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:31,790
Did you hear it cleary?

600
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,470
I heard clearly, Miss.

601
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,800
That invitation is about a refined

602
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,693
Fragrance Tasting and Flower Arrangement gathering

603
00:26:35,693 --> 00:26:37,550
and all our misses were initially invited.

604
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,630
Big Madam was afraid that Fifth Miss would embarrass herself,

605
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,650
so she said that she's sick with cold.

606
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:42,925
The messenger then said that

607
00:26:42,925 --> 00:26:44,500
it's fine to only have Sixth Miss go.

608
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,700
What?

609
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,277
Miss!

610
00:26:49,486 --> 00:26:51,130
Why not let me go? Mo'er

611
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,427
If she can't do flower arrangements, I can.

612
00:26:52,427 --> 00:26:54,048
I don't have a cold either.

613
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,170
I want to go.

614
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,500
No wonder she would pull Minglan

615
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,780
to chat with her every time she comes here.

616
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:04,450
So all this time,

617
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,850
she's her target!

618
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,475
She's only pulling my Rulan

619
00:27:07,475 --> 00:27:08,360
with them to be a cover.

620
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,840
If this gets out,

621
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,541
don't know how shameful it will be for me!

622
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:14,730
What is this

623
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:16,410
Big Madam Wu planning?

624
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,260
Could it be that Young Master

625
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,274
Liang has some disability?

626
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,274
You think I've never seen that Sixth Son Liang?

627
00:27:22,835 --> 00:27:24,475
He has such decent appearance, handsome,

628
00:27:24,475 --> 00:27:25,634
and talented.

629
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,400
He's also the son of a count.

630
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,075
Even if he doesn't inherit

631
00:27:29,075 --> 00:27:29,800
the count title in the future,

632
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,354
he still has abundant wealth

633
00:27:32,354 --> 00:27:33,394
and an official position based on merit.

634
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,390
For such a good marriage prospect,

635
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:37,125
how could I let that lowly girl

636
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:38,280
take advantage of it?

637
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,520
How can I not be mad?

638
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,016
You're quite idle.

639
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,775
How could you still be in the mood

640
00:27:47,775 --> 00:27:48,380
to leisurely read books?

641
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:50,970
Even if I get so agitated,

642
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,470
that Big Madam

643
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:55,337
won't still want me to be her daughter-in-law.

644
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,820
Can you not be so disappointing?

645
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,275
Marrying off into the count manor

646
00:28:04,275 --> 00:28:05,030
is already being successful?

647
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,500
Mother,

648
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,685
have you forgotten my older sister?

649
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,620
She indeed married into a respectable family.

650
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,500
After being married off,

651
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,052
she didn't have a day of peaceful life.

652
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,750
Even after bearing a son,

653
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,520
her mother-in-law and sister-in-law

654
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,040
still continued to bully her.

655
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:21,050
The Yuan Family has three sons.

656
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,293
The Liang Family has six sons.

657
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,190
The more people, the more complicated it is.

658
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,350
Everything is entangled.

659
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:31,270
Maybe it would be worse than the Yuan Family.

660
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,900
I don't want to

661
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,640
get married into a family like that.

662
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:40,230
If you don't want this marriage,

663
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,683
just don't.

664
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,000
But Minglan

665
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,320
she takes this advantage of you.

666
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,020
Big Madam, don't be angry.

667
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:50,975
After coming back from

668
00:28:50,975 --> 00:28:52,416
visiting our relatives in Youyang,

669
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,750
Old Madam has already transferred Sixth Miss

670
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,510
under your house.

671
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,800
If this marriage

672
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,800
ends up with Sixth Miss,

673
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:03,550
it's also still under our house.

674
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,500
I think those people at Linqi Pavilion

675
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,060
will really die from anger.

676
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,504
That bitch should

677
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,798
stop daydreaming!

678
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,269
Mother, what should we do?

679
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,510
It seems that Minglan will be

680
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,170
married off into the count's house now.

681
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,662
Nothing tangible is yet in sight.

682
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,450
The Liang Family hasn't officially

683
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:24,520
come to our house to propose marriage either,

684
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,760
so how could this be a final matter?

685
00:29:26,251 --> 00:29:27,131
Why are you panicking?

686
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,680
How could I not panic?

687
00:29:29,153 --> 00:29:31,073
Big Madam Wu has already set her eyes on Minglan.

688
00:29:31,073 --> 00:29:32,514
It's not a big deal for Big Madam Wu

689
00:29:32,514 --> 00:29:33,154
to choose Minglan.

690
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,570
What's important is that

691
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:35,730
Young Master Liang has you in his heart.

692
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,324
There then is a chance to turn things around.

693
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,440
Although I've met

694
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,680
that Young Master Liang a few times

695
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,782
and exchanged a few words with him,

696
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,200
I don't know

697
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,440
what his true feelings are.

698
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,420
After all, exchanging of affection through gazes

699
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,180
and discussing marriage

700
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,500
are two different things.

701
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,725
Moreover,

702
00:29:50,725 --> 00:29:52,485
even if he indeed likes me,

703
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,594
he still might not want to marry me.

704
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,390
Who was so stubborn

705
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:57,700
earlier saying that Young Master Liang

706
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,590
would surely listen to her?

707
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,470
Now, you're panicking?

708
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,080
Mother,

709
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,430
stop lecturing me.

710
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,621
Even if he likes me,

711
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:09,110
he wouldn't dare disobey his mother.

712
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:15,050
Silly child.

713
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,493
Your father also

714
00:30:16,493 --> 00:30:18,013
have a main wife first,

715
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,780
and despite Old Madam's opposition,

716
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,820
he still made an exception

717
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,820
to take me in.

718
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,520
He even gave us farmlands and shops,

719
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,560
making us have enough food and clothing right now.

720
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,919
So I'm telling you

721
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,295
it's not important if the parents approve.

722
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:30,803
What's important is

723
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:32,690
how to grab hold of the man's heart.

724
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,110
With it,

725
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,870
you'll always be victorious.

726
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,320
How did Big Madam reply to

727
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,600
that messenger from the House of Liang?

728
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,110
At first, Big Madam was so angry,

729
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,590
but then she stopped afterwards.

730
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,040
She then told the messenger that

731
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,400
if Fifth Miss won't be going,

732
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,000
then all the Sheng misses won't go anymore.

733
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,860
She's doing it deliberately.

734
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,420
Mother,

735
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,020
if I'm unable to see Sixth Young Master Liang,

736
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,580
even if I have tricks,

737
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,290
I won't be able to work out.

738
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:02,050
You're getting agitated with just a little trouble.

739
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,130
What great things can you achieve?

740
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,190
So you can achieve it?

741
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:05,830
You tell me then,

742
00:31:06,734 --> 00:31:07,614
what should we do now?

743
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:11,820
I'm afraid

744
00:31:12,134 --> 00:31:13,294
we must beg your father for this matter.

745
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:15,810
There you go.

746
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:30,910
Get up. Get up.

747
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,301
I have something to talk with you about.

748
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:39,760
No wonder you slept here

749
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,960
in my room tonight.

750
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,650
One who is unaccountably solicitous

751
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:44,825
is hiding evil intentions.

752
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,300
Look at what you're saying.

753
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,200
I just want to ask something.

754
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,000
I heard that

755
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,320
Countess Yongchang

756
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,800
has invited our daughters to her manor

757
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,900
for some cultured gathering.

758
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,000
Why did you refuse it?

759
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,960
Rulan has a cold,

760
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,320
wasn't feeling well, and can't go.

761
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,110
You and Old Madam

762
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:14,150
have always lectured me

763
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:15,770
that I must be fair to all of them.

764
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,740
If not all three of them can go,

765
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,340
it's better that they all not go.

766
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,310
That then would be fair.

767
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:27,889
I know that deep inside,

768
00:33:27,889 --> 00:33:28,896
you're scheming to

769
00:33:28,896 --> 00:33:30,456
find Rulan a good in-law.

770
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,433
But the marriage

771
00:33:33,433 --> 00:33:34,387
of Molan and Minglan

772
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:35,867
are also pressing.

773
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:38,924
Concubine Lin, being a concubine,

774
00:33:38,924 --> 00:33:40,604
can't openly go out and socialize.

775
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:42,450
Obviously

776
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:43,770
she must rely on you.

777
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:49,500
Minglan has Old Madam planning for her.

778
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,080
I don't have a say in it.

779
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,200
That Molan has great natural beauty

780
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:56,950
and character.

781
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,495
She won't worry about not finding a good marriage.

782
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:04,182
And you even said that you'll be fair earlier.

783
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,040
You keep making excuses.

784
00:34:06,313 --> 00:34:07,913
That's not being biased?

785
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,780
Fine. I'll go.

786
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,870
But the Countess has sent word

787
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:15,230
that she only wants Minglan to go.

788
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:17,650
What about Molan?

789
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,650
That Big Madam Wu didn't even

790
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:25,413
give any attention to my Rulan,

791
00:34:25,413 --> 00:34:25,900
and just wants Minglan.

792
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,730
You want me to still let Molan go there?

793
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:27,370
Aren't I intentionally

794
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,100
inciting conflicts with her?

795
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,250
It's just because she has such a bad luck

796
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:32,570
and not earn the affection of the Countess.

797
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,558
Husband, don't blame me

798
00:34:33,558 --> 00:34:35,266
for being biased this time!

799
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,550
Fourth Sister!

800
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:57,750
Is it you, Fourth Sister?

801
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,320
I...

802
00:35:04,843 --> 00:35:05,719
am about to

803
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:07,130
go greet Grandmother.

804
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,181
I just happen to pass by here.

805
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:10,830
I thought that

806
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:12,180
because you heard that

807
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,180
I'm going out,

808
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,740
you especially came here to send me off.

809
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,020
In terms of fragrances tasting, flower arrangement, and poetry,

810
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,675
I'm inferior to you, Fourth Sister.

811
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,000
It's just that you didn't want

812
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,400
to attend the cultured gathering of Countess,

813
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,310
or else if you went,

814
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:25,200
you surely would bring honor

815
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,383
to our Sheng family.

816
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:30,490
I initially thought

817
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:31,125
that you are a well-behaved

818
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:31,696
and an honest person.

819
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:32,912
Never thought

820
00:35:32,912 --> 00:35:33,952
that you're also

821
00:35:33,952 --> 00:35:35,800
double-tongued.

822
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,450
Others give you some benefits,

823
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,488
and you just start flattering.

824
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,210
Who do you plan to hook up with so that

825
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:41,130
you've dolled yourself up so attractively?

826
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,946
Sister, your words are too unpleasant.

827
00:35:45,946 --> 00:35:47,266
I'm attending an assembly of cultured people.

828
00:35:47,633 --> 00:35:49,228
If I'm able to earn

829
00:35:49,228 --> 00:35:51,153
the praises of any lad,

830
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:52,250
that is because

831
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,230
he appreciates my talent.

832
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,032
How can you say

833
00:35:55,032 --> 00:35:56,650
that it's hooking up?

834
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:58,050
You clearly know that Sixth Young Master is there

835
00:35:58,050 --> 00:35:59,610
and you still dressed up so attractively.

836
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,820
Sixth Young Master?

837
00:36:02,942 --> 00:36:04,022
Which one?

838
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,240
Sixth Young Master of which house?

839
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,440
Is it the Zhang's, the Wang's,

840
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,923
the Xie's, or the Li's?

841
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:10,599
Which Sixth Young Master

842
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:12,780
are you talking about, Sister?

843
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,150
Miss,

844
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,630
it's getting late. Let's go now.

845
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:17,924
If we're late,

846
00:36:17,924 --> 00:36:20,100
Big Madam will scold you.

847
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,230
Fourth Sister, take care.

848
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:25,410
I'll get going now.

849
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,190
Damn that girl!

850
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:35,925
Trying to step on me

851
00:36:35,925 --> 00:36:36,750
just to go higher!

852
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,270
No way!

853
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,595
It's dark, but they're not back yet.

854
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:51,950
She usually isn't like this

855
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:53,262
when she goes out.

856
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,365
Minglan must be excessively fawning on

857
00:36:55,365 --> 00:36:56,805
that Big Madam Wu.

858
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:58,875
Flattering the Sixth Young Master Liang

859
00:36:58,875 --> 00:36:59,690
and refusing to leave.

860
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,360
She might even

861
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,560
have said a lot of bad things about me.

862
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,280
However，

863
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,060
I'm unable to leave this house.

864
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,640
I'm unable to use all the tricks that I have.

865
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,382
How can I be at ease and just sit down!

866
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,590
Quickly clean that up!

867
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:15,610
Why don't you use your brain?

868
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:16,730
With Big Madam there,

869
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:17,850
how could she watch Minglan

870
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:20,259
climbing up a big tree like that of the Countess?

871
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:21,770
Big Madam won't help her,

872
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:22,890
but she won't help me either.

873
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,489
No matter how you think about it,

874
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,440
I'm on the losing end here!

875
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,760
Human effort is the decisive factor.

876
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,000
Is it useful to complain,

877
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,850
act irritably or

878
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:30,757
vent your anger?

879
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,200
Sit down.

880
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,480
Look at what you've become.

881
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,200
You're not acting like a noble lady at all.

882
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,080
You're about to go to Shouan Hall

883
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,360
to greet Old Madam.

884
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,360
If you're like this,

885
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,566
aren't you just letting them to laugh at you?

886
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,792
Mistress,

887
00:37:45,792 --> 00:37:47,392
Big Madam and Sixth Miss are back.

888
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,650
They're calling for Fourth Miss

889
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:50,570
to go to Shouan Hall with them and greet Old Madam.

890
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:53,150
Look at that.

891
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,390
This is clearly calling me to go there

892
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,350
to humiliate me

893
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:56,390
in front of everyone!

894
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,380
Tell them that I'm sick.

895
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,980
I'm not going.

896
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,820
Silly girl. You must go.

897
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,620
If you don't go,

898
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,460
that's exactly asking

899
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,750
them to humiliate you.

900
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:06,590
Not only are you going,

901
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:07,390
you are going in an open and magnanimous manner.

902
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:09,570
No matter how Big Madam and Minglan

903
00:38:09,581 --> 00:38:10,970
praise the wealth of the Count Yongchang Manor,

904
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:12,590
you must pretend to not care.

905
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,697
They want to see you go wild and angry,

906
00:38:14,697 --> 00:38:16,217
so you must show them how calm

907
00:38:16,217 --> 00:38:17,320
and unaffected you are.

908
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:18,985
So what if I'm calm and unaffected!

909
00:38:18,985 --> 00:38:20,250
Won't I still be just watching as Minglan

910
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,666
gets married into the House of Liang?

911
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,900
No matter how bad the situation is,

912
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,500
you must maintain your appearance.

913
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,800
If your external face is ruined,

914
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,975
then everyone will really know

915
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:30,935
that you've broken down.

916
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,300
Today, all the important people were

917
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,200
in the Count Yongchang Manor!

918
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,200
I've never seen such a huge event.

919
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,120
Duke Ying of the State, Duke Yue of the State,

920
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,390
all families

921
00:38:58,390 --> 00:38:59,790
with young daughters had come.

922
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,560
You couldn't even count them anymore.

923
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:03,450
I didn't even know some of them.

924
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:04,200
It was so bustling as if

925
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,130
it were a New Year's celebration.

926
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,200
Big Madam Wu even

927
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,400
called her Sixth Son out.

928
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:11,410
He kept greeting everyone

929
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:13,010
as "Auntie" this and that!

930
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:14,650
Sixth Little Sister,

931
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:16,770
the color of your mutton-fat jade

932
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,420
seems to be better than that one

933
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,300
I wore during my birthday.

934
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,520
It seems that Big Madam Wu

935
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:23,930
can really afford to give gifts.

936
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:25,726
She gave you two at once.

937
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:27,150
Fifth Sister,

938
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:27,870
you like it?

939
00:39:28,288 --> 00:39:29,368
I'll give one to you.

940
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,920
Big Madam Wu even gave me

941
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,040
a lot of valuable gifts.

942
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,660
I don't have that much luck

943
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:35,664
to enjoy

944
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:36,904
such valuable gifts.

945
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,000
With you sharing the blessing with me,

946
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,840
I feel more at ease.

947
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:42,850
It's still you who knows how to talk

948
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:43,924
and is more sensible.

949
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:45,770
This is what a good sister should be.

950
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:47,700
Fourth Sister,

951
00:39:47,951 --> 00:39:49,925
the Countess also

952
00:39:49,925 --> 00:39:50,990
gave me a beaded hairpin.

953
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:53,024
There are five pearls which are this big.

954
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:53,784
I'll send someone to

955
00:39:53,784 --> 00:39:54,998
deliver it to your room later.

956
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,130
No need.

957
00:39:56,684 --> 00:39:58,200
I do have a box full

958
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,640
of hairpins like that.

959
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,690
It's not such rare.

960
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:03,090
Sixth Little Sister

961
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:04,970
should just keep and wear it.

962
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,210
Fourth Sister, you said it right.

963
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:07,601
I indeed haven't

964
00:40:07,601 --> 00:40:09,560
seen much in this world.

965
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,440
I just saw

966
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,676
some sons and daughters of

967
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:13,980
counts and marquis houses.

968
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,380
I shouldn't forget my own status.

969
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,300
I indeed need a beating.

970
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:19,930
It seems that I must socialize more

971
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:21,580
with Big Madam,

972
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,247
so I will learn the rules of

973
00:40:22,247 --> 00:40:23,447
noble and rich aristocratic families

974
00:40:23,447 --> 00:40:24,487
to broaden my knowledge.

975
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,720
Why are you speaking

976
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,492
so cleverly today?

977
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,070
Big Madam Wu said that

978
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:34,230
I only know to play polo,

979
00:40:34,506 --> 00:40:35,950
but am quite a mess in other things.

980
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:38,284
She asked me to learn how to converse with her.

981
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,020
Grandmother, please forgive me.

982
00:40:45,553 --> 00:40:46,753
I don't feel well.

983
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,705
I'll be going back to my room now.

984
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,719
Come back here!

985
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:07,752
Sit down.

986
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,010
You don't intend to marry into the Count's manor,

987
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,240
so why bother putting on such an act?

988
00:41:31,977 --> 00:41:33,795
Do you just want to anger Molan

989
00:41:33,795 --> 00:41:34,984
and Concubine Lin?

990
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,820
It was Big Madam Wu who graciously invited me

991
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:38,940
to attend that scholar assembly.

992
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,340
It wasn't my desire to go.

993
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,100
Yet, the two of them successively

994
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,690
came to make things difficult for me.

995
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:44,210
Since she's already

996
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,210
bullying me in the face,

997
00:41:45,417 --> 00:41:46,577
I can't just let her do it, right?

998
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,980
You don't usually act like this.

999
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,190
Did Molan bully you?

1000
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:57,079
No.

1001
00:41:57,602 --> 00:41:59,002
These are just matters between us children.

1002
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,475
Grandmother, there's no need

1003
00:42:00,475 --> 00:42:01,160
for you to be bothered by it.

1004
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,160
Just live peacefully

1005
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:04,410
and let me serve you forever.

1006
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:05,170
Talk nonsense!

1007
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,289
Don't say such things.

1008
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:10,250
Once bitten,

1009
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:11,250
twice shy.

1010
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,300
After slipping and falling badly,

1011
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,460
you don't want to go out of the house anymore?

1012
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,080
How can there be such a thing?

1013
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:23,750
Hongwen is a considerate child.

1014
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,680
Today, he sent some

1015
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,080
of your favorite fruits.

1016
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:31,100
He said that he personally made

1017
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:31,875
those medicinal foods

1018
00:42:31,875 --> 00:42:32,887
which are good for the health.

1019
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,155
Look,

1020
00:42:36,155 --> 00:42:38,450
isn't this a very good thing?

1021
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:45,470
I won't force you.

1022
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:49,870
Think about it well.
