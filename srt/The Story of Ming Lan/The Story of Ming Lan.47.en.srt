00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,580
Episode 47

3
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,840
Aunties, what makes you come here today

4
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,200
in our Zhaohui Hall today?

5
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,520
It's about time for lunch,

6
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,520
why don't we move to the Flower Hall

7
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,760
to have some meal and tea?

8
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,800
I'll tell the kitchen to prepare

9
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,200
some fresh vegetable.

10
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,080
Hold on.

11
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,960
Do you plan to do a cicada

12
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,920
shedding its carapace on us?

13
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,520
Are you looking for

14
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,760
an excuse to hide from us?

15
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,036
Aunt, you must be kidding, I'm...

16
00:01:33,036 --> 00:01:34,520
We were tricked by you once.

17
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,240
Forget about trying to escape this time.

18
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,900
Aunt, this is my home.

19
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,180
Why would I hide from you?

20
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,280
Your home?

21
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,600
This is the home of the Gu family.

22
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,175
Don't think that just

23
00:01:45,175 --> 00:01:46,200
because you married into the Gu family,

24
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,160
you can be the main mother of the family?

25
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,240
Be careful of us

26
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,600
exposing all your

27
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,520
ugly matters before,

28
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,200
and let Brother Ye get rid of you.

29
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,400
Ugly matters? What ugly matters?

30
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,080
Tell her.

31
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,000
tell her

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,320
Sister-in-law, don't be anxious.

33
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:03,950
If there's anything to say,

34
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,640
let's take our time to talk.

35
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,315
We are a family.

36
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,960
If this ruckus gets out,

37
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,320
we will lose our dignities.

38
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,360
No.

39
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,960
Aunties, stop beating around the bush.

40
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,120
Speak then.

41
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,560
I will listen.

42
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,120
I would like to know

43
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,920
why the General

44
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,080
wants to get rid of me.

45
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,040
Before you married

46
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,160
our Ye'er,

47
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,850
weren't you engaged

48
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,120
to Physician He?

49
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,320
I didn't.

50
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,600
You didn't?

51
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,760
How come your past interaction

52
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,400
got exposed by other people?

53
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,800
Auntie, were you talking about

54
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,320
our social interaction or marriage engagement?

55
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,500
These are

56
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,660
two different matters.

57
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,480
If you're engaged to be married,

58
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,400
won't you two naturally have interactions?

59
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,320
Of course, we have past interactions.

60
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,800
It's all because our grandmothers are friends.

61
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,680
There wasn't any engagement.

62
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,240
You two think

63
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,075
that because I'm just

64
00:02:58,075 --> 00:02:59,160
an illegitimate daughter of a lowly clan.

65
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,275
It's because I've accumulated

66
00:03:00,275 --> 00:03:01,040
enough good karma in my past life

67
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,280
and that my ancestral tombs emitted blue smoke，

68
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,720
that's why, I was able to marry into your family.

69
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,000
You think that loudly urging me would make

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,560
my soul leave my body form extreme'mafraid

71
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,520
and then be very submissive.

72
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,480
Is that so?

73
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,720
She didn't mean that.

74
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,725
She's just afraid

75
00:03:14,725 --> 00:03:16,280
that other people will gossip a lot.

76
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,400
Whoever wants to gossip, let them do so.

77
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:20,905
No need

78
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,840
to especially say them in front of me.

79
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,760
Look at

80
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,840
the scene you created.

81
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,960
How will she help us now?

82
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,520
Minglan.

83
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,070
She didn't pay attention to me.

84
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,280
She didn't even look at me one bit.

85
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,080
I've never seen this.

86
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,080
Xiatao did look at me.

87
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,320
She ruthlessly gives me a glance.

88
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,800
Just let her then.

89
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,760
What are you happy about?

90
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,320
How could I not be happy?

91
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,560
She has never done this to me.

92
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,880
Ruthlessly gives you a glance.

93
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,000
So, Aunts are here.

94
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,600
Do you know

95
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,800
you have been tricked by someone?

96
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,575
Before your marriage,

97
00:04:20,575 --> 00:04:21,760
your wife got engaged with the He Family

98
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,120
behind your back.

99
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,080
Do you know about this?

100
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,040
So,

101
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,360
you are here to gossip.

102
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,080
There wasn't any engagement,

103
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,720
but there are interactions.

104
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,400
You knew about it?

105
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,360
I knew.

106
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,440
It was even me

107
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,080
who employed some tricks

108
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,160
and snatched my wife away

109
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,440
from the He family.

110
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,840
If I took action too late,

111
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,750
I'mafraid they

112
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,790
would have gotten married.

113
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,120
Dear aunts, you must really dote on me.

114
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,360
Your family is already in deep trouble,

115
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,640
but still came here to seek justice for me

116
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,920
for these old matters.

117
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,080
Thank you very much, Aunties.

118
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,360
Stop laughing.

119
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,280
Wife.

120
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,320
Wife, don't be angry.

121
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,840
I've already personally

122
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,360
let them go back.

123
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,360
You didn't see

124
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,480
their faces.

125
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,600
It was really so colorful!

126
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,840
So nice to look at!

127
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,880
For them to come here and beg me

128
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,960
is already in the wrong.

129
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,160
They even used this

130
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,585
this matter

131
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,600
that can destroy a family

132
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,560
to threaten me.

133
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,560
We are all women.

134
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,560
They surely know that

135
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,360
this kind of matter

136
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,320
isn't kidding.

137
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,360
If it wasn't handled properly,

138
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,075
it will cause a person's reputation

139
00:06:04,075 --> 00:06:04,640
to be completely destroyed.

140
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,040
I'll inform the prison right now

141
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,160
to beat those two cousins of mine,

142
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,880
so as to vent anger

143
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,720
on your behalf.

144
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,720
Don't go.

145
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,120
You don let me to do anything.

146
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,960
What can I do

147
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,840
when you are angry?

148
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,000
I can only use this method.

149
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,520
If you're mad,

150
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,240
just close the doors and curse a little.

151
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,320
That will be enough.

152
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,080
If this goes out,

153
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,920
it will become a laughing matter.

154
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,880
People will gossip.

155
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,160
You'll lose more than what you gained.

156
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,240
We mustn't do losing business like that.

157
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,520
What then must we do with those two women

158
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,440
sitting in Zhaohui Hall

159
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,360
and refusing to leave?

160
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,600
So what if they don't leave.

161
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,960
Our general manor

162
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,240
surely can afford to feed them,

163
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,200
right?

164
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,520
Naturally.

165
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,560
If they insist to stay here,

166
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,760
let's not show our face

167
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
to them from now.

168
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,760
Let's just give them a cold shoulder.

169
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,080
Let's see who will endure who.

170
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,640
This will be a good show to watch.

171
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,200
The duel between Madam Sheng

172
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,480
and the Gu auntie-in-laws!

173
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,200
Exciting. It's exciting.

174
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,960
You. You.

175
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,960
I'm helping you block the wind and rain!

176
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,240
Charging into the front line for you!

177
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,360
And you still mock me?

178
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,800
I know, I know.

179
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,960
What can I do

180
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,920
about this?

181
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,760
Just give find me a few people

182
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,480
who can write well,

183
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,080
write decently.

184
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,560
What a great Sheng Minglan.

185
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,000
She dares to walk out on her elders?

186
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,520
She dares to make us wait like this?!

187
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,320
So preposterous!

188
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,240
Sister-in-law, it's better to calm down.

189
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,680
Since we've decided to

190
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,200
grind away their patience,

191
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,920
this will surely take time.

192
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,960
You better save your energy.

193
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,720
I'm angry.

194
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,800
I should scold.

195
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,400
Sheng Minglan, come out!

196
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,320
Gu Tingye, come out too!

197
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,840
The both of you,

198
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,440
are you trying to ride

199
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,560
above the head of your relatives

200
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,720
to show your imposing might?

201
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,000
You want to use the heads of your cousins

202
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,560
to ask for merit,

203
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,200
is that it?

204
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,600
You won't get any good retribution!

205
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,120
Let me tell you.

206
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,840
If anything were

207
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,920
to happen to my Tingbing,

208
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,040
I will die in your home!

209
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,360
Sister-in-law,

210
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,160
you're getting worse and worse.

211
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,760
How are you like an official's wife?

212
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,760
Why are you acting like a good person here?

213
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,160
How come only

214
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,160
I was interrogating her earlier?

215
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,280
What about you?!

216
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,235
As if your son is fine

217
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,360
and only my son

218
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,320
got arrested.

219
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,760
You are like that woman in the marquis manor,

220
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,640
just letting me be the one

221
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,640
to make all the noise,

222
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,250
and you just sit here waiting

223
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,200
for the result.

224
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,190
This is not what I meant.

225
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,360
What did you mean then?!

226
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,520
What does this means?

227
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,720
Big Madam afraid that you two will get hungry.

228
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,725
She specially instructed the kitchen

229
00:09:12,725 --> 00:09:13,400
to cook a meal for you.

230
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,480
If you still don't want to leave after you have eaten,

231
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,480
Big Madam said that

232
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,680
she'll have the rooms

233
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,600
in the western courtyard cleaned up

234
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,920
so you two can live there as you like.

235
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,520
Even if your daughter-in-laws come,

236
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,520
you all will still fit in there.

237
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,600
Are you people squandering time

238
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,600
with us here?!

239
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,520
Fine. You are not afraid of anything, right?

240
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,300
Okay then. I'll accompany you people

241
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,040
and continue stirring up trouble.

242
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,400
If these two children don't return,

243
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,280
I won't leave your home!

244
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,240
Let's eat.

245
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,880
Come on.

246
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,920
Let's eat. Why are you standing there?

247
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,200
This.

248
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,000
What does this means?

249
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,920
I'm the accountant of the manor.

250
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,200
Big Madam thinks that this matter is quite grave.

251
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,680
It's hard to explain things if news reach

252
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,880
the ears of His Majesty.

253
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,920
Hence, she told me

254
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,680
to write done

255
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,480
whatever you said.

256
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,640
If ever His Majesty or Her Highness

257
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,200
calls anyone in the house for questioning,

258
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,880
they will know what to answer.

259
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,400
Sister-in-law.

260
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,400
Replying to Big Madam and General, both of them have left.

261
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,680
Nanny Cui also said

262
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,080
that they didn't even touch any of the food.

263
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,520
These uncles and aunts of mine

264
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,200
haven't changed at all.

265
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,680
In the past,

266
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,100
if there are any matters that

267
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,000
we need to ask other people for a favors,

268
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,800
it was always be my father who did it.

269
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,360
They all have been

270
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,320
pampered all their lives.

271
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,160
Till now, they are still the same.

272
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,480
You also don't want them to beg you.

273
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,160
Why wouldn't I?

274
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,720
I even increased the stake

275
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,280
so they would beg me fiercely.

276
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,800
You don't want them to plead for favors.

277
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,160
You just want them to admit their mistakes.

278
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,640
Wife, you really know me.

279
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,480
I'm also just putting my feet in your shoes.

280
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,040
Anyone who was aggrieved

281
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,760
would want the truth

282
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,080
to come out one day.

283
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,160
Hoping that everyone would understand

284
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,160
his pain and grievances.

285
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,440
If it were me, I would be the same too.

286
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,240
If those two cousins of mine

287
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,520
committed a grave crime,

288
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,120
that if I don't intervene,

289
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,560
they would surely die,

290
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,840
yet I still press them this hard,

291
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,680
am I still right?

292
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,900
While a person lives,

293
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,480
he would only want a peaceful heart.

294
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,325
If one's heart is at ease,

295
00:12:32,325 --> 00:12:33,920
the world would be quiet and wonderful.

296
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,920
But if he has a grudge and hatred in his heart,

297
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,105
even if the sun is shining high up and

298
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:40,575
there is a gentle breeze

299
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,080
blowing across one's face,

300
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,480
that blade that's slicing

301
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,040
his heart will not stop.

302
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,510
I understand this.

303
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,680
I know.

304
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,440
It's late.

305
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,480
Instruct the kitchen

306
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,960
to brew tea, make some snacks

307
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,880
and deliver them to the study.

308
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,520
Didn't Sir said not

309
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,880
to give him anything to eat?

310
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,840
He can refuse to eat

311
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,160
but we must deliver them.

312
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,280
Or else, if my in-laws find out,

313
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,520
they would blame me

314
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,000
for not knowing how to take care of him.

315
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,960
Xiaoyu!

316
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,080
Go!

317
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,920
Miss, so,

318
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,320
about that daughter of the Sheng family,

319
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,880
do I still have to ask about her?

320
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,840
Forget it.

321
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,840
After asking around,

322
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,640
it was all just those measly things.

323
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,120
If husband really can't let her go,

324
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,375
why didn't he ask for marriage

325
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,120
when he became a widower?

326
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,880
It shows

327
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,400
that it was just some young and insensible act.

328
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,560
Nothing to be suspicious about.

329
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,040
This is great.

330
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,600
Guye

331
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,360
is a refined and upright man.

332
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,880
If he doesn't know how to say some sweet words,

333
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,760
it's also fine.

334
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,440
Miss, don't think much about this.

335
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,000
You are right too.

336
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,960
It must be because

337
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,000
my parents are too sweet with each other

338
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,960
that makes me think

339
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,360
all men

340
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,120
should be like my father,

341
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,520
just circling around his wife.

342
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,000
Okay,

343
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,920
it's late.

344
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,600
After cleaning up this chest,

345
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,840
let's just do the rest tomorrow.

346
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,680
The weather will be changing soon.

347
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,600
By that time,

348
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,320
just place the clothes that we tidied up out

349
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,760
and put them on the top.

350
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,160
They will be easier to find.

351
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,520
Miss.

352
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,440
Qi Xiao'er.

353
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,480
Is that Young Lord?

354
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,960
This two other characters...

355
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,000
Who is that?

356
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,720
I'm sure that it isn't me.

357
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,200
Miss,

358
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,560
don't be afraid.

359
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,160
At least,

360
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,240
you know everything now.

361
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,560
You are right.

362
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,640
The stone in my heart

363
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,120
has finally fallen to the ground.

364
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,800
What are you

365
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,200
planning to do now?

366
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,475
Since I know that

367
00:16:43,475 --> 00:16:44,635
he has someone else in his heart,

368
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,920
I'm going to snatch him back.

369
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,960
Prime Minister Han,

370
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,400
a few days ago, you mentioned in your memorial

371
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,680
that there hasn't been no rain for a long time

372
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,480
and His Majesty is getting worried.

373
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,080
He would like to go to Taiyi Palace

374
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,875
to light incenses and pray for the rain,

375
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,160
to report this to the deities

376
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,440
and that you need the seal.

377
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,240
You then took the jade seal away.

378
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,920
It's been so many days.

379
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,280
The jade seal should be returned already, right?

380
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,040
Informing Empress Dowager,

381
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,200
since ascending to the throne,

382
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,075
His Majesty has been diligent in governance,

383
00:17:41,075 --> 00:17:41,575
loving to his citizens,

384
00:17:41,575 --> 00:17:42,360
and is fully equipped with sage morals.

385
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,320
In the asking for rain ceremony,

386
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,400
the citizens of the capital looked

387
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,400
at His Majesty with reverence.

388
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,800
All were happily

389
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,240
dancing and praising him.

390
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,400
I didn't ask you about this.

391
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,160
I'm talking about the jade seal.

392
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,850
There are too many matters

393
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,000
to handle in governing the empire.

394
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,800
Just to make use of the jade seal,

395
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,440
we have to keep disturbing you.

396
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,960
His Majesty really can't bear to keep doing that.

397
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,775
Hence, he has decided to

398
00:18:08,775 --> 00:18:10,040
keep the jade seal to himself

399
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,640
to avoid any more future troubles.

400
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,840
You!

401
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,440
You people are openly stealing it from me?

402
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,040
As the emperor,

403
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,475
His Majesty holding the jade seal

404
00:18:36,475 --> 00:18:37,440
is within reason and logic.

405
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,440
How could you say that he stole it?

406
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,200
It was you who said before

407
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,920
that you'mafraid other imperial descendants

408
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,960
will covet for the throne.

409
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,625
You then asked me to listen

410
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:48,880
to the court meetings behind curtains,

411
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,550
So it would be convenient

412
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,480
to quell the court officials.

413
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,480
Yes.

414
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,360
How come now

415
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,800
you're going against your words?

416
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,120
Now, the empire is in peace

417
00:18:59,120 --> 00:18:59,825
and the hearts of the people

418
00:18:59,825 --> 00:19:00,640
has returned to the government.

419
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,840
Won't it satisfy both parties

420
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,600
if Empress Dowager withdraw at this time?

421
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,520
I will decide when I will withdraw!

422
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,880
I won't get forced by you people!

423
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,840
It's impossible for Han Zhang

424
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,680
to have come up with an idea like that,

425
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,480
this poor

426
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,080
and lowly kind of idea.

427
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,775
Among the people

428
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:26,160
around the emperor and Prince Huan,

429
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,080
other than Gu Tingye,

430
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,320
no one else

431
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,880
would think of this method.

432
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,280
Gu Tingye?

433
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,960
This rascal, Gu Tingye.

434
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,920
He's a swindler since young,

435
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,160
How many years have he lived among the brothels?

436
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,160
Other than him.

437
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,760
who else would think of such

438
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,200
shameless method!

439
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,920
Call him to come here.

440
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,320
Summon Gu Tingye to come here.

441
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,840
At such a young age,

442
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,960
you never learn anything good

443
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,680
and just have to learn those

444
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,800
lowly marketplace tricks!

445
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,200
You even dared to use it on me!

446
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,320
When you entered the palace at age 7,

447
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,920
you shattered the lamp in Funing Palace.

448
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,920
If not because I covered it up for you,

449
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,680
when you went home,

450
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,240
you father would have beaten you

451
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,240
till you are full of bruises!

452
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,750
His Majesty wanted you

453
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,480
to lead the Imperial Jin Army.

454
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,600
Do you know how many people

455
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,160
in the government were against it?

456
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,280
It was me who went against public opinion!

457
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,560
I said lots of good things about you!

458
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,560
But what did you do?

459
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,640
You actually connived with a high official

460
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,800
to swindle me.

461
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,400
Playing with an old widow like me.

462
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,880
I admit my mistake.

463
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,160
Empress Dowager, please don't be angry.

464
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,120
If you know that you were wrong,

465
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,760
go and get the jade seal back for me!

466
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,800
I really can't obey your order!

467
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,880
Are you here to seek forgiveness

468
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,800
or to make me angry?

469
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,320
I commit my unforgivable crime.

470
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,760
Empress Dowager,

471
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,040
you can beat or scold me.

472
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,240
Even if you ask me to kneel here the whole night,

473
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,960
I won't complain.

474
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,320
Stop playing your shameless tricks on me.

475
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,000
Do you think I don't dare to beat you?

476
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,360
Somebody! Get the punishment cane.

477
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,520
As long as Empress Dowager can vent your anger,

478
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,680
it's fine even if you kill me.

479
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,280
Why do you go that back?

480
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,280
When they do the punishment,

481
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,560
it will surely be a bloody scene.

482
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,750
I'm afraid that it might traumatize you,

483
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:47,230
hence, I went a bit farther.

484
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Why aren't you beating him?

485
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,960
General Gu has too many scars on his body.

486
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,040
I don't know where to start?

487
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,400
Why can't you beat him?

488
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,560
Even if he's full of scars,

489
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,760
he can't be arrogant just because he's highly favored.

490
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,160
Give it to me.

491
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,840
Empress Dowager, it's best that you step back

492
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,920
or the blood

493
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,400
will splash and make your clothes dirty.

494
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,200
Back then,

495
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,560
you were covered in blood.

496
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,360
You were like an army sent by the heaven

497
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,720
and rescued His Majesty out of danger.

498
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,040
I thought you are a good and upright person

499
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,320
that is loyal to his emperor.

500
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,275
I was loyal to the previous emperor,

501
00:22:47,275 --> 00:22:48,360
is loyal to His Majesty.

502
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,880
I will never change

503
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,840
till the day I die.

504
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,720
What a good speech.

505
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,280
I can't even hit you

506
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,640
in a bold and confident manner.

507
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,520
Go now.

508
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,240
Official Gu.

509
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,320
Young Lord, you.

510
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,600
You.

511
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,800
You actually came up with a bad idea

512
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,760
like that to offend the Empress Dowager?

513
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,080
How can you call that a bad idea?

514
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,775
It's just being respectful first

515
00:23:52,775 --> 00:23:53,640
then being rude after.

516
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,300
Empress Dowager was refusing to hand over

517
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,200
her power and used that jade seal as an excuse.

518
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,880
If you reason out with her,

519
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,760
she'll pretend to be muddled.

520
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,040
Only a

521
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,200
shameless method like that

522
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,360
can work.

523
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,400
Won't she hate you?

524
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,240
Prince Huan and I

525
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,440
am in the same shoes.

526
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,760
Prince Huan is the son of His Majesty.

527
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,840
Empress Dowager

528
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,040
already disliked me for a long time.

529
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,025
Just one trifle matter

530
00:24:25,025 --> 00:24:25,960
like this won't really matter.

531
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,960
Trifle matter.

532
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,450
The person you offended

533
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:30,600
is the curren empress dowager,

534
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,040
the legitimate mother of the emperor.

535
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,175
She has been in charge of the palace

536
00:24:34,175 --> 00:24:34,640
for so many years.

537
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,500
She has planted a tall and deep rotted tree

538
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,160
in the imperial court.

539
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,120
A lot of important minsters are her trusted aides.

540
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,200
She just need to say a few words

541
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,560
if she want you be eliminated.

542
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,480
If she's unhappy,

543
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,520
most serious situation is

544
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,800
I'll just get hit and scolded,

545
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,000
so she can vent her anger.

546
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,800
Anyway, my skin and flesh are thick and coarse.

547
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,560
I won't feel pain even if I get hit.

548
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,480
This isn't a matter of

549
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,600
just getting hit or scolded.

550
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,080
How many people in the government don't like you?

551
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,120
The Qi family even...

552
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,680
What about the Qi Family?

553
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,760
Did you hear anything?

554
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,680
My father was the one who said it.

555
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,360
He said,

556
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,400
although Prince Yong is dead,

557
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,000
he still was the crown prince.

558
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,840
Those sons and grandchildren of his

559
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,760
are still highly favored by Empress Dowager.

560
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,400
Qi Heng

561
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,080
not only has married the daughter of Prince Yong,

562
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,560
Duke Qi of the State

563
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,800
and the older brother of Empress Dowager

564
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,200
were even colleague once.

565
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,680
If the Qi Family goes with the Empress Dowager,

566
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,425
then important officials of the court

567
00:25:50,425 --> 00:25:51,280
will surely follow.

568
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,480
So if

569
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,160
you stand out like this,

570
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,280
I'm afraid...

571
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
Afraid of what?

572
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,125
You're afraid that

573
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:09,680
I'll have a conflict with the Qi Family,

574
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,000
with Qi Heng?

575
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,160
Not only the Qi Family!

576
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,360
So many people are watching you.

577
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,500
Empress Dowager must return

578
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,520
her governing power sooner or later.

579
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,040
If she doesn't hand over the jade seal today,

580
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,600
she would still do in the future.

581
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,280
His Majesty isn't a child anymore.

582
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,120
He can't really rely on her mother

583
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,240
to assist him forever, right?

584
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,280
This stepmother of His Majesty

585
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,600
is similar to mine.

586
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,280
It's different.

587
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,320
That stepmother of yours

588
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,560
lied and deceived you.

589
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,800
She caused you to live such a miserable life.

590
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,240
His Majesty

591
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,800
was able to stabilize the government

592
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,025
and sit on the empire's throne

593
00:26:57,025 --> 00:26:58,000
thanks to this stepmother of his sitting in

594
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,640
during imperial court meetings.

595
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,200
If Empress Dowager mentions this in the future,

596
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,520
you and the others would be in the wrong.

597
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,120
I'm just afraid that those

598
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,280
who stand out would be the first to die.

599
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,080
Even if I don't stand out,

600
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,560
you think Empress Dowager

601
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,320
will easily let me go?

602
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,920
Since the moment

603
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,120
I was born,

604
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,200
I wasn't a person

605
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,520
who can pander to everyone.

606
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,760
I didn't meant to teach you what to do.

607
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,480
It's just that I suffered a lot

608
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,600
because of that when I was little,

609
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,440
so I'm afraid of it.

610
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,560
Wife, no need to worry.

611
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,520
No matter what happens,

612
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,560
I will protect you.

613
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,920
No, I'm not worrying for myself.

614
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,200
I'm afraid that something bad might happen to you.

615
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,920
I'm afraid for your sake.

616
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,688
Really? Really.

617
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,320
You treat me so well.

618
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,500
I'm really afraid of something bad

619
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,040
will happen to you.

620
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,360
No need to be afraid.

621
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,400
Everything

622
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,360
is within my calculations.

623
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,720
Don't be afraid.

624
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,600
Nothing will happen.

625
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,080
You must have gotten the wrong person!

626
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,760
Husband!

627
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,320
I'm not going!

628
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,040
Let go!

629
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,200
I'm not going!

630
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:50,800
Let go!

631
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,560
Let go of me! I'm not going with you!

632
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,040
Mother! Mother!

633
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,160
I'm not going!

634
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,880
Let go of me! Let go of me!

635
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,400
Husband! Husband! Mother! Mother!

636
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,520
Second Brother! Ask Second Brother to save me!

637
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,240
Mother!

638
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,360
Tingwei! Tingwei!

639
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,520
What's going on? What's going on?

640
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,360
I don't know!

641
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,120
Mother-in-law, please save him!

642
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,880
He still is alive.

643
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,480
Why are you wailing in grief?

644
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:30,800
Tell me,

645
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,840
in the Fourth and Fifth Houses

646
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,280
helping the rebel prince buy some women case,

647
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,360
is Tingwei

648
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,640
involved or not?

649
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,760
No.

650
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,640
Husband has always been a coward.

651
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,880
He only likes to eat and drink,

652
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,000
and never likes socializing.

653
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,240
How could he be involved in such a matter?

654
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,680
Then why did the patrol guards arrest him?

655
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,360
Could it be...

656
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,480
Before, the Fourth and Fifth House

657
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,640
gifted us two women.

658
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,125
Husband saw that they were quite beautiful

659
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:01,800
so he accepted them.

660
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,360
These two are indeed very pretty.

661
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,080
It's as if they were meticulously chosen.

662
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,760
Muddled!

663
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,440
How could you dare

664
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,480
take in such kind of women?

665
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,640
If they were clean,

666
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:13,775
those two from the Fourth and Fifth Houses

667
00:30:13,775 --> 00:30:14,025
would have kept them

668
00:30:14,025 --> 00:30:14,320
for their own enjoyment.

669
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,760
How could it even be your turn?

670
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,120
They

671
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,280
wanted to drag us down with them?

672
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,760
They've calculated it from the start.

673
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,480
If that rebel prince obtained the throne,

674
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,840
they are meritorious subjects.

675
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,240
It has nothing to do with Tingwei.

676
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,480
If he fails,

677
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,360
just with those two women,

678
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,160
it's enough to drag us down with them.

679
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,040
If we fall,

680
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,800
whether it's your duke father

681
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,280
or your older brother,

682
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,760
they all can't escape being implicated.

683
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,760
Since we can't escape,

684
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,280
we also can't just sit by and do nothing.

685
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,600
They are so ruthless.

686
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,000
How could husband endure

687
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,040
that kind of torture?

688
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,360
Mother-in-law,

689
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,440
I beg you

690
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,040
to save him,

691
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:11,800
mother-in-law.

692
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,560
Mother-in-law, I'm begging you.

693
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,720
Save my husband.

694
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,840
Big Madam, could this invitation by the Gu Family

695
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,320
be a Hongmen Banquet?

696
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,720
Xiaotao, you've improved.

697
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,080
You even know how to use

698
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:31,840
the classical quotation 'Hongmen Banquet'.

699
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,400
This is strange, Miss.

700
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,080
They are the ones begging us,

701
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,080
so why should we go to the marquis house?

702
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,240
Shouldn't they be

703
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,600
coming to our manor

704
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,840
with gifts and courtesy?

705
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,925
If the people in the marquis house

706
00:31:45,925 --> 00:31:46,560
understood this,

707
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,000
then the case of rebelling

708
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,280
wouldn't have dragged on till now.

709
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,480
That's true.

710
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,760
If it were me,

711
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,120
having bullied and cast out

712
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,320
by the entire lot back then like that.

713
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,640
I wouldn't even acknowledge them now.

714
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,120
My husband won't ignore.

715
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,000
But he will have his condition, that's all.

716
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,000
Second Brother, I beg you.

717
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,160
Tingwei is always thinking of you.

718
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,200
I don't know

719
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,400
how is he

720
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,600
in that hell these last few days.

721
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,200
I beg you.

722
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,440
Sister-in-law, no need to worry.

723
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,720
It's not a grave crime.

724
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,160
At worst, he will be found as

725
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,200
having committed carelessness and social-climbing.

726
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,640
His head won't drop.

727
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,520
Then?

728
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,960
Would he be banished to serve in the army?

729
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,240
Well.

730
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,480
that will depend on how many crimes

731
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,680
he is found.

732
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,080
It must be your house!

733
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,960
Yelling names in the jail!

734
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,720
You made my husband got implicated,

735
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,280
I will kill you!

736
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,680
You already took in the people

737
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:19,960
and reaped the benefit.

738
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,120
Now you say

739
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,440
that your house isn't part of it?

740
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,800
If it hadn't been your instigating,

741
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,440
he's been so clean all these years

742
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,360
and why would he

743
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,720
suddenly take in two concubines?

744
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,680
Stop making others laugh.

745
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,960
If something happens to my man,

746
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,560
I will go to His Majesty and personally

747
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,520
expose your bottom line!

748
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,075
And I will fight til the fish are dead

749
00:33:36,075 --> 00:33:36,400
and the net is broken,

750
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,280
and no one will be clean then!

751
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,360
Don't think you can be clean then!

752
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,440
I only ask you one question.

753
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,400
By your

754
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,760
capacity and power today,

755
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,640
if you insist on trying to pull Gu family out,

756
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,960
can you accomplish it?

757
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,120
That's more proper.

758
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,680
Instead of push and pulling here

759
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,760
and pointing fingers indirectly,

760
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,720
it's better to get to the main point.

761
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,240
It's might be very difficult.

762
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,120
Having to beg in all directions

763
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,360
and plead for favors.

764
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,375
You may even need to

765
00:34:47,375 --> 00:34:48,480
make your plea to His Majesty.

766
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,000
But you can accomplish it,

767
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,160
is that right?

768
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,960
Correct. I can.

769
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,320
What does it take for you

770
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,400
to be willing to save Gu Family?

771
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,320
I'm not saving the Gu Family,

772
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,520
I am saving you guys.

773
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:12,960
Alright.

774
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,480
It's to save us.

775
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,400
Speak your conditions.

776
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,480
Is it my life or is it someone else's life?

777
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,800
Why would I want Big Brother's life?

778
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,280
Then what do you want exactly?

779
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,720
I want you,

780
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,600
as the marquis of Gu House,

781
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,080
to add another story to the clan register.

782
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,000
List the details of my mother, Lady Bai,

783
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,040
marrying into Gu House.

784
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,200
And announce

785
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,640
to the entire clan

786
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,840
how she saved the Gu Family.

787
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,800
Embellish her into the shrine with a name tablet,

788
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,440
and return justice to her.

789
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,880
Even if I am dead,

790
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,000
you can't get it!

791
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,240
First Gu.

792
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,440
Nanny Xiang, you may leave too.

793
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,800
Other than consenting to him,

794
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,560
we have no other way.

795
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,320
We can only do so now.

796
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,000
I'll make the trip myself

797
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,400
and pull out this old face.

798
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,920
I'll say we were all

799
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,440
too emotional earlier.

800
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,080
Didn't consider that much.

801
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,000
I'll apologize.

802
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,920
And this matter will pass.

803
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,480
Apologize?

804
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,400
All these years,

805
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,800
and all these compromises and resentments.

806
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,800
How do you apologize for it

807
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,240
so he can let it go?

808
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,480
First son, look.

809
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,320
He's not asking for much.

810
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,840
Though the matter

811
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,400
is a bit embarrassing.

812
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,920
It benefits us without costing us.

813
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,640
If this time

814
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,920
we lower our head to him,

815
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,280
from now on,

816
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,000
we will be at his full disposal.

817
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,500
Today is to set the legacy of Bai

818
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,060
in the clan register.

819
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,680
Tomorrow might ask

820
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,880
fourth and fifth house to get out off this house.

821
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,600
out of the marquis manor.

822
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,800
This is why ....

823
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,040
You can't talk like that.

824
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,000
Then you don't care about your brother?

825
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:05,640
Mother.

826
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,680
You raised him for so long.

827
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,520
Why do you never understand?

828
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,160
No matter how scary his words are,

829
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,440
he can't pull the final draw.

830
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,560
As long as we can keep standing,

831
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,800
he will go and speak for us in the end.

832
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,975
Everyone speaks of the glorious sepal palace

833
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:12,960
of the splendid Tang Dynasty.

834
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,600
We don't have that luck to try it.

835
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,760
But I think

836
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,080
the delicious food of Fan House,

837
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,560
are the true rarity of the world.

838
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,720
Do you think

839
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,160
I am too oppressing too?

840
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,800
When I was at Gu House,

841
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,360
you kept

842
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,680
either giving me the eye

843
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,800
or a pull on my clothing.

844
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,920
I was afraid a discord in words could happen,

845
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,360
and a fight would break out,

846
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,640
while they are the crowd.

847
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,440
And you and I would suffer a loss.

848
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,675
Bind that whole lot together

849
00:39:50,675 --> 00:39:51,635
and they still can't beat me.

850
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,800
I don't think so.

851
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,320
Your eldest brother alone

852
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,400
is enough to fight you.

853
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,760
What do you mean?

854
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,800
Your eldest brother.

855
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,650
He already knew you wouldn't be

856
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:11,640
so cruel and cold-hearted.

857
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,160
He knew you wouldn't attack your own brother

858
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:14,920
and clansmen

859
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,480
and that's why stood his ground firmly.

860
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,960
I'm not afraid of killing

861
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,320
or dead bodies.

862
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,560
But that is all in the battlefield.

863
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,760
But we're at home now.

864
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,350
I had thought the misfortune ended

865
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:43,040
and out came the bliss.

866
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,000
That I could finally shake off the marquis house

867
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,280
and live my own life.

868
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,640
But I didn't imagine, I still can't.

869
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,040
What I promised you

870
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,840
wasn't achieved either.

871
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,640
I don't blame you though,

872
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,480
since they are your clan.

873
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,760
Actually Prince Huan

874
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,560
already told me in advance.

875
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,560
Those people in fourth and fifth house,

876
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,720
didn't really commit any grave crimes.

877
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,840
It's just a mater of being sent to exile.

878
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,040
Whether it's getting exiled

879
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,000
to 800 or 3000 miles away,

880
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,520
that's something that can be negotiated too.

881
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,040
As for that third brother of mine,

882
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,640
he's not committed any grave offense either.

883
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,520
He's definitely going to be alright.

884
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,160
But I am just not content.

885
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,320
My mother back then,

886
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,000
saved the Gu Family, like water for fire.

887
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,360
But now,

888
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,920
those people can actually

889
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,120
lay atop of my mother's deceased bones

890
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,520
and live in luxury.

891
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,040
Even if I were to throw a stone

892
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,760
into the water,

893
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,050
it will at least splatter some water

894
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:11,600
back out to me.

895
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,120
My mother, back then,

896
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,440
she married into the Gu House

897
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,640
with full joy and bliss.

898
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:22,960
When she died,

899
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,040
it was so soundless and without care.

900
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,840
I'mafraid in this entire capital,

901
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,720
not many even know

902
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,560
that my mother

903
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,720
even existed!

904
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,960
Now if

905
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,880
I hadn't enjoy this glory,

906
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,600
I'm afraid they

907
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,200
would have thrown out my mother's tablet

908
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,560
from the shrine long ago.

909
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,880
I just can't swallow this anger.
