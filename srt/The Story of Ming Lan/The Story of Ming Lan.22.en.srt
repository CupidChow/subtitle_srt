00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,922
Episode 22

3
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,700
You said you were wrong?

4
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,600
Then how were you wrong?

5
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,800
Let me hear it.

6
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,000
Second Brother has always been so good to me.

7
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:26,050
I shouldn't have manipulated him.

8
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:32,900
By doing so, I am no different from the one in Linqi Pavilion.

9
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,295
I fear that my mother, upon knowing this

10
00:01:36,295 --> 00:01:38,800
from the underworld, she would scold me.

11
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,400
And you're not scared I might scold you?

12
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,300
Of course I fear that.

13
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,400
But you're right by me.

14
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,910
If you scold me, I would actually

15
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,500
be happy and relieved.

16
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,000
Let me ask you this.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,914
If Changbai were your brother

18
00:01:55,914 --> 00:01:58,700
by the same natural mother, would you have?

19
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,600
In that case, he would protect me.

20
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,000
If you were given birth to by Big Madam,

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,800
or given birth to by Mistress Lin?

22
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,800
Then...then...

23
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,312
Either Big Madam grasps the entire family authority

24
00:02:15,312 --> 00:02:16,800
and no one dares to incite me,

25
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,649
or Mistress Lin would be making

26
00:02:18,649 --> 00:02:20,300
cunning sharp plans for me,

27
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,900
and I'd have nothing to do myself!

28
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,400
Then how were you wrong?

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,100
I taught you for such a long time,

30
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,900
and you can't figure out why I'm angry at you?

31
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,000
Such a minor incident.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,598
It has you rolling back and forth nightly,

33
00:02:38,598 --> 00:02:40,000
unable to sleep?

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,888
Look at that small face of yours.

35
00:02:42,888 --> 00:02:44,400
It's gone haggard.

36
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,700
Grandmother, you...?

37
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,600
Your real brother. Your real mother.

38
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,600
Your husband and your own children in the future.

39
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,600
In the end, no one will be with you forever.

40
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,630
Your own life.

41
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,100
It's how you yourself will come and go.

42
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,700
Your calculation was great today.

43
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,458
Let me ask you. In another instance,

44
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,000
would you do it?

45
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,500
I would.

46
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,400
You must do it!

47
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,300
Do it, and that's how you can survive.

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,343
In two days, it will be your

49
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:40,000
Second Brother's wedding banquet.

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,200
Big Madam has done a great job planning it.

51
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,887
On that day, there will be style

52
00:03:45,887 --> 00:03:48,000
and there will be honor.

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,300
After that day passes,

54
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:56,800
you'll know where you will live in the future.

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,800
Congratulations.

56
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,700
Uncle Sheng.

57
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,500
Mother.

58
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,400
Come, this way.

59
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,400
We had the servants decorate all this.

60
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,400
We've embarrassed ourselves.

61
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,500
Let's go to the main hall and sit.

62
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,800
In terms of diligence, our rascal tops that,

63
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,200
but all for foolish diligence.

64
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,734
Unlike your family.

65
00:04:56,734 --> 00:04:59,000
Not only do you have two sons,

66
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,097
you have all these girls too.

67
00:05:01,097 --> 00:05:03,200
Each so charming and pretty.

68
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,975
I heard the Eldest Miss who's married into

69
00:05:05,975 --> 00:05:08,800
Count of Zhongqin's manor is pregnant too?

70
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,900
Yes. So I didn't call her to come.

71
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,000
It's better to nurse her pregnancy in the manor.

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,900
That Count manor...

73
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,300
It's a blessing to the whole family then.

74
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,000
Though it's said to have more children

75
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,200
is to have more blessings,

76
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,000
we are not a farmstead house, after all,

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,025
depending on the men for labor

78
00:05:27,025 --> 00:05:29,200
and to fight over the water supply.

79
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,800
As it's said, you don't need a lot of children

80
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,600
if you have a good one.

81
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Someone like your Young Lord, such a success!

82
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,900
One is plenty.

83
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,100
If they are not successful,

84
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,800
having more becomes more headaches.

85
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,200
Old Madam, you strike the point there.

86
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,600
Our Heng'er is a bit foolish.

87
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,075
But he's a noble child

88
00:05:51,075 --> 00:05:53,200
and we can say he's not worried us.

89
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,175
If he were like that unfilial thing,

90
00:05:56,175 --> 00:05:58,300
the Second Son of Gu House,

91
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,725
insisting on pulling in

92
00:05:59,725 --> 00:06:01,800
some unworthy woman into the house,

93
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,300
I would die from fury then.

94
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,000
Go. Call Young Master Heng here,

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,900
to thank Old Madam for praising him.

96
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,800
Yes.

97
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,550
This is the main daughter

98
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,980
of the Big Madam, I imagine?

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,900
She looks like you.

100
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,925
Look at that smile on the tip

101
00:06:29,925 --> 00:06:32,200
of her mouth and the sharp brows.

102
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,300
She surely posseses the air of a grand house.

103
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,075
You've praised me, Princess,

104
00:06:40,075 --> 00:06:42,100
and I, Rulan, feel guilty to accept it.

105
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,000
Greetings to Old Madam.

106
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,400
Peace to Mother.

107
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,600
Peace to Big Madam.

108
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,200
To all of the little sisters, good health.

109
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,000
Have a seat.

110
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,700
Thank you, Old Madam.

111
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,450
Speaking of being well,

112
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:21,900
I think having a son is no fun in that.

113
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,400
No one to help me pick out some rouge or perfume.

114
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,200
I just begrudge myself for not bearing a daughter.

115
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:36,100
Big Madam, I see you have more than one daughter.

116
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,025
You also have the Fourth Miss and Sixth Miss,

117
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:41,300
each so lovely.

118
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,900
Heng'er.

119
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,300
Mother.

120
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,390
What do you wish to say?

121
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,200
Don't you always complain,

122
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,000
that others have little sisters but only you don't.

123
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,600
Today, how about you regarding these Sheng sisters

124
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,600
as your own real sisters then?

125
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,410
Real sisters?

126
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,170
What do you mean, "real sisters"?

127
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,500
Your Highness, I fear you're drunk?

128
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,300
Our humble little girls,

129
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,720
how can they be the Young Lord's real sisters?

130
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,250
This humble girl is not so lucky

131
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,200
and I don't think I can overreach.

132
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,300
Mother. I fear you're really drunk.

133
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,800
Let me escort you to the guest room to rest.

134
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,900
Yes, the guest room is ready.

135
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,800
I've not even had anything. Drunk from what?

136
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,300
I've already brought the presents for it.

137
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,850
This kind of southern pearls.

138
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,200
Heng'er loves these the most.

139
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,650
I thought I'd bring these here today

140
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,200
as gifts to his sisters.

141
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,500
They are most befitting.

142
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,125
Heng'er, you go and gift then

143
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:14,000
to your sisters personally then.

144
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,100
This Sixth Miss is the only one that I've raised.

145
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,300
She's the only one who doesn't have a full brother.

146
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,000
If she can gain the Young Lord as her older brother,

147
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,500
that is a true honor.

148
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,325
Thank you, Your Highness and Young Lord,

149
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:46,280
for your pity.

150
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,020
I, Minglan, am so unworthy of this honor.

151
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,000
Elder Brother, please accept my greeting.

152
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,100
Eat slower, Miss, since it's scalding hot.

153
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,700
It's good.

154
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,200
Banquets are annoying.

155
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,275
You can't get full on it.

156
00:11:03,275 --> 00:11:04,900
You're hungry as soon as you're back.

157
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,200
But the happy thing is,

158
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,400
I got a string of very nice pearls.

159
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,300
Yes, it's so pretty on you.

160
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,400
But,

161
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,300
I'm the main daughter, so that's fine.

162
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,925
But how come the two concubine-born daughters

163
00:11:20,925 --> 00:11:21,800
get the same as I did,

164
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,900
especially the one from the adjacent courtyard?

165
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,200
I get mad as soon as I see her!

166
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,600
The Princess was being cordial

167
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,800
to soothe everyone's pride.

168
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,700
Her Highness is very aware

169
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,650
who is the legitimate daughter

170
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:31,600
and who are the concubine-born.

171
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:36,400
The Princess is so clear-minded.

172
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,750
She talks about making them brother and sisters

173
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,400
as soon as she arrives,

174
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,940
and jams any future for the girls at one stroke.

175
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,500
Looking down at our house is one thing.

176
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,800
But her manner of saying it

177
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,400
was kind of insulting to our girls.

178
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,200
Who cares about being siblings with her son?

179
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,400
Maybe in the future, in marriage talks,

180
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,675
we can say our daughter is

181
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,200
one acknowledged by Duke Qi Manor.

182
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,700
That might raise the sight too.

183
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,400
Wake up now.

184
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,900
Is it so easy to be relatives with her?

185
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,000
The Princess might have a strong temper,

186
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,100
but she's the most careful of all.

187
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,525
Guarding the ducal and royal princess titles

188
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,200
and the fondness of the palace,

189
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,400
she is one and only in the capital, you can say.

190
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,450
Have you ever seen her family

191
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,000
get into any muddied water?

192
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,400
Thankfully our Miss is most generous-minded.

193
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,170
She got a string of pearls and was so happy.

194
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,000
That's true.

195
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,336
I think our Fifth Miss

196
00:12:35,336 --> 00:12:37,500
isn't attached to that Young Lord.

197
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,200
Did you see Molan's face though?

198
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,100
She really wanted to climb onto that

199
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,000
high branch of Duke Qi Manor?

200
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,500
Right now I just want to look into

201
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,200
Linqi Pavilion's window,

202
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,100
and see that face of Lin Qinshuang.

203
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,200
Is she asleep?

204
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,975
She's blown out the lamp,

205
00:13:03,975 --> 00:13:06,200
but I don't know if she's asleep.

206
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,200
I won't worry whether she sleeps or not.

207
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,250
She'll have to suffer the heartache for a while.

208
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,100
You all be careful and watch her closely.

209
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,300
Yes.

210
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,000
Watch the yard tight.

211
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,600
Don't let them come into her room at their whim.

212
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,000
Don't let them see through something

213
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,400
to gossip about.

214
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,200
We understand. Be assured, Old Madam.

215
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,500
I will be sure to watch this yard

216
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,400
so water can't seep in and needles can't prick.

217
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,300
Our Sixth Miss is like a fairy.

218
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,750
If you ask me, she could be married

219
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,900
even as a Princess Consort.

220
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,800
What nonsense is that? You're out of your mind.

221
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,600
The dragon serpent is born from the snake's womb.

222
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,400
Sixth Miss just didn't crawl out from a good belly.

223
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,600
What's the use of you saying all this now?

224
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,683
What's the use?

225
00:13:59,683 --> 00:14:03,400
Alright, alright. I was wrong.

226
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,699
Don't get mad. Don't.

227
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:07,232
I should've known.

228
00:14:07,232 --> 00:14:10,150
Qi Heng, that foolish child. How can he

229
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,000
persuade his mother, Princess Pingning?

230
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,800
I should've knocked sense into Minglan at one blow.

231
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,800
But I couldn't bear to.

232
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,400
She's so youthful.

233
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,150
I pity her that she takes each step

234
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,500
with care and bears it all.

235
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,025
Even if the Fourth and Fifth Misses

236
00:14:26,025 --> 00:14:27,300
sit on her head to bully her,

237
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,100
she'll only concede and retreat.

238
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,850
I thought if by chance

239
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:36,300
she and the Young Lord could be matched,

240
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,300
she'll have someone who dotes on her

241
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,600
sincerely in the future.

242
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,100
Who'd have thought. Who'd have thought!

243
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,250
I see through that the Young Lord

244
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,100
still dotes on the Sixth Miss.

245
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,275
It's really just that Princess

246
00:14:50,275 --> 00:14:53,000
and the ducal manor that are the issue.

247
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,025
If Qi House comes again babbling about

248
00:14:55,025 --> 00:14:56,800
"real sisters" or "real brother",

249
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,200
you get a big rod and beat them out!

250
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,700
Yes.

251
00:15:05,055 --> 00:15:08,400
I must get a good marriage match for Minglan,

252
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,600
so she can live at ease and in comfort.

253
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,400
She'll never have to walk on eggshells!

254
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,570
She won't have to calculate again.

255
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:43,800
Mother Xiaocui had Xiaotao come report earlier,

256
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,800
saying Sixth Miss catch a cold and a slight fever.

257
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,454
Fever?

258
00:15:49,454 --> 00:15:50,950
Don't fret, Old Madam.

259
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,600
I asked Xiaotao in detail.

260
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,400
I think it's not a real fever.

261
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,200
It might be that she cried too much last night,

262
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,450
and this morning her body was weak

263
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,000
and started to get warm.

264
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,400
Have they summoned a physician?

265
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,425
Not yet. They said Sixth Miss doesn't want to

266
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:09,000
cause alarm and wouldn't let them yet.

267
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,700
They still should get a physician.

268
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,725
We'll say she's been exhausted

269
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:17,000
from managing the house.

270
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,450
After the banquet ended,

271
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,400
she finally relaxed and got sick.

272
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,900
Yes.

273
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,175
Get that son of mine and have him

274
00:16:25,175 --> 00:16:27,000
accompany me for breakfast.

275
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,700
Yes.

276
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,200
Changbai's marriage, I'm really very content with it.

277
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,400
At the old homestead in Youyang,

278
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,500
the Eldest Son of the First House,

279
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,500
Changwu has sent an invitation for his wedding too.

280
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,070
He's about to get married too. Did you know?

281
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,325
I know. First House's Elder Brother Wei

282
00:16:52,325 --> 00:16:54,500
sent a letter to detail the matter.

283
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,800
That is a good family.

284
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,200
The children are all grown and they should

285
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,400
all get married and establish themselves.

286
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,400
We're old too.

287
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,900
Your energy and mind are clearer than before.

288
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,300
I am old indeed. I can see it myself

289
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,200
from the flower-petaled mirror.

290
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,400
The Old Madam of the First House is closest to me.

291
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,375
She's been ill for years

292
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,600
and doing not so great lately.

293
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,900
She misses me in the letter.

294
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,500
And me? I don't have many days left either.

295
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,500
So I'd like to go back and for a look,

296
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,600
and to pray at your Sheng House shrine too.

297
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,600
It should be done.

298
00:17:36,134 --> 00:17:37,450
Brother Wei and our family

299
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:38,800
have the closest connection.

300
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,600
I should go visit too.

301
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,100
You can't. You can't leave the palace these days.

302
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,100
Just who will His Majesty establish?

303
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,700
Changes can happen at any time.

304
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,250
You've been an official for years and

305
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,300
we can't have you go missing at the critical time.

306
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,800
That's putting all effort to vain then.

307
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,700
Mother is right.

308
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,000
Then let's have Changfeng accompany you.

309
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,900
That temperament of his?

310
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,600
It's ruined by his mother. He's inept and weak.

311
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,900
It'd be easier if I went alone in that case.

312
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,700
Then let's have Changbai go.

313
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,550
He's the Eldest Son of the Second House,

314
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,500
so that's most proper.

315
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,400
You're a father and how silly you are.

316
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,975
Changbai got married yesterday.

317
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,100
How can we tell him to go?

318
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,780
I'll ask Minglan from you then.

319
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,475
MInglan is great too.

320
00:18:30,475 --> 00:18:32,200
The Sixth Girl is level-headed.

321
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,425
And she's close to you,

322
00:18:33,425 --> 00:18:35,400
so it's easy to talk to her on the way.

323
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,300
Not only for that.

324
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,575
Sixth Miss is managing the house

325
00:18:39,575 --> 00:18:41,300
but it's only a temporary chore.

326
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,950
Big Madam committed an error,

327
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,100
and it's enough punishment up to now.

328
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,250
Changbai's bride just came into the house and

329
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,500
we can't have her see her Mother-in-law as a joke.

330
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,225
So we'll have Six Granddaughter come with me,

331
00:18:51,225 --> 00:18:52,200
and the house management,

332
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,075
we'll return it to the Big Madam

333
00:18:54,075 --> 00:18:56,700
so that it's respectful of everyone.

334
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,700
You are so thorough in all aspects, Mother.

335
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,100
Alright.

336
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:08,800
Finish up, and go see the new bride.

337
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,300
Yes.

338
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,000
I, your son Changbai, greet Father and Mother.

339
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,425
I, your daughter-in-law, Hai Zhaoyun,

340
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:21,100
greets Father and Mother.

341
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,900
Have a seat.

342
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,800
Sit, sit.

343
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,300
Zhaoyun, since you're married into our family

344
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,700
and became our daughter-in-law,

345
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,800
you should know all the rules.

346
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,000
Your daughter-in-law is aware.

347
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,100
When your mother-in-law is speaking,

348
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,000
don't jump in.

349
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,400
Yes, please speak, Mother.

350
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,200
We need you to have children.

351
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,750
Listen to teaching in morning and at night.

352
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,900
Serve your in-laws.

353
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,250
Assist your husband.

354
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,560
You can't languish in any of those.

355
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,375
We are husband and wife but together

356
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,200
in one body, each holding up their duties

357
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,800
in order to have a peaceful family.

358
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,500
I can't take my new bride's place to give birth.

359
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,025
So my new bride doesn't need to take up

360
00:20:15,025 --> 00:20:17,000
the burden of my future either.

361
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,000
I...

362
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:31,400
Your Hai family is an honest family for generations.

363
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,375
To have a daughter-in-law like you

364
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,600
is our Sheng family's luck.

365
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,300
Right?

366
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,000
Your mother-in-law is right.

367
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,200
Everyone should do their own duty and not languish.

368
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,475
Your son shall remember.

369
00:20:48,475 --> 00:20:50,200
Your daughter-in-law shall remember.

370
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,600
Sit down, sit down!

371
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,400
Sit.

372
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,825
Miss Ru put on the pearls

373
00:21:21,825 --> 00:21:23,800
and made a few rounds first,

374
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,025
and showed herself pretty big

375
00:21:25,025 --> 00:21:26,400
with it at the poetry meeting too.

376
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,000
Later, Miss Mo wore them too.

377
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,700
So Miss Ru put away the pearls,

378
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,420
she switched it to a gold locket chain.

379
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,900
Fifth girl's temper is like Big Madam's,

380
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,800
she has no subtlety.

381
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,975
She has no idea what it means

382
00:21:43,975 --> 00:21:45,800
to be brother and sister.

383
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,650
She just wants to fight with

384
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,400
the one in Linqi Pavilion.

385
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,190
The shady businesses in the house,

386
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,400
I fear she cannot handle them.

387
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,000
Who says it's not so.

388
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,800
Big Madam and legitimate daughter said nothing yet.

389
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,525
But the one raised by Mistress Lin in Linqi Pavilion

390
00:22:04,525 --> 00:22:06,300
already threw a fight at the Master,

391
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,350
asking the Master to go to Qi House

392
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,600
to talk to them more.

393
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,800
Master is beyond angry.

394
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,800
He just went out straight to Big Madam's to rest.

395
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,890
That son of mine. Luckily he's not always confused.

396
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:24,590
Who can blame the Linqi Pavilion though.

397
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,275
Young Lord's talent and family background,

398
00:22:28,275 --> 00:22:29,400
who isn't stirred?

399
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,500
But contrarily, he's fond of our Sixth Miss.

400
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:43,780
Grandmother, I'd like to discuss something with you.

401
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,020
Go ahead.

402
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:47,750
I took a look up on deck,

403
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,525
and I saw that there are other ships

404
00:22:50,525 --> 00:22:52,600
behind and in front of us.

405
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,650
I think maybe we should have Mother Fang

406
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:58,500
take Father and Second Brother's badges

407
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,630
and pay visits to those ships?

408
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,775
Telling them we're returning to the hometown too

409
00:23:02,775 --> 00:23:04,050
and we could travel together,

410
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,310
so we can watch out for each other on the way.

411
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,910
That's a great idea.

412
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:10,780
Go ahead then.

413
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,830
Grandmother, take this medicine soon,

414
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,980
so your dizziness can be better.

415
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,450
Are you still dizzy too?

416
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,990
Me?

417
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:34,400
This place has soaring skies, clear water,

418
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,470
and wide scenery, so I'm much better.

419
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:40,980
The scenery is open and wide. How about you?

420
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,600
I...

421
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:48,730
If a person lives stifled, it is not a fun life.

422
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,725
It's a perfect chance for me

423
00:23:50,725 --> 00:23:52,690
to use this great scenery

424
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:56,300
to inspire and think, and my mind's more open now.

425
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,600
If you can think openly, then that's great.

426
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,300
When we're docked for my medicine later,

427
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,200
you get off the boat and eat.

428
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,850
Get your feet on the ground and you'll feel better.

429
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:10,800
It'll be perfect then. I can get some honey for you,

430
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,750
since you just can't finish your medicine.

431
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,170
Nonsense.

432
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:19,610
Yesterday, I sucked on a plum and ate the medicine.

433
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:21,870
Is that right?

434
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,410
You're so thorough, Miss.

435
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,875
I had them get me on a small boat

436
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:29,520
to give my greetings.

437
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,400
They are all wealthy official families

438
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,090
with lots of servants.

439
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:36,520
They were very cordial upon seeing our name.

440
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,890
They said we should just follow the group of boats

441
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:41,530
and we can watch out for each other.

442
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:44,160
Sixth Girl's scope of calculation

443
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,530
is just getting more and more tactful.

444
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:48,190
Not so.

445
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,240
Mother Fang, is there an issue?

446
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,910
Left side. The boat on the left side.

447
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:00,250
I went up and it was actually

448
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,670
the Young Lord of Duke Qi Manor.

449
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,200
I guess we're on the same route.

450
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,160
No need to worry, Mother Fang.

451
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:19,830
That boy by the Young Lord after I got on the boat,

452
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:22,390
he asked me to bring words to you

453
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,710
that he wants to talk to you, Miss,

454
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:27,240
and to apologize to Old Madam.

455
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:32,560
Mother Fang, h-have them go back.

456
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,725
That boy also said, the Young Lord

457
00:25:35,725 --> 00:25:37,670
only wants one conversation,

458
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,950
or else they will just follow us

459
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,430
all the way to Youyang

460
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:43,990
and greet the Sheng homestead.

461
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,375
What? He's acting like a rogue.

462
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:51,930
Mother Fang, tell them to leave.

463
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,950
They've already followed all the way here

464
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,010
and if not done talking,

465
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:58,160
how will he be willing to go?

466
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,217
What do we do then?

467
00:26:03,217 --> 00:26:06,460
We can't have them follow us all the way to Youyang.

468
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,570
Youthful and vigorous,

469
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:15,360
but it's a matter that can't be done.

470
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,180
What's the use of a thousand, ten thousand words?

471
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:26,180
When we're ashore, go see him.

472
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,943
Not like Old Madam of Yu House,

473
00:26:27,943 --> 00:26:32,550
raising Yanran as someone who can't handle anything,

474
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:36,050
a big event comes and she's shaking and fretting.

475
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:38,890
A person's life is full of ups and downs.

476
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:42,860
There will be lots more to come.

477
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:45,710
You can't hide from them.

478
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,130
Stop the carriage.

479
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:26,410
Go to the medicine shop.

480
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:05,620
I heard the Young Lord has something to say to me?

481
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:11,310
I...

482
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,790
I heard you were going back to Youyang.

483
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:19,350
I figured that you won't be back

484
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,950
for at least three to five months.

485
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,230
I...

486
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,770
After we parted that day, we've never met again.

487
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,020
In my heart...

488
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,670
I understand your difficulty.

489
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:40,350
I imagine our fate is shallow,

490
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,210
hence you needn't let it bother you.

491
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:44,390
No, no. I am bothered by it.

492
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,880
I am always thinking of you.

493
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:56,310
I told you my mother would come and propose marriage.

494
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:58,390
But I...

495
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,800
I never thought things would be like that.

496
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,980
I shouldn't speak ill of my mother behind her back,

497
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:12,720
but no matter what, you're the only one I will marry.

498
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,375
So you can go to Youyang in peace.

499
00:29:15,375 --> 00:29:16,380
When you come back,

500
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,630
there will be good news for sure.

501
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,725
The Young Lord's devotion,

502
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:23,030
I am very grateful for it...

503
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,250
but matters like this

504
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,830
are too difficult to achieve.

505
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:29,720
Young Lord, don't waste your energy now.

506
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,130
No, no.

507
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,250
I've always been the most docile

508
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:33,885
and more filial one

509
00:29:33,885 --> 00:29:36,500
in the titled manors of the capital.

510
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,580
Marrying you,

511
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,400
is the most sincere and

512
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,090
most ardent matter I wish to do.

513
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,570
I will beg my mother. When you return,

514
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:54,150
I will have the matchmaker come

515
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:55,920
and propose marriage at your home.

516
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,201
Her Highness has already visited my home.

517
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:05,390
I took the pearls and made my greeting.

518
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,680
You and I are brother and sister now.

519
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,960
Don't think too much anymore.

520
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,290
My status is low. If it gets out,

521
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:14,925
it will be hard for my sisters

522
00:30:14,925 --> 00:30:16,200
to keep their standing.

523
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,740
Young Lord, may you take good care of yourself.

524
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,780
Sixth Sister.

525
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,460
Wait.

526
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:43,810
I...when I was waiting on the ship.

527
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,320
I saw this.

528
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:50,075
I thought it was so cute,

529
00:30:50,075 --> 00:30:51,520
so I bought it.

530
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:54,650
You...you keep it by your side,

531
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:57,330
and look at it from time to time.

532
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:11,790
The other boy doll,

533
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:14,660
I already told Buwei to put it away carefully.

534
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:26,650
Why do you go to this trouble?

535
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:34,800
Young Lord, if there's nothing else,

536
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,480
my Miss will return now.

537
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,525
Young Lord, it'll be best you leave for your return

538
00:31:40,525 --> 00:31:42,680
to the capital for ease of everyone.

539
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:48,480
Safe travels. Safe travels, Young Lord.

540
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,850
Sixth Sister.

541
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,510
You always call me "Young Lord".

542
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,910
How about...

543
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:01,100
you call me "Yuanruo" once?

544
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,175
This wood doll looks so much

545
00:32:42,175 --> 00:32:43,800
like you when you smile.

546
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,900
Really?

547
00:32:44,977 --> 00:32:47,980
Look, it's the curved eyes.

548
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,991
Silly girl!

549
00:32:49,991 --> 00:32:52,151
Who doesn't have curved eyes when they smile?

550
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,850
Is the Young Lord not following us anymore?

551
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,675
The Young Lord said he would only marry you.

552
00:33:21,675 --> 00:33:22,630
Can he do it?

553
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,960
He said he can.

554
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,610
Then we'll trust him one more time.

555
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,100
Because you have me in your heart.

556
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:29,625
You're just afraid to acknowledge it.

557
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:31,080
You little liar.

558
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,775
No, I am bothered by it.

559
00:34:38,775 --> 00:34:40,580
I'm always thinking of you.

560
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,050
I

561
00:35:16,632 --> 00:35:18,760
What's wrong, Miss?

562
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,760
You've been crying?

563
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,740
Miss, don't cry now.

564
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:32,600
How about I make fried fish for you tomorrow?

565
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:38,020
Or let me sing you a little tune?

566
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:30,090
Run!

567
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:41,810
Miss!

568
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,850
Tell everyone to blow out all the candles.

569
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:58,075
Don't panic and don't move around.

570
00:36:58,075 --> 00:36:59,630
I'll go find Grandmother.

571
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,910
Careful, Miss.

572
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,490
Old Madam. Old Madam!

573
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,630
Wake up, Old Madam.

574
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,840
Hurry and wake up!

575
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:19,750
It's alright. Grandmother.

576
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,190
You can't, Sixth Miss.

577
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:23,494
Before she fell asleep she drank pacifying tonic,

578
00:37:23,494 --> 00:37:24,325
and she'll be half-asleep

579
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,570
no matter how you try to wake her.

580
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:27,660
Grandmother, hurry and wake up.

581
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,120
Grandmother.

582
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,790
This waterway has always been very peaceful.

583
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:33,970
I bet it's some minor bandits.

584
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:35,220
They won't stay long.

585
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,725
Sixth Miss. How about

586
00:37:36,725 --> 00:37:38,380
us gathering all the people,

587
00:37:38,398 --> 00:37:39,150
and everyone hiding in the cabin

588
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:39,958
and closing the door and windows,

589
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:42,810
and maybe it will be alright?

590
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:44,825
But what if they are an organized gang

591
00:37:44,825 --> 00:37:46,210
who kill without blinking?

592
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:50,240
We can't just leave our fate for survival to luck!

593
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,130
Then..?

594
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:52,525
I need to save Grandmother.

595
00:37:52,525 --> 00:37:53,860
We need to find a way to leave.

596
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,120
Grandmother. But the way Old Madam is,

597
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,240
where can we escape to?

598
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,890
Grandmother.

599
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:03,070
Grandmother, we need to get up now. Grandmother.

600
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:09,750
Old Madam, wake up.

601
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:12,800
Wake up, Old Madam.

602
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:32,440
We're in the Huaiyin area.

603
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,230
There should be a command battalion on shore.

604
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:38,260
If we can get ashore, we'll be safe.

605
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:42,300
River bandits? They just want money.

606
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,440
If we give them the stuff,

607
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,740
they won't kill us.

608
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,970
We...We'll abandon the ship.

609
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:50,150
Abandon the ship, leave it all?

610
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,250
Right! Leave all the things.

611
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,520
Minglan... Abandon it!

612
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:55,450
Ming Girl.

613
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:57,360
Grandmother.

614
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,200
Get up. Let's dress you.

615
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,190
Get up. Granddaughter Ming...

616
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:04,380
Shoes. Hurry.

617
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,550
Mother Fang, go find the boatman

618
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,230
and get some small flat boats.

619
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:11,360
I'll dress Grandmother.

620
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,790
Slowly.

621
00:39:16,276 --> 00:39:18,060
Take it slow.

622
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:28,750
Slowly, Old Madam.

623
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,500
Slowly.

624
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,940
Sixth Miss, this is the last one.

625
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:40,700
We only found one boat. You and Old Madam go.

626
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,500
We've troubled you.

627
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,450
We will thank you generously later. Alright.

628
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:45,340
Miss, what about you?

629
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,330
You go with Grandmother first. I'll come right after.

630
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:49,010
You can't.

631
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:51,960
Don't worry. Go, go.

632
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,450
No.

633
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:57,130
Miss. Miss. Miss.

634
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,640
What about us?

635
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,790
Ming'er. Ming'er.

636
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:09,840
Ming'er. It'll be alright, Old Madam.

637
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,600
What do we do?

638
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,525
You all see that there are river bandits

639
00:40:34,525 --> 00:40:35,360
causing a ruckus.

640
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,150
If you want to lure them here,

641
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,730
go ahead with the yelling!

642
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,725
They just want to rob us.

643
00:40:41,725 --> 00:40:43,720
But if we make a big deal of it

644
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,400
with people going to the shore seeking help,

645
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,350
when the command gets here,

646
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:49,070
they will run away wildly.

647
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:51,060
Everyone, hurry and return to the cabin first.

648
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,325
Put out the lights, close the door

649
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:54,950
hide, and survive this.

650
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:56,580
Hurry up!

651
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,230
Yes.

652
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,510
Search.

653
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:31,320
No!

654
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:50,190
Get up.

655
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:19,020
Is there anyone up there? Search, hurry up!

656
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,130
This way.

657
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:30,000
No. Not here. Get up.

658
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,070
Hurry.

659
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:42,720
Someone's here.

660
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,890
Search it!

661
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:45,390
Stop right there!

662
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:49,180
What other valuables are on the boat?

663
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,600
If you don't tell me, I'll cut you

664
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,930
and throw you to feed the fish!

665
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:53,430
Please spare me, my lord.

666
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:56,590
My old madam already ran away on the small boat.

667
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:58,750
I have nothing!

668
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,680
The girl's good looking enough.
