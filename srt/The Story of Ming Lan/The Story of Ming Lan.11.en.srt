1
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:03,080
Episode 11

2
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,599
Nanny Kong's lessons are finished

3
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:18,480
and I found that they were quite productive.

4
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:21,239
These last few days

5
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:22,559
the three children have shown progress

6
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:24,519
in prudence and composure of their conduct and speech.

7
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,279
That's good then.

8
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:29,360
It means I did not invite her in vain,

9
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,199
and the energy was not used in vain.

10
00:01:34,559 --> 00:01:35,599
The three girls are idling around

11
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:37,440
in the back courtyards.

12
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,279
Especially Molan.

13
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:41,519
That child is most fond of poetry and literature.

14
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,480
I am thinking,

15
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,959
perhaps we should have them continue

16
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:50,440
to attend Scholar Zhuang's classes.

17
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,760
Is this your idea…

18
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:57,319
or is someone pushing you from behind?

19
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,239
I just thought

20
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:02,040
for the children to study more books

21
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,080
and understand more principles of the world

22
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,680
is a good thing.

23
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,039
You go back.

24
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,839
Let me think it over a bit more.

25
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,720
Yes.

26
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,080
Come out now.

27
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,240
Stop eavesdropping!

28
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:36,160
How did you know I was eavesdropping?

29
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,039
You really want to return

30
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,919
to Scholar Zhuang's classes too, right?

31
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,800
Usually,

32
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,360
the sisters are idling together.

33
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:49,199
Today we fight over clothing

34
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,880
and tomorrow we fight over tea and food.

35
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:52,360
Troubles arise easily.

36
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,639
It's better for us to all wake up early

37
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:54,119
and go to sleep late

38
00:02:54,119 --> 00:02:56,320
to cultivate our writing and reading books.

39
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:57,679
With our energies exhausted

40
00:02:57,679 --> 00:02:58,960
there's nothing left to fight about.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,199
That's not untrue.

42
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:04,320
But studying books

43
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,479
is not the duty of women, after all.

44
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,199
Grandmother, if you say these words

45
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:15,559
your granddaughter must barge in here.

46
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:17,399
Go ahead.

47
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:22,240
You know what I think?

48
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,360
The saying that reading is useless is a lie.

49
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,160
If it's truly useless

50
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,880
why do all the men of the world rush to study?

51
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,199
Can it be out of boredom.

52
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,679
I think the saying was

53
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,080
simply an aspiration of men,

54
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,559
wanting women to be

55
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:37,720
fools and docile forever,

56
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,919
so as to be easily manipulated by them.

57
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,559
I just knew you're a little clever thing

58
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:44,960
and would understand it!

59
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,160
That's not a false statement.

60
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,240
Not wanting women to study books

61
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,279
is short-sighted.

62
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,199
Dynasties and generations

63
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,000
of women of great aristocrats,

64
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:54,880
which one

65
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,720
isn't versed in books and principles since youth?

66
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,440
If it's true that it's useless for women to study,

67
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,080
then will they let their daughters

68
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,440
go through that suffering?

69
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,399
Then Grandmother,

70
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:07,839
your indecisiveness before Father earlier,

71
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:09,240
it was fake too?

72
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,119
You want Mistress Lin and Fourth Sister

73
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,800
to fret for a few days?

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,679
I want

75
00:04:17,679 --> 00:04:19,200
the mother and daughter to know

76
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,279
that returning to the home academy

77
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,320
is an opportunity not easily earned,

78
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,440
so they know their place.

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,760
The Imperial civil service exam is approaching.

80
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,720
Everyone.

81
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,600
It's time to test your skills in earnest then.

82
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:41,959
Today, I will use this

83
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:43,480
”Sayings of Confucius and His Disciples”

84
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,359
as the foundation.

85
00:04:45,679 --> 00:04:46,959
I'll just flip it through carelessly

86
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:47,640
and point to a line

87
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:50,679
and we can use it

88
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:51,760
as the topic of our discussion.

89
00:05:07,799 --> 00:05:09,040
How appropriate.

90
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,239
Everyone, listen.

91
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,640
Today's debate topic is . . .

92
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:20,760
”To establish the eldest heir or to establish the most qualified heir,

93
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,799
which is better?”

94
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,119
It's appropriate indeed.

95
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:31,160
The hottest topic in the capital these days,

96
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:34,640
is the succession battle

97
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,559
between Prince Yan and Prince Yong.

98
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,160
Scholar.

99
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,440
I fear this topic isn't appropriate.

100
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:45,440
Not to worry.

101
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,399
Even an ordinary tea house in the capital

102
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,000
often discusses about this

103
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,480
as of late.

104
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:53,679
With our doors closed and talking about it furtively,

105
00:05:53,679 --> 00:05:54,799
it's no worry.

106
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,880
As long as

107
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,359
you all do not leak it out?

108
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,000
Since Scholar says it's no worry,

109
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,239
let us discuss it then.

110
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,559
The current Emperor has no sons.

111
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,239
The high ministers are all urging His Majesty

112
00:06:16,239 --> 00:06:17,000
to adopt from the Imperial clan

113
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,760
and appoint him as the crown prince.

114
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:21,559
Prince Yong is older but his qualifications are mediocre

115
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:22,440
with no achievements to speak of.

116
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,519
His only asset is that

117
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,799
he's got a horde of wife and concubines

118
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:27,359
serving him day and night!

119
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:29,320
He's exhausted himself from it

120
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,040
and raised a whole yard full of daughters and sons.

121
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,440
Second Brother. Watch your words.

122
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,480
We've got maidens here.

123
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:43,799
Prince Yong is older

124
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:44,679
and he has lots of children,

125
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,920
so it's appropriate to select him.

126
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,519
What's there to battle about?

127
00:06:49,679 --> 00:06:52,839
Prince Yan is only half a year younger than Prince Yong.

128
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:54,799
Though Prince Yan only has one son,

129
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,760
the father and son

130
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,959
are both intelligent and capable,

131
00:06:57,359 --> 00:06:58,399
and very much admired by people.

132
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,880
To set a sage man like him as heir to the throne

133
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,480
will be a great consideration for the nation's future.

134
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,040
Half a year younger is still younger.

135
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,040
We can't surpass the order of seniority in age.

136
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:11,320
It is not right, and it is not proper.

137
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,920
If everyone cares about talent only

138
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,320
then maybe it's possible.

139
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:16,279
But everyone cares about

140
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:18,040
ranking and stations.

141
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:20,320
So that becomes a matter.

142
00:07:20,359 --> 00:07:21,839
Second Brother, you speak so easily.

143
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,239
This is the Imperial throne.

144
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,720
We're not talking about small households

145
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,640
fighting over a plot of land or a shop.

146
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,440
If we don't get the status clear,

147
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,359
that's causing chaos.

148
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,200
Changbai, what do you think?

149
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,799
Sir.

150
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,760
Your disciple thinks the main eldest should be established.

151
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:48,320
Emperor Qin deposed

152
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,079
his eldest son Fusu.

153
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:51,519
It resulted in Qin Dynasty's collapse in its second generation.

154
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,320
Looking at the ancient times,

155
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,000
so many dynasties getting replaced.

156
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,559
So many met troubles after establishment of

157
00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:58,720
deposing the elder in favor of the younger.

158
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,000
That's not really true.

159
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,160
Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty

160
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,640
wasn't the eldest, but after succeeding the throne,

161
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:07,239
he was able to establish a flourishing nation

162
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:08,200
and army that annihilated the fierce nomads,

163
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:09,920
a lifetime of achievements.

164
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,160
So it shows it's not necessarily a bad thing

165
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,239
not to select the eldest.

166
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,359
But before Emperor Jing established Liu Che as the crown prince,

167
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,640
he first raised the birth mother

168
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,959
the beautiful Lady Wang, as the next empress.

169
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,079
So by law, it was just and proper.

170
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,000
So you can see,

171
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Liu Che's ascending to the throne

172
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,959
is actually an example of selecting the main heir.

173
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:28,279
Don't forget, Second Uncle.

174
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,760
Emperor Hui of Jin,

175
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,440
the entire court knew he was a fool.

176
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,919
But because he was the main eldest, he was still selected.

177
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:36,159
And that is how the later conspiring of Empress Jia Nanfeng

178
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,760
and the rebellion of the eight princes came about.

179
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,559
If another prince had been selected to succeed him in the first place,

180
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,119
it wouldn't lead to the retreating to Jiangnan.

181
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,679
How many idiots like

182
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:47,799
Emperor Hui of Jin exist though?

183
00:08:48,239 --> 00:08:49,960
Do you think, Fourth Sister,

184
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:51,640
that all the main line

185
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,640
of children are fools?

186
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,479
Just because the eldest

187
00:08:54,479 --> 00:08:55,400
from the main line isn't a fool

188
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,599
doesn't mean the second son

189
00:08:56,599 --> 00:08:57,919
can't be smart and clever.

190
00:08:58,719 --> 00:09:00,119
Emperor Taizong of Tang was not the eldest son of the main line,

191
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,039
but he still built a flourishing era.

192
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:03,239
Examples of the younger son ruining the nation

193
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:04,679
with his absurdness are many too.

194
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,679
Emperor Yang of Sui is one.

195
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,440
He ruined a great nation

196
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,520
and that's common knowledge.

197
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,119
After listening all this time,

198
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:14,359
why did the Young Lord and Sixth Miss

199
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:15,840
not say a word?

200
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,840
Your disciple has yet

201
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,119
to make up his mind.

202
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,359
Yuanruo is the sole son of his family.

203
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,159
On the matter of selecting by age

204
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,080
or selecting by merits,

205
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,200
perhaps he can't fathom it clearly.

206
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,479
That is indeed so.

207
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,039
I think

208
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,799
it's best to hear other people's great thoughts first.

209
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,640
Sixth Miss,

210
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,719
selecting by elder or by merit.

211
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:43,719
What is your thought?

212
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,559
I am just a girl.

213
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:51,039
I've never thought of it.

214
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,520
Just leave the nation policy aside.

215
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,840
Let's just say, hypothetically,

216
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,359
a small household,

217
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:58,239
they have a useless elder son and a clever

218
00:09:58,239 --> 00:09:59,799
and skilled son from a concubine.

219
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,000
Which should be the housemaster?

220
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:04,280
That's something the family master

221
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,400
needs to toil over.

222
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:06,919
it is not convenient for me to speak wildly.

223
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:09,000
Third Brother,

224
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,200
how do you now the eldest must be mediocre?

225
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,119
Maybe the concubine-born son

226
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:14,200
is just a hollow embroidered pillow!

227
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,599
The second son being hollow

228
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,280
doesn't mean the eldest isn't mediocre.

229
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:18,159
You!

230
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,359
I'm asking the Sixth Sister,

231
00:10:19,359 --> 00:10:20,520
why are you two arguing?

232
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,919
Sixth Sister, you speak.

233
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:25,239
I don't know what to say.

234
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:27,840
You must say something.

235
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,119
Say it.

236
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:32,320
Let's not be hard on Sixth Sister.

237
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,640
She's young.

238
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,280
And she is not preparing for the Imperial civil exam,

239
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,760
so this topic doesn't have much to do with her.

240
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,080
Why should we press someone?

241
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:41,200
I think,

242
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,359
we should hear out Sixth Miss' thoughts.

243
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,080
Though she is young

244
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,280
and she's not inclined to speak,

245
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,119
it's possible she might be wise

246
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:49,880
and already made up her mind.

247
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,200
it's possible she might be wise and already made up her mind.

248
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,479
She's just watching us argue until our faces are red

249
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:55,119
and laughing at us secretly.

250
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:57,400
Uncle Gu, if you want to speak, just speak.

251
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,520
Why must you draw me into it?

252
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:01,000
Second Uncle.

253
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,239
Why do you press her too?

254
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,559
The more you try to protect that little one,

255
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,080
the more the two elder sisters will bicker.

256
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,400
So let her handle it.

257
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,799
I think she can handle it.

258
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,400
No.

259
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:17,919
You don't know. Here.

260
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,599
In this house.

261
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:22,919
She can't.

262
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,239
Very well. Everyone has spoken.

263
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,760
Sixth Miss, you should talk too.

264
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,599
He's calling you. He wants you to talk.

265
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,039
Hurry.

266
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:49,479
Actually I want to ask

267
00:11:49,479 --> 00:11:51,119
Young Lord and Second Uncle Gu.

268
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,039
I am here. Just ask me.

269
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,000
You two are both the legitimate heirs of your homes.

270
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,760
In discussing legitimate and concubine-born,

271
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,280
perhaps you both can speak

272
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,679
more freely than we siblings.

273
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,440
But today,

274
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,679
what I wish to ask is

275
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:12,359
if both of you were to have

276
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,919
a very accomplished sibling who is concubine-born,

277
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,840
how would you place yourselves?

278
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:19,640
Who cares if it's legitimate or concubine birth?

279
00:12:20,479 --> 00:12:22,679
If the concubine-born son is talented

280
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:24,400
and proper in conduct,

281
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,400
that's a good thing.

282
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,039
And what if

283
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,000
this talented and upright concubine-born brother

284
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:30,200
wishes to fight for the nobility title with you?

285
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,000
If we talk about legitimate and concubine-born

286
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,239
in terms of eldest to youngest,

287
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,400
in my family, the eldest is my older brother

288
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,039
and I'm the second.

289
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,919
If my third brother is better than I am,

290
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,640
than of course

291
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,000
he should inherit the title.

292
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:54,119
Second Uncle, your words are in error.

293
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,679
Your youngest brother is still from the legitimate wife

294
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:57,640
so that doesn't count.

295
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,400
A clan's succession of legacy

296
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,440
is not a joke.

297
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,000
Your indifference to name and fortune is a small matter

298
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,440
and you'd let the concubine-born inherit the noble title.

299
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,960
But you will bring shame to

300
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,840
your ancestors and clansman.

301
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:09,919
Shame?

302
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:13,440
If the concubine-born is talented and virtuous,

303
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,119
he will accomplish great things,

304
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:16,320
bringing honor and glory to the clan and the ancestors.

305
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:19,239
If the legitimate heir is useless and lacking in virtue

306
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:20,119
and he squanders off the family assets,

307
00:13:20,479 --> 00:13:22,719
the ancestors will see some honor then?

308
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,080
If the concubine-born is talented

309
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,320
he should just assist the legitimate son.

310
00:13:25,719 --> 00:13:27,080
There's no need to upset the order

311
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,479
and isn't that a perfect solution?

312
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,840
Young Lord.

313
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,359
You regard human nature too high.

314
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,840
A talented man will surely be prideful.

315
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,239
He will not submit as an underling.

316
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,159
According to your saying,

317
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,719
it will only court absolute division and discord between the brothers.

318
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,239
I fear by then

319
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:41,479
the noble title will be lost too.

320
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,159
Many in our time like to

321
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,200
discuss success with achievements.

322
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,719
And that's what's stirred the concubine-born

323
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,960
to hold foolish delusions.

324
00:13:53,359 --> 00:13:54,559
If everyone in the world can

325
00:13:54,599 --> 00:13:56,200
respect status and etiquette,

326
00:13:56,359 --> 00:13:58,440
have division in seniority and honor the legitimate elder,

327
00:13:58,599 --> 00:14:02,239
then how can division between brothers and collapse of families even occur?

328
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:07,559
If Yuanruo truly believes that,

329
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:10,719
I must urge you to do a lot of good acts.

330
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,440
So you won't be reborn as a concubine-born in your next life

331
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,960
and suffer endless bitterness.

332
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,280
We are discussing for amusement,

333
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,440
so everyone should be friendly.

334
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,760
Sixth Miss,

335
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,440
you had the two Young Masters talk so much.

336
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,760
Have you not set your conclusion

337
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:30,000
as to whether to establish by seniority or by merit?

338
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,239
Having no conclusion is my conclusion.

339
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,880
Virtuous or not virtuous

340
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,960
is easily disguised but hard to distinguish.

341
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:38,880
But as for legitimate or concubine, and elder or younger,

342
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,080
that's very obvious

343
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,080
and not subject to debate.

344
00:14:41,239 --> 00:14:42,679
If the concubine-born is truly virtuous,

345
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,440
he will not for the sake of

346
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,440
his own ambition ruin his clan.

347
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:46,840
But on the other hand,

348
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,880
if the legitimate elder clenches authority,

349
00:14:48,119 --> 00:14:49,640
and is able to keep the concubine-born restrained

350
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,679
so that he is not daring to usurp,

351
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,640
then he can preserve their perpetual prosperity as well.

352
00:14:53,719 --> 00:14:55,880
A man of character must be loyal to the ruler and love his nation.

353
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,000
It may be better to be a simple subject instead

354
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,320
to be spared from meaningless fights.

355
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,840
Look.

356
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,119
Just one sentence from her

357
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:10,599
and she shoved the two of us

358
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:11,919
into a bind.

359
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:13,359
Having us argue nonstop,

360
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:14,640
she watches idly.

361
00:15:15,359 --> 00:15:16,799
She has always been so clever.

362
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:22,640
Sixth Miss is so young,

363
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,440
yet you have such insights.

364
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,239
What a rarity.

365
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,039
Alright. Alright.

366
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:31,880
Very spectacular!

367
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,799
I'll be easy on you

368
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:35,679
and give no homework then.

369
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,880
What insight?

370
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,799
She's just glossing over things.

371
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,039
Be a simple subject instead?

372
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:49,239
Why go for meaningless fights?

373
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,039
Minglan truly said that?

374
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,960
Yes.

375
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,440
The child has rare insight.

376
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:01,559
When did she

377
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:02,640
start to understand that logic?

378
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:06,039
Sixth Sister has always been mindful.

379
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,559
She is just disinclined to talk.

380
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,400
It seems she was raised well

381
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,159
by your grandmother indeed.

382
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,119
Isn't that

383
00:16:20,119 --> 00:16:22,000
Buwei from Duke Qi Manor?

384
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,679
I suddenly remembered

385
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:28,960
I left behind a book.

386
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,520
You didn't. I counted,

387
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,400
and all the books are here.

388
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,479
I left it!

389
00:16:41,119 --> 00:16:41,760
Miss,

390
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,479
if you don't wish to see the Young Lord,

391
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:44,919
I can just chase him away.

392
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,080
You needn't stammer and run back.

393
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:49,799
Go and tell him especially?

394
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:50,880
That will just show us…

395
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,200
It will look as though I am fond of him.

396
00:16:54,719 --> 00:16:56,159
Let us just sit here

397
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:57,039
and leave him hanging.

398
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,080
He will know to retreat when it's difficult.

399
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,799
I will not retreat when it's difficult.

400
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,479
You. Weren't you at…

401
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,439
I am used to knowing your cleverness.

402
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:15,319
So I know for sure you would think

403
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,239
that I would be waiting by the path necessary

404
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:18,599
to return to Shouan Hall.

405
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,119
That's why I created the diversion.

406
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,760
Don't worry.

407
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,079
I've already looked through the surroundings.

408
00:17:31,239 --> 00:17:32,439
No outsiders are present.

409
00:17:32,439 --> 00:17:33,760
We can talk at ease.

410
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,520
There's nothing to say.

411
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,599
Xiaotao, let's go.

412
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,359
Sixth Sister. Sixth Sister!

413
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:42,479
Y, Young Lord,

414
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:43,680
are you trying to make things hard for me too?

415
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,479
No, it's not like that`.

416
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,959
I just wanted to ask you

417
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:52,560
why you didn't want the brushes.

418
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,400
Is it because they were not nice enough?

419
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:56,920
No.

420
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,800
Why don't you understand?

421
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,199
Any item that falls into my hands,

422
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,000
it will not last as long.

423
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:09,000
Instead of that,

424
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,280
it's better to have nothing,

425
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,599
and I'll feel at ease entirely!

426
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,199
You mean

427
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:15,479
they snatched them from you?

428
00:18:16,199 --> 00:18:17,439
Then that's great.

429
00:18:17,439 --> 00:18:18,680
Next time when I have something nice,

430
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,839
I'll come and give it to you in secret.

431
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:21,239
I won't let others know.

432
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:24,599
Young Lord.

433
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:26,040
I had thought you were sensible.

434
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,520
But why don't you understand still?

435
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:30,880
Let me speak

436
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,000
to clear this up today instead.

437
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,319
The better you treat me,

438
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,400
the bigger the trouble for me.

439
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,079
Trouble for you?

440
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,880
Young Lord,

441
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,239
you are a rare talent.

442
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,040
A man of great character.

443
00:18:57,199 --> 00:18:57,599
Knowing you

444
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,880
exist in the world

445
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:01,199
already makes me very content.

446
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:18,319
Don't regard me as trouble.

447
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:19,520
I will protect you.

448
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,319
Don't be scared.

449
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:24,880
In the future. In the future!

450
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,680
Miss, it's winter

451
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,079
and it gets dark so early.

452
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,280
How about we sew tomorrow,

453
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,239
so you don't ruin your eyes?

454
00:20:03,439 --> 00:20:04,079
The two elders

455
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,599
are about to enter the exam courtyard.

456
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,079
They are industrious, rising early and resting late.

457
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:09,560
I need to rush to finish these

458
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,040
two pairs of knee guards

459
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:12,439
and gift them,

460
00:20:12,439 --> 00:20:13,520
or else I won't be able to finish in time.

461
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,560
Two pairs of knee guards, Miss?

462
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:21,439
Then, I have a pair here

463
00:20:21,439 --> 00:20:23,079
and Xiaotao is making a pair.

464
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:24,199
So why do you sew a pair

465
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:25,439
in your hands too, Miss?

466
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:29,640
Young Lord is going to the exam too.

467
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,400
Can't be that,

468
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,359
this pair of knee guards are for him?

469
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:35,359
You. What great nonsense is that?

470
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:38,560
I haven't made this sort of thing for years

471
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,319
and wanted to make a pair of knee guards for practice.

472
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,160
So stop the nonsense.

473
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,640
The clothing for the exam court.

474
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:54,479
It can't be double-layered,

475
00:20:54,479 --> 00:20:55,599
it has to be single-layered!

476
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:57,199
Add a few more in here.

477
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:02,400
Be thorough with the four writing utensils

478
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,640
We can't have any lacking.

479
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,160
A thicker blanket there!

480
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:10,760
Spring has started,

481
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,040
but actually it's the spring chill that's fierce!

482
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,680
Spring has started, but actually, it's the spring chill that's fierce!

483
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:15,439
Last year at this month it still snowed.

484
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:16,800
The tribute yard is very cold!

485
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,040
You've never been in the tribute yard,

486
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,800
so how do you know it's cold or not?

487
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,439
Your father told me about it before.

488
00:21:25,479 --> 00:21:26,319
You enter that courtyard,

489
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:28,760
and once they close the gate and lock the doors,

490
00:21:29,479 --> 00:21:31,119
you're all alone to eat, drink, defecate

491
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:32,119
urinate and sleep. No one can enter!

492
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,839
Even if there's a fire, they won't open the door.

493
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:35,439
Your progress will be destroyed.

494
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:38,599
How can there be writing on this?

495
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:40,000
It's big trouble if they find it while searching!

496
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:44,520
Fine. That blanket seems thick enough.

497
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:47,280
It will do.

498
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,800
Bai'er, since he was little until now

499
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,680
he's not left me for this long.

500
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:56,000
He's sure to suffer.

501
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:59,239
Eldest Brother has long finished preparing.

502
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:01,239
He's more thorough than the entire family,

503
00:22:01,239 --> 00:22:01,839
so stop fussing.

504
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:03,479
He's more thorough than the entire family, so stop fussing.

505
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,359
How can I? Your brother toils in studying.

506
00:22:06,479 --> 00:22:07,079
Someone has to

507
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:08,479
be thorough for him.

508
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,199
Big Madam.

509
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,040
These are knee guards sent from Sixth Miss.

510
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,359
They said she made it personally for Second Young Master.

511
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,599
To shield himself from the chill upon wearing.

512
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:21,439
Knee guards?

513
00:22:21,719 --> 00:22:23,079
Sixth Miss said

514
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:25,040
though it was getting warmer,

515
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:25,959
at nighttime

516
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:27,160
it was still severely cold.

517
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:29,400
So she dug out some thick velvet from the storage

518
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,640
and made a pair of knee guards.

519
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,880
Hence, even if the night dew is strong,

520
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,079
his knees can be

521
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:35,119
protected from the chill.

522
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,839
Quite delicate work.

523
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:40,280
So does only my brother here

524
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,680
have this knee guard,

525
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,400
or does the one in Linqi Pavilion have it too?

526
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:46,160
They said everyone had a pair.

527
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,760
She's not offending anyone.

528
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,119
Pleasing both sides.

529
00:22:52,239 --> 00:22:53,800
Your own brother is going to the exam yard

530
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,839
and you did nothing

531
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:56,160
except talk so leisurely.

532
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,719
Look at her.

533
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,920
Her speech and conduct are both thorough.

534
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,280
No wonder Old Madam likes her.

535
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,560
These years, even the Minister

536
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,239
is starting to like Ming girl more and more,

537
00:23:05,479 --> 00:23:06,640
and you don't even try to learn from her.

538
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,680
Am I like her though?

539
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,560
I'm born into the legitimate line.

540
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:11,079
Shut up.

541
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:12,040
You're not allowed to say that stuff again.

542
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,800
Mistress Lin.

543
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,119
Sixth Miss made knee guards

544
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:27,079
especially

545
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:28,199
for Third Young Master.

546
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,280
What's this stuff?

547
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,239
Just throwing it here?

548
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,880
If I put that dumb stuff on,

549
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:38,160
I"ll be laughed to death by others.

550
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:39,319
It's not that cold in the exam yard!

551
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:46,479
This Little Sixth Daughter,

552
00:23:46,719 --> 00:23:47,599
she's at least stronger than that dumb one in Weirui Balcony.

553
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:48,119
she's at least stronger

554
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:48,920
than that dumb one in Weirui Balcony.

555
00:23:49,959 --> 00:23:51,000
It's just a pity

556
00:23:51,439 --> 00:23:52,119
she can't change her cheap,

557
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:53,359
frugal ways ingrained in her.

558
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,439
Sending such

559
00:23:54,439 --> 00:23:55,599
embarrassing items here!

560
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,040
My son.

561
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,119
You must do well for us.

562
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:03,000
Pass as a candidate and come back.

563
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,199
Then in the future,

564
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,160
no one can

565
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,719
block the three of us.

566
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:08,959
Mother, just rest assured.

567
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,319
Scholar Zhuang even said

568
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,079
that at my age,

569
00:24:13,199 --> 00:24:14,439
to be able to

570
00:24:14,439 --> 00:24:15,560
write such essays was not easy.

571
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,239
Many examples

572
00:24:17,239 --> 00:24:18,760
of much older men

573
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,920
still lack compared to

574
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,119
my knowledge and composition vigor.

575
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:23,079
Also, even if

576
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:24,319
I actually don't pass,

577
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:26,439
I have so many acquaintances all this time.

578
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,400
Heirs of grand aristocrats.

579
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,760
So I won't need to worry about not having a connection.

580
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,479
You're not allowed to speak nonsense.

581
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,760
You've got the big exam tomorrow.

582
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,920
Don't speak ominous words. Alright?

583
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:48,800
Miss.

584
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,400
Weirui Balcony and Linqi Pavilion are in total chaos.

585
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,160
More bustling than a family that's moving.

586
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,040
Big Madam and Mistress Lin

587
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,079
would love to just drag the storage

588
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:56,959
to the exam yard if they could.

589
00:24:57,719 --> 00:24:59,119
I keep getting called

590
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:00,359
to help with getting stuff.

591
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:01,479
I'm exhausted.

592
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,839
But don't ever call out your exhaustion in front of others,

593
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:08,239
or your exertion will get you no points.

594
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,880
Yes.

595
00:25:11,479 --> 00:25:12,199
By the way,

596
00:25:12,199 --> 00:25:14,400
Young Lord is going to the exam tomorrow too?

597
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,119
Miss?

598
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:21,439
Miss?

599
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,760
He...So what if he does.

600
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,719
It has nothing to do with me.

601
00:25:29,479 --> 00:25:30,560
Miss!

602
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,560
The Young Lord from Duke Qi Manor is here.

603
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:35,199
Saying since he's studied so much

604
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:37,800
at our home academy all these years,

605
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,319
he came especially to show his gratitude.

606
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,199
He brought gifts for

607
00:25:41,199 --> 00:25:42,359
each of the Young Masters and Misses,

608
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:43,599
delivered to each room.

609
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,199
Miss.

610
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:49,439
This was brought here by Buwei personally.

611
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,199
He said when the Young Lord sent him

612
00:25:51,199 --> 00:25:53,439
to purchase items for the Imperial exam,

613
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,640
he had him procure a nice brush for you.

614
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,400
And there are other

615
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,400
little things here,

616
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,800
to have you pick out all you want.

617
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,319
Buwei also said,

618
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:05,280
no one else had

619
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,959
this purple hare brush.

620
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,839
Where is the Young Lord right now?

621
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,439
He went to pay visit to Master

622
00:26:18,439 --> 00:26:19,839
and now he should be at Old Madam's room.

623
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,119
Miss, maybe we sneak out and take a look?

624
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,800
Look at what?

625
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,479
He's taking the exam tomorrow. Don't distract him.

626
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,479
There are too many items

627
00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:34,760
and I can't take them all.

628
00:26:35,239 --> 00:26:36,400
I'll just pick out

629
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,719
a few to honor his good will.

630
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,760
The rest,

631
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,000
let's have him take them back.

632
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,959
You two go out first

633
00:26:42,959 --> 00:26:44,319
and thank Buwei for me.

634
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,400
Alright.

635
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,079
Let's go, Xiaotao.

636
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,199
May you pass the exam quickly,

637
00:27:44,199 --> 00:27:44,719
to put to good use the exertion

638
00:27:44,719 --> 00:27:45,800
you've put in these years.

639
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,119
Afterwards.

640
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:52,000
Thanks.

641
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,959
Second Son! Second Son!

642
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,800
It's so late, but you're still going out?

643
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:08,719
You might get a cold.

644
00:28:08,719 --> 00:28:10,680
You're going to the exam yard tomorrow.

645
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,439
Tonight, just stay home and rest.

646
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,280
Whatever you need tomorrow,

647
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,119
brushes and ink, clothing,

648
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:19,280
carriage and servants,

649
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,439
I've prepared them all for you already.

650
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,800
Early tomorrow, the whole family

651
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,520
will send you off to the exam yard.

652
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,040
Won't that be nice?

653
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,920
If he wants to go, let him go.

654
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,520
I was going anyway.

655
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,760
You needn't chase me out, Father.

656
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:35,359
I'm chasing you out?

657
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,199
Your mother says to remain at home,

658
00:28:37,199 --> 00:28:38,199
but you insist on going to some brothel

659
00:28:38,199 --> 00:28:40,119
with your rogue friends.

660
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,800
Then you say it is I chasing you out?

661
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:46,119
Say a couple words less.

662
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,280
He's going to

663
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,599
the exam yard tomorrow.

664
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:50,800
Forget it. Don't plead for him.

665
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,920
He's already gone.

666
00:28:53,239 --> 00:28:54,920
How can we be the boss of him?

667
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:15,000
Darling Second.

668
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:24,479
Tomorrow at the exam,

669
00:29:24,479 --> 00:29:25,839
you'll surely place at the top.

670
00:29:33,199 --> 00:29:34,560
For you and the sake of the two children,

671
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,520
I must pass with high marks.

672
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,680
You are the

673
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,280
mountain for my children and I.

674
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,599
With you,

675
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:44,920
I fear nothing.

676
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:54,479
Here.

677
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:01,719
Tonight,

678
00:30:01,719 --> 00:30:04,040
just stay in my room and don't leave.

679
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,400
The two children are already asleep.

680
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,719
They are with the nanny. It's no trouble.

681
00:30:15,479 --> 00:30:17,359
Ye'er!

682
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:18,839
You've got the big exam tomorrow!

683
00:30:19,239 --> 00:30:20,560
Tonight, you should drink less alcohol.

684
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:22,479
Yes, Nanny.

685
00:30:22,479 --> 00:30:24,160
I'll go over to the study to sleep soon.

686
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,520
Tomorrow,

687
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,359
I'll escort you to the exam yard.

688
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,239
I'll chant and pray for you outside.

689
00:30:37,199 --> 00:30:38,680
Woman, you can still chant

690
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,640
and pray for him at home.

691
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,760
And you've got the two children

692
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,839
with no one watching them.

693
00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:45,280
Once Ye'er enters the exam yard,

694
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,439
he should have nothing weighing on his mind.

695
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,479
You shouldn't distract him.

696
00:30:50,479 --> 00:30:51,880
Nanny is right.

697
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:54,680
Those restless ones in my family,

698
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:55,959
they're looking for you everywhere,

699
00:30:55,959 --> 00:30:57,079
wanting to seize something against me.

700
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,160
You must not go tomorrow for sure.

701
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,280
Darling Second!

702
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,560
After you pass the exam with top marks,

703
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:14,199
you won't just abandon me, right?

704
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:23,119
For you and the two children,

705
00:31:23,439 --> 00:31:24,719
I've already gone to a deadlock with my family.

706
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:25,760
If I stop here

707
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,760
in the middle of it,

708
00:31:26,959 --> 00:31:28,400
then the sufferings will have been in vain.

709
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:31,160
My maternal grandfather was a merchant.

710
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,119
Since I was young,

711
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:35,359
I've known not to engage in a losing deal.

712
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,160
The four writing utensils are in this box.

713
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,680
The ink and tray

714
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,680
are wrapped in oiled paper.

715
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:03,560
Please be careful when you open the oiled paper,

716
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,680
so you don't soil your hands.

717
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,199
If ink taints the exam paper,

718
00:32:07,199 --> 00:32:08,119
that's a big trouble.

719
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:11,439
Sixth Miss of Sheng Family,

720
00:32:11,439 --> 00:32:12,280
after taking the hare brush,

721
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,040
did she send word with you?

722
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,520
She just tipped me a few coins

723
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,800
and took a few little items.

724
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:20,040
She said to thank the Young Lord

725
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,119
on her behalf

726
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:22,199
and nothing else.

727
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:24,719
Think it through again.

728
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:26,439
I didn't even see the Sixth Miss in person.

729
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,040
Even if she wanted to tell you something

730
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:28,880
she didn't have a way to send it with me.

731
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:39,400
That sewing shop is quite diligent.

732
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,640
I told them to make two pairs of knee guards

733
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,760
and he shoved an extra pair in for me.

734
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,400
They even used velvet for it.

735
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,959
That old sewing shop sure knows to flatter.

736
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,040
"Yuanbao".

737
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,199
Yuanruo.

738
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,319
Let me ask you something.

739
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,800
After you received the knee guards

740
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,439
where did you place them?

741
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:20,680
I put them in the basket.

742
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:22,319
Other than the knee guards

743
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:23,000
I also bought brushes

744
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,160
ink and trays.

745
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:25,719
I put them all in the basket.

746
00:33:25,719 --> 00:33:26,760
I sent them to Sheng House

747
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,760
for Sixth Miss to pick out items

748
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,920
and then brought them back.

749
00:33:32,239 --> 00:33:34,280
What are you smiling about, Young Lord?

750
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:42,760
She has me in her heart.

751
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,439
She does have me in her heart.

752
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:26,439
Miss, I hear,

753
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,760
Duke Qi rented the biggest inn

754
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,280
on this street.

755
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,439
What exam-taking is this?

756
00:34:30,439 --> 00:34:31,840
It's like celebrating.

757
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:33,600
Don't talk nonsense.

758
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,520
Matters of Duke Qi House

759
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,879
aren't something for us to discuss about.

760
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:37,520
Everyone on the street knows.

761
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,080
Not just me.

762
00:34:57,159 --> 00:34:59,239
They do look as though they're celebrating.

763
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,719
The Emperor dotes on Princess Pingning

764
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:03,520
the most lately.

765
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,399
His family is so grand

766
00:35:06,399 --> 00:35:07,439
beyond the speakable.

767
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,159
That's true.

768
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:18,199
So it just shows that one needs to have a mother

769
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,399
who is the proper wife to be the best.

770
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:45,760
It's nearly time.

771
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,879
Let them go in so they don't miss the exam time.

772
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,159
May you two brothers place in the top,

773
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:50,919
success with one stroke!

774
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,760
May you two leap over the Dragon Gate

775
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,120
and pluck from the Toad Palace.

776
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,560
Then I may you two…

777
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,879
drink lots of water and rest a lot

778
00:36:00,879 --> 00:36:02,760
during the period of exams.

779
00:36:03,959 --> 00:36:05,239
What's that you're saying?

780
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,600
You don't know how to say anything auspicious?

781
00:36:08,439 --> 00:36:09,840
I just said what came to my mind.

782
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:11,560
Then, I'll say . . .

783
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,639
Two brothers,

784
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:15,479
it must be stuffy and tiring at the exam yard,

785
00:36:15,959 --> 00:36:16,879
and water can kill the fire.

786
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:18,360
Once your mood is better

787
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,840
your essays will be written nice and pretty,

788
00:36:19,959 --> 00:36:20,840
as though helped by the divine.

789
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,959
Sixth Sister's words are true.

790
00:36:22,959 --> 00:36:25,879
We shall both drink a lot of water.

791
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:29,479
You never like to smile

792
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:30,600
but you actually smiled, Second Brother.

793
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:33,639
Then, let us borrow Sixth Sister's great words.

794
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,719
Done talking?

795
00:36:35,919 --> 00:36:36,600
Go on.

796
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,679
Isn't that the Second Young Master

797
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:12,719
of Marquis Gu Manor?

798
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,320
How come he doesn't even have a carriage?

799
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,120
He's the one with least fanfare.

800
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:22,439
If that Young Master wants to grab the attention,

801
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:24,919
I fear even the ducal manor can't cover it.

802
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,000
The courtyard is locked for three days during the exam period.

803
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,600
No one unrelated is allowed entrance.

804
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,560
Within a hundred steps outside the exam yard,

805
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,239
no one related is allowed to loiter!

806
00:37:56,919 --> 00:37:57,479
Over there.

807
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:15,959
This?

808
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,679
Confucius stated one should not

809
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:27,879
rely on devils or illicit gods.

810
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,479
You've got three gods you're praying to.

811
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,399
Which one are you pleading to?

812
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:33,879
Too much oil doesn't ruin a dish

813
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:35,280
and too much cordiality won't ruin a person.

814
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,439
Don't worry about which god.

815
00:38:37,439 --> 00:38:39,320
Just as long as I offer more incense,

816
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,399
they will watch over our Changbai naturally!

817
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,320
If Changbai is truly talented,

818
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,280
he will pass the exam for sure.

819
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,280
If he's just

820
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,360
an ignorant fool,

821
00:38:46,439 --> 00:38:48,159
even if you go to Buddhist realm,

822
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,320
and kneel before the Buddha himself,

823
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,560
that's still useless.

824
00:38:51,959 --> 00:38:54,600
Useless or not, at least I've offered my sincerity.

825
00:38:54,879 --> 00:38:56,399
Look at Duke Qi and the wife.

826
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,679
They even went to Daxiangguo Temple

827
00:38:57,679 --> 00:38:58,679
to burn incense

828
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,879
and donated thousands of taels for fragrant oil.

829
00:39:01,399 --> 00:39:02,239
I am just praying to gods at home

830
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:02,879
and nothing extravagant,

831
00:39:02,879 --> 00:39:04,479
and this still won't do?

832
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,120
Minister, you come and pray too.

833
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,199
Pray.

834
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:12,120
I'm not praying.

835
00:39:12,479 --> 00:39:13,479
I told you...

836
00:39:13,479 --> 00:39:15,000
Do we keep these things you don't want

837
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,360
for Second Brother?

838
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:17,399
Let me see.

839
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,120
You pray now.

840
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,360
Go on.

841
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:33,360
Dear various gods,

842
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,199
watch over my sons, Changfeng, Changbai,

843
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,000
so they pass with high marks on the first try.

844
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,760
Let our Sheng family honor our ancestors

845
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,560
and bring glory to the clan.

846
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:42,479
May the divine spirits watch over the Sheng clan.

847
00:39:50,439 --> 00:39:53,040
Minister, just pray already.

848
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:54,840
For your son, it's nothing bad.

849
00:39:54,919 --> 00:39:56,800
Go on. Pray what?

850
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,600
I have work to do.

851
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:38,760
Why don't you eat?

852
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:42,879
Second Son is taking the test.

853
00:40:42,879 --> 00:40:43,600
I made a wish.

854
00:40:44,479 --> 00:40:45,360
I'm abstaining from baths

855
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,719
and burning incense to pray for blessing.

856
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,879
I only eat two meals a day.

857
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,719
You've already spoiled him rotten.

858
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,000
Even if you treat him even better,

859
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,159
he still won't shine.

860
00:40:57,639 --> 00:40:59,360
He's only a child still.

861
00:41:00,479 --> 00:41:01,959
No matter how he wrongs,

862
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,040
I will still,

863
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,320
on Sister Bai's behalf,

864
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,879
dote on him more.

865
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,959
Minister, don't nitpick

866
00:41:07,959 --> 00:41:08,800
with that child either.

867
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:11,479
When others go to the exam yard,

868
00:41:11,479 --> 00:41:12,840
they call out and embrace.

869
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,639
But he went without

870
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:15,439
as much as a notice.

871
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,800
How does he regard

872
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,719
this father of his?

873
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:23,479
I imagine it's because Second Son

874
00:41:23,479 --> 00:41:24,520
is worried you'd might worry

875
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,439
he didn't want to call any attention to it.

876
00:41:27,439 --> 00:41:28,959
It's not like you don't know

877
00:41:28,959 --> 00:41:31,600
that child is always so thoughtful.

878
00:41:31,919 --> 00:41:32,919
Ji Kang and Ruan Ji,

879
00:41:32,919 --> 00:41:34,560
these great literary scholars.

880
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,159
Which one wasn't poetic and passionate?

881
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,760
Not like you. So just like him be.

882
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,120
Just a petty son and how can he

883
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,560
be compared to Masters Ji and Ruan?

884
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:47,919
Don't speak for him.

885
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,679
Since he passed the preliminary

886
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:50,760
to make it to the exam,

887
00:41:50,919 --> 00:41:52,479
I'll be easy on him for a few days.

888
00:41:52,959 --> 00:41:54,840
After the exam, I'll deal with him.

889
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,560
Try this. I made this especially for you.

890
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:07,719
Hurry and eat.

891
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:11,280
Little chicken eats rice gain.

892
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,560
Feed it slowly.

893
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,479
And a big bean.

894
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:24,760
Good.

895
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,399
Play well at home with Nanny.

896
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:28,439
Where are you going?

897
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,159
I just feel anxious.

898
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,919
So I wanted to go to the temple

899
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:36,439
and pray for Second Young Master.

900
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,639
What did he say before he went out?

901
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:41,560
He asked you to stay at home

902
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,479
to take good care of the children,

903
00:42:42,479 --> 00:42:43,560
and not to show your face.

904
00:42:43,959 --> 00:42:44,879
So you don't get discovered

905
00:42:44,879 --> 00:42:45,719
by people from Gu House.

906
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,399
Go back.

907
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,600
These few exam days, you just stay home.

908
00:43:08,479 --> 00:43:09,760
Put the rice in.
