00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Ming Lan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,580
Episode 50

3
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,600
Why are you standing there?

4
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,880
Does it hurt?

5
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,200
I'm saying nonsense.

6
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,880
You... Does it hurt?

7
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,280
I was too muddled.

8
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,320
I also do

9
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,520
know her personality,

10
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,040
but I didn't even have her body searched.

11
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,280
How is this your fault?

12
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,360
That woman Manniang

13
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,480
is good in everything,

14
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,000
except that she is bearing evil intentions.

15
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,000
She's like a crazy person when she does things.

16
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,600
If she wants to do any evil,

17
00:02:20,825 --> 00:02:22,560
you can't guard against her.

18
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,840
She said that Chang'er is dead.

19
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,720
I heard.

20
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,160
I don't believe it.

21
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,520
I don't.

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,800
That evil woman

23
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,636
has never said

24
00:02:44,636 --> 00:02:45,840
any truth to me!

25
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,880
I told you earlier

26
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,600
that he can't come in the day after tomorrow.

27
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,840
No matter how many days more.

28
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,480
he also can't come.

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,425
It's all because of a ruthless

30
00:03:06,425 --> 00:03:07,520
and dumb man like you.

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,360
You drove me away.

32
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,920
You kicked me out.

33
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,560
Those few money I have

34
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,480
can't support us last for long!

35
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,320
First, he got sick.

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,720
I invited so many doctors,

37
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,080
but it didn't work.

38
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,680
He died in my arms!

39
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,920
It was all because of you!

40
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You cruel father!

41
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,240
Servant! Bring the torture equipment!

42
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,080
Yes!

43
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,120
When you married this woman,

44
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,520
when you became the marquis,

45
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,840
when you were showing off your prestige

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,360
here

47
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,320
in Bianjing City,

48
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,240
your son

49
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,400
has already been buried.

50
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,280
Rainwater and snow have already soaked him.

51
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,440
Rats and bugs have gnawed on him.

52
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,120
Get me the torture equipment!

53
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,280
They're getting it Marquis!

54
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,600
It's you!

55
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
You are devoid of conscience!

56
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,560
Gu Tingye, you are devoid of conscience!

57
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,320
You kicked me out!

58
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,360
It's all because you drove me out of the house!

59
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,360
With her delicate appearance,

60
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,240
a few floggings

61
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,960
might kill her.

62
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,280
You then won't be able to learn about

63
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,840
the whereabouts of Chang'er.

64
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,280
Look at her.

65
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,720
She's like a crazy woman.

66
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,280
Wrong, she's indeed crazy.

67
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,000
If I don't use any torture,

68
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,560
what can I get from her?

69
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,600
I saw it.

70
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,840
But this woman

71
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,160
isn't afraid of any torture

72
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,040
or execution right now.

73
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,320
She now feels that

74
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,840
the whole world

75
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,880
has wronged and framed her.

76
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,120
Whatever she promises you now

77
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,520
might be broken by her tomorrow.

78
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,760
She's not trustworthy at all.

79
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,920
You still think that torturing her

80
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,960
can get anything?

81
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,120
If I don't torture her,

82
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,400
am I going to

83
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,800
even provide her?

84
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,480
Before,

85
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,080
you kept looking for her, but end up with nothing.

86
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:58,775
Even when you posted

87
00:05:58,775 --> 00:05:59,240
an official missing person notice,

88
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,560
you didn't find her,

89
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,280
How come she suddenly rushed to here

90
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,800
this morning

91
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,960
and that person from next door

92
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,960
was even coincidentally here.

93
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,040
She saw us

94
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,520
take her into our manor.

95
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,200
So what?

96
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,720
You think I'm afraid of them?

97
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,640
But Manniang is an ordinary citizen.

98
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,800
You bought her out of the slave status

99
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,120
and burned her slave contract.

100
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,840
Officially,

101
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,720
she's now an ordinary citizen.

102
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,160
This morning, a whole person entered our manor.

103
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,680
If she's hurt,

104
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,320
the adjacent house

105
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,080
will surely come to visit

106
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,920
and insist on enforcing justice.

107
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,040
What justice does she still want?

108
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,960
A third rank

109
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,560
government high official like me

110
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,880
was attempted to be assassinated by her.

111
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,920
In court,

112
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,080
I am the one to be seeking justice.

113
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,480
Even if she committed a crime,

114
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,200
she had to be tried by the court.

115
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,880
We can't take the law into our hands

116
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,200
and do the torture here in our house.

117
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,240
What's worse is His Majesty's throne

118
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,960
is still not completely stable.

119
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,840
Empress Dowager is peeking everywhere.

120
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,120
If you make any more flaws

121
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,480
and the other party grabs hold of it,

122
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,960
this matter won't be

123
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,120
just our private matter anymore.

124
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,080
Assassinating a high official of the government

125
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,550
is a crime that should be punished

126
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,280
by immediate execution.

127
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,160
Isn't she afraid at all?

128
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,680
Don't. You shouldn't.

129
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,480
Executions must be documented.

130
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,675
If it gets dug out by people

131
00:07:29,675 --> 00:07:31,040
with evil intentions in the future,

132
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,160
this...

133
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,880
what about the marriage of Rong'er?

134
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,520
You mustn't destroy

135
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,720
the future of Rong'er

136
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,159
just by a moment of rashness.

137
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,480
Looks like I can't do anything with

138
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,400
that evil woman anymore.

139
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,760
I can't just watch as Chang'er gets destroyed

140
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,640
in her hands!

141
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,560
Maybe, there's another way to ask her.

142
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,120
If torturing can't get her to talk,

143
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,880
what other way can I come up with?

144
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,800
Since we can't ask her,

145
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,320
let's change another person to ask.

146
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,520
Marquis, look, does this look like her?

147
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,520
It does.

148
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,160
It's as if

149
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,480
she's standing right in front of you.

150
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,200
I'll then draw 7 or 8 more

151
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,720
based on this drawing.

152
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,480
You don't have to draw it by yourself.

153
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,950
Call for the secretary or some more helper

154
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,240
to draw it for you.

155
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,080
Don't you know how many spies

156
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,480
there is in our manor.

157
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,650
The lesser people knowing

158
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,840
private matters like this, the better.

159
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,680
If you pity me,

160
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,800
just lose to me for two rounds in our touhu games.

161
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,200
I'll lose to you forever.

162
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,400
Boss, have you seen this person?

163
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,480
I saw her a few days ago.

164
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,150
She went to look for a man

165
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,080
from Yangzhou who's selling incenses.

166
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,280
Who are you?!

167
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:48,960
Let's go!

168
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,680
Who are you people?!

169
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,080
Help!

170
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,720
Help! Help!

171
00:10:55,092 --> 00:10:56,000
Help!

172
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,160
When Manniang left,

173
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,720
she got tracked by the Bai Family.

174
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,480
She couldn't resist

175
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,325
the good life being offered

176
00:11:03,325 --> 00:11:04,120
to her by the Bai Family.

177
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,400
Hence, she colluded with them.

178
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,520
They had her come to Bianjing,

179
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,440
stay by my side, and find a chance to kill me.

180
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,800
This way,

181
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,880
with you having no son,

182
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,000
Chang'er will become the only heir.

183
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,960
By that time,

184
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,160
they can control Chang'er

185
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,120
like a puppet.

186
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,840
They promised Manniang

187
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,300
that they would only take

188
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,280
1 to 2 tenths of my assets.

189
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,560
Manniang is greedy,

190
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,560
hence, she agreed to kill me.

191
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,120
You wrote a will before

192
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,000
to delegate your heir.

193
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,920
They don't know that it's blank.

194
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,600
What's the use of killing you?

195
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,650
That's why, they colluded

196
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:50,800
from both inside and outside my house,

197
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,100
and made a connection with

198
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,080
that one in the adjacent house.

199
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,925
The Bai Family wants to let

200
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:57,800
that stepmother intervene

201
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,920
once I die

202
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,400
and invite our clan elders

203
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,560
to void the legality of

204
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,440
that blank will of mine.

205
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,600
They

206
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,160
then can fully support Chang'er

207
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,800
as my only heir.

208
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,600
As a condition,

209
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,760
the Bai Family said

210
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,000
that Chang'er is still young,

211
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,920
hence, unable to serve the government.

212
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,480
Therefore,

213
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,200
it should be

214
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,600
my third younger brother, Tingwei,

215
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,080
who would inherit the marquis title.

216
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,760
Just for a marquis title and assets,

217
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,575
they've attempted to assassinate

218
00:12:31,575 --> 00:12:32,400
a high officials of the imperial court.

219
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,360
This is...

220
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,160
This is a major crime that is punishable by beheading.

221
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,840
How could they even dared?

222
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,280
But this matter

223
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,880
isn't a bad thing.

224
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,880
It's a good news.

225
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,600
How is it good?

226
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,000
At the very least, I know that

227
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,200
Chang'er

228
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,680
is part of their plan.

229
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,240
It then means that he's still alive.

230
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,480
Go!

231
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:27,100
Slowly. Slowly. Okay. Slow down.

232
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,760
Get on the boat!

233
00:13:34,087 --> 00:13:34,767
Hurry!

234
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:36,880
Move! Hurry!

235
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,680
What sound is that?

236
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,320
Hurry!

237
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,160
I'll go take a look.

238
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,960
What are you people doing?!

239
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,800
Move! Move!

240
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,040
My ship is full of salt.

241
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,760
Adding all up can get

242
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,960
you 3,000 to 5,000 taels of silver.

243
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,960
I'll give them all to you, okay?

244
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,750
Hurry! Move!

245
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,500
Hurry! Move!

246
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,040
You are not here to steal the salt?

247
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,680
Older Brother! Older Brother!

248
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,200
That little bastard Gu Tingye...

249
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,840
You are Gu Tingye's people?

250
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,320
He wants his son!

251
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,000
Oldest Brother! Oldest Brother!

252
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,240
You...

253
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,120
That shrew was the one keeping the child!

254
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,760
We never saw him!

255
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,000
Old Second!

256
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,475
Save! Save my older brother!

257
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,235
Save me! Help!

258
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,440
You... Save him! Save me!

259
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,160
Here. One more time.

260
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,840
Stabilize your hand.

261
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,960
Shoot.

262
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,600
One more time.

263
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,720
Marquis, news from Yangzhou.

264
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,080
Rong'er, here you are.

265
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,600
How did it go?

266
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,880
How are things going?

267
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,300
The Bai Family also don't have

268
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,160
any news about Chang'er.

269
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,800
I can't let Chang'er

270
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,000
be like me,

271
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,960
clearly having a father

272
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,400
but living like he has none.

273
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,200
I must find him.

274
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,400
Still no news of younger brother?

275
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,520
I surely will find him.

276
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,600
Father, I'll go beg mother.

277
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,000
She dotes on me the most.

278
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,440
She surely will tell me

279
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,600
where little brother is.

280
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,080
She's now sick.

281
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,120
You're still little.

282
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,800
You can't get infected by her.

283
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,080
Once she's better

284
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,069
and your little brother is back.

285
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,640
I'll take you to see her.

286
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,800
Father, I know that mother isn't sick.

287
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,360
It's late.

288
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,800
Go to sleep.

289
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,560
Be obedient and just sleep.

290
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,640
Maybe,

291
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,080
your mother will tell me

292
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,080
Chang'er's where abouts

293
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,040
by tomorrow.

294
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,360
When you wake up,

295
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,600
you'll be able to see your little brother already.

296
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,560
Okay?

297
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,360
Come, just go to sleep.

298
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,720
Be good and just sleep.

299
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,400
I....

300
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,280
will take you to see the lanterns next time.

301
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,000
Miss Rong, why did you come here?

302
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,720
This place is wretched. Quickly go back.

303
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,450
My father told me to come here

304
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,160
and ask some questions.

305
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,840
You're the one doing the interrogation?

306
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,160
Quickly open the door.

307
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Mother.

308
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,560
Mother.

309
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,600
Leave!

310
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,040
Why you are here?

311
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,200
Mother!

312
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,720
Mother!

313
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,360
Don't call me mother.

314
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,000
While I was suffering outside,

315
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,000
you had quite a luxurious life

316
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,520
in this house.

317
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,960
You now have a marquis father

318
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,080
and a legitimate mother.

319
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,040
With such enormous wealth and splendor,

320
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,280
why will you still want me?

321
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,960
Mother, I'll leave with you.

322
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,500
I'm fine even if it's to live in the mountains

323
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,080
or in rural villages.

324
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,640
I want to be with

325
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,440
you and little brother.

326
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,480
I'm not greedy for wealth and splendor

327
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,200
Mother!

328
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,920
Why leave?

329
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,280
Just be obedient

330
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,760
and stay here!

331
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,720
I want that bitch to see you.

332
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,520
Whenever she sees you.

333
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,200
she'll think of me!

334
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,325
She'll then remember

335
00:20:16,325 --> 00:20:17,360
that you are not her daughter,

336
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,600
but mine!

337
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,200
She then won't be able to keep that

338
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,480
virtuous noble lady act of hers.

339
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,120
Mother, where is little brother?

340
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,040
Let me see him.

341
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,400
He's dead.

342
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,720
When you were enjoying the wealth and splendor

343
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,920
in this huge mansion,

344
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,120
when you wear those gold and silver with you,

345
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,925
when you were taking in delicious

346
00:20:45,925 --> 00:20:46,880
and exotic food and drinks,

347
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,080
he died.

348
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,040
Mother, I'm afraid.

349
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,720
You want to see him, is that it?

350
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,760
Go to hell to see him!

351
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,160
I'll let you go to hell to see him!

352
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,040
Just meet him in hell!

353
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,760
You hear me?!

354
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,000
Go to hell...

355
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,920
and meet him there!

356
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,120
Go to hell!

357
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,200
Let go of me! You go...

358
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,360
Pull her away!

359
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,720
Rong'er!

360
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:27,960
Rong'er!

361
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,640
Rong'er!

362
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,560
You...

363
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,440
Don't!

364
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,880
Don't use force, Marquis!

365
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,440
Quickly take the child back

366
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,360
and let her rest.

367
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,520
Do it slowly. She's traumatized.

368
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,360
Tie her up!

369
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,100
Send her to the official court tomorrow

370
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:51,600
to be tried for her crimes!

371
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,720
You kept saying that

372
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,840
you're seeking revenge for Chang'er.

373
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,720
Do you really love him

374
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,640
or is just using him as a tool?!

375
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,525
I'm the person who dotes on him

376
00:22:12,525 --> 00:22:13,520
the most in this world.

377
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,960
What does a bitch like you know?!

378
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,800
Marquis clearly loves

379
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,640
the two children a lot.

380
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,950
Even if Chang'er's status

381
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:22,720
then wasn't legalized,

382
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:23,900
he's still is considered

383
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,720
an eldest illegitimate child.

384
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,240
If not because you secretly took him away,

385
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,240
he would have been like Rong'er right now,

386
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,600
being raised in a luxurious manner

387
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,840
inside the marquis manor.

388
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,080
In the future, his studies,

389
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,040
martial arts training, food and clothing,

390
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:36,160
ranking in the civil examination

391
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,720
would surely be among the top in this empire.

392
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,280
But you took him away

393
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,720
and treated him like a tool

394
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,400
to achieve your goal.

395
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,400
You even used him to threaten the marquis.

396
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,300
Marquis has been searching for him

397
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:47,960
for so many years.

398
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,200
You hid him so well,

399
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,720
that you didn't even

400
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,640
invite any teacher for him.

401
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,040
You even claimed that you love him?

402
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,440
You think all the people

403
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,520
in this world are blind?

404
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,775
I'm the person who dotes on him

405
00:23:00,775 --> 00:23:01,960
the most in this world.

406
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,080
What do you know?!

407
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,120
He also loves me the most!

408
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,240
That brute Gu Tingye!

409
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,920
In my son's eyes, he's nothing!

410
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,080
Tell me where Chang'er is.

411
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,840
I'm swearing by my dead mother's soul

412
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,400
that I will never treat him unfairly.

413
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,600
You little bitch...

414
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,120
When we were in the Yu Manor,

415
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,880
you scolded me to the extreme.

416
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,280
Now, you got married into the Gu Family,

417
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,240
and living a happy life.

418
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,000
You think when the Yu Family learns of this,

419
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,080
will they hate you?

420
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,320
When my Little Mother was still alive,

421
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,000
she told me

422
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,280
that if parents love their children,

423
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,400
they must plan for their future.

424
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,600
If you really love Chang'er,

425
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,760
think about his life 10 years from now,

426
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,040
20 years from now.

427
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,280
Do you really want him

428
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,600
to keep wandering with you?

429
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,560
Or,

430
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,325
it's better to let him settle down

431
00:24:39,325 --> 00:24:40,160
and be nurtured in the marquis manor?

432
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,960
Go to hell to look for him then!

433
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,675
The past affairs of life

434
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:12,560
is like a river flowing away.

435
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,325
In the end, everything will just be

436
00:25:16,325 --> 00:25:18,280
like a dream and disappear.

437
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,700
I can only get drunk to get back

438
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,360
to the flat roads of my homeland.

439
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:29,960
Other than that, where else can I go?

440
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,800
It's good for girls

441
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,880
to learn more.

442
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,600
But how come you had her learn that kind of poem?

443
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,360
That kind of poem

444
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,840
sounds ominous in the morning.

445
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,200
Doesn't it become depressing

446
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,280
when you hear it at night?

447
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,600
Xian'er.

448
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,320
recite something happier

449
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,120
Mother-in-law, if you didn't like it,

450
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,040
let's change to a poem by Scholar Su then.

451
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,200
Xian'er.

452
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,360
You all just have fun together for a while.

453
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,760
I'm a bit tired now

454
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,920
and will go back first to rest.

455
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,520
Mother, take care.

456
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,640
A major event happened in that house.

457
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,680
Earlier, don't know why Rong'er

458
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,480
suddenly went into the room

459
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,960
where that lowly woman was being detained.

460
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,640
She almost got choked to death by her.

461
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,160
What?

462
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,600
Madam, don't panic.

463
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,560
She didn't really die

464
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,760
and was saved.

465
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,880
I never saw a mother

466
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,160
who's like that.

467
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,160
How did Gu Tingye

468
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,200
handle that mistress?

469
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,960
Did he kill or beat her up?

470
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,520
He didn't do

471
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,760
Nothing at all?

472
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,960
It doesn't fit his temper.

473
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,440
That illegitimate daughter from the Sheng Family

474
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,650
saw that Second Young Master's face

475
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:18,400
has drastically changed

476
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,400
She immediately pulled Rong'er away

477
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,680
and had him leave.

478
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,200
That illegitimate daughter

479
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,400
from a small and low status family

480
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,560
have always been cautious all her life.

481
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,720
With her around,

482
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,400
I'm afraid

483
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,880
that Second will never commit any grave mistake.

484
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:47,400
Then that evil woman will be useless.

485
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,720
A member of the Yu Family

486
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,280
vomited blood out from anger because of her.

487
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,320
She was also a woman that Second once slept with.

488
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,300
Letting her stay for a day

489
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,960
and she'll surely cause trouble for a day.

490
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,600
Let's just watch

491
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,280
how Second will clean this mess.

492
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,360
Even if she's lying

493
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,560
and indeed hid the child away

494
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,560
and won't let anyone see him,

495
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,800
tell me...

496
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,600
Tell me,

497
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,080
where can she hide the child?

498
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,560
In her province?

499
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:53,718
Right.

500
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,840
A place where there are people.

501
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,800
It must be a place where there are people.

502
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,800
This child...

503
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,920
should eat and drink.

504
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,200
Hence, someone must take care of him.

505
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,680
He's not that

506
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,080
free and unrestrained.

507
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,800
Someone must take care of him.

508
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,080
Danju

509
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,280
Tell me,

510
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,560
if you have a child,

511
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,120
who will you entrust to take care of him?

512
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:25,920
Then,

513
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,575
of course, it must be someone

514
00:29:27,575 --> 00:29:28,320
that I trust the most.

515
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,840
Old Madam, or you.

516
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,040
Must find a person that one trusts the most.

517
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,550
Who then is the person

518
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,520
that Manniang trusts the most?

519
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,520
Parents, siblings?

520
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,920
That's right!

521
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,800
Brother.

522
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,240
A man raising a child

523
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,520
would be more eye-catching

524
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,600
than a woman raising a child.

525
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,200
Right. Shitou indeed told me

526
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,760
that she has an older brother.

527
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,880
Shitou tells

528
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,080
you everything?

529
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,000
He even bought me fried cherry

530
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,480
from the Nanbei Store.

531
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,960
Shitou.

532
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,840
Tie Manniang up.

533
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,280
Take her to the Kaifeng Precinct Office.

534
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,960
Say that she colluded with outsiders

535
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,350
to attempt to assassinate

536
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,000
a current high official of the government.

537
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,480
Yes.

538
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,040
Husband.

539
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,440
Husband.

540
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,480
Darling Second.

541
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,920
Husband,

542
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,320
I thought about it all night.

543
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,750
What's most important now

544
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,640
is Chang'er's whereabouts.

545
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,280
The Zhu Manniang now

546
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,360
is so tight-lipped.

547
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,280
We also can't torture here to threaten her,

548
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,850
so the people in the adjacent house

549
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:50,790
can't find any weakness to use

550
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,720
and bring you trouble.

551
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,480
You said to send her to the local court.

552
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,240
Let's not talk about first if the local officials

553
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,120
can get anything from her.

554
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,080
Just caning her twice

555
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,280
and she might already die.

556
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,900
No one will know about

557
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,420
the whereabouts of Chang'er then.

558
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,440
In my opinion,

559
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,760
why don't we just let her go?

560
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,520
Nonsense!

561
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,200
It's not easy for those Yangzhou people

562
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,480
to send her to me.

563
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
If I let her go,

564
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,800
when can I

565
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,680
catch her again?

566
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,275
Zhu Manniang is now like a tofu

567
00:31:20,275 --> 00:31:21,080
with dust falling on it.

568
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,240
You can't beat or hit her.

569
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,425
It's also easy for trouble to happen

570
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:25,000
if we keep her here.

571
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,680
Anytime soon,

572
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,500
those people in the adjacent house

573
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,000
might come to see her.

574
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,440
Just let her out.

575
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,400
When you let a mother wolf out,

576
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,440
she will eventually be worried about her pups.

577
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,280
She would then

578
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,760
try to check them.

579
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,560
You're right.

580
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,920
As long as we monitor her tightly,

581
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,520
follow the vines to the fruit,

582
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,120
we might find him.

583
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,920
If Manniang

584
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,920
left her child to someone else to be raised,

585
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,080
she surely won't just give it to any outsiders.

586
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
At most, she left it with her older brother.

587
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,960
That older brother of her

588
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,040
raising a child

589
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,000
would surely make all sort of excuses

590
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:09,960
and not put his effort.

591
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,120
Would Zhu Manniang be at ease?

592
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,360
She surely will

593
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,440
go check sometime.

594
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,440
However,

595
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,520
if she keeps staying here in Bianjing,

596
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,680
what to do then?

597
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,080
You are really a good daughter of your mother!

598
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,865
Hey, quickly put me down!

599
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,240
You've read the "Strategies of the Warring States"

600
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,840
or even military strategy books.

601
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,520
Quickly put me down.

602
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:43,960
Wife,

603
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,900
let us walk into this thicket

604
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,806
of thorny shrubs together

605
00:32:46,806 --> 00:32:50,120
hand in hand.

606
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,640
What are you doing?

607
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,840
Men,

608
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,440
remove her jewelries,

609
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,880
and search her body cleanly!

610
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,480
Don't leave her with even a cent!

611
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,400
What do you mean?

612
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,640
Are you going to kill me?

613
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,880
Help! Help!

614
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,920
Wait a minute!

615
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,520
Our Marquis gave orders

616
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,520
that you can go wherever you want,

617
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,280
except here in the capital.

618
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:21,880
If you stay here,

619
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,080
even if you become a beggar to seek alms,

620
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:23,720
no one would

621
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,680
spare you a cent.

622
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,560
Quickly leave!

623
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,400
What does this mean?

624
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,640
What does he mean by this?

625
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,680
He is unfaithful and fickle!

626
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,280
Leave.

627
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,200
He killed my child

628
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,320
and just escaping like that?

629
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,800
I'll let him pay with his life,

630
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,440
do you know that?!

631
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,400
He'll pay with his life!

632
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,600
Leave! Leave! Stop cursing!

633
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,450
Gu Tingye! You dallied with me

634
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:40,720
and just abandoned me!

635
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,225
Gu Tingye,

636
00:33:42,225 --> 00:33:44,720
you're unfaithful and fickle!

637
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,440
She drove her out of the house?

638
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,280
Yes.

639
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,840
Was she hurt in anyway?

640
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,000
No.

641
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,480
The people who expelled her didn't hit her at all.

642
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,520
My people by the side saw it very well.

643
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,680
She didn't suffer even a scratch.

644
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,000
She was also a woman not to be belittled with.

645
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,775
She was able to foil the two marriage talks

646
00:34:05,775 --> 00:34:06,440
with the Yu family,

647
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,880
but she's now out of methods?

648
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,850
That woman said that she's going

649
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:10,800
to report it to the officials.

650
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,160
But Madam Sheng said

651
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,200
that she can go file a case now.

652
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,000
By that time,

653
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,725
when young master removes his clothes

654
00:34:16,725 --> 00:34:17,320
and have them check his wound,

655
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,000
let's see who'll get beheaded.

656
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,280
I've spoiled him to the point

657
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,720
that he isn't afraid of anything.

658
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,280
This time, he actually was so careful.

659
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,720
I couldn't find any mistakes at all.

660
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,160
That woman strangled Miss Rong yesterday.

661
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,250
The guard said that

662
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,320
Second Young Master was so angry

663
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,680
that his whole body was trembling.

664
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,150
He also said that

665
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,200
he'll send her to the local officials.

666
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,480
But this morning,

667
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,600
after eating breakfast with his Sheng wife,

668
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,480
he suddenly changed his mind.

669
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,160
He only said to expel the woman

670
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,400
and that's the end of it.

671
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,080
Did you send people to follow her?

672
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,440
I've already had them follow her.

673
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,200
Those two people...

674
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,760
One is rash, the other very calm.

675
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,040
One attacks, one defends.

676
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,520
If we don't break them apart,

677
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,720
how are we going to kill them thoroughly?

678
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,000
Miss, do you want one?

679
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,720
You, you are...?

680
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,720
I entered the capital to look for my relative,

681
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,400
but my money got stolen.

682
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,360
Uncle,

683
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,520
can you be kind and give me one?

684
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,640
You don't have money?

685
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,400
Go! Go! Leave!

686
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,513
Uncle!

687
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,360
Please pity me

688
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,720
and just give me one piece.

689
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,200
Miss, I'm doing business here.

690
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,560
Leave! Leave!

691
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,760
Miss,

692
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,360
you didn't pay!

693
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,280
You can't eat!

694
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,320
Give it to me!

695
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:56,920
Miss!

696
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,320
Miss!

697
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,280
What are you...

698
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,480
Release her! Give that to me!

699
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,120
I begged for that!

700
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,600
I begged for that!

701
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,320
Leave!

702
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:07,920
I begged for that!

703
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,720
Leave the capital! Leave!

704
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,560
Come here!

705
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,240
I begged for that!

706
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:11,920
Get lost!

707
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,120
What are you doing? What are you doing?!

708
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,880
Lackey!

709
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,720
So what if he's the marquis?

710
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,600
Just because he's a marquis,

711
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,120
he thinks he's amazing?!

712
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,840
Lackeys! Bitches!

713
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,240
You two have been driving me away for a day!

714
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,000
They want to kill me! They want to kill me!

715
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,120
Leave the capital!

716
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,080
You can then go wherever you want!

717
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,720
Go!

718
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,520
As long as you leave the capital,

719
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,360
then no one will trouble you anymore!

720
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,000
Leave!

721
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,760
Leave! Leave!

722
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,680
Just hold her back a little.

723
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,440
Leave!

724
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,160
All of you, disperse!

725
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,880
Disperse! Leave! Leave!

726
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,880
Leave. Leave.

727
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,550
I just ask to borrow your fire wood room

728
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,120
for a place to stay for the night.

729
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,080
I'll wash your bowls

730
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,200
and wipe your tables.

731
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,440
I just ask to have a place to stay for the night.

732
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,000
Don't affect my business.

733
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,200
Mister!

734
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,280
Mister!

735
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,680
I can even sing.

736
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,000
I can even sing.

737
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,520
Okay then.

738
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,560
What song can you sing?

739
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,066
ChaZi.

740
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,080
Owner Zhou,

741
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,600
he's a woman who has committed a crime.

742
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,450
Our superior doesn't allow her

743
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:16,240
to stay here in the capital.

744
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,480
Please tell the other shops

745
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,280
about it.

746
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,520
Yes. Yes.

747
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,320
Leave!

748
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:21,960
Go away!

749
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,600
Leave!

750
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,120
Go away!

751
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:26,680
Let me tell you

752
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,720
that you can go anywhere

753
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,440
once you leave the capital.

754
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,240
But if you stay in the capital for a day,

755
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,275
I guarantee you that you won't have

756
00:38:34,275 --> 00:38:34,920
even a grain of rice

757
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,800
or sleep on any bed. Leave!

758
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,480
Leave!

759
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,400
I won't!

760
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,000
Leave! Leave!

761
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,680
You want to peacefully kick me out?!

762
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,760
Let me tell you, no way!

763
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,520
No way!

764
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,800
Quickly leave!

765
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:50,400
Who do you think you are?!

766
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,080
You...

767
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,280
Quickly leave!

768
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,450
A newly appointed official

769
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:56,240
of the current government,

770
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,825
Deputy Commander of the Troop in the palace

771
00:40:59,825 --> 00:41:00,600
Gu Tingye...

772
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,160
Gu Tingye...

773
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:03,920
Quickly leave!

774
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,760
is unfaithful and fickle.

775
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,400
He dallied with me and abandoned me!

776
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,040
Quickly leave!

777
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,880
He caused the death of his own son!

778
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,680
Quickly leave...

779
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,440
Go away!

780
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,080
Leave.

781
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:11,880
Gu Tingye!

782
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,640
I'm talking about Gu Tingye!

783
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,160
Get lost!

784
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,920
The currently highly favored official, Gu Tingye,

785
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,760
dallied with me and abandoned me!

786
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,240
He's unfaithful and fickle!

787
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,360
That woman is really something.

788
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,040
She can even come up with

789
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,560
a trick like that.

790
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,000
She's selling her miseries to

791
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,520
taint other people's reputation.

792
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,080
Throwing a sprat to catch a herring.

793
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,040
If that son of mine

794
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,880
send people to drive her away now,

795
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,300
it will look like he's guilty of something.

796
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,600
If he asks someone to refute her,

797
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,850
people would instead think

798
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:46,920
that there is indeed such a thing.

799
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,200
If he really confronts her in the local court,

800
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,160
who would care about a woman

801
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,000
in the streets like her?

802
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,600
Everyone just want to watch and laugh at

803
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,200
the embarrassing moment

804
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,080
of this new highly favored marquis.

805
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,680
Anyways, this trick

806
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,520
is highly beneficial to this woman

807
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,880
without any harm.

808
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,960
As for my son,

809
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:22,400
it's highly harmful but no beneficial at all.

810
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,040
She can really come up with

811
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,560
a trick like that.

812
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,350
Grand Madam, you live

813
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:34,600
in the inner courtyard of your mansion.

814
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,400
You surely never heard about

815
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,320
a despicable method like this.

816
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,240
Don't let the patrol guards

817
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,480
foil her plan.

818
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,400
Don't your man still

819
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,120
have some people outside?

820
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,960
Let them help her.

821
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,440
Yes.

822
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,480
The flowers in the garden this year

823
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,920
are really blooming so well.

824
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,520
That's right.
