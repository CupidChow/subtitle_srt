00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,533
Episode 73

3
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,920
Quickly, shot that side!

4
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,840
Quickly attack! Hurry!

5
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,480
The front gate can't be blocked any longer.

6
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,040
Hurry, Tu Second,

7
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,000
take Madam to withdraw from the back gate!

8
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,480
I'll take care of your rear! Hurry!

9
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,120
Madam,

10
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,760
quickly leave!

11
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,080
Why did you come so late?!

12
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,080
You...

13
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,760
Wife.

14
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,920
I've let you suffer.

15
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,720
Why did you come so late?

16
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,160
Making such a huge scene...

17
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,000
Is it fun?

18
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,160
You...

19
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,960
Fun your ass!

20
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,640
Yes, I came late.

21
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,400
I've caused you to suffer.

22
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,700
Gu Marquis is back!

23
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,680
Gu Marquis is back!

24
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,560
Gu Marquis isn't dead! Gu Marquis is back!
Gu Marquis is back!

25
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,000
Gu Marquis isn't dead! Gu Marquis is back!

26
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,880
You...

27
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,080
If you dare lie to me again,

28
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,560
I'll then...write you a divorce letter.

29
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,880
I dare not. I dare not.

30
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,200
I dare not lie to you

31
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:50,960
even by a word again.

32
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,440
You even say that I'm a fox.

33
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,520
You're the ancestor of the fox!

34
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,840
I am. I am indeed your ancestor.

35
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,240
Your ancestor!

36
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,600
Your fox ancestor can't stay here

37
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,720
no longer.

38
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,760
I must go to the palace to save the emperor.

39
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,560
I'll wait for

40
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,480
your return.

41
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,600
Jingli!

42
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,800
Guard the courtyard well!

43
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,160
Ensure my wife's safety!

44
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,560
Yes, Marquis, don't worry.

45
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,240
Take good care of her.

46
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,480
Back!

47
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,800
Storm!

48
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,600
Back!

49
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,100
Empress Dowager doesn't come?

50
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,782
Empress Dowager told me to

51
00:05:28,782 --> 00:05:29,920
relay this message as she said it.

52
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,120
She said that

53
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,200
you can decide on your own.

54
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,440
An old widow like her

55
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,520
will agree to any of it.

56
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,680
Okay. Okay.

57
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,800
It means that Empress Dowager

58
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,040
is letting you handle the empire.

59
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,945
This is a good thing.

60
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,960
We have a problem!

61
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,720
Sir!

62
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,880
Sir!

63
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,480
What is it?

64
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,280
Gu...Gu Tingye is charging towards here!

65
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:49,840
Who?!

66
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,800
Gu Tingye has resurrected!

67
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,720
Charge!

68
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,120
Hurry.

69
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,680
Shitou!

70
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,000
Marquis is back!

71
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,080
Marquis is back!

72
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,400
Marquis is back?!

73
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,200
Rong'er, come quickly!

74
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,960
Marquis is back!

75
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,400
It's a reunion! Quickly go! Hurry!

76
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,520
It's a reunion!

77
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,680
Get out. Be careful.

78
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,400
Nanny.

79
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,400
Your Majesty.

80
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,360
Royal Father.

81
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,000
Arrest him!

82
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,320
You...

83
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,880
You...

84
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,120
You all...

85
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,560
You are the trusted aide of the former emperor.

86
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,560
I initially hoped that you would treat me like

87
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,000
how you served the former emperor.

88
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,720
You disappointed me.

89
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,400
You're not the former emperor.

90
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,480
The former emperor is so pitiful.

91
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,240
How come he didn't have any children of his own

92
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,400
to inherit this empire?

93
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,800
What's going on?

94
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:38,880
Weren't you supposed to be dead

95
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,440
within those piles of sand?!

96
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,800
You wish.

97
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,320
Empress Dowager... She said that...

98
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,680
Empress Dowager said

99
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,000
that I was immoral and incapable.

100
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,720
I should be deposed and replaced.

101
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
The one replacing me is your son,

102
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,600
Zhao Yong.

103
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,360
Yong'er...

104
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,080
he is also your son.

105
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,200
Did Empress Dowager say

106
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,440
even a word of those to you?

107
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,200
She said so!

108
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,280
She said that

109
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,294
you broke faith and abandoned the rightness!

110
00:08:13,294 --> 00:08:14,600
That you disobeyed the former emperor!

111
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,440
Since it was Empress Dowager who instigated you,

112
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,600
let's go ask her then.

113
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,440
If she didn't say it,

114
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,520
my Noble Consort,

115
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,920
this is a crime worthy of clan execution.

116
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,240
Empress Dowager said it.

117
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,400
She said it!

118
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,400
She indeed said it!

119
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,400
She said it!

120
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,160
I dare not lie!

121
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:37,800
Your Highness!

122
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,400
Empress Dowager indeed said so!

123
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,360
Your Highness!

124
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,040
I won't meddle in

125
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,200
your family matters anymore.

126
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,400
My courtyard suffered a lot of damages.

127
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,120
Your Highness, save me!

128
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,120
I must go handle it now.

129
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,040
Go.

130
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,280
Get me my Drunk Immortal wine.

131
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,640
Quickly go.

132
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,080
Empress Dowager,

133
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,080
even if he holds a knife on your neck,

134
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,600
there's still a chance to survive.

135
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,560
Moreover,

136
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,080
it still hasn't reached that last moment.

137
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,240
To have the power to rule the world,

138
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,720
you must have army and money.

139
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,560
I don't have any.

140
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,320
I was stupid to think

141
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,000
that just by sending away the trusted aides

142
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,600
and fighting generals of the emperor,

143
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,946
and then winning over some old supporters

144
00:09:40,946 --> 00:09:43,000
of the former emperor to my side,

145
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,720
and putting the brother-in-law of Noble Consort Liu

146
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,920
as leader of the Jin Imperial Army,

147
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,760
I then can put my everything to fight them.

148
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,560
Now, I've fallen into their trap.

149
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,400
They have set up everything

150
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,600
beforehand.

151
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:03,040
How can I still have a chance to survive?

152
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,160
Empress Dowager.

153
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,520
Empress Dowager, as the Empress Dowager,

154
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,637
you naturally have the power

155
00:10:09,637 --> 00:10:10,800
to depose and install a new emperor.

156
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,480
Emperor,

157
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,360
he...dare not hurt you.

158
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,880
Did you not prepare

159
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,960
the Drunk Immortal for me?

160
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,240
Empress Dowager has never predicted things wrongly.

161
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,040
Why would you need to use the Drunk Immortal?

162
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,560
I know that you care for me.

163
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,800
But without such a good poison,

164
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,285
I fear that I won't be able

165
00:10:32,285 --> 00:10:34,000
to preserve a whole corpse.

166
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,080
Empress Dowager, you're wrong.

167
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,800
Do you hate His Majesty that much,

168
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,240
that you must have him killed?

169
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,400
Yes.

170
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,400
He was adopted by the former emperor

171
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,240
to be qualified to inherit the throne.

172
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,640
But after ascending to the throne,

173
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,160
he called his birth father as Royal Father.

174
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,320
Despicable and shameless.

175
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,960
Let me ask you, is there any son

176
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,440
in this world who has two fathers?

177
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,088
In what position have you

178
00:11:42,088 --> 00:11:43,400
put the former emperor by doing that?!

179
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,700
The former emperor has a very

180
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,120
benevolent and generous character.

181
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,340
He maintained the empire's peace

182
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,120
for more than 30 years.

183
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,480
Upon ascending to the throne,

184
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:59,040
you immediately disobeyed his will.

185
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,360
You recruited soldiers and horses,

186
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,800
intending to provoke our border.

187
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,102
I was married to the former emperor

188
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:09,160
for more than 50 years!

189
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:12,240
The former emperor has just died in less than a year!

190
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,280
I had to watch you

191
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,480
destroying the situation he established into broken bits.

192
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,880
Can't I hate him then?!

193
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,160
Hence,

194
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,800
Empress Dowager, you want to depose me?

195
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,200
Have I said those words?

196
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,720
I've never heard of it.

197
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,040
But I did tell

198
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,840
Noble Consort Liu

199
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,680
to be careful of what's under her feet.

200
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,680
Then it means,

201
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,040
the one who wants to depose the emperor

202
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,240
is Noble Consort Liu.

203
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:19,960
I indeed is preparing to fight a war.

204
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,724
It's just that right now,

205
00:13:22,724 --> 00:13:24,160
there are no battles in our border.

206
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,880
What?

207
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,760
What you saw

208
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,000
was just part of a scheme.

209
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,720
Eunuch Li has stayed by my side

210
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,440
and told you everything that's happening.

211
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,000
You refused to

212
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,120
withdraw from power.

213
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,280
You even controlled the jade seal.

214
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,920
I attended morning courts like a three year-old child,

215
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,800
unable to entertain my grand ambitions.

216
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:06,120
From the start...From the very start,

217
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,040
Gu Marquis pretended to be be overbearing.

218
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,440
You also pretended to doubt him.

219
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,280
Gu Marquis was in straitened circumstances,

220
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,000
yet he was able to survive it.

221
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,120
Why is that?

222
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:24,679
Because he might look very rough

223
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:25,480
and careless, but in reality,

224
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,160
he is the most meticulous person I know.

225
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,240
As for Prince Huan,

226
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,680
such an ambitious good child,

227
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,240
I am very satisfied with him.

228
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,480
You let Eunuch Li and Noble Consort Liu

229
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,920
exchange fake information

230
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,800
confusing my sight and hearing.

231
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,920
You made me falsely believe that

232
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,817
you were doubting your eldest son

233
00:14:48,817 --> 00:14:50,520
and valiant general.

234
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,000
So, you also don't have a headache?

235
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,960
That is to make you

236
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,640
and Noble Consort Liu think that

237
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,840
I won't live long,

238
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:00,950
that Prince Huan would soon

239
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:01,840
inherit the throne,

240
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,240
hence, you all must make a move quickly.

241
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,200
The government has so many problems right now.

242
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,640
I really don't have the time

243
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,760
to continue this act

244
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,560
for 7 to 8 more years.

245
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,320
The prey has already reached the side of the trap.

246
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,680
You just need to push it a little,

247
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,040
and it will fall into your net.

248
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,040
Hence,

249
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,463
there wasn't also any fighting

250
00:15:34,463 --> 00:15:36,000
happening in the border.

251
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,400
I dispatched my elite forces

252
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,760
and had Gu Marquis

253
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,443
and General Shen lead them

254
00:15:42,443 --> 00:15:43,720
to ambush and wait outside the city.

255
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,920
Just to fool your eyes and ears,

256
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,440
Duke Ying of the State

257
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,320
indeed went to the border.

258
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,040
After setting up camps in the border,

259
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,840
I waited after your spies

260
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,640
sending out their last message,

261
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,800
and then captured all of them.

262
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,960
I've always thought that

263
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,000
you're not qualified to be an emperor.

264
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,480
But today,

265
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,960
you actually planned it in such a meticulous manner.

266
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,200
You impressed me a lot.

267
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,760
I weaved a web.

268
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,600
But if you didn't bump into it,

269
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,400
this act would have been useless.

270
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,760
However,

271
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,640
in the end,

272
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,720
you still collided into it.

273
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,080
I...

274
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,120
I feel so sad about it.

275
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,240
Your Majesty had a resounding victory.

276
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,240
Why bother being pretentious.

277
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,240
Whether it's through poisoned wine,

278
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,200
or a white cloth for hanging,

279
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,680
just choose one.

280
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,480
Empress Dowager,

281
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,880
we became mother and son at such a late age.

282
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,520
We surely wouldn't have the relationship

283
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,280
of a real mother-and-child.

284
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,480
You couldn't be at ease with me,

285
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,360
I also worry about you.

286
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,480
We are like mutually fumbling

287
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,640
each other in the dark,

288
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,280
doubting each other.

289
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,320
We both committed mistakes.

290
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,520
So it means,

291
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,800
I should thank you

292
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,920
and write a confession decree then.

293
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:04,200
Your Majesty just hopes that Empress Dowager

294
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,560
can move outside the palace to live.

295
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,480
You...

296
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,360
are not executing me?

297
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,880
I wanted to unify my power,

298
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,600
not really to fight with you.

299
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:31,920
It's just that

300
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,640
the children have long made calculations

301
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,760
for this undertaking of our ancestors,

302
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,520
for the whole empire.

303
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,960
You... You entered my palace wearing an armor.

304
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,040
Did you come to kill me?

305
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,160
Grandmother,

306
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,920
the government now is flourishing

307
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,000
and we're receiving abundant revenues.

308
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,491
All of these the achievements

309
00:19:06,491 --> 00:19:07,425
result from the former emperor's 30 years

310
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,160
of doing every effort to make the country prosperous.

311
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,080
That's why, we're able to

312
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,320
use a mutual trading market to control our border.

313
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,880
But people can never have good days forever.

314
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,640
A flower can never be red forever.

315
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,880
If the government show any decline,

316
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,760
the people at our border

317
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,840
will immediately attack.

318
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,720
If at that time, the 16 regions of Yanyun

319
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,880
are still in their hands,

320
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,160
our empire

321
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,800
will then just be at their mercy.

322
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,440
Hence,

323
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,920
I want to use this great opportunity

324
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,040
to take back our lost cities,

325
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,920
recreate the defense of our border

326
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,960
and give our empire a place to raise horses,

327
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,720
a place where we can guard our cities.

328
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,640
After seeing him,

329
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,120
I finally feel

330
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,040
how old I really am.

331
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,720
It is indeed time to go out the city to retire.

332
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,920
Be careful.

333
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,120
Have you added water

334
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,760
in the urns above?

335
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,640
We did. We did.

336
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,520
How come the sound outside

337
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,240
is diminishing?

338
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,475
Maybe, Empress Dowager

339
00:20:32,475 --> 00:20:33,640
has stabilized the situation.

340
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,882
The sound then won't be

341
00:20:34,882 --> 00:20:36,960
as loud as earlier anymore.

342
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,240
That team who went to the adjacent courtyard

343
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,720
to capture the family

344
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,680
of officials

345
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,680
is also not making anymore noises.

346
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,240
Then, it must be after capturing

347
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,560
that concubine daughter,

348
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,375
they've already returned to the palace to report

349
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:53,880
the completion of their mission.

350
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,040
They didn't really capture our people.

351
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,280
Why

352
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,800
would they give us any feedback?

353
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,000
Yes.

354
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,920
Mother! Mother! Right.

355
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:08,800
Mother!

356
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,720
Third Young Master.

357
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,280
Second Brother isn't dead.

358
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,480
He's not dead!

359
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,640
What?

360
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,560
I went out to help put out the fire earlier.

361
00:21:19,575 --> 00:21:20,550
I heard people saying that they saw

362
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,440
him and State Uncle Shen

363
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,204
going into the palace to put out

364
00:21:22,204 --> 00:21:23,120
the fire and pacify the rebellion.

365
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,200
Big Madam.

366
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,160
There is no war in the border.

367
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,520
They didn't go far.

368
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,440
Right.

369
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,320
There really wasn't any revolt in the border!

370
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,280
Mo-mother.

371
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,200
Grand Madam.

372
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,920
Mother, you...

373
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,360
No, mother.

374
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:55,960
Big Madam.

375
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,840
You scoundrel!

376
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,320
You're not good in either literary or fighting skills.

377
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,160
I tried

378
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,680
planning your entire future,

379
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:08,880
yet you're a person

380
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,640
that can never be successful!

381
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,560
There House of Bai, a lowly family like that,

382
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,080
was able to produce a son

383
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,400
like Gu Tingye.

384
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,539
My House of Dongchang,

385
00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:28,680
which was an illustrious and aristocratic family,

386
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,440
instead gave birth to someone like you.

387
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,640
You're my son! My son!

388
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,640
I spent all my blood

389
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,160
and sweat for your sake!

390
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,080
Son!

391
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,040
Grand Madam! Grand Madam!

392
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,640
Mother, mother,

393
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,240
I also told you that Second Brother was a great man.

394
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,160
It wasn't me

395
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,440
who told you to go against him.

396
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,320
Moreover,

397
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,280
I didn't ask you

398
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,360
to plan anything for me.

399
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,760
Third Young Master, talk less.

400
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,520
Servant!

401
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,040
Tie up this rotten mud

402
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,040
that won't stick on the wall!

403
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,200
Grand Madam.

404
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,250
Mother, you're really going to cane me?

405
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,800
Servant!

406
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,640
Tie him up!

407
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:17,960
Grand Madam, you mustn't do so!

408
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,240
Grand Madam!

409
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:19,830
Mother!

410
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,920
I'll...

411
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,000
I'll throw him into this well!

412
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,600
Right!

413
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,880
You go reflect.

414
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,520
Go reflect on how stupid you are!

415
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,320
Grand Madam!

416
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,120
Mother!

417
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,680
Servant!

418
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,240
Tie him up!

419
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,560
You mustn't!

420
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,800
Mother,

421
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,640
are you crazy?

422
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,080
You...are going to push me down the well?

423
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,640
Are you trying to kill me, mother?

424
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,000
Throw him down!

425
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,880
You dare?

426
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,800
Although that's a dried well,

427
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,920
it's quite deep.

428
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,650
Third Young Master might get

429
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:47,440
gravely injured from the fall.

430
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,040
He's a person of the House of Gu.

431
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,080
Whether he gets badly injured

432
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,680
from the fall has nothing to do with me.

433
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,560
Mother!

434
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,400
Mother!

435
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,560
Nanny Xiang!

436
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,760
Big Madam!

437
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,960
His surname is Gu!

438
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:04,920
But...

439
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,640
he's your son,

440
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,920
Grand Madam!

441
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,160
This mustn't be done! You mustn't do this!

442
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,800
Third Young Master! Third Young Master!

443
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,942
Luscious branches of the same roots.

444
00:25:17,942 --> 00:25:20,440
Affection like that of real brothers.

445
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,575
Filial piety and fraternal duty. Be loyal and contribute

446
00:25:22,575 --> 00:25:24,760
achievements to the world and the palace.

447
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,000
Maintain the clan shade forever!

448
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:51,840
Here.

449
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,400
It's originally a dried well

450
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,520
that we were just too lazy to seal.

451
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,240
I'm unable to move this rock.

452
00:25:59,120 --> 00:25:59,960
Shitou!

453
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,120
Come.

454
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,680
Third Young Master!

455
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,120
Second Brother,

456
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,080
save me and get me out of here!

457
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,360
Third Young Master! Third Young Master!

458
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,280
Third Young Master!

459
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,000
Tingwei.

460
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,840
Second Brother,

461
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,600
I thought

462
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,020
I would never see you again.

463
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,920
Are you alright?

464
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:24,880
Does it hurt?

465
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,280
It's so painful!

466
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,600
So useless.

467
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,320
Second Young Master.

468
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,800
That ancestral hall...

469
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:33,880
Shitou,

470
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,520
weren't all the enemies already been cleared?

471
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,400
How come there's still fire over there?

472
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,960
Grand Madam...

473
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,960
She went towards the direction of the ancestral hall!

474
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:42,200
Mother...

475
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,400
Second Young Master.

476
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,720
Third Young Master.

477
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,440
Slow down. Slow down.

478
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,200
Third Young Master.

479
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:49,800
Mother!

480
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:54,760
Mother!

481
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,320
Mother! Mother! - You...

482
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,000
Mother!

483
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,560
Mother,come out here!

484
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,360
Stop him.

485
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:01,600
Tingwei!

486
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,680
Shitou! Get back! Get back!

487
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,960
I told you to reflect on your actions!

488
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,880
Why did you come out on your own?!

489
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,000
Gu Tingye!

490
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,680
Big Madam.

491
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,440
You're still alive.

492
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,800
You're the one who should

493
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,400
go to the southern opera to perform!

494
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,920
This marquis manor is a blood sucking nest of devils!

495
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,400
My older sister was a very kind person!

496
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,440
Mother!

497
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,366
Second Brother has allowed me to

498
00:27:28,366 --> 00:27:29,560
inherit the marquis title tomorrow!

499
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,000
Just for self preservation,

500
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,440
they married a lady from the House of Bai!

501
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,720
Even bore a child with her!

502
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,000
Just pushing her to the back of his mind!

503
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:40,200
You destroyed the House of Bai,

504
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,040
destroyed my older sister,

505
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:43,590
and now want to destroy me!

506
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,720
I'll inherit the marquis title tomorrow!

507
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,370
Come out!

508
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,160
I acted all my life

509
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,400
in this huge mansion.

510
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:55,320
I'm like a maggot in a sewer!

511
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,880
I didn't live like myself for just a day...

512
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,600
Mother-in-law!

513
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,040
Mother-in-law, don't be narrow-minded!

514
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,160
Come out here!

515
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,880
Come back here, Third Young Master!

516
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,720
Come back!

517
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,720
It would have been more satisfying

518
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,520
to have just lived in a brothel!

519
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,680
Miss!

520
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,600
At this moment,

521
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,680
I'm going to return to myself.

522
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,720
Miss!

523
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,175
Miss

524
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,225
Miss

525
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,160
Kill them! Father!

526
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,560
Kill them!

527
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,080
Father！

528
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,400
Father! Father!

529
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,920
Kill him! Kill him!

530
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,600
Kill them!

531
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,480
Father!

532
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,480
Kill them!

533
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,960
Beat him to death!

534
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,440
Busy in harvesting grains,and planting the seedlings.

535
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,700
After all, there are less years of good harvests,

536
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,000
and more years of bad ones.

537
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,560
The hardships of a farmer is unavoidable.

538
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,440
Your Majesty.

539
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,680
You're here.

540
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:50,760
Extend your hands.

541
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:58,840
Look.

542
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,480
Here.

543
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,880
Your Majesty, think about it.

544
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,020
You grant me such a little bit only

545
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,280
and drive me away.

546
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,440
Aren't you being too petty?

547
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,880
You macaque is being too mischievous.

548
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,200
This can feed everyone

549
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,240
a full meal.

550
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,600
It's the world's greatest treasure.

551
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,480
Yes.

552
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,760
Come. Come.

553
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,680
Let me taste it.

554
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:35,240
A treasure!

555
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,240
Little Yong'er, come.

556
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,840
Let us play with this.

557
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,680
Come here.

558
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,880
Look at what this is.

559
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,480
Come to grandmother.

560
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,120
Here, for you.

561
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,480
That...

562
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,960
Don't touch that. Quickly come over here.

563
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,560
Empress Dowager,

564
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,680
His Majesty sent you some newly harvested wheat.

565
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,640
It's already the season to harvest wheat?

566
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,040
Yes.

567
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,520
It's the season to harvest wheat.

568
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,280
Empress Dowager,

569
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,080
His Majesty asked me

570
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:24,360
if your health has been good lately.

571
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,080
He asked

572
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,680
if you're eating properly.

573
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,880
He heard that you want to eat some iced curdled milk,

574
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,720
so he especially had some sent here.

575
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,920
I've already ordered the kitchen to prepare them.

576
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,880
He's really considerate.

577
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:44,760
Sweet.

578
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,440
The wheat this year is larger than last year.

579
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,080
It's also sweeter than last year.

580
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,840
It's getting better every year.

581
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
We should just follow the mandate of the heaven.

582
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:26,600
Empress Dowager, I wish you great health!

583
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,360
Yong'er, come!

584
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,920
Come to my side! Come!

585
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,200
Come here to play!

586
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,800
Quickly throw it here.

587
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,040
Come.

588
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:48,920
You're very good.

589
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I'm not.

590
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,640
I'm not good at all.

591
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:57,760
Since I was little,

592
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,640
my family has hoped that

593
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,640
that I would achieve something.

594
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,000
My parents

595
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,240
doted me so much.

596
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,275
They exerted all efforts and

597
00:34:09,275 --> 00:34:10,440
exhausted all intellect for my sake.

598
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,320
Hence, even though I admire Second Brother a lot,

599
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,120
but...

600
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,640
I...can't really go all out

601
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,360
like him,

602
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,800
even to the point of putting my family on line.

603
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,880
If you don't want to talk, then let's not talk.

604
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,680
Thank you.

605
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,000
Thank you for trusting me.

606
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,600
Trusting that I don't have any ill-intention.

607
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,240
I believe

608
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,320
you are an honest man.

609
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,200
Just a few nonsensical words

610
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,360
and deceive others.

611
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,280
And acting like nothing's happened.

612
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,640
That's not something you've ever done.

613
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,720
What happened?

614
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,760
That day when I went to put out the fire,

615
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,520
under the blaze,

616
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,720
I saw Second Uncle and Sixth Sister.

617
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,480
So loving,

618
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,040
and I suddenly understood.

619
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,240
Understood what?

620
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,880
I understood why Second Uncle said,

621
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,080
that I would have a different world.

622
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,440
And you are that world.

623
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,920
Let us live our lives well from now on.

624
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,400
What I owed you before.

625
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,160
I will amend them all.

626
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,320
But you're wrong.

627
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,240
You never owed me.

628
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,280
No matter the ups

629
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,560
and downs of the capital.

630
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,520
Let us live well.

631
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,480
So you mean,

632
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,760
you knew about this

633
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,840
all along from the start?

634
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,760
How can they let me know it all?

635
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,600
They fooled me from the start.

636
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,160
Just that later,

637
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,000
when I fainted at the grievance drum,

638
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,560
the empress was worried that

639
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,302
I really suffered too much heartache

640
00:36:46,302 --> 00:36:47,280
after giving birth,

641
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,960
so she escorted me

642
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,960
into the palace to tell me the truth.

643
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,400
If you want your beloved husband

644
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,520
to be promoted and conferred nobility title.

645
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
You must let him accompany His Majesty,

646
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,600
to finish this play.

647
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,320
Play?

648
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,880
Doesn't Gu Marquis often,

649
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,840
be it at home or outside,

650
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,040
speak some wild words without restraints?

651
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,280
In the palace,

652
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,080
we've heard each of those words.

653
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,520
My husband

654
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,480
is an unabashed

655
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,240
coarse man.

656
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,120
The words he spoke

657
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,240
while going about on horse and shooting arrows

658
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,360
were all foolish and clumsy words.

659
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,960
May you never take them seriously.

660
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,200
Your husband nearly placed

661
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,960
first on the imperial exam.

662
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,720
In battlefields, he is most thorough.

663
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,000
How is he foolish and clumsy?

664
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,520
Each word he spoke,

665
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,960
was already, in advance, with His Majesty,

666
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,320
agreed upon in the palace.

667
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,760
Little Qin brought in

668
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,360
and instigated Madam Kang to kill me.

669
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,520
And she urged Old Madam Wang

670
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,680
to beg Empress Dowager,

671
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,760
wanting to cut off His Majesty's right and left arms.

672
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,880
His Majesty took the opportunity to go along

673
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,400
to lure the snake out of the hole.

674
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,000
So all those wild talks to you

675
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,600
spoke on Imperial Road,

676
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,480
such as exhausting the bird...

677
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,600
That was all acting?

678
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,920
If I was not sad and not in pain,

679
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,200
and not let the entire Bianjing population

680
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,600
know that I've gone mad from my sorrow,

681
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,920
then Little Qin and Empress Dowager

682
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,800
wouldn't believe my marquis

683
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,560
was really hopeless.

684
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,800
Gu Marquis, that rascal,

685
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,560
is really too outrageous.

686
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,400
Such a big matter

687
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,040
and he didn't even tell his pillow mate.

688
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,000
He made you suffer this huge turmoil right

689
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,800
after giving birth.

690
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:27,680
If you end up with some ailments

691
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,920
later on,

692
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,640
it's all to blame on that scoundrel.

693
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,120
He apologized to me

694
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,440
for a long time, too.

695
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,360
But the matters of the royal court

696
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,560
are matters of the world.

697
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,400
He kept it from me,

698
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,440
but I can understand it.

699
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,880
Fine then.

700
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,240
In the future,

701
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,840
we only have good days to come.

702
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,480
Don't worry, Father.

703
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,840
After passing this calamity,

704
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:04,640
our whole family

705
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,160
can be safe and sound,

706
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,160
and we'll wait for Big Madam to be escorted

707
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,480
back from the old home in Youyang.

708
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,480
And our family will be united again.

709
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:18,920
Do you want the little tiger?

710
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,560
I don't want it.

711
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,640
How about this?

712
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,600
The little tiger?

713
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,440
No.

714
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,160
Raise that board higher.

715
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,000
Yes, higher.

716
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,640
Fourth Miss!

717
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,360
Big Madam knew you came,

718
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,480
so she sent me to welcome you.

719
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,080
I didn't think your Big Madam

720
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,600
would invite me, too.

721
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,480
You are from her maiden home,

722
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,720
so of course you need to come.

723
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,680
Please come in.

724
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,360
Big Madam, Fourth Miss is here.

725
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,240
Almost time to eat.

726
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,200
Is it straight? It's straight.

727
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,200
Look inside, is it tight?

728
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,640
Left side. It's sticking up a bit.

729
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,720
Dad.

730
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,440
Slower.

731
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,600
Big Madam.

732
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,560
Be careful of your head. Come here.

733
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,160
Don't let it hit you.

734
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:27,800
How is it?

735
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,240
Big Madam, Fourth Miss is here.

736
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,025
Fourth Sister is here.

737
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,920
If you come late,

738
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,080
the fried squid would be gone.

739
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,160
Yes.

740
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,560
I can smell the fragrance of food.

741
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,880
Fourth Girl is here, too?

742
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,040
Greetings to Grandmother.

743
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,800
Did you also hear

744
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,960
that I cooked personally today?

745
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,040
So you came to try my cooking too?

746
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,240
The banquet's set up in the flower hall.

747
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,440
Everyone, please come to the flower hall to dine.

748
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,480
Alright.

749
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:04,960
Master Tuan.

750
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Grandmother, I'll escort you there.

751
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,920
Grandmother, please.

752
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,120
this little Tuan.

753
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,400
Little Tuan.

754
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,840
Slower.

755
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,040
Wife!

756
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,080
Slower

757
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,080
You slower.

758
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,800
Let me tell you.

759
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,640
Release Xiaotao

760
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,040
so she can rest up.

761
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,280
Or this Shitou, everyday,

762
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,920
he's so careful

763
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,400
like he's lost his soul.

764
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,320
This way.

765
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,760
Slower, my Little Shitou.

766
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,560
Look! Look at him.

767
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,840
He doesn't even know which door to go.

768
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,760
Don't let me rest anymore, Marquis.

769
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,520
I've gone mad

770
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,640
from boredom at home.

771
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,280
I just want to spend the days

772
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,400
with Big Madam joking and talking.

773
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,120
Go eating.

774
00:42:59,120 --> 00:42:59,920
Okay.

775
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,000
Not everyone cares

776
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,040
about your care.

777
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,080
As long as you

778
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,080
care about my care.

779
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,160
The young duke. He's not even back yet.

780
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,600
But the report on Xinan tea tax

781
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,600
is already here.

782
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,000
Prime Minister Han is looking around everywhere

783
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,440
lately to ask about the details.

784
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,000
What do you think, father?

785
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,600
Just rest for a day and nothing

786
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,560
will happen to the royal court.

787
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,320
It's true.

788
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,480
You haven't had enough of

789
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,400
inquisition from Prime Minister Han?

790
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,200
Not just that.

791
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,320
Prime Minister Han

792
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,240
asked me to come lately

793
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,120
and he asked me personally about raising horses.

794
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,280
Your brother didn't go to the ranch anymore?

795
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,880
Our sixth brother-in-law.

796
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,840
He took out all His Majesty's badges

797
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,200
forbidding miscellaneous personnel

798
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,000
from entrance to palace.

799
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,120
His brother can still dare to go?

800
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,240
Such ruckus in the shrine.

801
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,400
Quite disrespectful.

802
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,560
It's true.

803
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,640
This is life.

804
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,360
I just love

805
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,960
this kind of easy quiet life.

806
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,160
It's best if

807
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,360
nothing happens at all.

808
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,720
Don't worry, wife.

809
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,480
I will stand guard outside holding a sword.

810
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,600
Even if the sky collapses,

811
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,880
I will have you

812
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:19,880
eat a meal safe and quietly.

813
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,120
Fine. Let's eat.

814
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:25,720
Wife.

815
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,920
Careful of the steps.
