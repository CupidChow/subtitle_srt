00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,525
The Story of Minglan

2
00:00:59,525 --> 00:01:02,125
Episode 41

3
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,800
Blessings to brother-in-law.

4
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,825
Where are you going?

5
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,280
My wife's asleep.

6
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,160
But haven't you already

7
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,480
paid respect to the parents?

8
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,224
She went to sleep late last night

9
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,560
and got up early this morning.

10
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,640
Let her nap longer.

11
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,880
But Mother Cui said Qin...

12
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,360
Is Mother Cui in charge,

13
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,560
or am I in charge here?

14
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,240
Rules are set by people

15
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,600
and as long as I'm here,

16
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:57,920
your Miss

17
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,360
can sleep until midday

18
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,760
and no one will say a thing.

19
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,080
Yes.

20
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,240
Miss, why are you still sleeping?

21
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,360
Hurry and get up!

22
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,560
Who opened the door? so cold.

23
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,180
Oh my, Miss, how can you go back in bed again?

24
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,520
If other people know,

25
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,040
you'll be laughed at.

26
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,160
Hurry and get up.

27
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,240
Your husband's already

28
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,640
practiced the spear many times in the courtyard.

29
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,360
You should have enough sleep.

30
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,920
Also,

31
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,120
Big Madam Qin has sent someone to call you,

32
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,160
saying she's having you come

33
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,560
and have a private woman's talk.

34
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,160
Come on, good girl.

35
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,000
Good girl. Get up.

36
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,680
Gu Tingye said

37
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,840
I can sleep as long as I want.

38
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,475
Gu House is an aristocratic family

39
00:02:46,475 --> 00:02:47,200
with a marquis manor.

40
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,680
It can't be haphazard,

41
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,160
or we will give other people subjects for ridicule

42
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,560
our Sheng Family

43
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,560
as having unruly daughters.

44
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,480
Hurry and get up.

45
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,680
Danju, Xiaotao!

46
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,025
Help Miss do the hair and makeup.

47
00:02:59,025 --> 00:02:59,400
Dress her!

48
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,320
He clearly said

49
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,680
I could sleep more.

50
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,320
What are you doing?

51
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,920
You two are still watching?

52
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,800
Hurry and go out!

53
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,440
Look how sleepy you look.

54
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,560
Why are you putting makeup on again?

55
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,080
I want to hug you

56
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,440
and sleep more.

57
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,000
The elder asks me to come

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,520
and share some private talks.

59
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,800
So I'm . . .

60
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,040
I should wash and dress again.

61
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,800
Your husband will help you do the makeup.

62
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,560
You know how?

63
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,700
You thought all these years

64
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,120
I rolled around in vain in those brothels

65
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,920
and entertainment inns?

66
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,900
Let me tell you.

67
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,920
When it comes to powder and rouge

68
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,200
and earrings and accessories,

69
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,120
I think I might be clearer than you are.

70
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,280
Let me tell you.

71
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,360
If you don't want to go, then don't go.

72
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,320
We've already paid respect to the parents anyway.

73
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,440
The rest don't matter.

74
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,760
But I should at least go make my appearance

75
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,360
or else the word gets out,

76
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,240
and they will say our Sheng family

77
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,320
can't teach their daughters well.

78
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,125
And they'll say you don't respect

79
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,040
your legitimate mother

80
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,920
and you're an unfilial rogue.

81
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,400
I don't even care about that.

82
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,360
Why do you care?

83
00:05:00,745 --> 00:05:01,720
I.

84
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,120
What newly-wed bride

85
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,680
isn't riled up by her mother-in-law?

86
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,480
I just ignore them.

87
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,120
That stepmother of mine, Little Qin.

88
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,320
She won't be the first to speak.

89
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,240
The first to talk

90
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,480
will definitely be the Fourth

91
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,360
or Fifth House.

92
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,520
Especially the Fourth House.

93
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,475
She loves to bully the weak

94
00:05:25,475 --> 00:05:26,400
and cower from the strong,

95
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,560
and she's got a a temper of firecracker.

96
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,040
When my stepmother gives her the cue,

97
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,320
she'll fire up.

98
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,320
You should be careful.

99
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,840
Don't get bitten by her.

100
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,800
She's your aunt-in-law anyway.

101
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,475
Those few are considered easily enough

102
00:05:44,475 --> 00:05:45,120
to deal with.

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,520
In our Gu House,

104
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,240
everyone's skilled in framing people.

105
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,120
"Some Gu went to a brothel

106
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,760
and that must be Gu Tingye."

107
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,440
"Some Gu

108
00:05:58,444 --> 00:06:00,720
shattered Old Master's ink stone,

109
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,160
and it must be Gu Tingye."

110
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,100
"Some Gu wanted three thousand taels

111
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,240
of expenditure and sure,

112
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,640
put that on Gu Tingye's account."

113
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,600
But it's my own delinquency to be blamed too.

114
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,840
I didn't have a good reputation

115
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,680
so I could only

116
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,760
endure their framing.

117
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,760
Just sit and watch them

118
00:06:21,275 --> 00:06:22,915
ruin my reputation

119
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,360
in the capital completely.

120
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,560
This is not only a crazy dog

121
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,360
we're talking about.

122
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,640
They're more poisonous than a poisonous snake.

123
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,080
When it bites you,

124
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,880
you can't even scream!

125
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,840
That's not what you said

126
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,200
before you married me though.

127
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,800
You had me puffed up with pride!

128
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,760
Fine. In a few days,

129
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,920
we'll find some pretext

130
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,960
and move out!

131
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,040
We'll move out and things will halt.

132
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,320
Miss, these are snacks offered to you

133
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,800
from the kitchen.

134
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,160
Oh gosh!

135
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,280
What happened to your face?

136
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,520
You! You said

137
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,120
you're capable with makeup and accessories!

138
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,320
Xiaotao, Danju, hurry and come.

139
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,040
wash and redo the makeup for the Miss!

140
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,320
Hurry and wipe it off!

141
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,240
Still laughing?

142
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,040
Respectful greetings to Mother-in-law.

143
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,920
I wonder what instructions Mother-in-law

144
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,360
has for me to summon me?

145
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,840
What do you mean instructions?

146
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,000
I just want to have breakfast,

147
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,600
and invite you

148
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,040
to enjoy breakfast together

149
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,600
with me and the aunts.

150
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,040
A whole family, nice and cozy.

151
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,720
Then allow your daughter-in-law to serve you,

152
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,300
Mother-in-law, and Fourth and Fifth Aunts-in-law,

153
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:10,960
as you have your meal.

154
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,920
There's no need to serve!

155
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,720
We are a military general's family.

156
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,360
We don't have so many rules.

157
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,600
Come on. Send in the breakfast.

158
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,440
Eldest Sister-in-law.

159
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,280
Look at that memory of yours!

160
00:08:23,993 --> 00:08:25,233
There's still one people

161
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,360
we should let the new bride

162
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,080
to meet

163
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,120
before breakfast.

164
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,720
It's alright to meet another day.

165
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,480
No, we can't!

166
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,960
She already committed suicide once.

167
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,560
Thanks to the maidservants

168
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,680
who saw her and saved her.

169
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,960
If we keep

170
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,280
hiding and push it off,

171
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,160
and if she really dies in the future,

172
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,440
wouldn't we

173
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,600
add curses to them?

174
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,920
That's not suitable I think.

175
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
They are newly-weds after all.

176
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,960
How is it not suitable?

177
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,280
Who is this person?

178
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,840
Based on the words of Fourth Aunt,

179
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,960
this person seems to have something to do with me.

180
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,760
Hongxiao, come in.

181
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,240
Come in!

182
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,280
This miss is?

183
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,560
This girl is called Hongxiao.

184
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,320
She used to be Second Son's maid.

185
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,600
Later, when Second Son got older,

186
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,760
we just kept her in the chamber.

187
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,080
Then even later on,

188
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,280
Second Son wasn't coming back often.

189
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,640
I was afraid that

190
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,360
we'd delay her youth for nothing.

191
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,280
So I returned her slave

192
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,520
contract to her

193
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,640
and gave her money and assets

194
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,080
so she could marry someone else.

195
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,600
But,

196
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,760
she is just so

197
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,660
devoted and loyal.

198
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,400
Saying she won't leave,

199
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,240
and has to wait here.

200
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,640
But now

201
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,680
Brother Ye is back in glory

202
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,280
and married and promoted,

203
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,760
yet she's been

204
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,760
forgotten by him altogether.

205
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,520
Tell me, this girl is all alone,

206
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,480
how can she survive?

207
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,200
I

208
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,760
really don't know

209
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,040
what to do either.

210
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,080
She's resolute

211
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,960
and saying she won't remarry no matter what happens.

212
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,840
This can be considered an act of loyalty

213
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,600
and chaste conduct towards a man.

214
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,920
If she really doesn't get any status,

215
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,760
later on,

216
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,480
how will she raise her head up and live?

217
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,640
Mother-in-law means,

218
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,240
I should take this Miss Hongxiao back

219
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,200
and have her be

220
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,640
my husband's concubine?

221
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,040
I was thinking,

222
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,500
Second Son is an important officer

223
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,080
in the royal court now.

224
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,200
That's true. Just look around,

225
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,800
Which high official only has

226
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,600
one wife?

227
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,920
If there aren't

228
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,320
a few concubines around,

229
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,880
he has no prestige.

230
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,320
New bride, what do you think?

231
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,920
If she doesn't have a status,

232
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,600
it's not so bad.

233
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,120
Hongxiao

234
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,680
is a docile girl anyway.

235
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,200
She just wants to stay loyal.

236
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,240
As long as she has a place to go,

237
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,240
then she won't be gossiped about

238
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,950
and pointed at by the people

239
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:56,560
in the manor.

240
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,760
Right, right!

241
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,720
Please be merciful, Madam.

242
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,200
Let Hongxiao survive!

243
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,720
Forgive me, for I cannot obey.

244
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,520
This.

245
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,200
They all say Sheng Family

246
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,520
is an honest scholarly one,

247
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,880
so how did they teach their daughter

248
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,480
to be so jealous and cruel?

249
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,080
Last night my husband told me

250
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:36,925
he's not intended to

251
00:12:36,925 --> 00:12:37,840
get a concubine anytime soon.

252
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:38,920
If I turn around

253
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,400
and bring a concubine for him,

254
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,800
wouldn't I piss him off?

255
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,840
If I make my husband to be upset,

256
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,120
it means I'm incompetent

257
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,480
and it means I'm unfilial.

258
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,200
So on this matter,

259
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,440
I really don't dare.

260
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,360
You all heard her!

261
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,600
The new bride's only come for the first day,

262
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,120
and she dares to speak like this

263
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,200
before the elders!

264
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,480
Ridiculous.

265
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,325
Fourth Sister,

266
00:13:06,325 --> 00:13:07,520
don't be angry.

267
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,640
How about this then?

268
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,600
You just take in the girl first

269
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,480
and we can discuss about it later.

270
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,600
I really don't dare to

271
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,720
make this decision for my husband.

272
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,800
How are you not bold?

273
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,200
You're clearly stonewalling us with words!

274
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,200
Who knows if Brother Ye

275
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,520
actually said such a thing!

276
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,800
Maybe

277
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,680
you are just making it all up.

278
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,475
Whether he said that or not,

279
00:13:35,475 --> 00:13:36,450
once he's back,

280
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,720
you can just ask him.

281
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,000
You're just a child...

282
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,200
What do you mean by child?

283
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,360
She's already someone's wife.

284
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,840
How is she a child?

285
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,760
I just don't get it.

286
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,840
Didn't her parents teach her

287
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,080
before she married?

288
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,550
Once you come to the mother-in-law's home,

289
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,800
you should know your place and have propriety.

290
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,520
Let's not talk about other stuff

291
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,760
but on the first day after marriage,

292
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,520
it's already the midday,

293
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,375
and she finally comes to pay respects

294
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:57,880
to us and afterwards,

295
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,720
she doesn't even serve us!

296
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,240
If we didn't call her to come to listen to our words,

297
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,800
I think in the future,

298
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,880
it'll be hard to even see her!

299
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,160
A person like her,

300
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,680
how can she from a scholarly family

301
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,080
of honest officials?

302
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,040
Eldest Sister-in-law.

303
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,125
You can't blame Fourth Sister-in-law

304
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:17,720
for being angry.

305
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,120
Ye's bride

306
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,840
is a bit outrageous indeed.

307
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,520
Hongxiao,

308
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,840
have caused disharmony in the house!

309
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,400
Let me go to death instead!

310
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,120
Let me die,

311
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,160
Let me die!

312
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,825
Mother-in-law,

313
00:14:41,825 --> 00:14:43,640
your daughter-in-law is young and ignorant

314
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,680
and I have offended the elders.

315
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,175
But,

316
00:14:47,175 --> 00:14:48,440
I cannot defy my husband.

317
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,600
I am willing to ask a punishment

318
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,275
of kneeling before the ancestors to

319
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,480
report my offense and seek forgiveness.

320
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,920
Miss.

321
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,800
Miss, why are you doing this?

322
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,200
They are just

323
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,480
more delighted.

324
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,480
A new bride comes into the mother-in-law's house,

325
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,240
and they want to embarrass her.

326
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,920
Even if I pull myself

327
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,440
out of it today,

328
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,760
there's more tomorrow.

329
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,040
And if I don't kneel tomorrow,

330
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,850
there's still the day after

331
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:44,680
and the day after that.

332
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,360
Instead of having them keep scheming,

333
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,640
It's better for me

334
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,120
to stop them myself once for all,

335
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,320
and save some saliva.

336
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,160
That's true,

337
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,880
but if we kneel too long,

338
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,360
we are just

339
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,200
doing harm to our own bodies.

340
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,200
the brother-in-law told me

341
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,040
this stepmother of his is a fake Bodhisattva,

342
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,960
a tiger with a smiling face.

343
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,280
She intends to kill with a borrowed knife,

344
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,840
and she intends to salvage her gentle

345
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,200
and virtuous reputation too.

346
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,480
If he was right,

347
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,840
at this time, this stepmother of his

348
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,920
should be sitting anxiously,

349
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,280
and figuring out how she can stop me

350
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,760
from kneeling too long.

351
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,480
I understand now, Miss.

352
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,800
The first day the bride is in,

353
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,550
and she gets punished

354
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,560
by the mother-in-law and elders

355
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,160
to kneel before the shrine.

356
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,960
If the word gets out,

357
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,680
the Big Madam will be called harsh.

358
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:42,960
That's right.

359
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,800
We've dealt with our

360
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,560
Big Madam Wang and Mistress Lin all these years,

361
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,640
and there's got to be something we've learned.

362
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,760
Eldest Sister-in-law,

363
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,280
you're too kind

364
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,280
and you'll just let her bully you?

365
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,360
It was that rascal Gu Tingye before.

366
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,760
Now he's got a wife!

367
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,280
And now she dares to not listen to you?

368
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,160
Is she rebelling?

369
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,160
She's a child.

370
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,800
If she makes an error,

371
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,520
we will tell her slowly.

372
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,120
At the first day of marriage

373
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,880
and we have the bride kneeling for punishment.

374
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,680
If the word gets out,

375
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,320
people will laugh at us.

376
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,320
Who dares to laugh?

377
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,760
The bride isn't obedient

378
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,520
and the mother-in-law can't reprimand?

379
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,360
If she wants to kneel,

380
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,425
we won't give her water

381
00:17:25,425 --> 00:17:26,200
for a day and a night.

382
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,840
We'll see if she agrees then!

383
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,520
To shove a chambermaid

384
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,560
into the newly-weds' room.

385
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,080
Indeed it's not glorious after all.

386
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,400
By custom,

387
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,400
it's not wrong,

388
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,880
but as for the sense,

389
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,760
it's not quite convincing.

390
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,160
Eldest Sister-in-law,

391
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,920
what do you mean by that?

392
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,720
Is this what you want?

393
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,080
You want this old woman to apologize to her?

394
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,920
Fourth Sister-in-law, what do you mean?

395
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,040
This was always

396
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,640
a private matter of my house.

397
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,700
Fourth Sister,

398
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,360
you are just being candid and direct.

399
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,480
I can't let you

400
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,000
clean up this mess.

401
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,120
If she wants to kneel, let her do it.

402
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,000
Once she's had enough of kneeling,

403
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,680
she'll close her doors and reflect!

404
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,360
We need to live

405
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,240
under the same eaves after all,

406
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,280
so I can't let it go too stiff.

407
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,360
Let's do this.

408
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,240
Let me make the trip.

409
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,360
I'll go to invite her back.

410
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,280
Eldest Sister-in-law!

411
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,760
The Eldest Sister-in-law

412
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,280
is too gentle!

413
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,200
You can be kind,

414
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,520
but you can't let them bully you!

415
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,320
She's riding on her neck already!

416
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,040
I'll say the house isn't good!

417
00:18:47,975 --> 00:18:49,770
Why do you bother putting in

418
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,770
so much passion to worry about her?

419
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,440
Eldest Sister-in-law first laments to us

420
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,840
how Hongxiao has nowhere to go.

421
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,760
Talking about how pitiful she was?

422
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,960
She had us stand up for her

423
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,440
and knock into the nail for her,

424
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,200
and now she acts like she's the good person.

425
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,120
The good reputation is on her

426
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,520
and the bad deed is done by us.

427
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,600
This is called "gentle"?

428
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,440
I . . . huh?

429
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,880
You are too quick-tempered, child.

430
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,680
When did I blame you?

431
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,600
Hurry and rise.

432
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,040
Mother-in-law.

433
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,240
I can't even resolve a small matter.

434
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,280
I can't ease your worry

435
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,120
and I can't answer

436
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,240
to my husband.

437
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I really have no place to stand,

438
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,120
and Miss Hongxiao is so pitiful.

439
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,600
It's not too late to wait until

440
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,880
my husband is back to decide.

441
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,800
So just let me kneel.

442
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,840
Hurry and get up now!

443
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,120
Second Son is quick-tempered

444
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,680
and you're newly-weds.

445
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,200
If you have a disagreement

446
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,640
over a concubine

447
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,720
my offense as the mother

448
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,960
would be so grave then.

449
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,920
Maybe

450
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,975
my husband on the account of

451
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:10,800
years of old affection,

452
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,160
maybe he'll take in Miss Hongxiao.

453
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:14,880
But,

454
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,960
I don't dare to make the decision on my own.

455
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,160
I need to wait until my husband is back

456
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,680
and report to him first.

457
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,840
No need to.

458
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,600
As for Hongxiao,

459
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,840
I'll go talking to her later.

460
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,000
We can't let a servant

461
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,640
make you two upset.

462
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,800
If the word gets out,

463
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,080
there will just be laughter.

464
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,360
Where would we place

465
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,560
our Gu House's reputation?

466
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,320
Alright.

467
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,200
Come back with me now.

468
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,080
Perhaps I should go to apologize to

469
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,240
Fourth Aunt-in-law first.

470
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,200
I was direct and talkative earlier,

471
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,960
and I might have offended her.

472
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,440
You just don't know!

473
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,040
You Fourth Aunt-in-law

474
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,280
is such a simple straight-shooter.

475
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,800
She'll forget

476
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,760
what she said.

477
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,680
Now,

478
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,280
she's eating breakfast happily.

479
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,480
I has gone so long

480
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,640
and you didn't come look for me!

481
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,475
You went for the "debating sprill"

482
00:21:29,475 --> 00:21:30,400
in the shrine.

483
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,400
A great show like that is something

484
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,680
I've never seen before.

485
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,600
Today I've been enlightened.

486
00:21:39,635 --> 00:21:40,920
To think of the past,

487
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,920
I would be home all the time,

488
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,160
just go up and fight them directly.

489
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,400
What a plight that was!

490
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,640
How can you laugh?

491
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,560
You told me you

492
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,920
wouldn't let me suffer.

493
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,720
That whatever your rank is among men,

494
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,240
that is my rank among women.

495
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,960
The first day I am married here,

496
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,120
I was pushed to kneel

497
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,240
at the family shrine.

498
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,075
I.

499
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,640
I never even knelt at my home even once!

500
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,520
What's wrong?

501
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,280
You're mad?

502
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,200
I told you not to go,

503
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,440
but you insisted going.

504
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,440
Now you have seen

505
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,240
how fierce the Big Madam is, right?

506
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,880
The Mistress Lin at my home.

507
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:35,400
She could cry

508
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,080
and faint as she wished too.

509
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,800
I thought she was pretty fierce.

510
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,720
But today, after seeing yours,

511
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,200
that is truly the look of a Bodhisattva

512
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,360
with the mannerisms of a saint!

513
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,320
In all matters, she doesn't need to open her mouth

514
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,440
and she has others speak for her stead instead.

515
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,400
The evil things are all done by others.

516
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,320
While she is shown to be very graceful,

517
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,840
with nothing for others to complain about.

518
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,400
How do you know she instructed the others?

519
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,920
The first day after marriage,

520
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,350
and trying to stuff a maid

521
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,000
into the son's room?

522
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,160
These matters,

523
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,480
if the legitimate mother doesn't consent,

524
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,360
how would others even dare?

525
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,325
That straight-shooter

526
00:23:07,325 --> 00:23:08,320
Fourth Aunt-in-law of yours must

527
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,360
have heard her lament to her,

528
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,400
making her so eager to protect

529
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,240
her sister-in-law and give me trouble.

530
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,040
You even guessed that?

531
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,815
Did Scholar Zhuang teach you

532
00:23:23,815 --> 00:23:26,000
war strategies too back then?

533
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,475
In the interior courtyard,

534
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:30,160
these are the common matters.

535
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,560
Once you can get a clear sight

536
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,880
and understanding of these,

537
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,500
it's actually pretty similar

538
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,625
to fighting wars I think.

539
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,680
This time, I used retreat as

540
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,920
advancement and defense as offense.

541
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,880
I fear I've offended

542
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,600
my mother-in-law thoroughly.

543
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,900
In the future,

544
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,500
there won't be any cease of

545
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,020
open and secret attacks.

546
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,440
What's to be scared of?

547
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,040
I have your back.

548
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,850
If

549
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:52,040
she wants to stuff

550
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,760
another maid in ever again,

551
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,080
you can just reject it right away

552
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,240
and say I am not willing.

553
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,160
I definitely won't,

554
00:23:59,160 --> 00:23:59,750
and even if you convince

555
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,760
and make a hole in the sky, I still won't.

556
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,600
His Majesty wants me

557
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,880
to ease the transition from old to new,

558
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,160
so he's having me stay

559
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,600
at Gu House a bit more.

560
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,100
But if you're not willing,

561
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,160
we'll turn around and move to Cheng Garden.

562
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,000
Actually,

563
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,400
I think that Hongxiao,

564
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,560
does seem quite pitiful.

565
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,840
She did serve you for so long after all.

566
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,040
Maybe...

567
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,080
You feel,

568
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,520
I should take in Hongxiao?

569
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,840
You're not jealous?

570
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,040
You're not afraid that

571
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,360
they'll say you abandoned her after use?

572
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,880
That Hongxiao is indeed pitiful.

573
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,920
But I wasn't the one who abandoned her.

574
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,760
They were framing me on purpose.

575
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,460
They can frame with these matters too?

576
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,840
Of course.

577
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,760
Back then, it was the husband of the Fourth House

578
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,840
that was smitten with Hongxiao.

579
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,160
But he was scared that Big Madam of his

580
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,640
wouldn't let him take her in.

581
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,600
So on a dark and windy night,

582
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,240
he made her faint

583
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,480
and raped Hongxiao.

584
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,440
After she woke up,

585
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,920
and all she can do is cry.

586
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,720
She can't remember a thing.

587
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,680
And the blame is mine

588
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,000
back then for frequent brothel patronizing.

589
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,400
Every time something like this happens,

590
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,960
they blamed it on me

591
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,560
and I couldn't argue my way out.

592
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,000
So,

593
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,075
I had no choice

594
00:25:26,075 --> 00:25:27,240
but have them push Hongxiao into my room.

595
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,840
You don't believe me?

596
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,480
I believe you. I do.

597
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,200
Looking at your attitude,

598
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,640
you seem to be patronizing me.

599
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,640
It's not true.

600
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,550
Whether I believe it or not,

601
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,240
it's all the past.

602
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,480
If I clench on it and won't let it go now,

603
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,880
that's no fun.

604
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,430
If in the future,

605
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:53,320
you really intend to have a concubine,

606
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,360
as long as the person is of a good character

607
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,880
and can get along,

608
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,480
I can live in harmony

609
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,760
with them too.

610
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,000
Did I say something wrong?

611
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:10,640
It's correct.

612
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,480
Everything you say is correct.

613
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,880
You are a virtuous Big Madam.

614
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,320
Let's go.

615
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,440
Get dressed.

616
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,440
I'm taking you out.

617
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,920
Go out? Where?

618
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,360
I'll take you to Fan House.

619
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,320
You said you've never been there before

620
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,840
and I'll show you the sights.

621
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,480
We're going today?

622
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,080
You said your sisters went before

623
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,280
but only you didn't.

624
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,450
So today,

625
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,600
I must take you there.

626
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,000
Then...

627
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,320
Would it be...

628
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,950
Would it be

629
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,040
unruly?

630
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:56,160
If I were someone who is rule-bound,

631
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,120
I wouldn't like you then.

632
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,240
I don't have my shoes on yet.

633
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,520
I heard that about Ye's wife,

634
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,120
after you escorted her out personally

635
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,000
from the family shrine,

636
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,680
the Fourth and Fifth Madams

637
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,139
were quite angry

638
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,560
The Fourth House sister

639
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,080
started to swear and complain.

640
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,680
Speaking such ugly words.

641
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,040
What did she say?

642
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,840
She said

643
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,320
Of course she said you were using her to do bad things.

644
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,800
The evil deeds are done by others

645
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,240
and bad name carried by them.

646
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,840
Good reputation are all yours.

647
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,760
It was fake.

648
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,520
Did Fifth House say anything?

649
00:27:59,480 --> 00:27:59,960
She . .

650
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,240
She didn't say anything.

651
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,360
She's so clever

652
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,525
and she's great at watching the fire burn

653
00:28:07,525 --> 00:28:08,200
without doing anything.

654
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,120
If it weren't for her cue,

655
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,280
the one in the Fourth House,

656
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,480
I imagine she still

657
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,880
wouldn't have a clear clue by now!

658
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,640
ungrateful soul!

659
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,160
When the old Marquis was alive,

660
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,240
I helped Fourth and Fifth Houses

661
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,960
cover up so much.

662
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,400
So?

663
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,360
After Second Son is transformed,

664
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,560
and his new bride

665
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,320
is also a tough-boned one who isn't easy to deal with,

666
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,280
so they want to sail off now?

667
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,360
It's not that easy.

668
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,160
Anyone who tarnished Old Second back then,

669
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,440
none of them can be clean.

670
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,200
If anyone tries to turn

671
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,240
and shed their dirt off now,

672
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,440
I will just reveal

673
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,640
all their deeds now!

674
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,880
I'll see who Second Son will forgive!

675
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,760
You're right, Big Madam.

676
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,160
Those two houses

677
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,000
can't rile up many waves.

678
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,440
But the wife of the Old Second

679
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,680
is not an easy match.

680
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,320
She's not someone who can be

681
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,840
put off by common measures.

682
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,640
Why are you in such a hurry?

683
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,560
The days are long.

684
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,200
Yes.

685
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,475
What?

686
00:29:34,475 --> 00:29:36,400
You're moving out?

687
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,640
How can that be?

688
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,240
His Majesty granted me a manor

689
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,080
so why can't I move?

690
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,640
And it's so close to the marquis manor.

691
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,120
Back to back,

692
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,400
and easy to travel back and forth.

693
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,255
An Imperial grant is one thing,

694
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,760
but it's up to you to move or not.

695
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,800
Our dynasty is built on filial devotion.

696
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,440
Your parents are here,

697
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,720
how can you set up a separate manor?

698
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,625
Filial devotion?

699
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,000
The mother has to be devoted

700
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,040
for the son to be filial.

701
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,960
Fourth and Fifth Aunt-in-laws,

702
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,680
and the one sitting here.

703
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,600
They bullied my bride together,

704
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,200
so what filial devotion do we discuss?

705
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,440
What is this?

706
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,720
What? So outrageous.

707
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,320
Who bullied your bride?

708
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,325
I suppose

709
00:30:31,325 --> 00:30:32,960
Fourth and Fifth Aunt-in-laws

710
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,040
didn't tell you at home?

711
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,040
They must feel it's not glorious either.

712
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,040
Everyone says,

713
00:30:39,361 --> 00:30:40,775
take it easy on the first three days

714
00:30:40,775 --> 00:30:41,520
after the wedding.

715
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:42,800
But they are so great.

716
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,075
First day,

717
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:45,720
and they had my bride kneel at the shrine.

718
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,480
What is their intention?

719
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,560
What?

720
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,560
Eldest Sister-in-law. Is that really true?

721
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,320
Can't be.

722
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,986
That Hongxiao.

723
00:31:01,986 --> 00:31:03,760
She was seeking death.

724
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:04,680
I.

725
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,160
I just couldn't stop her.

726
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,080
Dear second son!

727
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,680
This is your fault here.

728
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,880
Since Hongxiao

729
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,560
was in your room back then,

730
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,550
and now you've married

731
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,640
and set yourself up in name,

732
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,960
you should look after her sensely.

733
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,080
Seriously!

734
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,080
Whose room is Hongxiao from?

735
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,800
You people don't know

736
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,200
whose room she's from?

737
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,720
Don't push me to the edge

738
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,320
or I'll speak ugly words!

739
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,160
W-Whose room is she from?

740
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,120
not yours?

741
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,000
Back then...

742
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:38,760
Fifth Brother-in-law,

743
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,200
forget it.

744
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,800
If Second Son isn't willing,

745
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,640
don't force him.

746
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,400
We don't need to let a servant

747
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,800
disrupt our own harmony.

748
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,680
Eldest Sister-in-law,

749
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,280
we're trying to seek justice for you!

750
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,075
If you can have a moment of forbearance,

751
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,080
you can have a very short peaceful time.

752
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,920
Our Gu House can't afford anymore turbulence.

753
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,000
As for the Hongxiao matter,

754
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,200
maybe

755
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,840
just let me be the evildoer.

756
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,600
No, no. Let's not compromise you.

757
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,200
Just hand Hongxiao to me,

758
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,000
and I will have my wife

759
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,160
find a good family for her.

760
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,560
That way

761
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,800
we can preserve the clean reputation of Gu House,

762
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,560
and my wife and I can have some peace too.

763
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,320
That'll work.

764
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,280
Fine.

765
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,600
Didn't you say you were moving out earlier?

766
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,200
How are we talking about

767
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,640
Hongxiao instead?

768
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:42,520
Yes!

769
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,880
Yes!

770
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,540
Yes,

771
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,240
who got us on Hongxiao?

772
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,360
At any rate,

773
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,800
I am determined on moving.

774
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,200
Today,

775
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,200
I only came to let you know.

776
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,560
Whether you agree or not,

777
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,680
I am still moving.

778
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,600
Eldest Sister-in-law hasn't consented

779
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,520
and you decided on your own?

780
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,120
Do you even have the Gu elders

781
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,800
in your eyes?

782
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,050
Fifth Uncle,

783
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:11,880
if you say that,

784
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,480
you are making Big Madam hold a reputation

785
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,240
of greed for money.

786
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,320
What?

787
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,920
I came back with victory

788
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,480
and His Majesty granted me uncountable amounts.

789
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,560
Plus all the rich assets of my Bai family.

790
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,440
If Big Madam clings on

791
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,800
and won't let go and when the word gets out,

792
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,280
those people would think Big Madam

793
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,560
dotes on me and my wife.

794
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,000
But those don't know,

795
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,840
they would think Big Madam

796
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,720
was covet my assets.

797
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,320
Where is that talking coming from?

798
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,482
Public opinion is enough to melt gold.

799
00:33:49,482 --> 00:33:50,920
Gossip is a fearful thing!

800
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,880
One relays it to another,

801
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,440
and a fake can be relayed as truth.

802
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,200
At that time,

803
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,480
even if you're full of mouths,

804
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,920
you can't explain clearly.

805
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,800
You're heavily-trusted and promoted

806
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,920
so if you wish to move, just move.

807
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,040
There's no need for the spear attack.

808
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,275
I thank you, Big Madam,

809
00:34:15,275 --> 00:34:16,520
for your great understanding.

810
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:18,880
I won't bother

811
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,920
my older brother then.

812
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,480
Please let him know.

813
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,840
I still have military duty awaiting me,

814
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,120
so I'll leave now.

815
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,520
What!

816
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,880
Does he even care

817
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,120
about respecting elders?

818
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,960
What an impropriety!

819
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:39,880
Eldest Sister-in-law,

820
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,760
you need to teach him better!

821
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,320
The child has grown up.

822
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,640
He doesn't listen anymore.

823
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,560
What!

824
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,280
Though Second Brother has progressed

825
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,320
compared to before,

826
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,640
he still hasn't shed

827
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,800
his childish ways.

828
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,880
He thought moving out

829
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,600
can make a clear cut from Gu Family?

830
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,760
What?

831
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,548
Cheng Garden

832
00:35:10,548 --> 00:35:12,600
is our neighbor.

833
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,720
His Majesty did it intentionally.

834
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,800
To have Old Second have some honor

835
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,280
and some authority in Gu House.

836
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,520
But to cue him secretly too.

837
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,920
His family name is Gu after all,

838
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,680
and the two houses can't separate!

839
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,520
Just wait and see.

840
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,320
This matter isn't finished.

841
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,960
Our aunts and the Big Madam

842
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,480
will find a way

843
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,640
to continue to torment him.

844
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,600
How will they torment him?

845
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,440
If I'm gone in the future,

846
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,640
without any mishaps,

847
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,560
it will be Old Second who inherits the title.

848
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,175
At the time,

849
00:35:54,175 --> 00:35:55,720
if he doesn't move back,

850
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,320
how will he be Marquis of Ningyuan?

851
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,120
Stop talking like that.

852
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,480
Your health,

853
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,240
there's still hope for recovery.

854
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,120
Forget it.

855
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,640
I've carried on all these years,

856
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,920
and it's been tough.

857
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,240
I know my body.

858
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,960
At least for Xian and I,

859
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,000
you have to move on.

860
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,080
Even if you're not the Marquis

861
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,760
and you're not surnamed Gu

862
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,600
I still don't want to part from you.

863
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,840
Alright, alright.

864
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,800
I promise you,

865
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,920
for you and our daughter,

866
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,360
I will carry on.

867
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,200
I'll continue this struggle with them.

868
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,880
This Cheng Garden

869
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,225
used to house a high minister

870
00:37:02,225 --> 00:37:03,240
of the previous dynasty.

871
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,720
Later, he retired to his hometown

872
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,760
and His Majesty

873
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,560
reclaimed the manor.

874
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,600
It was left to ruin all these years

875
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,000
until it was granted to me.

876
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,040
Without counting the forest front and back,

877
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,440
this manor stands more than six hectare in area.

878
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,120
There are two parts, front and back.

879
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,920
Front court, I will be in charge.

880
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,222
Back court

881
00:37:23,222 --> 00:37:24,480
is the inner courtyard,

882
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,680
and you're in charge.

883
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,400
Your turf, and you're the boss.

884
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,640
Such a grand manor

885
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,360
and just the two of us living here?

886
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,800
Look at you, little silly thing.

887
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,360
You're drooling.

888
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,400
How is this grand?

889
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,240
Marquis Xiangyang's manor is what's big.

890
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,920
You have to go around on horseback

891
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,240
to see the whole yard!

892
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,520
I think this place is distinct.

893
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,080
I've seen a few grand manors

894
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,160
in the capital before.

895
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,480
But compared to this yard,

896
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,240
this place is more bright and more airy.

897
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,360
You have good discernment.

898
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,025
His Majesty had us choose

899
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,400
when he granted

900
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,280
these yards to us.

901
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:09,960
When I was picking,

902
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,560
I was fond of this place at first sight.

903
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,240
I knew this place

904
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,720
would please you.

905
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,240
At the time,

906
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,800
you didn't even proposed yet!

907
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,560
You already thought of all that?

908
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,000
I am just one person

909
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,400
and it doesn't matter where I live.

910
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,000
But now I have a family.

911
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,560
I needed to find a good place

912
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,160
that is worthy of you.

913
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,760
Then this place is still too...

914
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,760
I've lived with my grandmother since I was little.

915
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,880
Later when I was put to be in charge of the house,

916
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,720
I then had my own courtyard,

917
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:52,680
but it was all very small.

918
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,200
You suddenly

919
00:38:54,525 --> 00:38:56,560
give me this huge yard.

920
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,138
I'm afraid

921
00:38:58,138 --> 00:38:59,800
I can't manage it well.

922
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,475
First time is unfamiliar

923
00:39:01,475 --> 00:39:02,400
but the second time is familiar.

924
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,280
Who knows how to manage

925
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,600
this stuff at birth?

926
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:06,675
Right?

927
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,560
And also,

928
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,960
I am not having you

929
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,920
be the prime minister or a general.

930
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:12,950
This yard,

931
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:13,828
if you want to manage it,

932
00:39:13,828 --> 00:39:14,640
manage it.

933
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,684
If you don't want to manage it,

934
00:39:15,684 --> 00:39:17,040
toss it to others to manage.

935
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,520
At any rate, I just want you to

936
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,520
be easy and smooth to all your life,

937
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,680
and be my wife.

938
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,000
You...

939
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,240
You say it so easily.

940
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,840
But you have your reputation as General Gu.

941
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:33,960
If this wife of yours

942
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,960
is muddled with matters,

943
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,320
dumb and incompetent,

944
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,160
all your colleagues will tease you

945
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:38,960
to death!

946
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,280
You're muddled?

947
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,320
You're dumb?

948
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,480
Who would believe that?

949
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,680
You

950
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,680
don't need to worry about the gossipers.

951
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,040
What I said

952
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,120
the day I proposed to you,

953
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,560
counts forever.

954
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,240
Then let me try it.

955
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,225
Yes,

956
00:40:09,225 --> 00:40:10,320
there you go.

957
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,960
After we visit your parents tomorrow,

958
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,280
all the moving matters

959
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,280
are up to you.

960
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:17,225
Whatever money and

961
00:40:17,225 --> 00:40:18,440
whatever manpower you need.

962
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,400
If that Big Madam comes and says something

963
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,360
just ignore her.

964
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,560
Sixth Sister.

965
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,520
Sixth Sister.

966
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,520
Hello, Fifth Sister.

967
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,880
Fifth Brother-in-law.

968
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,600
Look at you.

969
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,440
You're really a phoenix

970
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,000
on a high branch now.

971
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,080
The entourage grandness you have.

972
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,840
It's no less than that of a princess.

973
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,160
This is granted by His Majesty.

974
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,325
Your brother-in-law said

975
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,960
we should have His Majesty see it,

976
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,720
Don't let him down.

977
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,640
It's great.

978
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:04,738
Fourth Brother-in-law,

979
00:41:04,738 --> 00:41:05,840
Fourth Sister, greetings.

980
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,800
You're back.

981
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,240
Second Brother. Greetings, Second Brother.

982
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,040
Come on in.

983
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,200
Greetings, Sister-in-law.

984
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,160
Greetings, Third Brother.

985
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,960
Come on in.

986
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,120
Come on in.

987
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,480
A petty man showing off.

988
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,760
What's there to see?

989
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,325
I told you not to come,

990
00:41:22,325 --> 00:41:23,360
but you just wanted to come.

991
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,520
You come and you get mad.

992
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,440
Why, bother?

993
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,100
I said we should come

994
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,240
in the three-tiered carriage

995
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,280
but you wouldn't.

996
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,280
We are a noble family too

997
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,120
and we pale in comparison!

998
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,200
Alright. Next time,

999
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,600
I will get the carriage for you.

1000
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,160
Ming!

1001
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,280
Grandmother, Grandmother.

1002
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:46,440
Ming.

1003
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,320
Let me take a good look at you.

1004
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,320
I've not shed one strand of hair

1005
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,360
and I've not lost one piece of flesh.

1006
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,080
I didn't lose any either.

1007
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,200
Naughty.

1008
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,575
You have to go again

1009
00:42:06,575 --> 00:42:07,400
when it's dark.

1010
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,775
Once you leave,

1011
00:42:09,775 --> 00:42:11,000
I don't know when

1012
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,640
you can be back again.

1013
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,560
Let me see more.

1014
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,030
Grandmother,

1015
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:19,920
this is easy.

1016
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,480
If Minglan misses home, it's fine for her to

1017
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,320
come back anytime.

1018
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,640
I can come back with her too

1019
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,560
and live here a few days.

1020
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,625
You needn't worry,

1021
00:42:25,625 --> 00:42:26,200
Grandmother.

1022
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,120
You can bear it?

1023
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,600
Is there any reason not to?

1024
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,840
It's all thanks to your consent that

1025
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,240
I can have

1026
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,560
such a great wife.

1027
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,520
Old Madam.

1028
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,520
Master sent someone to tell you

1029
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,080
something came up in the palace.

1030
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,325
He can't put it off,

1031
00:42:46,325 --> 00:42:47,370
so he needs to go.

1032
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,040
He's asked Sixth Miss and Sixth Son-in-law

1033
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,840
to go and meet Big Madam's first.

1034
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,760
They'll come back after the meal.

1035
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,440
He can just tend to his work.

1036
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,520
Yes.

1037
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,640
You go and pay respects

1038
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,080
to Big Madam first.

1039
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,960
Then come back to me

1040
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,880
and we'll catch up.

1041
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:04,880
Yes.
