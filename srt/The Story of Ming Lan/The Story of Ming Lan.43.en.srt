00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Ming Lan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,580
Episode 43

3
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,840
Wife, I'm taking off my clothes.

4
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,920
Look at this big long leg of mine.

5
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,080
Stop reading.

6
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,680
You can't finish it today.

7
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,720
Just leave it tomorrow.

8
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,560
This house

9
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,440
has so many spies from the Marquis Manor.

10
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,760
How can‘t I be anxious?

11
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,160
Danju said that

12
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,760
a new maidservant today

13
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,040
wanted to enter your inner study to attend to you,

14
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,720
but got scolded away by her.

15
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,840
And this Nanny Lai

16
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,280
isn't that easy to deal with.

17
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,625
When she was not doing anything,

18
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:13,760
she would go around the garden

19
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,720
and enter any door she sees,

20
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,520
grab anyone she sees and ask around.

21
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,300
But I can't really stuff her mouth

22
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,160
to shut her up.

23
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,240
It's better to drive her away as soon as possible.

24
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,200
How come you can't just stuff her mouth

25
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:26,720
and make her leave?

26
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,000
I'll tell Shitou

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,040
to lock that old woman up tomorrow.

28
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,640
Aren't you oppressing the old and weak?

29
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,400
If that gets out,

30
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,440
do you still want your reputation or not?

31
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,440
How about when I go to court tomorrow,

32
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,800
I'll leave some guards

33
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,875
to guard here.

34
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,640
In the places that you think are very important,

35
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,880
I'll leave two people

36
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,760
holding blades to guard there.

37
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,700
Let's see who still dares

38
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,640
to randomly touch things.

39
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,960
It looks like that Big Madam Qin

40
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,920
is attacking me from two angles at the same time.

41
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,200
Sending me some old crafty servants

42
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,520
to add my trouble on one hand.

43
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,560
and then simultaneously sending

44
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,520
beautiful ones to seduce you.

45
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,840
She really gave a lot of thought to this.

46
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,750
Beautiful?

47
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,520
How beautiful?

48
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,760
They are indeed quite pretty.

49
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,160
How about...

50
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,520
tomorrow...

51
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,320
I'll let them

52
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,840
serve us when we eat,

53
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,240
then you'll be able to see them.

54
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,960
I'm just joking with you,

55
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,200
but look at you.

56
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,120
You got serious about it.

57
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:45,825
you're going to take

58
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:46,640
a concubine in the future anyway,

59
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,680
and I'm not jealous.

60
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,120
I'm just worried

61
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,240
that those people are inappropriate.

62
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,880
Why are you not jealous?

63
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,400
Even that stepmother of mine

64
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,720
who can really pretend

65
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,000
and endure things

66
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,160
would still argue with my father

67
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,720
about such things.

68
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,640
Why are you not jealous?

69
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,675
That jealousy of hers

70
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,915
must be pretentious too!

71
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,480
In my house, there was a Mistress Lin.

72
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,400
When she got jealous,

73
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,600
she would also do a lot of things.

74
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,120
Isn't it all just to make their husband

75
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,600
think that in their hearts,

76
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
he is so precious and important?

77
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,560
You little fox!

78
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,950
Can't you just pretend for a little while?

79
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,440
If you dare take in a concubine,

80
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,880
I'll hit you with a huge pole and throw you out!

81
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,480
I'll never allow you

82
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,920
to enter my room.

83
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,040
Okay! Okay!Okay!

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,240
That's how my good wife should be!

85
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,000
Being jealous is good!

86
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:54,920
Come.Come.

87
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,480
Let me read that for you. I'll help you read it.

88
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,400
I...let me help you! Let me help you!

89
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,120
Come...

90
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,200
Thank you, Sister.

91
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,080
So heavy?

92
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,600
With such a small box,

93
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,800
this is really heavy.

94
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,400
Is this filled

95
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,480
with gold and silver?

96
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,480
Not only that.

97
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,640
There are a lot of precious gems too.

98
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,800
Outside,

99
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,080
there are carts and carts of fabrics.

100
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,720
We have to transport each one of them

101
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,680
to the stockroom of the inner house.

102
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,560
I will surely be busy with this the whole day.

103
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,080
With so many good objects,

104
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,560
where did they come from?

105
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,280
Is it Big Madam's dowry?

106
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,360
Still not done moving them?

107
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,920
You must be joking.

108
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,320
How is that possible?

109
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,160
These are all gifts given

110
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,120
by other people to the General.

111
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,480
Not only that,

112
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,720
there are still a lot of people outside,

113
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,120
waiting in lines.

114
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,440
They've been placed at a corner.

115
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,120
So many things waiting for us.

116
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,600
Big Madam just accepted all of them?

117
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,160
Maybe so.

118
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,240
With so many good items being delivered

119
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,400
right in front of her,

120
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,560
would she still refuse them?

121
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,720
Is she stupid?

122
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,120
Sister, hurry up!

123
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,360
Come on

124
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,200
Have you settled down the people

125
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,320
sent by the Marquis Manor?

126
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,200
More or less.

127
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,120
I've given them unimportant tasks.

128
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,400
For the important areas,

129
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,880
I've appoited people I can trust.

130
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,720
Later, I'll tell Eldest Sister

131
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,400
to find me some new ones.

132
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,560
New servants have no foundation.

133
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,840
They will follow my order.

134
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,560
They won't work for the Marquis Manor.

135
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,880
Based on my temper,

136
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,200
I'll just drive them all back

137
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,760
to the Marquis Manor.

138
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,880
Just blame it on me that

139
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,120
I hate all those old servants.

140
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,000
My husband,

141
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,325
you're just dealing with the problem temporarily

142
00:07:18,325 --> 00:07:18,840
to avert a crisis,

143
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,960
and not completely solving it.

144
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,560
To send them back to the Marquis Manor

145
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,235
can't stop your aunties and stepmother

146
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,880
from criticizing me,

147
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,840
you can't use force.

148
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,200
Some people in the Imperial court

149
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,825
might report you

150
00:07:34,825 --> 00:07:36,080
as not cultivating private morality,

151
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,320
and being disrespectful to your elders.

152
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,425
Aren't you satisfied yet with

153
00:07:40,425 --> 00:07:41,600
how you got taken advantage of before?

154
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,720
My wife...

155
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,625
You've become a military adviser that schemes

156
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:47,400
in the demanding center!

157
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,480
Stop being talkative.

158
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,080
Okay.

159
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,200
It's okay now.

160
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,560
Okay. Just go.

161
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,280
Take this!

162
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,040
Do you still need me to guard you?

163
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,080
No need to. Just go.

164
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,040
Let's go.

165
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,320
A carriage from the Marquis Manor?

166
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,400
Big Madam Qin is here?

167
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,840
She must has some bad intentions.

168
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,640
You guys, come over here.

169
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,720
Go to the drill area

170
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,200
and inform Generals Geng and Duan

171
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,000
that I have some matters

172
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,240
in my house and will be delayed.

173
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,400
I'll arrive an hour later.

174
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,520
Yes!

175
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,840
Young Master.

176
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,080
Later,

177
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,640
I'll be waiting in the outer courtyard study room.

178
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,840
Don't be loud,

179
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,280
and just keep watching in the inner courtyard.

180
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,120
Once Big Madam is unable to handle it,

181
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,280
immediately tell me

182
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,480
and I'll help her out of the situation.

183
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,720
Okay, Young Master. Let's go.

184
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,040
Greetings, Mother-in-law.

185
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,550
I should be the one going to

186
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,680
the Marquis Manor to greet you.

187
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,625
I was too busy moving

188
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:20,720
and cleaning up these past days.

189
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,280
Mother-in-law, hope you won't mind.

190
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,600
I knew that you were busy moving,

191
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,560
so I didn't come for the past a few days.

192
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,120
Are those servants

193
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,000
I sent you a few days ago

194
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,360
being useful?

195
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,800
You are so considerate,

196
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,880
so of course,

197
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,960
you chose the most capable people.

198
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,360
I thank you for it, Mother-in-law.

199
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,480
If they are honest and capable,

200
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,040
how come you're still not giving tasks

201
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,240
to Nanny Lai and Nanny Diao?

202
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,680
Could it be because they are old,

203
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,600
so you think

204
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,760
they aren't nimble in doing their tasks?

205
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,760
No such thing.

206
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,880
Nanny Diao has a sickly body.

207
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,120
I was afraid that she'd tire herself out.

208
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,160
Nanny Lai

209
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,320
is a well-experienced servant.

210
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,800
I'm thinking that

211
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,240
I should give her an important

212
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,680
and honorable job, right?

213
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,325
So I keep weighing things

214
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:16,520
and I am still unable to decide.

215
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,640
Since you seem to know what to do,

216
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,360
I'm at ease.

217
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,640
Otherwise, if others find out,

218
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,160
they might think

219
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,520
that I'm a miser.

220
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,250
That what I gave you are old, weak,

221
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,240
and disabled servants.

222
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,100
Mother-in-law, you've always

223
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:31,960
had a virtuous reputation.

224
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,120
Whoever in the capital cityCity doesn't know that

225
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,560
you have a Bodhisattva-like heart?

226
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,400
Even if anyone will say such words,

227
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,480
no one will believe them.

228
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,000
The reputation of a widow

229
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,320
isn't really that important.

230
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,120
What's important is

231
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,760
the reputation of our Gu Family.

232
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,320
If you lack anything,

233
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,120
just send people

234
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,200
to get it from me.

235
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,720
Why you privately accept gifts

236
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,920
and hide it from your husband?

237
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,240
What are you saying?

238
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,680
There's no such thing.

239
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,960
You still want to hide it from me?

240
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,360
Since Ye got promoted,

241
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,280
people haven't stopped

242
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,440
sending him gifts.

243
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,400
You didn't inquire about them

244
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,240
and just accepted them all.

245
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,800
If His Majesty asks about this,

246
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,960
won't it be your husband and our Gu Family

247
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,120
bearing the brunt?

248
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,200
Although the imposing bearing of our Marquis Manor

249
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,280
isn't as great as before,

250
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,080
our reputation

251
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,560
has always been good.

252
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,280
You want it

253
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,840
destroyed in your hands?

254
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,640
I...

255
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,320
really didn't accept any gifts.

256
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,640
The General said that

257
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,225
the current Imperial court situation

258
00:11:40,225 --> 00:11:40,800
isn't that stable.

259
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,760
If I don't accept all of them,

260
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,520
that's being enemies with everyone.

261
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,760
If I nitpick and accept only a few,

262
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,920
that's forming alliances or factions.

263
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,680
It's better to just accept them all,

264
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,000
but not open them.

265
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,880
He'll just inform His Majesty about it.

266
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,075
The items will be placed

267
00:11:56,075 --> 00:11:57,520
in the stockroom of the courtyard

268
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,320
and submitted to His Majesty

269
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,760
all of them.

270
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,160
Ye

271
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,800
has really grown up.

272
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,080
He actually

273
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,360
is this scheming and shrewd.

274
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,280
If I didn't know,

275
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,280
I would have thought that

276
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,080
he was just

277
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,840
pretending in the past.

278
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,040
Mother-in-law, don't praise him.

279
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,360
If he's really shrewd,

280
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,650
he wouldn't have wandered outside

281
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:34,360
for so many years,

282
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,160
unable to pass the civil examination.

283
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,520
He had to rely on himself to achieve merits

284
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,480
through his sword and spear.

285
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,000
It was really hard for my husband

286
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,280
to achieve what he has now.

287
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,440
Although as his wife, I'm indeed a bit ignorant,

288
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:47,800
I do understand

289
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,150
the principle of husband and wife being united,

290
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:49,720
of sharing blessings

291
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,440
and going through hardships together.

292
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,160
I just speak one sentence,

293
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,480
and you have ten waiting for me.

294
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,280
Young Master!

295
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,160
How are things going?

296
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,160
Don't worry. She has left.

297
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,840
She has left?

298
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,280
She didn't cause any trouble?

299
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,400
She didn't.

300
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,880
It's very quiet in the inner courtyard.

301
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,520
I especially hid behind a tree to watch them.

302
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,520
That lady from the Marquis Manor

303
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,480
was so upsset when she left that

304
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,520
her face almost touched the ground!

305
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,320
My stepmother has finally

306
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,760
met her opponant.

307
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,480
My previous act

308
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,400
of directly punching my fist into them

309
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:29,925
is really not as good

310
00:13:29,925 --> 00:13:30,720
as using a soft nail tactic.

311
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,920
Let's go to the drill field.

312
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,760
Let's go.

313
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,920
What are you laughing at?

314
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,400
Young Master, your face earlier

315
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,560
really looked like a hen

316
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,880
protecting her chicks.

317
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,960
Go away!

318
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,160
Don't let me use a small cup.

319
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,120
Quickly change it to a huge bowl.

320
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,360
Miss, Big Madam,

321
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,000
that is too inappropriate.

322
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,680
I'll just pour you more.

323
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,600
What's wrong with Big Madam?

324
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,600
Nanny Lai,

325
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,480
that old...thing,

326
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,760
keeps leisurely touring our manor

327
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,640
and asking around,

328
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,720
and then she'll report it to the Marquis Manor.

329
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,800
Otherwise, how could she have come this fast?

330
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,800
What can we do?

331
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,760
I can't really tie her up, right?

332
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,720
Morever, without her,

333
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,760
there are still other young

334
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,680
and old maidservants.

335
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,480
All those sent by the Marquis Manor

336
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,720
are their spies.

337
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,280
I can't really kick all of them out, right?

338
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,725
That Nanny Lai even

339
00:14:44,725 --> 00:14:46,000
likes to pretend to be a good person.

340
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,250
Always taking a group of old maidservants

341
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,000
to drink and gamble.

342
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:48,880
During just a few days,

343
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,680
they are already so close with each other.

344
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,175
Everyone is saying that she's very generous

345
00:14:52,175 --> 00:14:52,760
and straightforward.

346
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,920
They all follow her in everything.

347
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,280
She has worked in the Marquis Manor for decades.

348
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,520
For her to be like that

349
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,200
means she does have skills.

350
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,700
That mother-in-law of mine

351
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,560
is also not stupid.

352
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,160
How could she send over a useless person?

353
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,320
Since she's here,

354
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,360
then she's a thorny porcupine.

355
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,360
You can't hit, scold,

356
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,800
or expel her away.

357
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:13,875
I never thought

358
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:14,760
that despite moving out of the Marquis Manor,

359
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,800
it will still be so messed up.

360
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,400
So annoying.

361
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,400
Xiaotao is getting agitated.

362
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,640
Be careful of choking.

363
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,520
Big Madam, there is still a lot of pear soup.

364
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,280
Oh,right.

365
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,800
There's still a pile of books over there.

366
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,120
Big Madam, please take a look at them, too.

367
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,520
Cuiwei,

368
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,720
I really feel that

369
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,680
it's better to just be a miss

370
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,480
at Shouan Hall.

371
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,320
My good Miss, good Big Madam,

372
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,480
you now have great power.

373
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,960
All the people in the capital is envious of you.

374
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,920
Let's go and read them.

375
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,720
This manor is so huge.

376
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,600
Just the garden,

377
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,125
you won't be able to completely stroll it

378
00:15:59,125 --> 00:15:59,840
in half a day.

379
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,200
Asking just a few of us to clean it,

380
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,560
is really asking for our lives!

381
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,520
Big Madam said

382
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,640
that she's going to pick some reliable ones.

383
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,680
But it's already been half a day.

384
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,000
and there are still no one coming.

385
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,550
Could it be that the manor

386
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,080
has not enough money for expenses,

387
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,200
that she couldn't buy any servants anymore?

388
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,480
She can only talk.

389
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,440
Among the people here in this manor,

390
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,400
who doesn't have siblings or nephews and nieces

391
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,960
at home?

392
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,720
Call all those who are not doing anything

393
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,160
to come here for work.

394
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,200
Pick some smart and nimble ones to hire.

395
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,280
Won't that be more reliable than

396
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,480
those bought from outside? Am I right?

397
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,240
Right...

398
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,120
It's really better to work in the Marquis Manor.

399
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,480
Big Madam is a goddess, a Bodhisattva.

400
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,840
She also doesn't have

401
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,080
so many weird rules.

402
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,480
Those that work in the garden

403
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,040
are not allowed to enter the front courtyard,

404
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,720
not allowed to casually move around.

405
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,760
Prisoners might be more free than us.

406
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,000
Right!

407
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,240
You had better lower your voice.

408
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,800
our Big Madam

409
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,800
can really hold grudges.

410
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,840
I just interrupted her a few times

411
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,520
when we met her a few days ago.

412
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,560
She immediately punished my daughter.

413
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,030
She sent all those

414
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,200
first-class maids

415
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,080
who served Yong Masters

416
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,760
to plant trees!

417
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,000
Not putting any servant in Master's room

418
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,025
isn't the actions of a wife

419
00:17:25,025 --> 00:17:26,320
from a great aristocratic family.

420
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,160
She probably

421
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,320
is afraid that if Master sees

422
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,560
how beautiful your daughter is,

423
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,125
he might realize

424
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,275
how she pales in comparison to your daughter.

425
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,360
Indeed.

426
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,680
I can't be sure about that.

427
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,640
But to be honest,

428
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,840
she came from a family of officials.

429
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,520
Although she's an illegitimate daughter,

430
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,480
she shouldn't be that jealous, right?

431
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,160
What are you all saying?

432
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,525
Are you people even worthy

433
00:17:58,525 --> 00:17:59,560
to be seen by our Master?

434
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,400
Are you even worthy

435
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,120
to gossip about Big Madam?

436
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,000
Dirty shrews!

437
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,160
If you got put together, expelled out,

438
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,920
and thrown in the snow,

439
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,080
even beggars wouldn't take a second to look at you!

440
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,240
What did I say?

441
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,400
Miss Xiaotao,

442
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,080
don't you falsely accuse me.

443
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,080
So, you're the master of this house now?

444
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,040
You can just hire anyone you like.

445
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,080
let anyone you want

446
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:17,960
to serve in front of the Master?

447
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,760
If you're that capable,

448
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,200
why still order your daughter?

449
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,040
Why don't you go out,

450
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,960
walk around,

451
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
try to

452
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
find yourself a man to marry?

453
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,840
Miss,

454
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,520
why are you so rude and unreasonable?

455
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,520
At the very least,

456
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,400
I'm old enough to be your ancestor.

457
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,760
I just made a few jokes

458
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,520
while tending the ground.

459
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,440
How did that offend you, Miss?

460
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,480
Exactly.

461
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,840
Miss, you might have heard it wrong.

462
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,400
That is.

463
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,000
We didn't say anything.

464
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,400
Don't use this trick to fool me.

465
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,440
If I hear it again,

466
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,760
I won't need to inform Big Madam

467
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,720
to expel you all

468
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,480
with a stick in my hand!

469
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,480
Will she tell Big Madam

470
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,480
what we just said?

471
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,160
So what?

472
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,400
Can that Big Madam

473
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,920
Won't allow people to say she is being harsh on old servants

474
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,640
while she did be harsh on old servants

475
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,800
and disrepectful to her elders?

476
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,960
As a servant,

477
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,840
we shouldn't lower ourselves

478
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,625
and just let our master deal with us

479
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:17,360
in any way she wants, right?

480
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,440
If so, aren't we like pigs or dogs then?

481
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,480
If we don't want to get bullied,

482
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,400
we must stick together and be like a rope,

483
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,840
stay united and work together.

484
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,320
Only then can we make a footing in this manor.

485
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,640
That's right.

486
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,400
From now on,

487
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,400
We'll listen to you

488
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
from now on.

489
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,225
Yesterday, it was the birthday

490
00:19:40,225 --> 00:19:41,240
of Duke Ying of the State.

491
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,200
Rulan and I

492
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,800
accompanied mother to congrats him.

493
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,680
You were a heated

494
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,680
topic there.

495
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,880
They said that

496
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,700
you don't give any importance to your elders

497
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,760
and not filial your legitimate mother.

498
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,080
Big Madam Qin has a hard life as a widow,

499
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,360
yet was able to maintain such a good temper.

500
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,800
They said that you were late in greeting them

501
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,160
on the first day after your wedding.

502
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,440
That there is a legitimate mother yet,

503
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,425
but you have to move out

504
00:20:04,425 --> 00:20:05,360
and set up your own manor.

505
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,400
They were all saying that you were heartless.

506
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,400
What else?

507
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,640
There's still a lot.

508
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,080
They even said

509
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,240
you two are being harsh on your servants,

510
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,200
hitting and scolding old servants as your wish.

511
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,840
Not putting any importance to the people

512
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,680
your elders arranged for you.

513
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,320
That is equivalent to being supercilious

514
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,760
and not respect the elders.

515
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,920
There are still a lot of bad ones.

516
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,600
I don't want to say them anymore.

517
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,025
When mother and Rulan heard them,

518
00:20:30,025 --> 00:20:30,800
they were really mad,

519
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,960
but they couldn't really argue.

520
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,720
They were so angry

521
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,920
that they left without eating.

522
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,240
Is that all my fault?

523
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,320
Doesn't that Big Madam Qin

524
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,720
have any fault at all?

525
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,080
Of course!

526
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,480
How come everything you said were about me?

527
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,960
Is my husband

528
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,960
a perfect person?

529
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,800
Will you be happy

530
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,400
if you two

531
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,000
get criticized together?

532
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,440
It's all him

533
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,800
who dragged me into this muddled water.

534
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:58,840
It shouldn't

535
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,080
only be me who gets talked on, right?

536
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,880
The criticisms about your husband

537
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,400
are still those same words.

538
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,500
Things like being disobedient

539
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,160
since he was a child,

540
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,800
a frequenter of brothels,

541
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,375
the god of death

542
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:08,520
in front of a mountain of corpses.

543
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,760
Those are nothing.

544
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,240
Aren't there anything else?

545
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,600
This Yunhui General of yours

546
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,680
saved the previous emperor

547
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,840
and the current emperor.

548
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,160
Two imperial decrees have said that

549
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,050
he is loyal to the emperor,

550
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:21,840
considerate to the empire,

551
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,360
virtuous, filial, lofty, and unsullied.

552
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,880
Who dares to say more?

553
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,640
He indeed got himself

554
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,520
a protective armor.

555
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,600
This is already great for him.

556
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,560
Otherwise I really don't know

557
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,560
what else those people could say.

558
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,680
I was never invited

559
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,120
to that banquet.

560
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,360
I've never been this coldly treated

561
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,840
even when I was just a Miss in our house.

562
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,080
The ways of your mother-in-law

563
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,360
is way better than those in our house.

564
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,000
No wonder grandmother initially

565
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,480
wouldn't agree to marry you to here.

566
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,875
It was clearly her

567
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,795
who spread the news.

568
00:21:54,425 --> 00:21:55,385
She then had to put out

569
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,360
a being bullied facade.

570
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,040
My husband and I

571
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,575
can't really explain

572
00:21:58,575 --> 00:21:59,480
that to each and every person, right?

573
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,880
Even if we do, no one will believe us.

574
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,800
Sixth,

575
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,000
this isn't good.

576
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,240
Since I took this path,

577
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,200
there's no use to complain no matter how I hated it.

578
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,800
I can't really stop walking it, right?

579
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,840
Even if I don't want to walk,

580
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,080
someone will push me to walk.

581
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,880
Since that's the case,

582
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,440
why not just walk with smile?

583
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,880
I have to live my life in either way.

584
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,520
The task of purchasing for the kitchen

585
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,520
is not a job that one can be sloppy at.

586
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,800
Nanny Lai,

587
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,560
you are

588
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,120
a well-experienced servant.

589
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,520
You also are doing this back

590
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,520
in the marquis manor.

591
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,040
I'll entrust you this task then.

592
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,240
I surely will do my best!

593
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,360
Nanny Diao, you are sickly,

594
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,960
so I won't give you any more task.

595
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,520
Nanny Hua and Nanny Tian

596
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,640
used to be in-charge of clothes washing

597
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,250
and cleaning of the manor

598
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:03,880
back in the marquis manor.

599
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,840
We'll do the same here.

600
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,000
Since you are well-experienced in these tasks,

601
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,200
I'm at ease to hand them to you.

602
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,560
Yes. Yes.

603
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,640
I've already written

604
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,520
what job everyone else will be doing.

605
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,480
Cuiwei will be reading them to you later.

606
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,440
And then, everyone,

607
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,080
just follow the tasks you were given

608
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,640
to get your badge and keys.

609
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,440
I'm young,

610
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,120
so my arrangements may not be that adequate.

611
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,000
Let's just test it for a year.

612
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,400
If you really can't do it

613
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,080
or if there are any improper assignments,

614
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,640
just exchange your work

615
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,240
or come to tell me about it.

616
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,240
Yes.

617
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,800
I woke early today

618
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,720
and feel a bit tired.

619
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,080
I'll go back and rest now.

620
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,160
You all just go do your work.

621
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,400
Okay. Okay.

622
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,320
Let's go. Go.

623
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,680
See that?

624
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,320
She's still indeed young.

625
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,520
After being imposing for three days,

626
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,520
she still couldn't continue with it.

627
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,880
So ingenuous.

628
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,880
She only know to eat and sleep.

629
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,280
Easy to deal with.

630
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,600
Aren't you quite happy?

631
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,840
Go. Go. Let's go get our keys.

632
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,080
Go now.

633
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,280
The rain is dropping

634
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,720
as if the sky is falling.

635
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,200
You were right to told people

636
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:37,920
to take the clothes inside this afternoon.

637
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,400
You indeed can predict things well.

638
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,560
I feel that

639
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,880
what you said is very right.

640
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,120
Wrong.

641
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,080
You should say that I've lectured you well.

642
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,240
It's all thanks to Big Madam for teaching me well.

643
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,280
It's all because you have incredible foresight.

644
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,720
Correct.

645
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,520
I feel that

646
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,960
what you said is very right.

647
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,880
Did you predict then

648
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,480
that your husband will get drenched in the rain?

649
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,800
enter the room, quickly.

650
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,640
I've predicted that it would rain

651
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,720
and told someone to deliver you an umbrella.

652
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,680
How come...

653
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,025
I rode a horse

654
00:25:55,025 --> 00:25:56,720
to attend the imperial court meeting.

655
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,225
It would be better

656
00:25:58,225 --> 00:25:59,480
if you have just given me a veiled hat.

657
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,920
Why don't you...

658
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,760
just ride a carriage to the palace next time?

659
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,960
Next time, I'll ride a carriage to pick you up.

660
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,800
I surely won't let you get wet.

661
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,840
Am I angry about that?!

662
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,320
What then?

663
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,880
Forget it.

664
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,520
I'll just patiently wait.

665
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,280
Wait for what?

666
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,600
Wait until you know

667
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,120
how to treat your husband during a rainy day.

668
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,160
A horse carriage still won't be enough?

669
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,000
Is it because you recently heard

670
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,280
the public talk about us,

671
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,440
that's why you're a bit upset?

672
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,325
During the birthday of the wife

673
00:27:01,325 --> 00:27:02,160
of Duke Ying of the State,

674
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,750
she invited all illustrious families

675
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,320
in the capital,

676
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,560
except us.

677
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,400
She not only didn't invite us,

678
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,760
other than his son-in-law State Uncle Shen,

679
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,080
Little Duan, Old Geng,

680
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,520
and all the others from Yuzhou

681
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,440
were not invited too.

682
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,040
You're just sat there and watched?

683
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,000
He's an old official

684
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,200
that has served three emperors.

685
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,325
Duke Ying of the state and his wife

686
00:27:23,325 --> 00:27:24,360
have very strong personalities,

687
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,250
are very strict in managing their household,

688
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,120
and give too much importance to etiquette.

689
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,040
Before,

690
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,280
I had a very bad reputation

691
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,360
and is now just a newly favored officer.

692
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,400
An old man like that

693
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,560
will never give me any importance.

694
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,650
I'm just afraid that three people

695
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:38,560
can turn a gossip into a tiger.

696
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,760
That the more people doing it can destroy a bone.

697
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,880
No matter how heroic and valiant you are,

698
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,840
if the whole world say that

699
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,840
you are a scoundrel,

700
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,160
as days go by,

701
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,640
the whole world will start to believe it.

702
00:27:48,275 --> 00:27:49,040
Didn't you

703
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,000
exactly suffer because of such trick before?

704
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,240
I'm a scoundrel.

705
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,080
my Wife is seeking justice for me?

706
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,240
As a married couple, we are in the same shoes.

707
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,175
Either one getting glory

708
00:28:02,175 --> 00:28:03,360
or destruction will affect both.

709
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,360
Of course, I must think for your sake.

710
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,160
No need.

711
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:08,775
I've survived

712
00:28:08,775 --> 00:28:10,240
a mountain of blades and a sea of fire.

713
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,680
Would I still mind these things?

714
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,960
Are you mad again?

715
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,720
You can't run away anyways.

716
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,640
The days are long.

717
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,600
It's broad daylight!

718
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,280
Let's eat together later for dinner.

719
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,240
Dinner later!

720
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,400
He's such a ruffian.

721
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,160
So moody.

722
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,160
You can't run away anyway.

723
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,760
then he suddenly

724
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,000
got mad next second.

725
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:55,960
Even Buddha

726
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,080
isn't this hard to attend to.

727
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,040
Have you ironed the clothes?

728
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,200
Who do you think you are?

729
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,840
The salt i have eaten is far more

730
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,520
than the rice you've eaten!

731
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,080
Is it your turn to meddle in this matter?

732
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,320
You are using your age to take advantage of us,

733
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,200
assigning good tasks to your relatives

734
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,240
and earning kickbacks from it.

735
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,800
And you won't even let people talk?

736
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,440
Don't think about that

737
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,560
we don't know about it!

738
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,720
Since that's the case,

739
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,120
go report me then.

740
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:22,960
Go!

741
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,800
The courtyard of Big Madam is just that way,

742
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,160
as if you did not know the direction.

743
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,080
Go and report on me! Go!

744
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,000
Isn't it because you know

745
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,440
that Big Madam has a good temper,

746
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,000
and that you're from the marquis manor,

747
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,440
so no one can touch you, right?

748
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,360
But don't bully people so intolerably!

749
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,960
These two maidservants

750
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,920
are young and inexperienced.

751
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,400
When things have gone missing,

752
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,920
you just blame it on them.

753
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,280
You're already this old，

754
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,680
yet you still bully a child!

755
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,800
Do you have an conscience?

756
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,840
These two little kids

757
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,000
clearly steal something.

758
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,920
yet you are still defending them?

759
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,560
You must be their accomplice.

760
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,120
You...

761
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,550
If I've taken any money improperly

762
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,200
from this manor,

763
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,240
I would then have a tragic death.

764
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,560
There's no use for you to make oaths here.

765
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,720
Let me tell you that

766
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,120
the kitchen purchasing is under my jurisdiction.

767
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,600
I'm also in charge of the items there.

768
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,480
I can investigate whoever I want.

769
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,960
It's none of your business.

770
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,475
You...

771
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,275
What?

772
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,880
You stinky woman!

773
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,680
You bitch!

774
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,080
Say it again!

775
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,720
So what?!

776
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,720
Each of you are...

777
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,760
The Nanny Lai

778
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,040
was still pretentious

779
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,320
in being so just.

780
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,760
Seeing how everyone

781
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,040
can't dare turn hostile against her,

782
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,400
she started to be imposing.

783
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,600
My guess was right.

784
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,360
No matter how sly a fox is,

785
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,640
it will show its tail sooner or later.

786
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,760
The one fighting with her earlier

787
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,800
is the wife of Wang Wu, right?

788
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,400
In the whole Cheng Garden now,

789
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,360
only she

790
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,960
can dare to argue with Nanny Lai.

791
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,640
She's also a very straightforward person.

792
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,920
Big Madam,

793
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,360
you have to intervene.

794
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,480
If you still don't, that straightforward person

795
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,200
will soon get pushed aside

796
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,440
and don't know what to do.

797
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,560
I'm intervening

798
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,000
but not now.

799
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,680
After lunch,

800
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,000
tell that Wang Wu...

801
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,920
Tell that Wang Wu's wife to come to me.

802
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,920
What task do you do?

803
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,520
Replying to Big Madam,

804
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,080
just some manual labor.

805
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,320
Once I'm not doing anything anymore,

806
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,440
I'll go help the gardeners water the flowers

807
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,520
and plow the soil.

808
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,760
I can attend the plants in the garden

809
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,880
to grow quite well.

810
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,200
It was also very clean.

811
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,480
You are really capable.

812
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,680
I'm a crude person and is very straightforward.

813
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,375
I only know to do tasks

814
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:57,200
that requires manual strength,

815
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,600
so I can't be described as being capable.

816
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,240
The eastern side of the garden is quite barren,

817
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,360
hence, not pleasing to the eyes.

818
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,160
I feel that we are lack of someone

819
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,080
who can plant.

820
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,800
I can see that you are knowledgeable in this

821
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,720
and is quite an honest person.

822
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,320
I'll leave this matter to you then.

823
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,600
Big Madam,

824
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,560
are you serious?

825
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,920
Of course I am.

826
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,960
What? You're not willing?

827
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,320
No. No.

828
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,920
It's just that planting

829
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,120
will require a lot of expenses.

830
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,600
I only know to do the manual labor

831
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,520
and has never did such an important task.

832
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,360
I'm afraid that I might not do it well.

833
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,960
You haven't done it,

834
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,120
so how do you know that you can't do it well?

835
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,240
I fear that I don't know the market.

836
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,825
If I buy too expensive ones,

837
00:32:43,825 --> 00:32:45,040
that's additional expenses.

838
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,000
If I buy poor quality ones,

839
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,960
I will cause our manor to lose face.

840
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,300
As long as you set your thoughts

841
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:49,960
in an upright manner,

842
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:50,525
it's fine even if

843
00:32:50,525 --> 00:32:51,360
you aren't able to do this task well.

844
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,560
Whoever dares

845
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,520
to criticize you

846
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,520
and not listen to your orders

847
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,840
will not be spared by me.

848
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,960
Since Big Madam is willing to trust me,

849
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,920
I'll surely give it my best

850
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,520
to complete this task perfectly!

851
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,520
As long as you remember two things.

852
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:06,840
First,

853
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,160
do this task well

854
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,960
and don't let anyone find any flaws.

855
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,720
Second,

856
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,360
Nanny Lai is a well-experienced servant

857
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,280
of the marquis manor.

858
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,400
She has such good temper

859
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,280
and is very amicable.

860
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,080
You must respect her.

861
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,760
Of course, Nanny Lai must be respected.

862
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,560
I understand. I understand everything.

863
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,800
Okay. You can go now.

864
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,120
Yes.

865
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,120
Miss,

866
00:33:59,360 --> 00:33:59,960
did you deliberately

867
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,360
let everyone outside hear that?

868
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,800
Wang Wu's wife had a fight

869
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,480
with Nanny Lai this morning.

870
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,600
This afternoon,

871
00:34:08,606 --> 00:34:10,160
I immediately granted her a good task.

872
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,400
Everyone can surely guess

873
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,800
where the wind is blowing, right?

874
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,120
Hoping that

875
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,120
she can understand what you mean.

876
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,800
Big Madam, father said

877
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,280
that it's fine if you can't write well.

878
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,640
You just need to practice more.

879
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,280
Who said that I can't write well?

880
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,200
I just wrote it in a wrong order just now.

881
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,520
You didn't.

882
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,240
I saw it.

883
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,200
Good child,

884
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,520
let's just continue writing tomorrow.

885
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,000
Let's just read some books for a while.

886
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,160
I've already finished reading that book.

887
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,800
I can recite all of it.

888
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,520
You... at such a young age,

889
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,880
how come you know so many words?

890
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,080
You also know to read poems?

891
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,040
When I used to live on the boat,

892
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,280
my father let me

893
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,600
memorize a poem every day.

894
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,640
Later on,

895
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,080
I went to Second Aunt-in-law's home academy.

896
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,880
Who is Second Aunt-in-law?

897
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,600
The second aunt-in-law of Sheng Family,

898
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,760
Aunt Hai.

899
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,400
You don't even know that?

900
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,560
My brother and sister-in-law

901
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,360
left me with no gap.

902
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,040
They've taught you everything

903
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,320
and I've got nothing left to teach you.

904
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,800
Big Madam, I want to play polo.

905
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,200
I can teach you that!

906
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,880
But, but not now

907
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,920
since you're still young.

908
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,240
You can't ride the horse.

909
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,520
Let's wait a couple more years

910
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,600
and I'll surely teach you.

911
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,920
We can learn how to fish.

912
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,400
We can ride a pony first.

913
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,760
Look at you!

914
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,920
Looks like you've made up your mind already.

915
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,880
Fine. I'll have your father

916
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,080
buy you a small horse then.

917
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,280
We learn how to fish first though.

918
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,280
You can learn that, right?

919
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,200
Yes, I will hook a carp

920
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,120
and make chopped fish.

921
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,800
Take it slow, Nanny Chang.

922
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,880
Big Madam.

923
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,240
Big Madam.

924
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,200
The miss and you are so fated.

925
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,840
Our Miss Rong

926
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,600
still lacks skills of lady's crafts.

927
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,040
We have to coax her three days to embroider once.

928
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:00,920
She holds a needle

929
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,080
and says she's sleepy just at one-incense time.

930
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,080
She's not as steady

931
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,960
as Miss Xian next door.

932
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,400
It's alright.

933
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,120
When she's older,

934
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,200
she'll be more steady.

935
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,600
When I was little,

936
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,680
I was much more playful than her.

937
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,520
Just that

938
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,120
my house wasn't peaceful enough,

939
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,320
so I forced myself to be more rule-bound.

940
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:21,400
But look how great now.

941
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,550
This whole room

942
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,430
lives all our own people,

943
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,720
and she can fuss she wants.

944
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,760
She keeps playing with Sister Xian

945
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,840
and she'll pick it up.

946
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,320
My sister-in-law Shao next door is so amiable too.

947
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,080
Our adults' matters

948
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,400
aren't the kids' issues.

949
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,960
Actually,

950
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,320
Miss Rong is lucky.

951
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,480
My young master is

952
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,040
always worried about Chang.

953
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,320
Big Madam, i mean no offence.

954
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,440
That's his only problem.

955
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,240
Why would I be offended?

956
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,360
This is how a father

957
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,440
should behave.

958
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,960
If I could have had a father like him

959
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,200
when I was young,

960
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,880
many sufferings would have been spared.

961
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,240
Thank you, Big Madam.

962
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,240
My young master is so lucky

963
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,160
that he married you.

964
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,120
I also hope one day

965
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,800
he can find Chang.

966
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,640
And our courtyard will be

967
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,880
that much more bustling.

968
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,160
Who said I stole something?

969
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,160
I thought

970
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,120
these were just useless branches.

971
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,440
So I was cleaning them up

972
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,960
to throw them away outside.

973
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,280
You are always bluffing about

974
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,200
you're an experienced worker from the marquis manor.

975
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,160
That you've managed everything before

976
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,480
and you know it all.

977
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,640
But you can't even recognize tree roots?

978
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,960
You're trying to fool us as if we're idiots?

979
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,925
This is a noble specie transported

980
00:38:41,925 --> 00:38:42,680
from Jiangnan.

981
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,680
Each stem costs a strand of money.

982
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,480
You're trying to take it to sell it outside!

983
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,640
Did you see me stealing

984
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,880
with your own eyes?

985
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,080
Let me tell you.

986
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,000
Even if you report to the big madam,

987
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,160
I won't acknowledge it.

988
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,560
You think you are really something

989
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,520
before Big Madam?

990
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,360
She's from a noble house

991
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,240
and she doesn't care.

992
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,400
But you!

993
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,960
You think you're so mighty!

994
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,480
Nanny Lai,

995
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,720
there's God on top of your head.

996
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,360
Stop committing so many evil deeds

997
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,080
or karma will hit you.

998
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,840
You! You!

999
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,280
Fine. Fine.

1000
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,360
Stop.

1001
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,560
Don't stop me.

1002
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,520
I must teach

1003
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,800
this whore.

1004
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,320
Stop pulling me.

1005
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,320
You'll all get reprimanded.

1006
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,560
What are you!

1007
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,200
I'm at least from the marquis house.

1008
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,640
You? What can you do to me?

1009
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,120
You're from the marquis house.

1010
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,480
And you instigated

1011
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,240
your second daughter to go

1012
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,320
and seduce our Master.

1013
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,160
Who can't see that through?

1014
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,720
If our Madam finds out,

1015
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,400
you'll be the first to be expelled out.

1016
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,160
I'll kill you.

1017
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,600
You know?

1018
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,560
We're onto you.

1019
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,960
You still think you're so mighty?

1020
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,400
Stop pulling me.

1021
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,920
Forget it.

1022
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:56,800
They're fighting! They're fighting!

1023
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,120
They're fighting!

1024
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,480
Then you don't go out

1025
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,160
so you don't get hurt.

1026
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,200
I won't.

1027
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,960
They won't dare to hurt me.

1028
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,800
That.

1029
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,080
That child.

1030
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,960
She's like her father. Just too bold.

1031
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,880
Forgive me, Big Madam.

1032
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,160
It's not I that wanted to be meddlesome.

1033
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:18,800
But nowadays,

1034
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,080
in this marquis manor,

1035
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,200
it's always someone

1036
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,160
fighting here or there.

1037
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,720
It's ridiculously chaotic.

1038
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,920
Allow me to speak an usurping word.

1039
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,120
Back then,

1040
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,240
in the inner courtyard of the Bai House in Yangzhou,

1041
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,280
even they were more rule-bound.

1042
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,760
The Bai House lord

1043
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,400
must have set a strict manner.

1044
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,880
Of course.

1045
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,640
Such a large manor

1046
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,960
can't be without rules.

1047
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:47,680
Back then

1048
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,160
when Ye's maternal grandmother was alive,

1049
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,280
the servants

1050
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,280
didn't even dare to talk in a loud voice.

1051
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,760
Later, unfortunately she passed away,

1052
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,760
and my miss took over things.

1053
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,680
She set up iron rules herself.

1054
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,280
If someone commits a grave wrong,

1055
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,080
they are severely punished

1056
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,080
without any mercy.

1057
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,520
It's true.

1058
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,350
In order to punish

1059
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,240
those petty troublemakers severely,

1060
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,760
I must wait till they commit a grave wrong first.

1061
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,120
Big Madam, I don't understand.

1062
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,520
If it's our own servants,

1063
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,800
we can handle however we want

1064
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,160
if they are wrong.

1065
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,120
But these are all

1066
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,400
sent over by the elders from the marquis manor.

1067
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,480
If they have some fights.

1068
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,320
We can give them a couple rebukes today

1069
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,880
and two slashes tomorrow.

1070
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,360
Day after day,

1071
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,240
and they'll know

1072
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,680
it's not such a big deal.

1073
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,600
Now,

1074
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,520
Nanny Lai gains no trusts from other people,

1075
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,080
but without Nanny Lai,

1076
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,280
there are still Nanny Hua and Nanny Tian.

1077
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,960
When will it end?

1078
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:44,875
It's better to hit them dead

1079
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:45,440
with a cane

1080
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,680
making her not dare to do it again.

1081
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,480
Big Madam. If there's anything,

1082
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,160
Perhaps I can help with?

1083
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,080
There is a matter that

1084
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,920
I really do need your help.

1085
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,280
Great.

1086
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,280
I hear that illegitimate daughter of Sheng House,

1087
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,640
as soon as she married,

1088
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,840
she just drove Gu to move out.

1089
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,320
She even scolds an elderly nanny

1090
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,200
who's been there over a decade.

1091
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,360
That Second Gu

1092
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,720
is a rogue as well.

1093
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,840
He always goes out,

1094
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,240
fetching all sorts of novelties for her to eat.

1095
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,560
A general

1096
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,000
is being dispatched like a junior servant.

1097
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,480
What a shame.

1098
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,720
Old Marquis's corpse is still not cold yet.

1099
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,840
And that Second Gu already

1100
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,680
left the capital to pursue freedom.

1101
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,480
I don't know what luck he's got though.

1102
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,040
Somehow he's managed himself into a new noble.

1103
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,700
He's made it and turned over

1104
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,720
to give the cold shoulder.

1105
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,720
And mock the Gu elders like this.

1106
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,880
I think

1107
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,680
he and that one from Sheng House

1108
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,560
are perfect matches.

1109
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,320
I don't know what spells she put on Yuanruo

1110
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,360
to make him love her so much.

1111
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,680
Thanks God that

1112
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,040
they didn't marry.

1113
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,600
Otherwise, who knows how

1114
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,360
our family would be.

1115
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,800
Why do you get up?

1116
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,400
You've been ill for so long

1117
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,480
and you're just recovered.

1118
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,600
Don't get catch a cold again.

1119
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,920
Sixth Sister only loves eating a little bit.

1120
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,200
I think Second Gu doting on her,

1121
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,920
no big deal.

1122
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,800
Not even worth to mention.

1123
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,840
Her temperament

1124
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,840
is most prudent and diligent.

1125
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,575
She's not someone to

1126
00:43:38,575 --> 00:43:39,520
go wild when gaining of power.

1127
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,840
People are just too talkative

1128
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,920
and I think it's just some fake gossips.

1129
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:43,680
Yes.

1130
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,960
We don't mention her then.

1131
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:48,440
I came

1132
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,760
to report to Father and Mother.

1133
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,120
My body is fine now.

1134
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,480
I was ill before

1135
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,800
and it delayed my reporting to duty.

1136
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,800
Starting tomorrow, I will head on over.

1137
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,840
I'm glad you've thought it through.

1138
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,400
We all need to

1139
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,880
look ahead to our future life.

1140
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,000
Yuanruo, Yuanruo,

1141
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,400
do you want to...

1142
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,680
Don't mention it again.

1143
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,240
Then we never say it?

1144
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,240
We'll mention it in a couple years.

1145
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:29,800
Father.

1146
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,040
Do you want to find me a wife?

1147
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,560
Since you're not that young anymore.

1148
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,520
And you've passed the exam and that Shen Family...

1149
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,560
You're still young so there is no need to rush.

1150
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,280
We'll talk about it a couple years later.

1151
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,880
Just focus on your official career.

1152
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,275
If Father and Mother

1153
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,315
think it's necessary,

1154
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,640
then please proceed.
