00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,525
The Story of Minglan

2
00:00:59,525 --> 00:01:02,050
Episode 36

3
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,520
Mother! Mother!

4
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,400
Mother!

5
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,480
Quite！

6
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:17,720
Father.

7
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,560
Your mother doesn't want

8
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,560
people shouting.

9
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:24,480
What is it that's making you so happy?

10
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,421
Upon ascension to the throne,

11
00:01:25,421 --> 00:01:26,150
the new Emperor granted graces

12
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:26,960
regarding the imperial examination.

13
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:27,850
I can already take it again

14
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:28,440
at the start of spring

15
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,960
and not wait for one more year.

16
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,280
Great!

17
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,334
Mother

18
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:51,825
If I'm able to

19
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,480
pass the coming imperial examination,

20
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,440
hope Mother can be merciful and go

21
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,080
request marriage to the Sheng Family.

22
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,720
You can have what you want.

23
00:02:06,343 --> 00:02:07,320
I will do whatever you want.

24
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,200
Mother still hasn't recovered.

25
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,840
Don't force her anymore.

26
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,280
That day in the Imperial palace

27
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,280
your mother relied on pretending to be crazy

28
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,440
to escape that disaster.

29
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,840
Afterwards, the men of Prince Yan

30
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,675
tossed her onto

31
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,840
the main street of Bianjing.

32
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,240
So many people were watching.

33
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,280
She's a competitive person.

34
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,880
With such huge shame,

35
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,200
we should already be thankful to the gods

36
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,000
that she didn't really go crazy.

37
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,680
Father

38
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,080
My marriage matters...

39
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,760
You can do it as you wish.

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,520
If we just followed your will long ago

41
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,680
and proposed marriage to the Sheng Family,

42
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,960
all these things after

43
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,240
wouldn't have happened.

44
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,600
Open the door!

45
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,720
Who is it?

46
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,280
Open the door!

47
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,520
Who is it!

48
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,640
Shitou.

49
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,960
Marquis!

50
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,560
Young Master, please enter.

51
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,160
Dear Second Son!

52
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,360
Dear Second!

53
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,000
I have disappointed you, Big Madam Qin .

54
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,160
I've returned well,

55
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,480
better than before.

56
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,520
Because you ran away,

57
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,440
you'd scared all of us.

58
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,440
We don't know what sufferings

59
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,720
you've encountered outside,

60
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,880
and how many hardships you had to endure.

61
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,640
Look at

62
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,200
how thin you are.

63
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,000
Big Madam,

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,720
stop being pretentious here.

65
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,760
Even I feel ashamed just by seeing it.

66
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,920
Eldest Brother!

67
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,720
Eldest Brother is here.

68
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,320
Long time no see.

69
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,160
Don't you want

70
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,320
to say a few words to me?

71
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,750
From Prince Yan forcing the Emperor to abdicate,

72
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,640
to the rebel army getting pacified,

73
00:05:31,975 --> 00:05:34,680
up to the new Emperor ascending to the throne,

74
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,200
half a month has already passed.

75
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,800
You never

76
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,000
leaked any news

77
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,120
to let us know

78
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,586
that not only are you back,

79
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,000
you even are promoted

80
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,560
to the head of the Imperial Guards,

81
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,160
only to

82
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,800
come here today by surprise

83
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,640
and brag in front of us.

84
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,360
It was clearly you people

85
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,400
who shut your gates and cowered,

86
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,080
didn't want to hear what's happening outside,

87
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,600
and didn't want to join any power struggle,

88
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,960
yet you are saying

89
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,560
that I schemed and did a despicable thing.

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,950
So the ability

91
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,240
of Eldest Brother

92
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,880
to frame me

93
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,680
not only didn't regress,

94
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,680
it has improved to a whole new level!

95
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,680
Dear Second!

96
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,920
Stop joking!

97
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,900
It's not easy to be back.

98
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,760
Then don't go away again.

99
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,200
We'll set up

100
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,960
a welcoming banquet for you tonight.

101
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,200
Hurry up! Servant!

102
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,760
Quickly get your Third Young Master for me!

103
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,640
Also, call the Fourth and Fifth Houses

104
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,480
for a reunion meal!

105
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,360
Yes.

106
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,440
No need for such trouble.

107
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,160
You won't be able to find Third Brother.

108
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,800
Don't you know?

109
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,600
Last night,

110
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,325
there was a group of rich young lads

111
00:06:53,325 --> 00:06:53,840
in Qianchun Brothel

112
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,080
that got arrested.

113
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,320
It's a period of state mourning.

114
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,480
Big Madam,

115
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,960
Third brother was among them.

116
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,880
Didn't you know that

117
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,920
Third Brother crept out last night

118
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,520
to have drinks in a brothel?

119
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,240
Drinking during the state mourning period.

120
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,680
That's a grave crime!

121
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,200
Can you rescue

122
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
Third brother from this?

123
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,575
Disobeying the system of rites

124
00:07:24,575 --> 00:07:25,480
during state mourning.

125
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,720
You tell me.

126
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,800
Why then did you come here

127
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,640
to tell us this?

128
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,480
To deliberately laugh at us?

129
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,800
Laugh at the House of Gu?

130
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,480
Are you that without guilt?

131
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,760
Then back when Father had just died,

132
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,840
weren't you all

133
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,600
so guilt-free too when you

134
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,400
became so pretentious

135
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,400
and started spouting those lies!

136
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,440
But

137
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,360
Third Brother.

138
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,440
Third Little Brother

139
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,280
was always loyal to you.

140
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,360
Mother, what about you?

141
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,300
You saw me grow up.

142
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,920
Spoiled and doted on me.

143
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,850
That was intending for me to fail

144
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:19,520
by giving me praises!

145
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,325
You just wanted to

146
00:08:21,325 --> 00:08:22,600
get me driven out of the House of Gu.

147
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,960
You made a wishful thinking.

148
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,600
You wanted Third Brother to

149
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,560
succeed the Marquis position.

150
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,240
You could have just told me!

151
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,380
If you said that, I would have yielded!

152
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,880
But you didn't.

153
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,800
You want a united and harmonious family,

154
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,272
so that he succeeds to the noble title

155
00:08:41,272 --> 00:08:42,245
in a pleasant manner.

156
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,920
However, I insist on not letting you have it.

157
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,680
I came here today

158
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,000
just to tell you

159
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,750
that I also want to inherit

160
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,680
our family's noble title!

161
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,080
Then are you

162
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,000
disobeying the proper rites?

163
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,880
Are you treating me, your Eldest Brother,

164
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,880
as if dead?

165
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,120
Eldest Brother,

166
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,680
I respected and loved you before

167
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,720
or else

168
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,080
I wouldn't have recited to you

169
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,040
the poems of Master Wuduan.

170
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,560
But you instead harmed me!

171
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,520
You didn't even let me

172
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,625
see Father's last moments!

173
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,120
You had the whole Gu family berate me.

174
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,360
You still want me

175
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,360
to acknowledge you as my eldest brother?

176
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,880
No way.

177
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,120
You came today

178
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,560
just to insult us!

179
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,480
If you haven't finished

180
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,720
why don't you continue in the main receiving hall?

181
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:52,840
Don't taint

182
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,520
the ears of our ancestors here

183
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,960
and disturb their peace.

184
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,790
Eldest Brother, you said it right.

185
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,040
Let's not disturb

186
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,520
our ancestors' peace here.

187
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,600
I'm just going to take an item

188
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,720
and will immediately leave.

189
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:11,920
What item?

190
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,240
That was bestowed by the Emperor.

191
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,600
How can you be allowed to take it away?

192
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,120
That was bestowed to me.

193
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,720
Why can't I take it away?

194
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,840
What if I don't give it to you?

195
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,240
Husband.

196
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,275
You dare to use violence

197
00:10:46,275 --> 00:10:47,200
inside our ancestral hall!

198
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,320
On the battlefield, within that bloodbath,

199
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,880
what bastards haven't I seen?

200
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,600
What people haven't I killed?

201
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,080
Okay.

202
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,600
Husband!

203
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,240
Eldest son!

204
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,320
Shitou.

205
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,320
Second son!

206
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,200
If...

207
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,840
if you want it,

208
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,863
just take it.

209
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,680
Mother!

210
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,440
Eldest son,

211
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,360
we can't allow violence here

212
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,880
inside the ancestral hall.

213
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,240
But...

214
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,280
When I wanted to take it before,

215
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,520
you wouldn't allow it.

216
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,320
You drove me out

217
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,280
like some thief.

218
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,000
I told you

219
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,640
that one day,

220
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,520
I surely will make you offer it

221
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,880
to me with two hands.

222
00:12:09,685 --> 00:12:11,395
Today, I'm going to fulfill those words.

223
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,760
Will it be Mother handing it

224
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,320
to me with both hands,

225
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,640
or Eldest Brother?

226
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,600
You.

227
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,068
Eldest son!

228
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,520
Mother is an elder.

229
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,400
I feel that

230
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,800
I should trouble dear old Eldest Brother instead.

231
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,960
Eldest son!

232
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,520
Eldest son!

233
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,200
Eldest son,

234
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,800
You are the pillar of the house,

235
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,320
and a descendant of the Marquis House.

236
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,100
It's better to just let me.

237
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,640
Mother.

238
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,600
Let me do it.

239
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,520
Second son,

240
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,920
take it.

241
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,360
With your acting being this good,

242
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,600
it's really such a pity

243
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,200
that you don't go around singing southern operas!

244
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,320
How about we just do as you wish?

245
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,520
I'll stay behind and have a reunion meal!

246
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,320
Let's go!

247
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,320
This,

248
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,680
this mansion of yours.

249
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,560
It's really not bad.

250
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,400
This is near the Marquis Manor,

251
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,480
just one street's far.

252
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,225
At least someone will be able to

253
00:15:19,225 --> 00:15:19,800
take care of you in the future.

254
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,160
Take care?

255
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,520
His Majesty

256
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,680
knows all of these.

257
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:26,840
He wants me to reconcile

258
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,240
with the House of Gu.

259
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,520
You know that,

260
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,650
yet you still made that ruckus

261
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:32,480
in the Marquis Manor.

262
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,920
As soon as you had come out of the Marquis Manor,

263
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,000
the whole capital

264
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,840
already knew about it.

265
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,150
So what？

266
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,120
That Big Madam in our house

267
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,080
so wants to beat on the drums

268
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,000
and let everyone know!

269
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,360
You now are famous.

270
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,440
You should be a good model

271
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,680
to the younger generations.

272
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,720
The whole capital is watching.

273
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,760
You must be cautious.

274
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,160
I've long been

275
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,360
an infamous person

276
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,120
here in the capital.

277
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,480
You won't be able to change that.

278
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,775
A few days ago,

279
00:16:12,775 --> 00:16:13,840
a message came from the southern borders.

280
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,640
It seems that trouble has occurred down there.

281
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,520
His Majesty asked me to lead an army

282
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,680
to join General Gan

283
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,560
in fighting the war over there.

284
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,480
Once I leave, the talk will stop.

285
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,200
Be careful.

286
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,800
Okay.

287
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,760
I was still thinking

288
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,406
to ask you to

289
00:16:34,406 --> 00:16:36,390
try the spring examination once more.

290
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,160
With me being like this now,

291
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,080
why still take the test?

292
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,500
I'm not taking it again.

293
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,280
You are full of talent.

294
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,920
I feel sorry for you.

295
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,000
Zecheng, you have it wrong.

296
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,280
Now, when the flames of war are ignited,

297
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,160
the ones who suffer the most are the citizens.

298
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,560
They are left with no means of living.

299
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,040
Corpses are piled up like mountains.

300
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,920
Everyone is selling off his children.

301
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,480
Even an asshole like me

302
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,840
has nightmares at night.

303
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,440
Seeing as how I'm capable

304
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,800
to lead an army and fight wars,

305
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,640
it's better to just serve the country.

306
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,440
You have the world in your heart.

307
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,080
I am

308
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:22,960
inferior to you.

309
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,240
You're making me blush.

310
00:17:35,424 --> 00:17:36,480
This way.

311
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,020
Young Master!

312
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,080
Young Master, careful.

313
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,050
What's wrong?

314
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,400
Look.

315
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,560
Earlier, there was a group of people outside again

316
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,600
handling me so many invitations.

317
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,120
All of them want to come here and visit you,

318
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,120
Commander.

319
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,600
I couldn't even drive them away.

320
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,480
Lord Sheng.

321
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,025
It's the state mourning period

322
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,160
and yet they all are coming?

323
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,000
All of them want to marry their daughters to me.

324
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,240
It's still the state mourning period.

325
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,400
These people

326
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,080
don't care about

327
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,000
the state mourning.

328
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,840
A few days ago

329
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,080
on the doorstep of Fan House,

330
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,320
they even blocked my path!

331
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,320
They insisted

332
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,050
they had a marriage alliance with me

333
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:17,840
when I was little!

334
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,360
They even grabbed Rong

335
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,240
and said that they don't mind!

336
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,040
That really scared me!

337
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,280
I hurriedly carried Rong off and left.

338
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,720
I said that I was going to the lavatory.

339
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,160
What?

340
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,920
You didn't like any of them?

341
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,680
Why doesn't your Sheng Family

342
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,800
recommend a daughter

343
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,160
to be my wife?

344
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,440
Dream on!

345
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,640
My mother

346
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,640
has long set her eyes

347
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,080
on the son of my uncle

348
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,080
to be my Fifth Little Sister's husband.

349
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,400
For Sixth Little Sister,

350
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,200
it's of course Grandmother's call.

351
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,625
She seems to have set her eyes

352
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,650
on the youngest son

353
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,840
of the House of He from Baishitan.

354
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,440
The House of He who are doctors by profession?

355
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,450
Have they given any betrothal gifts?

356
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,320
How come I never heard of it?

357
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,200
It's state mourning.

358
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,050
How can they give any betrothal gifts

359
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:11,480
during this period?

360
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,080
But it seems to be more or less settled.

361
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,640
I've also seen him.

362
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,880
That lad from the House of He

363
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,520
is gentle and honest.

364
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,480
Sixth Little Sister

365
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,120
has a good character and taste.

366
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,880
If she gets married off to that family,

367
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,840
she surely will have a fortunate life.

368
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,520
Being fortunate or not

369
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,120
is really hard to say.

370
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,280
Some people may appear to be having a hard life

371
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,040
but they are actually very blessed.

372
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,160
Some people feel that he is very fortunate,

373
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,300
but deep inside,

374
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,000
he has a predicament that he can't talk about.

375
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,800
Can't that mouth of yours

376
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,520
say anything good?

377
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,280
Let's just focus on looking around your house.

378
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,200
Zhonghuai,

379
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,300
the battlefield is a dangerous place.

380
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,560
You must always be careful.

381
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,120
I know.

382
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,400
The only thing that worries me is

383
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,680
that Chang has still not been found.

384
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,875
I've already informed my brothers

385
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:27,440
in the Canal Gang

386
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,400
to search for him in Jiangnan.

387
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,480
Anyway,

388
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,075
if there is any news,

389
00:20:33,075 --> 00:20:34,000
they will send it to the capital.

390
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,200
Help me look out for it.

391
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,040
Your son is my nephew.

392
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,280
I surely will be mindful about it.

393
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,640
Thank you for your trouble, Young Master Sheng.

394
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,680
Young Master Ye, regarding the child,

395
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,280
we'll handle it.

396
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,880
But what about your marriage?

397
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,920
In going to war this time,

398
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,360
don't know

399
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,120
when you'll be back again.

400
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,880
In such a big manor,

401
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,880
there must at least

402
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,840
be a main madam!

403
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,160
Put it in your mind,

404
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,960
okay?

405
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,280
I know!

406
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,320
I don't like any of those families!

407
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,360
Your Master!

408
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,520
Could it be that you already like someone?

409
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,960
Go back! All of you, just go back!

410
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,680
Shitou.

411
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,080
I want to ask you to do something for me.

412
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,880
The battlefield is so dangerous.

413
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,320
How can I leave your side?

414
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,520
I'm only at ease if you're the one

415
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,520
who handles this matter for me.

416
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,760
Miss,

417
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,850
the osmanthus flower harvest this year

418
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:38,320
is really great.

419
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,080
After air-drying, there is still so much left.

420
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,320
They're cleaner than the ones being sold outside!

421
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,360
Really?

422
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,760
Salt-preserve and then fry them.

423
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,840
Xiaotao loves eating most.

424
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,760
Miss,

425
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,320
it's as if you're not eating them.

426
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,680
We feel as if the days are passing by so quickly,

427
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,800
but Miss instead might be feeling

428
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,920
as if the days are years.

429
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,240
So wanting the state mourning to be over,

430
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,280
so the He Family can come and propose marriage.

431
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,040
You girl, you're becoming more and more unruly.

432
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,840
What nonsense are you saying?

433
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:04,840
If anyone hears it,

434
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,320
our Miss will just get laughed at.

435
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,800
This marriage

436
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,560
is already

437
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,360
a sure thing.

438
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,280
Only the betrothal gifts are left to seal it.

439
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,280
Miss, don't be shy.

440
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,840
Indeed.

441
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,520
Look at those mandarin ducks playing in the water

442
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,280
and hundred of butterflies over the flowers.

443
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,640
Her embroidery is all about

444
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,920
a harmonious married couple's life.

445
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:23,625
If I don't embroider that,

446
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:24,160
what should I embroider?

447
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,440
Do you want me

448
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,800
to embroider steamed herring

449
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,480
and rose flaky pastry instead?

450
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,560
You might be happy,

451
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,040
but I'll get beaten out of here!

452
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,280
Greetings, Sixth Miss.

453
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,480
Young Lord He is here.

454
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,075
He's with Old Madam

455
00:23:38,075 --> 00:23:39,200
and waiting for the meal to be served.

456
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,000
Old Madam said that she is tired.

457
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,200
She asked that you go there,

458
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,040
and chat with him a little.

459
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,960
Okay, I got it.

460
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,880
And we were just talking about him.

461
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,800
He is over here.

462
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,680
I don't want to defy the mandate of heaven!

463
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,475
I was delivering medicinal ingredients

464
00:23:59,475 --> 00:24:00,000
outside recently,

465
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,325
and it happened to coincide

466
00:24:01,325 --> 00:24:02,120
with the return of my Uncle Cao

467
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,720
from the borders after being given a pardon.

468
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,720
I had to settle them down and handle some matters.

469
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,840
Hence, I wasn't able to come here for a few days.

470
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,480
Hope Old Madam didn't mind.

471
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,360
Having a good business is a more important matter.

472
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,320
It's also proper to help your relatives out.

473
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,680
Hong, you don't need to blame yourself.

474
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,440
It's not also self-blaming.

475
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,280
I'm just eager to visit you, Old Madam.

476
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,800
Look how honeymouthed this child is.

477
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,746
Indeed.

478
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,920
The weather is slowly getting colder.

479
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,320
Little Sister has to greet Old Madam

480
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,680
in the morning and at night.

481
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,360
You must wear more clothing.

482
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,880
Regarding food, don't be greedy for cold dishes.

483
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,160
You must be

484
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,320
extra careful.

485
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,640
Why don't you just directly say

486
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,040
that I shouldn't be a glutton.

487
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,680
A good appetite is a blessing.

488
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,520
This way, our body can be healthy.

489
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,840
When Mother returned from our hometown this time

490
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,280
she brought so many delicious foods.

491
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,480
I've brought you

492
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,280
and Old Madam some of them.

493
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,840
Your mother is sickly.

494
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,725
She must be worn-out

495
00:25:04,725 --> 00:25:06,400
in travelling to the capital by carriage.

496
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,560
It's really hard on her.

497
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,000
Grandmother said that

498
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,840
in a few days,

499
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,360
there will be a rite that would require

500
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,160
the main madam of the house to attend,

501
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,720
so mother has to come.

502
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,240
Mother's health hasn't gone bad to the point

503
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,320
that she can't move around anymore.

504
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,880
Last month,

505
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,360
when the whole family of Auntie Cao returned,

506
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,400
Mother was so happy

507
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,375
that her health has become better

508
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:33,000
than earlier this year.

509
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,160
Your mother has poor health.

510
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,320
I'm also a sickly person.

511
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,650
As they say, if you're chronically ill,

512
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:40,840
you tend to become a good doctor.

513
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,500
Plus the fact that

514
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,560
I have such a gluttonous granddaughter,

515
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,760
we've come up with

516
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,240
a medicinal dish recipe.

517
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,925
We want to gift it to your mother

518
00:25:47,925 --> 00:25:49,280
to nourish her health.

519
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,520
Your family has been doctors for generations.

520
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,775
We are just displaying our slight skills

521
00:25:54,775 --> 00:25:55,740
before an expert.

522
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,040
You and your grandmother

523
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,875
mustn't laugh at us,

524
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:01,302
okay?

525
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,160
I am only be grateful to Old Madam

526
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,080
and Sixth Miss.

527
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,700
I dare not think too highly of myself.

528
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,900
Sit. Sit down!

529
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,480
This recipe book of medicinal dishes of Sixth Miss

530
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,150
surely will have both

531
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,200
medicinal efficacy and good taste.

532
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,360
I surely must

533
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,491
read this carefully when I go back.

534
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,075
A ruler and his subjects assist each other,

535
00:26:26,475 --> 00:26:27,120
can help each other out.

536
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,575
She might want to leave her name

537
00:26:28,575 --> 00:26:29,400
in the medicinal books.

538
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,800
You're praising our Miss so much.

539
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,160
Can she have better medical skills

540
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:34,960
than you?

541
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,920
She is very talented.

542
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,560
If she can learn more,

543
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,600
she surely can

544
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,680
surpass me.

545
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,320
Young Master, you've walked past your carriage!

546
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,640
Young Master, take care.

547
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,800
Old Madam will be waiting for your next visit.

548
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,680
You two just chat

549
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,760
about the efficacy of that recipe book then.

550
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,720
Sure. I surely will come earlier.

551
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,800
Please go back now.

552
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,200
Seeing Young Master He

553
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,240
is so good with our Miss,

554
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,880
I'm at ease.

555
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,960
Our Miss will surely

556
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,680
have a blessed life in the future.

557
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,120
Whoever marries our Miss

558
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,160
is the one who is fortunate.

559
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,480
Cousin!

560
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,600
Cousin Hongwen!

561
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,240
Cousin!

562
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,040
Who is that?

563
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:24,680
I thought

564
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,300
that I wouldn't ever see you again!

565
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,000
Cousin!

566
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,040
Okay. Okay. Don't cry. Don't cry.

567
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,000
If there's something, let's talk about it at home.

568
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,880
There are so many people going about here.

569
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,600
Get in the carriage first.

570
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,760
I dare not talk to others.

571
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,680
If others hear them,

572
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,120
I can only kill myself!

573
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,880
Get in the carriage first.

574
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,920
Xiaotao!

575
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,080
I heard that

576
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,560
you're getting married, is that right?

577
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,000
Yes.

578
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,200
I heard that

579
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,120
Sixth Miss Sheng is good in every way.

580
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,360
She's docile, friendly,

581
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,160
and has a good family background.

582
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,480
She's even as beautiful as a fairy.

583
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,720
She's indeed a very good lady.

584
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,480
You can say that I've climbed to a higher branch.

585
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Cousin,

586
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,800
my mother said

587
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,120
to ask you to take me in as a concubine.

588
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,920
What did Auntie say?

589
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,440
I-I understand.

590
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:37,920
I'm not worthy

591
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,000
to be a concubine.

592
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,920
I'll just

593
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,400
be a female servant

594
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,440
guarding the gates in your house.

595
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,750
Cousin, if you grant me food to eat

596
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,560
and clothes to wear,

597
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,520
I'm already very grateful.

598
00:28:48,475 --> 00:28:49,450
I just fear that Sixth Miss Sheng

599
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:50,720
might be domineering

600
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,640
and won't accommodate me.

601
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,200
No, no, Sixth Miss

602
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,160
isn't that kind of person.

603
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,960
She's very gracious.

604
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,600
Yes, yes, I said it wrong.

605
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,800
I didn't mean it like that.

606
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,760
Even if she treats me

607
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,640
like a cat, dog,

608
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,480
or some little plaything,

609
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,360
she surely would still be

610
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,480
very amiable to me.

611
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,080
I-I still

612
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,480
have to inform Grandmother

613
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,960
and Old Madam Sheng about this.

614
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,840
Yes, you should.

615
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,240
I'm even willing to work as a horse.

616
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:20,840
Cousin.

617
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,040
Cousin, if you don't take me in,

618
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,120
I can only go die!

619
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,240
No, Cousin, get up first.

620
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,200
Let's talk it over properly.

621
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,880
We have to discuss this matter slowly.

622
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:32,880
Get up.

623
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,480
You must promise me.

624
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,040
Let's go home first, okay?

625
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,040
Minglan.

626
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,120
Why have you come?

627
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,800
Miss Sheng!

628
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,800
Don't blame Cousin!

629
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,480
It is I who was ignorant of proper etiquette

630
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,320
and followed him.

631
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,680
Cousin only thinks of you.

632
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,720
You're the only one in his heart.

633
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,600
As an unmarried lady,

634
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,680
you must be cautious with your words.

635
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,450
Don't be tactless,

636
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,200
so as not to bring trouble

637
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,520
to the people around you.

638
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,080
Get up first to talk.

639
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,000
If other people see this,

640
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,880
they will think that I'm bullying you.

641
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,800
Get up first.

642
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,440
Miss Sheng,

643
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,280
look at me.

644
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,360
I'm inferior than you in every way.

645
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,440
Just pity me, okay?

646
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,675
I'm like a swallow in a snow-covered field,

647
00:30:30,675 --> 00:30:31,700
or a fish in a drying pond.

648
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,800
Please give me a path to survive.

649
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,320
I won't compete with you for anything.

650
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,440
I already look like this.

651
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,360
I won't be able to compete with you about anything.

652
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,520
You what happened to you?

653
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,880
Cousin, don't you know that

654
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,720
prisoners who get exiled must be tattooed.

655
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,400
With this

656
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,840
my whole life is over.

657
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,000
It's fine.

658
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,000
I'll research a medicine for you

659
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,840
when we go back.

660
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,600
I surely will remove it.

661
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,840
Miss Sheng,

662
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,300
you've enjoyed a blessed life

663
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,050
with adequate food and clothes.

664
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,240
I'm just a pitiful person.

665
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,200
What is Brother Hong's opinion about this?

666
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,560
Let's make her

667
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,480
a steward's maidservant

668
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,560
in the outer courtyard.

669
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:45,880
No.

670
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,760
Since we've discussed this matter to this point,

671
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,240
let me be clear.

672
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,760
Miss Cao,

673
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,360
you're not a slave that was bought.

674
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,280
You are Brother Hongwen's cousin

675
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,720
whom he grew up with.

676
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,800
In his heart,

677
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,960
you will always have a place.

678
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,280
If the man I marry doesn't place me

679
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,600
as the priority in his heart,

680
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,960
I'd rather not marry forever.

681
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,440
I won't take in this imperfect relationship.

682
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,600
In my heart,

683
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,800
you are the most important person.

684
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,400
Really?

685
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,840
Is there no way to take care of her

686
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,120
except for taking her as a concubine?

687
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,040
Go look for a good family

688
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,680
to marry her into.

689
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,720
Prepare her a good dowry,

690
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,800
so she can have the support of her in-laws.

691
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,680
Wouldn't all that work too?

692
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,920
Brother Hongwen,

693
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,840
it's not that I'm forcing you.

694
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,400
These past years,

695
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,440
Old Madam He

696
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,920
has helped my family a lot.

697
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,880
You also treated me well.

698
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,880
If you really have feelings

699
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,760
for your cousin,

700
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:49,920
I won't hold any grudge against you.

701
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,120
But to ask me to

702
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:54,920
share a husband with Miss Cao,

703
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,160
I won't agree to it.

704
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,480
You can only choose one of us.

705
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,360
I won't allow her to be your concubine,

706
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,280
a chamber maid, a maidservant,

707
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,000
or a servant doing manual labor.

708
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,320
Okay.

709
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,560
Okay. I surely will

710
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,240
find her a good husband.

711
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,320
Cousin!

712
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,680
Are you asking me to die?

713
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,920
With a face like this,

714
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,280
who can accommodate me for a lifetime?

715
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,475
Who will be willing to marry me

716
00:33:19,475 --> 00:33:21,000
or take me in as a concubine?

717
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,800
Even if I go

718
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,200
become someone else's servant,

719
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,626
I will only be disliked by my master.

720
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,240
I'm not even qualified

721
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,320
to cook in the kitchen.

722
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,640
Cousin,

723
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,440
I can only die.

724
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,320
How could you be so bold?

725
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,160
It can't be that you're afraid you can't marry

726
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,960
and you went to reason with her!

727
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,240
What's your status

728
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,240
and what's Cao House's status?

729
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,000
That Cao Jingxiu!

730
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,200
Not even good enough

731
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,080
to be a fire and water maid.

732
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,880
That Miss Cao is

733
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,160
indeed a pitiful person.

734
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,680
Pitiful person?

735
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,000
She's snatching

736
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,760
your future husband!

737
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,480
If she doesn't marry into the He House,

738
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,000
I should do my all to help her.

739
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,880
I've already done my best.

740
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,840
It's people who propose but God who disposes.

741
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,840
So the rest

742
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,160
we will leave to God.

743
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,760
Since you've made up your mind

744
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,720
it's actually good.

745
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,640
That He House is so ungrateful

746
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,240
to let this happen.

747
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,280
These past years

748
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,840
over my marriage prospects,

749
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,280
you've searched so many houses.

750
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,080
After all the picking here and there,

751
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,440
in the end,

752
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,680
you thought Brother Hongwen was still the best.

753
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,240
Because you also know that

754
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,080
he's an upright gentleman.

755
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,280
When you get acquainted with someone,

756
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,880
the most important is still the other's weakness.

757
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,800
Weakness?

758
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,000
Yes. The weakest point of one's character.

759
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,640
Sister Shulan married a provincial scholar,

760
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,240
and his weakest point is that he's shameless.

761
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,320
Brother Hongwen's weakness

762
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,680
is at worst that he's too soft-hearted.

763
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,080
When you live with someone for decades,

764
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,200
in the end, you have to see

765
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,640
if the other person's weakness

766
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,840
is something you can tolerate.

767
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,040
You've really grown up indeed.

768
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,200
And what's next?

769
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,520
Just sit and wait?

770
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,240
Your granddaughter spoke

771
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,600
such harsh words today.

772
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,320
If that He House has the intention,

773
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,440
we will wait a few days.

774
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,760
We will wait

775
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,707
ten days then.

776
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,400
After ten days,

777
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,880
if I still don't receive any news,.

778
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,280
Grandmother, you find another family for me.

779
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,000
In this world,

780
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,520
indeed they are not the only house with a son.

781
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,600
Today,

782
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,400
we can't blame Old Madam getting anxious and mad.

783
00:36:02,841 --> 00:36:04,080
You're the daughter of a grand house

784
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,240
and you should've waited,

785
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,790
and He House would've given their response.

786
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,025
You are to blame too.

787
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,745
You're usually very prudent.

788
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,720
How is it that you were fretting

789
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,040
to rush the Miss out this time?

790
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,720
I was just angry and anxious.

791
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,320
Miss, I made a mistake.

792
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,840
About what?

793
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,600
How long will we wait?

794
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,880
It can't be that we wait

795
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,160
until Grandmother goes and asks by herself?

796
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,520
Then when that Miss Cao

797
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,080
comes into the family

798
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,440
or after I'm married over,

799
00:36:30,832 --> 00:36:32,680
Cao House sheds tears mixed with snot

800
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,680
and forces me to allow accept their Miss Cao.

801
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,300
Then it's better

802
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,460
to act up now.

803
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,040
Then, if He House agrees,

804
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,600
and they regret later, then will we do?

805
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,360
There will be a way somehow.

806
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,120
Your miss is not

807
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,720
a sheep that everyone gets to fool with.

808
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,785
I have a merciful and doting grandmother.

809
00:36:51,785 --> 00:36:53,720
I have a father and a brother who are officials.

810
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,752
And an older sister

811
00:36:55,752 --> 00:36:56,560
who's married into a noble home.

812
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,880
I've got such strong backing,

813
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,120
and I won't be bullied.

814
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,000
Miss,

815
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,680
but don't forget about Mistress Lin.

816
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,440
She was just like this back then,

817
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,840
pitiful and saying

818
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,240
she had nowhere else to go.

819
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,080
That's how she entered our home.

820
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,360
That Mistress Lin? She's just a

821
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,080
devilish wolf who's draped a sheepskin over herself.

822
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,320
If you understand

823
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,360
her tactics more,

824
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,360
it can all be easily fathomed.

825
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,080
But that Miss Cao,

826
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,240
she has no hope.

827
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,640
I think the way

828
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,640
she looks at He Brother.

829
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,120
It's like

830
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,480
a ghost in hell admiring the human world.

831
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,760
I think it's real.

832
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,320
Then

833
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,200
you've softened up?

834
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,760
Being softened up or not

835
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,320
depends on

836
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,560
how Brother He chooses.

837
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:53,080
I think that Young Master He

838
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,360
is a sensible person.

839
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,400
He won't

840
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,000
abandon our miss

841
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,440
to choose that Cao Jingxiu.

842
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,280
Doesn't matter who he chooses,

843
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,160
I won't resent it no matter what.

844
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,920
If he really chooses Miss Cao,

845
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,840
I might actually respect him.

846
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,200
In this world, not many

847
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,680
will dump their new prospect over an old one.

848
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,360
Miss, I don't understand again.

849
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,120
Miss is tired.

850
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,240
Let her rest early.

851
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,120
Don't bother her anymore.

852
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,920
To live for myself once.

853
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,240
I don't dare to think of it.

854
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,000
Brother Jing,

855
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,800
I also have my difficulties.

856
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,720
Stop there.

857
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,680
Stop! Stop right there!

858
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,400
Fifth Sister.

859
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,480
What are you doiing here?

860
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,720
I ate too much and feel bloated,

861
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,950
so I came to digest.

862
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Is that true?

863
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:30,600
Then you . . .

864
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,040
Fifth sister.

865
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,000
What are you doing here?

866
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,240
I ate too much too and came to digest.

867
00:40:34,662 --> 00:40:35,320
Good.

868
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,700
Then I'm going back to my room.

869
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,860
Please do not go back to home.

870
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,360
Teach me some needlework.

871
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,120
Come to my room.

872
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,560
Fifth Sister.

873
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,880
It,it's so late.

874
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,720
We can't see well,

875
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,470
so let's do it tomorrow.

876
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,410
I'll burn a roomful of candles for you!

877
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,840
Come! Talk to me for a while.

878
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,320
I need to go back.

879
00:40:49,386 --> 00:40:50,040
and teach you how to woven

880
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:51,400
It's time to sleep.

881
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,100
Come on.

882
00:40:53,849 --> 00:40:55,040
Hurry and come in.

883
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,480
Five sister.

884
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,240
I turely see nothing.

885
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,300
You...

886
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,040
Sit down.

887
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,040
You're acting dumb on purpose.

888
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,320
Let me tell you this.

889
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,840
You can't tell anyone,

890
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,600
no matter who. Got it?

891
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,720
Fifth Sister,

892
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,400
why this fretting?

893
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,800
It's no big deal anyway.

894
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,440
Father wanted to find a son-in-law

895
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,440
among the scholars

896
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,680
for the spring exam anyway.

897
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,940
So what if he finds out?

898
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,400
What do you mean it's no matter?

899
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,760
He...

900
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,320
He isn't.

901
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,240
Isn't what?

902
00:41:34,975 --> 00:41:37,240
He's not from an official's house.

903
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,010
Father always devotes himself as an honest man.

904
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,120
A son from a poor family

905
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,320
might delight him more.

906
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,280
He's Wen Yanjing.

907
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,240
Who?

908
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,280
Wen Yanjing.

909
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,040
That's Fourth Sister's...

910
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,600
He's shameless.

911
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:03,760
He lost the match with Fourth Sister

912
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,720
and he comes to bother you!

913
00:42:05,084 --> 00:42:06,560
What are you saying?

914
00:42:07,174 --> 00:42:08,240
Brother Jing

915
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,220
is a complete gentleman,

916
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,840
and he liked me first.

917
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,520
At the time,

918
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,225
Father wanted to

919
00:42:16,225 --> 00:42:17,240
pick a son-in-law for Fourth Sister.

920
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,760
And he selected him

921
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,520
and had him come

922
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,000
and have tea at home.

923
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:24,000
Yes, so Second Brother came back and also said

924
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,760
that Scholar Wen

925
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,240
is a loyal and upright man.

926
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,480
And his studies are good

927
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,840
and hopeful for officialdom in the future.

928
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,960
It was the time

929
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,090
that I lost my handkerchief in the yard.

930
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,800
Brother Wen passed by,

931
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,410
and thought I was a junior maidservant.

932
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,240
He picked up the handkerchief for me.

933
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,480
Then later,

934
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,960
he came a few more times.

935
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,480
Each time, I waited in the garden

936
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,320
so I could talk to him.

937
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,680
He said, I was pretty.

938
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,320
That I'm spirited and clever.

939
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,520
That I make people feel bright-hearted.

940
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,400
He said that sincerely,

941
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,400
or to flatter you?

942
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,920
What do you know?

943
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,960
Later, he found out

944
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,520
I was Sheng House's legitimate daughter.

945
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,160
And he also knew that

946
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,025
Father wanted him to marry

947
00:43:11,025 --> 00:43:11,960
the concubine-born daughter

948
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,640
so he wrote me a letter.

949
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,000
He said that Father and Elder Brother

950
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,360
treated him kindly in acknowledging him

951
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,700
and he can't defy their grace.

952
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,600
So he wouldn't ever see me again.

953
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,000
Really?

954
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,400
Of course it's true.

955
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,600
I still have the letter now.

956
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,720
At the time, I already had him in my heart.

957
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,745
Whatever he says,

958
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,960
I will go along.

959
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,330
If he were crooked-minded,

960
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,520
he could've

961
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,880
just clung onto me.

962
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,160
But he didn't.

963
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,720
He's an upright man then.

964
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:44,880
Where's the letter?

965
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:45,920
Hurry and burn it.

966
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,760
I can't bear to.

967
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,320
I want to keep it forever.
