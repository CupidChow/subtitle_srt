00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,031 --> 00:01:02,976
Episode 20

3
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,040
Quickly go to scrub the pail

4
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,972
and then bring the Young Master

5
00:01:26,972 --> 00:01:27,920
some sobering-up soup.

6
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,680
Go.

7
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,480
Young Master,

8
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,320
there's no big deal

9
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,680
in leaving the Gu family.

10
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,120
How can we not live?

11
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,760
Living one's days happily

12
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,120
is more important than anything.

13
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,840
That Marquis Manor of yours

14
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,400
is like living in a circus every day.

15
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,160
So pretentious. Not fun at all.

16
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,000
In the future, even if you are penniless,

17
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,320
I'll go to wash and

18
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,120
sew clothes to provide for you.

19
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,840
Nanny,

20
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,560
we won't end up like that.

21
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,560
What if we really do?

22
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,400
Don't I have salt farms

23
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,520
under my name?

24
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,527
The government only provides

25
00:02:23,527 --> 00:02:24,520
salt permits twice a year.

26
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,320
Selling salt without a permit is illegal.

27
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,280
If you're caught, you'll get executed.

28
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,308
Before, the local office

29
00:02:33,308 --> 00:02:34,520
gave considerations to the Marquis

30
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,520
and delivered you the salt permits

31
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,240
without the need to talk to you.

32
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,160
Now you're no longer

33
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,640
a member of the House of Gu.

34
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,000
Will that local official still be so eagerly attentive?

35
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,680
You must prepare yourself

36
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,440
for the future hardships.

37
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,560
Nanny,

38
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,240
no matter what my status is,

39
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,240
my position is,

40
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,120
the people who really love me

41
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,760
are only you and Manniang.

42
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,960
For you two,

43
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,440
even if I have to do hard labor on the docks,

44
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,760
I can endure it.

45
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,440
Young Master,

46
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,920
if you give me importance,

47
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,920
I have to say a few words.

48
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,120
That Manniang of yours

49
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,400
isn't a good woman.

50
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,920
Nanny.

51
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,440
It will be the three of us

52
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,600
relying on each other from now on.

53
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,440
Don't say such things again.

54
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,276
Young Master, when you sought marriage

55
00:03:58,276 --> 00:03:59,280
with the Eldest Miss Yu,

56
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,280
she went there and foiled it.

57
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,040
Fortunately,

58
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,080
the House of Yu endured it

59
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,420
and was willing to marry off

60
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,360
Third Miss Yu to you instead.

61
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,080
But don't know why,

62
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,760
it ended up like this today!

63
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,560
Are all of these matters

64
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,120
just mere coincidences?

65
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,240
Nanny.

66
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,720
Let's just talk some other time.

67
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,400
My head aches so much.

68
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,560
I want to sleep.

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,760
Fine. Fine.

70
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,960
Let me just ask you one question.

71
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,360
You didn't tell her about you inheriting the assets

72
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,080
of the Bai family, right?

73
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,000
I didn't.

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,320
Why would I tell her?

75
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,800
I didn't even tell Changbai about it.

76
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,642
Anyway, let's just give Manniang

77
00:04:50,642 --> 00:04:51,602
whatever she wants.

78
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,000
If I tell her this,

79
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,520
it's as if I'm deliberately

80
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,440
showing off my wealth.

81
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,960
I'll look bad.

82
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,520
That's good then.

83
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,280
Young Master, you can refuse

84
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,840
to believe what I've just said.

85
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,000
Give it a try then.

86
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,920
You can talk about anything

87
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,240
except the salt farms of the House

88
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,640
of Bai in Yangzhou.

89
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,040
Just say that

90
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,640
you don't have much money now.

91
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,132
If she's real gold that isn't afraid

92
00:05:21,132 --> 00:05:21,960
of the oven fire,

93
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,120
I'll shut my mouth from now on

94
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,400
and raise your children in peace.

95
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,520
Darling Second, here.

96
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,920
Drink some sobering-up soup, then go to rest.

97
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,760
Young Master,

98
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,320
you haven't told me

99
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,360
why you fought

100
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,680
with your family like this.

101
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,640
Just for some unimportant matters.

102
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,720
Darling Second, is your head still painful?

103
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,440
If you can't sleep,

104
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,680
you can embrace me.

105
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,360
I'll accompany you.

106
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,000
Are you willing to stay by my side forever?

107
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,200
I will.

108
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,240
No matter if I'm the legitimate child

109
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,480
of Marquis Manor?

110
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,000
When I met you,

111
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,880
I didn't know

112
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,400
that you're a legitimate child of a marquis.

113
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,080
Manniang,

114
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,240
I might not be able to

115
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,360
extravagantly spend for you from now on.

116
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,760
In the future,

117
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,240
I might need to depend on

118
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,440
doing manual labor to live by.

119
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,080
You must go to wash and mend clothes.

120
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,880
Only in this way can we have food to eat.

121
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,040
With this kind of life,

122
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,960
are you still willing to be with me?

123
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,000
Darling Second,

124
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,014
for a person with such an awe-inspiring

125
00:07:29,014 --> 00:07:29,560
presence like yours,

126
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,130
how can you be doing manual labor

127
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,120
to earn a living?

128
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,798
My civil examination path has been blocked off

129
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,238
by the officials.

130
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,720
What else can I do?

131
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,160
I might really have to rely on manual labor

132
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,000
to live out my days.

133
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,320
I'll still accompany you.

134
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,400
Manniang,

135
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,440
I only have you.

136
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,200
I only have this house left.

137
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,120
Our whole family...

138
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,800
will accompany you.

139
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,920
Greetings, Father.

140
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,920
If Father has no more instructions,

141
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,000
I'll take my leave.

142
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,120
Bai'er.

143
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,840
Do you already know the matter about

144
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,000
that rebellious son of the House of Gu?

145
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,120
You don't need to cover up for him.

146
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,240
He's famous all over the capital.

147
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,640
Yes.

148
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,869
I know that you two are good friends

149
00:10:23,869 --> 00:10:24,560
for so many years,

150
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,840
but you are a child who knows propriety.

151
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,960
You are even the legitimate son of our family.

152
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,721
Now the marriage talks with the House of Hai

153
00:10:32,721 --> 00:10:33,400
have been settled.

154
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,400
You have a great future ahead of you.

155
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,160
Don't delay yourself,

156
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:37,840
and the whole family,

157
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,760
just because of a moment of emotion.

158
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,560
Second Brother!

159
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,720
Second Brother.

160
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,800
I saw you frequently go out lately.

161
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,880
You must be on your way to visit someone?

162
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,240
He's sick.

163
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,240
He...

164
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,400
He has always been very stable.

165
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,960
I have never seen him get sick.

166
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,680
One's family broken up like that,

167
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,040
his parents now both dead.

168
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,520
Only a few people can go through that

169
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,280
without collapsing.

170
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,360
It's all thanks to him

171
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,960
before that I found a doctor.

172
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,400
Now that he's in trouble,

173
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,040
there's not much where I can help.

174
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,840
I...made some cakes and porridge.

175
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,680
I want to ask Second Brother to bring it to him

176
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,240
on my behalf.

177
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,280
Knowing to repay a debt of gratitude is one of

178
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,000
a great righteousnesses of this world.

179
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,080
This is very good.

180
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,440
Go back now.

181
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,720
You're already this sick.

182
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,800
How can you not eat?

183
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,480
When my Sixth Little Sister heard

184
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,720
that I was going to visit you,

185
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,960
she especially had me bring some jade-leaf cakes...

186
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,480
and fish porridge.

187
00:13:10,313 --> 00:13:12,113
She made it very lightly-flavored.

188
00:13:12,113 --> 00:13:12,993
At least, eat a little.

189
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,744
I've paid my respects to Marquis Manor

190
00:13:19,744 --> 00:13:20,200
on your behalf.

191
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,823
These past days,

192
00:13:22,823 --> 00:13:24,440
the whole of House of Gu is quite busy.

193
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,000
They've finally able to set up the funeral stage.

194
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,280
The whole house has

195
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,520
white cloth hanging on it.

196
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,960
They've also changed into funeral clothes.

197
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,680
Did they mention me?

198
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,080
Only when I bumped into your Third Younger Brother,

199
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,002
he asked me where you lived

200
00:13:42,002 --> 00:13:42,962
and wanted to come to visit you.

201
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,640
Forget it.

202
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,860
You think I can still wear

203
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,720
my filial funeral clothes?

204
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,600
I met an elder from your clan that especially traveled

205
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,320
from your hometown.

206
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,562
He didn't say that your name

207
00:14:00,562 --> 00:14:01,240
has been removed from your clan.

208
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:06,720
That's strange.

209
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,720
They hated me so much.

210
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,200
They didn't erase me

211
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,720
from our genealogy book?

212
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,200
If they really erased my name,

213
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:17,920
wouldn't that

214
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,200
save them a lot of trouble?

215
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,480
Maybe...

216
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,480
Eldest Young Master Sheng,

217
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,000
just chat with Darling Second.

218
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,600
I'll go to buy some food

219
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,760
and make lunch later.

220
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,240
Eldest Young Master Sheng, please stay to taste them.

221
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,760
My Sixth

222
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,240
I've brought him some fish porridge.

223
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,080
No need for extra trouble.

224
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,760
It's still better that I make

225
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,600
Eldest Young Master Sheng some delicious food.

226
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,680
Let me have a taste of that fish porridge.

227
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,080
Here.

228
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,040
The culinary skills of your Sixth Little Sister

229
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,720
are indeed outstanding.

230
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,920
Say, even though

231
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,240
the House of Gu is a warrior clan,

232
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,560
they are still a very rule-abiding house.

233
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,040
They would rather die than

234
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,920
let that lowly bitch enter their house.

235
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,680
Madam Wang, you're here.

236
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,320
Last time,

237
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,680
it was a white jade waist belt.

238
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,560
What is it today?

239
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,640
This is quite a good item.

240
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:48,480
Is this waist accessory

241
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,920
made of red coral?

242
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,080
You're right.

243
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,920
Selling it again?

244
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:52,922
I'm good with anything.

245
00:16:52,922 --> 00:16:53,400
I'm only concerned with the money.

246
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,920
Okay.

247
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,760
Okay, this way please.

248
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,360
It was even she who asked for leniency

249
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,137
to allow Second Young Master

250
00:17:01,137 --> 00:17:02,120
to pay his respect before leaving.

251
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,160
It was really hard for her.

252
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,808
It was really Nanny Chang

253
00:17:30,808 --> 00:17:31,640
who called for you to come here.

254
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,840
She even said that

255
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,120
you two must talk in a quiet place.

256
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,880
Isn't our house the quietest place?

257
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,000
Young Master, we're here.

258
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,560
Young Master.

259
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,600
Nanny, why did you make me come here to talk?

260
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,880
These past days,

261
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,080
I kept asking

262
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,280
for money from you.

263
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,800
I would ask in tens to hundreds of coins each time.

264
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,720
If I was unable to carry them myself,

265
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,280
I would ask you to give them to me as paper money.

266
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,480
I'm sure Young Master has been puzzled

267
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,040
with it for a long time.

268
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,680
These are the items I've bought.

269
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,920
What did you buy?

270
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,440
Aren't these my mother's accessories?

271
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,000
It almost wasn't yours!

272
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,600
The waist accessory was bought by me

273
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,440
from the Hu Gold and Silver Shop.

274
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:35,800
As for

275
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,200
the rest,

276
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,040
I've bought them from the Shengping Pawnshop.

277
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,400
What do you mean?

278
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,280
It's a good thing that you didn't tell

279
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,200
that lowly bitch Zhu Manniang

280
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,800
about the Bai family matters.

281
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,791
Now that she believes that

282
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:54,760
you are indeed penniless,

283
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,480
she has started to have disloyal intent.

284
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,199
While there are a lot of things

285
00:18:58,199 --> 00:18:58,680
to be handled at home,

286
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,760
she has pawned the jewelry, farmlands,

287
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,320
and shops that you owned.

288
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,160
I rushed to buy back a few of them.

289
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,840
But for the farmlands and shops,

290
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,040
the prices being asked were too expensive.

291
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,160
I was unable to buy them back.

292
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,680
Once you've driven her away,

293
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,920
you can just buy them back yourself.

294
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,840
This is impossible.

295
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,960
Young Master, look.

296
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,920
I've followed her for more than ten days.

297
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,040
She will hide the items

298
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,880
in a concealed part

299
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,360
of the kitchen every night.

300
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:37,796
And then in the morning,

301
00:19:37,796 --> 00:19:38,840
when she buys ingredients from the market,

302
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,800
she will hand it to a man.

303
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,280
I wanted to tell it to you when I discovered it.

304
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,560
But you were sick then

305
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,720
so I was afraid you wouldn't be able to take it.

306
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,240
I could only hide

307
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,240
those valuable ones first,

308
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,160
but the house is only that big!

309
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,240
How long can I hide them?

310
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,560
She was able to find most of them.

311
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,760
Now you're better,

312
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,640
but not many valuables

313
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,920
are left in our house!

314
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,840
Impossible...

315
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,120
Impossible...

316
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,000
Young Master Ye!

317
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,237
Could it be that our servants stole them from us

318
00:20:21,237 --> 00:20:21,840
and sold them outside?

319
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,800
I personally saw her enter the pawnshop!

320
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,320
Young Master Ye!

321
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,000
Has your heart been blinded by pig oil?

322
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,840
She's not a good person!

323
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:35,480
Young Master Ye!

324
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,320
Nanny...

325
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,600
While a person is alive,

326
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,920
no matter how huge a problem is,

327
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,600
avoiding it is useless.

328
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,680
I know.

329
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,880
I know that you

330
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,960
treat her as your heart's solace,

331
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,960
hence you're refusing to admit it.

332
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,440
But are you willing

333
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,278
to be played with by others in the palm

334
00:20:54,278 --> 00:20:54,920
of their hands?

335
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,920
To say something that's overstepping my boundary,

336
00:20:59,480 --> 00:20:59,960
I've treated you

337
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,600
like my own child.

338
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,840
I know that in your heart,

339
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,240
you have

340
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,240
a place for me.

341
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,160
I won't beg you

342
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,440
to trust me now,

343
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,960
I only beg you to personally follow

344
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,080
that woman tomorrow!

345
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,200
If she obediently comes home

346
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,320
upon buying some food,

347
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,440
I will never mention this matter again!

348
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,560
Young Master.

349
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,960
Young Master, look.

350
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,520
He's actually alive.

351
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,560
Darling Second, you are back.

352
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,242
You have been out for the whole day.

353
00:22:37,242 --> 00:22:37,922
You must be tired.

354
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,320
Come.

355
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,640
The meal has already been cooked.

356
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,520
I will get it for you later.

357
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,040
What's wrong?

358
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,280
Manniang,

359
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,640
I have something to ask you.

360
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,560
What is it? Once we get done eating,

361
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,120
you can ask me again later.

362
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,840
I'm asking now.

363
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,960
Okay, fine.

364
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,000
Darling Second, just ask if you have anything to ask.

365
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,920
I'm listening.

366
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,760
I promised Nanny Chang that

367
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,360
I would give her a coffin.

368
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,000
Now I'm poor and frustrated,

369
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,040
but I can't break my promise to her.

370
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,360
I was thinking,

371
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,840
we still have some money

372
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,960
and can make some preparations in advance for her.

373
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,720
I found a carpenter

374
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,840
and gave him five taels in silver as deposit.

375
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,880
As for the balance, I will gradually pay it.

376
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,160
It's just that,

377
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,600
I'm a bit tight with money now.

378
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,040
I was thinking.

379
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,800
I gave the children

380
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,360
two gold locks.

381
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,280
Go to look for them and bring them to me now.

382
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,040
I...

383
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,240
I don't know where they are.

384
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,720
I will look for them tomorrow and give them to you.

385
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,960
I will look for the money now.

386
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,000
It's dark now, and I can't see clearly.

387
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,560
I don't know where I put them.

388
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,880
Light the candle then.

389
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,800
Light every single

390
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,760
candle in the house.

391
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,920
Darling Second...

392
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,040
those golden locks...

393
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,760
I sold them.

394
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,040
Nanny Chang told me that

395
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,640
we will be having a hard time in the future.

396
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,400
I've given it a lot of thought,

397
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,435
and decided to sell the jewelry

398
00:25:17,435 --> 00:25:18,040
and antiques for money,

399
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,320
rather than just leaving them here

400
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,840
in the house for display.

401
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,600
Running some small business

402
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,520
is also a way to make a living.

403
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,800
It's not important that we have a hard time.

404
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,520
What's important is that we can still

405
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,960
support our children.

406
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,560
Why did you hide this from me?

407
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,720
We have been rich before.

408
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,280
Now we have to live our days

409
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,200
by pawning valuables.

410
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,160
I was afraid that you wouldn't be able to take it.

411
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,320
That's why I hid it from you.

412
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,440
The Old Marquis just passed away.

413
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,720
Look at the way the Gu family treats you.

414
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,120
There are many matters pressing on us.

415
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,760
Since young,

416
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,680
I have been growing up in poverty and hardship.

417
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,760
I don't care about pawning anything.

418
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,920
But Darling Second,

419
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,720
you grew up with a silver spoon.

420
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,040
I was afraid you wouldn't be able to take it.

421
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,280
That's why

422
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,800
I thought of selling them first

423
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,280
and then tell you about it later.

424
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,440
Darling Second,

425
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,680
if you think that I tricked you,

426
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,240
you...

427
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,840
Just kill me with a sword!

428
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,000
I have been sincere

429
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,320
and serving you for many years.

430
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,520
If you kill me,

431
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,600
I won't blame you either!

432
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,200
It's just that,

433
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,200
before I die,

434
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,480
let me see

435
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,720
my children first.

436
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,560
These two children are very pitiful.

437
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,880
As long as you can raise them

438
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,280
well in the future,

439
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,280
I will die without any regrets.

440
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,040
Darling Second!

441
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:25,920
Stop being foolish.

442
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,600
This is Dongjing,

443
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,680
under the feet of the Emperor.

444
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,440
How can anyone be killed at random?

445
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,880
You only sold some gold

446
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,360
and silver jewelry.

447
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,920
How can this be an offense requiring a death?

448
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,400
Darling Second.

449
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,040
Don't blame me, okay?

450
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,080
What else did you hide from me?

451
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,040
Nothing else.

452
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,000
There's nothing else.

453
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,760
You are illiterate.

454
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,800
I will read it to you.

455
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,920
"Almost thirty hectare of fertile land

456
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,760
in the Dongsan Village of Guojia Farm,

457
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,600
western outskirts of Bianjing."

458
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,385
"Southern side of the Niu Farm in the eastern

459
00:28:45,385 --> 00:28:47,800
outskirts of Rongde in Sichuan...

460
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,440
over twenty hectare of dry land."

461
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,800
This...what is this?

462
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,280
"Thirty salt shops on Yangzhou Road."

463
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,440
Manniang,

464
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,760
I'm asking you one more time.

465
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,960
What else did you hide from me?

466
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,680
As long as you tell me,

467
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,920
I will let bygones be bygones.

468
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:30,986
You are still asking me

469
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,280
what else I have hidden from you?

470
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,400
I would like to ask you, Darling Second,

471
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,600
why did you trick me instead?

472
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,080
When did I trick you?

473
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,720
You are very cruel!

474
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,280
You caused me to think that

475
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,920
we are running out of rice soon.

476
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,560
I didn't even want my dignity!

477
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,175
I went out to pawn things

478
00:29:51,175 --> 00:29:52,200
so we could get on with our days.

479
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,480
How many supercilious looks must I endure?

480
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,280
Who knew that

481
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,440
you would hide your personal assets that well?

482
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,247
You said you did this for

483
00:30:01,247 --> 00:30:02,440
our children's sake and my own.

484
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,360
Why did you trick me?

485
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,120
So you're saying I should be apologetic

486
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,680
toward you instead?

487
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,640
What are you doing? Oh my God.

488
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,280
Look.

489
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,360
The pawnshop at Yongle street

490
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,640
in Suzhou deed,

491
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,960
you burned it!

492
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,040
This one asset could have supported us

493
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,320
for a lifetime!

494
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,360
Didn't you say you were illiterate?

495
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,920
How did you manage to understand

496
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,400
every single word on this deed?

497
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,000
Manniang,

498
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,560
I'm asking you the last time.

499
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,640
What else did you hide from me?

500
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,520
N-Nothing. Nothing else.

501
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,400
Bring him in!

502
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,120
Brother?

503
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,400
You said that your older brother tricked you

504
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,960
out of your savings

505
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,600
and later died on the way.

506
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,680
You had no one to rely on and took shelter with me.

507
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:50,000
I gave you money for shelter

508
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,160
and bought a grave for you,

509
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,120
and personally witnessed your older brother's coffin

510
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:54,880
being lowered in the ground!

511
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,240
I'm asking you now.

512
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,480
What else are you hiding from me?

513
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,680
Isn't this the biggest joke?

514
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,760
Darling Second, Darling Second!

515
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,640
I was tricked

516
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,320
by my older brother.

517
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,640
I was tricked by him!

518
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,240
Darling Second...

519
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,760
Manniang,

520
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,760
if you didn't see

521
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,520
that I was wealthy now,

522
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,480
I fear you and your older brother

523
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,880
would have run away with the shop.

524
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,120
Thanks to me for always speaking up

525
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,400
on your behalf in front of my nanny,

526
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:37,000
and insisting that I didn't misjudge you.

527
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,640
Darling Second!

528
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,080
Darling Second...

529
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,360
Take your so-called deceased older brother,

530
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,680
and get lost

531
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,160
tomorrow morning.

532
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,760
Darling Second?

533
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,640
Darling Second! Darling Second!

534
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,520
Get in there!

535
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,480
Darling Second...

536
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,840
For the sake of the children,

537
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:58,400
forgive me this time.

538
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,600
Let me stay in the house.

539
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,920
Darling Second...

540
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,280
I don't want any title.

541
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,200
I'm fine not being an outside mistress either.

542
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,440
Just treat me...

543
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,240
as an additional female attendant

544
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,480
in the house.

545
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,880
The two children can't

546
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,160
lose their biological mother.

547
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,280
Darling Second, you are a kind person.

548
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,960
You gave me those funds,

549
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,000
but my hateful older brother

550
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,200
lost them all

551
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,360
in gambling.

552
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,880
He asked me to repeatedly fool you

553
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,480
to get him those items.

554
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,280
I was just forced to do it.

555
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,760
He said...

556
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,680
that if I didn't give him that money,

557
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,320
he would abduct the two children.

558
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,680
He would kidnap them!

559
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,840
Darling Second,

560
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,120
I don't have any skills.

561
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,333
If I wander around,

562
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:27,840
I won't have any family to rely on.

563
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,760
I really have no choice left!

564
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,160
If I were still penniless now,

565
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,880
would you still cry and shout like that

566
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,640
so that you can stay?

567
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,000
I would.

568
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,760
I would.

569
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,120
Darling Second

570
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,400
Since you were little, you haven't had a mother

571
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,920
to take care of you.

572
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,200
You know the hardship of two children not

573
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,360
having an intimate family by their side.

574
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,240
I beg you that for the sake of the children,

575
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,760
forgive me this one time.

576
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,240
Let me stay in this house!

577
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,440
Darling Second...

578
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,440
It's exactly because of the children

579
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,200
and because of you

580
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,880
that I sought the House of Yu for marriage.

581
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,600
But they repeatedly refused it.

582
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,560
What was the reason?

583
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:41,960
Their family...

584
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,680
disliked my lowly background.

585
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,120
They wouldn't allow their legitimate daughter

586
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,120
to attend to you together with me.

587
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,400
The House of Yu is already like that.

588
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,360
How much more the other noble families,

589
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,160
Darling Second?

590
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,560
You're still lying to me!

591
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,880
I repeatedly gave you a chance.

592
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,560
In my heart, I still think you to be kind.

593
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,800
But did you tell me any truths?

594
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,080
Even one truth!

595
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,480
Darling Second...

596
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,560
Darling Second...

597
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,200
Manniang,

598
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:41,080
you said that you were left with no choice.

599
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,520
That you can only die.

600
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,440
So delicate.

601
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,480
So bashful.

602
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,400
You cause people to pity you.

603
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,120
I then settled you down.

604
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,560
For you, I exerted all efforts.

605
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,000
I had children with you.

606
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,600
For you,

607
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,760
I sought marriage with the House of Yu.

608
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:15,920
But you...

609
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,478
First, you caused Old Madam Yu

610
00:38:20,478 --> 00:38:21,480
to faint from anger.

611
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:26,520
Next, you fooled Xiaocui

612
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,364
so she brought the children to

613
00:38:28,364 --> 00:38:29,200
destroy my marriage plan.

614
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:32,120
Why did you do

615
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,840
all these things?

616
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,880
Don't you just want to

617
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,840
become the main wife of my Marquis Manor?

618
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,560
but now

619
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,240
I'm now penniless.

620
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,480
You then thought of taking away all my wealth

621
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:54,228
and look for another rich man

622
00:38:54,228 --> 00:38:54,760
to make connections with.

623
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:56,960
I've seen through

624
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,920
so many schemes and intrigues.

625
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,760
I never suspected you!

626
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,440
Never once!

627
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,440
What's the use of killing you?

628
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,960
I'm the one who's stupid.

629
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,240
I got harmed by you.

630
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,120
I got fooled by you.

631
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,280
You were able to suck the blood from my neck.

632
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,440
You carried and played with me

633
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,360
like some wooden puppet!

634
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,280
I'm the one who's a dumb.

635
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,360
I admit it.

636
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,240
But if you...

637
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:42,320
if you don't pack your things now and leave

638
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,360
the capital by tomorrow,

639
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,320
I'll make it unbearable for you

640
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,400
to live here in the capital!

641
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:49,640
Darling Second!

642
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,720
Were you able

643
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,920
to hear clearly

644
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,440
every word I said?

645
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,880
Darling Second...

646
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:06,840
What about there?

647
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,640
Nothing.

648
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,440
Also nothing!

649
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,480
Nanny. What about that room?

650
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,000
Nothing there!

651
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,960
What happened? Where did he go?

652
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,320
How come...

653
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,840
Chang'er is missing.

654
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,800
Manniang and her brother

655
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,680
are both missing!

656
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,080
I want my mother!

657
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,920
What are you doing?

658
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,160
Sorry.
