00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Ming Lan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,580
Episode 49

3
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,080
I told you not to intervene in this matter.

4
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,945
Either way, I will be lenient with the punishment

5
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,280
of those brothers of yours.

6
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,880
Why you just don't want to listen to my advice?

7
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,680
Even if you want to beg for leniency

8
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,040
you can just ask privately.

9
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,920
Why must you talk in front of everyone

10
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,760
in the imperial court?

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,960
Tell me

12
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,440
should I be giving this imperial grace or not?

13
00:01:30,387 --> 00:01:30,950
If I give it to you,

14
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:31,797
since you've started the trend

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,240
and everybody comes to beg me,

16
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,360
how can we investigate this case?

17
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,680
If I don't give it to you,

18
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,920
outsiders will say that

19
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,960
we're not united.

20
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,520
All our steps would be difficult from now on!

21
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,000
Indeed.

22
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,240
You were usually a very sensible person.

23
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,200
How come you've become muddled now.

24
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,680
Quickly kneel and ask for punishment.

25
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,640
May Your Majesty forgive me.

26
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,700
Just to clean the name of my birth mother,

27
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,190
Lady Bai,

28
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,720
make her biography and praises

29
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,200
can be written on our ancestral book,

30
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,440
and ask a posthumous title for her,

31
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,840
I have no choice but to save my Gu brothers.

32
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,450
May Your Majesty just

33
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:09,960
keep a blind eye on this matter

34
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,240
just for my sake.

35
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,600
Please confer me some graces.

36
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,360
If not, this official position of mine

37
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,160
becomes meaningless.

38
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,640
I know that you had a hard past life.

39
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,720
What graces

40
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,800
didn't I give you?

41
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,225
What I'm angry at is you acting by yourself

42
00:02:28,225 --> 00:02:29,040
without regard for others.

43
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,560
Your Majesty,

44
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,760
the reason I begged for leniency

45
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,560
in front of all the other high officials

46
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,640
in the imperial court

47
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,560
is I was afraid that you'll be criticized

48
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,880
at by them in the future.

49
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,000
If Your Majesty would be lenient

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,080
to our Gu Clan in private,

51
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,525
I'm afraid that others will say

52
00:02:46,525 --> 00:02:47,680
that you're being biased on me.

53
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,240
This is better.

54
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,520
In front of everyone,

55
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,240
they saw me pressuring you.

56
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,400
His Majesty then has no choice

57
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,000
but to agree.

58
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,280
You are always on the right.

59
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,120
So letting others see

60
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,400
how we lose harmony

61
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,920
is a good thing?

62
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,720
Your Majesty, as long as you know

63
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,760
that I'm united with you in heart and morality,

64
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,760
that's enough.

65
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,880
The opinions of others are not important.

66
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,240
Fine. Fine. Leave now.

67
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,360
This...

68
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,320
Then, about the Gu Family's matters...

69
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,520
I've already agreed in front of everyone.

70
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,640
Can I still take it back?

71
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,000
Just this once. No more next time.

72
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,280
Or else, I'll remove you from your post

73
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,040
and let you go farm in Yuzhou!

74
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,160
Thank you, Your Majesty! Thank you, Royal Father!

75
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,560
I told you that it will word.

76
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,040
You won't believe me.

77
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,120
Let's go.

78
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,120
Your Majesty, please don't be mad.

79
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,240
Your Majesty.

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,080
When did you arrive?

81
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,440
I was here since earlier

82
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,840
and just waiting outside.

83
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,760
Your Majesty,

84
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,040
please taste the dish that I've personally made.

85
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,080
I don't have the appetite. You eat it yourself.

86
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,400
Your Majesty,

87
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,680
I've worked for the whole day.

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,840
Just leave it. I'm unable to eat.

89
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,680
Your Majesty, you just took back

90
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,880
the jade seal from Empress Dowager.

91
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,400
General Gu indeed is meritorious

92
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,440
for suggesting the plan.

93
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,400
But now, he has become so arrogant and despotic.

94
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,320
What will he become in the future?

95
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,040
What being united in voice and breath?

96
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,000
I think

97
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,925
that he's only united in voice

98
00:04:54,925 --> 00:04:55,760
and breath with Prince Huan.

99
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,680
Shut up! Get out!

100
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,320
Your Majesty, don't be mad.

101
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,440
Leave! Leave!

102
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,120
Yes.

103
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,160
Your Majesty, calm down! Calm down!

104
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,520
Third Young Master!

105
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,240
Nanny Xiang.

106
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,320
Come on, get into the carriage.

107
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,360
Thank you.

108
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,040
Hope your Young Master Gu

109
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,920
won't see us again.

110
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,080
Hope your words will come true.

111
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,760
Tingwei!

112
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,600
Mother!

113
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,640
My son has suffered.

114
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,600
Mother...

115
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,760
Did you get flogged?

116
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,040
Mother, I heard...

117
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,200
that eldest brother has gone.

118
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,640
Didn't the doctor say that his health

119
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,200
is getting better?

120
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,280
Was it because we were imprisoned,

121
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,000
eldest brother's health worsened out of anger?

122
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,920
Why do you still have time to care about him?

123
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,520
Did you get torture?

124
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,280
Were you starved?

125
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,960
Thank you to Second Brother,

126
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,520
I'm quite well.

127
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,720
Brother Bing got mauled,

128
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,200
but they've also been released.

129
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,000
The one from the Fifth House

130
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,840
has been released with you.

131
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,320
Tingbing from the Fourth House

132
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,560
got sentenced of exiling.

133
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,925
Just let the Fourth House

134
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:16,880
fight it out with Second.

135
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,720
We don't have to worry about it.

136
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,840
What's there still to fight about?

137
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,080
Second Brother is currently holding great power.

138
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,720
There were so many people who

139
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,200
got implicated in this rebellion case.

140
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,200
For me to come out of prison is good karma

141
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,880
accumulated by our ancestors.

142
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,800
You're so useless.

143
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,240
This is clearly

144
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,920
that Young Lord Qi

145
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,840
going against that Gu Tingye.

146
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,440
You're just sitting in your house,

147
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,480
but disaster still fell from the sky.

148
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,880
No.

149
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,760
Didn't they say that

150
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,640
it was because I took in

151
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,520
those female attendants that were initially

152
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,720
bought for the rebel prince?

153
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,200
For such a trifle matter,

154
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,400
at most, you could just be lightly punished,

155
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,200
didn't have to reach the Ministry of Justice.

156
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,480
Let's go home.

157
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,080
Slowly.

158
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,320
Take this away.

159
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,720
Let's go.

160
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,920
You've now been pardoned.

161
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,000
And your eldest brother is gone.

162
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,240
I must think of a way to go out, move around,

163
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,360
and find you a job.

164
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,160
At home,

165
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,160
just focus on your studies.

166
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,600
At this important time,

167
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,400
stop going to those places of pleasure

168
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,680
to jeer and cause trouble.

169
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,800
You hear me?

170
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,760
Eldest Brother is gone.

171
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,000
Second Brother must be...

172
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,480
He still must pretend to be grieving.

173
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,960
We've all pretended,

174
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,520
but Second Brother never did.

175
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,600
Please contain my grief.

176
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,680
Thank you, Young Lord.

177
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,600
I'll take my leave.

178
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,160
That marquis has such deep thinking.

179
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,720
He was indeed a talent.

180
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,320
Too bad, his life was too short.

181
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,440
If he continued to lead his family,

182
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,520
then the Gu Clan...

183
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,240
The weather is really good today.

184
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,320
Stop the carriage!

185
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,320
What's wrong?

186
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,320
I want to get down and walk.

187
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,720
Walk all the way back to the manor.

188
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,760
I'll accompany you then.

189
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,160
A few days ago,

190
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,360
Gu Tingye made a ruckus

191
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,360
in the court meeting to beg for leniency

192
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,560
in behalf of the Gu Clan.

193
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,680
His Majesty didn't want to

194
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,520
pardon those Gu criminals

195
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,600
because he wanted to scare away those

196
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,560
who intend to do the same crime.

197
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,160
But with Gu Tingye

198
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,160
doing such a scene,

199
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,080
His Majesty has no choice

200
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,000
but to give him this favor,

201
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,025
so that he won't lose the loyalty of a man

202
00:09:44,025 --> 00:09:45,160
who served him before he was emperor.

203
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,080
But by doing that,

204
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,800
the emperor lost a key moment.

205
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,920
Empress Dowager has one more weakness

206
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,520
of the emperor in her hand.

207
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,320
But the emperor still approved his request

208
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,520
in the end,

209
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,040
and swallowed his anger.

210
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,840
So this consoling decree today

211
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,400
was so full of hidden meaning.

212
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,480
It sounded something wasn't right.

213
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,960
No wonder Gu Second

214
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,280
and his wife didn't attend the funeral.

215
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,160
They might be in anger and afraid

216
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,200
inside their house now.

217
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,800
This is an argument inside the court meetings.

218
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,240
It's not a business that women should meddle in.

219
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,920
Although His Majesty is angry,

220
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,240
he's only mad at Gu Tingye.

221
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,240
Yes.

222
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,480
For matters of the imperial court,

223
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,280
women shouldn't comment.

224
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,120
The weather is really good today.

225
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,760
Let's drink some tea before going back.

226
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,680
Husband still couldn't forget

227
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,840
that Big Madam Sheng.

228
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,120
Tormenting

229
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,640
the husband of that Big Madam Sheng

230
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,160
to vent my anger will be good too.

231
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,760
Miss. Miss.

232
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,840
Although you've been raised

233
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,880
in a

234
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,440
luxurious manner,

235
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,280
you actually had a hard life.

236
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,640
Good thing, you were able to have

237
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,240
a capable and filial son like young master.

238
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,600
He was able to earn you a conferred title!

239
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,600
No one would dare to look down on you,

240
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,480
look down on your father,

241
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,040
look down on our Bai Family!

242
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,800
Miss.

243
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,720
I'm also old.

244
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,425
For a major matter like

245
00:12:23,425 --> 00:12:24,440
getting scolded by His Majesty,

246
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,760
you didn't even tell me when you got back.

247
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,680
If not because I noticed that

248
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,275
there was something wrong

249
00:12:29,275 --> 00:12:29,880
with the consoling decree,

250
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,600
you still wouldn't tell me.

251
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,920
The greatest wish of my mother and grandfather

252
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,320
in their life

253
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,800
was to be rid of the merchant status.

254
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,880
Now that she has been conferred a title,

255
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,600
my wish has been fulfilled.

256
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,920
So I don't care if I have offended the emperor?

257
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,280
What?

258
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,800
I did save him

259
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,000
and his son's life after all.

260
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,360
I risked my life

261
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,156
to save them.

262
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,920
His Majesty and I have a relationship

263
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,600
that transcends life and death.

264
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,920
Isn't that enough to earn

265
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,120
my mother a conferred title?

266
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,200
Since time immemorial,

267
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,875
subjects who became arrogant from being

268
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:18,725
satisfied with his achievement,

269
00:13:18,725 --> 00:13:19,720
usually didn't end up well.

270
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,640
Just be at ease and follow me.

271
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,120
I guarantee that nothing will happen to you.

272
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,240
You really don't'm afraid anyone,

273
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,680
even the emperor.

274
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,440
Say,

275
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,050
how come a very cautious person

276
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:36,480
like my Second Brother

277
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,120
would be friends with you?

278
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,560
Even if His Majesty can't control me,

279
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,360
you can.

280
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,520
Son!

281
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,520
Husband...

282
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,200
Once you leave,

283
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,760
what about me?

284
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,880
Okay already.

285
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,880
It's getting late.

286
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,760
If we still don't leave,

287
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,475
we won't be able to reach

288
00:13:59,475 --> 00:14:00,360
a lodging inn during the night.

289
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,480
Sir!

290
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,320
Father!

291
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,640
That asshole Gu Tingye!

292
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,360
He did this deliberately!

293
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,880
All the other Gu members got pardoned,

294
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,325
but how come I'm the only one

295
00:14:15,325 --> 00:14:16,120
sentenced to be exiled?

296
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,000
Isn't it all because

297
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,920
our connections are more inferior?

298
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:21,325
Isn't it because our relationship

299
00:14:21,325 --> 00:14:22,000
with their marquis manor

300
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,240
is not as good as the Fifth House?

301
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,080
How come only my younger brother got sentenced?

302
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,320
Their Fifth House also had interactions

303
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,880
with the rebel prince.

304
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,480
His house

305
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,280
not only gave out beautiful women and girls—

306
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,400
Shut up!

307
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,920
Husband! Husband!

308
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,080
That vile spawn Gu Tingye is

309
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,000
deliberately

310
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,920
making things hard on us!

311
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,920
I don't know

312
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,760
how could our son endure such kind of pain

313
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,760
with his health?

314
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,560
Husband,

315
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,640
think of a way to save him, okay?

316
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,080
Let him go.

317
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,160
I won't accept any favor from that Gu Tingye.

318
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,440
Let's go! Go!

319
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,440
Son!

320
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,080
Husband! Husband!

321
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,650
Intelligence similar to Sun Wu,

322
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,960
has the talent to govern,

323
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,000
has pure air like that of Tong Mountain,

324
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,040
has been taught the classics of Huang Shi,

325
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,575
achieved valiant and imposing merits,

326
00:15:26,575 --> 00:15:28,040
has an upright character,

327
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,375
rose in the military ranks

328
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:30,350
through his own hard work,

329
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,560
very earnest in his useful advice.

330
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,925
Although he has achieved high merit,

331
00:15:32,925 --> 00:15:33,760
he didn't grow boastful.

332
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,975
Although he's salary is abundant,

333
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,040
he's able to humble down himself.

334
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,280
Hence, I'm promoting such a talented general

335
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,840
with the fate of being a marquis.

336
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,125
I'm especially conferring him

337
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,840
the title Golden Purple Glorious Grand Master,

338
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,080
High State Pillar General,

339
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,120
inheriting the Marquis of Ningyuan title.

340
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,240
His official duty will still be the same.

341
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,320
His wife, Lady Sheng,

342
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,500
is virtuous and gentle in temperament, graceful

343
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,560
and beautiful in appearance,

344
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,325
is pure and fragrant

345
00:15:54,325 --> 00:15:55,425
like a dense growth of osmanthus,

346
00:15:55,425 --> 00:15:56,640
has intelligence like a flowing river.

347
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,875
It has become natural for her

348
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:58,680
to give out benefits.

349
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,900
It is a natural for her

350
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,000
to be benevolent and filial.

351
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,750
She's being especially conferred the title

352
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,760
Lady of Yongjia Commandery.

353
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,200
This decree is to be promulgated.

354
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,225
Marquis, Marquis' Wife,

355
00:16:10,225 --> 00:16:12,120
please thank the His Majesty's graces.

356
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,400
I'm especially grateful

357
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,120
to the graces of His Majesty!

358
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,920
Congratulations Marquis and Marquis' Wife.

359
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,680
I now have a conferred title.

360
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,120
How could I have earned a conferred title?

361
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,160
Why can't you?

362
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,120
But... how old am I just now?

363
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,120
I heard that the deceased Big Madam Qin

364
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,920
only got her conferred title

365
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,080
after she died.

366
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,320
The current Big Madam Qin

367
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,920
had to go through two generations of marquis

368
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,160
before being conferred a title lately.

369
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,160
Even my grandmother doesn't have one.

370
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,600
Because my father didn't save

371
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,520
a voluntary corps commander

372
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,800
while in the wilderness,

373
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,000
and he also didn't fight

374
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,240
and killed enemies inside the palace,

375
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,725
of course, they won't be able

376
00:17:12,725 --> 00:17:13,600
to get a conferred title.

377
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,000
My mother got conferred at title

378
00:17:16,007 --> 00:17:17,280
because of giving birth to me.

379
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,640
You were conferred a title

380
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,760
because you married me.

381
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,920
It was clearly His Majesty's grace.

382
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,400
It was clearly me who went to the palace

383
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,280
to help you get one.

384
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,760
Silly woman.

385
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,480
Marquis. Madam.

386
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,200
People from there have come.

387
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,360
Ye'er,

388
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,480
you're too unfair

389
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,800
towards the Fourth House!

390
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,640
Bin'er has been sickly since he was little.

391
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,560
Your Fourth Aunt-in-law has spoiled him too much

392
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,480
and didn't let him suffer even for a bit.

393
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,600
But you just have to let him get exiled.

394
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,600
It's not me who wants to exile him.

395
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,960
It was His Majesty who exiled him.

396
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,560
Making connections with a rebel prince,

397
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,440
just for that one grave crime,

398
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,520
exiling

399
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,920
is already a light punishment.

400
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,480
How about

401
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,200
we let your Di'er go then?

402
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,240
This... how could you talk like that?

403
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,640
Don't be mad.

404
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,120
Fifth Uncle,

405
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,640
Second son

406
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,400
must have did his best already.

407
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,680
Uncle, stop scolding him.

408
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,200
Ye'er,

409
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,600
now that the Fourth House

410
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,960
is lacking a son now,

411
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,080
they surely will be lacking some support

412
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,040
for the future days.

413
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,040
Ye'er, you must comfort

414
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,120
and take care of them more.

415
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,200
Big Madam Qin,

416
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,775
you're the person

417
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,280
that I can't clearly read the most.

418
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,320
With you being such a good actress,

419
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,520
it's really a waste of talent for you to stay here

420
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,120
in this marquis manor

421
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,600
rather than join the southern opera troupe.

422
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,320
How could he speak like that!

423
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,625
When you disregarded law

424
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:19,360
and natural morality before that

425
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,480
your father had to beat you up,

426
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,960
this mother kept defending you.

427
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,000
How dare you

428
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,160
insult her like this now?!

429
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,800
It's fine. It's fine.

430
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,040
You...

431
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,440
He just have such stinky attitude.

432
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,480
Fifth Uncle,

433
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,040
why do you keep

434
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,240
defending your sister-in-law,

435
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,760
my stepmother?

436
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,400
What's the reason behind this?

437
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,076
This...

438
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,280
Shameless!

439
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,360
You even dared to insult me too?!

440
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,080
Second Brother.

441
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:55,640
Do you still treat us

442
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,800
as your elders?!

443
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,280
Second Brother, what nonsense are you saying?!

444
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,040
I'm so mad!

445
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,600
What?

446
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,760
You're also helping them to scold me here

447
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,440
in my house?

448
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,115
I heard that eldest brother

449
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,200
revealed the matters that the family

450
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,080
did to wrong you.

451
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,880
But my mother— Third!

452
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,640
Looks like Second doesn't plan

453
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,760
to give me any dignity.

454
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,600
Let's go.

455
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,640
Mother.

456
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,240
Sister-in-law! Don't go! Mother-in-law!

457
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,720
Don't cry anymore.

458
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,640
He just have a stinky temper.

459
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,600
Don't put it to heart.

460
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,560
He's deliberately being mean to me.

461
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,360
What sin do I have?

462
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,240
I was totally submissive

463
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,280
in raising such a son!

464
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,840
I won't leave uncle and auntie

465
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,360
for lunch anymore.

466
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,160
Grand Madam!

467
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,240
Husband.

468
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,880
Fifth Uncle!

469
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,520
Husband, don't be mad.

470
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,455
Fifth Uncle!

471
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,480
Fifth Auntie, so sorry.

472
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,360
Husband.

473
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,720
Mother too.

474
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,960
Why must you insist in coming with Fifth Uncle

475
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,840
in this trip to get insulted like that?

476
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,000
Now is great.

477
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,080
Second Brother is mad,

478
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,400
and he refuses to mind me too.

479
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,720
How could I

480
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,320
still expect him

481
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,400
to find me a good job now?

482
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,680
You're placing your hopes on him?

483
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,400
He's your bitter rival!

484
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,280
Although

485
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,320
we did fight before,

486
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:18,920
we're still siblings.

487
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,980
Also, Second Brother dotes me since I was little.

488
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,200
Now,

489
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,120
he's also just mad at you a little.

490
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,640
Good thing,

491
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,360
he's not a petty person.

492
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:26,925
I reckon that his anger

493
00:22:26,925 --> 00:22:27,680
would have dissipated in a few days.

494
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,680
Are you my son?

495
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,560
Get in the carriage!

496
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,440
On our way there,

497
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,150
that Gu Tingye has already

498
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:49,640
inherited the marquis title

499
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,440
and conferred with other more titles.

500
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,225
It was even promulgated by the close eunuch

501
00:22:54,225 --> 00:22:55,080
of His Majesty, Eunuch Li.

502
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,400
How high is the honor being given to him?

503
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,080
That noble title was supposed to be yours.

504
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,280
Have you never thought

505
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,400
of stealing it back?

506
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,840
You even thought of being a lackey

507
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,800
of that Gu Tingye.

508
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,360
Your father and I were both tough people.

509
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,200
How come we end up

510
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,360
having a son like you?

511
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,080
I also want to inherit a noble title,

512
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,880
but I should be qualified to do so.

513
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,160
Second Brother is currently

514
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,000
a favored powerful official

515
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,080
of His Majesty.

516
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,640
Now, he has inherited the title

517
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,720
and isn't a bedridden sickly person

518
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,760
like eldest brother.

519
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,840
Presently, he is at the prime of his manhood,

520
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,720
as strong as a bull.

521
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,575
He and Second Sister-in-law

522
00:23:25,575 --> 00:23:26,280
are also so much in love.

523
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,325
Just looking at it and you know

524
00:23:27,325 --> 00:23:28,040
that they'll have children soon.

525
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,440
It will never be my turn.

526
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,160
What do you mean by favored and powerful?

527
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,600
Do you know the matter

528
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,440
about him getting scolded

529
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,320
by His Majesty?

530
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,000
What?

531
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,320
What's going on?

532
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,800
You don't even know this?

533
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,760
What's the use of you hanging out with those

534
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,800
disreputable friends of yours?

535
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,640
But, Second Brother

536
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,700
is currently a popular

537
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,920
highly favored new official.

538
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,240
How could His Majesty—

539
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,160
What do you mean by highly favored

540
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,080
new official or currently popular?

541
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,960
It means that he wasn't favored before,

542
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,720
but is now.

543
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,040
He wasn't popular before, but is now.

544
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,880
It's not strange

545
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,800
for His Majesty to scold him.

546
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,560
What's weird is

547
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,600
this news

548
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,680
got out so fast.

549
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,560
It means that His Majesty didn't care.

550
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,920
So, if he didn't care,

551
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,440
how could he be a favored one?

552
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,680
Remember this.

553
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,480
There's no such thing as being favored or not.

554
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,325
There is only should be used

555
00:24:13,325 --> 00:24:14,280
or not by the emperor.

556
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,440
Mother,

557
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,120
so what if Second Brother

558
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:17,960
is the head of our house?

559
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,650
In the past, you and him were like

560
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:19,400
a benevolent mother and a filial son,

561
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,800
I also was highly doted and cared for by him.

562
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,040
What's wrong with that!

563
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,440
You really have to torment him?

564
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,320
Fine.

565
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,120
Anyway, it's not only us

566
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,640
who wants him dead.

567
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,040
No need to look for weaknesses.

568
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,000
They will come on their own.

569
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,120
Stop the carriage.

570
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,040
Stop the carriage!

571
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,040
Third Young Master,

572
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,000
Big Madam did all of these

573
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,280
for your sake.

574
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,080
Just continue to instigate my mother.

575
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,440
Third Young Master!

576
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,520
Big Madam.

577
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,360
Today, since we got conferred

578
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,560
positions and titles,

579
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,040
this Big Madam Qin of mine,

580
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,240
oh, wrong.

581
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,560
She has now a conferred title.

582
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,960
I should call her Grand Madam.

583
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,160
Technically speaking,

584
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,400
we still have provide for her.

585
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,640
That Grand Madam Qin

586
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,480
is so cunning and craty.

587
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,520
Usually,

588
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,000
she would act so gentle and kind.

589
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,840
The whole Bianjing is praising her.

590
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,680
But actually, her stomach is fool of teeth.

591
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,560
Right.

592
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,120
I've thought about this matter

593
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,200
that you said.

594
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,240
Don't call me that.

595
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,480
What should I call you?

596
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,680
Second Uncle?

597
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,040
Shut up!

598
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,760
You and I are not related by blood.

599
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,080
Why must you call me Second Uncle

600
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,440
just like Yuanruo?

601
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,600
Why can't you call me

602
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,360
like how your Second Brother calls me?

603
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,520
Or, call me Darling Second.

604
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,200
That's so disrespectful.

605
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,320
It's better to call you husband.

606
00:27:01,396 --> 00:27:03,000
Under that little face of yours,

607
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,760
how are you still respectful towards me?

608
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,040
Quickly, call me Darling Second.

609
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,920
I really know how to deal

610
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,880
with your stepmother.

611
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,840
Don't worry.

612
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,920
Let's break down the walls

613
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,720
between our manors.

614
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,800
Put a garden on that area

615
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,200
and do some more renovations.

616
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,120
On the outside,

617
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,440
it's two families uniting as one.

618
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,680
But in reality, we're living in one,

619
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,520
the two of them,

620
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:25,920
and sister-in-law,

621
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,160
are living in the other manor.

622
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,680
It's still the same as before.

623
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,960
If you are still worried,

624
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,520
I'll ask the carpenter to add

625
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,600
an additional dividing door,

626
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,520
but that will make the travel farther.

627
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:45,978
Call me Darling Second.

628
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,240
Say it one word at a time.

629
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,200
Try it.

630
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,640
Second...

631
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,920
Darling Second!

632
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,240
You call it well.

633
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,400
Is he here?

634
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,920
Not yet.

635
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,720
Where is he?

636
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,680
We've agreed to meet here.

637
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,520
Big Madam has a pious heart.

638
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,120
Buy some incenses.

639
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,760
Incenses are good.

640
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,175
The gods will bless you

641
00:29:26,175 --> 00:29:27,480
and all your wishes will come true.

642
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,200
Go away.

643
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,160
Big Madam, you don't want incenses?

644
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,760
These are good incenses from Yangzhou.

645
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,160
What's your name?

646
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,520
Bai.

647
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,320
I want

648
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,080
to invite Big Madam to meet someone.

649
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,400
If the person is right,

650
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,960
you can then decide to buy my incense

651
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,560
or not.

652
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,800
I can go meet the person,

653
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,880
but I don't want her to see me.

654
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,280
It's really true that only the salt merchants

655
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,200
can find this woman.

656
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,260
We've always sent men

657
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,360
to monitor Gu Tingye.

658
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,840
When this woman entered our territory,

659
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,640
she got invited to live in our manor.

660
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,400
You have really put a lot of efforts in it.

661
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,250
He used his identity as

662
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,320
the legitimate son of a marquis

663
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,280
to steal my family's assets.

664
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,480
I'm not only diligent

665
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,640
in trying to kill him,

666
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,440
I'm diligent in everything that I do.

667
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:48,760
Go.

668
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,720
Eldest of the Bai Family,

669
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,400
just wait for our good news.

670
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,360
I will

671
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,880
quietly wait here for your good news then.

672
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,610
Okay already.

673
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:26,210
Go now.

674
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,880
Tingye, going to the morning court meeting?!

675
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,680
I'm also going to pray to Buddha.

676
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,080
Let's travel together!

677
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,600
Shitou.

678
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,400
Let's go.

679
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,080
Okay.

680
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,800
Mother-in-law, hope you are well.

681
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,040
I am well.

682
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,280
Second! Second!

683
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,600
Even if you don't acknowledge me,

684
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,320
you shouldn't kill me!

685
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,840
Second!

686
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,075
For you refusing to acknowledge me

687
00:32:17,075 --> 00:32:18,120
and wanting to kill me,

688
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,320
I accept my fate.

689
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,440
But...

690
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,280
you can't refuse to acknowledge your son!

691
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,200
What's going on here?

692
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,560
Second...

693
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,000
This...

694
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,600
Second!

695
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,720
Isn't this that

696
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,920
outside mistress of Second?

697
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,480
Second!

698
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,800
You are also an educated and well behaved person.

699
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,960
You should know

700
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,200
about this thing.

701
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,360
You must increase your tolerance.

702
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,360
Why is Buddha's abdomen

703
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,560
so huge?

704
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,750
That is because he can

705
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,880
tolerate people and matters.

706
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,960
Mother-in-law, what are you saying?

707
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,720
This little temple of our can't accommodate

708
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,320
such a huge Buddha.

709
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,520
Good child.

710
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,920
Don't get yourself a jealous wife reputation

711
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,760
at such a young age.

712
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,920
She came from a poor family,

713
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,960
and has not much foundation.

714
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,440
Isn't it still you

715
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,560
who has the final say?

716
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,840
Just let her into your house.

717
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,800
Oh, right.

718
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,760
Doesn't she still have a child

719
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,880
who is taking care by you?

720
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,440
Go!

721
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,120
Call the Miss to see her birth mother!

722
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,080
That child is also quite pitiful.

723
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,400
When father-in-law was alive,

724
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,575
he was resolute to not let her

725
00:33:52,575 --> 00:33:53,240
into the House of Gu.

726
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,480
The whole capital knows about this.

727
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,920
Father-in-law has just died not long ago.

728
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:58,960
Mother-in-law,

729
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,280
have you forgotten about it?

730
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,720
She gave birth to a son, hence,

731
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,800
provided merit to our Gu Family.

732
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,400
What mother-in-law said is very reasonable.

733
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,480
Madam Zhu,

734
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,560
go call Chang'er

735
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,000
and just let me raise him.

736
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,800
I've never imagined in my wildest dreams

737
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,000
that the main wife of Darling Gu

738
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,040
will be you.

739
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,800
At the Yu Manor before,

740
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,500
you scolded and ridiculed me

741
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,560
in behalf of Eldest Miss Yu.

742
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,320
Could it be because you have selfish intentions

743
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,800
of having Darling Gu to yourself?

744
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,920
I'm not as smart as you.

745
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,320
I fully listen to my family

746
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,240
when it comes to marriage matters.

747
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,880
Whoever my family tells me to marry,

748
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,920
I will marry that man.

749
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,640
How can there be so many considerations?

750
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,640
There is still such a matter?

751
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,480
This is my family business.

752
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,000
If you have nothing else to do,

753
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,600
you can go to the temple to light incenses.

754
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,920
See if Bodhisattva will bless you

755
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,480
that all your wishes will come true.

756
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,200
Shitou!

757
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:15,800
Here!

758
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,600
Escort the guest out!

759
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,280
Yes!

760
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,880
Please go this way.

761
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,480
Yes, this is your family matter.

762
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,000
Ye'er, don't forget.

763
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,325
Our dynasty governs

764
00:35:38,325 --> 00:35:39,920
through benevolence and righteousness.

765
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,480
You are also a high official of this government.

766
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,480
It's better not to escalate this matter

767
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,720
too much.

768
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:57,760
Darling Gu!

769
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,400
Don't you want

770
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,720
our child anymore?

771
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,320
Where is Chang'er?

772
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,200
If you allow me to enter your house,

773
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,600
place my name in your family's genealogy,

774
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,960
he naturally can see you already.

775
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,040
The only way that can work now

776
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,920
is to pretend to comply.

777
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,560
Falsely agree in letting her into the house.

778
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,400
Once Chang'er appears,

779
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,120
it will be easy to do the other things.

780
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,960
I think that Madam Zhu

781
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,880
is very scheming.

782
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,000
She's not that easy to deal with.

783
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,880
The condition she requested now

784
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,760
is for you to sleep with her for a night.

785
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:04,720
In the future,

786
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:05,680
don't know what other conditions

787
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,760
she'll come up with.

788
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,360
Must we agree with them all the time?

789
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,680
You...

790
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:16,920
What about me?

791
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,700
Other than weighing the pros and cons,

792
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,480
and thinking of a plan,

793
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,720
do you have other things

794
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,400
to tell me?

795
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,160
I do.

796
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,640
The conditions she's asking now

797
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,560
are still easy to comply with.

798
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,520
But if in the future,

799
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,640
we meet a condition that you can't agree to,

800
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,640
what should we do then?

801
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,080
Easy to comply?

802
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,425
You feel that spending a night

803
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,200
with a woman in one room

804
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,280
is easy to comply with?

805
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:46,960
I know that you think her heart is

806
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,280
like a serpent and scorpion, hence,

807
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,640
you don't want to agree.

808
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,440
But she...

809
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,920
refuses to reveal the whereabouts

810
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,000
of Chang'er no matter what.

811
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,960
You... if you stay with her for a night,

812
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,600
maybe,

813
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,720
you'll be able to get some information from her.

814
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,760
Easy to comply with?

815
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,120
You even felt that it's easy to comply with?!

816
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,800
That is your son,

817
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,880
not mine.

818
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,360
Why are you venting your anger on me?

819
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,120
Darling Gu,

820
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,960
she finally let you come here.

821
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Quickly leave.

822
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,200
Sit down.

823
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,280
How has your life been

824
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,720
since you left?

825
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,120
Don't know how much sufferings

826
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,320
I've endured throughout our journey.

827
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,880
These are scars left by me

828
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,400
washing clothes and doing sewing works

829
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,480
for others.

830
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,560
I would then think...

831
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,560
It's all my fault for making such wrong decisions.

832
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,080
I caused you to dislike me.

833
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,160
Just treat this as my retribution.

834
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,200
When you left, you took away quite a lot of money.

835
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,480
Why must you still wash clothes and do needlework?

836
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,640
I've told you that my older brother

837
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,960
is a scoundrel,

838
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,080
but you wouldn't believe me.

839
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,640
He plundered my money.

840
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,280
He would go to brothels and gamble.

841
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,680
As if I have an abyss-like amount of money.

842
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,800
In a few days, they've all been spent.

843
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,240
Chang'er is also just a child.

844
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,680
He lives like a prince at home,

845
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,840
not needing to worry about food or clothes.

846
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,240
Just to provide for him,

847
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,240
I'm willing to do any job.

848
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,440
I'm willing to endure any hardship.

849
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:48,840
Come on.

850
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,640
Chang'er is still a child.

851
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,320
He indeed shouldn't suffer.

852
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,800
In a few days,

853
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,160
just move him into my house,

854
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,000
won't that be better?

855
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,880
Darling Gu, you've already decided on

856
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,280
the date of our marriage?

857
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,320
The day after tomorrow.

858
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,600
The day after tomorrow is an auspicious day.

859
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,600
If you don't find it too hasty,

860
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,880
we'll set it on the day after tomorrow.

861
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,400
I don't mind. I don't mind.

862
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,280
Chang'er is still little.

863
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,600
I'm thinking of

864
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,325
sending someone to fetch him,

865
00:41:41,325 --> 00:41:42,320
so he could watch our wedding.

866
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,440
Why must he come?

867
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,640
Once my name

868
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,400
has entered the genealogy of the House of Gu,

869
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,280
he can come anytime.

870
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:02,925
Once you entered my house

871
00:42:02,925 --> 00:42:03,640
on the day after tomorrow,

872
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,000
I'll invite the elders

873
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,360
of our Gu Clan

874
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,240
to write your name

875
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,320
on our genealogy book.

876
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,640
It's just I don't know if...

877
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
two days is enough to fetch Chang'er

878
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,680
to come here.

879
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,520
He won't be able to come.

880
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,225
No matter how many days more,

881
00:42:23,225 --> 00:42:24,080
he won't be able to come.

882
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,720
If I don't see my name being entered

883
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,680
into the genealogy book of the Gu Clan,

884
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,000
I will not talk.

885
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,240
Darling Gu,

886
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,720
it's getting late.

887
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,320
Let's go settle down.

888
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,480
You used to be very submissive to me.

889
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,100
Now, you would block

890
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,140
every question I ask.

891
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,360
Why must I still take you in as a concubine?

892
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,520
Darling Gu, don't be mad.

893
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,240
I only ask to enter your house as a concubine.

894
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,000
Once I enter,

895
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,920
I surely will be submissive to you.

896
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,200
You're treating me like this

897
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,240
when you haven't entered my house yet.

898
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,920
Once you've entered,

899
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,560
won't you be climbing up my head?!

900
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,680
Fine. Fine.

901
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,150
I'll tell them that

902
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:28,830
there will be no joyous event

903
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,200
on the day after tomorrow.

904
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,040
It's better to just keep those almanacs

905
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,000
and red ribbons away.

906
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,000
Darling Gu!

907
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,400
Darling Gu!

908
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,320
What?

909
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,240
You want to talk now?

910
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,160
I'll talk.

911
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,760
Come nearer to me.

912
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,480
You bastard!

913
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,320
Men!

914
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,520
Young Master!

915
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,800
You still want your son?

916
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,225
Chang'er is already dead!

917
00:44:15,225 --> 00:44:16,680
He already dead for so long!

918
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:17,760
You're lying!

919
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,920
The grasses on top of his tomb

920
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,880
is already three meters high!

921
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,600
Tie her up!

922
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,280
Take her away!

923
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,680
He's already dead!

924
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,160
He's already dead!

925
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,560
You still want your son?
