00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,788
Episode 65

3
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,475
The Kang woman

4
00:01:06,475 --> 00:01:08,920
kept instigating and sowing discord among our family.

5
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,320
But who doesn't know

6
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,080
about the character of Big Madam?

7
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,568
Grandmother usually

8
00:01:15,568 --> 00:01:16,400
just pretended to be deaf and dumb.

9
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,640
She sometimes might say a few words, but that's it.

10
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,520
But, since she stuffed a concubine here,

11
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,080
it has agitated and angered grandmother.

12
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,520
She scolded her, took away her rights

13
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,720
and even punished her

14
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,965
by making her kneel at a place

15
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:32,080
where people are moving about.

16
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,360
But the Big Madam

17
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,200
has been so competitive all her life.

18
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,560
If she could have just submitted a little,

19
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,510
that Lin woman would have been nothing

20
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,360
in my father's eyes long time ago.

21
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,450
It was really too cruel for Big Madam.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That's why the evil woman found an opportunity.

23
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,120
No matter what,

24
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,240
she already has

25
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,680
a daughter-in-law and a grandchild.

26
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,400
She should be given appropriate respect,

27
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,400
at least.

28
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,000
Actually, if you're going to return to the root of everything,

29
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,200
I was the reason why

30
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,200
grandmother's life was endangered.

31
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,760
It was because she was too worried about me.

32
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,240
She always thinks for my sake.

33
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,200
At her age,

34
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,980
she should be enjoying the blessings

35
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,600
from her children and grandchildren.

36
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,350
She should be living her life comfortably.

37
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,840
and shouldn't be worrying anymore.

38
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,280
But at her age,

39
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,720
she still has to suffer so much.

40
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,400
As her granddaughter,

41
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,440
my heart really aches for her.

42
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,560
I understand.

43
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,720
You have me.

44
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,000
You have me.

45
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,360
Don't worry.

46
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,880
Grandmother loves me so much.

47
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,120
I feel so bad.

48
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,120
Miss,

49
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,400
Second Miss,

50
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,160
my good Miss,

51
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,520
you've been crying all day.

52
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,320
If you continue to cry, your eyes will get damaged.

53
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,280
I must cry for 10 years.

54
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,920
He wants me to go there for 10 years.

55
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,760
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

56
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,200
Why doesn't he just kill me now?

57
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,080
Miss.

58
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,360
That vile spawn,

59
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,347
I've carried him in my womb for 10 months

60
00:04:16,347 --> 00:04:17,160
before giving birth to him.

61
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,800
He is heartless.

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,200
He only cares about the person in Shou'an Hall.

63
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,775
Was it the Old Madam who gave birth to him?

64
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,600
Miss,

65
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,360
you are not like the Madam Kang,

66
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,200
who can just walk away.

67
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,160
Once the Old Madam recovers,

68
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,240
you still have to

69
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,280
attend by her side.

70
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,120
From now on,

71
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,000
no matter what the Old Madam says or does,

72
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,800
you must accept it graciously.

73
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,600
Hence,

74
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,960
why not just get punished cruelly?

75
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,840
Once you return after several years,

76
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,760
the matter has happened long ago,

77
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,520
you've admitted your mistake and been punished,

78
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,320
everything then will be flattened out.

79
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,480
After committing such a huge sin,

80
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,240
can it really be smoothed out?

81
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,000
I can see that the Old Madam

82
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,800
doesn't have a hard heart.

83
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,360
Also,

84
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,880
as long as you've been punished,

85
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,320
Master and Young Master Bai

86
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,600
will also be at ease.

87
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,960
Moreover,

88
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,200
we can't really let Young Master Bai resign, right?

89
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,680
Just let him resign if he wants to!

90
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,880
He dares to use that to threaten me?

91
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,120
You mustn't say it like that.

92
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,320
Young Master Bai is

93
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,880
highly favored by the emperor.

94
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,560
Not only you,

95
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,800
even Master and the House of Wang

96
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,480
are relying on him.

97
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,720
Didn't you see that

98
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,200
when he said that he would resign,

99
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,725
even Old Madam Wang panicked.

100
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,120
Furthermore,

101
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,400
are you hoping that

102
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,360
Changfeng can be an official?

103
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,280
Once he gets promoted,

104
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,280
he might get a conferred title for that

105
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,520
lowly bitch Mistress Lin.

106
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,440
That bitch

107
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,840
She aren't qualified

108
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,920
even if she's six feet under.

109
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,600
That's right!

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,920
It's good that you understand.

111
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,160
Let's go back to Youyang

112
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,880
and nurse your health.

113
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,835
As long as Young Master Bai's

114
00:06:06,835 --> 00:06:08,200
official career goes smoothly

115
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,920
and have a promising future,

116
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,240
who would dare to slight you in our old house ?

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,640
If your Eldest Sister-in-law

118
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,400
really treats you badly

119
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,720
for old grievances against you,

120
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,880
just ask her then,

121
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,040
"How many sons and daughters do you have

122
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,275
that are as successful as mine?"

123
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,400
But once I go there,

124
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,120
I will be at an unfamiliar place, among unfamiliar people.

125
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,280
It will just be me myself.

126
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,040
My god.

127
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,120
I'll accompany you!

128
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,160
How can that be?

129
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,320
You're such a honorable steward maidservant.

130
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,040
How could you get used

131
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,760
to living in the province?

132
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,600
Why wouldn't a crude person like me

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,160
get used to it?

134
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,160
All my children have their own families now.

135
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,720
They can live without me.

136
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,000
My husband

137
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,960
is managing the farmstead for you.

138
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,304
I'll then accompany you

139
00:07:06,304 --> 00:07:07,840
to recite sutra and pray to the deities.

140
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,480
Moreover,

141
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,720
how could a good Big Madam like you

142
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,250
not have a loyal lackey like me?

143
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,280
My heart really have been covered by pig's oil

144
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,960
and my eyes were blinded.

145
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,760
Every words you told me before

146
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,040
were good advice.

147
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,760
I actually didn't listen to them.

148
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,240
Since at the House of Wang, I've accompanied you.

149
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,640
Until you got married here and became the Big Madam.

150
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,200
It's been decades.

151
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,200
Big Madam,

152
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,300
don't cry anymore.

153
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,920
Let's go outside and take a stroll to relax your mind.

154
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,800
Look! How good the weather is.

155
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,840
Let's go.

156
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,640
Marquis,

157
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,600
Are you done with the salt taxation matters?

158
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,560
You finally have thought about that.

159
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,760
Could it be that you returned to the capital without permission?

160
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,080
Your brother received

161
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,040
a letter from your sister-in-law.

162
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,520
After reading just two lines, he went to look for me.

163
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,880
Only then did I know that

164
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,040
a huge matter had happened to your family.

165
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,800
You,

166
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,320
and my older brother came back without permission?!

167
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,160
If this gets out,

168
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,240
it will be a grave crime!

169
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,320
You're anxious?

170
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,880
Of course, I'm worried about you!

171
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,320
Fortunately, the House of Wang got in trouble now.

172
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,320
No one would dare to spread this matter.

173
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,360
If people knew that

174
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,200
you returned to the capital without permission,

175
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,000
it will be hard to cover up this thing.

176
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,680
No need to worry.

177
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,800
I'm a capable man.

178
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,440
Before we left,

179
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,800
we've already informed Prince Huan.

180
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,240
Even if His Majesty learns of this,

181
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,840
at most, he'll just scold me.

182
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,880
It's fine.

183
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,880
I learned that something bad happened to the family.

184
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,920
I learned that something bad happened to you.

185
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,320
I so wanted to put on wings

186
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,120
and fly back here!

187
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,880
I couldn't care about that much anymore.

188
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,880
I've caused you trouble.

189
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,240
On my way back here,

190
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,400
I kept thinking about one problem.

191
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,200
How come your sister-in-law

192
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,440
knew to write to your older brother,

193
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,200
while you never thought of writing to me

194
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,920
when such a huge incident happened to your family?

195
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,760
This matter happened too sudden

196
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,120
and too fast.

197
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,960
I didn't think that much.

198
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,240
No.

199
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,000
It's because you don't trust me at all.

200
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,360
You don't believe

201
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,080
that I'll rush back just for this matter.

202
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,640
You don't believe that I'll defend you.

203
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,520
Moreover, you don't believe that

204
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,200
I will risk everything to protect you

205
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,680
after such a huge matter happened to you.

206
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,960
Yes, I don't trust you.

207
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,175
I can risk my future,

208
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,080
but I can't

209
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,000
risk yours.

210
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,080
How come your sister-in-law

211
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,000
risked the future of

212
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,880
your older brother?

213
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,200
Because she never treated

214
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,040
your older brother as an outsider.

215
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,960
She didn't worry about this or that.

216
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,600
She didn't think about things carefully.

217
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,240
And she wasn't too cautious.

218
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,280
Minglan,

219
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,360
aren't you being such a stranger with me?

220
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,600
You are different from my older brother.

221
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,560
He has enjoyed the favor of so many people.

222
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,640
It has always been smooth sailing

223
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,880
in everything that he did.

224
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,360
What about you?

225
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,720
It's not easy for you

226
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,280
to finally live some peaceful and stable life,

227
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,680
and establish a good official career.

228
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,560
How could I

229
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,400
just watch you

230
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,080
Isn't it enough that

231
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,880
you think of me and I think of you?

232
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,240
Of course, it's enough.

233
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,360
But I'm still a bit greedy.

234
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,320
Have you ever been

235
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,520
very annoyed by me?

236
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,440
Have you ever hated me so much?

237
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,960
Hated me to the point that you want to bite me?

238
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,960
Can the two of us have a fight?

239
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,200
Be like that

240
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,880
legitimate mother of yours,

241
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,840
make a scene and roll about.

242
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,680
Let's give it a try, okay?

243
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,560
I don't understand you.

244
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,600
I really don't.

245
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,960
Is that how that Prostitute Wei

246
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,960
treated you?

247
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,880
What Prostitute Wei?

248
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,160
How come you're involving

249
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:55,920
her here?

250
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,280
Did your scoundrel older brother

251
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,240
told you something?

252
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,080
I almost got derailed by you.

253
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,720
That, you,

254
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,880
and my older brother,

255
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,720
don't go casually moving

256
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,640
around in the daytime.

257
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,840
Once it's night fall, you immediately leave the city.

258
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:15,920
It's too late.

259
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,760
Last night,

260
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,200
after that Kang got caned,

261
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,400
Old Madam Wang

262
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,240
saw blood and pitied her daughter.

263
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,000
She refused to sign the papers for her imprisonment.

264
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,000
Cousin Kang

265
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,560
and your older brother got physical

266
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,680
and were dragged away.

267
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,040
This morning,

268
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,920
Zecheng especially went to the House of Wang

269
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,000
to get Old Madam Wang to sign.

270
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,160
But, he's a very cautious man.

271
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,240
He probably won't leak this matter out.

272
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,320
That older brother of mine

273
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,880
is so stubborn.

274
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,680
How about

275
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,960
let me talk to the House of Kang.

276
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:53,920
No!

277
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,240
You mustn't go there!

278
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,600
If anyone will go, it should be me.

279
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,080
Even if

280
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,040
I have to threaten Lord Kang with a knife on his neck,

281
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,400
I'll get you that signature.

282
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,040
With your body now,

283
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,200
what if things get physical

284
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,120
while you're in the House of Kang,

285
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,480
won't that just agitate me?

286
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,760
Don't get agitated.

287
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,040
I won't go talk to the House of Kang.

288
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,920
I'll talk to my father.

289
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,080
Father-in-law?

290
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,200
For a slick person like Father-in-law,

291
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,880
he will go to Lord Kang?

292
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,320
He won't.

293
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,240
Tell me,

294
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,200
what does that Prostitute Wei look like?

295
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,160
How would I know?

296
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,440
We should ask men about that.

297
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,680
Book her next time

298
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,080
and we'll be able to see her.

299
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,400
Big Madam, are you for real?

300
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,920
No.

301
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,920
Sir Second Tu works for the marquis.

302
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,960
However you look at it,

303
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,760
all males that we know

304
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,040
are connected with my marquis.

305
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,200
Should we then look for an outsider steward?

306
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:57,920
No.

307
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,840
We can't fully trust them.

308
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,600
Maybe, we'll be giving others our weakness.

309
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,760
Why don't

310
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,080
we go to Old Madam to get some ideas?

311
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,440
You think I'm stupid.

312
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,080
Do you want me

313
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,040
to get punished by grandmother?

314
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,160
I just feel that

315
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,320
with Old Madam's personality,

316
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,600
she might not hit you,

317
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,120
and even laugh her head off

318
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,120
and book for you.

319
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,280
I remember it now.

320
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,640
Madam Yu

321
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,280
once taught Prostitute Wei how to sew.

322
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,320
That's right.

323
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,880
I can write to Sister Yanran.

324
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,400
She surely will laugh at me.

325
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,880
Big Madam, go in and take your time chatting.

326
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,960
I'll just wait here outside.

327
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,160
You clean up the mess

328
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,280
that you've created.

329
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,320
I won't go to the House of Kang for you.

330
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,680
For a good excuse of attempted murder to divorce his wife,

331
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,760
I think that maternal uncle-in-law of yours

332
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,000
might be lighting firecrackers

333
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,840
in his house.

334
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,560
How would then he sign those papers

335
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,320
for her imprisonment

336
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,280
as her husband?

337
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,200
You must know

338
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,760
that once she gets in,

339
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,840
he won't be able to divorce her.

340
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,520
In Maternal Uncle-in-law's harem,

341
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,880
there's a Concubine Jin.

342
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,360
She's really skilled.

343
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,480
Not only does she have sons and daughters,

344
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,600
she hasn't lost favor for decades.

345
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,760
This is a problem concerning their main madam.

346
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,160
What does a concubine have to do with it?

347
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,920
Father, you said it very wrongly.

348
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,560
No matter if Maternal Aunt gets divorced

349
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,520
or sentenced to death,

350
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,320
Maternal Uncle's main wife will be empty

351
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,320
and he surely will remarry.

352
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,960
If he marries someone young and beautiful,

353
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,640
how would that Concubine Jin

354
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,640
place herself?

355
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,720
What the concubine wants to see the most

356
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,880
is your Maternal Aunt, the main wife,

357
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,040
maintain her status only by name.

358
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Not only will this stop any new wives

359
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,960
from entering the house,

360
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,680
but also can she be the steward of the household,

361
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,880
and her children would be receiving a lot of blessings.

362
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,040
That's right.

363
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,560
Sending Maternal Aunt to the palace prison

364
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,480
won't really need to

365
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,840
noisily inform everyone about it.

366
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,400
We can just say that she went to the farmstead to recuperate.

367
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,160
This can preserve the reputation of the three families.

368
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,040
Impossible.

369
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,360
Your Maternal Uncle-in-law will never

370
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,760
listen to the words of a concubine.

371
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,382
Not only can that Concubine Jin

372
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:23,360
instigate while the two of them are lying in bed,

373
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,320
she also have grudges.

374
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,200
She only has one daughter,

375
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:29,960
yet it got sent

376
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,760
to Old Master Kang's side

377
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,720
as a concubine.

378
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,080
Really?

379
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,200
Yes.

380
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,338
Isn't Maternal Auntie Kang

381
00:16:37,338 --> 00:16:38,040
just bringing retribution to herself?

382
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,712
Now that her walls have toppled,

383
00:16:39,712 --> 00:16:40,920
it's just natural for everyone to push it further.

384
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,400
Old Master Kang is already over 70 years old.

385
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,400
Father.

386
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,560
You must tell Maternal Uncle-in-law

387
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,480
that because the House of Wang

388
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,320
insists on saving Maternal Aunt,

389
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,680
and because you are considerate about your mother-in-law,

390
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,400
you're almost convinced by them.

391
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,080
Me?

392
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,000
If I get convinced,

393
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,680
then this matter

394
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,680
will get suppressed,

395
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,160
and he won't get to divorce his wife.

396
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,640
That's right.

397
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,080
Either he'll have an innocent

398
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,360
Maternal Aunt going home

399
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,840
and she'll be immensely proud of herself,

400
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,800
or he can just sign the papers

401
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,320
and send that evil wife of his into the palace prison.

402
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,080
What do you think will Maternal Uncle-in-law choose?

403
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,360
Do you need to ask?

404
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,040
How come you've calculated it so thoroughly?

405
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,240
I caused this ruckus

406
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,720
not really for myself,

407
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,720
and not only for grandmother,

408
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,120
it's for our Sheng Family.

409
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,320
Okay.

410
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,840
If you say that it is, then it is.

411
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,360
This matter must get resolved now,

412
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,960
we are the one at the right here.

413
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,760
If we delay it,

414
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,400
father you might end up with an infamous reputation of

415
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,760
neglecting your legitimate mother

416
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,640
and is ungrateful.

417
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,800
It's good that we've disputed this matter now.

418
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,720
Or else, once grandmother reaches her 100th birthday,

419
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,680
others might use this matter to create an issue.

420
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,520
Even if we don't die,

421
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,560
we'll be smelling like mutton.

422
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,760
Other people?

423
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,440
What do they know?

424
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,040
They don't know now,

425
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,080
but what about in the future?

426
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,560
What if it's someone bearing grudges against our family?

427
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,840
When the flowers are in full bloom and the moon is full,

428
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,200
no one would mention it.

429
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,080
But what if one day

430
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,680
the Sheng’s also gets into a juncture,

431
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,840
with such a good weakness to use against us,

432
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,480
why won't they

433
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,880
stab us

434
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,040
during the most critical time?

435
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,840
How come you know

436
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,640
so much about the Kang Manor?

437
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,360
I still know a lot more.

438
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,880
Recently,

439
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,640
I've been thinking about one thing.

440
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,040
How did my well-behaved daughter

441
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,680
become like this?

442
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,600
Shouting for people to be beaten or killed,

443
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,000
but not blinking a bit.

444
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,480
I suddenly figured it out.

445
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,000
You didn't become like this.

446
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,760
You have always been like this.

447
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,400
You were really good in pretending otherwise.

448
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,520
Father.

449
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,240
I never bore any grudge

450
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,040
against you because of your ungenerous treatment.

451
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,640
I also didn't distance myself

452
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,440
from you just because you treated me coldly.

453
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,000
I feel that

454
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:34,840
you should be satisfied already

455
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,320
that I was able to do so.

456
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,840
It's because of your indulging,

457
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,160
that my birth mother

458
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,400
got killed.

459
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,800
I'm a person

460
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,360
who remembers forever

461
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,000
the good things done to me.

462
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,720
Even if I have to risk my life,

463
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,920
I will repay them.

464
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,720
But father,

465
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,600
do you still remember my birth mother?

466
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,920
How old would she be

467
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,240
if she is still alive now?

468
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,360
When was her birthday?

469
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,920
What color did she love?

470
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,800
What food was her favorite?

471
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,760
That time,

472
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,960
I was very busy.

473
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,040
But I remember.

474
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,840
Not only do I remember hers.

475
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,760
I also remember yours.

476
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,480
I know you

477
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,560
more than yourself.

478
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,280
I understand that you put

479
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,800
importance on this family's prosperity and decline.

480
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,520
I understand why

481
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,640
you don't care about the internal fights in your house.

482
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,000
I understand your talent, ability,

483
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,320
pretenses, and coldness.

484
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,720
The more I understand that you are fickle

485
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,400
and easily wavered.

486
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,040
Only the most core interest

487
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,280
can move you.

488
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:13,920
Father,

489
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,280
our family

490
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,440
should just continue to

491
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,680
live our days in a muddled manner.

492
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,240
Why ask so much?

493
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,360
That Madam Kang being kept in our house to recuperate

494
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,720
would eventually be a burden to us.

495
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,200
She must be tightly guarded.

496
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,120
Leave no room for slacking off.

497
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,200
In my opinion,

498
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,280
it's better that she get sent to the palace prison

499
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,880
as soon as possible.

500
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,200
But, she's currently injured.

501
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,680
If we send her to the prison, she will die.

502
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,040
The House of Wang and us

503
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,520
will then have animosity between us.

504
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,680
Sixth.

505
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,200
Sixth,

506
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,560
you must be tired.

507
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,760
If you are, then just go back and rest.

508
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,680
Don't force yourself.

509
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,560
It's not good for your health.

510
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,280
Grandmother,

511
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,600
have you ever seen

512
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,760
the prostitutes here

513
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,600
in Bianjing?

514
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,800
It's fine.

515
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,680
This is very hot.

516
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,200
Your husband and Second Brother

517
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,560
mustn't stay in their houses anymore.

518
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,380
Their official duties haven't been done yet

519
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,000
and they were not decreed to come back.

520
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,360
They privately returned to the capital

521
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,720
and even brought a small troop with them.

522
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,414
No matter who submits a memorial about this,

523
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,240
it is a grave matter.

524
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,120
Right. Right.

525
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,600
What grandmother said is right.

526
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,680
The matter has been resolved.

527
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,480
Father has already obtained the signed letter

528
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,440
from the House of Kang.

529
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,560
Second Brother has also obtained

530
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,480
the signed letter from the House of Wang.

531
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,360
I'll have them leave

532
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,320
by chou hour tomorrow.

533
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,160
No, not chou hour.

534
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,200
That's so late in the night.

535
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,960
There are not many people in the streets by then.

536
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,000
There are 7 to 8 of them travelling,

537
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,560
and all are buff men.

538
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,282
Even if the guards in the city wall

539
00:24:04,282 --> 00:24:06,160
won't recognize them,

540
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,920
it will leave an impression.

541
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,200
Yes.

542
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,560
You said it right.

543
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,640
I'll let them go when the sky turns dark.

544
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,840
There are a lot of people leaving the capital.

545
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,200
Go back now!

546
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,640
The more I think of it, the more I believe it was you.

547
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,560
Did you mention about Prostitute Wei

548
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,520
to my wife?

549
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,760
For so many years,

550
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,640
The relationship between Prostitute Wei and me

551
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,560
has been clean

552
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,400
You know that.

553
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,840
Why must you mention her

554
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,680
to my wife?!

555
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,120
You're causing our family to be in turmoil.

556
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,360
Don't you want her to get anxious?

557
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,120
Now, she is.

558
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,480
She surely will be asking around about her.

559
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,200
That's exactly what you wished, right?

560
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,600
Sheng Changbai,

561
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,120
you can't take it if my life is going great?

562
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,800
If your little sister fights with me about this,

563
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,000
I won't forgive you!

564
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,000
I heard that Prostitute Wei is skilled in writing short poems

565
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,320
and singing.

566
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,085
She stunned the capital

567
00:25:24,085 --> 00:25:25,120
with her rendition of the Wulingchun.

568
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,640
She can even write lyrics.

569
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,120
Really?

570
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:30,907
Everyone is saying that

571
00:25:30,907 --> 00:25:31,960
she has a gentle and refined personality,

572
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:32,960
and is able to clearly understand a person's heart.

573
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,760
No matter what problem you have,

574
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,480
if you go to her,

575
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,520
you'll feel more calm and stable.

576
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,680
How did you know all these?

577
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,080
I asked the guards

578
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,240
this morning.

579
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,000
If you told the guards,

580
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:52,920
then won't

581
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,040
my marquis husband knows?

582
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,240
He will know it eventually.

583
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,840
The group of Marquis Gu and Lord Sheng

584
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,760
have left the capital.

585
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,720
It seems they're heading south

586
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,880
towards Prince Huan.

587
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,600
They haven't finished with their official tasks,

588
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,720
yet they came

589
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,680
and went so fast.

590
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,350
Not only did they return to the capital

591
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:29,800
without being summoned,

592
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,960
they even brought a small troop.

593
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,560
Was it a troop?

594
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,400
Yes.

595
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,520
7 to 8 in their group.

596
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,600
All are good fighters.

597
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,000
Just coming and going like that.

598
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,640
Totally no respect for the law.

599
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,320
Marquis Gu is indeed a bit arrogant.

600
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,600
Your Majesty, don't be mad.

601
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,880
That scoundrel,

602
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,760
he's too savage!

603
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,480
Your Majesty,

604
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,120
don't be mad anymore.

605
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,920
Be careful of your headache acting up again.

606
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,960
Okay already. You go back first.

607
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,160
That crazy woman in the back courtyard

608
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,800
Always cursing and shouting all day,

609
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,680
like some pig or dog.

610
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,320
Causing us to have to deliver

611
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,920
her food despite the already tiring work here.

612
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,840
She would even scold me too.

613
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,920
This is really such a degrading task.

614
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,200
How about this? You are old, hence, precious.

615
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,200
I'll do all the hard labor.

616
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,960
Fine. Fine.

617
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,920
You do it.

618
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,040
You

619
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,080
You dare let me

620
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,200
eat food that even dogs or pigs

621
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,080
won't eat?!

622
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,120
If you throw your food again,

623
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,600
you won't have anything to eat today,

624
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,880
tomorrow,

625
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,280
and the day after.

626
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,240
Big Madam,

627
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,960
you think about it by yourself.

628
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,560
My father has served three emperors.

629
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,040
His memorial tablet is being worshiped in the royal ancestral hall.

630
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,680
You people dare to trample on me like this?

631
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,360
You actually eat food like that?

632
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,040
I think your leg injury

633
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,160
has recovered almost completely.

634
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,920
In just two days, you're going to the palace prison.

635
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,520
By then,

636
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,200
not only will you not see white rice,

637
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,760
you can only eat rice bran.

638
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,520
Thank you.

639
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,520
Be careful!

640
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,440
Be careful of the dung!

641
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,280
I will never go to prison!

642
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,440
Sheng Minglan, you little bitch!

643
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,275
My father is an official who served three emperors

644
00:30:51,275 --> 00:30:51,720
and his memorial tablet

645
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
is being worshiped in the royal ancestral hall.

646
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,160
I will never go there!

647
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,280
That bitch Maternal Aunt Kang

648
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,560
dared to poison grandmother!

649
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,600
Hacking her numerous times isn't too much punishment.

650
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,040
But how come we

651
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,000
didn't know?

652
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,280
This is also not something to be proud of.

653
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,280
It was father and Second Brother

654
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,640
who made the judgement.

655
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,200
We've hidden it to as many people as we can.

656
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,840
Even Third Brother

657
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,080
doesn't know it still.

658
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,120
Indeed.

659
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,880
It was also when Nanny Liu

660
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,600
was sent by mother to us

661
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,480
did we know about this.

662
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,080
That evil woman Maternal Aunt Kang,

663
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:35,920
I so want to

664
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,200
beat her up right now.

665
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,800
Talking about hitting and killing people,

666
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,000
you're even pregnant.

667
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,400
I think

668
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,360
I'll be giving birth soon

669
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,520
in the next few days.

670
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,040
Sixth Little Sister,

671
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,520
wasn't mother

672
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,760
punished too heavily?

673
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,080
I'm giving birth soon.

674
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,040
If she's not around,

675
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,840
I'm a bit scared.

676
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,120
Can mother

677
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,840
delay going to Youyang by a few days?

678
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,000
Fifth Older Sister,

679
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,520
you should be telling this to Second Brother.

680
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,200
It was him who decided on

681
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,720
Big Madam's matter.

682
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,880
Even father dare not say any word.

683
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,320
Why don't you

684
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,520
talk to Second Brother on my behalf?

685
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,520
You're the youngest in the family

686
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,040
and Second Brother's favorite.

687
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,720
Second is close with Marquis.

688
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,920
He surely will give him considerations,

689
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,880
right?

690
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,520
You're right too.

691
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,800
Why don't

692
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,720
I ask grandmother first?

693
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,640
She's after all the victim here.

694
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,600
It was also her who struggled

695
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,440
at the brink of death.

696
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,040
Why don't you ask grandmother?

697
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,400
See if

698
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,200
she's willing to see Big Madam.

699
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,320
Let's stop talking about these idle matters.

700
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,120
I can see

701
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,240
how big both of your abdomens are now.

702
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,000
Looking at them

703
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,240
and counting the days,

704
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,240
Rulan might give birth earlier than you.

705
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,800
I heard that Fifth Brother-in-law

706
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,040
personally inquired about the midwives.

707
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,920
Your days

708
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,240
are really not bad.

709
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,120
What

710
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,000
he can handle

711
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,240
are just these measly things.

712
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,320
As long as my mother-in-law

713
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,400
doesn't keep putting on airs all day,

714
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,760
like asking me to stand under the sun

715
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,680
as punishment,

716
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,120
everything else will be actually bearable.

717
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,440
They might be matters between a mother-in-law and a daughter-in-law,

718
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,840
but at the bottom of it all,

719
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,360
it's still a matter between husband and wife.

720
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:24,840
As long as Fifth Brtoher-in-law

721
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,760
has s mirror-like heart,

722
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:26,960
Fifth Sister

723
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,040
will surely not suffer.

724
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,960
Indeed.

725
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,160
Fortunately, your husband's mother has passed away.

726
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,160
But seeing

727
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,480
now marquis isn't in the manor,

728
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,240
you still need to be more careful.

729
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,000
What she said is so right.

730
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,120
You should have told me that Danju is getting married off today，

731
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,800
so I could have organized it

732
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,080
on your behalf.

733
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,680
You even personally exhausted yourself.

734
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,200
It's not good if your child's health gets affected.

735
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,440
Thank you for caring.

736
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,760
Actually,

737
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,600
everything was planned half a year ago.

738
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,280
It's no big deal.

739
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,640
Danju is my trusted aide.

740
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,200
She surely must be married off

741
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,160
from the marquis manor.

742
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,710
Now, I am still able to

743
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:03,680
personally organize events like this.

744
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,960
This is also a fate

745
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,040
between us as master and servant.

746
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,560
Big Madam,

747
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:12,960
it's almost time.

748
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,960
Danju said that she wants to bid you farewell.

749
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,520
This is your slave contract.

750
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,000
Inside this is your residence certificate.

751
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,640
It has been processed in the magistrate office.

752
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,000
From now on, you're no longer a slave.

753
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,760
You're already an ordinary citizen.

754
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,400
You must have a good life.

755
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,880
Don't cry.

756
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,480
Today is a joyous day.

757
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,520
Your make-up will get destroyed.

758
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,520
I remember back then that

759
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,520
Miss loved to eat rose flaky pastries the most.

760
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,560
You also loved to read books

761
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,440
while sitting on the railing of the corridor.

762
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,000
That's right.

763
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,000
You even sewed me

764
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,475
a fabric wrap overnight

765
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,640
and tied it on the railing,

766
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,880
afraid that I wound jumped down.

767
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,400
But that wrap wasn't made sturdy enough.

768
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,680
It ripped open,

769
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,880
causing you to fall on the floor.

770
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,920
Afterwards, Nanny Fang scolded me

771
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,160
for not dissuading you

772
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,080
when you're already sitting in an unstable manner,

773
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,500
and even coming up with rotten ideas.

774
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,640
She said that she wound punish me.

775
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,560
My bones were in pain afterwards

776
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,360
and had to lie in bed for three days.

777
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,080
You then cried by my side for three days.

778
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,440
When I recovered,

779
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,800
you instead fell ill.

780
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,480
Afterwards, you promised me that

781
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,120
you wouldn't sit on the railing again.

782
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,400
You even asked me to do a pinky swear.

783
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,840
Miss

784
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,320
I really can't bear to part with you.

785
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,600
You'll live a good life.

786
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,000
You still are going to bear children,

787
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,520
and have a harmonious and beautiful life.

788
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,000
Let me bow to you then,

789
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,800
Miss.

790
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,400
Quickly get up.

791
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,360
Be good.

792
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,240
Be good.

793
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,520
Let's go.

794
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,320
Stop crying!

795
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,760
Your make-up is getting destroyed. Look at that.

796
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,680
Come. Raise the carriage!

797
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,440
Since you can't bear to part with her,

798
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,520
why not just let her stay?

799
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,280
Just look for an able butler

800
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,240
to marry her.

801
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,600
She and Xiaotao

802
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,880
were with me since I was little.

803
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,280
As long as she can have a good marriage life,

804
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,720
I'm also at ease.

805
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,960
Marrying an able butler

806
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,360
is also good grace.

807
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,760
There's nothing wrong about it.

808
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,840
You usually treated them so well.

809
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,400
Seeing how you're in pain,

810
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,280
she should have taken the initiative to stay.

811
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,080
Okay. Okay.

812
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,840
You don't know anything. Stop saying nonsense.

813
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:41,960
Although her words were nonsensical,

814
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,600
she's also thinking for your sake.

815
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,000
You have so many maidservants by your side.

816
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,680
If everyone will be married off,

817
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,960
and you're going to manage them all like this,

818
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,840
how can your body take it?

819
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,240
Only her and Xiaotao.

820
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,320
I heard that a few days ago,

821
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,520
Eldest Miss and Fifth Miss

822
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,600
stayed in the House of Gu

823
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,280
until sunset before leaving.

824
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,680
Just to send off a servant to get married?

825
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,400
A servant got married off.

826
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,200
A marchioness

827
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,640
and a two noble wives went to send her off?

828
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,680
Will you believe it if anyone told you that?

829
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,640
I really can't think of a reason.

830
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,520
For problems in our maiden house,

831
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,120
everyone knows about it,

832
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,400
except me.

833
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,360
It shows that they don't treat me as a daughter

834
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,520
of theirs anymore.

835
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,800
Sister-in-law,

836
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,440
that Liang Family is also a lair of problems.

837
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,880
Now that I have no children,

838
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,680
it's really hard for me to make a footing.

839
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,720
I hope grandmother can help me contact Old Madam He,

840
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,400
who's an expert in obstetrics,

841
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,280
so she can examine me.

842
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,280
If I'm fated to have no child,

843
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,440
I'll accept it.

844
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,760
I heard that

845
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,760
Liang Sixth treats you very well.

846
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,720
By saying those words,

847
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,160
you're bringing him shame.

848
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,080
Sister-in-law, you have a good fate.

849
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,040
You met a man like our Second Brother,

850
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,520
who has both integrity and talent.

851
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,960
I'm unable to tell anyone

852
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,480
the hardships I suffer there.

853
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,480
We both are wives

854
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,840
I'm sure you understand my hardships.

855
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,800
There's no need for little sister to rush.

856
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,840
No matter which concubine bears a child,

857
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,080
they will all be under you.

858
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,560
Maybe,

859
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,680
my husband and I are

860
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,960
really not fated to have many children.

861
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,680
In these past years, none of the pregnancies

862
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,920
of these concubines were able to be carried to term.

863
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,480
Two years ago, it wasn't easy to have a child born,

864
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,760
but it didn't survive long.

865
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,840
Until now, when my husband thinks about it,

866
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,600
he can only sigh.

867
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,240
Sister-in-law,

868
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,120
just pity me

869
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,080
and let me see grandmother.

870
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,400
We're one family.

871
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,880
No need to say such words.

872
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,520
Sadly, grandmother fell ill a few days ago.

873
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,240
I don't know how long she needs to recuperate.

874
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,360
It might delay

875
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,160
your matter.

876
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,120
It's better for your husband to just request

877
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,920
an imperial physician to have you checked.

878
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Grandmother is sick?

879
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,760
What's going on?

880
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,560
The more I should go to visit her.

881
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,440
It's no big deal.

882
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,520
She is old.

883
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,440
We eat different grains.

884
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,320
How can we not get sick?

885
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,080
She'll be fine after resting.

886
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,560
Fourth Little Sister,

887
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,920
it's getting dark.

888
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,600
Go back after seeing your brother.

889
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,280
Sister

890
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,600
This tea was made well.

891
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,640
After marrying into the House of Liang,

892
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,960
your talent for refined crafts

893
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,480
have really improved.

894
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,840
Since I married into the House of Liang,

895
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:05,880
I seemed to

896
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,360
not be a daughter of the Sheng Family anymore.

897
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,200
I don't know anything about what's happened here.

898
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,360
Even with grandmother getting sick,

899
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,560
I was unable to practice my filial piety by her side.

900
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,800
Older Brother,

901
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,280
why is

902
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,640
grandmother sick?

903
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,760
Didn't father already report it

904
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,520
in his leave of absence document?

905
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,640
Didn't your husband hear it?

906
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,440
It says that there was a thief in our house

907
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,680
that traumatized grandmother,

908
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,640
causing her to be ill and bedridden.

909
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,520
But I don't believe it.

910
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,600
What's there to not believe about it?

911
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,360
If grandmother is really sick,

912
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,920
why did Wang Ruofu

913
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:48,880
return to our hometown in Youyang?

914
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,560
Aren't you suspicious about this?

915
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,560
Older Brother,

916
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,440
since Little Mother died,

917
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,320
only the two of us

918
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,360
are real biological siblings

919
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,680
here.

920
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,200
How long do you plan to

921
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,160
hide this from me?

922
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,600
I'm not the only one.

923
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,560
Isn't there still this child?

924
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:17,120
This is my legitimate daughter.

925
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,880
Which is also your niece.

926
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:20,760
We're still

927
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,680
a lively family.

928
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,120
Enough.

929
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:25,720
What event hasn't our grandmother,

930
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,240
the only daughter of the Marquis of Yongyi,

931
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,560
not seen?

932
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:29,800
Can she got traumatized

933
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,760
by just a thief in our house?

934
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,000
If you really believed those words,

935
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,480
you're really foolish.

936
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,320
I think that

937
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,240
you don't need to

938
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,280
take some civil examination anymore.

939
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:41,960
Little Sister,

940
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,640
for people like us,

941
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,000
what's the use of knowing too much?

942
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:49,960
If you like,

943
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,720
just frequently come here

944
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,520
to visit your niece.

945
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,720
This can count as being reunited.

946
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,880
I think that

947
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:57,600
ugly wife

948
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,680
of yours

949
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,860
has stirred your heart and brain

950
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:00,880
into becoming nothing.

951
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,960
Think about how you were before.

952
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,040
You gambled and drank

953
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,120
with those high officials and noble person.

954
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,280
How splendid was your life then?

955
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,600
Now, you're just staying at home

956
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,840
and is just a juzi.

957
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,640
Little Mother and I

958
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,160
are both very competitive people.

959
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,080
How come I get to have a

960
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,000
good-for-nothing brother?

961
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,320
And you only get to

962
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,400
have a daughter like that.

963
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,400
I don't really know what you're happy about.

964
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,080
I'm already contented to

965
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,400
have this child.

966
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,800
But looking at you,

967
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,880
even if you become the Countess,

968
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:35,920
you are not happy.
