00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,919
Episode 5

3
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:04,760
It takes a decade to grow trees，

4
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,440
but a century to train a man.

5
00:01:05,919 --> 00:01:07,360
It would be best for your Majesty

6
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,919
to bring in and adopt a child from the Imperial clan!

7
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:23,919
Are you forcing me to abdicate?

8
00:01:25,199 --> 00:01:27,000
Your Majesty, please be appeased.

9
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:30,760
These are just the shallow views

10
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,199
of ours.

11
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,680
Your Majesty lost a young son.

12
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:38,919
When Your Majesty is in pain, we are also in pain!

13
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,199
Your Majesty grieves for your son,

14
00:01:41,199 --> 00:01:43,239
we ministers grieve for the country!

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,480
May Your Majesty please adopt from the Imperial family,

16
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,760
test their moral levels,

17
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,239
select the best

18
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:53,639
and choose him as the heir.

19
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,160
Are you all going to do this

20
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,639
with no scruple about my dignity?

21
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:13,039
You still say you're not forcing me?

22
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:27,759
I lost a son,

23
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,720
but still pushed myself

24
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,000
to attend court and govern the country.

25
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,360
But you ungrateful,

26
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,080
shameless lot!

27
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:40,600
You dare to force me

28
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,240
in this great hall!

29
00:02:57,399 --> 00:03:00,000
I did not want to hurt your feelings, Your Majesty,

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,360
but I must insist

31
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,039
on doing this today.

32
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:04,199
Silence!

33
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,039
It's to maintain

34
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,360
Your Majesty's integrity in the later years.

35
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:10,520
Your Majesty, please adopt from the Imperial family.

36
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,039
test their moral levels,

37
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:12,679
Mutinous!

38
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,800
Choose from the best,

39
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:14,759
You mutinous bastard!

40
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,240
and establish him as the heir!

41
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,119
Bastards!

42
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,039
This is the nation's foundation,

43
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:22,440
Your Majesty!

44
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,240
Court is adjourned!

45
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:38,360
Court is adjourned!

46
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:41,000
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,399
You…

48
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:42,080
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

49
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,559
Guards! Guards!

50
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,520
Your Majesty!

51
00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:49,440
Your Majesty. Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

52
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:52,679
If we can settle

53
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,320
the matter of adopting from the Imperial clan,

54
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:58,240
even if I get beaten twenty strokes,

55
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,479
I will be content!

56
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,279
Fine.

57
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,279
About adopting an heir,

58
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,320
I will listen to your advice.

59
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:17,480
I will leave it to whoever you want to appoint.

60
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,799
Your Majesty.

61
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,359
Your Majesty

62
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:43,440
do you suspect me

63
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,399
that I want to win that favor of the heir?

64
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,399
Your Majesty,

65
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,399
look at this old man!

66
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:55,000
This hair and beard,

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,200
I'm more than seventy years old now.

68
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,760
I don't have any children.

69
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,799
Why would I have such selfish concern?

70
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:10,320
Royal heir is the foundation

71
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,839
of the national security.

72
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:18,959
So much turbulence happened in the past.

73
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,959
Each came from the lack of early decisiveness!

74
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,399
Be decisive, Your Majesty!

75
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:47,519
If you say to appoint an heir,

76
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:50,279
we will appoint an heir.

77
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:55,640
If you say to adopt from Imperial clan, I will adopt.

78
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,320
Whether I select or not,

79
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,040
someone has to come and be the Emperor,

80
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:12,359
but I no longer have a son!

81
00:06:16,799 --> 00:06:17,920
Who?

82
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,480
Who can give me my son back?

83
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,320
Who can give me my son back?

84
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:31,320
Who?

85
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,839
That Lin Qinshuang,

86
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,720
isn't she a witch?

87
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,760
A few days ago in Yangzhou,

88
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,640
the Magistrate neglected her.

89
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:10,519
She cried a bit, and she got his love again.

90
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Madam,

91
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,480
don't think of these unimportant matters.

92
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,480
Soon,

93
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,959
Scholar Zhuang will come to Bianjing.

94
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
We need our Young Master

95
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,519
to hurry and get ready to study.

96
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,000
Ming'er is not going to study?

97
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,880
In the first place, she's the youngest

98
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,320
She could not get up in the morning.

99
00:07:30,359 --> 00:07:32,040
Second…

100
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,200
Second, her concubine mother just passed away.

101
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,679
If she goes to the academy,

102
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:38,880
she would just be unfocused.

103
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,839
This time, even the Lordling

104
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:41,760
from Lord Qi's House

105
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:44,000
will come to our manor to study,

106
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,320
what a heavenly honor.

107
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,519
In the future, our Young Master and the Lordling

108
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:51,559
will be classmates.

109
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,359
When it comes to studying,

110
00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:56,079
Changbai says Second Brother Gu will come too.

111
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,279
I'm just worried about this.

112
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,279
That child comes from a great house,

113
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,920
but his manners are imperfect.

114
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,920
I don't want him to influence

115
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:03,839
our Changbai for the worse.

116
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:05,519
But thankfully he's not coming anymore,

117
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:07,959
he's going to the White Deer Academy for study.

118
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,079
I don't have to worry him then.

119
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:12,359
Let her study.

120
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:15,119
First, having something to do

121
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,920
will help her sorrow fade.

122
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,720
Second, she needs to understand some reasons too,

123
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,000
so she can be enlightened and learned.

124
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,720
Mother, you are right.

125
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,239
When the scholar is here,

126
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:29,920
we will have them go greet him.

127
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,919
I've loathed the madding crowd since I was a boy

128
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,799
While hills and mountains have filled me with joy.

129
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,799
By mistake I sought mundane careers

130
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,799
And got entrapped in them for thirty years.

131
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,719
Birds in the cage would long for wooded hills;

132
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:52,799
Fish in the pond would yearn for flowing rills.

133
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,359
So I reclaim the land in southern fields

134
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,760
To suit my bent for reaping farmland yields.

135
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,159
My farm contains a dozen mu of ground;

136
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,719
My cottage has eight or nine rooms around.

137
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:11,080
The elm and willow cover backside eaves

138
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,840
While peach and plum trees shade my yard with leaves.

139
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:19,200
The distant village dimly looms somewhere,

140
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,679
With smoke from chimneys drifting in the air.

141
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:27,000
In silent country lanes a stray dog barks;

142
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,599
Amid the mulberry trees cocks crow with larks.

143
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,359
My house is free from worldly moil or gloom

144
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,760
While ease and quiet permeate my private room.

145
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,599
When I escape from bitter strife with men,

146
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:47,719
I live a free and easy life again.

147
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:48,840
Master,

148
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,880
Take care.

149
00:09:52,599 --> 00:09:53,840
I've got it. Take care!

150
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:02,280
According to Zhang Hailing of last dynasty,

151
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,039
that wondrous natural talent

152
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:05,599
dominates an era .

153
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,479
Look at how he wrote the “ping” character.

154
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,239
Such handsome

155
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:12,799
ink strokes.

156
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,479
Sit.

157
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,760
His “ping-an” invitation

158
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:20,000
is my favorite.

159
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,799
I love Wang Youjun's character

160
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,000
an on the “ping-an” invitation.

161
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,320
An is a hard character to write.

162
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,359
In Wang Youjun's “an” character,

163
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,559
the side strokes are arched

164
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:28,520
and perfectly balanced in thickness.

165
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,799
It's the hardest to accomplish.

166
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,280
I've tried to work on it since youth.

167
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,719
Now,

168
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:35,559
I still haven't mastered it.

169
00:10:35,599 --> 00:10:38,200
That's not something you can learn in a rush.

170
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,320
This Wang Youjun is a great calligrapher?

171
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:44,280
I have no confidence in trying to study his handwriting,

172
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,400
It' a huge challenge.

173
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,799
You are just lazy.

174
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,200
How wonderful.

175
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,200
You are still in good health I hope.

176
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,119
By your grace, all good.

177
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,000
Grandmother, Old Madam, Madam, my respects to you all.

178
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,679
Sit.

179
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,119
My body

180
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:10,280
is still in good health,

181
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,479
I won't be returning home until Yanran

182
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,679
has been betrothed.

183
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,119
You should know about my family matters.

184
00:11:20,239 --> 00:11:22,039
There is no hope

185
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:23,679
in relying on her father and step-mother.

186
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:25,080
The father and son's calligraphy may be similar

187
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,679
but their personalities are different.

188
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:29,119
Every character in Wang Youjun's cursive scripts

189
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:30,400
is different.

190
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:33,760
But Wang Daling carved a new path,

191
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,000
completing everything with one stroke.

192
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,880
The top and bottom connected, with their pulses interlinked.

193
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,679
Such a father and son and the existence

194
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:42,159
of that penmanship

195
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,000
Is really the good luck of this whole world.

196
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You are right, Uncle.

197
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,719
Then I shall go and change.

198
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:51,919
Go then.

199
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:56,320
This child is mature.

200
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,239
A good child.

201
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:01,599
Later,

202
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:04,760
have the Ming girl take Yanran play in the room.

203
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,320
At my house,

204
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,200
You can let the children enjoy themselves as they wish.

205
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,400
The little girl can be quite cute, if she is a little wild.

206
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:12,239
Mother.

207
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:14,000
I have been good.

208
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,119
I didn't be a wild girl.

209
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:17,239
I wasn't talking about you.

210
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,320
So unruly.

211
00:12:35,239 --> 00:12:35,840
Second Brother Gu,

212
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,840
when will he be back?

213
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,039
It will take a few months.

214
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,960
He can only come back when he gets all the loose ends fixed.

215
00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:46,440
I heard he's already

216
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,880
passed the provincial level Imperial Exam

217
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,000
at White Deer Academy.

218
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,359
He can just come to our academy

219
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,520
and study under Scholar Zhuang.

220
00:12:51,599 --> 00:12:52,760
Is that true?

221
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:55,320
He told me that

222
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,320
He would come back for the next Imperial exam.

223
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:02,520
It will be best if he returns.

224
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,200
He used to be hedonistic

225
00:13:08,239 --> 00:13:10,000
and never took anything seriously.

226
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,719
Now he's devoted to his studies for a few years,

227
00:13:12,719 --> 00:13:14,799
and he's passed the first level exam.

228
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:19,479
You! With studies

229
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:22,599
you're not accomplished in anything!

230
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,159
You don't feel shamed?

231
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:27,599
Still asking when he will be back?

232
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,320
I'm telling you,

233
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,799
after the Lantern Festival,

234
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:34,200
if Scholar Zhuang isn't content about your essay,

235
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:37,520
He will definitely tell your father.

236
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:39,599
I just came across some areas I don't understand

237
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:40,479
when I study them,

238
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:42,119
so I want to ask you for help.

239
00:13:43,719 --> 00:13:44,599
Lately,

240
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:47,200
you have improved some.

241
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,119
That's good.

242
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:51,559
If there's anything you don't understand,

243
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:52,440
I will teach you.

244
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,039
I won't hide it from you,

245
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:58,039
but soon I have a poetry society meeting

246
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:58,960
with Qiaojiu and the rest.

247
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,000
It's the second day since the New Year.

248
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,080
Old Madam Yu and the Young Lord

249
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,000
came to pay a visit.

250
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,119
What do you mean, “poetry society”?

251
00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:07,400
Stay home for the dinner!

252
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,599
I need to go now for

253
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,960
I don't want to miss this appointment.

254
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,679
I will learn from you another day.

255
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm leaving!

256
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:14,520
You..!

257
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,080
Are you thinking of

258
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,479
having your meal here before you leave?

259
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,919
I heard Old Master Yu would come in the evening.

260
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:28,000
Since I am an exam candidate,

261
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,359
I should seek

262
00:14:29,359 --> 00:14:31,200
more knowledge from my predecessors.

263
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,479
Who are you coaxing?

264
00:14:32,479 --> 00:14:33,840
You just want to stay at Sheng's

265
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,599
to be alone with Sixth Miss.

266
00:14:34,599 --> 00:14:36,200
Shut up!

267
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,119
It is alright to go home later

268
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:39,400
after coming to pay a visit.

269
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:40,960
But mother already told us

270
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,039
to get back for dinner.

271
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:44,000
Then so be it.

272
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,320
Let's bid them farewell

273
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,960
later before we leave.

274
00:14:47,599 --> 00:14:48,960
Thank you, Brother.

275
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,960
Wait for me here.

276
00:15:11,719 --> 00:15:12,400
Brother, is it already this quickly?

277
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,000
Where is my handkerchief?

278
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,880
Where is my handkerchief?

279
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:19,239
Did you drop it back there?

280
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,440
Come.

281
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,880
Let's backtrack our movements first.

282
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,599
If it still can't be found,

283
00:15:26,599 --> 00:15:28,119
I must have lost it at the hall.

284
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:29,640
If it's not there, then…

285
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,479
This handkerchief was bought at a store

286
00:15:34,479 --> 00:15:35,760
and it isn't worth much.

287
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:37,320
We are wasting our time looking for it.

288
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,000
It's almost time to eat.

289
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,119
We'd better just bid farewell

290
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:41,159
and go home.

291
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,520
I must find it.

292
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:43,520
Not only do I need to find it,

293
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,320
But also I need to make a splash.

294
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,840
Whether I can find it doesn't matter.

295
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,000
What matters is that

296
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:49,559
everyone should know that

297
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:51,719
I have lost my handkerchief.

298
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:53,200
It is kind of personal item.

299
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,159
If it falls into another's hand

300
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,559
and she brings it out again later,

301
00:15:56,599 --> 00:15:57,159
I can never give

302
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:58,119
a good enough explanation.

303
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:19,640
Uncle.

304
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:22,239
My handkerchief is lost.

305
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,880
Your handkerchief is lost?

306
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:31,960
It's not worth much money,

307
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,640
so it's not worth making a fuss.

308
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,520
It's because it was

309
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,359
embroidered by my mother.

310
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,159
You are a very filial son.

311
00:16:40,119 --> 00:16:41,840
Help him to look for it.

312
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,479
Alright.

313
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,599
Thank you, Uncle.

314
00:16:45,599 --> 00:16:46,599
Don't worry. It won't remain lost.

315
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,320
Sit here and wait.

316
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,200
Okay.

317
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,640
You could have dropped it any where.

318
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,880
Wait for a while.

319
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:01,400
Your family has the best

320
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,280
rose cakes.

321
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:04,800
Our Sixth Miss also loves to eat them.

322
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:05,839
Old Madam specially instructed

323
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,479
the kitchen to make these.

324
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,760
Eldest Miss,

325
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,599
you should do us a favor to eat some.

326
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,880
I eat will a lot then.

327
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,439
Here.

328
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:16,079
Here.

329
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,959
Suqin?

330
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,479
Go back to the room first.

331
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,319
This

332
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:43,800
will take some time.

333
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:49,880
Look, this has nothing to do with us.

334
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,839
Why don't you go to my room to have a rest first?

335
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:53,239
When dinner is ok,

336
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,719
they will call us.

337
00:18:09,199 --> 00:18:10,119
Madam.

338
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,760
I couldn't find it.

339
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:12,959
Madam.

340
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,680
I couldn't find it.

341
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,239
Summon all who have been to the main hall and

342
00:18:17,239 --> 00:18:18,479
get them to the side hall to see me.

343
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,319
Yes. Yes.

344
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:22,920
This Young Lord

345
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,479
is always afraid to trouble others.

346
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,000
But he's making such a fuss now.

347
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:28,959
It's very strange.

348
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,400
Because that handkerchief

349
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,680
is an item close to body.

350
00:18:32,719 --> 00:18:34,000
Even if he doesn't find it,

351
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,719
he needs to let others know it.

352
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,160
Or if something happens later on,

353
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,680
it will be hard to explain the reason clearly.

354
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,719
The Young Lord is so thorough in thought.

355
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:48,000
He always carries himself prudently,

356
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,880
but I keep feeling

357
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,839
there's something strange.

358
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,479
I don't know

359
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:55,520
How did I take it?

360
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,160
It really wasn't I that stole it, Madam.

361
00:18:58,599 --> 00:18:59,760
I didn't steal this.

362
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,000
I don't know.

363
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,479
I don't know how I took it!

364
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,199
I don't know how I took it!

365
00:19:02,239 --> 00:19:03,560
I really didn't steal it!

366
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,479
Madam.

367
00:19:07,199 --> 00:19:08,160
I really didn't steal it!

368
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,000
Your mother is really skillful.

369
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:10,199
She found the thief

370
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:11,160
that fast.

371
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,199
I don't know how I took it!

372
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:14,079
She found the thief?

373
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:15,959
Let's go now.

374
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,119
Luckily,

375
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:25,239
your mother found the thief,

376
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,560
or we wouldn't know

377
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,280
how to answer to Young Lord.

378
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,199
Why would a maid

379
00:19:30,199 --> 00:19:31,439
steal the handkerchief?

380
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:33,760
It must be for selling it.

381
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:37,439
No, if it's for thieving money,

382
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:38,280
The Young Lord had so many items

383
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:39,520
that are more valuable

384
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,680
than the handkerchief.

385
00:19:40,719 --> 00:19:41,599
Why didn't she steal those?

386
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,680
If it's not because it's valuable,

387
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,199
then…

388
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,599
it's for…

389
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,280
This is not right.

390
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,400
If it's because she coveted the Young Lord,

391
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,800
then she would want to keep that handkerchief

392
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,079
on her at all cost.

393
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,280
My father was in the hall just now.

394
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:09,239
When he said

395
00:20:09,239 --> 00:20:10,680
he wanted the handkerchief found,

396
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,520
she must have heard it

397
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,359
in the hall.

398
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,520
But we just walked

399
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,479
this path,

400
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,000
and she could've easily

401
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,199
just thrown the handkerchief somewhere

402
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:22,719
and she would be spared from implication and

403
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:24,839
she could come back later to fetch it.

404
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:26,479
Wouldn't that be the perfect plan?

405
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,760
It seemed so.

406
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,400
Then how could..

407
00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:34,079
It must be the person who stole the handkerchief

408
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:35,520
passed by her

409
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,199
and stuffed the handkerchief

410
00:20:37,239 --> 00:20:40,160
into her hand,

411
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,599
but she didn't find.

412
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,920
That's how they found it when they searched her.

413
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You mean someone planted the stolen handkerchief on her?

414
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,160
But the one who planted it,

415
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,079
why didn't she throw it on the path

416
00:20:49,199 --> 00:20:51,400
yet not stuff it into Suqin's clothes instead?

417
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,319
Because that person couldn't.

418
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,479
I don't understand.

419
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:02,000
It means the one who stole the handkerchief

420
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,199
couldn't come out here.

421
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:04,359
She couldn't leave.

422
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:06,119
She couldn't throw it on the pathway.

423
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:08,719
She was confined to the hall.

424
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:10,760
Suqin?

425
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,319
She was falsely accused. Falsely accused!

426
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,359
Wait.

427
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,839
If you tell mother,

428
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,079
would she believe it?

429
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,160
And if she said it, it would make her lose face

430
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,319
and you are adding oil to the fire.

431
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:28,959
Perhaps that maid may be punished

432
00:21:28,959 --> 00:21:29,880
even more severely.

433
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,920
Let's go find the Young Lord,

434
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,920
it's his matter,

435
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,800
so he's the most persuasive person.

436
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,119
You can't,

437
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:39,800
The Young Lord, Young Lord.

438
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,319
The Young Lord is from outside the family,

439
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,000
so we can't ask him to do it.

440
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,800
Why don't we…

441
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,119
Why don't we look for Second Brother?

442
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:48,959
Alright, your Second Brother

443
00:21:49,199 --> 00:21:50,719
is always just without bias to family.

444
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,280
Let's go.

445
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,800
Young Lord.

446
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:11,560
Sixth Miss's is still a young girl

447
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,760
yet indeed so sharp as an old officer.

448
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,439
Also,

449
00:22:15,439 --> 00:22:16,760
we have been schoolmates for so many years.

450
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:17,920
How could I

451
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,839
just be an outsider male guest?

452
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,920
Forgive me, Young Lord.

453
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,599
I, we are going to

454
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:26,640
look for our Second Brother.

455
00:22:27,239 --> 00:22:28,000
No need.

456
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:31,680
I heard what you said,

457
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,839
and I already told Buwei to go.

458
00:22:33,199 --> 00:22:35,000
He will tell your Madam the details

459
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,160
of this wrongful accusation.

460
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:38,119
Don't worry,

461
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:40,400
I will definitely help her.

462
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,400
Really?

463
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:44,119
Yes.

464
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,079
The heaven loves to spare lives.

465
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:48,920
Young Lord, your merit is not shallow this time.

466
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:54,640
Sixth Miss has merit in this too.

467
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,199
It's heaven's merit.

468
00:22:59,719 --> 00:23:00,839
It's about to get dark.

469
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,800
At your leisure then, Young Lord.

470
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,839
You did me a favor.

471
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,680
I should thank you.

472
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:39,640
Tame the horse and train the soldiers,

473
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,160
mine the mountain and cast the weapons.

474
00:23:41,199 --> 00:23:44,119
Put together our strengths and work as one.

475
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:47,160
That is how Qin became the first dynasty.

476
00:23:48,439 --> 00:23:51,680
the Qin could assimilate others

477
00:23:51,719 --> 00:23:55,160
while the six went their separate ways.

478
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,680
Because the one was united and the six weren't.

479
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:03,439
Hence Su Xun stated,

480
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,359
the six nations offered bribes to Qin.

481
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,520
And Su Zhe also stated

482
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:10,000
that the warring states couldn't see that

483
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,719
Han and Wei nations had superior lands,

484
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,760
but Qin was aware.

485
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,959
Su Shi also stated nations should

486
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:22,719
gather and train soldiers to make a solid foundation.

487
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:29,079
Yuanruo, this invoked a lot sentiments from you.

488
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:30,400
Yes.

489
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,839
Then today,

490
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:39,400
let's all each write an essay on the Six Nations.

491
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,079
Dismissed.

492
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:48,880
Gratitude to Scholar Shuang for your teaching.

493
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,160
Sixth Miss, remain here.

494
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,800
No matter how many words he will punish you with,

495
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:05,280
don't forget to embroider my lotus pouch.

496
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,760
You don't postpone it.

497
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,599
Scholar.

498
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:19,520
This writing of yours.

499
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:23,439
I am ashamed.

500
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,560
If you can write the character “yong” well,

501
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,760
you can write all the characters well.

502
00:25:28,719 --> 00:25:31,119
This is the calligraphy rule left by Wang Youjun.

503
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:34,640
Write the word “yong” for me.

504
00:25:34,959 --> 00:25:35,839
If you write it well,

505
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:37,280
you won't need to copy the book today.

506
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,640
Then I'd rather copy the book.

507
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,719
I have trained hard for days

508
00:25:45,719 --> 00:25:47,199
and I still don't show improvement.

509
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:49,599
I don't dare to show my drawbacks before you.

510
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:52,599
No matter what punishments you dish out to me,

511
00:25:53,239 --> 00:25:55,000
I will willingly accept them.

512
00:25:57,199 --> 00:25:59,079
Fine.

513
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,119
It's noble for a person to have self-awareness.

514
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:06,560
Many calamities are courted

515
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:07,520
by the greed to handle what exceeds one's abilities.

516
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:09,839
Fine, then you transcribe the “Salt-Iron Discourses”.

517
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,479
Then you transcribe the “Salt-Iron Discourses”.

518
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:14,199
Hand it over to me in three days. You may leave.

519
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,160
The Salt-Iron Discourses?

520
00:26:17,479 --> 00:26:18,959
Scholar.

521
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:21,040
This is beyond me.

522
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,040
So many words in the “Salt-Iron Discourses”.

523
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,319
Give me one more day.

524
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:29,160
It's better,it's better if it's four days.

525
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,359
Lordling, what are you looking for?

526
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,839
Where is my jade pendant?

527
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:35,599
How about making you some

528
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:37,599
chives with striped bass?

529
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:41,040
A few days ago,

530
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,280
you didn't like

531
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,079
the quail cooked in the kitchen.

532
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:46,680
Some bamboo shoots came in today.

533
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,199
So I can make you

534
00:26:49,439 --> 00:26:51,719
three flavored bamboo shoots on fried quail

535
00:26:51,719 --> 00:26:53,520
with the…

536
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,920
fragrantly braised sea bass?

537
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,439
Lordling,

538
00:26:58,439 --> 00:26:59,959
I found your jade pendant.

539
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,160
You left it in your book.

540
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:06,319
Four days then.

541
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:08,839
You are not allowed to postpone it.

542
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,160
Thank you, Scholar.

543
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:16,239
Two bowls of bamboo shoots. Two bowls.

544
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,479
Fine.

545
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,160
Let's go!

546
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,239
Learn and dwell upon it.

547
00:27:22,719 --> 00:27:24,160
Miss is punished to copy the book again?

548
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,199
Why don't you find someone to help you to write it?

549
00:27:28,199 --> 00:27:28,959
How about Fourth Miss?

550
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,760
Why would Fourth Miss help me to write it?

551
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,040
She writes very well.

552
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:34,560
Once reading, the Scholar would know who writes it.

553
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,520
That's right.

554
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,800
I'm so stupid.

555
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,199
What about Fifth Miss?

556
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:41,119
She even begged you

557
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:42,319
to embroider a pouch for her.

558
00:27:42,719 --> 00:27:43,640
If you are punished to write,

559
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,439
you may not have time to embroider a pouch.

560
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,640
Why don't you ask her to help you?

561
00:27:49,199 --> 00:27:51,199
She's not begged me to embroider a pouch for her.

562
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,400
She ordered me to embroider a pouch instead.

563
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:54,520
The difference

564
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,599
between the two is great.

565
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:57,800
These two older sisters of mine.

566
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,160
I dare not ask them to do anything.

567
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:01,719
Just as long as they don't harm me,

568
00:28:01,719 --> 00:28:03,280
I am satisfied.

569
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:05,599
You're wrong though.

570
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:07,280
Old Madam dotes on you the most.

571
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,040
No one can harm you.

572
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,560
Yes, Grandmother dotes on me the most.

573
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,880
If she finds out

574
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,640
my writing is so bad and I require someone to help me,

575
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,319
she will be very upset.

576
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:19,920
I'll accompany you when you write it then.

577
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,719
Sixth Sister!

578
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,959
Greetings,Young Lord.

579
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,920
Your two elder sisters

580
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,119
both call me “Yuanruo”.

581
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:35,079
So why are you so formal?

582
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:44,599
Sixth Sister, though it's cold lately,

583
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,760
Madam Wu

584
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,599
of Count Yongchang

585
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,280
has founded a polo field

586
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,800
outside Xinzheng Gate.

587
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,079
There are screens on all sides and

588
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:57,199
people can play polo in it.

589
00:28:57,199 --> 00:28:58,599
The goals are set lower by half.

590
00:28:58,599 --> 00:28:59,760
Quite fun.

591
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,680
Has anyone from your manor been there before?

592
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:04,119
We have not.

593
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,439
Good then.

594
00:29:06,439 --> 00:29:07,359
Next time,

595
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,800
I will ask their Sixth Brother

596
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,880
to send an invitation here.

597
00:29:15,239 --> 00:29:16,719
By the way,

598
00:29:16,719 --> 00:29:19,000
Madam Wu also set up some rewards.

599
00:29:19,439 --> 00:29:22,160
They're all nice game ornaments.

600
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,359
You are sure to like them, Sixth Sister.

601
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,040
None of us sisters

602
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,479
know how to play Polo.

603
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,040
You needn't trouble yourself with it, Young Lord.

604
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:33,040
It's no trouble. No trouble at all!

605
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,560
It only takes the time

606
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,680
to drink a cup of tea to reach the count manor.

607
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,000
It's getting late.

608
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,760
We need to return to the courtyard for the meal.

609
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,920
Yes.

610
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,560
Today,

611
00:29:54,719 --> 00:29:55,640
why are you dismissed so late?

612
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,000
Scholar Zhuang said we did not wrote well.

613
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,760
and needs to transcribe the book.

614
00:30:01,439 --> 00:30:03,199
Again?

615
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,719
Then let me do half of it for you.

616
00:30:06,719 --> 00:30:08,520
I can imitate your writing.

617
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,760
The Scholar punished me to transcribe

618
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,839
and it's for my improvement.

619
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,239
I will just do it myself.

620
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,880
Xiaotao, let's not delay.

621
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,959
Wait.

622
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,160
These are fruits

623
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,959
sent in by the Yangzhou Office.

624
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:30,079
I hear they're only available every summer.

625
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,359
This batch was frozen in the ice cave

626
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:33,920
and when you eat them in winter, it'll still be fresh.

627
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,079
Try one,

628
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:54,000
and tell me if you like the flavor.

629
00:31:03,239 --> 00:31:04,680
Young Lord is not accustomed to it.

630
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,959
That's not how you peel the water caltrop.

631
00:31:28,479 --> 00:31:29,880
Miss, look!

632
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,719
Hurry to put it away!

633
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,439
Such a nice brush for me to use

634
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:04,160
is a waste.

635
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,160
Why did Young Lord give you a brush?

636
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,760
He should've given you more water caltrops instead.

637
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,719
They're powdery and sweet.

638
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,920
Water caltrops in the winter are a rare commodity.

639
00:32:12,959 --> 00:32:14,839
There couldn't be many more to be found.

640
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,280
Young Lord is afraid that my brush isn't good

641
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,319
so I can't write well.

642
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,160
Young Lord is quite muddled.

643
00:32:21,199 --> 00:32:22,079
Your writing,

644
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:23,719
no matter how great the brush, it's still bad.

645
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,680
Nonsense. It's not that bad.

646
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,199
That's not nonsense,though.

647
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:29,439
Old Madam

648
00:32:29,439 --> 00:32:30,640
teaches you to ride the horse

649
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,959
As teach you to practice writing, too.

650
00:32:31,959 --> 00:32:33,079
Whatever moon-and-stars ball skills,

651
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:34,439
you can master them

652
00:32:34,439 --> 00:32:36,000
right away.

653
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,599
It's just this calligraphy.

654
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:38,640
You blame the brush

655
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,079
and you blame the ink.

656
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:41,520
And you even blame the paper,

657
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,880
and nothing ever comes out very well.

658
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:46,239
Some things you just can't do well.

659
00:32:46,239 --> 00:32:48,040
I was born incapable,

660
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:50,000
so it's better not to put much hope in it.

661
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:50,920
I don't understand.

662
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,920
Do you mean the writing?

663
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,319
Young Lord is like an eagle.

664
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:03,079
The mighty eagle.

665
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:04,160
It is meant to soar over

666
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,839
the majestic mountains and high ridges.

667
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,880
I am just a swift under the roof eaves.

668
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,119
I can only watch from afar.

669
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:14,680
Since we were not born into the same nest,

670
00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:17,199
I won't hope to be with him.

671
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:24,359
Why not?

672
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:27,119
You're the best Miss in the world!

673
00:33:30,199 --> 00:33:31,680
If I were to think it like you,

674
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,160
I would be deceiving myself.

675
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,199
Pear blossoms fall in the courtyard

676
00:33:37,199 --> 00:33:38,239
overflowing with moonlight.

677
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,880
Willow catkins are draping the pond with a light wind.

678
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,640
Yan Tongshu's poetry is so great.

679
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,000
You understand Minister Yan very well.

680
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,439
If he were still alive,

681
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:51,119
he would deem you his soulmate.

682
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:53,239
What nonsense are you spouting?

683
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,760
Where are the catkins?

684
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,439
Putting on a fake elegant air!

685
00:33:58,439 --> 00:33:59,760
You people from Linqige just like to

686
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,359
speak words when you see human

687
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:02,880
and bark when you see dogs.

688
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,719
Fifth Sister, you only know a few words

689
00:34:06,719 --> 00:34:08,439
and you still are bold enough to tell me off?

690
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,040
I wonder who the laughable one is.

691
00:34:11,959 --> 00:34:13,840
Since the old times,

692
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:15,760
we girls who were born from the legitimate wife

693
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,520
learn to manage house and be the madam of a manor.

694
00:34:17,959 --> 00:34:20,199
Not like you, born from a concubine.

695
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,479
You can only rely on your coquetry

696
00:34:21,479 --> 00:34:24,000
to be singing of the wind and the moon.

697
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:31,000
Fifth Sister, you are just envious of me,

698
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,040
and hiding behind your birth as a legitimate one.

699
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,959
Envious? Why should I envy you?

700
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,520
You're envious that Brother Yuanruo and I

701
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,560
can discuss poetry happily.

702
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:43,080
While you,

703
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,679
putting on your air of being born from the legitimate wife,

704
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,360
you couldn't even talk to him.

705
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,520
Fifth Miss, what are you doing?

706
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,639
That belongs to my miss.

707
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:14,000
Look at this brush.

708
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,120
Does it look nice, Fourth Sister.

709
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,000
Look at this.

710
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:19,399
This brush must be

711
00:35:19,399 --> 00:35:21,320
made from the violet rabbit hair

712
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,439
of the northern border.

713
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,800
Shaped like a willow leaf, great for making a sharp stroke.

714
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,719
And this brush pot.

715
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:29,520
It's made of rhino's horn.

716
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,239
Oh, right.

717
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:38,120
How crisp is that sound?

718
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:42,000
That can only be the rosewood.

719
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,040
No wonder it's so crisp.

720
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,479
Sixth Sister's items

721
00:35:52,479 --> 00:35:54,120
are always granted to her by Grandmother.

722
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,280
What's that to you?

723
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,159
Grandmother is always plain.

724
00:35:58,159 --> 00:35:59,199
Why would she have such precious items?

725
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,560
They are gifted to her by Brother Yuanruo.

726
00:36:01,439 --> 00:36:02,239
You can have it.

727
00:36:02,879 --> 00:36:04,159
What?

728
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:05,239
Young Lord

729
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:07,280
took pity on my bad writing

730
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,399
and that I was punished by the Scholar

731
00:36:09,399 --> 00:36:10,520
to transcribe “Salt- Iron Discourses”.

732
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,959
Hence, he gave this brush to me.

733
00:36:12,959 --> 00:36:14,760
He said that if the brush was better so

734
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,120
I could write better too.

735
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:19,719
That bad penmanship of yours.

736
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,919
Even if you're gifted with His Majesty's brushes,

737
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:22,159
you won't do it any better.

738
00:36:22,399 --> 00:36:24,439
Don't worry about it.

739
00:36:24,439 --> 00:36:25,879
The issue is you don't have this brush!

740
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:27,959
It sounds like you have one.

741
00:36:27,959 --> 00:36:28,879
I didn't see Brother Yuanruo

742
00:36:28,919 --> 00:36:29,760
give you two of them.

743
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,879
I don't care at all.

744
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:33,280
Frankly, Fourth Sister is right.

745
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,199
If you can write the characters well,

746
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:37,239
even if you write on sand

747
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:38,120
with a tree branch,

748
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,239
you can still write well.

749
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,560
With calligraphy like mine,

750
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,760
Even if it's a brush from His Majesty,

751
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,560
it's still useless.

752
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:46,520
So these two brushes you

753
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,159
can have one each.

754
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,479
Then it's a pair.

755
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,239
That will do better justice

756
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,719
to Young Lord's excellent brushes.

757
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,520
Thanks.

758
00:37:03,479 --> 00:37:04,159
Let's go!

759
00:37:18,879 --> 00:37:19,639
The Young Lord

760
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:21,399
likes that Ming'er?

761
00:37:23,479 --> 00:37:25,719
Who said he liked her?

762
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:27,719
He's just kind at heart

763
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:28,879
and pitied her foolishness.

764
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:32,719
But what if

765
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:34,719
he actually likes the foolish kind.

766
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:37,239
Don't be too smart.

767
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:39,080
Mother, you're…

768
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:43,439
If he really likes her,

769
00:37:43,439 --> 00:37:44,760
how could she bear to give

770
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,040
the Young Lord's gifts to us?

771
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:50,520
That's because she can't tell the difference.

772
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:54,159
She's just a concubine's daughter.

773
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:57,120
How can she covet the sole heir of Qi House?

774
00:37:58,399 --> 00:37:59,919
But you are also a daughter of a concubine.

775
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,080
How am I the same as her?

776
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,120
I'm your daughter,

777
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,879
the Fourth Miss of the Sheng family.

778
00:38:06,439 --> 00:38:08,479
I live a life more noble than the legitimate daughter

779
00:38:08,479 --> 00:38:10,600
and I placed first at the last poetry match.

780
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,919
Who doesn't respect me?

781
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,800
How can that Little Sixth Sheng

782
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,040
bear comparison with me?

783
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,439
Yes, yes,

784
00:38:16,439 --> 00:38:18,600
when my daughter marries into the Qi family,

785
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,560
we'll make a rise in life.

786
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,120
Second Brother Gu is here!

787
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:04,800
Second Brother Gu.

788
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,199
Changfeng, Zecheng.

789
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,639
Slow down.

790
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,399
Why did you only bring Shitou?

791
00:39:15,399 --> 00:39:16,239
Where is the baggage?

792
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,959
You shouldn't go back empty-handed.

793
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,239
Just a few boxes

794
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:23,080
and a new family member?

795
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,520
What do you mean by a family member?

796
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:34,600
I met her in Bianjing

797
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,800
and I found her pitiful so

798
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,919
I gave her some silver to dismiss her.

799
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,000
Then his sinister older brother

800
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,320
tricked away everything from her.

801
00:39:43,159 --> 00:39:44,199
And she ran to White Deer Cave Academy

802
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:45,000
to seek me.

803
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,840
Her older brother

804
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,040
spent all the money

805
00:39:48,479 --> 00:39:49,360
and jumped down from the cliff and died.

806
00:39:49,959 --> 00:39:51,000
I saw how pitiful she was

807
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,639
with nowhere to go, so

808
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:56,000
I took her in.

809
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,120
She didn't come with me.

810
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,600
I settled her and some chests

811
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,879
in another place.

812
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,479
These are of no importance!

813
00:40:11,879 --> 00:40:13,679
Scholar Zhuang opens the academy

814
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:14,520
at 6'clock and he is strict

815
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,199
so we can't be late.

816
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,120
Han Niu.

817
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:19,080
Shitou,

818
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:19,959
there's nothing here.

819
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,120
Go with them

820
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:22,959
and help tidy up.

821
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Don't let them laze.

822
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:24,879
Okay, Master.

823
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,280
Brother Gu, where did this handkerchief come from?

824
00:40:27,919 --> 00:40:29,040
What great embroidery work!

825
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,280
Can't be that top prostitute Wei embroidered it personally?

826
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,560
I haven no use for it.

827
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,320
If you like it, take it then.

828
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,679
Hurry up now.

829
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:37,600
It's time.

830
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,600
Miss, don't sleep anymore.

831
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,840
Why do you sleep so much?

832
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:44,040
Fourth and Fifth Misses

833
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,120
never sleep much as you do.

834
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,439
Stop fanning.

835
00:41:12,879 --> 00:41:14,639
Stop fanning.

836
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,560
Yuanruo!

837
00:41:21,959 --> 00:41:23,040
What are you doing here?

838
00:41:23,879 --> 00:41:24,959
Second Uncle?

839
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,840
It's what I should ask you about.

840
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,239
Come here.

841
00:41:31,399 --> 00:41:32,280
Second Uncle,

842
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,399
I'm studying here.

843
00:41:34,399 --> 00:41:35,399
Hey, Young Lord,

844
00:41:35,399 --> 00:41:36,800
why did you call him Second Uncle here?

845
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:39,239
We are relatives back up the generations.

846
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:40,000
And at our generation,

847
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,080
I'm his nephew.

848
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,280
Second Uncle,

849
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,919
this is the Sixth Daughter of the Sheng family.

850
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,520
Sixth Miss.

851
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,360
Hello, Second Uncle.

852
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,760
We can't delay it.

853
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,320
Scholar Shuang will punish us

854
00:41:56,399 --> 00:41:57,600
if we're late.

855
00:41:58,959 --> 00:42:00,959
But he won't be early today.

856
00:42:00,959 --> 00:42:02,000
Since you're sleepy,

857
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,719
go nap a bit more.

858
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:04,600
Then you can come back.

859
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,520
Xiaotao.

860
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,280
Take care of your Sixth Miss.

861
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,080
Yes.

862
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:11,399
Sixth Sister,

863
00:42:11,399 --> 00:42:12,239
we are taking our leave.

864
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:13,719
Let's go!

865
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,479
Let's go.

866
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,600
Alright, Miss,

867
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:23,439
you got the Second Brother's permission,

868
00:42:23,439 --> 00:42:25,159
so lean on me to nap more.

869
00:42:26,439 --> 00:42:28,159
You really thought it was about nap?

870
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,000
Second Brother was…

871
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,679
was trying to

872
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:34,520
help me avoid suspicion,

873
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,600
in case others that see me

874
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,800
with the Young Lord together and gossip.

875
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,879
When Young Lord was here,

876
00:42:40,879 --> 00:42:42,159
why didn't you tell me?

877
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:44,560
If this happens again,

878
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,120
I'm going to kick you out.

879
00:42:46,919 --> 00:42:48,439
Fourth Miss and Fifth Miss

880
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,320
often laugh and talk with the Young Lord.

881
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:52,239
Last year's Lantern Festival,

882
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:54,239
we ran into the Young Lord while strolling

883
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:55,600
and both the Master and Madam saw.

884
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,439
Fourth and Fifth Misses

885
00:42:57,439 --> 00:42:59,360
even pestered the Young Lord to buy some lanterns.

886
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,879
You were the only one who didn't want to accept it.

887
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,919
We're different.

888
00:43:04,919 --> 00:43:06,000
The two of them,

889
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,560
one has dignity

890
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,479
while the other has the status.

891
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,679
They have parents to take care of them.

892
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,879
I only have Grandmother,

893
00:43:12,879 --> 00:43:14,919
and I can't cause trouble for her, right?

894
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,120
Yes.

895
00:43:22,959 --> 00:43:23,919
Young Master Gu is already back

896
00:43:23,919 --> 00:43:24,800
after finishing his studies.

897
00:43:27,879 --> 00:43:30,159
My mother has been deceased for so long now.
