00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,831
Episode 31

3
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,960
Miss,

4
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,360
you should stop doing this.

5
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,080
You should go look at the storage.

6
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,200
The Countess

7
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,440
sent a bunch of stuff again

8
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,840
and it's almost out of space in the storage!

9
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,280
Don't worry.

10
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,920
Soon

11
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,018
the Countess

12
00:01:30,018 --> 00:01:31,200
will not be coming to our home again.

13
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,960
Maybe

14
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,520
you'd like to reconsider, Miss?

15
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,440
Big Madam Wu

16
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,440
is a straight-shooter

17
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,120
and she gets along with you.

18
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,640
That's very hard to come by.

19
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,240
The Countess is great,

20
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,360
but her son

21
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,280
isn't the one to marry.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,720
Grandmother already told me

23
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,621
in detail about

24
00:01:54,621 --> 00:01:56,000
the tough story behind it,

25
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,040
so I can't disrespect

26
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,200
the elder's good intentions for me.

27
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,960
I think He House is better than Liang House.

28
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,360
You're so young, so what do you know?

29
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:15,880
Danju, you go and get

30
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,960
all the items sent by Liang House.

31
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,760
Count each one

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,160
store all in a box,

33
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,400
and place them in the guest room.

34
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,035
I will need to return them all

35
00:02:24,035 --> 00:02:24,920
to Liang House in the future.

36
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,040
Not one can be missing.

37
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,680
What a pity about so many nice items.

38
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,320
But what about the bracelet

39
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,480
you gifted to Fifth Miss?

40
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,200
It can't be

41
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,200
that you are going to pull it off of her wrist?

42
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,520
And also the leather goods

43
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,760
you gifted Fourth Sister?

44
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,520
I bought them all with my case-dough.

45
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,080
They weren't gifts from Liang House!

46
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,960
Case-dough?

47
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,080
Case-dough?

48
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,240
Miss!

49
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,960
Y-Your monthly allowance is already not much.

50
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,200
Though Old Madam helps you,

51
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,640
It is limited, too.

52
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,680
What about now?

53
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,200
You spent it on raising others.

54
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,680
We won't have anything to eat or wear!

55
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,080
You didn't see it, Miss.

56
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,560
Fourth Miss heard

57
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,080
Big Madam Wu came to visit Minglan again.

58
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:30,775
And she was foaming with rage.

59
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,200
If she didn't brush her hair

60
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,614
and pin it with a hairpin,

61
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,800
the roots would be

62
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,720
standing on end from fury!

63
00:03:37,887 --> 00:03:38,775
Listen,

64
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,320
in the future if something great like this happens,

65
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,000
you must remember to tell me

66
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,800
instead of hogging the fun alone.

67
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,440
Yes, I will remember it.

68
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,200
By the way,

69
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,160
I hear the Master

70
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,246
has started to look into a prospect

71
00:03:49,246 --> 00:03:50,200
for Fourth Miss.

72
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,058
He's brought in a few people

73
00:03:52,058 --> 00:03:53,040
in a row the last few days,

74
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,800
but all are just scholars.

75
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:55,982
He claims it's to accompany

76
00:03:55,982 --> 00:03:56,720
your Second or Third Brother .

77
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,640
for scholarly discussion.

78
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,520
But in fact,

79
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,600
it's for them to have a look at each other.

80
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,160
Scholars?

81
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,530
Must be some poor family's

82
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:06,800
candidate for the Iimperial exam.

83
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,680
Father

84
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,960
dotes on her usually.

85
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,920
But in the end,

86
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,720
he's still just going to find a family

87
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,320
that's lower-ranked than ours.

88
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,480
But father just doesn't know that

89
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,280
her eyes have climbed up to

90
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,600
the top of her head already.

91
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,480
She's still hoping to marry into a lofty house.

92
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,000
No way!

93
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,800
Xique,

94
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,520
look.

95
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,958
Look how pretty those blossoms are.

96
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,640
Pluck them for me.

97
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,040
Yes.

98
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:34,960
Careful.

99
00:04:35,194 --> 00:04:35,594
Ok

100
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,880
Miss, what's wrong?

101
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,617
Never mind

102
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,520
My handkerchief!

103
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,840
That's mine.

104
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,200
Miss.

105
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,160
Fifth Miss?

106
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,000
Yes.

107
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,200
Darling Hong, you've toiled lately.

108
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,960
You should move back

109
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,920
in instead of staying out.

110
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,400
We'll see in a few days.

111
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,920
After Molan's matter is done,

112
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,760
it's not too late to move back then.

113
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,280
Countess Yongchang came.

114
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,480
I guess

115
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,000
it's for marriage talk for Sixth Miss.

116
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,880
Minglan's marriage.

117
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,960
It'll only count after asking Old Madam's opinion,

118
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,240
so you needn't think much of it.

119
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,100
Yes, definitely.

120
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,640
The glory of a count's manor,

121
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,960
I don't dare to think much of it.

122
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,723
Just that seeing how the Sixth Miss'

123
00:06:47,723 --> 00:06:49,280
marriage prospect is nearly set.

124
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,360
In the past, you spoke about

125
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,680
the literature student to me.

126
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,920
I don't think that's quite suitable.

127
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,280
You women who live inside your courtyards.

128
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,240
You don't know about

129
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,000
how to see a scholar.

130
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,000
Yes,

131
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,514
darling Hong's discernment

132
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:08,920
in seeing a student is high-level, of course.

133
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,640
It's just that

134
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,120
for a woman to select a husband,

135
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,040
it's not really to seek name with merit,

136
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,000
it's only to seek a good person who is kind,

137
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,760
who can afford to feed and clothe us.

138
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,400
It's just that,

139
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,080
this literature student

140
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,760
is so poor.

141
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,880
If our Molan marries over there,

142
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,920
I fear

143
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,099
she will have to suffer

144
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:37,520
twenty years of bitterness first.

145
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,040
His family is

146
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,960
really not that dire in poverty.

147
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,400
It's only that the family property isn't too much,

148
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,120
but that child is an outstanding talent.

149
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,040
Darling Hong,

150
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,200
even if he's an outstanding talent

151
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,790
so that he might be conferred

152
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,880
as a marquis or high minister,

153
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,840
I still won't feel jealous.

154
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,400
I only want Molan to have

155
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,720
a mouthful of warm food to eat.

156
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,080
Darling Hong, please dote on Molan.

157
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,600
It seems that

158
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:06,120
you are not satisfied

159
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,160
with this son-in-law I found.

160
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,400
In that case,

161
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,040
why did beat about the bush?

162
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,400
Just to put it bluntly instead,

163
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,880
and you'll spare me from wasting my words!

164
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,720
Darling Hong...

165
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,760
I'm going to the study.

166
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,520
Darling Hong!

167
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,000
Darling Hong, you misunderstood me.

168
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,680
I didn't misunderstand!

169
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,360
Molan.

170
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,760
Molan, be good.

171
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,640
Don't cry.

172
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,320
Molan!

173
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,760
Don't worry.

174
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,120
Your father won't plan for you?

175
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,680
I will plan for you!

176
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,040
Aunt.

177
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,640
These days you've been in the capital,

178
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,692
I imagine you've exhausted

179
00:09:07,692 --> 00:09:08,680
all the money you had.

180
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,640
Please just take these for now

181
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,440
and tell me if you run out.

182
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,520
I don't need any money.

183
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,240
I am used to bitter days.

184
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,360
I only hope

185
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,880
this matter can quickly

186
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,520
be done to clear it up

187
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,560
and I can return

188
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,720
to my Yangzhou swiftly.

189
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,840
Hence,

190
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,760
I've looked into the details

191
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,440
of Count Yongchang Manor's

192
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,695
visit to fill the oil

193
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:31,200
and burn the incense.

194
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,320
What is it?

195
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,280
On the fifteenth of this month,

196
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,512
Madam Wu will bring along the Sixth Son

197
00:09:35,512 --> 00:09:37,520
of Liang House to come together.

198
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,240
They will hold a big ritual.

199
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,640
They are having people clean the area up everywhere.

200
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,640
I understand.

201
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,200
Then, will you come on that day?

202
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,200
I will not go.

203
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,531
If you will not be there,

204
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,480
then why did you ask me

205
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,360
to find out about it?

206
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
If you're not a fish,

207
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,921
even ten hooks

208
00:09:58,921 --> 00:09:59,840
won't find you.

209
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,000
But if you're a fish,

210
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,280
then even if I don't have a hook,

211
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,960
you will still jump on the shore

212
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,480
and eat up all the worms on the shore.

213
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,200
Aunt, walk me here,

214
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,560
so others don't see.

215
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
Go back first.

216
00:10:17,331 --> 00:10:17,760
Fine

217
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,400
Then you have to be careful going back.

218
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,240
Go.

219
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,680
What's wrong?

220
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,120
The wind and rain are all heavy.

221
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:47,960
You're about to get rained on.

222
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,280
You're about to get rained on.

223
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,987
It's better to come on the first

224
00:11:12,987 --> 00:11:13,520
and fifteenth of the month.

225
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,640
More people and more bustling.

226
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,280
I imagine

227
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,000
the wish might come true sooner.

228
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,880
The value of making a wish is in the heart,

229
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,280
not on the date.

230
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,320
What you said seems to make sense too.

231
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,880
This time,

232
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,720
it's to wish for a child especially.

233
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,320
Mother said

234
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,080
we must come out of the carriage and walk.

235
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,560
That way,

236
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,160
the divine one can see my sincerity.

237
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,680
They all say Yuqing Monastery

238
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,840
is most efficacious in pleading for children.

239
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,840
Someone

240
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,400
held a ritual here before,

241
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,360
and they got twin boys when they went home.

242
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,800
Miss,

243
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,640
they left.

244
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,880
Miss, don't be sad.

245
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,640
I am not sad.

246
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,120
I've been to Yuqing Monastery so many times

247
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,920
and I never noticed it before,

248
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,560
but standing here behind the tree,

249
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,160
I just discovered what an elegant scenery this is.

250
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,120
Such a delightful floral scent.

251
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,920
What a great scenery this is.

252
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,520
What are you praying for?

253
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,950
Nation's prosperity

254
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,520
and people's security to be everlasting.

255
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,400
And?

256
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,320
Peaceful family

257
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,840
and parental health.

258
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,600
And?

259
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,960
Praying for the gods

260
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,080
not to be too greedy.

261
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,280
Why didn't you beg for a child?

262
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,560
If it's destined for us, we will have one.

263
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,800
Why force it?

264
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,680
Then…

265
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,920
you don't want a child with me?

266
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,960
That's not it.

267
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,040
Then why didn't you pray for one?

268
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,920
May the Sanxinggrant me offspring.

269
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,800
I shall then renovate this hall

270
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,480
and make a new gold statue.

271
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,280
That's better.

272
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,680
May the Sanxing

273
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,040
watch over Sheng Minglan.

274
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,640
May she be safe and sound,

275
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,160
all things to her will.

276
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,880
Find a . . .

277
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,440
Find a good husband.

278
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,520
Give it to me.

279
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,240
Done!

280
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,676
These days

281
00:15:30,676 --> 00:15:33,200
you're frequenting Yuqing Monastery.

282
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,760
Lately, I keep seeing my mother in my dreams.

283
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,160
I feel uneasy,

284
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,120
so I went a few times more.

285
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,960
Now, the fragrant oil's been filled,

286
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,720
and we've celebrated her underworld birthday too.

287
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,200
My Little Mother isn't coming to my dreams anymore.

288
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,160
I imagine

289
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,360
she's already care her fetus with ease,

290
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,080
so I won't need to go again anymore.

291
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,720
Lately that man from He House

292
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,720
came to our home more frequently.

293
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,240
Then, next time he comes again,

294
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,240
I should thank him

295
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,560
for the medicine from Brother He.

296
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,720
He's treated my face

297
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,960
so that there's no scar at all.

298
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,760
It's true.

299
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,120
No matter how heavy the wound is,

300
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,280
in the end, you need to dig out the festered flesh,

301
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,680
apply medicine on the wound,

302
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,927
and treat it so there's

303
00:16:27,927 --> 00:16:28,880
no scar left at all.

304
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,640
That's right.

305
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,400
Grandmother, don't worry. I understand it.

306
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,760
Sixth Miss's stableman said

307
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,080
she's going to Yuqing Monastery on the fifteenth.

308
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,120
I checked at Yuqing Monastery,

309
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,320
and Count Yongchang Manor

310
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,520
also reserved that date.

311
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,600
Indeed,

312
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,320
the rumor I heard wasn't false.

313
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,600
This Sixth Miss

314
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,120
doesn't show off anything usually,

315
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,160
but she's such a shameless one!

316
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,480
She's not even married over yet,

317
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,000
and she's brown-nosing the mother-in-law already.

318
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,480
What do we do?

319
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,720
Is there no chance for me then?

320
00:17:01,884 --> 00:17:02,600
Miss don't worry.

321
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,480
In moments like this,

322
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,920
you must be much more calm

323
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,840
and think of a good countermeasure instead.

324
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,360
What countermeasure can I come up with?

325
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,600
I'm holed up in this room.

326
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,080
I can't even leave the doorway!

327
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,560
What do you expect me to do? Huh?

328
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,160
There's nothing to expect.

329
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,200
Then, just go out the door.

330
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,680
Father won't allow me to leave,

331
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,760
so how can I?

332
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,000
Come now,

333
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,454
we need to play

334
00:17:27,454 --> 00:17:28,280
a risky move for an all-in.

335
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,680
If it's up to me,

336
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,680
you will have to bear with the compromise

337
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,840
and abandon shame.

338
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,800
If you don't go,

339
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,720
then just sit here and be docile.

340
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,680
Wait for your father

341
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,520
to bring you an exam candidate

342
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,440
and just dismiss you haphazardly!

343
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,200
I... I don't want to marry some exam candidate.

344
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,600
If I do,

345
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,720
the one next door to us

346
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,480
will laugh her teeth off!

347
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,040
My good daughter.

348
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,200
Everyone has to go through hardships.

349
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,360
If I had been wishy-washy back then,

350
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,400
we wouldn't have this luxurious life of

351
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,160
being served by servants.

352
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,560
I hurried and got myself pregnant

353
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,960
with your Third Brother,

354
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,200
or else,

355
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,859
or else I would have been kicked out

356
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:09,440
by Sheng House long ago

357
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,880
and desolate on the streets!

358
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,120
Mother you are right.

359
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,040
If I can marry into the count's manor,

360
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,040
any compromise,

361
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,680
any shame,

362
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,640
that's not important.

363
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,840
Miss Luzhong.

364
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,880
Miss Luzhong!

365
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,320
Miss Luzhong.

366
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,360
You're going out?

367
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,640
Fourth Miss's rouge and hair oil

368
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,400
are out.

369
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,720
She says the one procured by the house isn't good.

370
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,640
So she ordered me

371
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,000
and Yunzai to buy the ones she likes.

372
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,040
Miss Yunzai?

373
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,240
Sister Yunzai's here too?

374
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:58,960
Yunzai ...

375
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:00,840
What's wrong?

376
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,480
Not just powder,

377
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,400
but two jade belts she reserved.

378
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,280
Yunzai's figure is similar to Fourth Miss,

379
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,000
so she's coming with me to try the clothes on.

380
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,240
If I see a good cicada cage

381
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,160
on the way,

382
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,480
I will get a couple for you.

383
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,320
Great.

384
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,680
Then, you go and get busy with your chores.

385
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,880
Hurry now. Go back.

386
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,880
If I see anything good,

387
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,480
I'll buy them all for you.

388
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,120
Hurry and go. Go, go.

389
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:20,760
Bye then.

390
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,440
Go back.

391
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:21,840
Hurry and go.

392
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,400
Go back.

393
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,760
Quickly go to Yuqing Monastery.

394
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,640
Okay.

395
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,400
Let's go.

396
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,920
It's still too early.

397
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,400
I heard there is a very beautiful spring

398
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,200
on the western side of the monastery

399
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,200
and the scenery there is good, too.

400
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,400
Let's go and have a look.

401
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,600
Mother,

402
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,520
I can't take it anymore.

403
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,920
I want to go home and rest.

404
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,520
You only have walked a few steps

405
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,400
and you're already complaining of being tired?

406
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,840
Mother,

407
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,320
you come here every three to five days.

408
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,080
Isn't it because you want to bump into

409
00:20:36,325 --> 00:20:37,400
that lady from the Sheng family?

410
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,400
I know that you're unwilling.

411
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,360
You still think about that bitch in your room.

412
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,280
If you really miss her,

413
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,081
then quickly agree

414
00:20:50,081 --> 00:20:51,720
to marry the Sheng lady.

415
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,440
I'll allow you to do what you want after.

416
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,560
When there is still no main wife,

417
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,384
which noble family

418
00:20:56,384 --> 00:20:57,760
would allow a concubine to enter first?

419
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,120
I'm not in a rush.

420
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,280
I'm afraid that

421
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,880
your little bitch Chunke's baby

422
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,920
can't wait!

423
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,400
While in front of

424
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,480
the Daoist spiritual master,

425
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,920
think about it well.

426
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,600
Let's go.

427
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:23,859
Young Master,

428
00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:25,360
are we returning to the manor?

429
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,280
No return!

430
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,600
Mother is going to

431
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,560
the Luqing Spring in the west.

432
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,760
Let's go walk around the eastern courtyard.

433
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,440
Did we arrive late?

434
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,747
Have the people from

435
00:22:19,747 --> 00:22:20,680
the House of Liang already left?

436
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,280
Their carriage is still outside.

437
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,240
They surely are still here.

438
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,400
Miss,

439
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,480
how about going there to take a look?

440
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,120
Little misses,

441
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,440
don't go forward anymore.

442
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,520
We heard that the flowers in the back garden of

443
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,440
Yuqing Monastery are blossoming beautifully.

444
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,080
We are about to look at them.

445
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,640
What flowers?

446
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,160
A young lad also said that

447
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,480
he's going to appreciate the flowers.

448
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,440
The garden is full of men.

449
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,440
If you two go in,

450
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,040
I'm afraid that your reputation might get tainted.

451
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,440
We'll be leaving now.

452
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,080
Heaven is really helping me.

453
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,180
Miss,

454
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,680
have you decided?

455
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,520
Are you really going in?

456
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,440
If you go,

457
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,880
your whole family will lose face.

458
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,600
My mother said it right.

459
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,920
Only our own pride

460
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,600
is what's important.

461
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,115
It's much more important than

462
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:19,915
the dignity of that House of Sheng.

463
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:26,840
You told me that

464
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,280
flowers are blooming majestically here.

465
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,800
Tell me, where are the flowers!

466
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,920
Young Master, I...

467
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,760
Are you going to let me—

468
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,280
Miss.

469
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,160
Are you alright?

470
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,720
Where are you hurt?

471
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,160
My god...

472
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,240
Your foot...

473
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,840
Miss, are you alright?

474
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,280
I must be dreaming!

475
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,880
Young Master, you are holding my hand.

476
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,000
How can it be unreal?

477
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,800
Get up.

478
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,640
Why are you here?

479
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,095
I heard the Young Master

480
00:24:46,095 --> 00:24:47,560
calling for me in my dream,

481
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,600
so I came.

482
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:52,960
Molan!

483
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,840
Greetings to Fourth Sister.

484
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,480
Little Sister, you're such a talent.

485
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,560
We became hostile to each other long ago

486
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,960
and you're still pretending to be nice.

487
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,320
I'm not bearing any grudge against Sister

488
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,160
wounding my face.

489
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,640
What?

490
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,767
Is Sister hating Father

491
00:25:46,767 --> 00:25:47,960
for punishing you to kneel?

492
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,120
Don't think that because you've won once,

493
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,160
you've completely defeated me.

494
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,320
A man's lifetime lasts for decades.

495
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,040
The road is still long.

496
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,400
Until that day that you're put inside a coffin,

497
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,560
everything else is not yet final.

498
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,880
Right.

499
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,600
Your days are still long, Sister.

500
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,600
You won't be put inside a coffin yet.

501
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,680
Sit down.

502
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,480
The weather is really too hot.

503
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,337
From now on, don't bother coming to greet me

504
00:26:33,337 --> 00:26:34,480
in the morning and attending to me at night.

505
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,360
You can just come over every first

506
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,000
and fifteenth day of the month.

507
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,200
Grandmother,

508
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,560
we are not that delicate.

509
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,640
It's just a few steps.

510
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,760
It isn't that hot.

511
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,760
Grandmother is caring for us.

512
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,520
Why don't you just appreciate it?

513
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,920
Among us sisters,

514
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,173
only Sixth Miss's Mucang Pavilion

515
00:26:53,173 --> 00:26:54,440
is the nearest.

516
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,560
Saying that it's only a few steps,

517
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,338
it's because you're talking while standing,

518
00:26:58,338 --> 00:26:59,000
and thus your back doesn't hurt.

519
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,560
Just finish your cold yogurt.

520
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,178
Just like that,

521
00:27:05,178 --> 00:27:06,560
you three are fighting?

522
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,706
You've becoming more like

523
00:27:08,706 --> 00:27:09,800
children as you grow up.

524
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,200
Grandmother, you said it right.

525
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,520
Fourth Sister

526
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,840
is more like a child now.

527
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,160
When she wants something,

528
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,080
she couldn't even wait for a moment

529
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,320
and had to immediately send out Yunzai

530
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,200
and the others to buy them.

531
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,840
If Yunzai gets delayed for a second in going out,

532
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,920
Fourth Sister will get mad.

533
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,240
That's right.

534
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,219
A few days ago,

535
00:27:27,219 --> 00:27:28,440
I saw Yunzai going out.

536
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,520
After calling her for several times,

537
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,880
she didn't even mind me.

538
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,200
She's becoming more and more unruly.

539
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:34,760
Fourth Sister,

540
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,727
if you don't know how to

541
00:27:35,727 --> 00:27:36,890
teach your servants to behave themselves,

542
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,640
you can give them to Sixth Sister

543
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,760
and me.

544
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,800
We'll teach her the rules on your behalf.

545
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,640
I've been locked up for several days.

546
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,440
I can't even send someone out to

547
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,080
buy things for me to relieve my boredom?

548
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,920
That Yunzai also just has a one-track mind.

549
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,103
After ordering her to go out

550
00:27:55,103 --> 00:27:55,840
and handle some business,

551
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,120
she's unable to care about other things.

552
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,222
Punishing her just

553
00:27:58,542 --> 00:27:59,680
because she didn't hear Fifth Sister calling her,

554
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,440
isn't that a bit too harsh?

555
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,440
Maybe Fifth Sister, you saw the wrong one?

556
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,842
Here in our house,

557
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,108
there are a few girls

558
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,280
who have the same height

559
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,760
and build as Yunzai.

560
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,840
What you said

561
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,480
is also reasonable.

562
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:19,160
Yunzai and Fourth Sister are similar too.

563
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,040
If they both

564
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,000
turn their back on me,

565
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,920
I indeed won't recognize any of them.

566
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,640
Fifth Sister,

567
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,040
the in-law of Eldest Sister

568
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,040
will be holding a banquet.

569
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,080
Shi is also six months old now

570
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,080
and can come out to see the guests.

571
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,320
Did you

572
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,160
prepare any gifts?

573
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,880
I've already prepared a gift for

574
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:42,720
my little nephew.

575
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,360
Since Fourth Sister is grounded,

576
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,800
she might not be able to go.

577
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,160
Who would like this?

578
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,720
I've contracted a cold lately

579
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,760
and am coughing a bit.

580
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:56,067
I fear that I might transfer

581
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:56,920
my illness to the child,

582
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,200
so I dare not go.

583
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,800
I've made a few baby undergarments.

584
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,880
Please give them on my behalf.

585
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,195
And as is the usual practice,

586
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,080
I've prepared a set for you.

587
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,240
Okay. I'll give them on your behalf.

588
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,280
This is so surprising.

589
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,497
How come

590
00:29:23,497 --> 00:29:24,360
you're raising these lotuses here?

591
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,000
Shouldn't these vats be placed

592
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,760
in the garden to be more impressive?

593
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,040
Putting them here

594
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,240
would only make this place crowded and moist.

595
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,240
So inconvenient.

596
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,840
I'm not doing it to grow flowers.

597
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,320
It's just that two months ago,

598
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,960
I burned some incense in Yuqing Monastery.

599
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,240
The Daoist priest there

600
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,240
made a prediction that

601
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,200
a disaster might happen to me this year.

602
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,680
I need water to extinguish the fire.

603
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,280
So I looked for three vats,

604
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:47,955
filled them with water,

605
00:29:47,955 --> 00:29:48,720
and placed them inside my room.

606
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,440
It might look like appreciating the flower

607
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,120
they are actually here to balance my fortune.

608
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,427
This way, my marriage fate

609
00:29:54,427 --> 00:29:55,240
would be smooth sailing.

610
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,760
A few days ago,

611
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,320
that Big Madam Wu from the House of

612
00:30:02,452 --> 00:30:04,480
Count Yongchang came here daily.

613
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,120
I saw you two getting along very well.

614
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,400
But these past days, you keep getting sick,

615
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,680
always locking yourself inside the house?

616
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,920
How can it still go smoothly?

617
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,480
Don't eventually end up

618
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,200
with a bingsheng

619
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,560
and live the rest of your life like that!

620
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:18,000
I know how lowly my status is.

621
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,880
Even if I enter the Count's house in the future,

622
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,320
I surely will just suffer.

623
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,040
Why bring trouble to myself?

624
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,640
Good thing you have self awareness.

625
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,840
Those people outside are saying

626
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,520
that you hooked up with Brother Yuanruo first,

627
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,720
and now hook up the House of Liang!

628
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,520
I think

629
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,579
they are just

630
00:30:35,579 --> 00:30:36,440
jealous of you

631
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,200
for getting benefit from the talent for jiju!

632
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,160
Fifth Sister, this is what you think?

633
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,240
Of course!

634
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,000
Those gossipers are just saying those things

635
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,360
because they are

636
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,440
envious of you.

637
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,776
Don't know how many times

638
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,124
they've played jiju with

639
00:30:49,144 --> 00:30:50,020
some Fourth Young Master Zhang

640
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,400
or Fourth Young Master Liu,

641
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,840
played how many sets of chuiwan?

642
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,080
Or perhaps

643
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:55,833
they are looking down at how low

644
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:56,760
the official position of our family is.

645
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,520
It's lucky that my Second Brother is an achiever.

646
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,548
Once he gets promoted to

647
00:31:00,548 --> 00:31:01,800
the leader of a bureau or ministry,

648
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,280
our family will surely be

649
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,400
more powerful than their houses.

650
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,120
This many?

651
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:15,760
Right.

652
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,920
Fifth Sister, you defended me.

653
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,720
I can't just

654
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,080
think about Eldest Sister, right?

655
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,809
You can choose whatever you like

656
00:31:21,809 --> 00:31:22,680
among these handkerchiefs.

657
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,000
I'm not really defending you.

658
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,040
Just because you were able to suppress that

659
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,560
little bitch Molan.

660
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,206
I've never seen her

661
00:31:31,206 --> 00:31:32,400
suffering so much.

662
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,040
The two of us can

663
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,360
be considered to be of the same house.

664
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,800
This handkerchief is so pretty.

665
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,480
So pretty.

666
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,360
Mother, look.

667
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,920
That Minglan is a weak and sickly girl,

668
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,360
always locking herself inside her room.

669
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,800
She was also unable

670
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,680
to entertain Big Madam Wu,

671
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,720
completely foiling this marriage.

672
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,640
She seemed to be having some new obsessions,

673
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,733
and started believing in

674
00:32:02,733 --> 00:32:03,640
that Maoshan Daoist priest.

675
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,040
She had several huge vats

676
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,120
transferred into her room.

677
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,800
She said that it can give her good luck

678
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,920
and a smooth-sailing marriage.

679
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,120
She indeed is younger than I am,

680
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,160
and not as clever.

681
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,950
She's more quick-witted than you are.

682
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,111
She knows to be worried about

683
00:32:19,111 --> 00:32:19,920
her marriage matters,

684
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,599
while you're still being silly here

685
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:22,480
and not giving it any thought.

686
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,720
I'm a legitimate daughter of the Sheng family,

687
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,240
and I'm doted on by you.

688
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,760
Why must I worry?

689
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:32,400
That's true,

690
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,960
but you have to worry about your marriage.

691
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,240
Now that your Eldest Sister

692
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,440
already have a son,

693
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:39,160
only your matter

694
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,760
is left to be handled.

695
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,840
We have to hurry a little.

696
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,880
I've never heard that Minglan

697
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,560
talking about believing in ghosts or deities,

698
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:47,040
but even she praised that Daoist priest.

699
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,680
He then must be really good!

700
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,880
I'll choose a good date

701
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,600
and go there to ask for some predictions too.

702
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,400
Are those Luzhong

703
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,760
and Yunzai of Linqi Pavilion?

704
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:24,560
Let's go look.

705
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,840
They might be doing some crooked means

706
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,640
to curse me.

707
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,840
Big Madam, please stay.

708
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,640
I'll go on your behalf.

709
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,800
Assist Big Madam to pray to the Sanxing.

710
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,200
I'll follow in a while.

711
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,400
I'm tired.

712
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,560
Let's have some tea before chatting.

713
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,320
It was actually Molan having a rendezvous?

714
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,520
Why did you catch them on the spot!

715
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,920
Big Madam,

716
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,880
have you not suffered enough

717
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,840
from their courtyard?

718
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,480
If we rashly go there,

719
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,000
isn't that alarming the enemy prematurely?

720
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,399
In front of Master,

721
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,760
you know very clearly about

722
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,040
their ability to dissuade him.

723
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,560
Each one acts to be so pitiful.

724
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,280
We are not their competition.

725
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,264
They can turn black into white,

726
00:35:37,264 --> 00:35:38,600
flat into round.

727
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,640
Maybe they will even pass the blame to you,

728
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,440
and we'll be the ones to suffer in the end!

729
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,880
This matter is so clear.

730
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,520
How can they still deny it?

731
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,640
We have to be sure.

732
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,760
Since we've caught their weakness,

733
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,240
then hold their neck tightly and not let go.

734
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,265
Don't let them have any chance

735
00:35:55,265 --> 00:35:56,080
to take in a breath!

736
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,520
I'm now very confused.

737
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,440
Tell me, what should we do?

738
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,347
Seeing how they were acting, I'm

739
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,720
sure that this isn't their first time meeting up.

740
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,400
Since they've tasted sweetness,

741
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,080
they surely won't easily stop.

742
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,520
There will be a next time.

743
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,120
Why don't

744
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,120
we go home and report this to the Master?

745
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,659
Let's ask him to personally come here

746
00:36:19,659 --> 00:36:20,600
and catch them red-handed.

747
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,880
This way,

748
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,740
the crime of her privately

749
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,600
meeting with a male outsider

750
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,840
and doing illicit acts

751
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:31,242
will be proven true,

752
00:36:31,242 --> 00:36:32,120
and they cannot deny it any more.

753
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,000
Say that once again!

754
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:47,080
Lower your voice.

755
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,680
Do you find this matter honorable?

756
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,240
That's impossible.

757
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,680
You must have seen it wrong.

758
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,640
Nanny Liu personally followed them.

759
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,000
She personally saw that

760
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,160
Molan having a rendezvous with Liang Han,

761
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,880
then they entered a room.

762
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,280
A man and a woman inside a secret room.

763
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,320
How could she see it wrongly?

764
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,920
I waited for them to leave.

765
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,760
When I entered the room,

766
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,000
there was a huge bed.

767
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,320
Nonsense!

768
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,920
How could you make up things to set people up?

769
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,575
You are completely slandering!

770
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,200
You suspect me of framing them?

771
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,640
Fine.

772
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,120
Seeing is better than hearing.

773
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,760
Minister, why don't you personally catch them red-handed

774
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,840
and the truth will be out.

775
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,760
Catching an affair is such an obscene act.

776
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,600
How could I—

777
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,680
How could you let a father

778
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,360
catch his own daughter...

779
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,120
Wait.

780
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,560
I think it's better that

781
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,000
I call Concubine Lin and Molan here.

782
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,440
You two...

783
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,560
You two confront each other.

784
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,000
If I'm telling any lies,

785
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,160
let Rulan never get married,

786
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,200
and Hualan never be able to raise her head high

787
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,160
in front of her in-laws!

788
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,345
My god...

789
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,560
Miss Luzhong!

790
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,480
Miss Luzhong,

791
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,040
are you going to buy hair oils

792
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,280
and rouge for Fourth Miss again?

793
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:31,760
I'm buying thread.

794
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,158
You must be going out

795
00:39:33,158 --> 00:39:34,000
with Miss Yunzai again, right?

796
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,040
Just keep your mouth shut.

797
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:39,691
Take the money

798
00:39:39,691 --> 00:39:40,720
and leave me alone.

799
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,640
A lowly guard like you privately talking about

800
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,800
matters of the Fourth Miss,

801
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,560
be careful of getting your spine hit.

802
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:48,960
I'm going now!

803
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,640
Big Madam!

804
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,360
Big Madam!

805
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,440
Big Madam,

806
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,502
she has left.

807
00:40:15,502 --> 00:40:16,320
She has gone out again.

808
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,960
Fourth Miss disguised as Yunzai

809
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,880
and went out with Luzhong again.

810
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,080
Hurry.

811
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,720
Inform the Minister and prepare the carriage.

812
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,480
Go to Yuqing Monastery.

813
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:36,680
Yes.

814
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,680
Tell the Minister

815
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,760
to bring servants who have signed a death contract

816
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,320
to tightly surround that courtyard.

817
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,520
Okay, I know.

818
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,280
We must not let them escape.

819
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:53,972
No!

820
00:40:53,972 --> 00:40:54,803
It's to guard that

821
00:40:54,803 --> 00:40:56,480
this matter doesn't get leaked out!

822
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,080
Because if it does,

823
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,280
the Misses of our house

824
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,520
won't be able to live anymore

825
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,400
and can only jump into the river!

826
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,680
Big Madam, you've thought about it thoroughly.

827
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:05,760
Let's go!
