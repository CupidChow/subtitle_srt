00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Ming Lan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,580
Episode 55

3
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,480
Marquis, recently,

4
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,300
you didn't go to morning court

5
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:42,720
if you're unhappy.

6
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,400
Was it really okay to keep doing that?

7
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,280
Just wipe the sword.

8
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:48,880
Okay.

9
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,720
Young Master.

10
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,960
It seems to be Young Master Sheng.

11
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,280
Quickly. Quickly. Turn to the other side.

12
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,440
Don't let him discover me.

13
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,440
Or else,

14
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,520
Or else, I'll get scolded badly.

15
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,800
Marquis, no use to hide.

16
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,800
It seems that he exactly came here for us.

17
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,480
He's coming.

18
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,960
Brother Changbai!

19
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,960
The rabbit is now cooked.

20
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,160
Come quickly and eat some.

21
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,360
What's wrong?

22
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,760
I wasn't attending the court these days.

23
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,440
You're not scolding me?

24
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,800
If there's really a problem,

25
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,040
there's no need to go to the court everyday.

26
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,160
It's cooked.

27
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,120
I knew it.

28
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,200
You heard that

29
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,040
I've gotten tea leaves from Yanran,

30
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,800
and came over here just to have some tea.

31
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,840
The tea of Madam Yu's house

32
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,280
can be considered one of the best.

33
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,840
Since you've gotten so many,

34
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,800
my drinking won't really make you run out of it.

35
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,920
I heard that she's about

36
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,800
to give birth.

37
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,840
Her child is almost 2 years old!

38
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,560
Poor memory.

39
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,680
I...

40
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,080
I am also pregnant.

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,840
Really?

42
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,440
Lower down your voice.

43
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,880
It's still not stable.

44
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,360
Just two months.

45
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,040
Then...

46
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,380
Then Duke of the State and his wife

47
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,800
surely are at ease now.

48
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,720
My father and mother

49
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,520
are indeed very happy,

50
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,840
but... now that I'm pregnant,

51
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,520
State Uncle...

52
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,920
State Uncle went to Little Zou's place now?

53
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,800
I'm quite clear about

54
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,240
how virtuous that last one is.

55
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,640
It's just that if that Little Zou

56
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,880
is easy to get along with,

57
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,080
our house would have been

58
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,120
peaceful and harmonious.

59
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,520
But she just have to do things

60
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,600
in an extreme manner.

61
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,700
Since time immemorial, giving birth

62
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,600
is pacing at the door of death.

63
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,440
Don't think too much then.

64
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,680
Just smoothly

65
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,280
deliver this child first.

66
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,800
After that, you'll have the idle time

67
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,880
to think about that.

68
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,000
That Sixth Little Sister of yours

69
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,120
is so heartless.

70
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,160
"Planting beans below the Nanshan Mountain,

71
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,200
The grasses are luscious,

72
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,560
but the bean seedlings are few."

73
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,240
A few days ago,

74
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,200
I told Shen Cong a story

75
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,120
for his pleasure,

76
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,000
telling him to love all his concubines equally.

77
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,600
His Little Zou

78
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,600
angrily charged at me to quarrel against me.

79
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,560
"A woman is like dodders or usnea plants,

80
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,800
willingly entrusting herself to a wooden bridge."

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,040
Other dodders or usnea

82
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,640
are very concerned about their husbands.

83
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,680
But your Sixth Sister is an exception.

84
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,560
I feel like that she's a bramble plant.

85
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,680
My auntie

86
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,920
casually stuffed a woman at us

87
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,880
to be her spy.

88
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,840
But she...

89
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,200
she's itching to even light firecrackers

90
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,080
in welcoming me a concubine!

91
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,925
“If you want to manage the state,

92
00:05:50,925 --> 00:05:52,160
manage your family first."

93
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,800
She asked me what I'm angry at.

94
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,280
How couldn't she,

95
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,280
such a smart person,

96
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,040
understand what I'm angry at?

97
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,680
She's just trying to

98
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,880
anger me to death!

99
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,440
"That far away Cowherd Star;

100
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,880
the bright Weaving Maid;

101
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,080
separated by a clear and shallow Milky Galaxy;

102
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,400
forever unable to talk to each other."

103
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,320
Can you stop reciting poems?

104
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,560
Tell me, whether I am right or not?

105
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,525
You two have been fighting

106
00:06:23,525 --> 00:06:24,360
like this for quite some time.

107
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,440
Aren't you bored already?

108
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,440
If you don't like something,

109
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,680
why don't you just

110
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,440
directly tell it to my Sixth Little Sister?

111
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,920
Why do you always beat around the bush,

112
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,960
covering up all your rears?

113
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,400
I'm a man.

114
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,560
When did I block my sides?

115
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,440
When did you block your sides?

116
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,325
What you're not doing

117
00:06:46,325 --> 00:06:47,680
is not just blocking your sides.

118
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,720
The story

119
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,680
that you told General Shen,

120
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,800
was actually your own frustration.

121
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,720
You were using that drink with him

122
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,680
to water the piled up earth in your heart!

123
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,640
No such thing.

124
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,520
You said that a concubine

125
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,360
seized the inner harem.

126
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,120
And then another urged

127
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,640
the husband to accept the princess as a wife.

128
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,400
But if you think it the other way around,

129
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,840
the first concubine was sincere.

130
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,720
She'd rather be a shrew,

131
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,080
than sharing her husband's love with others.

132
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,800
But the second one was faking her affection.

133
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,840
Just for her own safety,

134
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,760
she'd rather let his lover

135
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,040
to approach the princess.

136
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,000
Is it clever or slow-witted...

137
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,520
sincere or faking affection?

138
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,240
In this world,

139
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,000
how many people can really discern it?

140
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,575
You've already thought about things

141
00:07:53,575 --> 00:07:54,160
upto this point.

142
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,750
Then you should

143
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,480
talk with my Sixth Little Sister,

144
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,080
and lay down all your cards and make it clear.

145
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,840
Are you still the past Gu Second

146
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,120
who doesn't fear the heaven or earth,

147
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,720
and would just push through bravely?

148
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,840
With love, there comes worries.

149
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,960
With love, there comes fear.

150
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,600
If I open up the problem

151
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,560
clearly to her,

152
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,760
she surely will do things as my desire.

153
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,320
Then it will lose its meaning and interest.

154
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,960
You don't mention that to her.

155
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,720
"There's no real problem,

156
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,600
but worriers just make problems for themselves."

157
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,880
I hope that everything she does

158
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,480
would come from her sincerity.

159
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,360
I promised her

160
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,680
that I'll let her live a carefree life.

161
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,000
All these were only planned by you.

162
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,280
It has nothing to do with her.

163
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,120
It should be you

164
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,360
who decided on everything.

165
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,320
Yet you have to be mincing like this,

166
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,680
being so moody,

167
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,840
making her at a lost on what to do.

168
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,520
Currently, in this world,

169
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,600
the only person who dares

170
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,320
to say that I'm mincing

171
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,080
is you, Sheng Changbai.

172
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,400
It's burnt!

173
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,840
In a few months,

174
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,280
we can see another child.

175
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,360
Once the child is born,

176
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,280
I must hold her by my own

177
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,840
and make her some clothes.

178
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,600
Sister Zhang came earlier and said

179
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,880
that she's pregnant.

180
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,360
Really? Yes.

181
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,920
The ducal house would be

182
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,920
setting up a banquet then.

183
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,120
The palace should be more at ease now.

184
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,120
I remember that we have a Hunan fabric

185
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,360
with very soft texture.

186
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,200
It's perfect for making baby clothes.

187
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,440
The child is still in her womb.

188
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,840
Why are you rushing?

189
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,960
You just have no idea.

190
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,320
In making clothes for babies,

191
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,680
you must use the softest fabrics.

192
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,950
If you still want to embroider it,

193
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,000
it would be quite laborious.

194
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,240
You have to prepare beforehand.

195
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,040
Xiaotao, come to the stockroom with me.

196
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,240
Go and open the door,

197
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,200
and let's choose the fabric.

198
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,880
Big Madam,

199
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,120
you haven't eaten much for dinner.

200
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,480
Eat some pastries first before we go there.

201
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,080
Why didn't you have dinner?

202
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,720
Marquis didn't eat very much tonight.

203
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,960
Hence, he especially bought

204
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,920
some pig's hoofs from Fan House.

205
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,480
You can make

206
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,760
those sewing work anytime you want.

207
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,840
But if the pig's hoofs of Fan House gets cold,

208
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,040
it won't be delicious then.

209
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's already late at night.

210
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,160
How could I still eat pig's hoofs?

211
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,600
I'll just eat some flaky pastries.

212
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,080
Miss, I...

213
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,280
I think these pastries were overly cooked.

214
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,680
Let's go.

215
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,560
The pastries are overcooked, then eat pig's hoofs.

216
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,160
Others are having a baby,

217
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,520
but why are you

218
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,520
acting so happily then?

219
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,480
Once you're the one giving birth to a child,

220
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,800
you can be happy by then.

221
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,800
What's your business

222
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,480
if I have a child or not?

223
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,520
What's my business?

224
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,720
Why am I sitting here then?

225
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,080
To eat pig's hoofs.

226
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,040
What pig's hoofs?

227
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,880
The two of them

228
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,120
really make us worry.

229
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,600
How could Big Madam manage

230
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,480
if I'm not by her side?

231
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,960
This flaky pastry today is really delicious.

232
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
Of course!

233
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,480
This is personally

234
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,640
made by Big Madam.

235
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's not overcooked.

236
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,160
Yellow team scored!

237
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,170
Minglan really gives a good shot.

238
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,720
Yellow team wins!

239
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,280
The prize is...

240
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,240
an embroidered work with gold lining,

241
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,760
a pair of baby shoes!

242
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,360
That wife of our Second

243
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,160
can really torment people.

244
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,240
Lady Zhang of the ducal house of Ying,

245
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,840
a very precious lady,

246
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,720
who is even pregnant,

247
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,800
with a big belly,

248
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,880
was also dragged by her

249
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,760
to come in this muddy field.

250
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,320
If anything bad happens,

251
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,200
how would we explain it

252
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,000
to Duke Ying of the State?

253
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,880
Sister, just stop worrying.

254
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,120
They are both grown-ups

255
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,560
with conferred title to protect themselves.

256
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,840
They surely know

257
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,440
how to act within bounds.

258
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,640
If you ask me, Sister,

259
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,920
you're still a stepmother of them.

260
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,280
Although

261
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,960
your status isn't as noble as a birth mother,

262
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,600
you don't have to worry about the things

263
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,920
that a birth mother would worry about,

264
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,720
right?

265
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,720
Since we are all old now,

266
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,800
we should just be enjoying our lives.

267
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,400
That Miss Zhang is

268
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,320
a quite spirited one.

269
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,920
For all the ladies in the capital,

270
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,560
even if they don't give her respect,

271
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,720
they would surely

272
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,920
give Duchess Ying some respect.

273
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,575
A few days ago,

274
00:13:54,575 --> 00:13:56,280
in the banquet of Duke Wei of the State,

275
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,080
Duchess Wei kept pulling

276
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,480
kept pulling your Second daughter-in-law

277
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,880
and can't stop in her praises,

278
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,925
saying that she's sensible

279
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:03,120
and a good stewardess.

280
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,600
For people like the Duke and Duchess

281
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,240
who are with cold appearance,

282
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,680
yet they were

283
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,680
willingly praising your Second Daughter-in-law.

284
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,040
In my opinion,

285
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,360
Your Second-in-law came

286
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,000
from a small status family.

287
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,320
Her first banquet

288
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,480
got destroyed by the Zhang Family

289
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,640
and Zou Family.

290
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,520
To any extend,

291
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,400
she can't be

292
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,080
a somebody then.

293
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,000
You should just loosen your grip,

294
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,640
thus,

295
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,640
each of you could live a better life.

296
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,040
That's right.

297
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,960
As long as she loosens her grip,

298
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,480
everyone's life would be better.

299
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,560
Oh, I seemed to have soiled my dress.

300
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,440
I think

301
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,400
we should go back to the carriage

302
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,160
and change it.

303
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,560
That brat

304
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,400
initially had a hard time

305
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,800
getting along with other political families.

306
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,440
Other than winning the favor of Second,

307
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,920
she was never invited in any

308
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,800
family banquets.

309
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,200
This time, other than the ducal house of Ying,

310
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,080
she received the invitations of all

311
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,400
even including Duke Wei of the State's House.

312
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,600
In just a few months,

313
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,400
the wind direction has changed.

314
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,520
The Zhang family of Duke Ying of the State

315
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,040
is a pillar of the Empire.

316
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,600
And their daughter-in-law

317
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,040
is from a highly reputable family

318
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,080
of scholarly officials.

319
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,600
Now

320
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,120
that Second Madam was able to

321
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,720
win the good side of Miss Zhang,

322
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,560
the whole ducal house treats her as a benefactor.

323
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,480
How can other ducal houses not remember

324
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,280
to invite her?

325
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,920
She's now fully fledged.

326
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,600
The wind direction has also changed.

327
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,760
Second is also highly favored by the emperor.

328
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,360
I fear that...

329
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,120
our future days will be harder.

330
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,480
These past days,

331
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,680
we kept hitting the wall.

332
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,280
None of our plans

333
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,000
was successful.

334
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,320
Do you know why?

335
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,560
It's because the people from

336
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,000
that courtyard are too smart.

337
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,600
Smart?

338
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,360
There are so many smart people in this world

339
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,840
that have bowed their heads

340
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,880
to a bloody state.

341
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,400
Being smart won't work.

342
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
What's formidable about them is

343
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,080
that they are of one heart, relying on each other.

344
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,360
No matter how much we torment them,

345
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,960
they are like one iron plate.

346
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,880
Our greatest problem is

347
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,680
we can't harm their foundation.

348
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,320
Grand Madam, you have great insight.

349
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,160
There's no husband and wife in this world

350
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,280
that's really of one body.

351
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,200
Husbands would think that they control everything,

352
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,960
hence, they can become unfaithful

353
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,440
and develop other feelings to others.

354
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,200
They then mustn't blame their wives

355
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,225
from seeking her own survival path

356
00:16:49,225 --> 00:16:49,920
and undermine their husband.

357
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,600
All husbands and wives are like that.

358
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,840
How could they be

359
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,720
any different?

360
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,400
Since they are still newly wed,

361
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,100
it's just normal to still be

362
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,760
passionate about each other.

363
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,400
Let's slowly wait then.

364
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,680
I don't believe it.

365
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,440
They surely will show flaws sooner or later.

366
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,040
Heavily reward anyone from Cheng Garden

367
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,360
that can deliver us any news.

368
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:15,900
With a heavy reward,

369
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,160
there surely will be a brave soul.

370
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,000
I don't believe

371
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,920
that they are united like an iron plate.

372
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,000
Your Majesty.

373
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,920
You should

374
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,040
prioritize your health.

375
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,120
If you're unhealthy,

376
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,120
who

377
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,000
would this empire rely on?

378
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,600
The road ahead is so rough.

379
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,160
How can I stop?

380
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,225
Your Majesty, Your Highness,

381
00:18:05,225 --> 00:18:06,280
Prince Huan asks for an audience.

382
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,120
Our child is here.

383
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,040
Royal Father and Royal Mother,

384
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,920
I just got news that

385
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,640
Marquis Gu and his wife

386
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,920
organized another polo match,

387
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,880
and even invited uncle and auntie

388
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,440
to play.

389
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,640
Isn't that just a normal happening lately?

390
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,840
No need for you to happily come here

391
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,880
just to inform us, right?

392
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,280
Marquis Gu even had some drinks with uncle.

393
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,600
After the two of them had an earnest talk,

394
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,440
uncle felt a bit more relaxed,

395
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,160
and went back to rest in auntie's room again.

396
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:49,880
Really?

397
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,040
Yes.

398
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,440
Your uncle has been depressed for quite some time.

399
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,080
Even when his main wife got pregnant,

400
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,280
he didn't become happy.

401
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,280
Now, what make him feel relieved

402
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,120
is indeed good news.

403
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,400
General is the pillar of the empire.

404
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,675
The Zhang family is

405
00:19:11,675 --> 00:19:12,720
also the cornerstone of our state.

406
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,560
Now Madam Zhang is pregnant,

407
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,960
this means that we have lived up to

408
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,880
Duke Ying of the State.

409
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,120
I wasn't wrong in being

410
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,360
the matchmaker of this marriage.

411
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,880
Initially, I was puzzled

412
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,360
why Gu Second

413
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,825
would devotedly be in love

414
00:19:30,825 --> 00:19:32,080
with an illegitimate daughter.

415
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,720
From the looks of it now,

416
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,800
the two of them are evenly matched.

417
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,880
Both are not simple.

418
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,640
We should congratulate Your Majesty.

419
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,160
Congratulate me?

420
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,480
Congratulations for having profound good fortune

421
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,360
that the elite talents of the empire

422
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,880
have become your trusted subjects.

423
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,440
It isn't my fortune

424
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,160
that's profound.

425
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,160
It's all thanks to our Prince Huan

426
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,720
for knowing who to befriend.

427
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,240
It's our Prince Huan's blessings

428
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,760
that's profound.

429
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,160
Royal Father,

430
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,040
I can't bear such words from you.

431
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,680
Why are you kneeling? Get up.

432
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,000
Get up.

433
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,560
Sit down and tell me,

434
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,920
what other interesting stories

435
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,240
are still there outside?

436
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,160
Sister Zhang's complexion looks good.

437
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,240
Duke Ying of the State is also a lot happier now.

438
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,160
Why are you laughing?

439
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,920
Now you know

440
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,120
why

441
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,320
Brother Shen and Empress

442
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,240
put so much importance on Little Zou.

443
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,975
The one who sacrificed her life

444
00:20:48,975 --> 00:20:49,560
to save the empress

445
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,720
is a Zou lady after all.

446
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,760
I know that.

447
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,720
Sister-in-law Zou

448
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,120
was really magnanimous.

449
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,720
So many men can't even compare to her.

450
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,960
Brother Shen before was also very resolute

451
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,560
and steadfast.

452
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,725
The two of them mutually helped each other

453
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:09,480
during dire circumstances,

454
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,440
and were the envy of everyone.

455
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,520
I've never seen a husband and wife

456
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,480
like them.

457
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,640
I also was never fortunate to have met one.

458
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,240
After the situation here was stabilized,

459
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,160
Brother Shen returned to Yuzhou to fetch her.

460
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,680
Only then did he learn

461
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,520
that Sister-in-law Zou has died.

462
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,120
Since then,

463
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,000
he totally

464
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,280
changed to another person.

465
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,600
It was all because he risked his life

466
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,320
to save the emperor.

467
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:43,960
It's so easy

468
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,480
to say those words,

469
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,440
but each stroke of those words

470
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,000
are made of human lives.

471
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,680
Brother Shen's body

472
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,520
was full of wounds.

473
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,520
Brother Xiao Zhong lost his second little brother

474
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,040
and nephew.

475
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,800
Xiao Geng, fought bravely and got blood soaked.

476
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,120
He almost

477
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,000
lost an arm and a leg.

478
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,000
What about you?

479
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,600
Me?

480
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,080
Don't you clearly know already

481
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,520
what wounds I have in my body?

482
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:19,910
I'm seriously asking.

483
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,960
What I told you is my serious answer.

484
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,280
Look at those officials and nobility

485
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,520
in the capital.

486
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,600
They think that saying a few words

487
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,600
and shedding a few tears

488
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,080
is already being loyal.

489
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,600
Inside them are twisted roots

490
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,480
and intertwined joints.

491
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,840
No one really knows

492
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,680
what they are thinking about.

493
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,120
They are unlike us.

494
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,480
Although Xiao Geng kept committing mistakes,

495
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,240
Old Shen's house isn't that peaceful,

496
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,440
our loyalty were piled from mountains

497
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,280
of blades and seas of blood.

498
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,640
Can it be the same with them?

499
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,040
Yes.

500
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,920
If Empress died,

501
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,080
the worries of the Zou family

502
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,880
would have become the worries of the Shen family.

503
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,680
Sister-in-law Zou

504
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,720
had indeed always

505
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,450
placed the welfare of his husband's family

506
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:06,840
above everything else.

507
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,520
My wife,

508
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,440
in this world, not many women

509
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,760
can understand it as clearly as that like you did.

510
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,440
I indeed understood it clearly,

511
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,680
but easily becomes dreary.

512
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,880
Do you feel that Brother Shen

513
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,120
is irresolute and weak for continuously defending

514
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,040
that concubine of his,

515
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,760
hence, his family wasn't harmonious?

516
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,480
Not really irresolute.

517
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,880
Of course,

518
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,875
State Uncle knows that whether

519
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:44,080
it's his main wife or his concubine,

520
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,160
if they continue to fight like that,

521
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,560
everyone won't have any good days.

522
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,320
As long as those two women

523
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,560
don't fight right under his eyes,

524
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,160
he was willing to pretend

525
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,560
that everything was fine,

526
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,680
to be spared from the trouble.

527
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,040
While we are alive,

528
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,080
the problems and pains of other people

529
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,200
will of course

530
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,200
be not as important

531
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,960
as our own happiness.

532
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,440
If you encounter

533
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,560
such a heartbreaking problem,

534
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,560
what will you do?

535
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,880
When you get hurt, it will eventually heal.

536
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,520
You surely can endure it.

537
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,000
What if it can't heal?

538
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,120
It will.

539
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,640
Is there any matter that's upsetting you?

540
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,560
I can't remember

541
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,800
the face of my mother anymore,

542
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,520
but I was able to live through it.

543
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,720
If this matter happens to you,

544
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,040
what will you do?

545
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,160
I don't know.

546
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,000
Let's just talk about it when it happens.

547
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,440
Anyway, I won't commit suicide.

548
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,000
Really?

549
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,160
You...

550
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,680
Although I'm relying on you to live my days,

551
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,520
if you really have a change of heart,

552
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,000
what can I do?

553
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,040
Do you want me to ready the arrows in the bows,

554
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,240
hold a chopping knife on each hand,

555
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,520
place one on your neck

556
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,560
and the other on mine?

557
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,800
What about living our days like that?

558
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,320
You...are readying

559
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,160
your retreat path!

560
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,440
We have just been married not long ago

561
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,640
and you're already preparing your retreat path.

562
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,520
You...are

563
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,960
so heartless and ungrateful!

564
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:41,880
I...

565
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,560
Marquis,

566
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,400
how much wine did you take?

567
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,800
Are you muddled from being drunk?

568
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,040
I'm not muddled.

569
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:50,920
Let me ask you,

570
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,720
if you're allowed to choose again,

571
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,120
will you still marry me?

572
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,520
What?

573
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,640
If you're allowed

574
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,400
to choose again,

575
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,800
would you marry Yuanruo?

576
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,075
I...

577
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,200
Young Lord Qi and I have always behaved

578
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,440
according to proper rules.

579
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,560
We have never exceeded our bounds.

580
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,160
You know about

581
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,920
our matter from start to finish!

582
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,360
If you can't get past it,

583
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,480
why did you marry me then?!

584
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,520
I know!

585
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,825
I know everything that happened

586
00:26:19,825 --> 00:26:20,600
between the two of you!

587
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,875
But isn't a man's heart always in discontent

588
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:22,560
like a snake which tries to swallow an elephant?

589
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,680
Tell me.

590
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,720
When you intervened in my matter with Yuanruo,

591
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,960
did you do it

592
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,040
for me or for him?

593
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,560
Of course, it's for you!

594
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,000
You told him

595
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,760
that he shouldn't get involved in the conflict

596
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,120
between His Majesty and Empress Dowager.

597
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,840
You told him that in the morning court,

598
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,280
"a moment of silence..."

599
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,175
"A moment of silence is better

600
00:26:41,175 --> 00:26:41,960
than an eloquent speech!"

601
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,600
Right!

602
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,080
You told him that in the morning court,

603
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,025
"a moment of silence is better

604
00:26:45,025 --> 00:26:45,760
than an eloquent speech."

605
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,480
You told an outsider

606
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,440
words like that,

607
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,300
but how come you didn't know

608
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,580
your husband?

609
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,440
Wasn't I just thinking of ways

610
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,680
for him to stop tripping you

611
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,080
during the court meetings.

612
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:54,880
Moreover,

613
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,480
you are the trusted aide of His Majesty.

614
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,040
You even help His Majesty

615
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,360
get the jade seal back from Empress Dowager.

616
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,240
What...

617
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,680
Whatever...a moment...

618
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,400
a moment of silence is better

619
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,400
than an eloquent speech that you do,

620
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,080
would Empress Dowager believe it?

621
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,840
Do you hate me so much right now?

622
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,440
Do you hate me

623
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,160
for going around in such

624
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,240
a huge circle just to marry you?

625
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,560
I want you to hate me,

626
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,880
but also afraid that you'll do.

627
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,280
You're drunk.

628
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,160
I'm not!

629
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,040
I'm drunk!

630
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,320
I've long been drunk!

631
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,400
I feel that I'm drunk

632
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,280
since the time

633
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,160
I saved you from the waters.

634
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,920
since the time I saved you from the waters.

635
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,400
I know about your matter with Qi,

636
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,520
and your matter with He.

637
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,760
All these...stop that.

638
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,000
I know about all of them.

639
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,840
What do you really know?

640
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,160
I just want you to care for me.

641
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:51,840
Why aren't you

642
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,560
giving me any importance?

643
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,280
You don't give me any importance!

644
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:55,920
Tell me,

645
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,560
Marquis!

646
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,000
I just want to marry you.

647
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,760
Marquis! Marquis! Marquis!

648
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,240
That's Big Madam! Marquis!

649
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,640
Marquis! Marquis! That's Big Madam!

650
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,280
You're drunk.

651
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:02,880
Let's just talk once you've figured things out.

652
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,000
Big Madam and I...

653
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,560
Why must you meddle?

654
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,240
Marquis! Marquis! Marquis!

655
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,840
How come you can't understand me?

656
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,920
Am I the one who's drunk or it's you?

657
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,920
Pull him away!

658
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,440
Marquis! Marquis!

659
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,960
I'm not getting on the carriage.

660
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,240
Let's go!

661
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,440
Miss.

662
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,480
Marquis.

663
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,200
I won't ride the same carriage with her.

664
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,160
Okay. We're not getting in the carriage.

665
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,520
Go back to the manor!

666
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,640
Go back to the manor!

667
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,000
Fengxian saw it very clearly.

668
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,480
He indeed moved to the study to sleep.

669
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,640
He has been sleeping there for 5 to 6 days now.

670
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,520
They looked so sweet like honey,

671
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,960
but they've actually been sleeping separately now?

672
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,680
A few days ago, the two of them

673
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,360
went to the house of State Uncle together.

674
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,880
On their way back,

675
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,080
they had a fight.

676
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,400
That night,

677
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,840
Marquis moved his clothes and blankets

678
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,880
out of the room.

679
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,200
He also didn't try to hide it from anyone.

680
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,040
I even had to bribe the

681
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,880
carriage driver that day a land title

682
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,240
for him to tell me this.

683
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,640
Did he go to Fengxian's room?

684
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,760
He never did.

685
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,200
This can't be helped.

686
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,960
That Fengxian has such ordinary look.

687
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,600
It's too far

688
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,440
from the beauty of Second's wife.

689
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,280
Isn't that one

690
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,640
from the House of Kang coming today?

691
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,440
She's already outside waiting.

692
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,040
Let's go and take a look

693
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,400
what tricks she has up her sleeves.

694
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,680
This way.

695
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,560
Miss Xiaotao.

696
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,160
Tao'er!

697
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,160
Tao'er!

698
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,680
Don't follow me!

699
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,240
Xiaotao,

700
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,520
why are you moving farther the more I call you?

701
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,320
Here.

702
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,000
Xiaotao!

703
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,720
What?

704
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,080
What's going on? Who's sick?

705
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,120
It's none of your business whoever is sick.

706
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,000
Big Madam is sick?

707
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,480
Even if she isn't, she would be out of anger.

708
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,360
Get lost.

709
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,120
Oh, no!

710
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,960
Marquis! Marquis! Marquis!

711
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,120
Marquis.

712
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,480
I saw Xiaotao earlier

713
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,960
leading a doctor to the back courtyard.

714
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,240
I fear that Big Madam maybe sick.

715
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,000
What?! Yes.

716
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,360
Servant!

717
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:53,960
Marquis.

718
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,480
Big Madam is sick?

719
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,040
She's been sick for 1 to 2 days.

720
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,440
What's going on?

721
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,500
I heard that there is incoordination

722
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,160
between her spleen and stomach,

723
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,360
that she couldn't eat anything.

724
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,080
How come no one told me?

725
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,000
It was Madam who told us not to spread the news.

726
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,720
Marquis, you also didn't ask.

727
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,920
Marquis, we're not going to check?

728
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,280
Let the doctor examine her first.

729
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,080
Once the doctor is done checking her,

730
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,720
make him come see me for questioning.

731
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,600
Okay.

732
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,000
Regarding that marriage prospect

733
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,200
that I've been seeking out for you,

734
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,200
Nanny Cui told me

735
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,360
about it yesterday.

736
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,120
She has already clearly investigated

737
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,280
the nephew of your paternal uncle-in-law,

738
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,920
that one you called eldest cousin.

739
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,760
Madam, what nonsense are you saying?

740
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,040
Just quickly call the doctor to examine you.

741
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,520
Why?

742
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,360
My mind is very clear about this right now.

743
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,440
Don't involve the doctor in this.

744
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,600
I'm not marrying!

745
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,280
I want to

746
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,360
accompany you here forever.

747
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:31,800
Even if you kneel,

748
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,720
you must hear me finish my words.

749
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,520
Nanny Cui

750
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,560
exerted a lot of efforts

751
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,520
just for this marriage of yours.

752
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,000
Okay. Okay.

753
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,440
She did it for me.

754
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,640
As a main madam,

755
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,640
you're so shameless.

756
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,920
I won't kneel anymore!

757
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,000
I'll say it for Xiaotao then.

758
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,475
I was indeed waiting for you

759
00:33:01,475 --> 00:33:02,400
to continue the story.

760
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,960
Nanny Cui said that

761
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,520
Danju's cousin is so capable.

762
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,080
He's able to

763
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,600
take care of the farmstead and shops.

764
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,760
The main family situation is quite simple

765
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,120
and are mostly even related by blood.

766
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,040
Nanny Cui even

767
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,000
asked the nearby neighbors

768
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,080
and they said

769
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,880
that this family is quite reasonable and fair.

770
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,000
This...even if that man's family seems to be good,

771
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,275
we still can't marry

772
00:33:29,275 --> 00:33:31,080
in a blind and deaf manner, right?

773
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,160
Danju's cousin is older than her by 4 years.

774
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,120
Logically speaking,

775
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,880
he should have married long ago.

776
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,280
How come

777
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,600
he delayed it until now?

778
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,440
Guess what the reason is.

779
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,325
I'm guessing that

780
00:33:49,325 --> 00:33:50,400
he probably is as ugly as Shitou,

781
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,760
hence, no one wants him.

782
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,560
It's as if you haven't seen my cousin!

783
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:56,800
Ugly? No.

784
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,800
That's right.

785
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,480
Look at how able-bodied

786
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,960
that young lad was.

787
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,040
He waited for you to be available

788
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,080
before he talks about marriage.

789
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,440
He waited for so many years,

790
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,575
that his parents couldn't even

791
00:34:06,575 --> 00:34:07,200
convince him otherwise.

792
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,440
It was really not easy.

793
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,320
It's because when I was little,

794
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,280
when I stayed in my paternal aunt's house,

795
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,920
my cousin came as a guest

796
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,480
and treated me very well.

797
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,600
It's settled then!

798
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,600
What to settle down?!

799
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,600
Your parents are now both dead.

800
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,960
I think

801
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,120
we should just let your uncle-in-law and auntie

802
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,160
marry you off on their behalf.

803
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,000
Asking the name, engaging the ceremony

804
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
and betrothal gifts...

805
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,680
I'll give you

806
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,760
a very gracious dowry

807
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,200
and marry you off in a grand manner.

808
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,560
Big Madam,

809
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,360
what muddle words are you saying?

810
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,480
You didn't disappoint me,

811
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,880
so I mustn't disappoint you.

812
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,000
You can also see the days

813
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,320
we have here in the marquis manor.

814
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,120
Although in marriage,

815
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,960
wealth and assets are indeed important,

816
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,400
it's more important

817
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,200
to look for someone

818
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,520
who is sensible and reasonable.

819
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,480
With the gratitude and loyalty between us,

820
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,920
being able to see

821
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,400
you living a beautiful and harmonious life

822
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,680
is also the right path.

823
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:43,080
Miss, I don't want to leave you!

824
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,320
I can't really

825
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,680
bind you to my side forever

826
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,040
just because

827
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,040
you served me

828
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,200
very well.

829
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,920
In life,

830
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,920
there isn't a banquet that won't end.

831
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:15,960
Being able to see you,

832
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,440
living the rest of your life happily

833
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,960
is also kind of gratitude and loyalty between us.

834
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,000
Miss!

835
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,680
I don't want to leave!

836
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,680
Marquis.

837
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,840
What about it? Where's the doctor?

838
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,475
The doctor didn't examine her

839
00:36:43,475 --> 00:36:44,240
and just waited outside.

840
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,760
Big Madam sent words

841
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,920
that her illness isn't that grave.

842
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,240
The servants are just exaggerating.

843
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,120
She then give him some money

844
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,160
and sent him away.

845
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,760
What did Xiaotao say?

846
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:58,720
This...

847
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,800
How would I know?

848
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,320
Don't think

849
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,480
I don't know that you're wooing her!

850
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,320
Quickly say it. What did she say?

851
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,200
Marquis.

852
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,200
Not that I'm complaining.

853
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,880
Xiaotao has changed.

854
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,960
She refuses to talk to me.

855
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,760
You're blaming me then?

856
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,960
I dare not.

857
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:20,960
I just want to ask you when you're returning

858
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,600
to sleep in the main room.

859
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,920
And look at this study,

860
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,840
there are so many spaces for wind to enter.

861
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,400
Didn't we also rest here for a few days,

862
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,280
but you never slept soundly.

863
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,360
We're not going back.

864
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,720
You're not going to check on Big Madam?

865
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,160
I went to the kitchen earlier.

866
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,160
These past days, they haven't been making

867
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,680
the favorite cold pork knuckle

868
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,640
in jelly dish for Big Madam lately.

869
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,120
What about fish soup?

870
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,240
They haven't been making that too.

871
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,320
They would just make some snowball cake.

872
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,840
Big Madam didn't like eating those before.

873
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,280
The kitchen is under her jurisdiction.

874
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,480
She can eat whatever she likes!

875
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,680
Marquis, I especially made you some sweet drinks.

876
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,160
Just put it there and leave.

877
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,040
Yes.

878
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,080
Marquis,

879
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,900
Prime Minister Han sent someone

880
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,520
to relay a message that

881
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,080
he'll be waiting for you in the ancestral hall

882
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:39,800
in the adjacent house.

883
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,680
I heard

884
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,560
that your mother has died a long time ago.

885
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,400
Yes.

886
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,880
Has she been conferred a title?

887
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,520
Thank you to His Majesty's graces,

888
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,840
she already has been conferred a posthumous title.

889
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,480
Among human relationships,

890
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,720
nothing beats our debt of gratitude to our parents

891
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,840
for giving birth to us and raising us.

892
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,240
Now that His Majesty is the emperor,

893
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,680
the status of his birth parents

894
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,360
still have not been decided upon.

895
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,440
He's worse than you.

896
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,080
A goat would kneel to his mother upon birth.

897
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,400
They are indeed better than humans.

898
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:40,850
Prime Minister submitted

899
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:41,680
this memorial to His Majesty,

900
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:42,825
and didn't he already asked

901
00:39:42,825 --> 00:39:43,280
the Office of Imperial Sacrifices,

902
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,000
under the Ministry of Rites,

903
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,150
to discuss the title to be conferred

904
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,000
to the deceased Prince Shu?

905
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,080
Minister Fan of the Office of Imperial Sacrifices

906
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,040
didn't go through the palace secretariat

907
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,760
and directly submitted a report to His Majesty

908
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,275
that Prince Shu mustn't be

909
00:39:55,275 --> 00:39:56,960
given a posthumous title.

910
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,200
Before His Majesty ascended to the throne,

911
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,800
you and Minister Fan were the ones

912
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,960
who are actively supporting him.

913
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,760
Now that Minister Fan has changed his stand,

914
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,960
I fear that this matter won't be that easy to do.

915
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,720
It wasn't easy to take back the jade seal,

916
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,120
but we were able to do it.

917
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:15,950
No matter how hard it is to get this

918
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,040
posthumous title, we must continue lobbying it.

919
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:23,920
How about this?

920
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,960
Once Prince Huan, General Duan,

921
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,720
and General Geng are back,

922
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,560
let's discuss this further.

923
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,880
Why do you think

924
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,240
Prince Huan brought General Duan

925
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,840
and General Geng

926
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,200
to inspect the Western Military Camp,

927
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,560
and deliberately left you

928
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,680
and General Shen behind?

929
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,075
Among the hundreds of kindness,

930
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:53,790
filial piety takes top priority.

931
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,300
Now that Your Majesty is

932
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,480
occupying an important position

933
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,760
and is already the respected emperor,

934
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,600
you should finalize the posthumous title

935
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,280
of the deceased Prince Shu.

936
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,520
Prime Minister Han,

937
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,640
what title do you want to talk about?

938
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,250
The deceased Prince Shu is

939
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,640
the brother of the former emperor,

940
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,840
the father of His Majesty.

941
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,800
His Majesty should address him

942
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,360
as Royal Father.

943
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:29,360
His Majesty was adopted under the bloodline of the former emperor,

944
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,720
hence, he was able to inherit the throne.

945
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,600
It's just right that he treats

946
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,720
the former emperor as his father.

947
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,360
Prince Shu is the birth father of His Majesty.

948
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,120
He is the descendant of his bloodline.

949
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,875
If His Majesty, upon obtaining

950
00:41:40,875 --> 00:41:41,920
the imperial throne,

951
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,520
will start to address him otherwise,

952
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,280
the citizen would then be criticizing His Majesty

953
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,920
as being heartless and unfilial.

954
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,240
Looks like Prime Minister Han

955
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,440
is set on pushing for this matter.

956
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,120
Other subjects,

957
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,560
what are your opinions?

958
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,560
I agree with Han Zhang.

959
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,360
Okay.

960
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,200
Okay.

961
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,200
The two ministers seem to

962
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,320
have discussed it already with His Majesty.

963
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,120
You are here to bully a widow like me.

964
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,760
Empress Dowager, you said it so seriously.

965
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,760
I only have respect for you

966
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,520
and no rebellious intentions.

967
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,600
Why don't we...

968
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,640
just ask...

969
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,560
the other subjects?

970
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,520
The high ministers have all discussed this.

971
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,320
Marquis Gu,

972
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,180
you are a military official

973
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,600
and is well-versed in scholarly knowledge.

974
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,960
What is your opinion about this matter?

975
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,400
Replying to Your Majesty,

976
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,300
I lost my mother at a young age

977
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,520
and was left without a support.

978
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,320
Of course,

979
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,725
I naturally would feel that nothing

980
00:43:08,725 --> 00:43:09,760
is better than having a birth mother.

981
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,400
Just flower words to flatter others.

982
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,025
You are just saying flowery words

983
00:43:14,025 --> 00:43:14,820
to flatter other people!

984
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,960
Marquis Gu experienced it personally

985
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,360
and was very reasonable.

986
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,975
I, Qi Heng from the Remonstrance Bureau,

987
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:23,720
has something to say.

988
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,320
Grand Master of Remonstrance, please talk.

989
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,600
The former emperor thought about

990
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,080
the heavy burden of governing this empire

991
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,880
and the mandate of the heaven,

992
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,225
before finally choosing His Majesty

993
00:43:40,225 --> 00:43:41,120
among the imperial relatives

994
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,080
to succeed this grand undertaking.

995
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,575
His Majesty was close to

996
00:43:43,575 --> 00:43:44,800
the former emperor like a son,

997
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,480
and then became the heir of his uncle

998
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,560
in bringing prosperity to the empire.

999
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,300
They say that you should consider the people

1000
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,600
that adopted you as your parents.

1001
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,080
The place where you come from as your kins.

1002
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,960
That's how it is among the citizens.

1003
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,520
How could the imperial family

1004
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,400
go against it?

1005
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,900
If His Majesty addresses

1006
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,720
the former emperor as Royal Father,

1007
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,840
how should he address Prince Shu then?

1008
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:13,750
The former emperor is

1009
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:15,520
the adoptive father of His Majesty,

1010
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,160
hence, he's addressed as Royal Father.

1011
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,040
Prince Shu is the brother of the former emperor.

1012
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,360
His Majesty can call him...

1013
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,640
Royal Uncle.

1014
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,120
Prince Shu is the birth father of His Majesty.

1015
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,300
Lord Qi is asking His Majesty

1016
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,360
to call

1017
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,280
his birth father as Royal Uncle.

1018
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,400
Was a previous example been present in this world?

1019
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,250
As they say, the command of the eldest

1020
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:45,880
legitimate heir should be respected.

1021
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,300
His Majesty has already inherited

1022
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:48,000
become the eldest legitimate heir,

1023
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,320
and has now obtained the throne.

1024
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:50,650
Even if the gratuitous debt of giving life

1025
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:51,080
is as deep as the sea,

1026
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,025
it isn't enough to overshadow the virtue

1027
00:44:52,025 --> 00:44:52,800
of the past emperor in adopting you.

1028
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,350
How could you disregard

1029
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:53,944
the eldest legitimate child

1030
00:44:53,944 --> 00:44:55,080
and instead care about the illegitimate sons?

1031
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,080
Marquis Gu,

1032
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,600
this is making His Majesty not righteous.

1033
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,600
You owe a debt of gratitude to your birth parents,

1034
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,080
and must show loyalty to your adoptive parents.

1035
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,040
If His Majesty is biased,

1036
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,760
doesn't that also make him unjust?

1037
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:07,760
Shut up!

1038
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,320
Men!

1039
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,675
Drag this scoundrel

1040
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:13,400
who's not putting any importance

1041
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,560
to the emperor or to his father out

1042
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,160
and cane him twenty times!
