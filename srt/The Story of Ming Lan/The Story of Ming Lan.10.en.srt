00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Episode 10

3
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:05,360
Flower arrangement is a very deep

4
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,800
and refined art form.

5
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,559
Even though I've worked for decades in the palace,

6
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,760
I have only a superficial understanding.

7
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,440
I can only be

8
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,440
your guide.

9
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:18,120
Flower arrangement places emphasis on external form

10
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,199
and inspirations from the heart.

11
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,319
Not only does it need to be beautiful

12
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,400
but more importantly, it needs to be interesting.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,080
If you can also illustrate some point of philosophy

14
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,959
then it will be transcendental.

15
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,199
Misses, you'll need to study and comprehend

16
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:32,839
the abstruse philosophies and mastery

17
00:01:33,199 --> 00:01:34,599
involved by yourselves.

18
00:01:36,559 --> 00:01:38,239
Give it a try yourselves first.

19
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,559
The form is rather graceful,

20
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,720
but the color combination is inadequate.

21
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,759
Nanny, please show me.

22
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,320
Color combinations can be heavy and rich

23
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,119
or light and elegant,

24
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,039
be cold or warm,

25
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:37,000
be complementary,

26
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,759
or one main and the other supplementary.

27
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,600
Your arrangement, Miss,

28
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,759
doesn't have any point to draw people's attention.

29
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,000
Yes, it is light,

30
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,440
but there is no elegance.

31
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,240
What if I put in this one?

32
00:02:52,279 --> 00:02:53,919
This one is colorful enough,

33
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,800
but glaring so.

34
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:58,160
Give it a bit more consideration, Miss.

35
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,279
Momo!

36
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,080
Nanny,

37
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:05,279
how about I switch it to these?

38
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,240
These flowers are already very pale in color,

39
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,639
if you switch in this light purple,

40
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,880
it will be even paler and colder.

41
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:15,240
Nanny…

42
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,320
Nanny,

43
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,639
what about this crimson one?

44
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,880
The color is bright and eye-catching.

45
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,320
If I were you,

46
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:28,360
I would choose these two bright yellow ones.

47
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,520
Try it.

48
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,160
Put it here.

49
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,240
Yes indeed,

50
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:39,160
it's the final touch required, Nanny Kong.

51
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,320
Once the bright yellow flowers were added,

52
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:42,559
all the flowers in the vase

53
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,520
seemed to come to life,

54
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:44,919
without losing the light and elegant feel.

55
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,399
How didn't I think it so?

56
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:48,279
No need to rush, Miss.

57
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,720
You have just started

58
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,320
and have already made much progress.

59
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:53,160
It is very good already.

60
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,720
Then Nanny,

61
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,240
you must swiftly teach us,

62
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,800
how to match it to our clothes

63
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,559
and to people's dispositions?

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,559
I

65
00:04:01,559 --> 00:04:03,240
have talked much today

66
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:05,679
and my throat's a bit dry.

67
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:07,240
I need to return to my room

68
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,720
and drink something soothing.

69
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,399
Misses,

70
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,800
continue with your work.

71
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:12,479
No need for obeisance.

72
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:15,199
I'll be back shortly.

73
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:16,920
Please take your time.

74
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,119
Please take your time Nanny Kong.

75
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:47,679
Fourth Sister,

76
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:49,119
you are certainly putting in a lot of efforts!

77
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,760
You don't put efforts into ladies' arts

78
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,440
like weaving and embroidery,

79
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,760
instead you focus on incense preparation,

80
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,760
flower arrangement,

81
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:57,399
and things that noble

82
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,399
and prestigious families like.

83
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,239
It's as if

84
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,679
you will have need of such knowledge in the future.

85
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:03,279
As Nanny Kong said

86
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,720
while such skills were trivial,

87
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,799
it was better to know it and not use it,

88
00:05:07,799 --> 00:05:09,839
than be ignorant and a laughing-stock.

89
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:12,279
I've always been obtuse,

90
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,839
but I don't want to

91
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,119
lose face for the family,

92
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,440
so naturally I must clarify things

93
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,839
I'm unsure about.

94
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:21,040
Fourth Sister, if you know you're obtuse,

95
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,559
then you should be more sensible!

96
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,959
Don't constantly

97
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,200
hog Nanny Kong's time.

98
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,600
Can't you tell

99
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,640
the old lady doesn't

100
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,119
want to bother with you?

101
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,160
That's why she lied about

102
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,880
going back to her room for medicine.

103
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:32,600
It's so that she can avoid you.

104
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,880
When have I hogged Nanny Kong?

105
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,160
It's because Father told me

106
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,000
to study diligently with Nanny Kong.

107
00:05:39,359 --> 00:05:41,119
He will test me on everything later on.

108
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,160
I dare not disobey.

109
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:43,880
So why can't I ask a few questions about

110
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,440
what I don't understand?

111
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,200
Stop always pressing me with Father!

112
00:05:48,559 --> 00:05:51,040
Nanny Kong was specially invited here

113
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,799
for Sixth Sister and I.

114
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,440
We are

115
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,119
her actual students.

116
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:58,799
You? You were forcibly stuffed in here.

117
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,559
You got an advantage and you flaunted it.

118
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,320
You really

119
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,640
did learn some low maneuvers.

120
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,200
You see someone with something nice,

121
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,480
you snatch it and once you've got it,

122
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,359
you whine about how it's unfair to you.

123
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,119
What are you talking about, Fifth Sister?

124
00:06:12,679 --> 00:06:13,880
What do you mean by "low maneuvers"?

125
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,279
What is "snatched from others"?

126
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,839
We were all born to the same father.

127
00:06:18,119 --> 00:06:19,880
Why both of you can learn it, but I can't?

128
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:22,040
You're just bullying me because I am a concubine-born.

129
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,559
Fine, fine, fine.

130
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:25,519
I am just an extra.

131
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,880
Why bother being born into this world

132
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,959
and be an eye-sore?

133
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,959
I'll just die instead!

134
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,519
Crying, and crying, and crying again!

135
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,040
Every little thing happens,

136
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,119
and you act like you're in mourning.

137
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,640
Faking it again.

138
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:45,440
Why do you always cry

139
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,040
like your own mother has died?

140
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:49,359
Last time it was clearly you who struck a blow at me,

141
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,239
but you faked your crying

142
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,480
before Father and caused him to punish me.

143
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:55,160
What are you trying to get out this time?

144
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,119
Are you just

145
00:06:56,119 --> 00:06:57,399
trying to have the Nanny

146
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,559
see it and deem that I'm bullying you

147
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,559
to get Father to punish me again?

148
00:07:13,359 --> 00:07:15,320
Fourth Sister, please stop crying.

149
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,720
Fifth Sister, you speak a few sentences less too.

150
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,279
If Nanny Kong hear it,

151
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,600
she will think our Sheng daughters

152
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,559
are ill-mannered.

153
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,720
Fourth Sister,

154
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,720
Nanny Kong won't be

155
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,359
at our house forever.

156
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:30,040
She'll leave when it's time.

157
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,920
Do you want to learn more

158
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,480
or learn less?

159
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:39,359
Just over a bout of grudge,

160
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,799
to delay your learning will be a loss with no gain.

161
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:43,799
Enough. No need to talk to her.

162
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,519
Who cares if she learns or not.

163
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:47,679
Eldest Sister

164
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,239
married into a count's manor,

165
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:49,679
but not everyone has that luck.

166
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,799
I advise you

167
00:07:50,799 --> 00:07:52,320
not to be hold such a foolish hope!

168
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:55,679
You just belittled me

169
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:57,160
for being a concubine-born.

170
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,760
You deprecate…

171
00:07:58,799 --> 00:08:00,160
you deprecate me left and right with words.

172
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,640
Fine, fine, fine.

173
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,239
I know I am an extra.

174
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:05,440
I'll just won't live anymore, is that alright?

175
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:07,239
Fifth Sister!

176
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:09,160
Fourth Sister!

177
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,799
Let me just hit my head to death!

178
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:12,799
Fourth Sister!

179
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,279
Hey, you let go!

180
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,079
Hurry and come help!

181
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:17,519
Let me hit myself to death!

182
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,480
Miss.

183
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:19,640
You can't!

184
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,200
You all shouldn't mind her. She can't bear to die.

185
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,119
Fourth Sister!

186
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,119
What in the world has happened?

187
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:28,959
It's so late,

188
00:08:29,239 --> 00:08:30,559
and class hasn't been dismissed so the girls can eat?

189
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,039
And the Fourth and Fifth Misses

190
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:34,960
were fighting,

191
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,479
with crying and screaming.

192
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,320
Nanny Kong is punishing them

193
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,320
to transcribe the “Fragrant Invitation”.

194
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,880
Fifty times per person

195
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:41,799
and no one is dismissed

196
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,640
until they're done transcribing.

197
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,679
Each hall's servants

198
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,840
are hiding outside.

199
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:47,640
No one dares to go in the room

200
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:48,960
to plead for the misses.

201
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,400
This time,

202
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,200
Sixth Miss is having to be punished along

203
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,960
the two older sisters again.

204
00:08:54,479 --> 00:08:55,440
Unfair again.

205
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,719
Perhaps you'd like to go take a look?

206
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,760
I invited her

207
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,359
to come teach my granddaughters the rules.

208
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:06,000
How can I break the rules myself first?

209
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,520
That old sister of mine

210
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,359
is most fair.

211
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:12,159
She won't wrong anyone.

212
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:13,919
This is good too.

213
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:16,119
Giving them a lesson.

214
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,239
Later on,

215
00:09:17,479 --> 00:09:19,159
they will walk fewer crooked paths too.

216
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:28,919
Master. Master.

217
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:00,520
Nanny.

218
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:04,080
I've disturbed everyone today.

219
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,679
Originally,

220
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:07,359
this matter needn't startle so many.

221
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,359
But since Old Madam entrusted me,

222
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,280
I don't dare to languish in my duty either.

223
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,359
Hence we've disturbed Your Lordship and Madam.

224
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:15,960
Also,

225
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,919
since Miss Mo is raised in Mistress Lin's room,

226
00:10:18,359 --> 00:10:20,640
I've caused you to come make a trip too.

227
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:46,080
Nanny, please speak at ease.

228
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,599
I imagined there were gossipy ones

229
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,080
on the way

230
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:52,000
that reported the fighting

231
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,359
that occurred this afternoon to the three of you.

232
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,440
Though it's a petty matter of the women's quarters,

233
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:58,400
the Misses are all grown.

234
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:00,400
Some things

235
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,119
must be made clear as to right and wrong.

236
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,960
They need to be aware that a thousand li long

237
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,200
embankment can be collapsed by one ant-hole.

238
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:07,799
If they are not be punished for minor errors,

239
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,719
they will brew into larger ones.

240
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,520
You delinquents!

241
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,280
To incur such shameful acts!

242
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:19,119
Kneel, all of you!

243
00:11:24,119 --> 00:11:25,039
The floor is cold.

244
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,000
Let's not freeze

245
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,719
the Misses' knees.

246
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,320
Attendants.

247
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:31,320
Lay cushions down for the Misses.

248
00:11:57,599 --> 00:11:58,880
You lack knowledge of etiquette

249
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,479
and speak nonsense.

250
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:03,440
How are you different

251
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,320
from the coarse village women?

252
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:06,760
What face do you have

253
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:07,960
left to be descendants of Sheng House?

254
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,440
You're at least all girls.

255
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,359
If you were boys,

256
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:15,119
you'd hardly spare yourselves from fighting over

257
00:12:15,119 --> 00:12:16,080
house and inheritance in the future.

258
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:18,239
And this is would be the calamity

259
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:19,919
that divides the brothers!

260
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,359
There is no sincerity

261
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:25,679
if we don't apply the house punishment.

262
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,200
You needn't be upset, Your Lordship.

263
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,559
Blind punishment isn't appropriate either.

264
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:33,000
The Misses must come to realize

265
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:35,200
where they've erred.

266
00:12:36,719 --> 00:12:37,880
I am the nanny

267
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,039
that's teaching the Misses.

268
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:40,320
So to be loosely said,

269
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,400
I am a half a teacher as well.

270
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,840
How about letting me to ask them?

271
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,840
Nanny,

272
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,080
your refined knowledge the top-notch.

273
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:51,400
Even the noble ladies of the palace back then

274
00:12:51,599 --> 00:12:53,239
were at your disposal for asking and scolding.

275
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:55,039
So these delinquents?

276
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,799
Momo, please ask at your pleasure.

277
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:04,440
Do you all know your mistakes?

278
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,400
We do.

279
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:10,640
You all say you know your mistakes,

280
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,239
but I think this may not be so.

281
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:15,239
In this world,

282
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:18,039
most matters can't escape from reason.

283
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:21,159
I am someone who's never been fond of

284
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,520
saying one thing on the surface

285
00:13:22,599 --> 00:13:23,840
but another beneath it.

286
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,400
It will just cause misunderstanding.

287
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:29,080
So today, before each other in person

288
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,039
and before your parents,

289
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:33,200
let us speak to clear this at once.

290
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,799
Then let's start with the cause.

291
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:42,320
Fourth Miss, raise your head.

292
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,239
I will ask you.

293
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:45,919
Fifth Miss said you were

294
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,239
always snatching the younger sisters' thunder.

295
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,080
Hogging my lesson time.

296
00:13:50,239 --> 00:13:51,080
Do you acknowledge this?

297
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,840
It's all my fault.

298
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,080
I had thought,

299
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:00,479
it's a rarity that Nanny Kong is here,

300
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,080
so I wanted to learn more

301
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,599
so I can earn honor for my father

302
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,919
and for the family.

303
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:07,599
I didn't think.

304
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,679
I didn't think

305
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:11,679
I'd incurred the displeasure of the sisters instead.

306
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,679
It's all my fault.

307
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,919
Fourth Miss,

308
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,840
you are smart and sharp

309
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,119
and outstanding in all matters.

310
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,400
But today,

311
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,080
I must advise you.

312
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:24,200
Don't let your intelligence

313
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:26,640
regard everyone else as fools.

314
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,960
You must be aware that

315
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,000
the smart man can be ruined by his intelligence.

316
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:34,119
You erred in two things.

317
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:36,359
First, a mistake in speech.

318
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,880
When you argued with your younger sisters,

319
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,479
you should not have

320
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:42,440
kept saying “concubine-born” and “main wife-born”.

321
00:14:43,719 --> 00:14:45,239
Though I have not been in this house for very long,

322
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,919
I can see clearly.

323
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,159
Fourth Miss,

324
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,440
ask your own conscience.

325
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,239
How does your father treat you?

326
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,239
Though you are a concubine-born daughter,

327
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,440
you are allowed to be raised under your birth mother

328
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,960
with no worries of clothing or food.

329
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:06,039
One word of discord,

330
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,039
and you whine and cry wildly about dying.

331
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:12,039
Is this the behavior of a grand house?

332
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,679
Secondly, you held bad intention.

333
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,599
You keep saying you want to learn.

334
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:25,239
You want to earn honor for your family.

335
00:15:25,599 --> 00:15:26,479
Do you mean then that

336
00:15:26,599 --> 00:15:28,520
you're the only daughter of Sheng family?

337
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:30,320
Only through your earning of honor

338
00:15:30,359 --> 00:15:32,520
will the Sheng family be honored?

339
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,359
Then what about your younger sisters?

340
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,479
They needn't learn

341
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,880
and they needn't earn honor then?

342
00:15:39,119 --> 00:15:40,039
Fourth Miss,

343
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,840
I know you always push yourself to be the best,

344
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:46,000
but every person has their own fate.

345
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,200
Today's matter appeared

346
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,159
as though Fifth Miss started it,

347
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,359
but in actuality, it's very linked to you.

348
00:15:53,239 --> 00:15:54,719
These last ten days or so

349
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,599
you have been always fighting to be at the top,

350
00:15:56,599 --> 00:15:58,039
and be a standout in everything.

351
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,280
Any sign of displeasure

352
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,960
and you sob mournfully,

353
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,000
and blame your birth as a concubine-born.

354
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:04,400
Does your behavior

355
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,520
pay any regard to your sisterhood

356
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,640
or any regard to the kindness of your father?

357
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,359
Father, I didn't.

358
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,239
Earlier you've said

359
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:19,799
I was Old Madam's old acquaintance.

360
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,599
So I will be thick-skinned

361
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,799
and speak a few more words.

362
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,200
A family with lots of children

363
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,880
has to have the parents play fair

364
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,320
in order to achieve a serene house of harmony.

365
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:33,200
Though the sisters

366
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,880
should concede to one another,

367
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:37,280
it has to be both

368
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,400
that concede.

369
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:40,640
We can't always have one side concede always.

370
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,440
After time passes,

371
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:44,320
that will likely bring about suspicion

372
00:16:44,479 --> 00:16:46,159
between the sisters and the parents.

373
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,039
Minister Sheng, do you agree?

374
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,479
You are right, Nanny.

375
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,599
Today,

376
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,799
Fifth Miss was quite mighty.

377
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,960
Arguments among sisters

378
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,320
are a common occurrence.

379
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:02,239
You angered your older sister,

380
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:03,400
then you added oil to fire

381
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,920
with no filter to your words.

382
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,560
Pricking at what hurts her.

383
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,719
You must know that

384
00:17:09,719 --> 00:17:11,439
the source of a disaster is the mouth.

385
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:15,040
Your temper needs to be changed,

386
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,760
or it will court a big disaster in the future.

387
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,839
As I see it,

388
00:17:20,479 --> 00:17:21,920
you should be punished more severely

389
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,400
than your sisters.

390
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:32,359
I know my error.

391
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I won't dare ever to

392
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,959
speak more nonsense.

393
00:17:38,719 --> 00:17:39,520
Sixth Miss,

394
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:41,479
you must surely deem

395
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,319
yourself without being wrong today,

396
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:45,479
and thus you shouldn't be implicated. Is that right?

397
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,880
Then let me teach you

398
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,280
a principle today.

399
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,760
A family of siblings

400
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,359
are like tree branches attached together.

401
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:00,959
Together is their glory and their demise.

402
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:04,040
If you're glorified later on,

403
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,520
your entire family is glorified.

404
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:06,800
If you shame yourself,

405
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,760
the entire family is shamed

406
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,119
by you and no one is spared.

407
00:18:11,439 --> 00:18:13,719
Today, though you committed no wrong,

408
00:18:14,199 --> 00:18:16,160
your older sisters both erred,

409
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:18,119
hence you've erred without committing an error.

410
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,839
I will punish you along with them soon.

411
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,239
Do you concede?

412
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,359
Nanny,

413
00:18:25,719 --> 00:18:27,439
Ming'er didn't

414
00:18:27,479 --> 00:18:28,719
do anything wrong.

415
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,959
And she's the youngest

416
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,599
and weak-bodied.

417
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:35,520
How about just giving her a few words of reprimand?

418
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:37,359
She's the most sensible

419
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:38,920
and obedient usually.

420
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,560
She'll remember your words to heart in the future.

421
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,359
No. If we spare her solely today,

422
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:46,920
it will nurture an air of

423
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,800
indifference among the siblings.

424
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:51,160
And later on,

425
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,680
if something happens to one sibling,

426
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,599
what if the rest just stand and watch?

427
00:18:54,439 --> 00:18:55,640
She must be punished.

428
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:57,520
Punish. Punish her then.

429
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,839
The beatings Miss Ming receives today,

430
00:19:00,199 --> 00:19:02,319
is to let the sisters know

431
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,199
what it means to be one family.

432
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:07,319
Nanny is right.

433
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:08,920
I deserve to be beaten.

434
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:12,000
You sisters argue and fight.

435
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:14,280
A little thing

436
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,719
and you turned into a great big fight and chaos.

437
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:17,760
Compared to the small households

438
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,839
where food and clothing are sparse,

439
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,800
fighting over fruits and clothing to wear.

440
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,959
How do you differ?

441
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:26,199
You must know if a house wants to flourish,

442
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:27,959
it requires absolute

443
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,719
joint effort of the siblings.

444
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:34,119
So many great houses in the past

445
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,280
came to ruin from the inside.

446
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:38,880
May the Misses be wise.

447
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:45,599
Today,

448
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:48,000
I punish you each ten strokes of beating to the hand.

449
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,839
Hold on please, Nanny.

450
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,560
Nanny, please don't mind.

451
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:05,079
Though

452
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:07,160
this isn't a place for me to speak,

453
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,959
I feel guilty

454
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,520
and I must speak to ease it,

455
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,719
and I ask for your understanding.

456
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,160
Today's happening

457
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,000
was rooted

458
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:18,239
in Mo'er's insensibility

459
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:21,040
and she's the cause of the trouble.

460
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:22,479
Especially for Sixth Miss.

461
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,119
At such a young age,

462
00:20:24,199 --> 00:20:25,760
she's having to suffer a beating along with Mo'er,

463
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,800
it's really

464
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,280
too unbearable for me.

465
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,199
How about having Sixth Miss's ten strokes

466
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,839
be taken by Mo'er on her behalf?

467
00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:38,079
Mistress Lin's words are erroneous.

468
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:40,560
I am punishing the Misses together.

469
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:42,000
It's to amend affection

470
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,760
among the sisters.

471
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:46,439
If they suffer a beating together today,

472
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,640
they can start afresh tomorrow from it.

473
00:20:49,439 --> 00:20:50,760
If we pardon one and punish another,

474
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,599
won't that cause more suspicion?

475
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,439
Mistress Lin has great intention,

476
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,760
but it lacks moral orthodoxy.

477
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:01,680
Yes, your words are right.

478
00:21:02,199 --> 00:21:03,800
It's my ignorance.

479
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,000
But today,

480
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:08,760
she's implicated with the older sisters into beating.

481
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:10,280
I just

482
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,880
can't bear it.

483
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,640
It's all my fault that I didn't teach Mo'er well.

484
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:17,719
Nanny,

485
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,439
perhaps you should just punish me too,

486
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:22,119
to make some amends?

487
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,319
This again.

488
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,280
I see that Mistress Lin really does need to

489
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,319
learn some rules.

490
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,160
Your words are getting more ill-fitting as you speak.

491
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,000
You said

492
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,280
you should be punished

493
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:40,599
because you hadn't taught Sister Mo well.

494
00:21:41,239 --> 00:21:42,119
Then Sister Ru

495
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,800
was taught by Big Madam.

496
00:21:44,199 --> 00:21:45,040
Miss Ming

497
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:46,599
was raised by Old Madam.

498
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,640
Should both Big Madam

499
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,239
and Old Madam also be punished then?

500
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,359
And I, as the teaching nanny,

501
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,119
even more so I can't be spared from punishment?

502
00:21:56,479 --> 00:21:58,000
Is that what you mean here?

503
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,719
No, no. I didn't mean that.

504
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:01,839
Mistress Lin.

505
00:22:02,199 --> 00:22:04,000
I must say a word to you today too.

506
00:22:04,719 --> 00:22:07,199
A person's value is in self-awareness,

507
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,640
but you are ignorant of two things.

508
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:12,359
You know what your status is.

509
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,239
When I am discussing

510
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,239
with the Minister and Madam,

511
00:22:15,239 --> 00:22:16,640
should you or

512
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,839
should you not barge into our conversation?

513
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,680
Thankfully I am an old acquaintance of Old Madam.

514
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,560
If it were another person,

515
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:24,439
you'd cause the laughter of others

516
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,040
in saying Sheng House has no rules.

517
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,160
The second mistake is

518
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,520
that you committed the error while knowing it was an error.

519
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:34,119
First, you say you shouldn't speak,

520
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,719
but you chose to speak anyway.

521
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:38,800
You keep saying you are ignorant.

522
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,800
Since you know you were ignorant,

523
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:43,040
why did you still barge into

524
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:45,119
the matter of the Misses' teaching?

525
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:49,239
You clearly knew everything,

526
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,160
but you still defied it all.

527
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,880
It's adding another offense

528
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,040
of committing knowingly.

529
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:57,599
Can't be that you think

530
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:59,439
because you are raising a few children

531
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,319
that you are above the rules?

532
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,479
Big Madam and the nanny

533
00:23:09,479 --> 00:23:10,520
are here.

534
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:12,479
Is there a place for you to talk?

535
00:23:14,479 --> 00:23:15,880
Look how you've raised the child

536
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,479
and you still have the face

537
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,680
to speak here?

538
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,119
Back off,

539
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,239
and stop embarrassing me

540
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,359
here.

541
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,280
I punish you

542
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:32,839
each ten strikes on the hand.

543
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,040
When you go back,

544
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,400
finish transcribing the

545
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,359
”Fragrant Invitation” poem fifty times.

546
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:38,040
Whoever isn't done transcribing by tomorrow,

547
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,199
do not come here.

548
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,280
Today's punishment incident,

549
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,160
you are not allowed to discuss outside.

550
00:23:43,719 --> 00:23:44,719
You must preserve

551
00:23:44,719 --> 00:23:45,640
the honorable reputation of the Misses.

552
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,280
Go now.

553
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:48,479
Yes.

554
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:02,800
Punish.

555
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,319
Father.

556
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,239
Did you take the book box?

557
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,599
I've got it.

558
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:30,520
Don't worry, Miss.

559
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:33,680
Did you not ache enough earlier?

560
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,359
You still remember about your belongings.

561
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,040
The nanny said fifty copies of “Fragrant Invitation”

562
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,560
and I need to finish transcribing it tonight.

563
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:48,880
Such a thick stack.

564
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:50,640
How can you finish transcribing it?

565
00:24:52,719 --> 00:24:53,760
I just have to do my best.

566
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,479
One extra word written

567
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,319
is better than one word less.

568
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:02,000
Nanny Kong beat you

569
00:25:02,199 --> 00:25:03,000
and you're not mad at her?

570
00:25:04,239 --> 00:25:06,160
And you seek more suffering for yourself?

571
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,400
She did it for Sheng House's sake.

572
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:11,439
The elder

573
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,239
already spoke of

574
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,439
that principle clearly.

575
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:18,359
Put out your hand for me to see.

576
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:26,280
Does it hurt?

577
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:27,839
It hurts.

578
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:30,040
Since it hurts,

579
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,359
why didn't you cry earlier?

580
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:35,079
I've erred and deserved the punishment.

581
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:36,599
There's nothing unfair.

582
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,680
Good child.

583
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:43,479
You are a good child indeed.

584
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:46,119
Nanny Kong said something that

585
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:47,640
enlightened me earlier.

586
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,439
No matter managing the house or teaching children,

587
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:52,400
it should all be a level bowl of water.

588
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,800
If you suffer anything unfair in the future,

589
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,920
come to tell me.

590
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:57,719
I will stand up for you.

591
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:05,199
All is well for your daughter now.

592
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,400
I thank Father deeply for the care.

593
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,040
Father. Father,

594
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,280
save a life! Father!

595
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:14,760
What happened? Why this fretting?

596
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:17,000
Nanny Kong dismissed the punishment meeting.

597
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,640
But Big Madam won't let Mistress Lin go,

598
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,000
and insists she kneel and take a beating!

599
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,560
Father, help Mistress Lin!

600
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,400
What?

601
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:27,959
Master hasn't even spoken

602
00:26:27,959 --> 00:26:28,719
more than two words

603
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,839
to you and he's summoned away again.

604
00:26:32,239 --> 00:26:33,119
It's no loss.

605
00:26:35,479 --> 00:26:37,599
The time I needed him has already passed.

606
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,119
Miss.

607
00:26:43,439 --> 00:26:44,400
Old Madam

608
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,319
asks you to come see her.

609
00:26:47,199 --> 00:26:47,880
Alright.

610
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,760
I will put away the items

611
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,839
and change, then come.

612
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:52,079
You can't. You can't.

613
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:53,640
Big Madam, what are you trying to do?

614
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:54,880
Don't tell me you're using

615
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,760
private punishment unauthorized?

616
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,000
It's all my fault,

617
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:58,760
so on what basis do you punish my mother?

618
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,119
Funny.

619
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:02,079
A concubine is a servant.

620
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,199
It's due to His Lordship's and my mercy

621
00:27:03,239 --> 00:27:05,199
that we allowed you to be raised by her.

622
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,719
Now she's undisciplined

623
00:27:06,719 --> 00:27:07,760
in teaching her child

624
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:08,719
and disregarded the master,

625
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,079
bringing shame to the whole family,

626
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:11,599
as the Madam of the house,

627
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:12,640
why can't I beat her? Beat her!

628
00:27:13,239 --> 00:27:14,040
Beat

629
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:16,719
No, no.

630
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:18,640
Move. You can't hit her.

631
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,680
Big Madam, you can't.

632
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,560
What are you doing?

633
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,280
Father.

634
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,800
Stop crying.

635
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:30,920
The Lin Clanswoman is at fault,

636
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:31,520
but why must you do so

637
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,920
before the child?

638
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,280
Did you forget what the nanny said, Minister?

639
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:38,280
Grand families

640
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,479
all collapse from within!

641
00:27:41,439 --> 00:27:42,760
Undisciplined in managing the house

642
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,520
and inept in teaching children?

643
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:45,479
That's to bring endless future disasters!

644
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,479
It's all due to the Minister's bias

645
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,280
and spoiling that we've come to this plight.

646
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:52,880
She's the slave and I'm the master.

647
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,319
Do I have to pick a place to discipline?

648
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,359
Big Madam said the three of us,

649
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,680
mother and children, were spoiled by Father.

650
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,880
So Madam means Father is at fault too!

651
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,520
You oaf born to a concubine!

652
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:13,920
What face do you have to speak here?

653
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:15,680
Get lost! Hit her!

654
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,839
You can't. You can't.

655
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:19,959
Be merciful, Madam.

656
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:22,760
Mo'er. Mo'er.

657
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,520
You lot of concubine and illegitimate children.

658
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:33,479
You sure know how to put on a good show.

659
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,000
Hit them all!

660
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,920
Who dares!

661
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,439
This is all for Sheng family's sake.

662
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:47,400
You're just venting out

663
00:28:47,439 --> 00:28:48,319
your own grudge!

664
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,119
Sheng family?

665
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,680
Sheng family is nothing

666
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,839
in your eyes!

667
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,599
Grandmother,

668
00:29:12,479 --> 00:29:14,880
Nanny Kong is so admirable.

669
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,520
You got beaten, and a principle was hammered out?

670
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,479
She knew we committed mistakes,

671
00:29:25,719 --> 00:29:27,119
but she didn't rush to air it.

672
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,520
She just

673
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,760
let Fourth and Fifth Sisters

674
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,959
fight in the open and covertly.

675
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,359
Until today

676
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,479
when the fire was lit,

677
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,280
when she then stood out to take charge,

678
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,520
to point out the faults and punish severely.

679
00:29:39,479 --> 00:29:40,959
That has your admiration?

680
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,119
Then you ought to study diligently.

681
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:46,479
This skill of patience in grinding with water

682
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,959
isn't something everyone can do.

683
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:49,119
Someone like Big Madam

684
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,599
has never achieved it in her life.

685
00:29:51,719 --> 00:29:53,359
Nanny Kong's most noble act

686
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,280
is that she prepared far in advance

687
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,359
the cushions for kneeling,

688
00:29:56,719 --> 00:29:57,880
the stick for hitting the hand

689
00:29:58,199 --> 00:29:59,400
and even the iced towels for after the beating,

690
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,680
she had them

691
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,760
brought in too.

692
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,319
Even if Father was present

693
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,800
and wanted to make a plea for leniency,

694
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,839
there was no room for it.

695
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:11,079
Just let me suffer.

696
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,160
Suffer me to die instead!

697
00:30:13,199 --> 00:30:14,959
Father hit me so hard.

698
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,000
He must not dote on me anymore!

699
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,640
Hurry and let me put medicine on you.

700
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,920
It's all my fault.

701
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:22,239
I'm always telling you to stand out and win.

702
00:30:24,479 --> 00:30:26,479
I forgot about the skill of hiding one's talent.

703
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,079
Today, you hit the whirlpool.

704
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:30,680
Don't fret, Miss.

705
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:31,719
His Lordship was paying

706
00:30:31,719 --> 00:30:32,880
respect to Nanny Kong

707
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,920
that he punished you.

708
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,040
His Lordship cares about you.

709
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:36,760
Look,

710
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,359
he's sent the ointment right away.

711
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,400
If it were another day,

712
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,520
Father would've been here a long time ago.

713
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,079
But even my mother

714
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:43,000
was scolded too today.

715
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,760
What do we do?

716
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,560
Maybe Father doesn't dote on us anymore!

717
00:30:50,439 --> 00:30:51,520
Never fear, never fear.

718
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,160
Never fear.

719
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,040
It's a matter of adopting appropriate measures.

720
00:30:57,359 --> 00:30:58,079
Nanny Kong

721
00:30:58,359 --> 00:30:59,079
won't be in our house forever.

722
00:30:59,079 --> 00:30:59,760
She'll have to

723
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,079
leave eventually.

724
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,319
And Big Madam

725
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,959
is no match to our Mo'er,

726
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,800
right?

727
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,400
Master is here.

728
00:31:16,439 --> 00:31:17,239
How is it?

729
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,880
Your hand still swollen?

730
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,439
What are you doing here, Father?

731
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,640
I thought Father doesn't love me

732
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,800
and doesn't want me anymore.

733
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:35,280
Nonsense. How can it be?

734
00:31:36,199 --> 00:31:37,000
At Weirui Balcony

735
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,079
in front of the nanny,

736
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:40,520
I couldn't show bias for you, Mo'er.

737
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,319
So that's why I had you hit.

738
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,839
You can't blame me.

739
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,560
It's all my fault that

740
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:47,400
I didn't teach our daughter well

741
00:31:47,719 --> 00:31:48,920
and provoked Big Madam's anger.

742
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:51,599
Why do you mention her?

743
00:31:53,199 --> 00:31:53,959
Alright,

744
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,839
Mo'er. Just rest now.

745
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:58,000
I will escort Your Lordship to sleep.

746
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,599
Mo'er still needs to transcribe.

747
00:32:01,239 --> 00:32:02,599
Transcribe? Transcribe what?

748
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,920
Her hand's so swollen.

749
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:04,880
Mo'er,

750
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,560
the ointment I got works very well.

751
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,640
A night's sleep and you'll be fine.

752
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,239
Sleep.

753
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:12,560
Pitiful thing. Go sleep!

754
00:32:25,239 --> 00:32:26,239
Someone like Mistress Lin

755
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,839
who's been at Sheng House for over a decade,

756
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,000
she's not without faults.

757
00:32:30,959 --> 00:32:31,959
But because

758
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,560
she's clenched Father's doting affection,

759
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,479
whatever

760
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,680
bitterness she airs,

761
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,640
Father will take her stand.

762
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,079
Your father might

763
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:42,520
not be truly blinded by her.

764
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:45,959
He actually knows it very clearly.

765
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,959
Nanny Kong's

766
00:32:47,959 --> 00:32:49,839
most skillful act lies in that.

767
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,000
She didn't try to expose

768
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,719
Mistress Lin's true colors.

769
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:55,439
She knows that if a person pretends to be asleep,

770
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,719
you can't awaken him.

771
00:32:58,239 --> 00:33:00,040
Father already knows,

772
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,839
no matter how great the affection

773
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:02,880
he has for his women,

774
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,199
that is not greater than the entire Sheng honor.

775
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:06,920
Nanny Kong reminded Father

776
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,119
so he was aware.

777
00:33:08,839 --> 00:33:09,880
Pampering the concubine overly much

778
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,400
will only make the home fall into disarray

779
00:33:11,719 --> 00:33:12,800
and siblings divided.

780
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,760
If pushed to the worst,

781
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,319
it will trouble his official career.

782
00:33:16,959 --> 00:33:18,680
As long as Father is reminded of that,

783
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,719
no matter how

784
00:33:19,719 --> 00:33:20,920
he treasures Mistress Lin,

785
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:22,199
he will have to punish her.

786
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,719
This is a case of defeating the enemy

787
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:25,560
by capturing their chief.

788
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:29,599
Grandmother,I finally realized today

789
00:33:29,959 --> 00:33:31,079
that when you invited Nanny Kong,

790
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:33,079
learning about tea brewing

791
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,000
and evaluating incense, that's all secondary.

792
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,959
The urgent matter is that you wanted me to learn

793
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:38,839
how to place myself in the future.

794
00:33:39,719 --> 00:33:40,800
To learn from a nanny like her,

795
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,319
I am willing to

796
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:43,400
be beaten contently daily!

797
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:46,800
You're a child who's experienced suffering,

798
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,680
so you understand these principles.

799
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:51,680
But the Big Madam of our house,

800
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,599
it's due to her life

801
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,319
as a child being too good.

802
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,400
The entire family spoiled her and

803
00:33:57,959 --> 00:33:59,719
she is completely unaware of

804
00:33:59,719 --> 00:34:00,640
how to exercise forbearance and patience.

805
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:02,800
She does not how to exercise balance.

806
00:34:03,719 --> 00:34:04,560
That's why she was taken advantage of by Mistress Lin

807
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,920
all these years.

808
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,800
Big Madam is quick-tempered and a straight-talker.

809
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,760
She does what she contents without restraint.

810
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,399
Living so in life,

811
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:18,080
that seems quite good too?

812
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,840
That won't do.

813
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,719
If a person's life is too smooth,

814
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,639
they will go blind and deaf.

815
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:27,919
Ming'er,

816
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,679
you must be awake always.

817
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,719
I understand.

818
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,520
Old Madam.

819
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,719
Sixth Miss's aunt

820
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,120
is still waiting outside.

821
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:39,120
She is saying it's late

822
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,840
and is wondering when Sixth Miss will return to sleep.

823
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,000
I replied,

824
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,040
Sixth Miss is still conversing with you

825
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,360
and I invited her inside to wait.

826
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,919
But she said she would just stand

827
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:48,800
and wait in the yard!

828
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,399
Your aunt is concerned about you.

829
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,080
Go on.

830
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:08,040
That damned whore!

831
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,600
She was clearly at fault today,

832
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:13,080
but she put on that seductive act again

833
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:15,080
to have the Minister embarrass me!

834
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:20,959
You should've stopped when it was appropriate.

835
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,439
Why did you insist on having Mistress Lin kneel

836
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,679
and be beaten?

837
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,000
His Lordship comes

838
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,439
and Young Master Feng is pleading too.

839
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:29,760
Why didn't you take that chance to get off the donkey

840
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,719
and just scold her a few words?

841
00:35:32,959 --> 00:35:33,760
What would that do?

842
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,760
I finally got ahold of her vice,

843
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:36,560
and I can't breathe

844
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,639
if I can't vent.

845
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,479
But you can't

846
00:35:41,479 --> 00:35:42,959
just say a mouthful of concubine-born.

847
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,800
You poked His Lordship

848
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,320
where it pains him and why wouldn't he get upset?

849
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,760
Now,

850
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,719
even her mistake is not a mistake anymore.

851
00:35:51,439 --> 00:35:52,600
His Lordship was angry

852
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:54,600
not because you hit and scolded

853
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,679
that Lin Clanswoman,

854
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,919
it was because

855
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,959
your words were improper.

856
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,719
I was anxious and forget about everything.

857
00:36:04,879 --> 00:36:06,360
I was just teaching Ru'er

858
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:07,479
not to always talk about

859
00:36:07,479 --> 00:36:08,879
being concubine-born a few days ago

860
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,399
and I myself forgot instead.

861
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,639
Why didn't you stop me?

862
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:15,840
A great chess board

863
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,159
and a total loss.

864
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,760
The Minister ran over to that

865
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,600
whore's room again.

866
00:36:21,959 --> 00:36:23,399
You've learned this lesson.

867
00:36:23,479 --> 00:36:24,760
And in the future,

868
00:36:24,959 --> 00:36:26,399
you ought to be more prudent.

869
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,360
Don't always let

870
00:36:27,399 --> 00:36:28,719
your momentary emotions rule.

871
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,800
What matters most right now

872
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,320
is Young Master Bai's learning.

873
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,919
You must judge what matters and what's urgent.

874
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,600
Yes.

875
00:36:40,479 --> 00:36:41,679
As long as my son

876
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:42,919
wins top marks in the Imperial exam,

877
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:45,520
who'd fear that we can't press down the lot of them?

878
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,959
Yes, yes, yes.

879
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,120
If they weren't guilty of anything sinister,

880
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:55,639
why would Miss Zhou seek you out?

881
00:36:56,439 --> 00:36:57,560
I came to the Sheng House,

882
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,439
and everyone already knew on the first day.

883
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:01,479
No one came to pay court,

884
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
but only she came to you

885
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,159
to talk about this and that.

886
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:06,840
She's not so diligent

887
00:37:06,879 --> 00:37:08,159
usually.

888
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:10,199
But she's diligent come now,

889
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:11,320
and it must be because she's guilty!

890
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:14,520
She must be the one who framed Xiaodie.

891
00:37:17,879 --> 00:37:19,320
She is shrewd.

892
00:37:19,959 --> 00:37:21,040
I don't know

893
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,120
if it's because her maidservants

894
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:23,959
were in-fighting,

895
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,719
or if she was plotting something else.

896
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,399
But plotting what?

897
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,399
Ming'er, what do you think it can be?

898
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:36,840
I don't know.

899
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:47,479
Aunt, you go back to Yangzhou tomorrow.

900
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:48,479
Tomorrow?

901
00:37:49,439 --> 00:37:51,719
No, I need to stay here and guard you.

902
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,199
You're my big sister's

903
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:54,360
only blood and flesh.

904
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,280
If I don't find out this mystery,

905
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,679
I can't be pacified.

906
00:37:58,399 --> 00:37:59,360
But we need you to go

907
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,239
so the peculiarity can show a tail.

908
00:38:02,439 --> 00:38:04,439
You go tomorrow, furtively.

909
00:38:04,919 --> 00:38:05,560
When they discover

910
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,600
you're gone,

911
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:08,040
they'll feel anxious

912
00:38:08,439 --> 00:38:09,320
and follow you.

913
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,399
Follow me and then what?

914
00:38:12,879 --> 00:38:15,360
Aunt, you've farmed the fields before.

915
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:16,959
If there's a poisonous snake

916
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,320
in the field,

917
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:19,520
what will you do?

918
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:22,760
Strike it with a stick

919
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,560
and he'll slither out.

920
00:38:30,879 --> 00:38:32,000
I understand now.

921
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:34,159
I understand.

922
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,600
You're that bamboo stick to hit that snake.

923
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,239
Miss.

924
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,159
Come have this pot of tea.

925
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,879
You need to energize to

926
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,560
finish thirty more of these.

927
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:47,520
Xiaotao!

928
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,959
You almost got them burned!

929
00:38:52,919 --> 00:38:53,600
Give them to me.

930
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,719
What's the reason

931
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:42,040
for her to leave in the middle of the night

932
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:44,560
so secretly?

933
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,360
Your man

934
00:39:47,399 --> 00:39:48,600
knows some runners, right?

935
00:39:48,879 --> 00:39:49,679
Yes.

936
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,159
Follow her,

937
00:39:51,399 --> 00:39:52,879
and take care of things in Yangzhou.

938
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:55,360
Don't let all these years

939
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,479
be tripped up

940
00:39:56,479 --> 00:39:57,879
by a farm woman.

941
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:00,719
Don't worry, Mistress.

942
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,879
Your family is too cordial.

943
00:40:05,919 --> 00:40:07,600
One of my feet is already in the grave,

944
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,479
so why would I have the need for all this stuff?

945
00:40:09,959 --> 00:40:12,560
If someone asks later on about

946
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:15,080
my family's daughters' appearance and character,

947
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,399
may Nanny Kong

948
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,360
speak a few fond words.

949
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,879
This elderly lady understands

950
00:40:19,919 --> 00:40:21,159
how you love your children.

951
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,840
But I don't think you need to bother.

952
00:40:24,439 --> 00:40:26,600
As it's said,

953
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,520
the distant travel requires horsepower.

954
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,639
What kind of disposition and conduct the misses show,

955
00:40:29,959 --> 00:40:30,840
after some time,

956
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,560
the capital will spread the word on its own.

957
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,479
It won't require me to speak here and there.

958
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,479
Big Madam, your eldest daughter

959
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,000
at the House of Count Zhongqin,

960
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:42,159
everyone praises her

961
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:43,879
and that's a living reputation for you.

962
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:45,280
So you needn't worry about

963
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,159
the prospects of the other girls.

964
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,840
Yes, you're right.

965
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,520
Alright, I'll leave now.

966
00:40:53,439 --> 00:40:55,600
Children, take care of yourselves.

967
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:00,520
Be careful.

968
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:32,040
Father.

969
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,760
You say you're out to seek knowledge every day?

970
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,719
But there are so many ministerial scholars

971
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:52,840
and you don't visit them,

972
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,320
just going to Sheng's daily.

973
00:41:55,959 --> 00:41:56,520
I don't know

974
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,040
what exactly you're learning there.

975
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,320
Scholar Master Zhuang is teaching recently

976
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,760
about a man establishing himself in the world.

977
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,159
I wonder how

978
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:05,520
you view it, Father.

979
00:42:09,439 --> 00:42:10,439
A man can establish himself in the world

980
00:42:10,439 --> 00:42:11,239
as long as he can stand up against the world with a clear conscience,

981
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:12,760
with loyalty and allegiance to his nation

982
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,959
and harmony in his home.

983
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,719
You need to bother asking me that?

984
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,280
Clear conscience and harmony in the family.

985
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,879
In Classic of Rites from the Great Learning,

986
00:42:22,479 --> 00:42:23,919
"Wanting to harmonize his own clan,

987
00:42:23,919 --> 00:42:25,199
one must first cultivate himself."

988
00:42:26,199 --> 00:42:28,520
I wonder if there's anything against your conscience,

989
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,959
Father?

990
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:36,800
You have studied for only a few days

991
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,199
and you haven't written a couple of essays.

992
00:42:38,879 --> 00:42:40,879
Instead, you come and test your father?

993
00:42:55,479 --> 00:42:56,760
Second Gu, Second Gu,

994
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,840
you're so easily scared.

995
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,520
Scared of what?
