00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,200
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,159
Episode 12

3
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,480
Sit.

4
00:01:11,559 --> 00:01:13,599
These few days with Brothers Bai and Feng

5
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:16,080
taking Imperial exams,

6
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,959
with only two gone, the whole house is suddenly

7
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:22,400
so quiet now.

8
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,519
Replying to Grandmother,

9
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:24,639
my mother says these next few days

10
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,040
she's going to abstain from bathing

11
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,760
and shut her doors to devote herself to prayer.

12
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,720
Others are not allowed to make a ruckus.

13
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,680
I hear Big Madam is praying to Confucius,

14
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,919
Buddhist and Taoist deities, all three at once.

15
00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:38,800
I don't know which is the divine spirit?

16
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,639
Your mother isn't devoted to the gods or Buddha.

17
00:01:44,639 --> 00:01:47,040
But I hear everyone in Linqi Pavilion

18
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,839
is holding a copy of the Book of Changes lately.

19
00:01:48,839 --> 00:01:50,239
Even those who are illiterate

20
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:52,440
are holding a compass and making calculations.

21
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,120
Who knows?

22
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,199
Maybe a person's life is already fated at birth.

23
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,800
Noble is noble, and lowly is lowly.

24
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,239
No matter how you calculate, it's all useless.

25
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:04,919
Fifth Sister, who are you talking about here?

26
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:06,639
I wasn't talking about anyone.

27
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:08,880
Sister, we are just chatting idly

28
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,880
while gathered by Grandmother.

29
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,199
Why are you getting all upset for?

30
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,600
I . . .

31
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,160
Grandmother, actually, no matter what my mother prays for,

32
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,639
it's all for the sake of the whole family.

33
00:02:36,279 --> 00:02:38,759
During the time of your brothers' exam time,

34
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,759
we must have the family in harmony.

35
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:44,160
You sisterhood must help your main mother

36
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,800
watch over the house.

37
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:50,960
Yes.

38
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,320
Miss, the sun's about to go down. How about

39
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,520
Didn't I tell you? You're not allowed to mention

40
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,919
the word “down' these days!

41
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,440
Can't you remember this?

42
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,160
A petty air is just petty.

43
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,039
If he can pass the exam

44
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:09,039
by abstaining from using some words,

45
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:11,880
then all the monks in the temple can be top scorers.

46
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,720
Even if this Brother passes with high marks,

47
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,759
the concubine-born sister?

48
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:17,119
She still can't social-climb her way into the ducal house!

49
00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:18,800
You…

50
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,639
How can you say such shameless words?

51
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,199
Father has already said, no one was allowed

52
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:23,960
to fight over legitimate

53
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,080
or concubine line anymore at home.

54
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,279
The way you speak, you're disregarding Father.

55
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:31,559
That acts again.

56
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,919
Nothing new?

57
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,639
Just cry then.

58
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:36,919
After you're done crying, go tattle.

59
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,279
I'm not scared.

60
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:39,679
You…

61
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,919
Fourth Sister, don't cry anymore.

62
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:57,759
Everyone's worried about the exam now.

63
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:02,199
Later, if Father hears you, he might blame you.

64
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:55,000
Sixth Miss, it's very cold. Don't catch a chill.

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,760
Xiaotao, add a cloak for Miss.

66
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,359
What are you looking at, Miss?

67
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:09,160
Fan House has lights on.

68
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,440
I heard it was ordered by the Duke and Duchess of Qi

69
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,440
to hang them for luck.

70
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,880
Miss.

71
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:17,959
They all say Young Lord is loved by a million.

72
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:21,799
Other than parents, he has others thinking of him.

73
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:47,559
Brilliantly white like snow on the mountain.

74
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,839
Shining brightly as the moon between clouds.

75
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,640
Don't worry, Mother.

76
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,760
Second Brother will be alright.

77
00:06:41,679 --> 00:06:43,640
Why isn't he coming out?

78
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,119
The door's not open yet.

79
00:06:45,119 --> 00:06:48,559
I know. I'm just anxious.

80
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,519
They're coming out.

81
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,279
Brother Bai is coming out.

82
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,359
You have to make an exception

83
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:15,559
and go drink at the Fan House with me.

84
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:17,519
Father. Mother.

85
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:19,119
Was it cold in the exam courtyard?

86
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:22,320
Your family's waiting while scratching their ears.

87
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,119
What's he saying there? Hurry and come now.

88
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,640
Second Brother. Feng'er.

89
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,760
Father. Mother.

90
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,119
Bai'er. How did the exam go?

91
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:36,760
Young Master. Over here.

92
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,440
Young Master.

93
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,959
Let me. How did it go, Second Brother?

94
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:44,519
I'm sure he can place it at the top!

95
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:46,880
You must be so exhausted.

96
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,480
I'll help you recuperate.

97
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,839
Let's go. Did the scholar guess it right?

98
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,519
You've only tested for three days

99
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:56,279
and you've thinned out three rounds.

100
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,000
Were the exam topics

101
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,559
very different from what you studied for?

102
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,119
Your mother worries so much these days.

103
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:07,760
I'm talking to you.

104
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,399
Mother. Let me catch my breath first.

105
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:12,600
I was holed up in that shell of a room for three days.

106
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,640
I need to get some fresh air.

107
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:17,519
Alright, then. Get some air. Let's go.

108
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:19,079
Get in the carriage.

109
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:55,039
What did you see? You're so happy.

110
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,440
I didn't get to see Mother

111
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,239
for three days and I've missed you.

112
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:01,679
Now I'm heading home.

113
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:04,080
I don't know why but I just feel happy.

114
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:11,719
Your mouth is growing sweeter.

115
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,359
Xueniang's man Chiwu was sent off

116
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:39,359
for Yangzhou by Mistress Lin today,

117
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:42,000
saying it's to procure some items.

118
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,119
Such timing she picks.

119
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:47,239
The entire family is waiting for exam results

120
00:09:47,239 --> 00:09:48,799
and there's no room to think about anything else,

121
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,039
so no one will notice her.

122
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:53,679
Do we go see your aunt later today?

123
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:54,960
Not later today, right now.

124
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,799
You go to the inn right away.

125
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:00,440
Tell my aunt the snake's already shown itself.

126
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,000
As long as she follows that Chiwu,

127
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,520
she won't need to worry that she won't find some clues.

128
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,320
Miss, you wanted me to pretend

129
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:07,280
like I was sending your aunt

130
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,239
back to Yangzhou secretly late at night,

131
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,880
and installing your aunt at the inn.

132
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,679
At the time, I didn't know what you were trying to do.

133
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:16,919
Now you know then?

134
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,840
Fishing requires a hook and a bait.

135
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,799
Now, we just wait for news.

136
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:07,840
This morning's incense is burning so beautifully.

137
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,880
Great, like a lotus flower!

138
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,440
That's a great auspicious sign from above.

139
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,000
I bet our Bai'er must have placed at the top!

140
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yes, yes, top placement.

141
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,239
Why is Ru'er still not out yet?

142
00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:23,359
We've finally made it through to the results posting

143
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:24,919
and she's still so lazy?

144
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:27,440
Hurry and rush Fifth Miss!

145
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:30,400
Winning or losing is at one stroke.

146
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,719
Bai'er must win for me.

147
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:33,559
Best if my son places at the top,

148
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:36,239
and that little rabbit's name falls to the bottom.

149
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:37,200
Then I'll see—eek!

150
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,679
Big Madam! Big Madam!

151
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,200
You put too much power into that stroke.

152
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,880
It's off-scale.

153
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,039
You have something on your mind to break through.

154
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:54,039
If you can't write well, rest a bit.

155
00:11:54,719 --> 00:11:56,719
I can write well.

156
00:11:57,479 --> 00:12:00,320
You're worried about the Young Lord's result.

157
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,679
How can you write well?

158
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:11,400
N-No. I I'm not.

159
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,200
I've lived to such an age,

160
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,239
at least I can tell about these things.

161
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:20,039
The night before the big exam,

162
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,880
Young Lord came

163
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,280
under pretext of paying respects

164
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,479
to come present gifts here.

165
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:25,719
But in reality,

166
00:12:25,719 --> 00:12:28,840
he was just trying to send a gift to you.

167
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,919
That's putting a louse on top of a bald head.

168
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,159
So obvious!

169
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,520
You're the flesh on my heart.

170
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,880
Of course I want you

171
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,080
to have the best match in the world.

172
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:52,960
Qi Yuanruo is a great person and his family is great too.

173
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,719
Just that the family is too great

174
00:12:56,719 --> 00:12:57,599
and the parents are strict.

175
00:12:58,119 --> 00:12:59,039
If you go over there,

176
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:03,400
first, you may not rise to be the main wife,

177
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:08,239
and second, even if you rise to be the main wife,

178
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,479
your days will still just be full of suffering.

179
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:14,440
On this, you'll have to be clear-minded.

180
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:22,359
Princess Pingning is so proud and arrogant.

181
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,440
Her prospects are far-reaching

182
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,599
and too rich to be a good match.

183
00:13:26,719 --> 00:13:28,239
Your granddaughter understands all that.

184
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,599
It's just a bit hard to take.

185
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:46,919
Big Madam rushed out and wasn't careful,

186
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:49,440
so she slipped and sprained her foot.

187
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,880
She's fussing about calling a physician here.

188
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:55,159
The results are posted.

189
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:56,320
Whether you go see it or not,

190
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,960
the rankings won't change.

191
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,799
Old Madam is right.

192
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:01,840
Master said that

193
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,039
let Fifth Miss go and have a look.

194
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:05,280
But Big Madam just

195
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,960
insists on going personally.

196
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,039
She's fussing about it now.

197
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:10,239
Ming'er.

198
00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:13,080
You accompany your Fifth Sister for the trip.

199
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,719
The Minister does not find it convenient to leave.

200
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:17,280
He needs to send a messenger,

201
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,359
and you're my messenger.

202
00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:22,159
Go take a look at the grandsons' result

203
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:23,479
on behalf of the grandmother.

204
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:24,479
That's reasonable and proper.

205
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:31,640
Thank you, Grandmother.

206
00:14:51,239 --> 00:14:53,119
Since the old days, Bianjing has had the custom

207
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:54,159
of picking out son-in-laws before the posts.

208
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,159
Those people are waiting eagerly for the day

209
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,599
the results are posted.

210
00:14:57,599 --> 00:14:58,799
Watching outside the exam courtyard,

211
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,359
seeing who passed,

212
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:01,520
and they snatch him into their own carriage!

213
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:03,280
Thus forcing him to marry their own daughter!

214
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,559
We must be careful so our Second Son

215
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:07,039
isn't snatched away.

216
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,400
Those people are mostly town peddlers,

217
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,840
merchants of the land.

218
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,000
Don't mention merchants again!

219
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:21,239
A merchant is one thing.

220
00:15:21,239 --> 00:15:25,280
But Second Son's temper.

221
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,440
You know,

222
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,039
if he's bent on being stubborn,

223
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:31,039
I don't know who he will pick,

224
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,760
and

225
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,080
it will affect his future career as an official.

226
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,599
He's keeping a singing girl outside.

227
00:15:39,599 --> 00:15:40,359
Did he think about

228
00:15:40,359 --> 00:15:42,359
his government career then?

229
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:48,799
If we can get our Second Son

230
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:50,479
to chase that woman away, that will be great.

231
00:15:51,479 --> 00:15:53,719
But with his temperament?

232
00:15:54,479 --> 00:15:56,239
He surely won't be willing.

233
00:15:56,239 --> 00:15:58,119
He dares?

234
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:01,559
Whether he passes this exam or not,

235
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,479
he must separate from

236
00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:03,280
that woman regardless.

237
00:16:04,479 --> 00:16:05,479
If he refuses,

238
00:16:05,479 --> 00:16:06,520
I will break his legs.

239
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:09,960
Don't fret, My Lord.

240
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,200
He's become

241
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,320
more mature lately.

242
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,640
And also,

243
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,840
no one passes the exam on first try.

244
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,239
If he didn't pass today,

245
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:24,320
don't you scold him.

246
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Second Brother!

247
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,200
Your entire family has mobilized.

248
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:45,159
They're so scared if you made to the top of the roster,

249
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:45,960
their brother will be snatched away.

250
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,559
Even the younger sisters are here as your guards.

251
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:55,840
Here, here.

252
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,200
That man seems quite good.

253
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,799
Handsome in appearance and a great air about him.

254
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,680
He's got that unique air

255
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,119
about him.

256
00:17:07,479 --> 00:17:09,119
If he passes,

257
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,800
Brother Wang,

258
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,680
you must not try to fight me for him.

259
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,599
Landlord Lu, you take him all you want.

260
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,479
Why?

261
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,479
He's Gu Tingye.

262
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,280
I will not

263
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,040
fight you for him.

264
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,280
That's actually him?

265
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,959
That charming vanguard.

266
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,880
Beguiling conqueror of the peony.

267
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,439
My daughter? I'd rather keep her with me forever

268
00:17:31,439 --> 00:17:33,920
than to have him ruin her!

269
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,920
That's true!

270
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,319
Did you hear that?

271
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:41,160
No one wants to find one like me

272
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,319
for their son-in-law.

273
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:48,719
Let's go.

274
00:17:58,319 --> 00:17:59,599
What is it? What ranking?

275
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,839
I…

276
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:04,920
I didn't see the Young Master's name.

277
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,319
How can that be?

278
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:07,160
We all

279
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,640
looked at all corners.

280
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,599
We really didn't.

281
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,119
I'll go personally.

282
00:18:13,199 --> 00:18:14,319
Mother.

283
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:15,760
Don't go.

284
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,640
All four had their eyes opened wide

285
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,920
and looked through for so long

286
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,800
and didn't find it, so it means I didn't pass.

287
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,959
What if they are blind

288
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:22,800
and missed it?

289
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:27,479
Mother.

290
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,079
Mother.

291
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:31,959
That's her temper.

292
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,719
After she looks,

293
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:34,719
she'll give up.

294
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,319
He made it. He made it!

295
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:42,239
Second Brother, there!

296
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:43,760
Second Brother passed!

297
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:44,920
Second Brother.

298
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,920
You passed! Great!

299
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:50,439
You passed! You're among the top!

300
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:51,199
You placed thirteenth!

301
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,280
Go back home to tell them this good news.

302
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,160
Congratulations, Second Brother.

303
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,280
Thanks to the heavens and earth.

304
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,719
That aura! Handsome and talented.

305
00:18:59,719 --> 00:19:00,880
A great

306
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,839
pillar of the nation!

307
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:04,239
Let my daughter marry to you!

308
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:07,079
What are you doing? What are you doing?

309
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:08,640
Did you pass?

310
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,920
If I have good news, I'll come and tell you.

311
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,800
Alright.

312
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,599
Brother, where are you?

313
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:23,479
I'm looking!

314
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:29,000
I've disappointed.

315
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,280
Passing on the first try is as rare as

316
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,920
phoenix feathers and unicorn horns.

317
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,479
Not many since our nation was established.

318
00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:35,359
If you don't pass this time,

319
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:37,680
all you have to do is take it again.

320
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:52,640
Little Sixth Miss!

321
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,280
Greetings, Second Uncle.

322
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,239
Can't be.

323
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:10,520
How can there not be?

324
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,160
What are you all doing all dazed up?

325
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,560
Hurry and look.

326
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:19,319
It's impossible

327
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,079
that I'm not there.

328
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:21,199
I wrote it and I know I made it!

329
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:22,000
shut up

330
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:22,880
Young Master,

331
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,640
this must be your first try at the exam.

332
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:24,719
You're so young

333
00:20:24,719 --> 00:20:25,640
and you'll have lots of opportunities in the future.

334
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:26,880
If you don't pass this time,

335
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,359
just come again next time.

336
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,520
What did you say? What did you say?

337
00:20:30,719 --> 00:20:31,400
Young Master.

338
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,520
How can I not pass?

339
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,599
What are you saying, you scum!

340
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:36,520
You didn't pass

341
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,319
and that means you didn't.

342
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,199
Hurry and go back now instead of embarrassing ourselves.

343
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,800
Let's go.

344
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:44,400
Let's go.

345
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,560
Go back.

346
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,520
Go back to the manor.

347
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,560
Stop the carriage.

348
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,199
What for?

349
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,199
I think Sheng Changbai made it to the top roster.

350
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,560
We were classmates for a long time,

351
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,599
so propriety calls for me to congratulate him.

352
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,520
Yes, yes.

353
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,800
That's the proper etiquette.

354
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,359
You go.

355
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:36,439
I can't afford that embarrassment.

356
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:50,760
Brother Changbai.

357
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:53,079
Actually,

358
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:55,239
Brother Yuanruo's family is so mighty.

359
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,199
He doesn't need the Imperial exam

360
00:21:57,199 --> 00:21:57,959
to have a prospect.

361
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:01,040
It's not an issue of prospects.

362
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,160
Young Lord has cultivated himself

363
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,280
for this exam.

364
00:22:04,479 --> 00:22:05,400
He didn't pass

365
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,280
and he must be very sad.

366
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:08,439
What's there to be sad about?

367
00:22:08,719 --> 00:22:09,560
In time, he can just submit a memorial

368
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,319
and ask for an official position

369
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:11,719
based on his family merit.

370
00:22:16,199 --> 00:22:17,119
Like me, didn't pass.

371
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:25,319
Congratulations to you two sisters.

372
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,640
Brother Yuanruo, you needn't be sad.

373
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,599
Not many pass

374
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:29,520
with top scores on first try.

375
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,880
Many are still taking the exam

376
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,880
at age seventy or eighty!

377
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,319
I'm fine.

378
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,719
Sixth Sister.

379
00:22:40,719 --> 00:22:41,640
We've not seen each other in so long.

380
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,239
Are you well?

381
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,640
I am fine. Very well.

382
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,119
I haven't seen you in so long either,

383
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:50,079
Brother Yuanruo.

384
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,280
Why don't you ask me

385
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,000
if I'm well?

386
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,680
Your face is shiny with rosy hues

387
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,359
and your voice is sonorous.

388
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,160
One can see clearly you are well

389
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,479
and there's no need to ask.

390
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,920
Young Lord, the Imperial exam is extremely difficult

391
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,800
and that's well-known to everyone.

392
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:11,079
Take the next exam and you'll surely pass.

393
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:14,680
You are really willing to believe

394
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,079
I can still pass?

395
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,719
I believe in you.

396
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,160
Young Lord, your talent is outstanding.

397
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,319
Fifth Sister is most aware of it.

398
00:23:23,239 --> 00:23:24,280
We all know.

399
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:24,959
Yes, yes.

400
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,040
Don't despair.

401
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,719
These words of yours,

402
00:23:29,719 --> 00:23:30,640
I shall mark to heart.

403
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,359
Next Imperial exam,

404
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:34,599
I must pass it.

405
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:39,560
Then let me bid farewell first.

406
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,560
Did you see that?

407
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,719
Earlier, Heng'er looked like

408
00:23:56,719 --> 00:23:58,160
he was struck by frost.

409
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,199
But a few words

410
00:24:00,199 --> 00:24:01,119
exchanged with the Sheng girls,

411
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,359
and he's elated with all weariness gone.

412
00:24:05,439 --> 00:24:07,839
Those chits from little households.

413
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,199
They are not easy.

414
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,000
Sheng family's girls are pretty.

415
00:24:18,239 --> 00:24:19,359
I mean, if Heng'er

416
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:20,560
likes one of them,

417
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,280
we should look into it,

418
00:24:22,479 --> 00:24:23,520
see if the girl is promised to another.

419
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,000
Are you senile?

420
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,439
Does their house have a noble title?

421
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,760
He passed.

422
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,760
Second Brother.

423
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,400
Actually, not passing isn't such a big deal.

424
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,359
I'll accompany you

425
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:48,119
study a few more years.

426
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,800
Then, we should return.

427
00:24:56,479 --> 00:24:57,760
I don't want to go anywhere.

428
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:03,599
Actually, there aren't many

429
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:04,719
like that Su House.

430
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,719
Most

431
00:25:05,719 --> 00:25:06,560
don't pass.

432
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:07,760
Even the Duke Qi Manor one,

433
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,040
theirs didn't pass either.

434
00:25:14,199 --> 00:25:14,959
I finally know.

435
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,839
Why my maternal grandfather, back then,

436
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,680
insisted on making my mother marry into Marquis Manor.

437
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,280
Those merchant families snatching top scorers

438
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,640
are like my Bai House.

439
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,560
All for the daughters' next half of their lives.

440
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:33,239
I had thought

441
00:25:33,239 --> 00:25:34,800
I had higher resolve than others.

442
00:25:36,239 --> 00:25:37,160
I didn't imagine,

443
00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:39,280
that I failed to roster.

444
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,920
And it turns I am no different than they are.

445
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:45,640
Second Brother,

446
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,640
you are the legitimate heir of the Marquis Manor.

447
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,640
You

448
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,920
are different from the rest!

449
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,199
I am not much different

450
00:25:53,199 --> 00:25:54,640
than the rest.

451
00:25:55,439 --> 00:25:56,800
You are different from them indeed.

452
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,880
You only came out

453
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,479
of your resolve.

454
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:07,319
And this resolve has dissipated.

455
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:12,640
You didn't make it on the first try

456
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,359
and there's a next time.

457
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,119
Don't

458
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:16,560
be so hopeless.

459
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,079
Hurry.

460
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:30,760
Second Brother!

461
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,359
Second Brother.

462
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:36,560
Hey, slower.

463
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,520
Son.

464
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,239
Mother.

465
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:40,680
My son.

466
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,119
You didn't disappoint me!

467
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,160
You made it worthwhile

468
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,599
that I gave birth to you and raised you!

469
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:47,000
My son.

470
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,800
Changbai.

471
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,880
You've added honor to the Sheng House.

472
00:26:51,719 --> 00:26:52,839
I have not put to shame

473
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:53,560
Father's hope in me.

474
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:56,359
Don't you say that.

475
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:57,640
You're just the best!

476
00:26:58,319 --> 00:26:59,640
Hurry. Hurry

477
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,239
and ease my son with some food and drinks.

478
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,719
Let's hold a celebration banquet. A banquet to thank the teacher!

479
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:07,119
Set off five kilometer of firecrackers.

480
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:08,680
Bestow porridge and scatter coins!

481
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,880
Set off firecrackers?

482
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,680
Of course. It's such a happy event.

483
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,040
Don't we need to set off

484
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,880
the firecrackers to congratulate?

485
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,040
Five kilometer of firecrackers!

486
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,239
Great then.

487
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,359
Big Madam

488
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,359
will just be more haughty now.

489
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:43,319
That Rulan is going to

490
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:44,319
step on my head now.

491
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:50,040
What's the dazing around for?

492
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,800
Hurry and go in.

493
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,040
Don't show yourself.

494
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,319
Second Brother passed.

495
00:27:59,319 --> 00:27:59,920
Mother

496
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,680
Mother.

497
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,719
Congratulations to Mother.

498
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,599
Bai'er didn't disappoint us

499
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:07,439
and made it to the top roster.

500
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,119
Great.

501
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:10,640
I already found out.

502
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,239
Everyone come and sit.

503
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:18,359
Let me ask you.

504
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,959
What's the loud bustling

505
00:28:20,959 --> 00:28:22,239
outside about?

506
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,400
I told them to set off firecrackers.

507
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:25,680
Bai'er scored top marks.

508
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,359
Today at our family banquet,

509
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:29,800
we'll all chime in to celebrate.

510
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:32,280
You're raising a ruckus,

511
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,800
so the entire capital knows

512
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,119
that the Sheng son passed?

513
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,880
They all studied at the private academy in our house.

514
00:28:43,199 --> 00:28:45,000
Young Lord Qi didn't pass.

515
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:47,239
Second Son of Gu House didn't pass either.

516
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,719
Our family celebrates

517
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:50,520
with such fanfare.

518
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:53,280
Is that to give Duke and Duchess Qi

519
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,520
along with Marquis Gu a slap in the face?

520
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:02,400
Hurry and go and tell those

521
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,040
who went out procure to return.

522
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:04,800
Have them come back.

523
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,560
We'll close our doors and windows.

524
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,760
That firecrackers and porridge donation,

525
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:10,319
we won't hold it and we won't set it off!

526
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,040
Living in the capital

527
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,599
is so stifling.

528
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,239
Princes and dukes, noble clans,

529
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:19,319
all squeezed together.

530
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,040
And we have to be sensitive to how others feel

531
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,560
This is worse than Yangzhou.

532
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,719
You.

533
00:29:25,719 --> 00:29:26,920
Big Madam,

534
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,040
don't feel deflated.

535
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:30,800
We can close the doors and celebrate

536
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,439
and that's still the same.

537
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,079
Right.

538
00:29:32,199 --> 00:29:33,079
I've already prepared a congratulatory gift

539
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:33,959
for Second Brother.

540
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,119
I've been waiting for him to place

541
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:36,160
on the top roster to gift it to him.

542
00:29:37,239 --> 00:29:39,119
You're the sensible one, Ming girl.

543
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:40,640
Better than your older sisters.

544
00:29:40,959 --> 00:29:42,560
Fifth Sister also prepared a gift.

545
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,239
It's much more precious than mine.

546
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,719
When did I prepare a gift?

547
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,359
Old rules.

548
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:52,079
I prepared yours.

549
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,119
You're the sensible one.

550
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:56,239
We need to make a marriage match for him

551
00:29:56,239 --> 00:29:57,119
or else

552
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:57,880
is too late

553
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,319
for him

554
00:30:00,439 --> 00:30:01,599
This matter can't be rushed.

555
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,680
Why did I insist on disapproving before?

556
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,199
Think.

557
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,959
There's no hope for me

558
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:09,760
to enter the central cabinet in this life.

559
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:11,239
At most, I muddle myself

560
00:30:11,239 --> 00:30:13,520
into a silver-green-colored grand advisor title.

561
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,680
If I can retire honorably

562
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,560
at the court ranking of three

563
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,680
I will be considered very respectful.

564
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,160
If Bai'er doesn't have his wife's family's assistance

565
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,040
how far can he go really?

566
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:23,719
If he's just a talented scholar,

567
00:30:23,959 --> 00:30:26,160
then which house will be willing to come assist him?

568
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:29,000
Big Madam, you must not blame him

569
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,439
for not setting a marriage prospect for Bai'er.

570
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,599
This is what I did to him

571
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:33,959
back then too.

572
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,000
At the time,

573
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,160
he passed and rostered,

574
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,800
and that was why I could afford the shame

575
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,719
to propose marriage to you at your Wang House.

576
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:45,239
Mother is right.

577
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,359
My Wang House is

578
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:47,520
quite accomplished.

579
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,479
Mother.

580
00:30:50,479 --> 00:30:53,520
Yesterday, my sister came to visit.

581
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,959
She brought her niece on her husband's side, Yun'er.

582
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,079
I saw that Yun'er has

583
00:30:58,079 --> 00:30:59,680
both great appearance and temperament.

584
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:04,000
I've seen Yun'er when she was little.

585
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,800
She's pretty good indeed.

586
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,520
When she has someone she's fond of later on

587
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,760
and about to marry,

588
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,119
let me know,

589
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:14,119
so I can send a nice gift.

590
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,560
Yes.

591
00:31:20,959 --> 00:31:23,119
Bai'er rostered at a young age.

592
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:24,560
His talent is rare.

593
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,479
What marriage?

594
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,319
Let us discuss this out slowly.

595
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:28,280
We can't rush.

596
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,359
Yes, you are very right in that conclusion.

597
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,520
How many times did I tell you?

598
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,199
Don't go roam around wildly before the exam

599
00:31:42,199 --> 00:31:42,959
and you wouldn't listen.

600
00:31:43,199 --> 00:31:44,040
If you put that effort

601
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,040
you have for wine and entertainment

602
00:31:45,199 --> 00:31:47,199
into studying for the exam,

603
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:48,839
then today you might have been

604
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:50,439
listed at the top too.

605
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,359
We wouldn't need them to

606
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:52,479
wield their might at us.

607
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,359
You've caused me to be scolded by your father too,

608
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:57,239
saying I am too lax with you.

609
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,359
These last couple days,

610
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:01,959
Father's been staying at Weirui Balcony.

611
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,760
He doesn't even come to take a look at us.

612
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,280
Brother's the only one that didn't roster

613
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,359
and it's implicated

614
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:07,199
Mistress Lin and I to suffer too.

615
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:09,239
And that chit Rulan.

616
00:32:09,239 --> 00:32:11,040
Her tail is about to point up to the sky!

617
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,800
Can't even walk straight.

618
00:32:13,719 --> 00:32:15,079
One incompetent man

619
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:16,199
makes three suffer.

620
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:19,319
Passing on first try at the exam

621
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:20,520
is as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns.

622
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,680
It's more common

623
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,520
to not pass after seventeen or eighteen years still.

624
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,800
Then how did Second Brother pass?

625
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,640
Didn't you say

626
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,640
your essays are better than his?

627
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,800
If I don't blame you,

628
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,880
then I'm supposed to blame myself instead?

629
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,880
If I were a man

630
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,640
and I could go out to take the exam,

631
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:36,079
who'd put hopes in you?

632
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:40,920
Second Brother's sister

633
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,599
is always burning incense

634
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:42,439
and praying to Buddha for him.

635
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,800
Praying for him and doing needlework for him.

636
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:47,280
How great is my sister though?

637
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,640
Even the knee guards for the exam yard

638
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,520
were gifts from Minglan.

639
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,520
You're just thinking about reciting

640
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,520
and writing poetry all day,

641
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:53,319
and marrying

642
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:54,359
into a marquis house!

643
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,560
Or else, fighting Rulan for attention?

644
00:32:56,439 --> 00:32:57,439
Hopes in me?

645
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:00,319
You want me to do needlework for you?

646
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,599
You're always

647
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:02,959
surrounded tightly

648
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:03,839
by those witches in your room.

649
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:05,640
What do you want me to do?

650
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,719
You all shut up.

651
00:33:08,239 --> 00:33:09,040
What's the arguing for?

652
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,079
This isn't some great act.

653
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:11,959
Some honorable deed.

654
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:13,439
If others hear you,

655
00:33:13,439 --> 00:33:14,560
you will have no honor either.

656
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,239
And you.

657
00:33:21,239 --> 00:33:23,280
You said you ran out of stamina for the test.

658
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,439
But you come back home,

659
00:33:25,439 --> 00:33:26,680
and you've got energy to argue with your sister?

660
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,079
Let me tell you.

661
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:29,359
Your sister's talent is higher than Xie Daoyun!

662
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,640
What's wrong with her wanting to marry high?

663
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,199
It's you instead.

664
00:33:34,199 --> 00:33:35,800
If you can't pass the civil exam

665
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,280
and can't get an official duty,

666
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,800
then you might have to depend on

667
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,640
your sister's husband for support!

668
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,560
Who?

669
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,880
Who wants another's support?

670
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,719
Among my good buddies,

671
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:47,680
so many are sons of aristocrats and nobility.

672
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,239
Which one couldn't help me?

673
00:33:49,239 --> 00:33:50,280
Who needs my brother-in-law.

674
00:33:50,719 --> 00:33:52,560
And you, Molan.

675
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,560
Stop saying I didn't pass!

676
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,520
Next time I take the exam, I'm sure I'll pass!

677
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:58,160
Mother,

678
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,000
look how he's scolding me.

679
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,079
You.

680
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:00,800
Alright.

681
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,920
Let me tell you,

682
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,160
your father's gleeful lately and your look now,

683
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,800
if it annoys him,

684
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,599
he just won't come even more so!

685
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,760
And I've got Yangzhou matters

686
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,320
I'm busy with.

687
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,879
Wine, wine.

688
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,120
You said it well!

689
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,439
Yes.

690
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,679
There's a matter

691
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,520
that I don't understand, no matter what.

692
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,800
Your essays? I know them.

693
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,159
How can they not pass?

694
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,439
Where was the loss?

695
00:34:48,439 --> 00:34:50,199
It must be me.

696
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,040
I regarded myself too highly.

697
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,000
Actually,

698
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,320
my essays aren't so great.

699
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,320
I hear,

700
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,959
Duke and Duchess Qi.

701
00:35:05,919 --> 00:35:07,280
The second day after the roster was posted,

702
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,840
they went to pay a visit at the main proctor's home,

703
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,360
asking the reason why he didn't pass.

704
00:35:13,959 --> 00:35:16,320
Did Marquis Gu not go and ask then?

705
00:35:23,959 --> 00:35:26,639
Princess Pingning of Duke Qi Manor.

706
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:29,000
She loves her son more than life.

707
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,879
The elder in my home?

708
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:33,479
He would rather that I bury myself in a hole

709
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,520
and never come out to embarrass him!

710
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,520
How can he possibly go and ask it for me?

711
00:35:36,959 --> 00:35:39,919
Come, now. Drink wine.

712
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,399
My father's only a

713
00:35:56,399 --> 00:35:58,719
fifth-ranking minor official in court.

714
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,479
He regards himself noble and virtuous.

715
00:36:02,479 --> 00:36:04,239
Never socializes or entertains.

716
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,439
He only knows to press me to study to death

717
00:36:06,439 --> 00:36:07,639
and I'm a concubine-born at that!

718
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:09,800
Those princes and nobles are born lucky!

719
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,199
What's wrong with being a concubine-born?

720
00:36:11,399 --> 00:36:13,280
Are all legitimate heirs guaranteed of success?

721
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,040
Your elder brother at home,

722
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,800
I've never seen him smile ever!

723
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,639
A man like him,

724
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:21,600
even if he rosters high,

725
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,800
he will only be faced with struggles

726
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,040
at the government post.

727
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,439
I think

728
00:36:25,439 --> 00:36:26,280
Elder Brother Youguang is right.

729
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:28,439
You have to look at the situation clearly.

730
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,439
His Majesty doesn't have a son.

731
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:32,399
All the high ministers

732
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,879
are all dying to kneel inside the hall daily.

733
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,040
Begging the Emperor to adopt from the Imperial clan.

734
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,719
Prince Yong is vulgar.

735
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,600
Prince Yan is capable.

736
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,719
The world knows.

737
00:36:42,919 --> 00:36:44,159
You mean Prince Yan, he's going to be . . .

738
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,560
Just keep it to yourself.

739
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,320
No need to say it aloud.

740
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:48,719
Yes, yes.

741
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:49,479
I understand.

742
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,399
Prince Yan is of noble birth.

743
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,679
His mother's clan are third-generation high ministers.

744
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:57,560
Glory and honor never end!

745
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,959
All the men that work for him are all capable and fierce.

746
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:01,479
I can't think of anyone else

747
00:37:01,479 --> 00:37:02,719
besides him in the Imperial court!

748
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,760
It's nice to be an Imperial clansman.

749
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:07,879
You don't need the exam.

750
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,679
You don't need to toil and study by the cold window.

751
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,000
Slowly.

752
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,719
Where did you go?

753
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,159
I've been waiting here

754
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:33,120
all night without sleeping!

755
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,479
I was going to send someone to look for you

756
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,560
but I was afraid your father would know

757
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,840
and Weirui Balcony would have one against us.

758
00:37:36,959 --> 00:37:38,159
Where did you go?

759
00:37:38,959 --> 00:37:40,479
Before I left yesterday,

760
00:37:40,479 --> 00:37:41,520
didn't I tell you?

761
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,040
Third Young Master Qiu wanted to invite good friends

762
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:45,000
and wanted me to accompany him.

763
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:47,280
I've always been like this,

764
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,360
so why this alarm now?

765
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:49,959
You're usually not

766
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:51,439
coming home at night?

767
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:53,560
Then did you go and sleep

768
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,280
on some whore's bed last night?

769
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:57,399
Mother,

770
00:37:57,399 --> 00:37:59,080
must you speak so provokingly?

771
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,439
Not a whore.

772
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,320
Flower-adorned beauty is what she is.

773
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,679
You loser.

774
00:38:06,959 --> 00:38:08,560
You fail to make the list,

775
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,879
and you go to the brothel and drink wine?

776
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:12,520
If your father finds out,

777
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,000
what will happen?

778
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,879
Have you thought it?

779
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,760
So what if

780
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,399
he finds out.

781
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:20,879
Who is that Young Master Qiu?

782
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,719
His father. His older uncle.

783
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:26,639
They are officials serving Prince Yan.

784
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:27,879
The current monarch has no sons.

785
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:30,040
When Prince Yan ascends,

786
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,800
he becomes the new Emperor.

787
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,719
I have my reason

788
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:34,760
to socialize with these friends.

789
00:38:36,479 --> 00:38:37,600
Didn't you say

790
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,600
if I didn't pass the exam,

791
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,239
I will need my brother-in-law's support?

792
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,120
I just won't!

793
00:38:43,959 --> 00:38:44,840
Slower.

794
00:38:49,439 --> 00:38:50,560
Prince Yan?

795
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:53,080
Hurry and make some sobering tonic

796
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,000
for Third Young Master.

797
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,280
Yes, don't worry, Mistress Lin.

798
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:07,879
Marquis,

799
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:09,199
you've come this early.

800
00:39:09,439 --> 00:39:11,560
Is it over the matter

801
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,719
of your Second Son failing to roster?

802
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:15,320
My humble son lacks talent

803
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,439
and I knew he wouldn't pass.

804
00:39:17,479 --> 00:39:19,320
But if he wants to retake the exam,

805
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,800
I must ask clearly.

806
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:22,639
What he lacks,

807
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:24,040
so he doesn't repeat this again?

808
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,560
I really don't know how

809
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,879
I can even begin on this.

810
00:39:30,879 --> 00:39:32,080
Why?

811
00:39:33,879 --> 00:39:35,120
Yesterday,

812
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,679
Duke and Duchess Qi came to ask too.

813
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,239
Their Young Lord Qi,

814
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,239
he's innately-talented and smart.

815
00:39:44,439 --> 00:39:47,439
His essays are beautifully written,

816
00:39:47,439 --> 00:39:48,719
but they lack a backbone.

817
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,399
If he can

818
00:39:51,399 --> 00:39:52,280
grind on it more,

819
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,280
it's hopeful if he retakes later on.

820
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,199
Yes, yes.

821
00:39:57,199 --> 00:39:59,040
But what about my humble son's essay?

822
00:40:03,879 --> 00:40:06,760
This is why I sigh.

823
00:40:07,879 --> 00:40:09,560
Your son's essays.

824
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,879
I've seen them with the two other proctors.

825
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:16,479
They were considered excellent text

826
00:40:16,479 --> 00:40:17,239
and imposing in vigor.

827
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,040
His writing reminds me

828
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,919
of Duke Wenzheng's.

829
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:23,320
That's an over-praise.

830
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,840
So by rules,

831
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,719
he should be listed.

832
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:31,360
But then, why did he not end up on the roster?

833
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,959
Find two men

834
00:40:53,959 --> 00:40:55,360
and go fetch that scum!

835
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,760
Second Young Master is already back.

836
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,600
He's drunk and asleep.

837
00:41:02,879 --> 00:41:04,600
He's got enough shame to drink wine?

838
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,639
Beat him to wake him up!

839
00:41:06,919 --> 00:41:07,800
I don't dare.

840
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:24,239
That scum!

841
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,120
You can still sleep?

842
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,080
Do you know

843
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,000
what wreckage you have caused!

844
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,239
Do you!

845
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,479
Not passing the test is considered making wreckage?

846
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,679
Does the law of Gu Family

847
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:45,959
allow one to live?

848
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:46,959
Who's that

849
00:41:46,959 --> 00:41:47,639
Yang Wuduan?

850
00:41:49,399 --> 00:41:50,399
You return to the capital

851
00:41:50,399 --> 00:41:52,040
to take the exam,

852
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,159
but you indulge in the entertainment outlets.

853
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,600
It's one thing if you just make some lousy poetry.

854
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,399
But you get yourself and drunk and say what?

855
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,840
Passing the test isn't as good as attaching yourself to brothels?

856
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,080
The Emperor made it absolute

857
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,120
to disallow him to retake the test!

858
00:42:04,399 --> 00:42:05,479
But for a thing like that,

859
00:42:06,479 --> 00:42:07,320
you roll your tongue wildly?

860
00:42:09,439 --> 00:42:11,199
Scholar Wuduan is a rare talent.

861
00:42:14,479 --> 00:42:16,080
Can't be that you're coming

862
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:16,840
to beat me over his matter too?

863
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:20,239
I can't beat you little scum?

864
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,320
You went out and spoke wildly outside

865
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,560
lamenting the injustice to Yang Wuduan.

866
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:25,399
Those words

867
00:42:25,399 --> 00:42:26,560
went to the Emperor's ears.

868
00:42:27,479 --> 00:42:28,800
He had you scratched out

869
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,679
from the top-three ranking!

870
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,399
And he said you could only retake at age of fifty

871
00:42:32,399 --> 00:42:33,639
like that Yang Wuduan!

872
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,679
If you had been good,

873
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:37,080
stayed at home,

874
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:38,679
and had not gone to those brothels

875
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:39,800
with your rogue friends,

876
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,560
then how would you fall to this plight?

877
00:42:42,679 --> 00:42:44,360
And you say I don't give you a way to survive?

878
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:52,560
I know!

879
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,639
I've got it!

880
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:56,760
What are you doing?
