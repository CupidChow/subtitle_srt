00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Ming Lan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,959
Episode 16

3
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,480
Second Brother Gu is here.

4
00:01:46,279 --> 00:01:47,480
The one next to him is Chief Wei.

5
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,639
Miss Yun from Qiyun House is here too.

6
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,959
Second Uncle Gu?

7
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,000
You're getting the generations

8
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,879
all mixed up.

9
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,400
Second Brother Gu.

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,080
Look at my foolish older brother.

11
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,680
He can't even

12
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,480
behave with dignity.

13
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,239
Seeing how Qiu House is

14
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,319
getting abandoned by His Majesty,

15
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,039
he starts to curry favor with Gu House right away.

16
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,119
That little scheme of his.

17
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,119
Everyone can tell it.

18
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,160
Shameful.

19
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:28,880
Your second brother, Changbai

20
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,559
is so busy at Imperial Hanlin Academy.

21
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,080
But he's got the leisure

22
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,759
to go see the chief of a brothel.

23
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:38,279
Let him go, Mother.

24
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,800
Mother, I want to play Chui Wan.

25
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,759
Go then.

26
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:56,039
Big Madam,

27
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,199
Yanran is over there.

28
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,520
Go then.

29
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,759
It's not easy

30
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:03,639
to come out to have fun.

31
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:12,479
Madam Wang,

32
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,039
I have been waiting for you for a long time.

33
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,320
I arranged a seat for you.

34
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:17,720
Come with me.

35
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,279
Yanran.

36
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:33,960
Minglan.

37
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:40,800
You are here too.

38
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,399
Your “hundred birds looking at wind” embroidery,

39
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:43,800
I'm almost done getting it mounted for you.

40
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:46,800
But your thread wasn't great this time,

41
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,679
it almost blotched.

42
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,360
Blotched?

43
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,039
What should I do?

44
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,080
Then it can't be gifted out,

45
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,039
my step-mother will have words for me

46
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:53,839
for sure again.

47
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,759
Don't worry,

48
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,600
I added fish gelatin to it

49
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,600
and preserved the color,

50
00:03:58,559 --> 00:04:01,199
but now the

51
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,320
prop method won't work,

52
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,320
and the wood board is heavy.

53
00:04:04,559 --> 00:04:06,639
I want to try the pad method.

54
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,639
I'm pretty sure it will work.

55
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:09,520
Tomorrow, I'll be sure to deliver

56
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,039
two bottles of Cuoren wine.

57
00:04:21,559 --> 00:04:23,160
Why isn't Brother Yuanruo here yet?

58
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,440
Didn't he say

59
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,480
he would be here?

60
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,359
Miss, look.

61
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:30,959
Rong House's Miss Feiyan is here too,

62
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,040
so that Young Lord must be here.

63
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:36,119
Princess Jiacheng and Rong Feiyan

64
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:37,000
are already here.

65
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,399
Brother Yuanruo will naturally be here too.

66
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,239
I think the

67
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:43,480
thread from Li House is the best,

68
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,720
but it's expensive,

69
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:47,119
so I thought the shop under the bridge would do.

70
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:48,239
I didn't realize.

71
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,839
You are not allowed to hit it.

72
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,920
That ball is mine!

73
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:01,839
Your Second Brother

74
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:02,440
and Third Sister are here too.

75
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,040
They're here.

76
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,559
Princess Jiacheng from Prince Yong's house

77
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:06,160
is here too.

78
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,200
My Third Sister will come for sure.

79
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:11,600
Miss Rong,

80
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,160
I'm very happy that you are here.

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,119
Madam Wu.

82
00:05:15,119 --> 00:05:17,000
Quick, come in and take a seat.

83
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,959
This way, please.

84
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,000
Young Lord, make a poem.

85
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,320
Yes, Young Lord, make a poem.

86
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,679
Make a poem. Yes, a poem!

87
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:14,839
Brother Qi.

88
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,279
”The bee's waist faces the butterfly's wing.

89
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:18,600
Hangover faces residual sobriety”.

90
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,119
That last word rhymes with your name of Heng.

91
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:21,839
So let's use that as the final rhyme

92
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,079
on eight-syllable stanzas.

93
00:06:23,359 --> 00:06:24,559
You make a good poem,

94
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:26,119
and I'll let you take this stew.

95
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:33,799
Alright. For this fish stew,

96
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:35,160
I must make a poem then.

97
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:55,200
The willow leaves are like bright blades.

98
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,559
The lead is half-gone.

99
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:05,359
At the pavilion for a gathering today.

100
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,399
Then departing after today until next time.

101
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,440
Excellent.

102
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,799
Brother Yuanruo's poem is excellent.

103
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,239
Spring breeze as sharp as a knife.

104
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,200
As sharp as a willow leaf.

105
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,839
Tender grass both yellow and green.

106
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:31,040
Akin to a young maiden's mirror on the dressing table.

107
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,640
Her eyebrows bent like the willow leaf.

108
00:07:33,679 --> 00:07:36,559
But upon meeting today,

109
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:37,640
never meeting again.

110
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,799
That's a pun in each line.

111
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:44,640
You praise me, Fourth Miss.

112
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,119
Brother Yuanruo, your poem is beautiful,

113
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:49,880
but it feels sad.

114
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,839
How about changing it to…

115
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,160
"brush bestowed upon a lilac town"?

116
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,600
Does it sound more lively?

117
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,480
Great, love the lilac town.

118
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,720
Young Lord, when did you ever meet

119
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,320
such a clever miss?

120
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,200
This is Jiying Alley's

121
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,279
Minister Sheng's Fourth Daughter.

122
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,679
You met them

123
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:11,959
in the past.

124
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,600
I remember now.

125
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,399
It was when I visited

126
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,440
the Sheng family with my mother.

127
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:20,040
The Miss

128
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,559
who was startled by the screen.

129
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:24,440
Greetings, Sixth Young Master Liang.

130
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,359
That day, my younger sister was reckless

131
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:28,399
and we offended you.

132
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,679
No matter.

133
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,840
But the ‘cheng' in half undone,

134
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,919
and ‘cheng' in lilac town are repeats.

135
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,520
This poem is ruined by it.

136
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,960
Yes, it's repeated.

137
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,039
Go, go.

138
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,479
You've not finished reading half a book,

139
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,200
so what do you know?

140
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,880
This Miss Sheng's grandfather

141
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,599
placed third in the Hanlin Exam.

142
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:45,599
They are the original scholars.

143
00:08:47,719 --> 00:08:49,080
Fourth Miss Sheng,

144
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,640
this outdoor fair my mother put together

145
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,599
has everything.

146
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,760
There are polo, Chui Wan, fishing and hunting.

147
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I wonder

148
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,960
what you like.

149
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,479
How is Imperial Tutor lately?

150
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:05,080
Grandfather is doing well.

151
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,000
It's just that he and Grandmother

152
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,239
are worried about my marriage.

153
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,880
After I have a prospect,

154
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:10,960
I think

155
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,919
they will retire to their hometown.

156
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,679
Minglan, at that time,

157
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,559
in Bianjing,

158
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,559
you'll be the only one left for me.

159
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,479
What are you afraid of?

160
00:09:21,599 --> 00:09:23,400
If you can be your own boss,

161
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,520
that's better than anything.

162
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:27,840
Later on,

163
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,159
if Imperial Tutor Yu

164
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,359
really goes to Xuzhou,

165
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,679
then come to me.

166
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,960
I won!

167
00:09:41,599 --> 00:09:44,359
Being motherless is like being fatherless too.

168
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,559
I really don't know

169
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:47,880
how I will manage to live.

170
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,520
You and I both don't have our mothers anymore,

171
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:55,119
but we still

172
00:09:55,119 --> 00:09:56,200
have grandparents who protect us.

173
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,559
What's there to be scared of?

174
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:59,159
We don't lack at all.

175
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,840
No matter what anyone says,

176
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,880
you're the legitimate-line eldest daughter

177
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,840
of Imperial Tutor Yu.

178
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:05,080
You're much better off than so many.

179
00:10:05,719 --> 00:10:07,320
Hurry now. Straighten your back.

180
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,960
Third Miss of Yu House wins the match.

181
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,159
The prize is awarded, a white jade bracelet!

182
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:34,799
Little Sister.

183
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:35,359
Second Brother!

184
00:10:35,359 --> 00:10:36,320
Congratulations.

185
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,000
Thank you.

186
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:42,719
Rest up.

187
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:44,239
A new match.

188
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:46,719
This match's prize

189
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:50,119
is a gold pin with silk twists.

190
00:10:55,719 --> 00:10:56,559
Look,

191
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:57,280
how pretty is that gold silk!

192
00:10:57,599 --> 00:10:59,039
I want that gold pin, Second Brother.

193
00:10:59,039 --> 00:10:59,760
You help me!

194
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,280
Miss.

195
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,520
Miss?

196
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,000
What's wrong?

197
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,719
It's my late mother's item.

198
00:11:35,239 --> 00:11:36,359
What?

199
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,479
That's my mother's dowry for me.

200
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:43,479
My name is engraved on it.

201
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,880
I lost it a few years ago,

202
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,760
and haven't been able to find it.

203
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:49,440
How could it be?

204
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,840
When I went on tour

205
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,919
with Father a few years ago,

206
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:56,640
things would go missing from my room often.

207
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,400
I asked, but couldn't find out anything.

208
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,559
I didn't manage it and investigate it either.

209
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,400
I don't have more than one or two accessories

210
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,440
left from Mother.

211
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,679
Minglan.

212
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,719
That pin.

213
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,320
I must get it today.

214
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,200
Didn't you just get a bracelet?

215
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:12,320
A bracelet is a bracelet,

216
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,280
and a pin is a pin.

217
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:14,919
I just want this gold pin.

218
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,640
Not going to help me?

219
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,359
I?

220
00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:21,400
Fine. Don't want to help me?

221
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,719
When I go back, I will tell Grandfather.

222
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,000
I will tell him that

223
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,159
you are not going to

224
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:26,679
the Poetry Society tonight

225
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,200
and that you're secretly going to sleep over

226
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,039
at Wide Cloud Terrace.

227
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:30,280
Please don't.

228
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,520
I agree, okay?

229
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,799
The competition is beginning.

230
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,599
That's

231
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:34,280
what you said.

232
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,239
Thank you, Second Brother.

233
00:12:37,359 --> 00:12:38,719
But the teams are a man and a woman.

234
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Your Second Brother and Third Sister

235
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,239
will definitely be in the same team.

236
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,200
Who will you play with?

237
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,039
I…

238
00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:47,559
Where's your Third Brother?

239
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,640
Third Brother!

240
00:12:52,719 --> 00:12:53,640
Wait for me.

241
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:58,000
Third Brother.

242
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,080
Third Brother. Hello, Second Uncle.

243
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,799
I need your help

244
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:04,119
urgently.

245
00:13:04,119 --> 00:13:05,239
What is it? I…

246
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:06,479
See you later.

247
00:13:12,119 --> 00:13:13,119
What are you doing?

248
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:14,760
I was talking to Second Brother Gu.

249
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,039
Do a favor for Yanran.

250
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,239
What favor?

251
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:19,919
Team up with her to play polo.

252
00:13:20,359 --> 00:13:21,479
I haven't played polo for a long time.

253
00:13:21,479 --> 00:13:22,119
I can't do it.

254
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,479
Go now. You can do it.

255
00:13:24,119 --> 00:13:25,599
Who's that lady?

256
00:13:25,599 --> 00:13:27,119
Why is she crying so miserably?

257
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:32,119
The eldest daughter of the Yu family.

258
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,159
Eldest daughter of the Yu family?

259
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,320
Did you recognize the wrong person?

260
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,520
I am acquainted with the second son of Yu House.

261
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:44,239
I only heard of him having a younger sister

262
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:45,440
who is the third daughter.

263
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:49,159
Darling Second, you may not know.

264
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,000
The eldest daughter was born

265
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,440
to the first main wife of the Fan family.

266
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,880
But later on Madam Fan passed away,

267
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,679
and Lord Yu remarried.

268
00:13:58,239 --> 00:14:00,039
Second Young Master Yu and Third Miss Yu

269
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,159
were born to

270
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:02,080
the new Madam.

271
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,039
The step-wife has control of Yu House.

272
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:09,159
This Miss naturally

273
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:10,599
became superfluous

274
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,200
and she was raised by the grandfather,

275
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:12,799
Imperial Tutor Yu.

276
00:14:14,599 --> 00:14:15,679
Eldest Miss Yu has the most amiable

277
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:18,000
and refined disposition.

278
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:19,799
No matter who seeks knowledge from her,

279
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,200
she is willing to help.

280
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,919
Even people like us

281
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:23,919
who set up a meeting to invite her,

282
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,880
she's never declined us.

283
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,880
Even when you invite her,

284
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,119
she doesn't decline?

285
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,599
Sister Yu,

286
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:44,760
since studying for the exam,

287
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,119
I haven't played polo.

288
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:47,520
I can't guarantee that we will win.

289
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,799
Whether we can do it or not,

290
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:50,679
thank you, Third Brother.

291
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:55,200
Big Sister,

292
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,599
Third Sister is fond of that pin.

293
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,840
Why do you fight with your own sister?

294
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,880
I am not trying to snatch it from my younger sister.

295
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:03,359
Just that this pin

296
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:04,679
is my late mother's item.

297
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:06,520
I don't know

298
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,640
how it became a prize today.

299
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,400
I want to keep it as a memento.

300
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,039
Second Brother, please speak favorably for me

301
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:12,960
to Third Sister.

302
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,400
If you win,

303
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,719
will you still let me have the pin?

304
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,159
I say, how can there be

305
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:21,039
such an older sister like you?

306
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,080
I like

307
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,960
this item

308
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,960
and you want to fight with me over it?

309
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,760
Your polo is very poor.

310
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,320
Won't you embarrass the Yu family?

311
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,080
Forget it.

312
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,840
You lack accessories, is that it?

313
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,080
You can have the jade bracelet then.

314
00:15:39,119 --> 00:15:40,320
I don't want your prize!

315
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,599
It's just that

316
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:42,520
the pin is my late mother's.

317
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:45,000
Younger Sister, may you…

318
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,239
Second Brother, let's go.

319
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,760
Sister!

320
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:34,159
The ball is in!

321
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,840
Pull.

322
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,839
Greetings, Young Lord.

323
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,319
You like to watch polo too?

324
00:18:12,479 --> 00:18:14,439
Scholar Zhuang's academy has ended.

325
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:17,640
I went to your house several times

326
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,119
but I didn't see you.

327
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,040
Scholar Zhuang has already retired to his hometown.

328
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,800
It's getting hot lately

329
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,560
and the knee guards you gifted me.

330
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,959
I have already put them away.

331
00:18:57,199 --> 00:18:58,640
Young Lord. You…

332
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,839
What knee guards?

333
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:01,839
I don't understand.

334
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,359
Sixth Sister, don't be afraid.

335
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,520
I really put them away.

336
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,199
I won't

337
00:19:07,199 --> 00:19:07,920
let another person see them.

338
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,640
May you speak with prudence, Young Lord.

339
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,760
I've not gifted you any knee guards.

340
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,040
You did.

341
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:14,760
I didn't.

342
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,520
You did.

343
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,680
I pushed the Count of Yongchang Manor

344
00:19:27,239 --> 00:19:28,280
to hold this outdoor fair.

345
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,680
And the invitation,

346
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,520
I sent it first to Count of Zhongqin Manor.

347
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,920
I guessed that

348
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,280
once your Eldest Sister knew of it,

349
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,920
she'd surely tell her maiden family about it.

350
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:43,239
If you didn't come this time,

351
00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:44,359
it's fine.

352
00:19:45,239 --> 00:19:46,680
There will be second fair.

353
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,079
A third.

354
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:50,839
A fourth.

355
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:52,760
If you never come out,

356
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,199
then on the Double Seventh Festival.

357
00:19:56,199 --> 00:19:57,280
you will come out,

358
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:58,079
If you still don't come out

359
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,079
for the Double Seventh Festival,

360
00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:01,280
then on the Lantern Festival,

361
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,640
you'd have to come out at least.

362
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,119
I didn't believe that

363
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:07,640
I wouldn't be able to wait for you.

364
00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:09,520
Young Lord.

365
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,280
You are you drunk?

366
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:44,640
I haven't seen you for a long time.

367
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,640
I miss you very much.

368
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,680
Don't say anymore!

369
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:48,800
I…

370
00:21:11,239 --> 00:21:12,160
Third Sister,

371
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,640
this gold pin is my late mother's item.

372
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:16,680
It's showed up here,

373
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,000
but if you are willing to concede it to me,

374
00:21:18,199 --> 00:21:19,520
all the accessories in my jewelry box.

375
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,400
So generous?

376
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,839
Just a gold pin.

377
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:24,000
Actually I don't need it.

378
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,280
But since you want it,

379
00:21:27,439 --> 00:21:29,079
I must have it then.

380
00:21:51,719 --> 00:21:52,680
Ming'er.

381
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:56,160
That pin.

382
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,599
I don't think I can get it back.

383
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,040
Let's leave.

384
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,439
This won't do.

385
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:07,880
I will go in your place.

386
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,599
Xiaotao.

387
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,280
You don't even know

388
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,040
how to ride a horse. How?

389
00:22:49,479 --> 00:22:50,199
She, she...

390
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:53,959
Yes, Young Master.

391
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:55,760
Sixth Miss tricked you again.

392
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,119
She tricked me?

393
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,959
And again?

394
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,520
It went in.

395
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:47,959
Why did you have to

396
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:48,880
feed it to her?

397
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:50,760
I wasn't sending it to her.

398
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,560
I was trying to hit her!

399
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:56,119
It's interesting. Very interesting.

400
00:23:57,439 --> 00:23:58,880
That little miss...

401
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,959
She lives like a sun.

402
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,359
You don't know

403
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,359
her life is very hard.

404
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:15,719
That Sixth Miss of Sheng House reminds me

405
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:17,280
of myself in my youth.

406
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:19,000
Where's Sixth Son?

407
00:24:19,239 --> 00:24:20,359
Get him here

408
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:21,280
to see this skill.

409
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,119
Sixth Young Master's talking over there.

410
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:31,760
Who is that woman?

411
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,280
It's Jinying Alley

412
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,560
Minister Sheng's Fourth Daughter

413
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,280
I want him to come and look at Sixth Miss Sheng.

414
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:42,239
But he's got his eyes on the Fourth Miss Sheng first.

415
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:47,880
What's there to see

416
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,880
about that brow-bending

417
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,079
poetry-reciting coquetry act!

418
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,599
Is he okay?

419
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:36,800
Big Madam.

420
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:38,680
Second Brother,

421
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,079
did you sprain yourself?

422
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,119
Do it gently.

423
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:42,640
Second Brother.

424
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,160
Third Sister,

425
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,520
my leg can't make it.

426
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:48,640
Why doesn't

427
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,479
someone replace me?

428
00:25:51,199 --> 00:25:53,000
Who should replace you then?

429
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:56,199
Big Madam, look at my leg.

430
00:25:56,959 --> 00:25:59,599
Why don't I let my good friend?

431
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,160
Second Master of the Gu family,

432
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,160
help my younger sister?

433
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:04,319
Second Master Gu?

434
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,160
If he plays,

435
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,439
why will anyone bother to play then?

436
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:08,640
Just shove the hairpin

437
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,160
into Third Miss Yu's hand instead then.

438
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:13,119
This won't do.

439
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,920
I say, this...

440
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,319
Shitou, get a stool

441
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:23,520
for Second Young Master to sit.

442
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:33,959
Thank you.

443
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:34,920
Slower.

444
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:44,160
Let's do this. For the sake of fairness,

445
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,040
I will use my left hand to play.

446
00:26:46,719 --> 00:26:47,680
Third Younger Sister,

447
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,000
thank him now.

448
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:54,280
Second Brother Gu,

449
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,680
I know within the capital

450
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:56,359
everyone knows

451
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:57,880
you're the best at polo.

452
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:01,400
If you use your left hand to play,

453
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,239
will you be able to help us win?

454
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,640
I always win when I play.

455
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,599
It's not interesting at all.

456
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,479
I should play with my left hand to show fairness.

457
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,199
If Third Miss Yu

458
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,040
objects,

459
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,000
I won't go then.

460
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,800
Don't!

461
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,719
Third Sister, that girl from the Sheng family

462
00:27:19,719 --> 00:27:20,839
plays very well.

463
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:23,199
If Second Brother Gu

464
00:27:23,199 --> 00:27:24,040
can't win,

465
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:26,160
I think no one else can beat her.

466
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,119
It's in God's hand who wins,

467
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:29,400
but if you're not willing,

468
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,719
forget it!

469
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,719
Why is it so noisy over there?

470
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,520
Second Brother Gu, you are using

471
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,040
your left hand to hit the ball?

472
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,880
You're not trying to give us some points

473
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,040
since you're buddies

474
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,280
with my Second Brother, right?

475
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,280
This...

476
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,560
Sixth Sister, do you still want to play?

477
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,400
Play.

478
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,760
Are you dumb?

479
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:28,800
We can't win.

480
00:28:29,719 --> 00:28:30,439
I'm not playing.

481
00:28:31,439 --> 00:28:32,239
You haven't even played.

482
00:28:32,239 --> 00:28:33,199
How do you know that you can't win?

483
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,160
Look at how he hit the ball just now.

484
00:28:36,199 --> 00:28:37,400
If you want to be embarrassed, you do that alone.

485
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,199
I need to save some pride for Sheng House.

486
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:41,520
You didn't even try.

487
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,680
That's what's embarrassing!

488
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,800
Why do you fret, Young Master?

489
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,160
If Sixth Miss wins, that's good, of course.

490
00:28:50,719 --> 00:28:51,760
But if she loses,

491
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,079
we'll buy a pin

492
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:54,000
that's exactly the same

493
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,680
and she'll be grateful.

494
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,160
This is called,

495
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,599
"victory is hard, so be glad of defeat still."

496
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,880
Stop the nonsense.

497
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,719
Sixth Miss, you are alone.

498
00:29:02,719 --> 00:29:03,640
Still want to play?

499
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,640
Sixth Sister, stop playing

500
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,839
We won't be able to win.

501
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,439
That's a hairpin from your mother.

502
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,479
I want to get it back for you.

503
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:18,560
Even if I'm alone,

504
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,319
I want to play too.

505
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:22,959
I will play.

506
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,680
How can she play alone?

507
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,479
She'll surely lose then.

508
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,760
Mother,

509
00:29:32,959 --> 00:29:34,000
I will

510
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,760
play with her.

511
00:29:37,439 --> 00:29:38,439
Let me play with her instead.

512
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,400
Buwei,

513
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,599
get my sleeve band

514
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:42,319
and shoulder strap.

515
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,760
You you can't play.

516
00:29:50,439 --> 00:29:51,359
Why can't I play?

517
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,199
You you are an outsider male.

518
00:29:53,199 --> 00:29:53,839
How can you play?

519
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:55,160
Second Uncle Gu is also an outsider.

520
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,800
Third Miss Yu and I are different.

521
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:00,280
She's a doted legitimate daughter

522
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,359
and she has people backing her up

523
00:30:03,479 --> 00:30:05,040
I will back you up.

524
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,239
To me,

525
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,359
you are much higher than she is.

526
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:08,319
Stop saying that!

527
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:09,479
Do you want the gold pin or not?

528
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:13,239
Sixth Sister, let's not play anymore.

529
00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:14,079
I don't want the pin.

530
00:30:16,199 --> 00:30:16,959
I want it.

531
00:30:16,959 --> 00:30:17,760
If you want it, get on the horse.

532
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,479
What a dirty game.

533
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:35,719
Who cares if you think it's dirty.

534
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,640
Brother Yuanruo also went.

535
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,800
Look at someone divine

536
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,280
like Brother Yuanruo.

537
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,959
How could he go to the polo field?

538
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:49,520
You sure move quickly.

539
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:53,400
You found yourself a Sixth Young Master Liang.

540
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,119
So now you scoff at Brother Yuanruo.

541
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,800
I'm better than you.

542
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:00,359
You have been here a long time,

543
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,760
and you couldn't even say anything to him.

544
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,439
What's the use

545
00:31:04,439 --> 00:31:05,319
even if you talked to him?

546
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,280
Here.

547
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:23,400
Young Lord is playing.

548
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:26,000
Why so noisy?

549
00:31:27,199 --> 00:31:28,160
It's Duke Qi Manor's

550
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,000
Young Lord playing.

551
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,880
Who is the person

552
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,359
playing with Young Lord Qi?

553
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:01,119
Princess Jiacheng,

554
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,680
that's Jinying Alley's Minister Sheng's daughter,

555
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,719
Sheng Minglan.

556
00:32:35,199 --> 00:32:36,560
This young lady from the Sheng family.

557
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:38,760
"Clean and slippery, flying like a shooting star.

558
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,280
Moon-shaped mallets vie and whack without end."

559
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,520
It perfectly describes her.

560
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:45,640
This Sixth Daughter

561
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,000
usually doesn't talk much,

562
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,280
but she got Brother Yuanruo

563
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,319
to show up for her?

564
00:33:19,479 --> 00:33:20,719
It's great.

565
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,839
Didn't you say that

566
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:36,880
Minglan never talked much

567
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,839
with the Young Lord?

568
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,680
That's right.

569
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:41,479
Why is he helping her with the polo game then?

570
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,479
He just can't stand watching that Third Miss Yu.

571
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,920
That witch,

572
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,239
because her mother is pampered,

573
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,719
she pushed the eldest legitimate daughter out

574
00:33:49,719 --> 00:33:50,359
with no place to stand.

575
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:51,959
She was born to a mother

576
00:33:51,959 --> 00:33:53,160
who's the step-wife after marriage.

577
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:53,959
What justification does she have

578
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:55,119
to trample on the first wife's

579
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:56,079
legitimate eldest daughter?

580
00:33:56,479 --> 00:33:58,079
She needs a good lesson.

581
00:33:58,359 --> 00:33:59,880
Miss,

582
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,199
your rosewood hare brush.

583
00:34:02,239 --> 00:34:03,839
Sixth Miss has one too.

584
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,599
How can she have one too?

585
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,959
Aren't there only two?

586
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,080
One was given to Rulan,

587
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:09,879
and one to me.

588
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,879
Sixth Miss put it in an inconspicuous place

589
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,040
in the drawer.

590
00:34:14,479 --> 00:34:15,760
Mei'er saw it after

591
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,520
her second time in the room.

592
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,879
As soon as she saw it,

593
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:19,760
she was chased out

594
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,560
by Sister Danju.

595
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,560
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

596
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:25,879
I thought

597
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:27,520
you already had one.

598
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,439
Is that the same?

599
00:34:29,439 --> 00:34:31,159
That means Brother Yuanruo

600
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,520
gave her a total of three

601
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,000
while he gave me none!

602
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,239
Silly girl.

603
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,159
I'm asking you about the Young Lord.

604
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,760
I'm talking about him too.

605
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,120
As long as he doesn't talk to Molan

606
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,639
and she's angry, I will be happy.

607
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,639
Mother, look. Molan is so furious

608
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,600
that she threw her fan away!

609
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:55,159
Miss, Young Master Liang

610
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,600
is looking this way.

611
00:34:57,479 --> 00:35:00,199
Wicked girl. She's sneaking behind my back!

612
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,800
Mother.

613
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,080
Keep your eye on the ball.

614
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,320
Stop looking around wildly.

615
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,479
Yes.

616
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,840
She's pretending to smile at me now.

617
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:35,000
Look!

618
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:00,679
Only half an incense stick of time left.

619
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:02,040
Let them fight it.

620
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:04,080
That hairpin is just average

621
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,439
so why so competitive?

622
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,120
Expert Second Master,

623
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:29,399
you don't need to be so desperate.

624
00:36:29,399 --> 00:36:30,280
I don't have a choice.

625
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,040
Third Miss,

626
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,159
we're playing a civilized game.

627
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:34,959
What do you mean by this?

628
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,479
I can play however I like.

629
00:36:36,479 --> 00:36:37,520
Why do you care?

630
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,320
You mean,

631
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,399
we're playing a martial game?

632
00:36:39,479 --> 00:36:40,959
Yes, a martial match!

633
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:54,479
Young Lord, what are you doing?

634
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,760
He can do

635
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,719
whatever he likes.

636
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:57,600
Why do you care?

637
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,479
You!

638
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,080
If I had known earlier, I would have played!

639
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,520
The incense stick is extinguished.

640
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,000
Yellow team, seven points.

641
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,639
Yellow team wins!

642
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,120
Minglan.

643
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:11,360
Minglan.

644
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,120
This pin.

645
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,560
Though it's Miss Yu's item

646
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,840
in my heart

647
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,919
I only regard it as doing it for you.

648
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:22,199
I played

649
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:22,959
for you too.

650
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,239
Minglan.

651
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,040
Sixth Miss,

652
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,199
this match wasn't won easily.

653
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:30,919
Come.

654
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:41,679
Darling Second, you just lost like that?

655
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,199
You can't keep your champion title then.

656
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,439
How does that matter?

657
00:38:48,439 --> 00:38:49,280
Why should I preserve it?

658
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:53,439
The gold-silk pin.

659
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:57,280
Thank you, Madam Wu.

660
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,760
You won this.

661
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,719
Who does she think she is?

662
00:39:04,479 --> 00:39:05,120
Third Sister. Third Sister?

663
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,399
Third Sister, it doesn't matter.

664
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,280
Hey! Have a seat now, Third Sister.

665
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,360
Don't be mad.

666
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,600
It's just a pin!

667
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,000
We've got a jade bracelet.

668
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:25,840
Third Sister!

669
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,000
So amusing. Princess,

670
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,439
do you want to play polo?

671
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,159
The ball is not interesting.

672
00:39:40,439 --> 00:39:41,439
The person is interesting.

673
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,679
It was that Miss Sheng

674
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:46,840
who went to battle in the match,

675
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,080
but the award is to Miss Yu?

676
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,679
So did you lose

677
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:51,800
to the Miss Sheng

678
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,600
or Miss Yu?

679
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:55,600
Look at how desperate

680
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,439
Miss Sheng is.

681
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,159
And Miss Yu cried

682
00:39:58,159 --> 00:39:59,479
many bouts

683
00:39:59,479 --> 00:40:00,600
for this pin.

684
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,199
Those two are of one mind.

685
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,800
I merely wanted to make them happy.

686
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,239
To add further,

687
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:10,360
didn't you say

688
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,719
that Miss Yu is rarity?

689
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:15,280
Gentle and virtuous?

690
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:18,199
Yes.

691
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,919
Such a noble lady of

692
00:40:19,919 --> 00:40:21,080
gentle and virtuous nature.

693
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:22,719
You can't find

694
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:23,919
a second in the entire Bianjing City.

695
00:40:25,879 --> 00:40:27,120
She's such a good lady.

696
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,280
Shouldn't let her be sad.

697
00:40:49,879 --> 00:40:51,399
Grandmother taught you polo.

698
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:53,199
It was not to let you play with a man from outside.

699
00:40:57,919 --> 00:40:59,439
Third Brother ran away before the battle,

700
00:40:59,439 --> 00:41:00,560
and that's not what Grandmother taught us either.

701
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:05,120
The Yu family has always

702
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,399
gotten along well with Grandmother.

703
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,800
My brother isn't

704
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,320
as tyrannical as you

705
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:12,280
to insist on knocking Yu Family's pride.

706
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,879
Eldest Miss Yu was raised

707
00:41:15,879 --> 00:41:17,719
by the Imperial Tutor since young.

708
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:19,239
That's how they are close acquaintances

709
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:19,800
with our grandmother.

710
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:23,000
She agonized over her late mother's item,

711
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,520
and I felt empathy.

712
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,840
I think we are kindred souls in that way.

713
00:41:29,399 --> 00:41:30,679
It's really a coincidence then.

714
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,239
You pitied the Eldest Miss of the Yu family,

715
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,239
and Brother Yanruo pitied you too.

716
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,520
The Young Lord of Qi House

717
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,479
is man of upright disposition

718
00:41:42,479 --> 00:41:43,320
and loathes evil-doing.

719
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,919
He saw that Third Brother

720
00:41:45,919 --> 00:41:47,280
ditched me all alone,

721
00:41:47,479 --> 00:41:48,360
so he extended help

722
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,719
to me on Brother Changbai's account.

723
00:41:52,879 --> 00:41:53,560
Fourth Sister,

724
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,159
not only did you not help me talk to Third Brother,

725
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,719
you went and talked in depth

726
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:57,560
with Sixth Young Master Liang.

727
00:41:58,479 --> 00:41:58,919
This is also not

728
00:41:58,919 --> 00:41:59,959
how a Fourth Sister should be either.

729
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,919
You!

730
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:11,199
You're certain they will rest

731
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:12,239
and feed the horses at Yuqing Monastery?

732
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:13,760
I checked thoroughly.

733
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,479
It's definitely so.

734
00:42:14,959 --> 00:42:16,239
Big Madam and Sixth Miss' maids

735
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:17,080
were very tight-lipped.

736
00:42:17,479 --> 00:42:18,479
I thought I wouldn't

737
00:42:18,479 --> 00:42:19,520
be able to find out for you.

738
00:42:19,879 --> 00:42:21,439
But Miss Molan's maids

739
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,600
told me first

740
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,639
before I could even ask them.
