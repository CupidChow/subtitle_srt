1
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,842
Episode 72

3
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:05,520
Is she ill?

4
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,760
Yes,

5
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,320
she vomited blood on the street.

6
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,600
She must be so mad that

7
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,640
she was unbearably weak.

8
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,680
It is the first month after her giving a birth,

9
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,360
This isn't a sign of longevity.

10
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,240
I think that

11
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,200
the emperor

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,680
is really abandoning Gu Tingye as a pawn.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,440
Even the child was fetched

14
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,360
back from her maiden house.

15
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,320
She probably is afraid that she'll suddenly die,

16
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,200
in case she wants to see her child.

17
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:31,575
Watch Cheng Garden closely.

18
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,720
If there are any movements,

19
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,560
you immediately report it to me.

20
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,080
Yes.

21
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,440
At this moment, Second Brother and father

22
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,920
shouldn't attend the morning court anymore.

23
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,720
File for a leave of absence.

24
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,440
In view of your health condition,

25
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,440
stop worrying about these.

26
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,080
Especially Second Brother.

27
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,040
Stop thinking

28
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,920
about submitting complaint letter.

29
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,120
I finally understand now.

30
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,760
It's not really just the death of Madam Kang,

31
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,600
nor if our Gu's Big Madam

32
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,640
is an accomplice or not.

33
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,000
The emperor and Empress Dowager

34
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,360
don't really care about

35
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,560
the crime our Sheng Family committed.

36
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,000
Second Brother, do you understand?

37
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,120
He understands.

38
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,560
What about you?

39
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,920
Now, this matter is still a hot issue,

40
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,000
let's allow it to grow cold first.

41
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,640
Anyway, he'll get exiled after autumn.

42
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,400
We still have time.

43
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,360
Let's plan it again.

44
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,560
You are right.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,800
I repeatedly annoyed

46
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,280
the palace.

47
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,360
State Uncle and Sister Zhang said

48
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,800
that they would help me

49
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,680
convince Her Highness Empress again.

50
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,920
You used to plan

51
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,400
with conviction first before making any move.

52
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,600
This time, you got muddled because you cared too much.

53
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,560
Madam, Nanny Xiang is here.

54
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,880
Madam's maiden family are all here.

55
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,920
Grand Madam, hello.

56
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,040
Grand Madam has me here

57
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,640
to ask Madam to go there

58
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,000
for some discussion on important matters.

59
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,840
Our Cheng Garden

60
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,920
and your courtyard have nothing to discuss.

61
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,120
Miss Rong,

62
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,320
you can't say things

63
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:55,600
like that.

64
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,960
What's in line here is the future

65
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,440
of the marquis manor.

66
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,120
It's not yet been settled that who

67
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,360
can get the title Marquis of Ningyuan.

68
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,200
And Madam, your health is...

69
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,320
Our Grand Madam

70
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,000
is just afraid that what if

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,720
you get so ill and unable to get up from bed,

72
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,604
hence, she wants to have you there

73
00:04:11,665 --> 00:04:12,680
as soon as possible.

74
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,920
Bullying intolerably.

75
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,080
Leave!

76
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,676
Such imposing manner,

77
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:19,400
are you of high official status?

78
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,150
Leave!

79
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,160
Let me make it clearer then.

80
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,000
You people have taken away the nobility title,

81
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,240
burned our house,

82
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,200
and harmed my marquis husband.

83
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,520
My health now has also been dragged down.

84
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,680
Does your Big Madam

85
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,760
want me to die or something?!

86
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,280
Madam,

87
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,000
what are you saying?

88
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,200
These problems happening to your family

89
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,680
can't be blamed on my Grand Madam.

90
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,440
I'm urging you to

91
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,400
just quickly go there.

92
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,160
Now, you've lost your conferred title status.

93
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,400
If you don't go,

94
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,400
I fear that you might end up with

95
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,840
a crime of being unfilial and putting on airs.

96
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,040
This time,

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,280
no one will be defending you.

98
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,800
Xiaotao.

99
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,120
Let Shitou

100
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,120
and...

101
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,040
Liu Jingli

102
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,200
guard the Cheng Garden well.

103
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,760
Only close family members

104
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,080
are allowed to enter or exit.

105
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,720
Yes.

106
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,341
A dog is threatening

107
00:05:23,341 --> 00:05:24,680
because of the power of her master,

108
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,560
Leave!

109
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,760
Quickly leave!

110
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:31,800
You...

111
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,680
What kind of family is this?

112
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,400
You dirty woman!

113
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,225
Be good.

114
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:37,760
Leave!

115
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,760
Urgent news from the border!

116
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,800
Urgent news from the border!

117
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,160
Quickly open the city gate!

118
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,040
Never expected that

119
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,600
the war on our borders

120
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,200
would happen so quickly.

121
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,957
Their new leader has ascended

122
00:06:08,957 --> 00:06:10,200
the throne at a young age.

123
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,840
I hear that he's not even 17

124
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,160
and has a weak hold on his government.

125
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,538
He probably just wants to establish

126
00:06:16,538 --> 00:06:17,520
his imposing presence to stun his subjects,

127
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,393
and force our empire to open up

128
00:06:18,393 --> 00:06:20,120
the trading market.

129
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:22,840
That's right.

130
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,525
But Prime Minster and I

131
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
didn't expect it

132
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,760
to happen so quickly.

133
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,741
They actually broke through

134
00:06:32,741 --> 00:06:34,080
and conquered two cities now.

135
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,560
Royal Father,

136
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,120
I received a letter from Zhonghuai.

137
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,344
He said that he was reckless

138
00:06:42,344 --> 00:06:43,320
in his previous actions.

139
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,418
Now, he's willing to make up

140
00:06:44,418 --> 00:06:45,360
for his crimes and earn some merits,

141
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,480
leading an army on an expedition.

142
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,360
In Prime Minister Han's opinion,

143
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,000
if there are adequate food supplies

144
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,960
and the borders have enough winter clothes

145
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,720
for the coldness,

146
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,160
how early do you think

147
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,040
the army can set out?

148
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,725
Royal Father,

149
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,000
Zhonghuai is young and strong.

150
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,800
He has a chest full of desire to serve his country.

151
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,440
Need I listen to you now

152
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,280
in assigning a commander?

153
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,120
You are also young and strong,

154
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,920
and have a chest full of desires to serve your country.

155
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,800
Everyone is saying that you're very good,

156
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,560
That you are to inherit the throne in the future.

157
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,920
But currently, it's still my empire.

158
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,480
I feel that even if

159
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,120
the main army can't set out immediately,

160
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,885
there must be a reinforcement army

161
00:07:44,885 --> 00:07:46,040
going there now.

162
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,920
Or else, if the morale of the border army

163
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,680
becomes disorganized, we'll surely lose.

164
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,280
I'm willing to share your burden

165
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,680
and lead an army to go there.

166
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:04,880
I...

167
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,880
The border is in danger right now.

168
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,600
Your mother is a bit afraid.

169
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,640
You just stay in the palace

170
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,920
to comfort her.

171
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,000
Yes, Royal Father.

172
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,240
I currently don't have enough generals and soldiers.

173
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,520
I earnestly ask Your Majesty

174
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,360
to temporarily pardon Criminal Gu

175
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,960
and assign him to me as a vanguard.

176
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,800
Once the border has been pacified,

177
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,760
he will be escorted back to

178
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,600
be imprisoned and exiled.

179
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,280
Other than him,

180
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,920
don't I have other people around me now?

181
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,720
Although Criminal Gu is overbearing,

182
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,680
he's skilled in both literary and fighting,

183
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,680
and has outstanding intelligence in strategies.

184
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,879
He is also very familiar with

185
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,560
the topography of the border.

186
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,720
Shut up!

187
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,360
Criminal Gu is bearing a heavy crime.

188
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,920
He killed a wife of an official.

189
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,960
I'm already generous

190
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,200
with him for not executing him.

191
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,680
Just for private reasons,

192
00:08:52,825 --> 00:08:53,920
each of you

193
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,160
are disregarding state laws!

194
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,760
I'm not doing it for private reasons.

195
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,080
This is for our government!

196
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,120
Inform Your Majesty.

197
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,320
Your Majesty,

198
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,680
a state's military matters is of grave importance.

199
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,100
If it is beneficial to our borders,

200
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,960
our House of Wang

201
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,120
can temporarily not go after the crimes of Gu Tingye.

202
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,040
That's right.

203
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,200
You think...

204
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,800
So it means that

205
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,120
you all think that

206
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,600
I have no one to use,

207
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,520
and will just let that

208
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,960
Gu Tingye have a grasp on me?

209
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,200
Your Majesty!

210
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,800
I'm willing to use my official status as a guarantee!

211
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,280
Your Majesty,

212
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:42,968
I'm also willing

213
00:09:42,968 --> 00:09:44,240
o use my official status as a guarantee.

214
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,700
Soldiers! Soldiers!

215
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,760
Criminal Gu indeed committed a grave crime.

216
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,560
Although we need him to join our army,

217
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,880
it's not really to allow him

218
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,760
to wander around and be carefree.

219
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,369
I think we can just demote him to be

220
00:09:59,369 --> 00:10:00,720
an ordinary citizen without achievements,

221
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,951
and join the army as a foot soldier,

222
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:03,560
so as to make up for his crimes.

223
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,200
Your Majesty, the battlefield is a dangerous place.

224
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,520
Having an additional help

225
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,600
means having additional hope.

226
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,680
And many soldiers need not uselessly die because of it?

227
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,970
Okay. Okay.

228
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,620
Thank you, Your Majesty!

229
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,840
Thank you, Your Majesty! Thank you, Royal Father!

230
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,520
Old Geng,

231
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,160
if he escapes,

232
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,960
I'll have you answer for it!

233
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,360
Your father...he is over there.

234
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,760
Father!

235
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,840
He has left?

236
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,480
Yes.

237
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,440
You have something to say?

238
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,640
I don't understand,

239
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,880
why did Empress Dowager let the House of Wang

240
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,840
to especially facilitate his inclusion

241
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,880
in the army for the expedition?

242
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,960
It will only invite future troubles.

243
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,560
He was imprisoned by the emperor's side.

244
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,520
He has relatives and friends all over the capital.

245
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,880
It's not easy for Empress Dowager

246
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,800
to make any move.

247
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,680
But if anything bad happens

248
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,560
to him in the battlefield,

249
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,760
who else will say anything?

250
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,040
Then it means

251
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,080
that we just need

252
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,000
to wait for good news now?

253
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,920
This military disaster came at the right time.

254
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,520
It will end soon.

255
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,680
Big Madam Zhang is here.

256
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,800
One more drink.

257
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,160
Why is she still drinking medicine?

258
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,796
Madam suffered some trauma

259
00:13:35,796 --> 00:13:36,960
after her giving the birth.

260
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,720
It wasn't easy to finish her first month.

261
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,960
But she then fainted outside the palace.

262
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,640
How could she not suffer any damage?

263
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,640
Imperial Physician Zhang has checked me.

264
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,360
There's no big problem.

265
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,960
He just asked me to rest more.

266
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,680
I'm just a little tired.

267
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,120
Your Majesty,

268
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,760
our elite soldiers...have all perished.

269
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:13,240
The elite soldiers...have all...perished?

270
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,830
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

271
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,534
Imperial physician!

272
00:14:23,534 --> 00:14:25,560
Send for the imperial physician!

273
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,960
Call the imperial physician! Hurry!

274
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,280
Afterwards,

275
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,280
there's no more news about Gu Marquis.

276
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,100
My father said that he recklessly moved forward

277
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,775
because of rushing to gain merit and pursued

278
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:37,440
the enemies up to 50 miles from their city.

279
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,880
It's still not known if

280
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,800
he has fallen into a quicksand or an ambush.

281
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,680
Anyway, that team of his...

282
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,360
None of them was able to return.

283
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,960
I've hidden this from you for several days.

284
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,200
Now,

285
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,480
we also lost news from my father.

286
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,440
I'm afraid...

287
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,840
Sixth Little Sister...

288
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,080
Don't scare me,

289
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:04,800
Sixth Little Sister.

290
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,960
Breathe. Breathe, Sixth Little Sister.

291
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,720
The doctor! Call the doctor!

292
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,320
Yes.

293
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,600
Fill all these water urns.

294
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,640
Okay. Okay.

295
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,920
Tell them to set it up more densely

296
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,880
following the southern wall.

297
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:51,960
They must fill those parts in the back.

298
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:52,760
Okay. Yes.

299
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,120
Move faster!

300
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,000
Fill the urns!

301
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,720
Yes. Yes.

302
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,600
Put urns on the southern wall, too!

303
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01,440
Fill all the water urns.

304
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,520
Hurry.

305
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:07,000
Mother! Mother!

306
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,160
Mother...

307
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,320
I hear from people outside

308
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,160
that Second Brother...

309
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,560
Second Brother is gone.

310
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,640
The adjacent house is

311
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,760
already preparing funeral clothes.

312
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,520
The general situation will be decided soon.

313
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,160
Are you happy?

314
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,800
Mother,

315
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,000
with Second Brother getting in trouble,

316
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,480
was it you?

317
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,200
The House of Gu is all yours now.

318
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,440
All yours now!

319
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,400
No, I don't want a house like this!

320
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
If something bad happens to Second Brother,

321
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,200
I'll then submit a memorial,

322
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,640
asking Second Brother's child

323
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,800
to inherit the Marquis of Ningyuan title!

324
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,000
Hold that!

325
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,520
You...

326
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,720
Lower the palanquin.

327
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,480
Madam. Madam.

328
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,408
People from the palace are here to

329
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,800
promulgate an imperial edict.

330
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,040
Are they from the palace of Empress?

331
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,240
Doesn't look like it and they didn't ask that

332
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,240
the long altar with incense burner be placed.

333
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,480
Who came?

334
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,760
I don't know them. They all look unfamiliar.

335
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,560
Their leader claims to have a surname as Huang.

336
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,520
I don't remember any Eunuch Huang

337
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,920
in the palace of Empress.

338
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,320
Sorry for making you wait.

339
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,560
I wasn't feeling well these past days,

340
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,320
hence, wasn't able to get up as soon as possible.

341
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,480
Big Madam, no need to be courteous.

342
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,680
This matter is too sudden.

343
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,560
Her Highness Empress is rushing,

344
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,520
hence, no need to pay attention to

345
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,640
these etiquette anymore.

346
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,240
May Big Madam

347
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,000
quickly come to the palace with us.

348
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,000
Her Highness has important matters to tell you.

349
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,800
Okay.

350
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,600
We've already prepared a soft carriage for you outside.

351
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,760
Madam, let's quickly go.

352
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,520
Sir, your face is quite new to me.

353
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,760
There are a lot of servants in the palace.

354
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,760
It's understandable

355
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,680
if you haven't seen me before.

356
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,250
Yes. It's because I have

357
00:19:13,257 --> 00:19:14,080
limited knowledge and experience.

358
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,480
Empress will usually send Chief Eunuch Han

359
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,080
whenever she sends me imperial graces or messages.

360
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:21,960
After not seeing her for some time,

361
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,960
may I know if she's been doing well?

362
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,840
Empress has two chief eunuchs by her side.

363
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,280
One has a surname as Ma, the other Wu.

364
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,480
Was there anyone with a surname as Han?

365
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,880
Are you trying to test our words?

366
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,400
Can you even fake people

367
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,360
from the palace?

368
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:43,880
If you don't believe us,

369
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,280
let your needlework old maidservants here

370
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,640
and check then.

371
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,720
See if our clothes

372
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,240
and accessories

373
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,800
are from the palace or not.

374
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,600
No need for that.

375
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,640
You all are indeed

376
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,680
from the palace.

377
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,040
I just fear that

378
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,920
you're not really working for the Empress.

379
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,640
In the palace of Empress,

380
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,840
the main chief eunuchs

381
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,920
are indeed Wu and Ma.

382
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,400
But both are now old.

383
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,840
His Majesty then assigned a Steward Han

384
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,680
to replace them.

385
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,960
Since a year ago,

386
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,600
the palace maids and lower ranked eunuchs

387
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,440
have long started calling him

388
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,520
Chief Eunuch Han.

389
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,160
If you really work for Empress,

390
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,280
how can't you know this?

391
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,320
Since you know,

392
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,118
why aren't you respectfully

393
00:20:40,118 --> 00:20:41,280
addressing him as Chief Eunuch?

394
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,240
Unless

395
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,960
you're not really working in her palace.

396
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,669
An imperial edict was issued,

397
00:20:50,669 --> 00:20:51,720
asking you to enter the palace.

398
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,760
You dare not go?

399
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,680
I'm not going!

400
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,280
You...

401
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,680
Are you rebelling? You're rebelling!

402
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,040
I'll go back to the palace and report that

403
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,440
your House of Gu wants to rebel!

404
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,200
You...

405
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,800
Don't move!

406
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,360
You dare arrest people from the palace?!

407
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,240
You...

408
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,080
We are here with a verbal decree!

409
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,760
Quickly let me go!

410
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,610
You'd better behave well!

411
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,000
Or else, I'll have your whole clan annihilated!

412
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,440
Immediately send people

413
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,880
to deliver messages to the different high officials.

414
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,680
Someone's trying

415
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,760
to fake imperial edicts to abduct officials

416
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,150
and their families into the palace

417
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:30,600
and threaten the government with them.

418
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,840
Tell everyone not to believe it!

419
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,200
Yes!

420
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:33,760
Yes, Madam.

421
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,320
Drag them away!

422
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,600
Move! Move!

423
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,280
Take them away!

424
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:38,840
I can walk!

425
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,480
Move!

426
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:53,840
It's zi time now .

427
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,520
Big Madam,

428
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,480
something seems to be happening outside.

429
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,640
Instruct the kitchen

430
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,960
to put oil in pans

431
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,800
and heat them.

432
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,680
Send people by the courtyard's wall

433
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,640
and put a block of stone every 20 steps.

434
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,840
And then put the heated oil

435
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,560
by the wall.

436
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,840
Leave two people with every pile of stone.

437
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,920
Yes.

438
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,040
Take care.

439
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,720
Hurry! Hurry! Go! Go!

440
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,560
Inform everyone

441
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,120
to strictly guard the corner doors.

442
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,840
Watch the walls on the backyard,

443
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,463
and don't let anyone enter by

444
00:24:10,463 --> 00:24:11,000
climb over them amidst the chaos.

445
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,120
Yes. Yes.

446
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,480
They are killing people...

447
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,680
Father! Father!

448
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,720
It's dangerous to stay outside!

449
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,520
They are killing people!

450
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,760
Father. Hurry.

451
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,400
Close the doors!

452
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,160
Quickly close the doors!

453
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,560
They're killing people.

454
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,960
Take all the children

455
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,560
to Weiruixuan to hide!

456
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,880
Right. Right.

457
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,640
Guard the main gate well.

458
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,400
Hong'er!

459
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,800
Mother, why did you come here?

460
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,500
This...is this a mutiny?

461
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,427
His Majesty is critically ill, and there's an

462
00:24:35,427 --> 00:24:35,960
urgent situation now in the borders.

463
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,000
Someone then made use of the chaos to revolt.

464
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,880
They've started killing people out in the streets.

465
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,400
Did you hear me?!

466
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,120
Ming'er!

467
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,440
What about my Minglan?

468
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,600
Changbai, what about Ming'er?

469
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,520
Ming'er.

470
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,080
Where's Ming'er?

471
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,240
Grandmother, don't worry.

472
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,520
Zhonghuai left his men

473
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,560
in Cheng Garden.

474
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,480
All have been in the battlefield.

475
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,400
Their security is better than ours.

476
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,440
What about our house?

477
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,720
Those evil people won't come in our house, right?

478
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,600
As long as we tightly guard our doors

479
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,320
and not recklessly let people in,

480
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,080
we will be safe.

481
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,360
Guard the main door well!

482
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,680
It's better that

483
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,280
we go back to our room and hide.

484
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:17,960
Any part of the courtyard

485
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,280
that's not lighted,

486
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,080
you all light a torch there.

487
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,280
Don't let any of the evil person come in.

488
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,040
Open the stock room in front of the stable.

489
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,560
All of you who are young and strong,

490
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,000
go get a torch.

491
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,280
If anyone dares to break through our doors,

492
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,360
kill them!

493
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,320
Yes!

494
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,200
The imperial edict is here!

495
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,440
People from the Gu Manor, aren't you going to hurry

496
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,400
and come out to receive the decree?

497
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,280
Nonsense!

498
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,160
It has always been palace eunuchs

499
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,200
who promulgate decrees.

500
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,101
Just listening to you and I know that

501
00:26:38,101 --> 00:26:39,120
you're not from the palace.

502
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,760
You must be a liar.

503
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:40,880
Quickly leave!

504
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,368
His Majesty has given orders

505
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,760
that since evildoers are revolting,

506
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,480
the situation has become urgent!

507
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,320
We were especially ordered to go house to house

508
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,560
and escort noble families to the palace to hide.

509
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,640
Hence, we didn't bring any palace eunuchs with us.

510
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,960
My house has high and sturdy walls.

511
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,840
We're not afraid of evildoers!

512
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,480
Thank you for his Majesty's good intentions,

513
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,240
but we won't go anymore!

514
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,520
Gu,

515
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,400
you'd better just listen to my words!

516
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,800
What if the rebels enter your house?

517
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,440
You will die.

518
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,560
My madam already said

519
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,010
that life or death is all fated.

520
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,120
She will not bear any grudges.

521
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,440
We swear to survive or die with House of Gu!

522
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,400
You dare disobey an imperial decree?

523
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,280
Not knowing to appreciate a goodwill.

524
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,480
Break open their door!

525
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,400
Yes!

526
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,600
Charge!

527
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,680
Release the arrows!

528
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,920
Close the door!

529
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,480
Leave someone alive!

530
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,040
Nanny, I'm afraid.

531
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,880
Rong'er, don't be afraid.

532
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,560
Your father is a great commander

533
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,080
that is peerless in bravery.

534
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,680
You are the daughter of a general.

535
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,440
You should be like them, unafraid of anything.

536
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,520
I'm afraid of fire.

537
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,640
We have people guarding

538
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,960
all the courtyards and walls.

539
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,480
No one can enter.

540
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,120
Just carry your little brother and amuse him.

541
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,880
Okay.

542
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,760
Greetings, Your Highness.

543
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,400
Brother-in-law, you work so fast.

544
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,320
In just a tea time,

545
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,600
you've already occupied the imperial city.

546
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,720
It's just that the people sent out

547
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,560
to fetch those officials and their families

548
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,880
still haven't returned.

549
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,640
I fear that we still haven't won yet.

550
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:32,960
Before that happens,

551
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,760
It's just a matter time.

552
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,760
Anyway, the palace is now under our control.

553
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,520
My husband

554
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,320
won't be able to escape now.

555
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,400
That's true indeed.

556
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,120
What next?

557
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,200
Is there any movement inside?

558
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,440
Nothing's happening inside

559
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,120
I've knocked a few times, but no one's answering.

560
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,160
Should we just break the door?

561
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,200
Just give your order,

562
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,080
and I will let them break it open.

563
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:49,880
Wait.

564
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,640
Go and invite Empress Dowager to come here.

565
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:53,700
Yes.

566
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,335
We must have the verbal decree

567
00:29:56,335 --> 00:29:57,120
of Empress Dowager,

568
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,600
so we can justify our actions.

569
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,080
Yes.

570
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,880
Come! Surround it!

571
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,200
Yes!

572
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,760
Big Madam!

573
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,080
Big Madam,

574
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,280
Tu Second sent a message to say

575
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,680
that Nanny Xiang opened the inner gates

576
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,600
and guided a group of assassins to enter.

577
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,200
They've all been captured.

578
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,440
They've been interrogated

579
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,080
and confessed that with them,

580
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,560
there's still one person dressed as a maidservant

581
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,240
in our manor

582
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,760
and was wearing a veiled hat,

583
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,480
who was following by Nanny Xiang's side earlier.

584
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:23,720
Wearing a veiled hat?

585
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:24,600
Yes.

586
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,720
It means that

587
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,600
people in our courtyard knows her.

588
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,640
Where did that person

589
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,520
disappear?

590
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:32,875
At the second gate.

591
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:33,880
She wasn't seen

592
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,720
at the Mingzhen Corridor anymore.

593
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,560
Oh, no!

594
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,760
You bitches that want to die!

595
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,800
You dare do a sneaky move on me?!

596
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,680
Shitou and Xiaotao come with me.

597
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,120
You stay behind and help Jingli

598
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:42,440
Yes.

599
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,760
I'll tear your little house down!

600
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,000
I'll capture you alive, then rape you

601
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,200
before killing you!

602
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,720
Storm the gate!

603
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,160
Could the evil people in front be coming?

604
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,400
What's going on?

605
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,720
It's you?

606
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,960
Get lost!

607
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,440
Mother?

608
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,160
You ungrateful little bastard.

609
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,480
You dare to hit me?!

610
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,800
Why are you defending that little scoundrel?

611
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,200
I'm going to kill him

612
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,120
and seek vengeance for your brother!

613
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,760
Mother!

614
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:13,920
Little brother...

615
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,040
Little brother...

616
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,000
Little Brother...

617
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,480
Mother!

618
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,560
Mother!

619
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,520
Mother!

620
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,160
Mother...

621
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,400
My mother is dead!

622
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,320
I don't have a mother anymore!

623
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,320
She's dead.

624
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,440
I don't have a mother anymore!

625
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,160
They're using cloud ladders to storm their way in.

626
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,120
The main gate will be lost soon.

627
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,560
Cloud ladders?

628
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,000
No wonder they started fires first.

629
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,200
So they were stealing the cloud ladders.

630
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,200
With it,

631
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,360
any high defense can be conquered.

632
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:46,720
Shitou, quickly take the children and escape first.

633
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,920
Okay.

634
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:48,800
No!

635
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,960
If you take two children,

636
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,960
it will easily attract attention.

637
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,680
Put out all the fire

638
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,480
and let's all go to the secret chamber.

639
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,960
Okay. Let's go.

640
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,800
Nanny, let's go.

641
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,880
Hurry! Hurry! Go up!

642
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,480
Hurry up! Hurry and go up!

643
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,440
Hurry!

644
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:16,920
Shoot!

645
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,520
Shoot!

646
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,880
Quickly go up!

647
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,800
Hurry and get up!

648
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,400
Rise!

649
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:30,920
Charge!

650
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,320
Your Majesty,

651
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,240
be careful of getting cold.

652
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,440
Your Majesty!

653
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:25,960
How are the things?

654
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,160
Your Majesty,

655
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,560
Funing Palace Hall has been surrounded.

656
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,240
How many are they?

657
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,280
It's dark, so I can't see it clearly.

658
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,720
Around more than a hundred.

659
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,800
All are wearing Jin Imperial Army uniforms.

660
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,360
We wanted to go out,

661
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,200
but we got pushed back.

662
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,440
The leader said

663
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,560
that no one was allowed to leave.

664
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,240
With just those Jin Imperial Army in the palace,

665
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,640
it's impossible that

666
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,040
they could have surrounded Funing Palace Hall.

667
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,120
Your Majesty,

668
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,760
the whole capital is in chaos.

669
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,560
They seemed to

670
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,440
have attacked using cloud ladders.

671
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,920
How can there be cloud ladders

672
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,560
in the palace?

673
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,080
It's from the Fire Rescue Team.

674
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,720
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

675
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,040
Royal Father, Royal Mother, don't be afraid.

676
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,280
I'm here.

677
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,480
Help! Someone is killing people!

678
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,840
Move! Move!

679
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,320
Enter the city!

680
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,800
Save the emperor!

681
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,600
Enter the city!

682
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,240
Save the emperor!

683
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,040
Shitou, move these away.

684
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:15,880
Okay.

685
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:38,760
How come

686
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,960
there's still such a place?

687
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,720
Don't talk anymore. Quickly go in.

688
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,320
Shitou,

689
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,440
stay inside and protect them well.

690
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,560
Come. Okay, Madam.

691
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,320
Nanny, be careful.

692
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:51,800
Slowly.

693
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,520
Shitou.

694
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,880
Give me Tuan'er.

695
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,080
There are food and water inside.

696
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:02,880
If I don't come to look for you,

697
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,720
don't come out.

698
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,480
Okay.

699
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,040
Come.

700
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,560
I will stay with you until death.

701
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,640
If you don't let me go with you,

702
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,960
I'll tell people about this place.

703
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,440
Okay.

704
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,200
Mother!

705
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,520
Mother!

706
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,120
What did you call me?

707
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,400
It's full of soldiers and very chaotic outside.

708
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,400
Our whole family must stay together!

709
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,520
Mother!

710
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:37,960
Rong'er, don't be afraid.

711
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,480
I surely

712
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,360
will protect you well.

713
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,400
Mother...

714
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,680
Don't be afraid.

715
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,200
Mother.

716
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,040
No!

717
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,320
Come, listen to your mother. Rong'er!

718
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,840
I want to be with mother!

719
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,840
Rong'er, listen to your mother.

720
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,600
Come.

721
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,760
Come, listen to your mother's words.

722
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,840
We will be meeting the leopards and wolves soon.

723
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,080
Are you afraid?

724
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:24,920
I am.

725
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,000
Let's go.

726
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,240
Let's go.

727
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,280
You bunch of treacherous

728
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,680
and wild people, without an emperor in your eyes!

729
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,680
You dare use the name of

730
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,160
Her Highness Empress and Empress Dowager

731
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,360
to deceive the prime minister!

732
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,160
What punishment must...

733
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,520
How dare you!

734
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,040
Shut up!

735
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,200
Her Highness has issued a decree that

736
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,000
if there are people

737
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,825
who persistently refusing to

738
00:40:54,825 --> 00:40:55,720
enter the palace for hiding,

739
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,200
they will be killed without leniency!

740
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,800
How dare you!

741
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,668
You dare to kill a current high official

742
00:40:59,668 --> 00:41:01,480
of the government out in the street?!

743
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,680
What punishment must you be dealt with?!

744
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,320
Ma Hui! Ma Hui!

745
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,600
Come out here!

746
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,160
Ma Hui! Execute him!

747
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,480
Father!

748
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,400
Commander Gu!

749
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,360
Commander Gu, you're not dead!

750
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,560
You didn't die.

751
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,600
Commander Gu!

752
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,880
Commander Gu is back! Commander Gu is back!

753
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:30,720
Commander Gu!

754
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,560
Prime Minister, rest for a while!

755
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,240
I still have to handle some affairs in front!

756
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,160
Have to take my leave first!

757
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,440
Commander Gu!

758
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,440
Commander Gu is alive!

759
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,800
Commander Gu! Commander Gu!

760
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,280
Commander Gu, you're still alive! Commander Gu!

761
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,280
Commander Gu!

762
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:48,680
Commander Gu!

763
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,440
Gu Marquis! Gu Marquis!

764
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,360
What really is going on here?!

765
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,040
What's going on?!
