00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,893
Episode 25

3
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:13,125
Mother! Mother!

4
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:14,250
No, what are you doing? Don't be rash!

5
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,050
Calm down!

6
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:15,825
Don't touch me! You...

7
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:18,525
I'm a Xiucai! I'm a Xiucai!

8
00:01:19,325 --> 00:01:20,525
Stop! Stop!

9
00:01:20,525 --> 00:01:21,475
You dare push me?

10
00:01:21,475 --> 00:01:23,175
You...dare push me!

11
00:01:23,175 --> 00:01:25,850
You dare to act in such an uncultured manner?

12
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:26,425
Stop it already!

13
00:01:26,425 --> 00:01:27,325
If you're done causing a ruckus!

14
00:01:27,325 --> 00:01:28,150
Unruly! Get out!

15
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,375
You're acting in such an uncultured manner!

16
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,600
You're so unrefined!

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,175
Sit. Sit.

18
00:01:41,275 --> 00:01:42,150
At present,

19
00:01:43,675 --> 00:01:45,325
as the eldest house,

20
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,450
we were not able to handle our family matter well,

21
00:01:50,825 --> 00:01:52,175
and had to trouble you all to come here.

22
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:08,800
Sister Pinlan!

23
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,675
Give that to me.

24
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:18,450
Sit. Sit.

25
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:24,075
It's a registration deed.

26
00:02:41,675 --> 00:02:42,975
Not allowing any prostitute to enter our family

27
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:45,325
is an ancestral teaching of our clan.

28
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,275
It's not being unreasonable

29
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:47,925
and overbearing.

30
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,825
Your Sun Clan has to consider having descendants,

31
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:55,488
while our Sheng Family's daughter Shulan

32
00:02:55,488 --> 00:02:56,350
must practice filial piety.

33
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,425
My son said it right.

34
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,275
Xiucai Sun,

35
00:03:01,925 --> 00:03:03,300
despite having some prestige,

36
00:03:04,575 --> 00:03:06,425
you frequented places of pleasure,

37
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:08,856
wanting to take in a prostitute as a concubine

38
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,175
tainting your cultured reputation.

39
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,625
You did so well.

40
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,475
Fellow prominent and worthy elders,

41
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,500
please look at this registration deed.

42
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,400
Everyone, please look.

43
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:29,725
This...

44
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,775
Isn't this a census registration deed

45
00:03:32,775 --> 00:03:33,617
in the possession of the Madam

46
00:03:33,617 --> 00:03:34,525
in charge of the Qianjin Brothel?

47
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:35,825
Correct.

48
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,225
Sun Zhigao, you beast.

49
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,152
You used my daughter's dowry

50
00:03:44,152 --> 00:03:45,325
to fund your brothel visits

51
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,550
and to buy a prostitute's freedom.

52
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,825
You didn't even know to spend more

53
00:03:50,825 --> 00:03:52,825
to end her prostitute registration deed!

54
00:03:56,675 --> 00:03:57,875
Sun Zhigao,

55
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:02,400
your low-status prostitute is forcing the divorce

56
00:04:03,825 --> 00:04:05,100
of a woman from a decent family.

57
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:05,789
Just adding a complaint letter

58
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:06,425
on top of this census registration deed,

59
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:07,450
and then submitting it

60
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,250
to the Academician in Bianjing,

61
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,450
you think he will preserve your scholarly status?

62
00:04:11,575 --> 00:04:12,625
Brother Gao,

63
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,700
you were able to achieve merit at a young age.

64
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,625
At age twelve, you passed the Xiucai examination.

65
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,125
That was originally an honor,

66
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:18,796
a person who was able to

67
00:04:18,796 --> 00:04:19,575
give the Sun clan prestige.

68
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:22,100
Never thought that you've become like this.

69
00:04:22,725 --> 00:04:24,325
I urge you to amicably discuss this matter

70
00:04:24,325 --> 00:04:26,550
with the House of Sheng first.

71
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:30,050
Clan Elder, your surname is Sun!

72
00:04:32,475 --> 00:04:33,975
I understand the hardship of your House of Sun.

73
00:04:33,975 --> 00:04:34,925
It wasn't easy

74
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:37,825
to finally have a descendant.

75
00:04:38,725 --> 00:04:40,175
How could you easily let go?

76
00:04:41,175 --> 00:04:42,100
Moreover,

77
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,050
Zhigao has feelings

78
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,725
for that woman.

79
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:48,875
But

80
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,450
the children of our House of Sheng

81
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,350
will never lower themselves

82
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,400
to be sisters with prostitutes.

83
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,350
Let's just do this.

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,400
We'll give half of her dowry to your family.

85
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,400
The two families will amicably separate.

86
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,225
That's already a good closure

87
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:09,875
for these three years of marriage.

88
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,175
It's still Old Madam

89
00:05:14,175 --> 00:05:15,750
who is highly-principled.

90
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,575
That would be for the best.

91
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,800
We shouldn't destroy the good relationship

92
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,900
of the two families.

93
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,025
Our family has already yielded

94
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,525
to this level.

95
00:05:28,025 --> 00:05:29,275
If your family still refuses,

96
00:05:30,575 --> 00:05:33,350
I'll then sue you to the Academician

97
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,950
with this prostitute registration deed.

98
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,150
Let the whole county see

99
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,675
the dignity of your Xiucai!

100
00:05:44,825 --> 00:05:46,775
Half is already more than one thousand yuan.

101
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,350
For these past days,

102
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,550
I've been cooking and washing clothes.

103
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,025
My back will be breaking soon.

104
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,625
That person at home

105
00:05:57,675 --> 00:05:59,350
also keeps asking for bird's nest.

106
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,850
Buying a slave will also require money.

107
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,625
Okay already, Mother. I know.

108
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,350
We need money for everything.

109
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:12,550
An amicable separation then.

110
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:15,700
We've already prepared

111
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,375
the document.

112
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,300
May I ask Master Secretary

113
00:06:21,025 --> 00:06:23,100
to be our witness.

114
00:06:26,925 --> 00:06:27,900
Wait!

115
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,050
Where's the dowry?

116
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,575
The list of dowry?

117
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:33,400
The list of dowry is here.

118
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,625
So uncultured.

119
00:07:31,975 --> 00:07:32,558
May the side of the wife

120
00:07:32,558 --> 00:07:33,525
come to the front to sign the document.

121
00:07:34,775 --> 00:07:35,275
I'll do it.

122
00:07:35,275 --> 00:07:35,950
Mother,

123
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,175
I'll do it myself.

124
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:58,725
Shulan!

125
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,272
You are not talented nor beautiful,

126
00:08:03,272 --> 00:08:04,375
dull and uninteresting.

127
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,450
You originally shouldn't have been paired with me.

128
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,175
When you're paired with a butcher

129
00:08:08,175 --> 00:08:08,950
or a farmer in the future,

130
00:08:10,975 --> 00:08:12,725
remember to be more virtuous.

131
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,950
You're a womanizer, unfaithful,

132
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,400
and immoral scum!

133
00:08:36,575 --> 00:08:39,550
I feel disgusted just by giving you one more look!

134
00:08:39,725 --> 00:08:40,625
You...

135
00:08:41,025 --> 00:08:42,625
You see...

136
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:13,200
So uncultured.

137
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,025
So unrefined. Don't get mad.

138
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,150
Now, you've become daring enough to talk.

139
00:09:20,975 --> 00:09:22,525
More daring to take responsibility.

140
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:24,950
Those brothers of yours

141
00:09:25,075 --> 00:09:26,375
are not as bold as you.

142
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,025
I indeed was a bit too presumptuous.

143
00:09:32,775 --> 00:09:34,025
But we're finally able to get

144
00:09:34,025 --> 00:09:35,175
that amicable separation document.

145
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,500
Sister Shulan

146
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,925
was able to escape that hell.

147
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,250
Moreover,

148
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,575
I was wearing a long-veiled hat,

149
00:09:41,575 --> 00:09:42,750
so that my whole body was covered.

150
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,500
Nobody saw me.

151
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:46,798
The other party also might

152
00:09:46,798 --> 00:09:47,775
not be able to recognize me.

153
00:09:47,975 --> 00:09:48,825
You wish.

154
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,500
That deed is being held by the Sheng Family.

155
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,575
Of course they'll be able to guess that

156
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,300
it was done by daughters of the Sheng family!

157
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,100
Brother He

158
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,225
promised to give treatment

159
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:01,600
to that Madam in charge.

160
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,750
If she wants her headache to abate

161
00:10:04,975 --> 00:10:06,200
and be able to sleep soundly at night,

162
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,100
she surely won't say a word.

163
00:10:09,225 --> 00:10:10,450
That Brother He

164
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,625
is quite obedient with you.

165
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,525
He's a good man.

166
00:10:17,925 --> 00:10:19,025
In coming back this time,

167
00:10:20,675 --> 00:10:22,100
you encountered this matter of Shu'er.

168
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,724
You can say that you've experienced

169
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:25,500
the ways of the world.

170
00:10:31,075 --> 00:10:31,937
Eldest Grandmother calculated

171
00:10:31,937 --> 00:10:33,000
and planned everything so thoroughly.

172
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,175
Eldest Uncle, Eldest Auntie,

173
00:10:35,175 --> 00:10:36,425
and Brother Changwu

174
00:10:37,075 --> 00:10:38,200
also followed the plan

175
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,475
step by step.

176
00:10:40,275 --> 00:10:42,175
Some people are quite ferocious.

177
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,950
Some are pretentiously gentle.

178
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,200
Being flexible and sacrificing some wealth

179
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,825
can avoid disaster.

180
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,975
Plus that fact that I'm quick-witted,

181
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,350
so this matter ended perfectly.

182
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:52,521
It's also thanks to the fact

183
00:10:52,521 --> 00:10:53,225
that the House of Sun is stupid.

184
00:10:53,975 --> 00:10:55,425
They didn't even know to get the registration deed.

185
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:57,975
Hence, our family was able to handle this matter.

186
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,500
We just needed to remove a layer of skin,

187
00:11:00,775 --> 00:11:01,600
and were still able to turn back.

188
00:11:02,675 --> 00:11:04,075
If your Sister Shulan

189
00:11:04,075 --> 00:11:05,950
married into a noble and prestigious family

190
00:11:06,325 --> 00:11:07,875
and encountered such a matter,

191
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:09,925
turning back

192
00:11:09,925 --> 00:11:12,650
is an impossibility,

193
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:13,753
even if you pray to the gods

194
00:11:13,753 --> 00:11:14,725
of the heavens and earth.

195
00:11:14,725 --> 00:11:16,125
She could only

196
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,125
be tormented alive.

197
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,825
I understand what you mean.

198
00:11:24,825 --> 00:11:26,150
Brother He

199
00:11:27,175 --> 00:11:29,175
is very submissive to you.

200
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,825
Living the rest of your days with him

201
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:34,850
would surely be relaxing.

202
00:11:38,425 --> 00:11:39,250
Grandmother,

203
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,625
I still feel that Sister Shulan was aggrieved.

204
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,825
Sister Shulan married into a lower-status family.

205
00:11:46,825 --> 00:11:48,925
It should have been a smooth-sailing life.

206
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:51,800
The lives of that Sun family

207
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,750
all depended on

208
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,700
her dowry.

209
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,125
They should have treated her

210
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:57,650
in a courteous manner.

211
00:11:58,650 --> 00:11:59,675
But that Sun family

212
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:01,150
instead felt that

213
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,350
the more they ordered Sister Shulan around,

214
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,725
the more it showed how they are

215
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:06,325
not affected by wealth.

216
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,575
Trying to be lofty.

217
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,330
This is called

218
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,200
"eating soft rice with conviction".

219
00:12:17,525 --> 00:12:19,225
"Eating soft rice with conviction"?

220
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,125
You can even come up with a phrase like that?

221
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,150
You said it right.

222
00:12:27,025 --> 00:12:28,650
Your Sister Shulan was too soft and weak.

223
00:12:30,525 --> 00:12:31,900
She totally didn't know

224
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,625
to argue with them.

225
00:12:34,425 --> 00:12:35,850
She was afraid to hurt

226
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,500
that shaky pride of her husband.

227
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,575
Just to earn his good side,

228
00:12:39,575 --> 00:12:41,800
she lowered herself

229
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,225
and kept enduring.

230
00:12:44,275 --> 00:12:45,825
Your eldest uncle and eldest auntie

231
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:46,900
love their daughter dearly

232
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,375
and were afraid that she'd suffer,

233
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,100
so they would send over a lot of money

234
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,750
every time the two of them fought.

235
00:12:53,425 --> 00:12:55,400
They wanted to use money to buy peace.

236
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,360
But encountering a mother and son

237
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,325
like those from the Sun family

238
00:12:59,175 --> 00:12:59,589
who are good in

239
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:00,675
taking advantage of people's weakness,

240
00:13:01,275 --> 00:13:02,800
they totally didn't give any importance

241
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,050
to your Sister Shulan.

242
00:13:06,525 --> 00:13:07,550
I told you about

243
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,575
these internal family matters

244
00:13:10,325 --> 00:13:11,625
so as to prepare you for the inevitable.

245
00:13:13,525 --> 00:13:14,725
In my heart,

246
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:17,475
I still want to choose a family

247
00:13:17,475 --> 00:13:18,875
with simple member relationships,

248
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,250
a benevolent mother-in-law,

249
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,750
and a sincere husband.

250
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,575
Hope that your days won't be so tumultuous.

251
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,525
That you'll be able to

252
00:13:30,975 --> 00:13:32,650
see the end at one glance.

253
00:13:34,225 --> 00:13:35,425
But Grandmother,

254
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,231
not everything in this world

255
00:13:37,231 --> 00:13:38,550
can go the way you want it to.

256
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,575
For example, the House of Sun.

257
00:13:44,475 --> 00:13:45,619
A widow who washes clothes for a living with a son

258
00:13:45,619 --> 00:13:46,575
who passed the county civil examination?

259
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,600
In the heart of Eldest Auntie,

260
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,125
they were a good household.

261
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,025
Who knew that

262
00:13:52,025 --> 00:13:53,750
Sister Shulan

263
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,175
would end up this way?

264
00:13:56,825 --> 00:13:57,491
It shows that whether

265
00:13:57,491 --> 00:13:58,650
it's a noble and prestigious family,

266
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,700
or a small household,

267
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,050
all must be managed dutifully

268
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,925
in a very careful manner.

269
00:14:07,025 --> 00:14:09,100
Only then can it be harmonious in the end.

270
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,400
You said it well.

271
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,625
I'm thinking

272
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,325
Old Madam, Miss,

273
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,100
Eldest Old Madam isn't doing well.

274
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,525
Let's go and have a look.

275
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:38,575
Mother.

276
00:14:42,325 --> 00:14:43,200
Mother.

277
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,400
Who is Mother looking for?

278
00:14:46,525 --> 00:14:47,325
We're all here.

279
00:14:50,675 --> 00:14:51,850
Shu'er...

280
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,775
My Shu'er...

281
00:14:54,775 --> 00:14:55,750
Grandmother.

282
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,150
My Shu'er...

283
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,450
Who is Grandmother looking for?

284
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,700
It's that aunt of yours

285
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,675
who died at a very young age.

286
00:15:04,525 --> 00:15:05,725
Her name was Sheng Shu.

287
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,775
I just hugged you like that.

288
00:15:11,475 --> 00:15:15,550
I saw how you swallowed your last breath.

289
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:25,525
Sheng...Sheng Huaizhong...

290
00:15:27,325 --> 00:15:29,050
You...you...

291
00:15:31,025 --> 00:15:33,116
You favored your concubine

292
00:15:33,116 --> 00:15:35,275
and ignored your main wife.

293
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,350
Getting confused by beauty.

294
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,825
Mistreating the lives of others.

295
00:15:45,075 --> 00:15:48,550
I'll go to the God of Hell and sue you!

296
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:50,925
Mother.

297
00:15:51,175 --> 00:15:53,450
Shu'er...Shu'er...

298
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:54,450
Grandmother.

299
00:15:54,775 --> 00:15:56,150
Grandmother!

300
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,000
I'll...seek...

301
00:16:01,675 --> 00:16:05,200
seek... ven...vengeance!

302
00:16:09,475 --> 00:16:10,575
Mother. Mother.

303
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:14,250
Grandmother! Grandmother!

304
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,175
Grandmother!

305
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,775
Mother!

306
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,925
Grandmother!

307
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:57,598
You wrote in your letter last time that

308
00:16:57,598 --> 00:16:58,650
Uncle was looking for Doctor Zhang.

309
00:16:59,475 --> 00:17:01,275
May I ask if there are any updates about it?

310
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,650
After attending the solemn funeral

311
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,375
of my grandmother here in Youyang,

312
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,675
I remembered the lonely tomb

313
00:17:06,675 --> 00:17:07,975
of Little Mother in Yangzhou.

314
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,119
I've already set up her memorial tablet

315
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:10,950
in Yuqing Monastery in Bianjing

316
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,350
with incense and candles lit for her.

317
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,751
If Auntie goes to the capital,

318
00:17:15,751 --> 00:17:16,825
you can go visit it.

319
00:17:17,525 --> 00:17:18,475
Lastly,

320
00:17:18,475 --> 00:17:20,175
I wish you good health.

321
00:17:26,175 --> 00:17:27,700
I heard that because Youyang is a remote region,

322
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,925
there are

323
00:17:28,925 --> 00:17:29,800
no postal shops.

324
00:17:30,225 --> 00:17:32,300
Take this money.

325
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,225
Give it as a tip

326
00:17:33,225 --> 00:17:35,250
to the lad manning the docks.

327
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,075
Tell him to immediately send this letter out.

328
00:17:38,075 --> 00:17:39,000
Yes.

329
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,175
Quickly go.

330
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,675
Auntie,

331
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:02,950
it is snowing heavily,

332
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,900
the weather is cold and the ground chilly.

333
00:18:05,925 --> 00:18:10,075
The trip will be very slippery.

334
00:18:11,325 --> 00:18:12,800
Just let the children go instead.

335
00:18:14,525 --> 00:18:18,150
Mother-in-law would understand your intentions.

336
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,675
Just stay behind.

337
00:19:38,225 --> 00:19:40,025
Protect the coffin!

338
00:19:45,575 --> 00:19:47,900
What's going on?

339
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,650
Little Sister!

340
00:19:55,925 --> 00:19:57,975
Let's get down together.Upon getting down, run!

341
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,200
Where's Minglan?

342
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,075
Minglan!

343
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,625
Minglan!

344
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,600
Where's Minglan? Minglan!

345
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,675
Where are you going?

346
00:20:23,675 --> 00:20:24,800
Minglan!

347
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,550
Minglan!

348
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:35,475
Where did Minglan go?

349
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:03,450
Let go of me!

350
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,225
My father is an official of the government!

351
00:21:05,225 --> 00:21:05,819
My brother is passed

352
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:06,675
the Imperial civil examination!

353
00:21:06,675 --> 00:21:07,750
Let go of me! Let go!

354
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,900
Brat, are you crazy!

355
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,675
It's me!

356
00:21:14,225 --> 00:21:15,250
Second Uncle Gu!

357
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,200
If you continue to poke like that,

358
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,550
my leg will get disabled from it!

359
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,225
Auntie.

360
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,300
Is everyone okay?

361
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,925
Has Mother been buried?

362
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,600
What happened?

363
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,900
It's very chaotic out in the streets.

364
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,125
The coffin of Mother

365
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,525
was entrusted appropriately to a decent family.

366
00:21:50,525 --> 00:21:51,475
We can only go out of the city

367
00:21:51,475 --> 00:21:52,475
once the soldiers have left.

368
00:21:52,775 --> 00:21:53,400
Where's my Ming'er?

369
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:55,500
Where's my Miss?

370
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,925
Sixth Miss is missing!

371
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,650
She got separated from us.

372
00:22:00,925 --> 00:22:01,654
We couldn't find her

373
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:02,750
after searching the whole day.

374
00:22:03,425 --> 00:22:04,950
First, the bandits entered the city.

375
00:22:05,675 --> 00:22:06,900
Afterwards, a troop of soldiers came.

376
00:22:07,275 --> 00:22:08,925
They said they were being led by some captain.

377
00:22:09,175 --> 00:22:10,400
Shut up!

378
00:22:12,275 --> 00:22:13,920
How could you leave Ming'er behind

379
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,700
and come back here by yourselves!

380
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,600
Auntie.

381
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,350
Go! Go on!

382
00:22:17,825 --> 00:22:20,050
Go and find my Ming'er!

383
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,475
Auntie.

384
00:22:21,475 --> 00:22:23,025
Men! Men!

385
00:22:23,025 --> 00:22:23,800
Men,

386
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,400
go and search!

387
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,225
Search!

388
00:22:25,225 --> 00:22:25,825
Go quickly!Hurry up!

389
00:22:25,825 --> 00:22:26,325
Hurry!

390
00:22:30,825 --> 00:22:32,350
She was gone for a long time...

391
00:22:33,175 --> 00:22:34,050
Quick!

392
00:22:46,025 --> 00:22:47,700
Here, Sixth Miss.

393
00:22:49,275 --> 00:22:50,675
Drink something warm.

394
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,375
You must be freezing.

395
00:23:15,725 --> 00:23:18,200
Second Uncle Gu, you've joined the army?

396
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:19,425
That's right.

397
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:21,450
I'm thinking that since there's an uprising,

398
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:22,750
this is a good chance.

399
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,650
I sent someone to get me a recommendation

400
00:23:25,675 --> 00:23:27,025
from a friend in Yuzhou,

401
00:23:27,025 --> 00:23:27,975
and then joined the army.

402
00:23:33,075 --> 00:23:35,300
Young Master! Young Master!

403
00:23:37,975 --> 00:23:39,050
Yongquan's streets have now been pacified.

404
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,925
Sixth Miss?

405
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,525
How are the front gates?

406
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:48,750
Just as you predicted,

407
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,750
once the western gates were closed

408
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,125
those bandits felt lost

409
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:52,225
and they've escaped toward the front gates.

410
00:23:52,225 --> 00:23:53,225
We now only need to take care of the path ahead

411
00:23:53,225 --> 00:23:54,625
and our mission is complete.

412
00:23:55,775 --> 00:23:57,150
Tell them that I ordered this.

413
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,475
Once Youyang has been pacified,

414
00:23:58,475 --> 00:24:00,150
tell them to follow me

415
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,600
for some food and drinks from the local magistrate's office.

416
00:24:02,575 --> 00:24:04,500
Thank you Yuhou. You've achieved great success.

417
00:24:04,975 --> 00:24:06,100
We are quite

418
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,225
fated with Sixth Miss.

419
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,550
Get out of here,Brother!

420
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,550
Second Uncle Gu,

421
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,475
why are you still just a yuhou?

422
00:24:27,175 --> 00:24:28,725
Are you saying that my position is too low?

423
00:24:28,725 --> 00:24:29,900
Absolutely not!

424
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,050
I just feel that

425
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:32,588
if you want to get promoted

426
00:24:32,588 --> 00:24:34,300
from yuhou to a deputy commander,

427
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,800
you went to the wrong place.

428
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:39,900
Why do you say so?

429
00:24:43,075 --> 00:24:44,375
Although there are disturbances in Youyang now,

430
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:45,725
this is just temporary.

431
00:24:45,725 --> 00:24:47,100
There really aren't any major military battles.

432
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,075
If you come here,

433
00:24:50,075 --> 00:24:51,550
you can't really achieve any military merit.

434
00:24:52,175 --> 00:24:53,875
If you are on the front line fighting,

435
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:54,975
won't you get promoted more easily?

436
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,650
Do you know why

437
00:24:58,425 --> 00:24:59,800
I'm not on the front line?

438
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,925
Naturally, it's because you are too proud

439
00:25:04,425 --> 00:25:05,325
and offended your superior.

440
00:25:07,425 --> 00:25:08,850
I indeed offended my superior,

441
00:25:09,225 --> 00:25:10,525
but it wasn't for being too haughty.

442
00:25:14,175 --> 00:25:15,575
Then...it's because you've

443
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,125
achieved victory in a very fast manner,

444
00:25:19,425 --> 00:25:20,450
and thus are blocking someone else's path.

445
00:25:22,075 --> 00:25:23,000
Am I right?

446
00:25:24,275 --> 00:25:25,675
I thought that

447
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:28,875
you'd go back to Bianjing,

448
00:25:28,975 --> 00:25:29,900
or maybe

449
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,775
join the army of the House of Gu?

450
00:25:32,725 --> 00:25:34,175
Never thought that you'd join the Imperial army.

451
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,825
Looks like I had it wrong.

452
00:25:36,975 --> 00:25:38,250
In this world,

453
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,944
if you rely on a mountain, it might topple.

454
00:25:40,944 --> 00:25:42,200
If you rely on people, they might flee.

455
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:44,875
Meritorious deeds that I myself earned

456
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:46,225
through one sword, one spear,

457
00:25:46,225 --> 00:25:47,425
I find that to be an honor.

458
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,750
From now on,

459
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,475
I don't need to live for anyone.

460
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:53,141
I just wish that I can

461
00:25:53,141 --> 00:25:54,175
have a carefree and happy life.

462
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,475
Why are you offering me a toast?

463
00:26:07,575 --> 00:26:08,550
I admire you.

464
00:26:10,975 --> 00:26:11,975
If...

465
00:26:13,425 --> 00:26:15,000
If I can live for myself,

466
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,900
my life won't be in vain.

467
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:22,575
As long as you want to, you can.

468
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,200
I...

469
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,300
I can't.

470
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,525
You can.

471
00:26:28,425 --> 00:26:29,825
I can't.

472
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,075
Young Master!

473
00:26:34,275 --> 00:26:35,050
Young Master!

474
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,900
We've cleanly swept away the bandits ahead.

475
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,550
Guess what?

476
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,200
I heard that this area

477
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,450
is the old hometown of Sixth Miss' family.

478
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:42,875
I heard that

479
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:44,075
her family has asked help from

480
00:26:44,075 --> 00:26:44,800
the local magistrate

481
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,675
to look for her.

482
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,250
Since...

483
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,775
the bandits have already been removed

484
00:26:51,775 --> 00:26:52,650
from the streets,

485
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:55,075
quickly go home then.

486
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,925
Young Master,

487
00:26:58,125 --> 00:26:59,575
you're not escorting Sixth Miss?

488
00:27:01,925 --> 00:27:02,775
I won't any further.

489
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:07,475
Thank you for saving me

490
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,050
and understanding.

491
00:27:09,675 --> 00:27:11,475
Shitou, give me your sleeve arrow.

492
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,550
Take this sleeve arrow with you.

493
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,150
If you meet any bad people along the way,

494
00:27:20,725 --> 00:27:21,875
throw it at them.

495
00:27:22,275 --> 00:27:23,475
You can then save yourself.

496
00:27:26,525 --> 00:27:27,875
What is this?

497
00:27:28,025 --> 00:27:28,675
A sleeve arrow.

498
00:27:34,525 --> 00:27:36,075
You could aim perfectly in playing touhu.

499
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:38,625
How could you miss in shooting a sleeve arrow?

500
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:14,525
Don't make a sound.

501
00:28:15,075 --> 00:28:16,200
If you do,

502
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,325
I'll hack you to death!

503
00:28:18,025 --> 00:28:19,025
Leave behind your valuables.

504
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,350
I...

505
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,050
Don't move!

506
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,300
You...

507
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:31,375
Stop right there!

508
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:32,425
Don't come near me!

509
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:39,675
I...

510
00:28:42,975 --> 00:28:45,000
Y-Y-You... Don't come near me!

511
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,475
Stop right there!

512
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,725
Heroine, spare my life!

513
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:57,050
Heroine, spare my life!

514
00:29:25,175 --> 00:29:27,000
Young Master, all your shots are on target.

515
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,025
Always so precise. Such high-level archery skills.

516
00:29:29,775 --> 00:29:30,500
Are you seeking Sixth Miss

517
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,450
for a reward?

518
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,425
Bullshit!

519
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:36,125
I almost missed earlier.

520
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,600
That damned little brat!

521
00:29:40,675 --> 00:29:41,709
I just praised her as being refined

522
00:29:41,709 --> 00:29:42,450
and open-minded earlier.

523
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,750
Upon turning around, she became like that.

524
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,825
She really thinks she's some divine archer?

525
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,800
When did you say that

526
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,050
she's refined and broad-minded?

527
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,325
You didn't hear it?

528
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,250
Were you saying it in your heart?

529
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,250
Young Master, if you ask me,

530
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,200
if you're this worried about her,

531
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,900
you should have personally

532
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,825
escorted her home.

533
00:30:12,825 --> 00:30:13,875
Why must we

534
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:15,075
sneakily

535
00:30:15,075 --> 00:30:16,150
follow behind her

536
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,625
and shoot sleeve arrows to protect her?

537
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,040
You don't understand the matters

538
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,675
of the internal household.

539
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:23,100
If she gets seen by others

540
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,375
associating with a male outsider

541
00:30:25,375 --> 00:30:26,250
during a funerary mourning period,

542
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,300
that's a crime.

543
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,425
Then...

544
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,775
Wouldn't it have been better

545
00:30:32,775 --> 00:30:33,500
if we had her change

546
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,275
her mourning clothes first?

547
00:30:35,175 --> 00:30:35,775
Nonsense.

548
00:30:36,475 --> 00:30:37,525
If she changed her clothes

549
00:30:37,525 --> 00:30:38,275
and gets seen by

550
00:30:38,275 --> 00:30:39,350
those nitpicking people,

551
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,175
they surely will gossip.

552
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:40,827
It's better this way.

553
00:30:40,827 --> 00:30:41,475
It will be more convenient for us all.

554
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,352
It's still Young Master

555
00:30:44,352 --> 00:30:44,950
who thinks more thoroughly.

556
00:30:47,175 --> 00:30:49,375
This has the same principles as fighting a battle.

557
00:30:49,825 --> 00:30:52,000
It's just that their battlefield

558
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,250
isn't on the back of a horse.

559
00:30:58,825 --> 00:31:00,225
What should we do, Sister?

560
00:31:13,775 --> 00:31:15,825
Second House Old Madam

561
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:18,100
Second House Old Madam, Big Madam,

562
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,000
and Master are all so anxious.

563
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Miss, you're back!

564
00:31:22,725 --> 00:31:23,675
Grandmother!

565
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:24,875
She's back.

566
00:31:24,875 --> 00:31:25,600
Grandmother!

567
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,975
She's back!

568
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,250
Miss!

569
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,850
Minglan, you're back!

570
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:30,650
Minglan!

571
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:32,000
Little Sister, are you alright?

572
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:34,875
Ming'er!

573
00:31:35,275 --> 00:31:36,400
Grandmother!

574
00:31:39,425 --> 00:31:40,375
Grandmother!

575
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,875
Grandmother!

576
00:31:44,775 --> 00:31:47,175
Grandmother, are you alright? I'm back.

577
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,375
Why did you just come back now?

578
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:53,550
Why did you just come back now?

579
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,500
Grandmother.

580
00:31:57,175 --> 00:31:58,450
It's good that you're back.

581
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,500
Quickly come here.

582
00:32:01,925 --> 00:32:02,850
Ming'er.

583
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:05,775
Ming'er.

584
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:07,200
Grandmother.

585
00:32:10,025 --> 00:32:11,550
You're finally back.

586
00:32:14,075 --> 00:32:15,600
Thank you, Bodhisattva for your blessings.

587
00:32:15,925 --> 00:32:17,375
You scared us!

588
00:32:17,375 --> 00:32:19,925
It must be Eldest Old Madam's soul in heaven

589
00:32:19,925 --> 00:32:21,850
who blessed this child

590
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:23,525
to come back home safely.

591
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:28,800
Last time, when we met some bandits,

592
00:32:29,975 --> 00:32:31,400
I already felt that something bad might happen.

593
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,200
Never thought,

594
00:32:33,225 --> 00:32:35,100
that trouble would really come to us.

595
00:32:35,525 --> 00:32:38,175
Our Youyang is so far from the southern border,

596
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,950
yet there are indeed rogues here.

597
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:41,850
Is the world

598
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:43,100
getting chaotic?

599
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:45,825
We initially planned to

600
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,250
leave after the New Year.

601
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:49,100
But with the current situation,

602
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,650
I fear that we can't wait anymore.

603
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:52,800
Grandniece-in-law,

604
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:56,950
once your mother-in-law gets buried tomorrow,

605
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,500
we'll go back to the capital.

606
00:33:00,525 --> 00:33:01,950
People from the local magistrate came to report

607
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:03,300
that some of the bandits have been killed,

608
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,325
while some have been captured

609
00:33:04,325 --> 00:33:05,325
and won't pose any threat.

610
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,100
Why don't you stay for a few more days

611
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,150
to recover from the trauma before leaving?

612
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:10,600
Yes.

613
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:13,175
It's not only because of the bandits.

614
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:15,407
I fear more that there might be

615
00:33:15,407 --> 00:33:16,550
turmoil in the Imperial court.

616
00:33:18,225 --> 00:33:21,025
Auntie, I won't ask you to stay then.

617
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,200
I surely will find you a good boat.

618
00:33:23,725 --> 00:33:26,375
No, water travel is too slow.

619
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:28,225
It's better to travel by land.

620
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,150
Young Master,

621
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,950
we're on the same travel path

622
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,200
as Sheng House back to the capital.

623
00:34:47,525 --> 00:34:48,625
Why don't we let them know

624
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:49,850
and we can travel together?

625
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,050
It's more bustling to have more people.

626
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,900
What's there to bustle about?

627
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,375
They are all womankind.

628
00:34:56,175 --> 00:34:57,250
How inconvenient is it to add to them?

629
00:34:58,475 --> 00:34:59,425
Also,

630
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,750
I need to bring Rong'er

631
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:02,650
back to the capital.

632
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,525
Sixth Miss was right.

633
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:07,900
If Rong'er continues to

634
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,200
drift around homeless like this with me,

635
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,525
she'll become a wild girl for sure.

636
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:12,900
I don't know

637
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,750
what bad luck

638
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:15,825
the Sixth Miss has got.

639
00:35:15,825 --> 00:35:17,100
How come she keeps running into bandits?

640
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:19,375
It's not that she keeps running into bandits,

641
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:22,325
but that the bandits are rampant everywhere.

642
00:35:42,725 --> 00:35:44,150
All here.

643
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,925
Rest and let them do it.

644
00:35:45,925 --> 00:35:46,950
Nest rolls.

645
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:47,775
Sit.

646
00:35:50,175 --> 00:35:51,575
Young Master, meat.

647
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,100
Father!

648
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,300
Why aren't we eating at the food stand?

649
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,250
Father's out of money now.

650
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:02,925
Finish it up.

651
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:08,800
Then let our horse

652
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,025
go faster.

653
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,425
I want to see Nanny Chang sooner.

654
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:19,725
Rong'er, it's getting cold now.

655
00:36:20,925 --> 00:36:22,325
The wind's blown your father a headache.

656
00:36:22,575 --> 00:36:23,625
I can't ride that fast.

657
00:36:40,575 --> 00:36:41,700
Blow, blow, blow.

658
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,075
No more ache.

659
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,350
Headache's flown away.

660
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:49,850
So good.

661
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,350
Rong'er is Father's good girl.

662
00:36:56,675 --> 00:36:57,550
Father,

663
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,800
do we need to go slowly?

664
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,425
To escort that big sister

665
00:37:01,425 --> 00:37:03,925
that fell into the river?

666
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,625
That's not a big sister.

667
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:08,800
Her older brother

668
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,400
is your father's true brother,

669
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,000
Uncle Sheng. Do you remember?

670
00:37:12,725 --> 00:37:14,475
So you need to call her "aunt".

671
00:37:14,825 --> 00:37:16,025
Auntie?

672
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:22,000
Young Master.

673
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,375
Sixth Miss calls you Second Uncle Gu.

674
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:27,675
Miss Rong calls Sixth Miss, "aunt".

675
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,075
That hierarchy is all messed up.

676
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,675
Just take a hike!

677
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:36,500
Thanks for the reward, Young Master.

678
00:37:37,325 --> 00:37:39,325
Auntie. Auntie.

679
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:40,900
Auntie.

680
00:38:10,325 --> 00:38:11,850
Rest here.

681
00:38:20,025 --> 00:38:21,875
Grandmother, the soup is ready!

682
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,375
Alright.I'm coming.

683
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:32,200
Dust.

684
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,000
Is there?

685
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,100
Wipe it.

686
00:38:41,075 --> 00:38:42,300
If I were you,

687
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,175
I wouldn't try to mess with

688
00:38:43,175 --> 00:38:44,475
those at the bottom of the hill.

689
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,300
Buddy, I am from the Canal Gang with the family name "Shi".

690
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:53,100
If you give me the courtesy today

691
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,525
to let go of the fat goat,

692
00:38:54,525 --> 00:38:56,325
my Canal Gang will repay this courtesy.

693
00:38:57,925 --> 00:38:58,750
Shitou.

694
00:39:01,025 --> 00:39:01,875
Good girl.

695
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:04,025
Father's going to fight, but don't get scared.

696
00:39:10,175 --> 00:39:11,400
Careful, Father!

697
00:39:14,675 --> 00:39:15,575
Go.

698
00:39:25,475 --> 00:39:26,950
"Memorial to Yueyang Tower."

699
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,000
"Qinli, fourth spring in reign,

700
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Teng Zijing was relegated to Baning County.

701
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,300
The second year,

702
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,198
the government was apt

703
00:39:34,198 --> 00:39:35,975
and the people lived happily and peacefully,

704
00:39:35,975 --> 00:39:38,800
and renovated Yueyang Tower.

705
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,175
Expanding from its old scale,

706
00:39:41,175 --> 00:39:44,425
engraving the great poem of Tang talents.

707
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,225
So allow me to commemorate it with this prose.

708
00:39:46,225 --> 00:39:48,075
As I see it, the beauty of Baling County

709
00:39:48,075 --> 00:39:49,100
Kill him!

710
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,175
is in Lake Dongting.

711
00:39:50,175 --> 00:39:52,000
Connecting the far mountains to Yangtze River.

712
00:39:52,025 --> 00:39:53,375
Majestic and surging. Broad and boundless.

713
00:39:53,375 --> 00:39:55,232
Bright morning sunshine melting into evening mist.

714
00:39:55,232 --> 00:39:57,225
Changes in season in a variety.

715
00:39:57,225 --> 00:39:59,424
This is the most spectacular sight

716
00:39:59,424 --> 00:40:00,650
from Yueyang Tower.

717
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,612
Past descriptions about it

718
00:40:01,612 --> 00:40:02,500
are already very detailed.

719
00:40:02,575 --> 00:40:04,475
And then going north to Wuxia,

720
00:40:04,575 --> 00:40:05,138
going south to reach

721
00:40:05,138 --> 00:40:05,950
the two rivers Xiao and Xiang,

722
00:40:05,975 --> 00:40:07,001
most depressed travelers

723
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:08,675
and grieving poets would gather here.

724
00:40:08,675 --> 00:40:09,595
Would their feelings

725
00:40:09,595 --> 00:40:11,325
in admiring the scenery be the same?

726
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,525
Drizzling rain continues to fall,

727
00:40:13,525 --> 00:40:15,400
the sky was cloudy for several months.

728
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,605
The cold wind fiercely blows,

729
00:40:16,605 --> 00:40:17,942
the muddy waves rage up to the sky.

730
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:19,360
The light of the sun and stars fade out.

731
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,917
The body of the mountain ranges is obscured.

732
00:40:20,925 --> 00:40:21,507
Merchants and tourists

733
00:40:21,507 --> 00:40:22,400
can't proceed with their travels.

734
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,750
Sails are toppling down, boat oars breaking up.

735
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:24,679
When dusk comes and the sky gets dark,

736
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:25,397
there will be howling of tigers

737
00:40:25,397 --> 00:40:26,300
and sad cries of gorillas being heard.

738
00:40:26,325 --> 00:40:27,575
If you go up this platform now,

739
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:28,963
afraid of getting hurt by people's words,

740
00:40:28,963 --> 00:40:29,950
getting mocked by evil people.

741
00:40:33,125 --> 00:40:34,425
My eyes are desolate,

742
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:36,850
and I can feel that deep sorrow in my heart."

743
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:00,200
If you can relay a message from me

744
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,525
to all your brothers

745
00:41:02,525 --> 00:41:03,950
to let that fat sheep go,

746
00:41:04,675 --> 00:41:05,650
we all can

747
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:07,000
peacefully celebrate our New Year then.

748
00:41:41,825 --> 00:41:42,725
They're here.

749
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,150
Let's go back to the city.

750
00:41:44,575 --> 00:41:45,525
Okay, Young Master.

751
00:41:45,925 --> 00:41:47,250
Let's go.

752
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:54,950
Father.

753
00:41:56,925 --> 00:41:57,775
Thank you, Father.

754
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,375
Let's go.

755
00:41:59,375 --> 00:42:00,650
Quickly go back.

756
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:01,650
Okay. Okay.

757
00:42:03,375 --> 00:42:04,800
You must be tired. Is everyone okay?

758
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:15,700
Nanny, I'll go open the gates.

759
00:42:17,575 --> 00:42:18,525
Give that to me.

760
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,350
Go away!

761
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:21,950
Go and beg from other people's houses!

762
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,950
Bodhisattva didn't bless our home anyway!

763
00:42:26,275 --> 00:42:27,450
Who are you?

764
00:42:27,975 --> 00:42:28,725
Young Master.

765
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:30,850
Nanny, I'm back.

766
00:42:32,275 --> 00:42:33,300
Nanny.

767
00:42:34,425 --> 00:42:35,275
Ye!

768
00:42:36,625 --> 00:42:37,650
You're back!

769
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,350
Nanny,

770
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:40,200
you're back!

771
00:42:41,675 --> 00:42:43,775
Quickly go inside.

772
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:45,775
Let's go.

773
00:42:45,775 --> 00:42:46,725
Get inside.
