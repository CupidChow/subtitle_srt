00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,148
Episode 63

3
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,960
I'm an official's wife.

4
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,320
Let's see who dares to touch me?

5
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,600
These two senior maidservants are both

6
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,000
from the manor of the rebel prince.

7
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,600
They've seen a lot of people with your status.

8
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,720
Why would they

9
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,280
not dare to touch you?

10
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,840
You bitch!

11
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,360
Let s go.

12
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:18,880
You

13
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,040
My husband and maternal family are both...

14
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,160
Let go of me!

15
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,800
I'm an official's wife!

16
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,360
I'm an official's wife! Let go of me!

17
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,760
Has father returned?

18
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,640
He came back once

19
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,660
and was so mad.

20
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,680
Then, he went to his study.

21
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,360
In a little while more

22
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,760
I'll ask the guards blocking all our exits

23
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,440
to leave.

24
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,560
Why?

25
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,720
I've already captured the people

26
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,480
that should be captured.

27
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,680
Only a few more are left, but that's fine.

28
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,960
If our house keep shutting its doors,

29
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,520
no one coming in or out,

30
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,260
having a situation that's very different from before,

31
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,000
our neighbors would suspect something.

32
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,680
Father is still bothered by reputation the most.

33
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,320
You decide.

34
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,040
Main Mother,

35
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,280
if our gates open,

36
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,440
the news of grandmother getting sick

37
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,320
and that Maternal Aunt Kang

38
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,080
is inside our manor

39
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,440
will all get out.

40
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,440
If Maternal Aunt Kang didn't get pointed out,

41
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,000
and the House of Wang

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,120
comes to ask for her

43
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,960
this matter might

44
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,880
just end up

45
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,640
on you alone.

46
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,640
In just a few more while

47
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,360
I'll be able to find out the truth.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,640
You also can be partly cleared from your involvement.

49
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,960
I understand. I understand.

50
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,920
If the House of Kang comes to ask

51
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,680
we'll say

52
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,680
we'll say that things have been stolen.

53
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,480
That was a collusion between the outside and inside.

54
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,760
Not only did we lose valuable items

55
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,000
but also it traumatized Old Madam to sickness.

56
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,080
Hence, we asked eldest sister to come help us

57
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,200
to look for the missing items.

58
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,760
This might take up 1 to 2 days

59
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,040
of eldest sister's time, but

60
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,520
But, who's the internal spy?

61
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,800
We must give an explanation about that.

62
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,800
Of course, it's Caihuai.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,400
Not only did she steal valuable things,

64
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,546
but also she sowed discord to wreak havoc

65
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,120
inside the household.

66
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,880
She then would be punished for everything.

67
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,920
Minglan!

68
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,320
That bitch Caihuai indeed

69
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,350
should be beaten and killed.

70
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,720
But she came to my side

71
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,490
since she was a child,

72
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,320
and had attended to me for almost 2 decades.

73
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,720
She has already been caned.

74
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,880
Why not just spare her life

75
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,860
and expel her out?

76
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,960
Main Mother, what do you intend to do?

77
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,840
Caihuai followed me for decades.

78
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,800
I saw her and Nanny Liu

79
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,800
more than I've seen your father.

80
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,800
She just wanted curry favor

81
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,320
and wanted me to dote on her more.

82
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,560
She doesn't know anything.

83
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,400
If you really want to punish her

84
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,920
just let her do hard labor.

85
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,040
Main Madam

86
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,560
you've raised my older brother and sisters

87
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,000
very well.

88
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,840
I don't believe that they grew up

89
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,880
so well out of nowhere.

90
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,280
It must because you had

91
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,440
meticulously taught them.

92
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,320
When I was little, I once asked grandmother

93
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,320
why she would choose you

94
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,440
as a daughter-in-law

95
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,320
when you have this kind of personality.

96
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,440
She said that even though

97
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,800
you have so many faults,

98
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,280
you have one good trait of being soft hearted.

99
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,600
Even if you're given a knife,

100
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,800
you will never think about

101
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,000
killing anyone.

102
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,080
But it's also exactly because of this

103
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,560
you're easily manipulated.

104
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,840
With an evil person

105
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,720
like your eldest sister by your side,

106
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,800
grandmother has always been worried.

107
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,600
If in the future, you can understand everything,

108
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,080
if you can stay away from that sinister woman,

109
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,200
grandmother will still be at ease

110
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,480
to hand you the right to manage the house.

111
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,200
She'll also let you show off

112
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,520
your mother-in-law status.

113
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,360
The whole family is

114
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,720
living a comfortable life.

115
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,920
Move! Move!

116
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,960
Hurry up! Move!

117
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,080
Behave!

118
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,180
Behave!

119
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,240
Hurry.

120
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,320
Sit!

121
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,140
Sit!

122
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,440
All of you better behave.

123
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,560
Nanny Qi

124
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,320
my Big Madam isn't good in dealing with these

125
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,160
and has already fainted.

126
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,572
It's all thanks to your Big Madam

127
00:07:10,572 --> 00:07:11,320
for keeping everything in order.

128
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,560
She asked me to come here to relay a message of

129
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,000
asking a few more of her trusted aides to go there.

130
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,360
She specifically asked for Stewards Qi.

131
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,120
My sons?

132
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,040
Why didn't my Big Madam

133
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,000
ask the people

134
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,200
who went with her to call me?

135
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,000
Nanny Qi

136
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,640
it's already a big mess in our house.

137
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:28,680
Those few capable ones

138
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,240
are so busy right now

139
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,120
How can they come here?

140
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,960
I especially came here

141
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,000
after settling my Big Madam down.

142
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,040
There's not much time.

143
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,080
Quickly call some more trusted aides

144
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,960
and let's go!

145
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,800
Once our Old Madam's funeral is over

146
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,520
our House of Sheng

147
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,320
will surely come over

148
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,520
and thank everyone.

149
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,360
Look at how many work still must be done

150
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,440
here in our own courtyard.

151
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,875
These few maidservants are also capable.

152
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,400
Why don't you just take them with you?

153
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,280
Your Big Madam said

154
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,480
that she only wants the two Steward Qi.

155
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
No need for anyone else.

156
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,920
Must it really be my sons?

157
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,000
Fine.

158
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,440
Go.

159
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,720
Go and call the two Steward Qi

160
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,720
over here.

161
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,230
They even said that this Sheng Family

162
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,320
is an illustrious scholarly family

163
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:41,960
but a woman

164
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:43,720
must crowd with us two men

165
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,520
in one carriage.

166
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,200
Isn't that right?

167
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,600
And she kept watching us.

168
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,080
So unruly.

169
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,360
Quickly!

170
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,160
They've been waiting for you.

171
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,840
Let go of me! What are you doing?!

172
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,520
Let go of me!

173
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,160
Nanny Qi is old after all.

174
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,960
Her energy isn't that good anymore.

175
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,320
She surely can't handle the matters

176
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,240
outside of your house

177
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,280
better than her sons.

178
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,860
Hence, our head here said that

179
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,720
rather than arresting her,

180
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,120
it's better to capture you two.

181
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,040
Take them away!

182
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,760
Let go of me!

183
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,840
We are from the House of Kang.

184
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,120
Even if your Sheng Family

185
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,680
has any conflict with our Big Madam,

186
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,000
you mustn't vent your anger at us!

187
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,360
You can only speak when you're spoken to.

188
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,320
My grandmother is sick.

189
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,240
She was poisoned by your Big Madam.

190
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,720
I asked you all to come

191
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,600
to talk about this.

192
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,560
My Bodhisattva,

193
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,640
you must have gotten it wrong.

194
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,720
For such a grave matter,

195
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,960
how could our Big Madam

196
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,440
Is there anyone disciplining you people in your manor?

197
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,680
How come you can't understand human language?

198
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,320
I already said that

199
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,600
you can only speak when we allow you to.

200
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,960
The Sheng Family will be confronting

201
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,080
your Big Madam soon.

202
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,880
Hence, I must trouble all of you.

203
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,800
Anyone related to this matter,

204
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,840
whether it's just a needle or a thread,

205
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,080
may you all please say it.

206
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,880
I will heavily reward you.

207
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,480
You're now being asked to speak.

208
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,240
Have you all become mute?!

209
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,840
I came with Big Madam

210
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,440
I came with Big Madam from the House of Wang

211
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,320
as part of her dowry.

212
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,280
I owed the House of Wang great kindness.

213
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,840
I won't be able to repay them even

214
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,040
if I sacrifice my life.

215
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,320
If you want to use silver

216
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,320
to make me slander Big Madam,

217
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,440
no way!

218
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,360
Look.

219
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,120
Loyal servants.

220
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,520
We still don't know if your loyalty

221
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,280
is worthy or not.

222
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,200
Even a bandit who has killed so many people

223
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,520
would have one or two loyal servants in house.

224
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,200
Take her in!

225
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,760
This is the internal spy

226
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,560
who was colluding with your Big Madam.

227
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,240
I now have complete material evidence and witness.

228
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,000
I just want you people

229
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,760
to say

230
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,800
some righteous words,

231
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,720
but no one dared to.

232
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,680
Let me be honest with you all.

233
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,200
Don't your Big Madam even think of

234
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,520
going back anymore.

235
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,720
What do you plan to do with Big Madam?

236
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,040
You still have time to think about her?

237
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,720
You better think about yourselves first.

238
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,080
Think about if you can still go back

239
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,880
still go back

240
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,840
in one piece.

241
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,160
Madam,

242
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,040
Madam, Nanny Liu has already brought

243
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,360
the people that you asked for.

244
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,200
Come in.

245
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,240
Despicable!

246
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,360
Despicable!

247
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,360
You lowly people!

248
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:28,880
Shut up, you bastard!

249
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,360
Sheng Family, you are murderers!

250
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,080
Shut up.

251
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,560
You can only talk when asked to.

252
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,600
Do you know them?

253
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,640
Eldest Steward Qi,

254
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,600
Second Steward Qi.

255
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,080
They are trusted aides

256
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,080
of your Big Madam.

257
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,520
Even if you all are strong and won't talk,

258
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,520
the two of them just do external household duties.

259
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,240
They surely can't be as tight-lipped,

260
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:56,920
right?

261
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,160
Sir Second Tu,

262
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,040
have to trouble you then.

263
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,200
Separate these two.

264
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,960
One in each room.

265
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,960
I want to see

266
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,840
who doesn't want to go back

267
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,280
in one piece.

268
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,040
Yes.

269
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,200
Is one day enough?

270
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,880
For people like them,

271
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,960
taking half a day

272
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,960
is already tainting my reputation.

273
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,640
That one is

274
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,960
a loyal and unyielding servant.

275
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,480
I'm thinking that

276
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,720
since she's loyal and tight-lipped,

277
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,720
she surely knows a lot too.

278
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,680
Sir Second Tu

279
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,720
personally takes care of her then please.

280
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,160
Yes.

281
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,160
Let go of me!

282
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,840
You've heard the conversations

283
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,880
of the other room, right?

284
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,240
Let me go!

285
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,960
You little bitch,

286
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,560
I've belittled you!

287
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,680
Never knew that your Sheng Family

288
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,160
would come up with a person like you!

289
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,960
You counted the time.

290
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,080
If no one noticed it,

291
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,160
my grandmother would have died in pain.

292
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,240
If there was anyone who noticed,

293
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,680
my main mother would be the first suspect.

294
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,160
If you get dragged into this,

295
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,400
there are still a long line of excuses that can be used.

296
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,000
It will take at least 3 to 5 days

297
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,080
before we really get to your Kang Manor.

298
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,880
You ruthless and heartless thing.

299
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,360
You will get your retribution sooner or later!

300
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,000
You think that by capturing a few lowly servants,

301
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,680
you're already great?

302
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,975
No one would believe people

303
00:14:46,975 --> 00:14:47,840
who confesses after being tortured.

304
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:48,760
You want me to confess?!

305
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,040
In your dream!

306
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,360
If you are that capable, torture me then.

307
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,520
Let's see how you're going to explain this

308
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,200
to the Kang and Wang families.

309
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,880
Who wants you to confess?

310
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,520
What's the point of you

311
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,460
confessing or not?

312
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,840
What do you mean then?

313
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,160
Whether you did it or not,

314
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,600
we both know it very well.

315
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,280
I only hate myself

316
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,160
for considering too many things.

317
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,120
I considered the affection I got from the Sheng's.

318
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,720
If I could really go for broke,

319
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,560
I so want to slice you

320
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,320
and bore holes in you,

321
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,720
hang you upside down by the underbeam,

322
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,720
and let you slowly die

323
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,560
from hemorrhaging.

324
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,720
And then put inside a sack,

325
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,960
throw into a mass burial site,

326
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,640
and let the dogs finish you off.

327
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,760
You want to kill me?

328
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,320
You...

329
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,360
You want to kill me

330
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,360
to clear your legitimate mother from this crime?

331
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,240
I don't intend to exonerate her.

332
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,160
Really good.

333
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,320
You silly little sister!

334
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,120
She thinks that after ratting me out,

335
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,920
she'll be fine.

336
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,120
Never thought that

337
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,880
she raised a wolf!

338
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,240
Do it.

339
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,640
What are you doing?

340
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,240
Let go of me!

341
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,120
Move.

342
00:16:01,121 --> 00:16:01,800
Let me go.

343
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,349
What do you want to do.

344
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,320
Servant!

345
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,680
There's a fire!

346
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,560
Let go of me! Let go of me!

347
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,480
Sheng Minglan, you little bitch!

348
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,200
Stuff her mouth.

349
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,560
Don't wait for me to get out!

350
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,080
I'll kill you!

351
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,800
Let go of me!

352
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,640
Thank you, nannies.

353
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,200
The methods of the prince manor is outstanding.

354
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,280
To avoid a person from hurting herself,

355
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,680
this is the best way.

356
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,560
This initially was a trick

357
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,080
from the palace.

358
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,000
It's especially used to deal with

359
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,960
those insensible imperial harem.

360
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,240
Feed her some soup

361
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,560
every 2 to 4 hours.

362
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,400
No need for any other food.

363
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,080
Just let her pee or defecate all she wants.

364
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,360
Madam, don't worry.

365
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,480
We'll surely act very cautiously.

366
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,160
Sheng Minglan!

367
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,600
Deliver that to the southern gate.

368
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,000
Okay.

369
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,880
That to the western gate

370
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,600
Okay.

371
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,000
Okay.

372
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,600
You all leave first.

373
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,040
How did it go?

374
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,480
The letter had already sent out

375
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,320
by four Huangfeng horses

376
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,080
from my family.

377
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,440
Yes, those precious horses.

378
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,320
Madam, don't worry.

379
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,469
Each person gets to ride two alternately.

380
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,400
It will surely be fast.

381
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,880
Okay. I got it.

382
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,560
You can go now.

383
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,160
Okay.

384
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,840
May the gods bless us.

385
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,480
The house is currently undergoing a huge change.

386
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,600
Wish my husband receive the letter soon

387
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,840
and give a decision.

388
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,840
Miss,

389
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,720
people from the House of Wang are here.

390
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,240
What about the House of Kang?

391
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,000
Only a Young Master Jin comes from the House of Kang,

392
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,480
while there are a lot of people from the House of Wang.

393
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,360
Okay.

394
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,120
Wake Xiaotao up.

395
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,360
Tell her that the stage has been set.

396
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,720
They are waiting for us to watch the performance.

397
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,360
Let's go.

398
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,320
Father,

399
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,200
don't you find it strange?

400
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,680
Maternal Aunt Kang didn't go home all night.

401
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,433
The House of Kang isn't anxious,

402
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:48,640
but it's the House of Wang that got so agitated.

403
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,880
In my opinion,

404
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,600
it's all because grandmother got poisoned.

405
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,600
But father, you're wise in observations.

406
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,200
You surely can understand the reasons

407
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,040
even if I don't talk about it.

408
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,360
Yesterday, you even want to eat me.

409
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,160
Now, you're starting to praise

410
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,280
and worship me?

411
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,625
You can really change your face

412
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,520
quicker than turning a page.

413
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,693
I think you have qualities

414
00:20:11,693 --> 00:20:13,200
that's good for the political arena.

415
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,168
In my dumb opinion,

416
00:20:16,168 --> 00:20:18,320
the reason why Maternal Uncle-in-law Kang didn't come

417
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,320
is either because of two things.

418
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,520
One is he knows about this matter

419
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,480
and doesn't really care.

420
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,800
He's unwilling to defend Maternal Aunt Kang.

421
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,800
Another is

422
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,840
he doesn't really know about this matter.

423
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,719
The House of Wang

424
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:33,975
also doesn't want him to know.

425
00:20:33,975 --> 00:20:36,120
Father, am I right?

426
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,640
Since you're not speaking,

427
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,960
I'll treat it as getting the right answer.

428
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,480
Once we see the House of Wang later,

429
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,920
you can ask them

430
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,440
why Maternal Uncle-in-law didn't come.

431
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,800
But

432
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,200
I'm guessing that Cousin Jin of mine

433
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,680
will only say two kinds of reasons.

434
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,680
Either

435
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,040
Maternal Uncle-in-law Kang is sick,

436
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,560
hence, unable to come here;

437
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,739
Or there is something that

438
00:21:03,739 --> 00:21:04,440
needs to be handled in the Kang Manor

439
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:04,975
and Maternal Uncle-in-law

440
00:21:04,975 --> 00:21:05,640
can't extricate himself from it.

441
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,600
But regarding the House of Wang coming here,

442
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,720
there are only three kinds of situation.

443
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,120
First

444
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,200
is that the House of Wang doesn't really know about

445
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,240
the evil deeds of Maternal Aunt Kang.

446
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,320
They came today

447
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,120
just out of concern

448
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,360
regarding grandmother's condition.

449
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,040
Second,

450
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,560
they know about what happened.

451
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,920
They came today

452
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,480
to discuss with you

453
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,280
how Maternal Aunt Kang could be spared.

454
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,440
What about the third?

455
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,200
Someone is harboring evil intentions

456
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,640
of blaming everything

457
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,160
on Main Mother,

458
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,960
blame it all to the Sheng Family.

459
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,920
The people from the House of Wang

460
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,080
are all in the receiving hall now.

461
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,080
I've already sent people

462
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,000
to drive away

463
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,840
all the servants around the area.

464
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,400
If they are not called

465
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,440
even if the house goes on fire

466
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,160
they mustn't come.

467
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,720
If father wants to know the purpose of the Wang s

468
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,840
just go and look.

469
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,320
I decided on my own

470
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,080
and already filed for a leave of absence

471
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,400
from the morning court in your behalf.

472
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,760
The people in the imperial court now

473
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,000
is praising you

474
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,120
for having such devoted filial piety.

475
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,520
Mother.

476
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,800
Virtuous son-in-law,

477
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,920
you're finally here.

478
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,520
Greetings, mother-in-law.

479
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,320
Greetings, Brother-in-law.

480
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,120
Where's your father?

481
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,000
My father is not feeling well today.

482
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,720
Our House of Wang raised such an unfilial daughter.

483
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,600
I really don't have the face to see you.

484
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,640
Mother-in-law, please sit down.

485
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,000
Mother.

486
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,800
I know my mistake now.

487
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,280
Before you marry,

488
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,440
how did I teach you?

489
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,960
But you, really great.

490
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,560
You did an act like this that's worse than a beast!

491
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,240
You have embarrassed

492
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,360
the Wang family.

493
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,880
Mother,

494
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,360
I'm absolutely wrong.

495
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,640
I have embarrassed you.

496
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,400
Mother, I beg you.

497
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,280
You can scold or beat me.

498
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,320
Please let me stay.

499
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,920
Foolish child.

500
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,160
You...

501
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,560
how could you be so muddle headed?

502
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,840
It's easy for me to forgive

503
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,280
and tolerate you,

504
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,840
but how are we going to explain it

505
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,520
to your husband's family?

506
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,400
My good son-in-law,

507
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,320
she harmed her mother-in-law.

508
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,840
It's indeed a major sin.

509
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,440
How do you plan to handle this?

510
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,800
Based on mother-in-law's words,

511
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,800
this matter is just

512
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,160
my wife's mistake?

513
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,480
If not, then?

514
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,680
So to say

515
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,720
Old Madam

516
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,440
you still don't know the truth?

517
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,640
What truth?

518
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,440
Wait.

519
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:43,840
How come...

520
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,600
...you're here?

521
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,320
How come you're in the main hall

522
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,920
listening to the arguments of your elders?

523
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,880
Mother,

524
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,000
it really wasn't me.

525
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,240
It was... was...

526
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:58,960
was...

527
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,040
it was... I...

528
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:02,872
let her in the house

529
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,280
Release me.

530
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,200
Mother.

531
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,360
Mother!

532
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,960
Mother! Mother!

533
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,320
This...you are here.

534
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,560
This...you are here.

535
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,760
I have been harmed badly by them.

536
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,000
Their Sheng s is bullying people intolerably!

537
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,880
I might as well die.

538
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,400
Pitiful Miss.

539
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,320
Since young till now,

540
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,440
you have never suffered like this.

541
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,840
My mother is currently struggling in her death bed.

542
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,920
I haven't cried yet.

543
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,840
Why are you crying first?

544
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,560
May I know what mistake

545
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,840
my daughter did?

546
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,440
As a maternal sister

547
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,440
how come she was detained

548
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,400
in her brother-in-law's house for no reason?

549
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,080
This matter is indeed unheard of.

550
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,080
Madam,

551
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,440
this is Nanny Qi.

552
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,120
She's the top maidservant

553
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,360
of Madam Wang.

554
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,520
So what?

555
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,680
Looks like,

556
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,040
not only are you capable,

557
00:26:12,044 --> 00:26:14,222
even your two sons

558
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,760
were given important tasks by Maternal Aunt.

559
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,440
The elder is speaking. What business is that of yours?

560
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,520
Just casually interrupting.

561
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,075
A child raised by a concubine like you is so unruly!

562
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,000
I was also raised by a concubine.

563
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,360
If not because my legitimate mother is gracious

564
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,000
and saved me in the brink of death,

565
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,200
I wouldn't even have the fortune

566
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,400
of being in-laws with your House of Wang.

567
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,360
A servant from you house

568
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,480
dared to interrupt our talk here,

569
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,840
while my daughter can't even talk

570
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,120
in her own home?!

571
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,720
What kind of rule is this?

572
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,800
Looks like

573
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,960
those useless sons of mine

574
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,160
are in your house.

575
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,800
Really good.

576
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,760
You tricked them out and detained them.

577
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,480
If this gets out

578
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,640
it would be so unbelievable

579
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,440
that a scholarly house like yours would do such a thing!

580
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,920
Nanny Qi, you're so eloquent.

581
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,720
In just a few words

582
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,280
it turns to be our mistakes.

583
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,360
I indeed used some extreme methods.

584
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,760
Your Wang and Kang families may hate me today,

585
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,520
but you surely would be thanking me in the future.

586
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,560
Thank you?

587
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,000
Why would we thank you?

588
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,720
Uncle Wang, you probably are still unaware.

589
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,600
Let me tell you then.

590
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,160
About two months ago,

591
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,360
the Second Steward Qi of the Kang Manor

592
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,960
through the guidance of a broker named You Da,

593
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,200
met an old Daoist priest

594
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,520
in a remote Daoist temple.

595
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,280
What that old priest

596
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,280
is usually best at

597
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,080
is making several kinds of

598
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,440
harmful medicines.

599
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,480
They are usually being sent to

600
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,640
some unpresentable locations.

601
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,720
These are the signed testimonies

602
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,880
of Second Steward Qi and the broker You Da.

603
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,000
This...is all

604
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,960
just my useless son's doing.

605
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,000
Men like him

606
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,920
likes to scheme.

607
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,040
Shut up!

608
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:31,840
Does your Kang Manor

609
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,640
not have any rules anymore?!

610
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,000
The Master is talking.

611
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,200
Who gives you the right to interrupt?!

612
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,680
Second Steward Qi asked that old priest

613
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,680
to make a kind of poison,

614
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,400
which couldn't be tested by the silver needle

615
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,400
and must induce death in a very rapid manner.

616
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:55,920
It's...

617
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,200
That old priest then mentioned an ancient method.

618
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,480
One can make a very concentrated juice

619
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,800
obtained from fifty kilograms

620
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,760
of newly sprouted ginkgo.

621
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,720
If one eats this,

622
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,960
he will die in an hour.

623
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,280
Mother,

624
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,520
is this true?

625
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,960
Shut up.

626
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,000
What do you know?

627
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,600
Oh my God.

628
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,600
It's not finished yet.

629
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,680
Second Steward Qi obtained the formula,

630
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,120
while Eldest Steward Qi

631
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,920
paid 10kg silver as deposit.

632
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,280
That old priest then started to purchase the ingredients.

633
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,240
Because he required a huge amount

634
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,080
private farmers were unable to supply him.

635
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,360
That old priest then

636
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,400
found four remote shops.

637
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,480
He bought all

638
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,680
their old stocks.

639
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,440
These were all copied

640
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,560
from the delivery books of those four shops

641
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,680
and the testimony of the shop managers.

642
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,800
Only within 7 or 8 days,

643
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,080
that old Daoist priest bought

644
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,680
60 kilograms of newly sprouted ginkgo.

645
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,200
That old priest worked day and night,

646
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,240
and finally able to refine three bottles of poison.

647
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,920
Eldest Steward Qi then gave him

648
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,880
40kg silver more.

649
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,480
But that old priest

650
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,040
only gave him two bottles of poison

651
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,120
and left one bottle for himself.

652
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,520
Lord, this is the bottle.

653
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:04,880
Ginkgo!

654
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,960
Just to show her filial piety, our house's Big Madam

655
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,480
kept sending grandmother

656
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,120
some of her favorite food lately.

657
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,080
But she didn't go that day.

658
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,480
It was instead a male servant from the Kang Manor,

659
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,800
called Jin Liu, who delivered it.

660
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,560
After two hours,

661
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,320
Eldest Steward Qi personally delivered the food

662
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,040
to our Sheng Manor

663
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,000
and handed it to Big Madam.

664
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,480
That is the signed testimony

665
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,480
of Eldest Steward Qi.

666
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:11,800
I...

667
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,960
I... I really don't know

668
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,840
this was poison.

669
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,640
I thought she would just be weak for 1 or 2 days.

670
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:24,320
I really, really don't know.

671
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,880
Where is my son?

672
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,160
You are really ruthless and evil.

673
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,040
What are you trying to do?

674
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,760
I'm ruthless and evil?

675
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,600
Yes, I'm ruthless and evil.

676
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,320
Sir Second Tu!

677
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:42,960
Let's go.

678
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,160
Hurry up.

679
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,040
Son!

680
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,120
Mother! Mother!

681
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:53,880
What's wrong with you?

682
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,480
Mother, save me.

683
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,640
Why are you beaten till this state?

684
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,520
I can't endure it anymore!

685
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,960
I can't endure it anymore!

686
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,720
I can't endure it anymore!

687
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,040
I don't know if

688
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,640
older brother is dead or alive.

689
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,320
Oh my god

690
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:05,880
Get up.

691
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,717
Mother, save me!

692
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,559
Mother, save me!

693
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,600
Son.

694
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,760
Mother, save me!

695
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,320
No

696
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,640
Save me!

697
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,640
Son.

698
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,000
You...

699
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,320
What do you really want?!

700
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,280
You've read the testimonies

701
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,280
and the people are all here.

702
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,800
If you still have any questions

703
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,880
you can personally ask these people.

704
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,800
Older brother! Older brother!

705
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,040
You must save me!

706
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,480
Older brother...

707
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:42,960
It was all third little sister

708
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,800
who forced me to do all these!

709
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,800
It was all her!

710
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,080
Older brother...

711
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,480
When did I force you?

712
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,680
If not because you told me

713
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,040
that your mother-in-law was oppressing you

714
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,920
to the point that you couldn't breathe,

715
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,840
that it would be great if she's dead,

716
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,080
would I do all these for you?!

717
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,480
Indeed!

718
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,520
I have always been with Big Madam.

719
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,400
I heard them all.

720
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,040
It's because she pitied her little sister

721
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,000
hence, she risked danger

722
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,920
You all are slandering me!

723
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,200
You...! You...!

724
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,960
What?

725
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,400
You all want to blame all of these

726
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,960
to our house,

727
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,560
is that so?

728
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,400
Really so sorry, brother-in-law.

729
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,400
The ones involved here should have

730
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,560
just been the Kang and Sheng families.

731
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,800
I understand your anger.

732
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,920
But,

733
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,000
don't vent it on our Wang Family.

734
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,160
Our Wang Family

735
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,300
has treated you very well.

736
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,080
Those words are very right.

737
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,080
Before, my official status was just measly

738
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,080
and I'm an illegitimate child.

739
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,160
I also got sent outside of the capital

740
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,040
to a remote and desolated place.

741
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,000
It's all thanks to father-in-law and mother-in-law

742
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,800
for not disliking me for that.

743
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,720
They still treated me fairly

744
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,250
and even married off their legitimate daughter to me.

745
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,160
I've always felt

746
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,600
grateful about it.

747
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,360
But today...

748
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,040
Virtuous son-in-law,

749
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,280
good child,

750
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,320
I never cared about you

751
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,160
being a legitimate or illegitimate child.

752
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,680
I just liked you

753
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,000
for having a gentle and benevolent

754
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,200
personality.

755
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,640
Father,

756
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,360
if you want to truly thank the Wang Family,

757
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,080
then we must clearly resolve this matter.

758
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,960
Save the House of Wang from troubles.

759
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,560
What do you mean?

760
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,520
Just to clear your legitimate mother from this

761
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,160
what nonsense can you not come up with?

762
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,360
Shut up!

763
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,920
Maternal Aunt has been in the capital for many years

764
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,560
and kept instigating gossips about our family.

765
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,880
It's fine if it's only 300 to 500 taels.

766
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,160
Since the House of Wang was rumored

767
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,040
to be moving back to the capital,

768
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,960
those two Steward Qi

769
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,080
started contacting people

770
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,920
who can create poisons.

771
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,960
Old Madam, when you and auntie-in-law returned to the capital

772
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,160
that day when my whole family went to visit you,

773
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,240
Steward Qi paid that Daoist priest

774
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,200
he deposited.

775
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,920
During the first family banquet

776
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,000
of Maternal Uncle's back in the capital,

777
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,920
Maternal Aunt started

778
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,920
to incite our Big Madam

779
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,040
to buy food from Jufang Store.

780
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,440
You...

781
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,960
are determined to use the House of Wang

782
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,040
Are you planning to drag all hundred of people

783
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,680
from our clan to pay for your crime?!

784
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,640
Very good.

785
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,760
Your Wang's is a prestigious aristocratic family.

786
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,360
Our House of Sheng is a nameless poor family.

787
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,440
My mother has been plotted against

788
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,000
and I still have to fear your family,

789
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,000
that I wouldn't dare to publicize

790
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,760
nor investigate this matter anymore.

791
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,920
Brother-in-law,

792
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,480
what fear?

793
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,560
We are one family.

794
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,600
We are just considering each other's dignity,

795
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,200
and afraid of ruining this amicable relationship.

796
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,800
Everyone saw it just now.

797
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,040
People from our manor

798
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,200
were bloodily tormented so horribly.

799
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,440
They surely just made them confess

800
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,360
out of torture!

801
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,560
That's right, older brother.

802
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,440
Their Sheng Family

803
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,920
just want to completely clear little sister out of this.

804
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,000
Completely clear their family out of this.

805
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,680
Hence, they kept falsely accusing me.

806
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,440
You all saw it earlier!

807
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,320
They've captured my trusted aides.

808
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,600
They all got heavily tortured.

809
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,120
Who weren't covered with blood?

810
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,120
How could they not get any confession?

811
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,080
I've guessed Maternal Aunt will say such a thing.

812
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,880
But,

813
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,880
you are also right.

814
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,320
What if those lowly servants

815
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,240
were just falsely accusing you

816
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,600
to get out of their crimes?

817
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,600
Sixth Miss, are you a bit dizzy

818
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,880
for being too angry?

819
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,720
What do you mean?!

820
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,680
Those lowly servants were indeed falsely accusing me.

821
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,160
The critical point in this problem

822
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,480
is still in the fact that

823
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,360
one brush can't write two Wang.

824
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,200
Was it really my house's Big Madam

825
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,040
who harmed my grandmother,

826
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,800
or was it

827
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,720
the Kang's Big Madam.

828
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,840
How come...

829
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,600
Is Sixth Miss the one

830
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,520
in-charge of this house now?

831
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,360
It's not important who's the one in charge.

832
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,520
What's important is to clarify this matter.

833
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,200
That's what going to give us a good omen.

834
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,560
None knows one's daughter more than the mother.

835
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,720
May Old Madam make the decision.

836
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,840
My grandmother is still in critical condition.

837
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,040
This matter should be explained, right?

838
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,120
Father,

839
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:48,840
what do you say?

840
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,552
Trying to kill an elderly relative

841
00:38:51,552 --> 00:38:52,720
is a crime unacceptable to heavenly principles.

842
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,560
Coming to our Sheng Manor

843
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,640
and doing such sinister act on my mother,

844
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
that's bullying others intolerably!

845
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,320
We must clarify this matter no matter what.

846
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,880
Mother-in-law, you must make a judgment.

847
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,920
Mother!

848
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,680
Mother!

849
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,400
Save me!

850
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,200
How much I have suffered these years?

851
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,480
You know it very well.

852
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,680
No one can understand the pain I have

853
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,200
in my heart.

854
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,480
Mother, mother,

855
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,600
you must save me!

856
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,880
Save me, mother!

857
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,360
Mother! Mother!

858
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,040
Mother! Mother!

859
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,040
It was older sister who said that

860
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,080
this medicine would only

861
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,320
make a person sick.

862
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,440
I didn't know that it was a lethal poison.

863
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,000
If I knew,

864
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,800
even I had the guts,

865
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,800
I will never come up with an idea

866
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,880
to harm others like that!

867
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,280
Mother!

868
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,280
Mother... Mother,

869
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,920
Mother, nothing bad will happen to her.

870
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,240
Her son is outstanding.

871
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,640
Her daughter married into a family with high status.

872
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,120
The Sheng Family will not make things difficult for her.

873
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,680
Mother,

874
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,600
but I can't.

875
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,280
I can't.

876
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,560
I really can't.

877
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,400
That Kang husband of mine has no conscience.

878
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,480
He has long disdained me.

879
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,240
Our house is full of vixens.

880
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,480
He wanted me to die.

881
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,280
If I committed a mistake,

882
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,600
I surely will get divorced. Mother!

883
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,520
Mother!

884
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,600
Mother, what about my children?!

885
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,960
Mother!

886
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,960
This marriage was decided

887
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,880
by you and father.

888
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,160
You can't ignore me

889
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,280
and just let others determine my fate. Mother!

890
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,880
Maternal Grandmother,

891
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,720
save my mother!

892
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
It was clearly you!

893
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,720
You're the one who poisoned her!

894
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,720
You're so shameless!

895
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,400
Mother,

896
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,520
you must save me...

897
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,040
Mother!

898
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,360
You were raised in a doting manner.

899
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,280
Your older brother and sister-in-law,

900
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,360
your little sister and her husband

901
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,880
and our other relatives,

902
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,280
if they would not go with your way

903
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,280
by just a bit,

904
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,280
you would then bear grudges.

905
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,440
Just because your father and I

906
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,520
favored you so much,

907
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,120
you became extremely audacious

908
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,920
to have committed a beastly act like this that's not

909
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,520
tolerable by heavenly principles!

910
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:14,920
I...

911
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,080
I can't defend you anymore.

912
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,680
Mother...

913
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,560
Are you

914
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,120
abandoning me?!

915
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,760
It was you and father

916
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,080
who decided on this marriage.

917
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,080
These years, I've lived like in hell!

918
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,240
Now, you are just flinging your arms and not caring?

919
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,080
How can there be a heartless parent

920
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,920
in this world?

921
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,880
You can't do this!

922
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,120
If father is alive

923
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,360
Don't mention your father!

924
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,400
He had served as an official for decades

925
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,680
and died in the line of duty.

926
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,429
Just the thousand people umbrella,

927
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:11,280
he has received 7 or 8 of them.

928
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,720
Look at you.

929
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,520
In everything that you did,

930
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,720
can you really face the soul

931
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,680
of your father in heaven?!

932
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,840
This time,

933
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,880
I can't cover for you anymore.

934
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,000
Or else,

935
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,560
how could I be able to face

936
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,120
the good affection of my in-law?

937
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,920
I thank mother-in-law for giving us justice.

938
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,600
So, it's because of the in-law.

939
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,800
Yes.

940
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,160
I didn't marry to a family as good as little sister.

941
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,160
Her son and son-in-laws are all successful people.

942
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,920
Your son-in-law is also having a splendid career.

943
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,440
I've now sunken into a lowly state.

944
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,800
My husband is also incapable.

945
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,680
I can't blame you for looking down on me.

946
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,240
Now, even my own blood relatives

947
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,000
are stepping on me.

948
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,240
It's better that I just die!

949
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,160
Mother!

950
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,560
Let me die.

951
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:35,640
Miss!

952
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,560
Let me die.

953
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,240
My Big Madam is just out of her mind

954
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,720
for a moment.

955
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,360
Why not just let me,

956
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,560
just let me take her back home to rest for a while,

957
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,960
before bringing her back here?

958
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,200
I'm not going.

959
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,000
Let s go back.

960
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,480
Nanny Qi, you can't go!

961
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,200
Nanny Qi!

962
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,840
We are each serving different masters!

963
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,600
Mother.

964
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,160
Your Big Madam

965
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,440
framed my Big Madam!

966
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,400
You just want to leave like this?!

967
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,280
You can't leave!
