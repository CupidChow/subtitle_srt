00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,750
Episode 71

3
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,030
Stop the carriage!

4
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,270
Young Lord, be careful.

5
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:01,980
Didn't you say that they made some new snow wine?

6
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,840
Let's go.

7
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,110
Let us enter together

8
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,272
and have a taste as husband and wife.

9
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,200
Come.

10
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,840
I'm about to finish my first month postpartum.

11
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,090
I'm holding a first-month-old birthday celebration.

12
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,580
Big Madam.

13
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,960
I'm about to finish my first month postpartum.

14
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,040
I'm holding a first-month-old birthday celebration.

15
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,720
Big Madam, you've suffered some trauma

16
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,980
during your first month postpartum.

17
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,520
Why not have a rest first

18
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,250
and just make it two months?

19
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,480
I'm thinking that

20
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,540
with such a huge problem happening in our house,

21
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,440
how about we don't celebrate the first month,

22
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,550
so as not to attract attention?

23
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,940
Pack everything.

24
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,375
Also process his legs,

25
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,550
understand?

26
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,180
Don't go up anymore.

27
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,660
Lord Qi.

28
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,520
The adjacent house said that

29
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,640
they heard a strong noise

30
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,740
and a loud miserable cry.

31
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,480
He then tried to peek over the wall and saw three men

32
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,450
leaving by jumping over another wall.

33
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,430
In an instant, they were gone.

34
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,470
It's not a suicide, right?

35
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,680
It surely isn't.

36
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,040
According to my many years of experience,

37
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,503
he must have been strangled and then tied up there.

38
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,750
I got it.

39
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,300
Take care, Lord Qi.

40
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:17,320
Eldest Bai is dead. He was murdered.

41
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:19,520
There's no news about

42
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,300
Zhu Manniang.

43
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,760
Such fine net.

44
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,400
Big Madam, Young Lord said that

45
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,175
he won't accompany you to attend

46
00:04:43,175 --> 00:04:44,000
the first-month celebration.

47
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,480
He said for you to just choose a few items

48
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,550
in passing to serve as gifts.

49
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,050
Those can already serve as tokens from him.

50
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,880
When Minglan delivered a child

51
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,680
I told him that I wouldn't go attend her first-month celebration

52
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,420
but he insisted that we go.

53
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:00,520
Now that I've agreed on going, he won't go instead.

54
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,460
I'm unable to convince him.

55
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,800
I'm sure that

56
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,190
only you can convince him.

57
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,210
Where is he?

58
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,840
After Young Lord gave me a reply,

59
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,790
he went out.

60
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,120
Where did he go?

61
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,040
How could Young Lord tell me

62
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,960
about those things?

63
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,390
Those things?

64
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,400
Did he go to a brothel?

65
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,680
Is it Guangyun or Shuixian?

66
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,160
Things like that...

67
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,420
the more I'm ignorant about it.

68
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,620
I'll have him pay when he's back.

69
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,723
Come over here to fix my hair.

70
00:05:46,723 --> 00:05:48,610
You know more hairstyle.

71
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,840
Wife!

72
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,440
Where's the gold necklace

73
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,650
we're gifting the baby?

74
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,530
Didn't I hand it to you already?

75
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,880
How come I can't see it?

76
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,120
Young Lord said you want to look at it earlier.

77
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,040
You must

78
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,890
have casually left it somewhere.

79
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:20,680
That's right.

80
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,620
It was still in my hand earlier.

81
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,880
Quickly help me look for it.

82
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,990
You all also go look.

83
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,880
I told you to keep an item

84
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,880
and you couldn't even do it?

85
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,480
Wife,

86
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,920
with the time you wasted talking,

87
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,090
we'll be able to find three necklaces already.

88
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,440
It was you who misplaced it

89
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,100
and didn't even know where it is.

90
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,120
What have you been

91
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,160
thinking all day?

92
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,280
You're really not giving any importance

93
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,330
to this child's first-month birthday.

94
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,790
Look below the bed.

95
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,890
What's going on?

96
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,890
Father. Mother.

97
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,720
Husband

98
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,800
lost the necklace

99
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,560
we're about to give the Gu baby.

100
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,810
We're looking for it.

101
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,220
Father, mother, please sit down.

102
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,010
I just misplaced it,

103
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,200
and she already kept

104
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,180
nagging me about it.

105
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,450
We're just in time then.

106
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,160
This is a gift

107
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,600
your mother chose for tonight's

108
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,710
first-month birthday celebration.

109
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,760
It's nothing.

110
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,190
Just some white jade locket.

111
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,040
This is part of your dowry.

112
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,920
You two just gift that

113
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,150
on my behalf.

114
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,850
Mother, go with us too.

115
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,390
The household services of Cheng Garden are not bad.

116
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:09,400
Their chef can really cook.

117
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,720
I won't go anymore.

118
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,430
I'm old and unable to endure banquets already.

119
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,940
It's tiring.

120
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,800
You two just go on our behalf.

121
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,080
From now on,

122
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,790
no matter what happens to the Gu couple,

123
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,580
we must maintain frequent contact with them.

124
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,880
After all,

125
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,630
our ancestors are relatives.

126
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,340
I understand.

127
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,600
Mother,

128
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,920
we still haven't found the golden necklace

129
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,570
that we're supposed to give out.

130
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,800
You know husband the most.

131
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,730
Please help me find it.

132
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,600
He's always disorderly.

133
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,430
Always leaving things here and there.

134
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,360
Tuan'er don't cry.

135
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,820
don't cry.

136
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,340
Okay already.

137
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,240
Big Madam,

138
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,560
it's not yet time.

139
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,900
People must be still on their way here.

140
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,880
She knew that people won't be coming.

141
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,240
She just had to put up this big joke.

142
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,340
What nonsense are you saying?

143
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,720
Forget it.

144
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,980
What she said is true.

145
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,230
Sixth Madam of Count of Yongchang Count Manor is here!

146
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,930
Fourth Sister?

147
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,360
Fourth Sister, you're here early.

148
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,160
Sixth Little Sister, your banquet looks nice.

149
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,640
That is arranged by the servants.

150
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,360
I just finished my first month postpartum

151
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,410
so I apologize if I won't be able to entertain you well.

152
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:20,620
I can see that no one is here.

153
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,370
That's quite good.

154
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,460
The dishes have been served.

155
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,640
Just right.

156
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,380
You can rewarm them and eat them for 2 to 3 more meals.

157
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,230
What do you mean by that?

158
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,200
If you're unwilling to eat in the banquet

159
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,800
of our Gu Family

160
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,150
you can leave now.

161
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,240
How come Sixth Little Sister

162
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,190
has lost your composure to this degree?

163
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,640
Even a nursemaid

164
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,150
can attend a banquet and talk now.

165
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,850
Don't you know that

166
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,640
rewarming

167
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,000
food like this

168
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,320
then eating them

169
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,010
is called a house with remnant blessings.

170
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,360
Okay already.

171
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
Fourth Sister,

172
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,960
if you really care for me

173
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,290
then quickly get on your seat.

174
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,040
I knew it.

175
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,760
For a magnanimous person like you,

176
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,880
you will never drive people away

177
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,560
just because you deem your banquet as being precious.

178
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,640
The banquet of Sheng Minglan

179
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,240
has always been precious.

180
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,370
Not everyone can eat them.

181
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,310
Sister Zhang.

182
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:16,730
Don't be afraid.

183
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:19,020
Little Sister Shen, you're here too.

184
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,630
Still want to show off your official power?

185
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,240
Too bad,

186
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,810
the one who is happy now

187
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,920
is Grand Madam Qin

188
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,690
and Old Madam Wang.

189
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,320
That one of yours

190
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,060
who stole, deceived, and forcibly took his marquis title

191
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,820
lost it all.

192
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,680
Drag her out!

193
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,500
Sister!

194
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,600
You...

195
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,490
Duan's family from Xuzhou is here

196
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,350
Yanran is here.

197
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,890
Slow down.

198
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,020
Minglan!

199
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,420
Please go inside.

200
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,440
Go and welcome here. Leave this to me.

201
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,340
Okay.

202
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,550
Sister, don't be mad.

203
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,590
Yanran. Yan…

204
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,280
If you shut up,

205
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,550
you'll still get a bowl to eat here.

206
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,320
If you speak again,

207
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,120
even if His Majesty comes,

208
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,190
I'll still drag you out.

209
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,120
Okay.

210
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,080
I'll wait here then.

211
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,640
I want to see

212
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,320
if His Majesty will come or not.

213
00:12:38,356 --> 00:12:39,419
Minglan!

214
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:40,250
Yanran!

215
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,320
Congratulations! Congratulations!

216
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,980
Minglan.

217
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,120
Madam Zhang, please go inside.

218
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,049
Okay.

219
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,840
I brought you

220
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,120
newly harvested manhong.

221
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,780
Go and get it.

222
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,800
I especially asked my husband

223
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,030
to pick two baskets for you.

224
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,280
No need to open it.

225
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,280
The tea you make is my favorite.

226
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,480
There's one more good item.

227
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,210
Quickly go get it.

228
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:11,940
This...

229
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,680
Look at this.

230
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,610
Do you still remember?

231
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,960
This...

232
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,600
This is... Isn't this

233
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,474
the "All birds looking up to the phoenix"

234
00:13:24,474 --> 00:13:26,500
embroidery I mounted for you?

235
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,840
I feel that

236
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,120
it doesn't suit my stepmother,

237
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,320
hence, I brought it with me

238
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,500
to Xuzhou as my dowry.

239
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,720
I thought of

240
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,700
bringing it here today

241
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,850
to gift you and your child.

242
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:38,140
Look, all birds looking up to the phoenix.

243
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,800
So splendid!

244
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,160
I wish that all great fortune

245
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,400
and that all things will go your way.

246
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,770
Okay.

247
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,800
Let's quickly go in.

248
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,220
Let's go.

249
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,320
So cute.

250
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,760
Just look like Ming’er.

251
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,040
My older sister will surely be happy.

252
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,600
Mistress will surely love him.

253
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,440
Look at those big eyes.

254
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,880
Come, let's quickly put on him

255
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,080
the golden necklace we brought with us.

256
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,020
Come, try it on.

257
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,970
Lift his head up.

258
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:28,280
Oh, so suitable!

259
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,480
Come.

260
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,440
Is he hungry?

261
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,600
Give me the child.

262
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,500
You might get tired carrying him.

263
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,120
Everyone, please enter the banquet.

264
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,040
Quickly enter the banquet.

265
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,360
Miss.

266
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,720
Miss.

267
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,000
Danju?

268
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,280
Miss.

269
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,280
This is my husband.

270
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,080
I brought him to see Young Master.

271
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,720
Quickly get up, the two of you.

272
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,349
It's good that you're here.

273
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,400
You're crying again.

274
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,080
People from Youyang are here!

275
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,840
Please go inside.

276
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,120
Please.

277
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,720
Please go inside.

278
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,720
That's Minglan.

279
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,800
Little Sister.

280
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,880
Nanny Zhang!

281
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,580
Yes!

282
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,000
Tuan'er is exhausted.

283
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,560
Take care of him and let him sleep for a while.

284
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,320
I'll go in front to help Madam entertain the guests.

285
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,160
Just go there later

286
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,640
when Madam sent someone to call you.

287
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,120
Yes. Nanny, don't worry.

288
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,680
Fengxian.

289
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,160
You beast, don't move!

290
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,360
So, what you're saying,

291
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,640
you colluded with Young Lord Qi

292
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,300
and his wife

293
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,920
to deliberately make your house

294
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,440
very busy and chaotic.

295
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,360
The reason you're unable to catch him

296
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:19,360
is because he's in the dark,

297
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,250
while you're in the light.

298
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,010
Why not make your house disorderly?

299
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,320
The more disordered, the better. The more chaotic it is,

300
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,018
the more that person would want to make a move.

301
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,704
If he doesn't want to make a move,

302
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,000
the person behind him will also

303
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,160
force him to do so.

304
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,360
Amitabha.

305
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,680
You people have really scared

306
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,890
Shulan and Pinlan.

307
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,960
Yanran even told me earlier

308
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,200
to advise you to take care of yourself.

309
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,520
Yanran and Shulan surely must

310
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,930
have been traumatized.

311
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,960
With Pinglan's character,

312
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,268
she surely won't.

313
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,640
She probably would be asking for inside scoop.

314
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,720
Inside scoop?

315
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,750
Is there any?

316
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,480
I came today

317
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,000
to bid you farewell.

318
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,080
During dinner,

319
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,220
your sister-in-law Hai

320
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,760
secretly went here

321
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,840
to took away the key

322
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:37,240
for the room where your Second Brother is locked up.

323
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,400
I then have guessed it.

324
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,080
I'm going to wrong

325
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,090
Second Brother soon.

326
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,320
A family will always mutually drag and owe each other.

327
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,600
There's no such thing

328
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,520
as wronging or not.

329
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,840
Get up, Ming'er.

330
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,120
Get up before talking.

331
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,000
I'm old.

332
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,510
I always fear that what if

333
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,360
one day, I'm suddenly gone.

334
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,440
This world

335
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,240
is full of traps and blades.

336
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,160
I'm always worried about you.

337
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,120
Hence, whenever you encounter problems,

338
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,920
I would always

339
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,940
nag you.

340
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,880
I feared that you might haven't learned anything.

341
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,840
Now, really good.

342
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,320
I can see how sure you are with your decision.

343
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,990
You have a backbone and is experienced.

344
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,400
No matter what you encounter in the future,

345
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,200
I can be at ease now.

346
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,000
Grandmother.

347
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,760
Grandmother.

348
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,440
Since he was young, he kept being deceived and framed.

349
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,280
He thought that the hard days were finally over.

350
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,800
With achievements obtained by swords and spears,

351
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,160
he thought

352
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,560
he could get peaceful days in exchange.

353
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,840
Yet others just took them all away.

354
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,000
I feel that injustice has been done to him.

355
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,800
But what do you plan to do?

356
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,600
What can you do?

357
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,000
Tomorrow, I will wear my conferred title formal robe

358
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,600
and seek for justice.

359
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,840
Conferred title?

360
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,960
That title of yours

361
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,360
was gone with that of Marquis'.

362
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,800
Wearing a conferred title formal robe

363
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,080
is against the rules.

364
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,680
Against the rules?

365
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,668
Now that things have become like this,

366
00:22:11,668 --> 00:22:14,080
will I still be afraid of going against the rules?

367
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,480
I know that you've

368
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,030
always been like this.

369
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,960
In usual days, you're tolerant about everything.

370
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,920
But when pushed to a dead end,

371
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,849
you would fight all out

372
00:22:36,849 --> 00:22:38,160
and let everyone just perish with you.

373
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,720
Don't be afraid, Ming'er.

374
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,280
Get up.

375
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,160
I also found you a witness.

376
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,960
Nanny Fang.

377
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,200
Coming.

378
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,000
Cousin,

379
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,280
you saved me from that fiery pit before.

380
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,160
Today, no matter what,

381
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,440
I'm willing to go with you.

382
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,040
So preposterous!

383
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:46,200
Is my imperial court

384
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,720
a place for their families

385
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,640
to settle their lawsuits?

386
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,720
Your Majesty!

387
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,880
But since our dynasty was established,

388
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,400
as long as anyone drums the Dengwen Drum,

389
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,440
the case must be tried.

390
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,960
We mustn't disobey the ancestral rules.

391
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,400
Am I here to try the case

392
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,530
of these families?

393
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,520
What are the Court of Judiciary

394
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,710
and Kaifeng Precinct for?!

395
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,120
Informing Your Maejsty,

396
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,016
Let's not mention the practice

397
00:24:29,016 --> 00:24:30,640
of drumming the Dengwen Drum first.

398
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,200
This case is just a continuation

399
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,640
of the case of Gu Marquis.

400
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,600
Since the case of Gu Marquis

401
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,240
has been tried in the morning court

402
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,520
even if you don't want to try this succeeding case,

403
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,520
you can't clearly cast this case away.

404
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,340
Why do I have to cast it away?

405
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,240
Did I get my throne in an illegal manner?!

406
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,960
Your Majesty, please be cautious with your words.

407
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,960
Prime Minister is right.

408
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,990
I was too rash.

409
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,960
Let's return in discussing the border matters.

410
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,040
Your Majesty!

411
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:07,760
You...

412
00:25:08,113 --> 00:25:09,671
If there is injustice in the world

413
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,340
will Royal Father really just ignore it?

414
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,280
I earnestly ask Your Majesty.

415
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,440
Your Majesty.

416
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,800
Prime Minister Han, please continue.

417
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:42,960
Continue!

418
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,440
Your Majesty.

419
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,110
Grand Master of Remonstrance, go back.

420
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,680
Lord Qi, please.

421
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,680
I'll go and report back to His Majesty now.

422
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,840
Lord, you're on your own.

423
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,000
Eunuch, please wait.

424
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,960
What's going on?

425
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,040
Is His Majesty still not calling them

426
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,210
to the court for interrogation?

427
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,720
How was it?

428
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,600
His Majesty refused to give her an audience.

429
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,200
These children...

430
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,475
Totally muddled and not

431
00:27:02,475 --> 00:27:03,520
thinking about the consequences.

432
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,640
In a moment of agitation and anger,

433
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,960
they just do whatever they want.

434
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,360
Tell me then, what should they do?

435
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,960
It's still a long way

436
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,600
until autumn.

437
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,640
Everyone should just help think.

438
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,480
Combining thoughts is always beneficial.

439
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,660
I'm sure that we'll eventually come up with an idea.

440
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,440
Think then.

441
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,720
Mother, I know.

442
00:27:31,981 --> 00:27:33,100
I know that you're angry at me

443
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,240
for just caring about our own house,

444
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,920
and disregarding my son-in-law.

445
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,360
But have you thought about it?

446
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,840
Son-in-law has the emperor

447
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,800
and Prince Huan

448
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,630
as his backers.

449
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,400
He's just suffering at the moment.

450
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,280
After a period of time,

451
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,160
once this issue has passed

452
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,840
he'll surely be reinstated.

453
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,820
But our family?

454
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,760
We've been cautious and careful until today.

455
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:57,960
Must our family

456
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,080
get destroyed

457
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,300
by that crazy Madam Kang?

458
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,960
You have a point.

459
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,274
I'm saying this

460
00:28:07,274 --> 00:28:09,040
as an old and experienced man.

461
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,440
You go personally

462
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,880
tell this reason

463
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,630
to your son Changbai.

464
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,080
I'll say it then.

465
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,840
Now, just to avoid suspicion with this case,

466
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,520
I've already idled myself inside this house.

467
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,960
If Changbai's future

468
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,860
gets destroyed,

469
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,000
our whole House of Sheng

470
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,500
will be over.

471
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,440
Mother,

472
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,400
Minglan isn't the only member

473
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,650
of our Sheng Family.

474
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,960
There are hundreds of people in Youyang still.

475
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,600
I'll talk to Bai'er now.

476
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,360
Anyone!

477
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,760
Open the door!

478
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,080
Open the door!

479
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,400
I'm a witness!

480
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,800
I'm a witness!

481
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:07,920
Open the door! Open the door!

482
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,280
Why are you shutting your doors and avoiding to face me?

483
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,960
I'm a witness!

484
00:29:12,222 --> 00:29:14,660
Stop shouting!

485
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:15,880
Go home with me!

486
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,470
No!

487
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,720
Changbai,

488
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,640
it's enough for one from our family,

489
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,040
your little sister, filing a complaint.

490
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,320
Quickly go back.

491
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,800
I'm a witness.

492
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,000
I'll seek justice for Sixth.

493
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,680
Men!

494
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,440
Open the door!

495
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,640
I'm here to submit a complaint letter!

496
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,520
I'm a witness!

497
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,120
Men! Open the door!

498
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,320
Go to the palace gates!

499
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,840
I'm a witness!

500
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,560
I'm here to submit my complaint letter!

501
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,440
Just to struggle for power

502
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,200
in my maiden house, Madam Kang

503
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,480
instigated my direct mother to use poison

504
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,880
and almost

505
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,110
killed my grandmother!

506
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,360
I have witnesses and evidence.

507
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,200
May Your Majesty investigate it clearly.

508
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,200
Just to struggle for power in my maiden house, Madam Kang

509
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,240
instigated my direct mother to use poison.

510
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,520
and almost

511
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,200
killed my grandmother!

512
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,000
I have witnesses and evidence.

513
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,760
May Your Majesty wisely investigate it!

514
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,475
Big Madam. What's going on?

515
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,080
She's still

516
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:29,840
outside the palace.

517
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,760
Yes.

518
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,400
What about the rest?

519
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,800
Young Lord Qi and the people from her house

520
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,920
have all been sent away by her.

521
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,160
Now, only she

522
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,840
and her servants are there.

523
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,880
Then it means...

524
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,400
...she has no one by her side now.

525
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,280
None anymore.

526
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,360
I...

527
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,470
You can’t.

528
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,520
It's because we pressured Fengxian too much,

529
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,320
that's why that concubine daughter

530
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,330
was able to set her up and catch her.

531
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,000
Now,

532
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,880
she sent away all her servants.

533
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,240
Maybe, she's just baiting us.

534
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,800
Moreover,

535
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,000
it's right outside the palace.

536
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,280
We mustn't do anything.

537
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:35,600
Just to struggle for power in my maiden house

538
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,400
Madam Kang instigated my direct mother to use poison

539
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,240
and almost

540
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,880
killed my grandmother!

541
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,760
I have witnesses and evidence.

542
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,240
May Your Majesty wisely investigate it!

543
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,560
Just to struggle for power in my maiden house, Madam Kang

544
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,040
instigated my direct mother to use poison

545
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,360
and almost

546
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,960
killed my grandmother!

547
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,720
I have witnesses and evidence.

548
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,200
Gu Tingye was domineering like Huo Guang.

549
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,800
He married a wife that's also domineering!

550
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,600
Since the creation of the world,

551
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,280
which emperor was unable to sleep

552
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,870
from being disturbed by the Dengwen Drum?

553
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,480
Your Majesty, calm your anger.

554
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:14,920
If not because

555
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,190
she just has given birth,

556
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,240
I'll surely have her dragged away

557
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,640
and flogged 20 times!

558
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,600
My husband wholeheartedly

559
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,840
tried to protect me.

560
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,640
Now, he's suffering injustice because of this.

561
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,080
Getting framed by other people.

562
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,680
I...

563
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,720
She's quite a devoted lover.

564
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,760
Too bad, she married the wrong person.

565
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,760
Do you want your brother-in-law

566
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,280
to lead the Jin Imperial Army and drive her away?

567
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,400
Or else, if the emperor listens to it for too long,

568
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,040
he might reconsider the old merits of her husband.

569
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:03,410
By then, it will be problematic if he gets soft.

570
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,920
Her family won't be able to make a comeback.

571
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,440
His Majesty earlier got really mad.

572
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,040
So angry that he so wanted to order someone

573
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,160
to go out and beat her up.

574
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,480
He only gave honor to the Yuzhou generals

575
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,760
hence,

576
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,870
he didn't do it.

577
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,805
Even if I die a hundred times,

578
00:33:19,805 --> 00:33:20,600
I won't be able to make up for this sin!

579
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,840
Officials, please enter the palace hall!

580
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,920
If you want to die,

581
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,470
must you drag your whole family with you?

582
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,960
You all are helping a tyrant here!

583
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,680
Ming'er, my child,

584
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,070
let's go home first.

585
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,360
Let's all just discuss this

586
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,280
and come up with a countermeasure.

587
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,200
Continuing with this is not a good plan.

588
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,600
Okay?

589
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,120
How long have you been drumming?

590
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,120
Let's go back.

591
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,640
That's more like it.

592
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,160
Madam.

593
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,400
Big Madam!

594
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,440
This...

595
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,640
Cousin!

596
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,680
Madam! Madam!

597
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,080
Cousin!

598
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,640
Hurry!

599
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,170
Hurry up!

600
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,440
How come I fell asleep?

601
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,240
Madam Sheng.

602
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,840
You're awake?

603
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,680
Come, get up.

604
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,040
Good thing the palace has 100-year-old ginseng.

605
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,607
I was even afraid that you're too weak

606
00:36:21,607 --> 00:36:22,480
and might not be able to bear its nourishing effect,

607
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,320
so I just sliced a few

608
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,440
and made it into a soup to feed you.

609
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,000
Fortunately, you're awake.

610
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,410
Or else, I don't know how I'll be explaining it

611
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,320
to Zhonghuai.

612
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,840
Your Highness...

613
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,160
I finally have seen you.

614
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,040
My husband

615
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,800
is really innocent!

616
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,680
I...will get you my complaint letter.

617
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,920
Xiaotao! Hand me my complaint letter!

618
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,360
You all leave first.

619
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,360
Yes.

620
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:09,440
Zhonghuai was so domineering.

621
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,160
What?

622
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,040
Can't he endure being battered?

623
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,200
The thunder, rain, or dew are all the emperor's graces.

624
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,520
Others can be demoted and exiled.

625
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,280
What?

626
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,531
Only he must be continuously promoted

627
00:37:23,531 --> 00:37:24,880
and given noble titles?

628
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:45,520
Big madam, look.

629
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,260
She's here.

630
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,480
I told you.

631
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,760
If she's going to return from the palace,

632
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,680
she surely will pass by Fan House.

633
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,680
Ming'er...

634
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,280
Child

635
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,320
what are you doing?

636
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,600
Quickly get back into the carriage.

637
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:03,880
Persuade her.

638
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:16,200
Everyone all said that my marriage

639
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,480
was inferior to hers.

640
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,480
Said that I didn't have a better life than hers.

641
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,800
But what now?

642
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,840
When her family was pleased with success,

643
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,720
they looked down on me.

644
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,040
Now that they've fallen,

645
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,520
of course, people will laugh.

646
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,080
Ming'er...

647
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,440
What's going on?

648
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,640
Minglan.

649
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,760
All the flying birds are gone.

650
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,720
The good bow has been kept away.

651
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,240
The wild rabbit is dead.

652
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,440
The hunting dog is being boiled to be eaten.

653
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,080
Shut up.

654
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,000
My god,

655
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,440
what are you saying?

656
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,920
You can't say such words so casually.

657
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,120
Are you crazy?

658
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,280
Has she gone crazy?

659
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,120
Let's go home.

660
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,160
Madam.

661
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,400
Oh my god.

662
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,240
Madam, stop crying.

663
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,040
Stop being sad.

664
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,720
There surely will be a way.

665
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,263
Let's go.

666
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,120
Let's go.

667
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,760
Minglan. Minglan.

668
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:53,680
Carry her into the carriage.

669
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,040
Carry her into the carriage. Hurry! Hurry!

670
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,240
Madam.

671
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,640
Come, Madam.

672
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,400
Go. Go. Go.

673
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,040
Madam!

674
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,920
Ming'er!

675
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,640
Hurry!

676
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,320
Ming'er!

677
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:08,400
Madam.

678
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,280
Hurry!

679
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:09,920
Hurry up!

680
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,720
Hurry!

681
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,680
Why are you all just standing there?

682
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:12,880
Madam!

683
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,146
Let’s go!

684
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,360
Madam!

685
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,600
What are you looking at?

686
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,090
Let's go back.

687
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,120
How come that Minglan

688
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,760
doesn't have a sense of propriety at all?

689
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,240
She dares to tell everything to outsiders.

690
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,640
Where has her usual sense

691
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,470
of propriety gone to?

692
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,360
I think she must have been

693
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,300
influenced by her husband.

694
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,360
Doesn't know to shut her mouth.

695
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,040
Big Madam.

696
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,790
Young Lord is out.

697
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,600
He has gone out?

698
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:57,960
When he comes back, tell him that

699
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,200
I have something to discuss with him.

700
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,480
Yes.

701
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,880
Big Madam! Big Madam!

702
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,640
Little bitch.

703
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,960
You must be crazy thinking about men!

704
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:19,360
You dare touch my husband too?

705
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,080
I've treated you so well!

706
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,240
You treated me like this?!

707
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,680
When have you been good to me?

708
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,800
The other top maids get 2 to 3 taels every month

709
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,760
while I only get half.

710
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,840
Every 2 to 3 days,

711
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,360
either you whip me or cane me.

712
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,040
When one comes to age,

713
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,400
if one doesn't want to marry,

714
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,680
one willingly stay with her master,

715
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,960
or is arranged to be married,

716
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,800
who doesn't go with the rules?

717
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:46,560
You chose to delay my life

718
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,810
and keep me here.

719
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,080
I just want to

720
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,200
have some warmth!

721
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:54,240
Are you all dead?

722
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,200
Servant!

723
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,520
Big Madam,

724
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,960
it was Young Lord who decided to do this with Qiujiang.

725
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,840
you mustn't be too jealous

726
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,070
and forcing people to their death.

727
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,960
You connived with them to hide it from me?

728
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,800
Husband.

729
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,080
When have I refused

730
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,200
any of your concubine request?

731
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,320
Even your dear Concubine Chunke

732
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,920
I treated her kindly.

733
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,120
Why must you be this ruthless?

734
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,320
This is my close maid attendant.

735
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,640
Why must you

736
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,100
slap my face?

737
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,720
Well, you didn't just slap my face.

738
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,440
What?

739
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,440
Why did you marry me?

740
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:46,720
I love you.

741
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:47,360
Nonsense.

742
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,440
You clearly was jealous of your Sixth Sister

743
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,960
bribed the guard of the Sheng Manor,

744
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:54,695
and then had private meetings

745
00:42:54,695 --> 00:42:56,040
with me in Yuqing Monastery.

746
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,800
All of these were planned by you

747
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,760
and your Mistress mother!

748
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,010
That is not true!

749
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,480
Your mother was also like that.

750
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,520
From a daughter of a criminal official

751
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,740
she was able to enter the House of Sheng.

752
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:11,920
You mustn't talk about my mother

753
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,160
like that!

754
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,640
You and your mother were so sinister.

755
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,960
Drawing a gourd based on a copy.

756
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,360
All words that you told me

757
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,880
were all lies!

758
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,360
It's not like that.

759
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:30,960
Husband.

760
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,560
I have you in my heart.

761
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,600
That year by the side of Jinming Pond,

762
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,760
they were all playing polo.

763
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,840
Only you praised how good my poems were.

764
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,240
You also said my paintings were good.

765
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,520
I just wanted to marry you.

766
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,880
I was afraid that you wouldn't want me!

767
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,840
Husband...

768
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,720
Husband, I'm sincere.

769
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,280
What about the child

770
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,100
in Chunke's womb?

771
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,600
That is because she lacks good fortune.

772
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,400
The child was too large leading to a difficult delivery.

773
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,920
You sent her numerous nourishing food

774
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:12,600
and medicines,

775
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,440
and fed that child to that size!

776
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,040
Was it you?

777
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,080
What nonsense did you tell my husband?!

778
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,120
Husband...

779
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,000
Furong and I,

780
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,400
we both don't want to

781
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,360
continue committing sins for you.

782
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:32,400
Husband

783
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,240
Don't listen to her lies.

784
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,920
What's good with a little bitch like that?

785
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,720
She can slander

786
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,770
and betray me today.

787
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,600
She then can do the same to you in the future.

788
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,200
Husband!

789
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,400
She just didn't want to

790
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,000
marry those farmers or merchants.

791
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,040
She wants your wealth and status!

792
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:48,720
Husband...

793
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,040
Husband,

794
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:51,760
have you forgotten

795
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,880
our past days?

796
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,720
Husband...

797
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:06,880
Husband!

798
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,050
Husband! Sixth!

799
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,680
Sixth, I'm sincere!

800
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,840
From now on

801
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,830
Young Lord will give you a new batch of servants.

802
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,840
Big Madam,

803
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,680
it's better that you return to the main room.

804
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:26,960
How come it's like this?

805
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,720
How come things became like this?

806
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,560
I followed the teachings

807
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:36,360
of my mother.

808
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:37,760
She controlled the Sheng Family

809
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,150
like this.

810
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,160
What part have I done wrong?

811
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,320
No, I wasn't wrong.

812
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,040
I wasn't wrong.

813
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:54,260
It's fine. It's fine.

814
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,560
As long as I properly talk

815
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,920
with my husband tomorrow,

816
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:01,460
he will understand me.

817
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,630
He wouldn't divorce me, right?

818
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,920
Sixth! Sixth!

819
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:12,560
Sixth!

820
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,440
Could it be you still want to

821
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,420
marry that Sheng Minglan?

822
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,440
She's done.

823
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,640
She offended His Majesty

824
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:18,800
and committed a grave crime!

825
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,600
She's done! Sixth!
