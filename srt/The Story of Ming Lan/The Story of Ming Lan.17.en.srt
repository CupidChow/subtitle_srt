00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,008
Episode 17

3
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,960
Can it be that the Old Madam wants the Young Lord

4
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,760
to be her grandson-in-law?

5
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,360
Big Madam, don't think such wild thoughts.

6
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,920
Old Madam is most the lucid.

7
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,667
Her Highness the Princess' ambition

8
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:25,640
is loftier than the sky.

9
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,840
She'd want the Young Lord

10
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,735
to marry a royal princess,

11
00:01:27,735 --> 00:01:28,560
or a second rank princess.

12
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,320
She'd never even look at the Sixth Miss.

13
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,760
That's true.

14
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,600
Big Madam.

15
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,320
Do you want the Qi House as your son-in-law too?

16
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,080
My father is fit to be in the high temple,

17
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,920
and my mother was given a title.

18
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,050
My grandfather was top-third scholar

19
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:52,720
in Hanlin Academy.

20
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,760
My mother-in-law is the sole heiress of a marquis house.

21
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,316
My husband is an esteemed minister

22
00:01:57,316 --> 00:01:58,280
in the Imperial court,

23
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,918
and my son Changbai

24
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:00,080
passed the Imperial exam at first try.

25
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,254
And now he's engaged with

26
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:02,200
Hai Family for his marriage.

27
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,280
Our family is decorated for generations

28
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,520
an honest and noble house.

29
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,680
Hua'er was able to

30
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,120
marry into a count's manor.

31
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,600
And Rulan is also a legitimate heiress.

32
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,840
I imagine the Qi House isn't out of reach.

33
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,080
Big Madam, your intention is good.

34
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,520
But I saw from the side

35
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,080
that our Miss isn't too interested

36
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,280
in the Young Lord.

37
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,680
That's impossible.

38
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,720
Ru'er is always chatting nonstop

39
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,360
about the Young Lord

40
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,160
after coming back

41
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,280
from the study hall.

42
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,440
Think about it in more details, Big Madam.

43
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,200
These matters that the Miss spoke of.

44
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,840
How many were about the Young Lord,

45
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,200
and how many were about the Fourth Miss?

46
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,840
You mean?

47
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,480
Fifth Miss wants the Young Lord

48
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,680
all out of spite for the Fourth Miss.

49
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,040
She's not actually

50
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,680
interested in the Young Lord.

51
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,880
She just can't stand

52
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,560
those witches in Linqi Pavilion.

53
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,320
Today,

54
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,040
the Young Lord played ball with the Sixth miss.

55
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,800
Our Miss didn't get jealous at all.

56
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,280
She only wanted to see

57
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,080
if the match angered the Fourth Miss.

58
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,000
She's still not grown up yet

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,320
and she can't think about her life.

60
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,120
In this capital of Bianjing,

61
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,520
so many wealthy noble houses.

62
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,560
Mother-in-laws, sister-in-laws, various aunts.

63
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,120
All fierce.

64
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,920
Miss Hualan is so smart

65
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,280
yet she has to suffer still.

66
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,480
If our Miss really

67
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,960
matched with the Young Lord

68
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,080
with a Princess as her mother-in-law,

69
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,160
bickering and fighting all day long.

70
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,720
Even if the Young Lord dotes on her,

71
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,240
in the end it will be worn out.

72
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,080
Big Madam,

73
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,600
haven't you seen enough of that?

74
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,400
My daughter's temper is like mine.

75
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,880
Me, at Sheng House too.

76
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,640
I'll have to reconsider from start.

77
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,800
The most urgent matter now

78
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,280
is for you to get Young Master Bai's wedding done

79
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,880
grand and proper.

80
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,880
Hai House is an honest and noble house.

81
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,400
We are getting their daughter.

82
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,320
We cannot let anyone find fault in us.

83
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,480
That's right.

84
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,520
It's a relief that the house management duty

85
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,600
went to the Sixth Daughter.

86
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,480
I'll only mind this wedding

87
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,400
and that's lighter on me.

88
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,120
As for

89
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,920
Sixth Miss showing herself on the ball match matter,

90
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,120
you needn't be mindful of it.

91
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,480
Do you think the Fourth Miss

92
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,120
will just keep quiet on it?

93
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,320
Those offensive and begrudging conducts?

94
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,840
Let those in Linqi Pavilion take those on then.

95
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,680
What's going on?

96
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,520
Fifth Miss, we've arrived at Yuqing Monastery.

97
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,080
We get to eat temple food.

98
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,120
Let's go.

99
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,880
Go.

100
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,400
Mother. I am living very well.

101
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,680
Father treats me very well too.

102
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,640
He teaches me to write.

103
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,440
And my writing

104
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,640
has improved now.

105
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,160
Don't worry, Mother.

106
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,200
You little liar.

107
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,400
Young Lord?

108
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,840
Where's Xiaotao?

109
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,240
Xiaotao? Xiaotao?

110
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,400
I had a junior monk

111
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,840
tell Xiaotao

112
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,040
that your carriage is out of alignment.

113
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,000
She rushed to go take a look.

114
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,729
You can be a little liar.

115
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,600
So can I...

116
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,440
Young Lord, what is this you're doing?

117
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,200
Hurry and go out.

118
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,240
A man and a woman, alone in a dim room.

119
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,440
Are you trying to ruin my chaste reputation?

120
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,800
You...

121
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,920
Do you not

122
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,880
have anything to say to me?

123
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,320
I don't.

124
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,760
Young Lord,

125
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,920
you ought to respect yourself.

126
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,320
If you have nothing to say,

127
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,840
then why did you gift me a pair of knee pads

128
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,040
for the chill of the exam court?

129
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,280
You are good to me,

130
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,200
and I know it.

131
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,640
Then you acknowledge at last,

132
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,760
you did gift me the knee pads?

133
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,560
Young Lord,

134
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,200
that's out of gratitude

135
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,200
and to reciprocate a gift.

136
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,360
You did gift them to me!

137
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,000
And you embroidered

138
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
a "yuanbao" on it.

139
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,520
What's wrong with "yuanbao"?

140
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,680
My name is Yuanruo.

141
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,560
You embroidered "yuanbao".

142
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,280
That's because...

143
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,121
I was afraid

144
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:07,160
there would be such a crowd in the exam yard,

145
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,014
and if you happened to lose it,

146
00:07:09,014 --> 00:07:09,640
it's easier to find it.

147
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,000
If it's for the ease of finding it,

148
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,960
why did you embroider it inside

149
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,760
where you can't see it?

150
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,680
I fear nothing.

151
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,440
I only fear you don't have me in your heart.

152
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,880
You! Stop talking!

153
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,040
I just want to see you.

154
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,800
Help you. Protect you.

155
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,880
But why,

156
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,160
each time you see me,

157
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,880
you avoid me like I'm a snake?

158
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,160
Young Lord, you are a man,

159
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,959
and you don't understand

160
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:48,920
the hardship of being a woman.

161
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,560
We are not like men.

162
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,640
Who can afford it.

163
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,400
Our reputation is easily ruined.

164
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,760
W, What?

165
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,560
For example,

166
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,120
Second Uncle Gu of Marquis of Ningyuan.

167
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,694
He's young and a rogue

168
00:08:10,694 --> 00:08:11,800
who pays no heed to proper duties.

169
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,762
His relationship with his father

170
00:08:13,762 --> 00:08:14,720
is on the brink of collapse.

171
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,320
In the city of Bianjing,

172
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,880
who doesn't know of it?

173
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,480
However if one day,

174
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,157
the prodigal son changes his ways,

175
00:08:21,157 --> 00:08:22,520
passes the exam and progresses upward,

176
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,960
he can still command an army, join the cabinet,

177
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,530
grant his woman a title,

178
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,600
and make his son an heir to his title. Right?

179
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,280
Yes.

180
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,040
But if it's a woman,

181
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,400
can she do that?

182
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,840
You and I are alone in a dim room now.

183
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,120
If this gets out,

184
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,040
and is talked about by crowd,

185
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,360
one spit from each

186
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,320
and that's enough to drown me to death!

187
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,364
My Eldest Sister would never be able to

188
00:08:49,364 --> 00:08:50,360
raise her head

189
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,560
in her mother-in-law's home again.

190
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,160
And my Fourth and Fifth sisters

191
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,120
won't be given marital matches.

192
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,706
It's possible that

193
00:08:58,706 --> 00:09:00,120
my father and brothers might be reprimanded

194
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,560
by the Imperial censor.

195
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,200
Lack of family teaching,

196
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,200
cutting off of the future.

197
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,800
But what about you, Young Lord?

198
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,240
You'll at best

199
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,880
be regarded as passionate.

200
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,960
Same matter,

201
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,600
but the prices to be paid are so drastically apart.

202
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,640
This price? I can't afford it.

203
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,480
I will never

204
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,800
treat you that way.

205
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,240
I swear.

206
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,080
I swear to your

207
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,280
mother's ancestral tablet.

208
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,760
If today's incident is spread,

209
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,960
I will report to my parents immediately

210
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,080
to bring you into our family.

211
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,160
That can stuff the mouths of the crowd.

212
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,701
A woman is like a poor family

213
00:09:50,701 --> 00:09:51,440
in the country village.

214
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,840
Just one handful of rice

215
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,560
and one grain lost is fatal.

216
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,360
But you men are

217
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,880
like wealthy grand houses.

218
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,480
Even a hundred silver

219
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,400
you can afford it.

220
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,360
Now,

221
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,200
I just want to live out my life in peace and safety.

222
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,480
Complete my mother's wish.

223
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,040
From now on,

224
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,800
do not seek me out.

225
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,080
And even if you run into me, don't talk to me.

226
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,000
If you must talk,

227
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,920
then have my Second Brother deliver the words.

228
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,560
I can't bring you to my home?

229
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,960
Her Highness the Princess.

230
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,680
She regards you as precious as pearls.

231
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,360
In the future. In the future...

232
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,894
She'll match you to an Imperial princess,

233
00:10:47,894 --> 00:10:49,160
or a second or third-rank princess.

234
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,420
I'm just a concubine-born daughter

235
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,240
of a fifth-ranking minister.

236
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,680
If you mention it,

237
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,680
that's to my harm.

238
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,160
I don't believe these words of yours.

239
00:11:04,049 --> 00:11:05,480
You're used to lying to me.

240
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,520
You're the only one I want in this lifetime.

241
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,040
I once swore in front of my mother...

242
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,040
that I'd rather be the wife of a farmer

243
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,200
than the concubine of a lord.

244
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,120
Young Lord,

245
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,080
you had better forget this idea now.

246
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,760
Who want you to be a concubine?

247
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,880
I want to marry you

248
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,400
as my legal wife.

249
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,280
What?

250
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,240
I will definitely persuade my mother

251
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,600
to go to your house and propose marriage.

252
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,160
List you on the genealogy and in the clan shrine.

253
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Three letters and six gifts. A grand carriage.

254
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,520
Proper wife?

255
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,320
That's impossible. Completely impossible.

256
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,360
Why is it impossible?

257
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,640
You. Look at today's match.

258
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,840
The entire capital. Who'd believe

259
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,600
we could beat

260
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,600
Second Uncle Gu?

261
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,640
But in the end,

262
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,560
didn't we win still?

263
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,320
I don't wish to deceive myself.

264
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,240
I don't wish you to deceive yourself either.

265
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,080
Even if I am deceiving myself,

266
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,280
what's that to you?

267
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,720
Why don't you like it?

268
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,600
Because you have me in your heart.

269
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,320
You are just afraid,

270
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,960
you're a liar.

271
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,400
Miss.

272
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,200
If you become a duchess,

273
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,280
then Fourth and Fifth Miss

274
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,040
will never

275
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,640
boss you around.

276
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,520
Be quiet.

277
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,390
Miss. Actually,

278
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,320
the Young Lord has such good appearance and character.

279
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,200
Can't be that

280
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,240
you really don't have him in your heart?

281
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,200
He is a branch that is just too high.

282
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,920
It's not someone like me

283
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,200
can afford to climb to.

284
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
To hold hope for something

285
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,040
that's not meant for you,

286
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,320
the one who ends up suffering is only you.

287
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,760
You stood up for Miss Yu

288
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,880
so fiercely to

289
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,920
claim the hairpin.

290
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,440
But when it's your own turn, why do you...

291
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,800
My mother's reminder

292
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,840
for us before her death.

293
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,960
Did you forget it all?

294
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,600
I didn't forget.

295
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,080
If you ever

296
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,040
get yourself tricked away

297
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,000
so easily again

298
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,480
I will not let you

299
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,360
serve in my house.

300
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,640
I'll stand wherever

301
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,200
you tell me to and never move,

302
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,560
even if a knife is beckoning to me!

303
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,760
Sixth Daughter really said that?

304
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,280
Now the entire Bianjing City knows

305
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,000
the Young Lord helped her

306
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
with that polo match.

307
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,960
That girl is beyond glee.

308
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,960
Who asked you about that?

309
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,640
I'm asking.

310
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,960
Did she really say

311
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,200
she was sentimental about her deceased mother?

312
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,400
She did. So what?

313
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,080
Mother. What's wrong?

314
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,840
Now, the badge and keys

315
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,040
are in Sixth Girl's hands.

316
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,976
If we want her to surrender them,

317
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,680
it will be best for her

318
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,680
to make more mistakes.

319
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,480
That girl

320
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,800
shouldn't be let out of the house.

321
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,720
We should find a rope and keep her home.

322
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,680
Mother, when I marry the Young Lord,

323
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,680
the badge and

324
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,880
keys of this house

325
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,760
will be ours forever.

326
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,320
That's true.

327
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,520
Hence,

328
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,280
tonight when your father comes,

329
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,000
you tell him

330
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,200
all you saw and heard by Jinming Pond.

331
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,760
Yes.

332
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,120
We'll see what he does,

333
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,200
and we'll make our move.

334
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,080
Alright.

335
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,760
Clenching your father

336
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,600
is clenching them all.

337
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,520
That Wang Ruofu can

338
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,400
never get that right.

339
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,720
Mother, looser.

340
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,640
By the way, if that Sixth Girl,

341
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,560
ever speaks about missing her late mother again,

342
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,520
you have to remember

343
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,320
to tell me for sure.

344
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,000
I got it. Hurry.

345
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,920
No, that side.

346
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,920
Thirty bolts of satin.

347
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,040
Did you record it?

348
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,360
Yes.

349
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,680
You clumsy-looking thing!

350
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,360
If you ruin these clothes,

351
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,160
you can't afford it

352
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:00,920
with half your yearly salary!

353
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,240
I didn't mean to.

354
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,000
You ruined the clothes.

355
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,200
What's going on outside?

356
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,920
They're having a chicken and dog fight again.

357
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,640
Since they came in,

358
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,840
we've never had any serenity.

359
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,400
Even if we kill you, you can't afford it.

360
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,600
This is the Miss' clothing

361
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,560
and not yours!

362
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,320
I've worked for the Miss for years,

363
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,320
and she's never scolded me,

364
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,240
but you scold me now?

365
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,600
I am a close-quarter maidservant.

366
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,640
If I scold you, you have to listen.

367
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,080
Are you the boss of this courtyard,

368
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,240
or is the Miss the boss?

369
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,455
I can't be Miss' boss,

370
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,720
but I can't be your boss?

371
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,160
I will have the supervising nanny

372
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,120
chase you out tomorrow.

373
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,200
Mucang Pagoda

374
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,640
is the Miss' courtyard.

375
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,080
You want to chase me out?

376
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,720
You can't!

377
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,520
It's nearly nightfall. What's this ruckus?

378
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,760
Miss,

379
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,080
I am clumsy and made the lapel badly.

380
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,280
If you wish to beat me or scold me or chase me out,

381
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,200
I am content.

382
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,560
But I can't

383
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,640
let this outsider oppress us.

384
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,720
Lord of heaven!

385
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,040
You ruined the clothes yourself.

386
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,640
I am a close-quarter maidservant scolding you,

387
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,840
who are just a chore maid.

388
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,200
That's considered oppressing?

389
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,080
What a pitiful thing.

390
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,400
It's just a piece of clothing.

391
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,720
It's not worth it.

392
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,040
Take it back and fix it, and that'll do.

393
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,760
Miss is so merciful.

394
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,040
If it were me,

395
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,000
such a precious satin getting ruined,

396
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,640
deserves to have you beaten and chased out.

397
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,400
Sixth Miss,

398
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,400
with all the talking back and forth,

399
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,440
we don't know

400
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,200
who to listen to.

401
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,360
Alright. Miss Jiu'er is

402
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,240
from Big Madam's room.

403
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,320
At least,

404
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,440
on Big Madam's account,

405
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,280
you need to give

406
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,640
Miss Jiu'er some respect.

407
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:27,720
Let's go.

408
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,520
My mother is

409
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,480
Big Madam's chief maidservant,

410
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,800
If she were in my mother's hands,

411
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,880
she'd be chased out and beaten by now.

412
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,040
Master.

413
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,720
Greetings, Father.

414
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,760
Great deed you committed!

415
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,120
Your grandmother taught you horseback riding

416
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,680
It's for you to go

417
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,880
and show yourself off like that?

418
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,640
Other people's families

419
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,880
are with their brothers.

420
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,680
But only you are so capable

421
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,880
and you are with the Young Lord.

422
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:22,920
Is Qi Yuanruo someone our family

423
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,120
can overreach to,

424
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,280
and you must

425
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,400
shame me like this?

426
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,320
I know my mistake.

427
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,320
So many high ministers and nobles

428
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,040
watching the polo match.

429
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,440
You don't care about your own reputation,

430
00:18:43,114 --> 00:18:44,200
but you need to leave

431
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,680
some honor for Sheng House and me.

432
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,320
I go to the Imperial court,

433
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,560
and people say my Sheng House is a family of scholar

434
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,560
of an honest and noble clan

435
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,840
that gave birth to a daughter

436
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,280
who's usurping and overreaching

437
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,360
to a lofty house?

438
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,600
And what do I have left to go to the court,

439
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,800
and be in His Majesty's attendance?

440
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,640
I never intended to overreach to the Qi House.

441
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,680
It's just that

442
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,946
the prize of the match was

443
00:19:03,946 --> 00:19:05,320
Sister Yu's late mother's item.

444
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,655
And Yu family's Eldest Daughter

445
00:19:07,655 --> 00:19:08,600
laments her lost mother

446
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,555
and can't bear seeing

447
00:19:09,555 --> 00:19:10,480
the item floating outside.

448
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,360
She begged the Third Sister Yu

449
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,280
to help but failed.

450
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,320
So I thought of

451
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,880
my own late mother.

452
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,280
And it was Third Brother

453
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,160
who ditched me and ran first,

454
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,689
so that at last the Young Lord

455
00:19:24,689 --> 00:19:25,680
had no choice but to help me.

456
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,920
So then you make it sound like

457
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,640
it's your Third Brother's fault?

458
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,120
He did it for our Sheng reputation,

459
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,600
and didn't want to embarrass us along with you!

460
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,920
You lack accessories?

461
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,280
Do you lack accessories then?

462
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,600
Or does that Miss Yu

463
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,040
lacks accessories?

464
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,480
You must go and snatch and fight,

465
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,280
and show yourself as overreaching to Qi House?

466
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,120
Father, may you be sage.

467
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,360
I am grown now,

468
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,320
but in my dreams,

469
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,640
I still think of my mother.

470
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,720
I, your daughter, really felt empathetic

471
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,400
for the same pain as Sister Yu's

472
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,360
and that's why I helped her.

473
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,520
Father, nowadays, at times,

474
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,200
do you still think of my mother?

475
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,240
Do you remember what she looked like...

476
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,000
Enough!

477
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,640
Shameful!

478
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,120
I see you still don't recognize your error!

479
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,880
Then you'll kneel here for me!

480
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,440
Really?

481
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,400
You plan to ask to marry

482
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,800
Imperial Tutor Yu's eldest granddaughter?

483
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,120
Since I plan to set up my house

484
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:48,960
and establish on my own.

485
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,120
I need to have a family first.

486
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,160
Coming out solely

487
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,160
will be considered as being against filial piety

488
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,120
and will be sued.

489
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,720
Hence,

490
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,760
I need to get myself a proper main wife first.

491
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,440
Thanks to

492
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,200
Divine God's providence.

493
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,400
Our Young Master is finally

494
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,160
establishing his own house and legacy

495
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,800
to flourish in heirs and family!

496
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,400
Nanny, I hear

497
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,400
this Eldest Miss Yu is very well taught,

498
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,080
elegant and graceful. Educated and reasonable.

499
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,440
Even to the miscellaneous houses

500
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,760
off the street,

501
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,040
she is gracious and cordial.

502
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,200
That's to be sure.

503
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,120
Grand Imperial Tutor

504
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,360
is an honest and noble house.

505
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,480
The eldest legitimate granddaughter?

506
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,000
Her temperament is so amiable.

507
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,800
Surely she will make allowance for Manniang,

508
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,640
and give her a title.

509
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,200
Hearing you say that,

510
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,360
it's for her that you seek Miss Yu?

511
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,360
No daughter about to be the wife

512
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,320
wants to hear that.

513
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:53,960
You must not

514
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,480
speak such absurdity in the future.

515
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,720
This Miss Yu lost her mother

516
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,920
in childhood too.

517
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,600
I saw her personally at the polo match.

518
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,320
For her deceased mother's item,

519
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,320
she wagered her life.

520
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,800
We are kindred souls of the same suffering.

521
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,920
I must satisfy the Yu House.

522
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,880
If I can really get this marriage realized,

523
00:22:13,926 --> 00:22:15,080
I will treat her well

524
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,400
and spare her from

525
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,880
being bullied by her step-mother.

526
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,160
Nanny,

527
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,600
these things that you wanted me to wash

528
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,360
are clean now.

529
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,720
Please check.

530
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,360
Clean or not,

531
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,640
you can't tell,

532
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,800
and you need me to check?

533
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,360
I need you to check,

534
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,920
so I can feel assured to put them away.

535
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,120
If we don't have enough help in the house,

536
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,160
I will go

537
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,800
buy a few more servants and maids then.

538
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,480
This is for her sake.

539
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,000
Later on when you marry

540
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,880
a proper main wife,

541
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,600
she will need to go,

542
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,040
and greet her daily and serve her.

543
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,000
So doing more chores now,

544
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,560
will prepare her well

545
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,960
before the main wife arrives later on.

546
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,920
You're right.

547
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,200
I am of low birth

548
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,600
and I don't dare to aspire.

549
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,591
In the future,

550
00:23:06,591 --> 00:23:08,160
when Madam Yu is married into the family,

551
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,600
I will surely serve,

552
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,040
serve the Big Madam and the Young Master well.

553
00:23:12,815 --> 00:23:15,040
Don't say "Madam Yu" so easily.

554
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,920
I haven't succeeded in

555
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,880
begging for betrothal yet.

556
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,520
If you say that you will ruin her good reputation,

557
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,560
so be prudent.

558
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,000
Yes, Young Master is more considerate.

559
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,800
You are already thinking for the Yu House.

560
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,160
I'm sure the matter of seeking betrothal

561
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,480
will succeed.

562
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,616
I will just be on standby

563
00:23:31,616 --> 00:23:32,880
to serve the Big Madam then.

564
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,240
Nanny, what are you looking at?

565
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,640
Put away the clothes

566
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,680
and check on the children.

567
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,520
You rest up, Young Master.

568
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,840
When the meal is prepared,

569
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,000
I will come to get you.

570
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,120
Why can't you hold your tongue?

571
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,240
A betrothal matter isn't

572
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,600
for you to discuss with her!

573
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,800
Nanny, she's my pillow mate.

574
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,560
This is an inner court matter after all.

575
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,680
I need to at least let her know.

576
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,786
In the future,

577
00:24:28,786 --> 00:24:30,800
your matters with matchmaker or betrothal

578
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,680
do not tell her a thing about it.

579
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,960
You shouldn't have kept her.

580
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,760
She thinks

581
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,440
she's a main wife.

582
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,520
In the future when you really marry,

583
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,520
she will be submissive.

584
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,760
Disarray in the inner court

585
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,000
will affect your future.

586
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,200
My path to the Imperial exam is cut short already,

587
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,800
so what future?

588
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,360
I'll just haphazardly live out

589
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,880
this life instead!

590
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,880
Take the ball.

591
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,480
Chief Wei said

592
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,880
this Miss Yu

593
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,120
was so gentle and kind.

594
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,880
When she went to see her,

595
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,520
she was chased out by the nanny.

596
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,640
But Miss Yu took the step

597
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,600
and called her back.

598
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,480
Think about it.

599
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,920
She's not even sneering at Chief Wei,

600
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,960
so she won't dislike you either.

601
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,320
She will give you a status.

602
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,520
Is she really that good?

603
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,600
It sounds like a dream.

604
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,520
Darling,

605
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,120
you won't

606
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,400
abandon me in the future, right?

607
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,120
I am like her.

608
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,436
We are both motherless.

609
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,040
We are companions of the same misery.

610
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,840
I will

611
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,840
live this life out well with her.

612
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,520
A human heart is made of flesh.

613
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,360
If you treat her well,

614
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,560
she will treat you well too.

615
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,960
Since they came in,

616
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,520
this courtyard hasn't had any peace!

617
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,400
Not just me, but they too.

618
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,600
Scolded so harshly

619
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,800
for nothing!

620
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,200
If you are idle about it, Miss,

621
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,480
this courtyard

622
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,520
will have no survivors left!

623
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,360
It's true.

624
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,320
Please manage this, Miss.

625
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,680
You all do your own duties

626
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,280
well,

627
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,400
and don't mind about others.

628
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,200
If they really want to scold,

629
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,400
it's deserved.

630
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,880
Just don't talk

631
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,400
about outsiders or insiders.

632
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,120
Harmony is more noble than anything.

633
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,360
They are from Big Madam

634
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,640
and Mistress Lin's courtyards.

635
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,040
We need to

636
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,840
pay respect to them.

637
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,200
We can't let the gossipers outside

638
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,600
say our Miss is disrespectful

639
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,480
and pays no heed to seniority.

640
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,440
Fine now. You all go to bed early.

641
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,240
Sister Cuiwei, look!

642
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,680
They are all spies.

643
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,560
This courtyard is a sieve.

644
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,400
Did you forget what I just said to you?

645
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,480
Sister Cuiwei,

646
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:18,480
how much longer

647
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,120
does Miss have to kneel?

648
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,600
Master is too much.

649
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,560
To have no consideration for you

650
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,880
in front of all your servants,

651
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,680
scolding you.

652
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,720
Shaming you so much.

653
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,680
How does he expect

654
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,200
you can be the master of the yard then?

655
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,240
The manager of the entire Sheng House?

656
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,840
It's alright.

657
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,160
But your yard is a sieve.

658
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,920
Yesterday at dawn,

659
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,120
Master came and made a scene.

660
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,680
A few minutes later

661
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,880
and both Big Madam and Mistress Lin already knew.

662
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,560
Old Madam

663
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,720
was actually the last to know.

664
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,200
And you didn't at least

665
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,160
tell Miss Cuiwei to come tell us.

666
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,840
Imagine how sad Old Madam is.

667
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,720
Grandmother dotes on me,

668
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:44,760
but now

669
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,440
I'm the manager of the house.

670
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,520
I can't just go tattle to Grandmother

671
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,720
every couple of days,

672
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,240
it will just show that I'm weak.

673
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,240
Also

674
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,840
Grandmother

675
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,000
can't always help me in everything.

676
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,600
She's not just my grandmother,

677
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,880
after all.

678
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,000
Just as long as you have a plan.

679
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,960
I do. I have a plan.

680
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,200
Such a great tea cup.

681
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,640
It was difficult to get from Jianyang.

682
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,960
Be more careful next time

683
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,040
or tell me to do it.

684
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,760
Just a couple of tea cups.

685
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,466
I've broken so many things

686
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,546
in Third Young Master's room,

687
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,840
and he's never scolded me even half a scolding.

688
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,450
Everyone says the Miss in this courtyard

689
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:24,000
is well-tempered.

690
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,960
Who knew that the Miss is nice,

691
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,440
but you're a busybody.

692
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,440
You are scolding me first?

693
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,120
Last month,

694
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,120
you broke a brush tub.

695
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:32,998
A few days ago,

696
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,800
you broke Miss's favorite

697
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,400
beautiful kite whiledusting.

698
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,560
This Jianyang jade tea set

699
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,920
was sent by the old mansion in Youyang.

700
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,026
It's part of a twelve-piece set

701
00:29:40,026 --> 00:29:40,800
with tea roller and brush,

702
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,560
and with your throwing that,

703
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,000
this set is ruined, do you know?

704
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:51,040
Xiaotao, it's just a few tea cups

705
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,240
and it's nothing urgent.

706
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,520
Don't scold her.

707
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,480
Just clean up.

708
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,640
In this courtyard,

709
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,240
can we serve such a diva?

710
00:29:59,080 --> 00:29:59,840
You!

711
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,400
Why do you shame me like that?

712
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,360
Miss Mei'er is sent here

713
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,480
by Third Brother.

714
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,520
She's Third Brother's prestige.

715
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,440
Go pacify her

716
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,400
and say sorry.

717
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,440
I won't go.

718
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,760
Go now.

719
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,960
You have a plan,

720
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,160
so I will not worry.

721
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,400
Darling Hong, you shouldn't go

722
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,640
and scold the Sixth Miss in her yard.

723
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,680
It's stripping her pride

724
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,160
and her authority.

725
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,360
How is she supposed to deal with her servants now?

726
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,240
Every time I say a few words to her,

727
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,520
you help her case.

728
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,960
You are a concubine mother

729
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,560
and you'll just spoil her.

730
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,840
Sixth Miss was just anxious.

731
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,720
She's not mixed a few words

732
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,920
with the Young Lord before,

733
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,600
but out of panic, she got in a pair with him.

734
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,360
Our Mo'er is different though.

735
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,480
Young Lord is

736
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,680
quite good to her.

737
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,160
When they used to read together,

738
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,000
the two liked to

739
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,240
discuss poetry together.

740
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,600
What do you mean?

741
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,920
Darling Hong,

742
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,680
think for our Mo'er.

743
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,080
If she can, with Qi House. . .

744
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,040
Lord of heaven!

745
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,160
What a big manner you speak with.

746
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,542
You're trying to talk marriage

747
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,662
with the Young Lord of the Duke Qi House?

748
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,080
You're startling me.

749
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,760
You're startling me!

750
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,720
What nerves you have.

751
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,600
You didn't think

752
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,800
what house this Qi is?

753
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,760
The father is top-ranking for one,

754
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,120
a duke by honor,

755
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,160
and the mother is from Dowager Empress Chai!

756
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,320
She was raised in the palace

757
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,680
She's given the title of second-rank princess,

758
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,440
and the two of them

759
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,720
only have this one son.

760
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,960
The ducal title is his for sure.

761
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,120
It's true.

762
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,320
So if our Mo'er can marry him,

763
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,920
that's great for you.

764
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,720
Stop talking, please.

765
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,480
That Young Lord Qi,

766
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,840
if he were a womanizing rogue,

767
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,670
then this matter might have a ray of hope.

768
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,360
But he's a giant among men

769
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,250
and a good child

770
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,720
who studies and strives to seek progress.

771
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,080
That second-rank Princess

772
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,200
regards him like a pearl.

773
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,600
A princess is worthy of him.

774
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,760
Stop having any ideas.

775
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,880
If this leaks out, it's embarrassing.

776
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,840
After all, he's studied here.

777
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,320
There would be some friendship.

778
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,480
What if we attach more dowry,

779
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,680
just like for the Eldest Miss?

780
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,840
Five kilometers of splendid adornment.

781
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,560
Will you be able to fork out that?

782
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,000
I, your servant

783
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,240
I only have some small assets

784
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,800
and living expenses from you.

785
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,640
Naturally, this won't do.

786
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,440
But when Big Madam married into the family,

787
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,440
her dowry is also

788
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,120
for the use of the Sheng family.

789
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,120
Only unremarkable men in this kingdom

790
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,360
will think of having this idea

791
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,520
of touching a woman's dowry.

792
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,000
Look at Big Madam's brother-in-law,

793
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,440
that Lord Kang.

794
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,880
Because he touched the

795
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,960
dowry of the Wang family,

796
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,440
until now,

797
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,280
in front of the Wang family,

798
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,480
he has never been able to lift up his head.

799
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,920
Do you want me to be in the same position?

800
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,200
Darling Hong,

801
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,000
think of a solution.

802
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,280
We can't

803
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,880
delay Molan's marriage.

804
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,080
Yes, I will look out

805
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,360
for Molan's marriage.

806
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,557
You should think about this

807
00:34:16,557 --> 00:34:17,640
in the following days too.

808
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,240
Did Father really say that?

809
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,880
Father really...

810
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,880
For the rest of my life,

811
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,640
am I only worthy of marrying a scholar?

812
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,120
Don't listen to your father.

813
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,440
He's only a man.

814
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,360
How can he know

815
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,240
how to talk indirectly?

816
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,320
If we talk about birthright, of course,

817
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,920
we can't be as good as the main households

818
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,400
but if we talk about beauty and writing,

819
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,320
you are a hundred times better than they are.

820
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,720
Everyone has the same father.

821
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,640
On what account

822
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,160
does your status have to be lower?

823
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,800
Father is reluctant to listen to you.

824
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,440
I will rely on myself

825
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,840
to fight for it then.

826
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,320
In this life,

827
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,480
I must step on

828
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,160
Hua'er and Ru'er.

829
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,640
Child, you have the ambition.

830
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,120
It's just that I fear,

831
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,440
this improper behavior embarrasses

832
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,920
the reputation of the Sheng family.

833
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,560
You are muddle-headed.

834
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,760
What's so important about

835
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,440
the reputation of the Sheng family?

836
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,600
What's more important is

837
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,760
the reputation of Linqi Pavilion.

838
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,320
If embarrassing the reputation of the Sheng family

839
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,880
can give me dignity,

840
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,600
I can even embarrass myself

841
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,560
a hundred times.

842
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,720
That's right.

843
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,040
But just like what I told you earlier,

844
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,920
I fear that Young Lord

845
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,400
only has Sixth Miss in his heart.

846
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,680
If not,

847
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,240
why would he give her such a good brush?

848
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,800
You didn't believe it

849
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,240
and said that he pitied her.

850
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,400
Did he take pity on her again at the Polo field?

851
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,760
Out of so many pitiful people in this world,

852
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,760
why only her?

853
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,160
Think carefully.

854
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,120
If Brother Yuanruo

855
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,360
really has his eyes on Sixth Sister,

856
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,040
how can I get him back?

857
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,920
If the Young Lord already

858
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,880
has someone else in his heart,

859
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,280
thinking about this, it will be very difficult.

860
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,720
But the Sixth Master of the Liang family

861
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,880
has you in his heart.

862
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,280
This is very certain.

863
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,760
The Qi family is that of a duke.

864
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,120
The Liang family is only that of a count.

865
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,120
To add further, he's the sixth son.

866
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,840
There are many older brothers above him.

867
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,760
What has the title to do with him?

868
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,920
Your father doesn't want to speak

869
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,120
the Qi family on our behalf.

870
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,640
We don't have any power left.

871
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,200
If there is luck, it's also good for you

872
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,160
to marry into the Liang family.

873
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,880
If this doesn't work,

874
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,240
we can find another way out.

875
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,360
We can't really

876
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,040
just seek death on one tree, right?

877
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,561
Can the Liang family be considered

878
00:37:13,561 --> 00:37:14,840
as another way out?

879
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,480
You have already come this far.

880
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,920
The young master from the Liang family

881
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,360
has been courting you and writing poems.

882
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,520
This is still not considered as another way out?

883
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,320
Don't complain that he can't be an count.

884
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,920
He has an count's manor,

885
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,080
wife and private savings

886
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,920
which can last you for three generations.

887
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,240
When you subsequently receive a rank,

888
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,200
you will be able to give orders then.

889
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,440
My daughter,

890
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,760
you are very smart.

891
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,840
Why can't you figure this out?

892
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,960
You are right.

893
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,640
Whether it's the House of Duke Qi of the State

894
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,000
or the House of Count of Yongchang,

895
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,960
it's still better than Eldest Sister's

896
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,440
nothing-special House of the Count of Zhongqin.

897
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,840
This is the right way.

898
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,360
No matter who you marry,

899
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,720
it's enough to make those people in Weirui Balcony

900
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,600
to hate you for a period.

901
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,720
But Father has been angry

902
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,200
with us lately.

903
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,400
Would he detest us?

904
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,600
Do you think that

905
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,760
Big Madam Wang has a good mouth?

906
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,440
Don't worry. In a few days,

907
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,200
your father will be back.

908
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,040
I have finished the calculation.

909
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,440
There are three people in Linqi Pavilion.

910
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,680
Mistress Lin, Third Brother and Fourth Sister.

911
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,800
It's a total of eighteen strings of coins per month.

912
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,520
I fear I can't carry it.

913
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,360
Please let me have it in silver instead.

914
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,640
There is not that much silver left.

915
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,000
Third Brother was here today too.

916
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,880
Why don't I

917
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,840
ask him to help you?

918
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,760
Third Brother

919
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,000
came specially to see you.

920
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I dare not impose on him.

921
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,360
His hands are for writing and painting.

922
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,320
He won't be able to endure it.

923
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,360
We will release the silver then.

924
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,760
A total of fifteen

925
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,000
and four one-hundredths of silver.

926
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,360
Miss Cuiwei has good eyesight.

927
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,320
I will be lazy then.

928
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,120
I don't need to check it.

929
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,320
I will see you out.

930
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,960
I came all the way to see you

931
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,760
and it's still not good enough?

932
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,000
There are so many maids in there.

933
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,360
I dote on you very much.

934
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,920
It's just that

935
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,040
I can't do anything now.

936
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,160
You have really suffered.

937
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,680
Third Brother.

938
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,760
We should go back.

939
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,880
You even said that you doted on me.

940
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,560
When somebody calls you,

941
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,880
you just abandon me.

942
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,760
This is Third Brother's old love.

943
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,880
As a little sister,

944
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,800
taking away someone he loves

945
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,720
makes me feel uneasy.

946
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,680
Why don't I...

947
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,160
Third Brother,

948
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,320
it's time to go back.

949
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,360
Third Brother, take care.

950
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,600
Miss Ke'er,

951
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,360
you cry three times per day.

952
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,600
Don't you think it's unlucky?

953
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,960
That darn Ke'er's pestering

954
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,600
was spotted

955
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,960
by the Sixth Miss and I.

956
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,080
I didn't know where to hide my face.

957
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,200
It's because this seductresses

958
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,480
kept pestering him day and night,

959
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,920
that's why my Feng wasn't able to pass!

960
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,080
That's right.

961
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,400
At first, we planned to throw away

962
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,480
those two troublesome seductress away

963
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,292
and let Third Brother focus on his studies.

964
00:41:09,292 --> 00:41:09,840
If this continues...

965
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,080
Anyway,

966
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,480
he's now making up excuses

967
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,960
to go to Mucang Pagoda to see his woman.

968
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,200
That's far better than

969
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,200
them always loitering around in front of him as before.

970
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,560
Go and tell that Ke'er

971
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,080
that if she behaves

972
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,120
and find out information for me,

973
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,480
she still has the chance to come back.

974
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,600
If she still dares to pester my Feng'er again,

975
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,600
I will immediately

976
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,560
sell her slave deed to a brothel.

977
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,560
Yes

978
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,680
But she and Mei'er both

979
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,000
can still obtain information.

980
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,840
She was the one who told us

981
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,240
about Sixth Miss kneeling the entire night,

982
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,160
a few nights ago.

983
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,760
She's still trying to take credit for someone else's achievements

984
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,840
and buy her way back to Third Brother's room

985
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,600
to serve him.

986
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,800
Dream on.

987
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,080
If we don't dismiss them,

988
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,560
how will Feng'er pass the examination?

989
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,040
That's right.

990
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,800
It's a pity.

991
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,000
I wanted to kill two birds with one stone

992
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,320
and let Mei'er bring back information.

993
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,640
And also make use of Sixth Miss

994
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,560
to get rid of the both of them.

995
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,720
I didn't expect

996
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,720
her to be that useless.

997
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,400
She's weak, easily bullied

998
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,440
and still wants to manage the house?

999
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,880
How can this house

1000
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,000
do without me?

1001
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,200
Our Imperial Tutor is sick. He's not receiving any visitors.

1002
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,000
Please go back.

1003
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,320
See? It's just

1004
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,280
what I said.

1005
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,800
Second Master,

1006
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,160
the information from the Yu family,

1007
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,400
I fear I won't be able to get it.

1008
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,640
Should we try another family?

1009
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,720
From what I know

1010
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,000
Minister Hu's daughter has just reached the age of marriage.

1011
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,920
Second Young Master,

1012
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,080
if you insist on

1013
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,560
the eldest granddaughter of the old Grand Tutor,

1014
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,320
we can only ask your mother

1015
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,120
to personally seek the marriage.

1016
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,840
They surely won't disrespect

1017
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,840
a wife of a Marquis, right?

1018
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,000
Matchmaker Zhou.

1019
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,560
You will definitely earn the tips from me.

1020
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,960
Thank you, Second Master.

1021
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,360
If there's any information from this family,

1022
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,720
I will definitely inform you.
