00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Story of Minglan

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,896
Episode 33

3
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,000
Mother!

4
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,640
Molan!

5
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,320
Mother!

6
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,120
Molan!

7
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:08,840
Mother!

8
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,600
Molan!

9
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,640
Molan!

10
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,000
Let me see you.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,400
My Molan.

12
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,000
You.How come

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,160
your father let you out?

14
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,000
Could it be the marriage

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,320
with the House of Liang is set

16
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,320
That's right.

17
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,680
It was that old woman from Shouan Hall

18
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,920
who personally went to propose marriage.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,480
Even if she's an old fairy

20
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,030
that has lived for decades,

21
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,760
didn't she still submit to our tricks

22
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,520
in the end.

23
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,280
You have finally

24
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,880
achieved success. So did I!

25
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,950
Mother,

26
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,480
Father let me out to see you.

27
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,440
I am afraid that

28
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,480
from now on...

29
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,160
I'm worried about you.

30
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,760
Don't be afraid.

31
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,920
When that Concubine Wei died,

32
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,200
he also did something like this to me.

33
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,000
In the end,

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,720
your father reconciled with me, too.

35
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,000
It's fine. Moreover,

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,840
that woman in Shouan Hall

37
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,760
isn't really his birth mother.

38
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,350
He won't be that obedient with that Old Madam.

39
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,080
Don't worry.

40
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,520
At most,

41
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,717
I'll just employ some tricks like

42
00:02:21,717 --> 00:02:23,240
attempting to commit suicide or something.

43
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,520
Your father will

44
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,920
obediently return to the palm of my hand.

45
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,920
When will the wedding be? Did they say?

46
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,120
They said that they will choose an auspicious date

47
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,574
within this month to fetch me

48
00:02:31,574 --> 00:02:32,200
with a wedding palanquin into their house.

49
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,680
This month...

50
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,760
It's a bit rushed.

51
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,523
But for a marriage that was so hard

52
00:02:39,523 --> 00:02:40,200
to obtain like this.

53
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,353
It's better to do it as soon as possible

54
00:02:41,353 --> 00:02:41,955
for us to be at ease,

55
00:02:41,955 --> 00:02:42,840
to prevent any more nightmares.

56
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,520
Okay.

57
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,520
Come here.

58
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,280
These are the items

59
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,680
I've saved for the past years.

60
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,440
A count's house is an aristocratic family.

61
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,960
If you don't bring a lot of dowry,

62
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,480
you might get laughed at.

63
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,520
But it's just that

64
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,880
these items...

65
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,240
I must save some for your older brother...

66
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,280
or else..?

67
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,560
Mother,

68
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,640
even if you give me all of these,

69
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,680
it won't even reach

70
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,880
half of the dowry of Eldest Sister.

71
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,080
I'll just bring a few more.

72
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,280
When you married into the Sheng Family,

73
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,680
you didn't have anything as well.

74
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,720
But now,

75
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,000
you live a grander life than Big Madam does.

76
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,160
I have the resolve.

77
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,160
Even if I don't rely on my maiden dowry,

78
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,238
I still will be able to live

79
00:03:48,238 --> 00:03:49,160
a splendid life among my in-laws.

80
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,120
My Molan is obedient and ambitious.

81
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,240
You are more promising than your older brother!

82
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,200
If your older brother

83
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,960
could have even half of your scheming,

84
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,640
this Sheng Family would have been

85
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,360
under our control a long time ago.

86
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,080
What a pity...

87
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,960
Mother.

88
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,640
Mother, if I leave

89
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,450
and your days here in the Sheng Family

90
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,040
become unbearable,

91
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,800
don't be troubled by it.

92
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,280
You just need to patiently wait for a few days,

93
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,640
wait for me make a footing

94
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,480
in the House of Liang,

95
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,720
I'll then come back to fetch you.

96
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,880
Okay. Okay.

97
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,080
With just those words from you, I'm at ease.

98
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,760
That very fertile farmland in the capital outskirts

99
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,440
and the shop in the south

100
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,400
please give them to me.

101
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,560
Third Brother won't have any use for them.

102
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,560
Bringing them can provide me something to rely on.

103
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,040
Fourth Miss,

104
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,360
when you go out later,

105
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,640
don't stand too straight.

106
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,360
Slightly bend your body, okay?

107
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,280
Fourth Miss is coming out!

108
00:06:30,975 --> 00:06:33,600
I'm going to get married today.

109
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
Bid farewell to my parents.

110
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,005
Wish Father and Mother

111
00:06:39,005 --> 00:06:42,472
a long life and unending wealth.

112
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,280
Since you're getting married today,

113
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,680
you will become a member of another house.

114
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,359
Once you reach your husband's house,

115
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:54,160
be filial to your father and mother-in-law,

116
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,560
Everything is your fortune.

117
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,320
Okay then. Let's not miss the auspicious time.

118
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,440
Go out now.

119
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,280
Mistress, the duty of sending off the bride

120
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,010
is the job of the main wife.

121
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,560
You're a person from the back courtyard.

122
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,520
It's not proper for you to move forward.

123
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,210
It's my daughter's wedding today.

124
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,229
Can't I at least see her

125
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:32,490
getting into her wedding palanquin?

126
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,164
Master said the Sheng Family

127
00:08:34,164 --> 00:08:35,320
couldn't bear to be embarrassed

128
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,303
letting people from the House of Liang

129
00:08:36,303 --> 00:08:37,120
who are here to welcome the bride

130
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,280
see how unruly you are.

131
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,880
Darling Hong!

132
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,720
Quickly drag her back!

133
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,400
Mother...

134
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,240
I'm leaving soon.

135
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,800
Father,

136
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,200
are you still not willing to talk to me?

137
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,240
From today,

138
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,760
you will become part of another family.

139
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,880
There's nothing to say.

140
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,800
I am deeply grateful to Father for raising me.

141
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,120
No need for that.

142
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,449
I've doted on you, but didn't expect

143
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,160
that you'd grow up like this.

144
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,320
Once you reach the Liang Family,

145
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,840
whether you enjoy good fortunes or endure hardships,

146
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,680
they are all your own fate.

147
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,800
If you suffer any grievances in the future,

148
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,240
no need for you to come back here and cry about it.

149
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,720
Wasn't this a path you chose yourself?

150
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,040
Why are you crying now?

151
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,360
Father, you said it right.

152
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,120
It's a path that I've chosen myself.

153
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,840
I will never regret it.

154
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,880
Third Brother, let's go.

155
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,160
The bride is getting married!

156
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,080
Minister

157
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,800
there are still a lot of guests outside.

158
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,880
We still have to

159
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,200
entertain them.

160
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,320
Thanks for your work.

161
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,920
What are you doing?

162
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,960
Dongrong! Dongrong! Dongrong!

163
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,120
I'm the mother-in-law of the son of a count!

164
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,600
Who dares to touch me!

165
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,160
I'm the mother-in-law

166
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,200
of the son of a count!

167
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,920
My daughter will be the Big Madam

168
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,960
of the Count's Manor.

169
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,120
If you all dare to be disrespectful to me

170
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,120
I'll make sure that you will die a miserable death!

171
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,400
What do you want to do?

172
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:05,920
Darling Hong! How can you be this heartless?

173
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,320
I chose not to be the main wife

174
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,920
of someone

175
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,440
and became your concubine!

176
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,389
I suffered supercilious looks

177
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:18,040
for more than twenty years!

178
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,800
I bore and raised a son and a daughter for you.

179
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,800
Darling Hong

180
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,880
Darling Hong! Darling H-Hong...

181
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,840
How could you be this heart...heartless!

182
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Stop hitting!

183
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,200
All of you, go out.

184
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,280
I'll kill you!

185
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,680
Send her to Pingling Farmstead outside the city.

186
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,280
Imprison her there,

187
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,400
and she's not allowed to leave forever.

188
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,120
What about the other people of Linqi Pavilion?

189
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,582
Cane those two that disguised

190
00:15:41,582 --> 00:15:42,360
themselves as Molan to death.

191
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:43,954
For the rest,

192
00:15:43,954 --> 00:15:45,360
look for a slave trafficker to sell them.

193
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,240
Not even one must stay behind.

194
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,200
Master, think about it carefully.

195
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,640
If they will just die or get sold like this,

196
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,360
the whole courtyard will become empty.

197
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,091
I fear that outsiders will deduce that

198
00:15:55,091 --> 00:15:55,960
something happened inside our house.

199
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,840
Those two that accompanied

200
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,110
and disguised as Molan

201
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:04,600
didn't report the situation immediately.

202
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:06,267
They are ones with the masterminds

203
00:16:06,267 --> 00:16:07,000
and must be beaten to death.

204
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:09,240
Just find a reason to explain

205
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,440
that to the people gossiping outside.

206
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,280
Just keep the others at first.

207
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,520
Send them to the front courtyard to do manual labor

208
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,000
like cleaning commodes or washing clothes.

209
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,960
After a year or more

210
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,440
when things have settled down,

211
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,177
look for a slave trafficker

212
00:16:32,177 --> 00:16:32,840
and slowly sell them off.

213
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:36,975
Got it.

214
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:27,920
Wait!

215
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,400
Is Mistress Lin inside?

216
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:31,880
She is

217
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,200
Xiaotao, do you have any instructions?

218
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,440
Old Madam ordered that

219
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,960
Sixth Miss will follow your carriage.

220
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,243
She must personally see Mistress Lin

221
00:17:38,243 --> 00:17:38,880
enter the farmstead.

222
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,640
Mount Pingling is a very nasty place.

223
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,720
How could the Sixth Miss go there?

224
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,640
I also don't know why

225
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,160
Old Madam made such an instruction.

226
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,560
How about going to ask her?

227
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:49,960
I dare not.

228
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,460
I just fear that Sixth Miss

229
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,440
might tire herself because of this.

230
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,080
You leave first.

231
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,160
Okay.

232
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,240
Let's go.

233
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,720
Quickly!

234
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,840
Go.

235
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Sixth Miss has entered her carriage and left.

236
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,840
I saw it is late,

237
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,680
so I ordered that she be assisted

238
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,000
by four physically-strong servants.

239
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,440
Since this is a special task,

240
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,280
don't know

241
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,840
if we get to have some rewards when they return.

242
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,160
Nanny Fang, don't you know about it?

243
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:10,920
Sixth Miss said that

244
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,007
it was Old Madam who told her

245
00:19:12,007 --> 00:19:12,920
to escort the carriage.

246
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,760
When did I tell her

247
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,120
to escort Lin Qinshuang?

248
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:19,432
When I heard it,

249
00:19:19,432 --> 00:19:20,320
I already sensed that something's wrong.

250
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,680
I then just pretended to

251
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,600
know and hurriedly returned.

252
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,720
This concerns Sixth Miss.

253
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,040
It's better to be careful.

254
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,600
Go get Danju and let's ask her.

255
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,040
I've already asked.

256
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,440
Danju said that

257
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,600
Sixth Miss told her

258
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,467
that she's just going to stroll

259
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:36,160
in the garden before she left.

260
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,120
Nothing was abnormal.

261
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:43,240
Could she have gone there

262
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,080
to mock Lin Qinshuang?

263
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,000
I really thank for

264
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,760
escorting our Miss on this trip.

265
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,080
Here.

266
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,240
This is for your tea.

267
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,000
Can you hear that bitch

268
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,120
shouting?

269
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,040
With her committing such a crime,

270
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,600
does she still want

271
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,160
the Sheng House to

272
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,360
invite a doctor for her?

273
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,160
Damned little bastard!

274
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,800
Did you come to laugh at me?

275
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,280
Was it Darling Hong who told you to come?

276
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,600
It must be that shrew Wang Ruofu

277
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,400
who told you to come, right?

278
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,160
Listen carefully.

279
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,120
Although I got thrown in here,

280
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,440
I'm still the birth mother of

281
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,440
the daughter-in-law of a count.

282
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,120
Once my Molan has stably seated herself

283
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,560
inside the House of Liang,

284
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,920
I can still return and stably sit in my Linqi Pavilion.

285
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:36,840
The House of Liang once wanted you

286
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,280
as their daughter-in-law.

287
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,240
What a pity!

288
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,080
my Molan was more skillful than you.

289
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,440
Even if you are too jealous

290
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,040
to live now,

291
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,040
it's of no use!

292
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,080
I've never thought of

293
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,080
marrying into the House of Liang.

294
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,149
You didn't want to be married off

295
00:22:03,149 --> 00:22:03,640
into the Liang Family?

296
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,080
You did it deliberately.

297
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,720
You deliberately got close with Big Madam Wu.

298
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,200
You deliberately...

299
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,200
You caused us...

300
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:19,840
caused us to think that

301
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,920
you're getting married off into the House of Liang.

302
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,520
This way, Molan and I would make a dangerous

303
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,480
move of privately meeting Liang Han.

304
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,160
It was you. It was you!

305
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,960
But why?

306
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,440
Why didn't you want to be the main madam

307
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,880
of the House of Liang?

308
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,160
Why must you let my Molan...

309
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,720
What did you know?

310
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,720
Impossible.

311
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,800
How could you know anything?

312
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,640
I'm not afraid!

313
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:24,800
I'm not afraid.

314
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,400
Even if you sue me in Kaifeng Court,

315
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,680
they won't find any evidence against me.

316
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,760
It was she who harmed me.

317
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,800
It was she who harmed me first!

318
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,280
It was she who went against me first!

319
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,600
I'm not afraid of anything.

320
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,000
She was bought by that bitch Wang Ruofu

321
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,440
to deal with me.

322
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,320
A woman bought by

323
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,880
that bitch Wang Ruofu...

324
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,356
She clearly knew that darling Hong

325
00:23:53,356 --> 00:23:54,000
loves me the most,

326
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,080
yet she had to keep bearing him children!

327
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,160
After giving birth to you this little bitch,

328
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,840
she even wanted to bear a son to depend on!

329
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,800
Anyone who blocks my path

330
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,720
will be kicked away by me!

331
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,600
I'm not afraid!

332
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,280
What really are you

333
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,040
scheming against Molan!

334
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,400
Minglan...

335
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,160
What else...

336
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,320
are you scheming?

337
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,400
Tell me.

338
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:43,640
What evil plan do you have?

339
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,960
Tell me.

340
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,080
Don't go!

341
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,560
Come back here!

342
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,880
Sheng Minglan!

343
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,240
Servant!

344
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,840
Help!

345
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,320
Someone wants to harm...

346
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,120
the daughter-in-law of the House of Count Yongchang...

347
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,200
Don't leave.

348
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,000
Sheng Minglan!

349
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,160
Grandmother

350
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,448
I especially came to greet you

351
00:25:54,448 --> 00:25:55,440
and wish you good health.

352
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,680
I'm currently doing some liuyao divination

353
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:14,920
but am still unable to

354
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,760
decipher your thoughts.

355
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,800
I indeed am hiding something from you.

356
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,480
You're sure that

357
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,680
I won't expose you?

358
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,520
Grandmother

359
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,240
I'm thinking that

360
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,640
you are the person

361
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,360
who dotes on me the most in this world.

362
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,120
The person who dotes on you the most

363
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,920
has now been manipulated by you.

364
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,955
So lamentable that after

365
00:26:54,955 --> 00:26:56,040
raising you for so many years,

366
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,600
I actually got tricked by you,

367
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,680
but still can't bear to expose you.

368
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,240
I have a grand undertaking.

369
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:11,775
I dared not inform you beforehand.

370
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,560
I also dare not ask for your forgiveness.

371
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,560
Since you couldn't tell me beforehand

372
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,400
now that things have been done,

373
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,680
say it then.

374
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,000
It's still not the time to say it?

375
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,920
You're now a grown-up

376
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,000
and have learned to have bold ideas.

377
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,800
You have learned to beat around the bush with me.

378
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,800
If there is any problem, just directly tell me.

379
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,080
I will solve it for you.

380
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,760
Still not telling me?

381
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:01,875
Fine.

382
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,280
Don't go out of your room these next few days.

383
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,480
Go back to your chamber and think about it well.

384
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,265
Once you've thought it through,

385
00:28:11,265 --> 00:28:12,640
come here to tell it to me.

386
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,640
Yes.

387
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,240
This girl...

388
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,120
What really is she planning?

389
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:38,440
Miss has never left her courtyard

390
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,960
by a step these two days.

391
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,240
She only practices writing or embroiders flowers.

392
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,040
When she gets bored,

393
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,600
she just strolls around the garden

394
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,800
and loose the soil.

395
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,560
She didn't mention Pingling Farmstead?

396
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,320
She didn't.

397
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,800
Miss isn't a talkative person

398
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,640
usually.

399
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,600
She never talks more than what's necessary.

400
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,520
Have you asked Xiaotao?

401
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,480
I did.

402
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,920
Xiaotao said

403
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,240
that Miss entered the room

404
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,160
and told her to stay outside.

405
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,320
After a while

406
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,720
Miss came out and took her away.

407
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,760
She also doesn't know anything.

408
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,080
That Sixth Girl can really keep her composure.

409
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,242
If it were the others,

410
00:29:16,242 --> 00:29:16,920
they would have started panicking

411
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,960
after being treated coldly for these past few days.

412
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,600
She's able to remain so calm

413
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,880
and still won't tell it to me.

414
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,600
She has grown up

415
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,480
and has her own ideas.

416
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:34,480
When you attend to her,

417
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,280
keep watch of her more.

418
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,200
If there are any movements or clues,

419
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,280
come back to report them to me.

420
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,400
Don't be afraid for her to call you a spy.

421
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,880
You indeed are serving by her side,

422
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,400
but I was the one who sent you to her.

423
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:51,550
Yes.

424
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,080
I'm here to congratulate

425
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,480
Big Madam!

426
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,240
Rulan still has no marriage prospect.

427
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:17,040
How can I have things to celebrate?

428
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,723
Today, a servant from Pingling Farmstead

429
00:30:19,723 --> 00:30:20,720
came back to report that

430
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,680
that woman from Linqi Pavilion

431
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,320
has died in prison.

432
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:29,600
Is that for real?

433
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,400
She got locked up for just two or three days.

434
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,000
How come she's dead?

435
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,680
Did you hear it clearly?

436
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,960
No. I asked the servant for several times.

437
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,560
It's true.

438
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,600
How did she die? Did he say?

439
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,480
He said that she died from illness.

440
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,840
You didn't even go ask around?

441
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,640
I know your thoughts very well.

442
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,240
I've meticulously asked around.

443
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,240
They said that it's a complication from caning her.

444
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,440
Dongrong was the one who caned her.

445
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,080
Dongrong is the trusted aide of Minister.

446
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,200
How could there be something wrong with his caning?

447
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,640
I heard that

448
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,600
Dongrong knows an ancestral special skill.

449
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,040
How could there be something wrong with his caning?

450
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,480
Just one caning and he can lacerate your flesh.

451
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,160
A special skill?

452
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,760
His grandfather used to work in the local court.

453
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,280
No wonder when her son

454
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,160
almost lost Hualan's betrothal geese,

455
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,240
he was able to actively jump around in

456
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,960
less than two days after being caned.

457
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,288
Could that bitch bear to

458
00:31:29,288 --> 00:31:30,600
let her son be caned like that?

459
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,480
I heard that after that

460
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,840
bitch suffered lacerations,

461
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,294
the people in the farmstead

462
00:31:35,294 --> 00:31:36,520
weren't allowed to give her any medical treatment.

463
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,480
Afterwards,

464
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,760
the skin became necrotic.

465
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,600
In a few days, she died.

466
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,550
If Master learns

467
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,440
about Dongrong's skills...

468
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,640
He surely knows.

469
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,720
This means that bitch suffering

470
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,880
this much and dying from it

471
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,880
must be Master's—

472
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,800
Madam, don't be afraid.

473
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,040
Master must have been so mad.

474
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,640
That bitch indulged her daughter excessively.

475
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,720
If not because Old Madam came out to help,

476
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,640
all the children in this family would have suffered.

477
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,320
Master must be so angry at her.

478
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,400
The Minister isn't only angry at

479
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,200
her for tainting the reputation of our family,

480
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,200
he also hates her for

481
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,000
deceiving him for so many years.

482
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,400
He also hates her for not continuing her lies,

483
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,960
when she had already

484
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,840
deceived him.

485
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,600
He hates her for saying the truth

486
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,920
when she was about to achieve success.

487
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,520
Madam

488
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,680
I'll go warm you some lamb wine

489
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,160
to warm your body.

490
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,840
Informing Old Madam

491
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,920
Concubine Lin has died.

492
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,320
When did it happen? How did she die?

493
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:36,600
She was discovered this morning.

494
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,688
When the person delivering her food

495
00:33:37,688 --> 00:33:38,840
went in and touched her,

496
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,800
she was already very cold.

497
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,042
They said that she was already sick

498
00:33:42,042 --> 00:33:43,000
when brought in there.

499
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:45,040
She was spouting so much rubbish.

500
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,480
She must have died from her illness.

501
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,640
We and her family

502
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,440
are not really old acquaintances,

503
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,880
but her family claimed to have one.

504
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,080
When their family fell,

505
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,760
they just handed her to me.

506
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,880
Lin Qinshuang

507
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,960
could pretend to be confused and ignorant

508
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,720
even if she had

509
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,200
so many ideas in her head.

510
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,440
Having an ending like this...

511
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,600
How many troubles

512
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,080
has she caused our family?

513
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,280
We still don't even know

514
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,880
if she committed murder.

515
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,440
Old Madam,

516
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,880
you've already been extremely benevolent with her.

517
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,600
Murder?

518
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,800
So that is what it is.

519
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,320
I see.

520
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,680
What are you talking about?

521
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,080
Sixth Miss

522
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:43,840
is here to greet you!

523
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,160
Miss, please come in.

524
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,640
We have newly-brewed tea prepared.

525
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,000
I'm here to ask for punishment for my crime.

526
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,160
You went to Pingling Farmstead

527
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,720
to do this?

528
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:09,720
Grandmother, you already knew?

529
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,800
I'm still not a dotard.

530
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,360
You all stop what you're doing.

531
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,880
Something is happening here today,

532
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,040
so you all do your work first outside.

533
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,200
Yeah Yeah

534
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,790
Tell the people outside

535
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:27,560
that if there's nothing important,

536
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,040
don't come in here.

537
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,040
Yeah

538
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:38,880
Lin Qinshuang killed my mother,

539
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,875
destroyed the evidence

540
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,640
and was able to evade the law.

541
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,600
Now, I've finally found

542
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,760
the witnesses from that time

543
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,040
and obtained their testimonies.

544
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:49,960
However.

545
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,480
Father was unwilling to

546
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,320
allow this scandalous incident to see light again.

547
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,480
I had no choice

548
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,520
but to set up a plan

549
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,400
and let Mistress Lin walk into it.

550
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:01,000
That mother and daughter were greedy for vanity.

551
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,320
They willing degraded themselves

552
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,800
and did such a scandalous act.

553
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,280
How could it be something

554
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,840
that you could plan?

555
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,800
It was me.

556
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,040
At first

557
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,240
I just wanted to irritate Fourth Sister

558
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,120
and forced her to commit a mistake.

559
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:18,760
In this way

560
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,200
Mistress Lin would defend her like she used to

561
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,120
and commit a mistake with her.

562
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,800
But when Fourth Sister

563
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,240
saw me being close with the Liang family,

564
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,920
she became very jealous

565
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,760
and repeatedly berated me in anger.

566
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,320
I then realized that

567
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,421
there was actually

568
00:37:35,421 --> 00:37:36,560
this another path that I could take.

569
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,717
Hence, I tried to get closer

570
00:37:39,717 --> 00:37:41,080
with the House of Liang

571
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,000
to irritate Fourth Sister.

572
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,640
Forced her to almost damage my face.

573
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:47,040
But I never thought that

574
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,120
Father still chose

575
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,200
not to punish Mistress Lin.

576
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,200
It was me.

577
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,240
I've earlier known that Liang Han

578
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,560
and Fourth Sister were having an affair.

579
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,720
I just watched as they stepped deeply into the mud.

580
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,800
It was also I....

581
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,305
who hinted that Big Madam

582
00:38:04,305 --> 00:38:05,520
should go to Yuqing Monastery...

583
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,520
and find out about their secret affair.

584
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,880
Are you muddled?

585
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,275
Is this something

586
00:38:16,275 --> 00:38:18,040
that an unmarried rich daughter like you can do?

587
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,280
With such a complicated and twisted scheme,

588
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,280
just one wrong move

589
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,680
and you could have ruined your reputation!

590
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,480
Your life would be over!

591
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,280
Did you thought about that?

592
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,160
I did.

593
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,723
But the grudge for my mother's death

594
00:38:34,723 --> 00:38:35,800
was absolutely irreconcilable!

595
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,080
All these appearance,

596
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,160
reputation and marriage

597
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,560
are nothing to me!

598
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,400
Concubine Lin Qinshuang

599
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,480
killed my mother.

600
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,080
One corpse, two lives.

601
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,000
Now that she's dead

602
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,400
she deserves it,

603
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,320
and would not expiate all her crimes!

604
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,160
Even if I had died

605
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,720
I would climb up from

606
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,640
my grave to seek vengeance!

607
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,080
You usually looked so obedient and docile,

608
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,200
always stooping to compromise.

609
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,320
Is that all just an act?

610
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,680
The heavens and earth can be my witness

611
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,560
that my respect

612
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,480
and love for you are all true.

613
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,200
It's just that

614
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,960
after I've done such a thing,

615
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,080
I know that I deserve to be punished to death.

616
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,320
Please punish me.

617
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,840
It's my fault...

618
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,680
my fault.

619
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,600
I didn't

620
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,800
seek justice for you.

621
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,400
I allowed you

622
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,840
to do such a dangerous thing by yourself.

623
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,360
Grandmother

624
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,160
I don't regret it.

625
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,040
It was I who wronged you.

626
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:15,040
I've been lying to you.

627
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,880
Hit me.

628
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,280
Sorry, Grandmother.

629
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:24,920
Does it hurt?

630
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,560
It doesn't.

631
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,280
Do any of the servants in your courtyard

632
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,960
know the truth?

633
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,440
I dared not leak any of it.

634
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,800
I was afraid that it would alarm the enemy.

635
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,200
Okay. That's good then.

636
00:40:48,225 --> 00:40:50,280
Other than the two of us,

637
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,640
no one else must know about this matter.

638
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,240
Let's just treat

639
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,080
that it has never happened.

640
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,320
Just let this matter...

641
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,920
pass like that.

642
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:24,960
Move aside!

643
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,120
Move aside!

644
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,000
Move aside!

645
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,738
The Emperor's army achieved great victory!

646
00:41:33,738 --> 00:41:35,040
They've defeated the rebel army!

647
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,240
Good!

648
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,075
Brother Bai!

649
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,320
Oh wait, I should be calling you Officer Bai now.

650
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,560
Inside closed doors,

651
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,360
it's better to call me "brother".

652
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,680
Saying "officer" feels like we're strangers.

653
00:41:59,120 --> 00:41:59,720
I wouldn't dare

654
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,540
go to your house next time!

655
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,360
No way.

656
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:02,280
The gates of our house

657
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,000
are always open for you.

658
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,280
There will always be good food

659
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,040
and tea waiting for you whenever you come.

660
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,680
Don't be angry at me once

661
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,600
I've eaten all your family's rice!

662
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,320
After fighting in the south for several months,

663
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,520
there are actually so many newcomers here now.

664
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:21,280
Young Master.
