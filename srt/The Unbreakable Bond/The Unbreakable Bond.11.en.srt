00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,000
=Episode 11=

4
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,819
You're a woman.
How could it be the same?

5
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,919
Why can't a woman do the same?

6
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:50,298
According to my rules,

7
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:51,258
a woman can do anything

8
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,639
a man can do.

9
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,279
Moreover,

10
00:00:54,379 --> 00:00:56,179
Lord Ming, didn't I just divorce you

11
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,840
a few days ago?

12
00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:00,599
No, I...

13
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,720
Lord Ming, you shouldn't interrupt us
if you haven't

14
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,960
organized your thoughts.

15
00:01:11,499 --> 00:01:12,498
Look at her.

16
00:01:12,499 --> 00:01:15,120
How is she so stubborn and unyielding?

17
00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:17,040
She's not willing to yield at all.

18
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,299
Your Highness,
please don't be impatient.

19
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,919
I'm sure we'll find a solution to it.

20
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:33,320
Miss Chuxia, when will you
let go of my hand?

21
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:39,359
That was an urgent situation.

22
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:41,680
You shouldn't take my words

23
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,880
to heart.

24
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:48,639
Seems like I can only
be your bosom friend

25
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,840
for 15 minutes, huh?

26
00:01:56,139 --> 00:01:57,840
Lord Ming haunts me to no end.

27
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,400
I suppose he'll try to pester me

28
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,120
at the General's Residence
after a few days.

29
00:02:01,339 --> 00:02:02,880
I can cope with his nonsense.

30
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,159
I'm just worried
that he might bother Yue.

31
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:08,480
I'll move into
the General's Residence today.

32
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:11,000
If Ziyan comes and pesters you again,

33
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,839
I can be your shield.

34
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,280
Why are you helping me out?

35
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,239
Could it be

36
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,519
that you have an ulterior motive?

37
00:02:27,499 --> 00:02:30,720
Miss Chuxia, you have to neutralize
my poison for me after all.

38
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,679
Therefore, I shall go wherever you are.

39
00:02:38,779 --> 00:02:40,699
Regarding your stay
at the General's Residence,

40
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,399
I need to confirm it with Yue.

41
00:02:46,619 --> 00:02:48,200
Miss Chuxia, if you're in trouble,

42
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:49,720
you may ring this jade bell.

43
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:51,600
I shall appear immediately.

44
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:06,320
Are you serious?

45
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,299
(General's Residence)

46
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,679
Miss Ling, please wait.

47
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,760
Are you Princess Ziyuan?

48
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:25,818
I saw you when you were reading
Mr. Baili's pulse this afternoon.

49
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:27,880
Have you found a treatment for him?

50
00:03:29,499 --> 00:03:31,098
Indeed. There's a way
to cure his ailment.

51
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:32,239
Are you serious?

52
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:35,119
To cure his ailment,

53
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,440
we need a famous herb
that's stated in medicinal manuals.

54
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,600
It's called Blazing Kirin.

55
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:41,200
But rumor has it
that it's extremely rare.

56
00:03:41,619 --> 00:03:44,119
I don't know where to get it.

57
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,399
Blazing Kirin?

58
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,639
Your Highness,
do you know where we can get it?

59
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,019
Miss Chuxia, if you trust me,

60
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,519
I'll definitely locate the herb for you.

61
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,320
Since Yue trusts you,

62
00:03:54,339 --> 00:03:55,538
I'll trust you as well.

63
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:57,160
Give me three days.
Just wait for my news.

64
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,239
All right.

65
00:03:58,939 --> 00:03:59,720
Yue.

66
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,799
Chuxia.

67
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,399
Why are you only back at this hour?

68
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,839
Dinner has gotten cold, you know?

69
00:04:05,059 --> 00:04:06,399
Yue, sorry for making you worried.

70
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,239
Yue,

71
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:09,538
why did you agree

72
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:11,519
to let Lord Ling stay in your residence?

73
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,600
Lord Ling needs to rest and recuperate.

74
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,600
He also requires your help
to neutralize his poison.

75
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,899
Moreover, Lord Ling lent us a hand

76
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,320
when the General's Residence
was in shambles.

77
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,778
We have no reason to reject him.

78
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:21,680
Fine, then.

79
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,079
Yue, you can make the call
in the General's Residence.

80
00:04:26,739 --> 00:04:27,519
By the way,

81
00:04:27,859 --> 00:04:29,098
I heard from Yunniang

82
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:30,338
that you used up all of your dowries

83
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:32,120
to renovate the General's Residence.

84
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,240
Grandfather left behind
all those dowries for you.

85
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:37,200
I can't accept them.

86
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,218
Yue, we're a family.

87
00:04:40,219 --> 00:04:41,640
There's no need
to differentiate between us.

88
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,379
But...

89
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,139
Yue, enough already.

90
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,178
I'm starving.

91
00:04:44,179 --> 00:04:45,360
Let's eat.

92
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,760
All right. Let's eat.

93
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:55,459
I'll stand guard outside the door, then.

94
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,839
Miss Chuxia, I won't
let anyone bother you during the treatment.

95
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:04,560
Lord Ling,

96
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,880
I need to perform
an acupuncture treatment on your back.

97
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,320
Do you want to undress yourself?

98
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:09,880
Or do you need my help?

99
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,680
I'll do it myself.

100
00:05:22,859 --> 00:05:23,978
Miss Chuxia, what are you...

101
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:24,760
Don't move.

102
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,760
The treatment is done.

103
00:06:09,179 --> 00:06:11,599
Rest early after taking the medicine.

104
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,560
Liang Junye?

105
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,880
(So, he came to the General's Residence
for an ulterior motive.)

106
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,819
(Liang Junye followed me and moved into
the General's Residence.)

107
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,200
(He even brought a night cloak with him.)

108
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,479
(It's more than just a case
of me neutralizing his poison.)

109
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,560
Where did you go
with your night cloak just now?

110
00:06:47,739 --> 00:06:50,200
What's your motive
for coming to the General's Residence?

111
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,639
You may be able to dupe Yue,

112
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:55,719
but you won't be able to dupe me.

113
00:06:58,119 --> 00:06:59,699
Do you still remember
the Rainy Mountain painting

114
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,240
that I requested you to give me?

115
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,800
Of course.

116
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,800
I discovered some clues on the painting,

117
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,840
and they all point toward
the General's Residence.

118
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,760
What clues?

119
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,560
Clues of the Yuyao Pass Incident.

120
00:07:16,179 --> 00:07:17,178
Back then, my grandfather

121
00:07:17,179 --> 00:07:18,760
already died in battle at Yuyao Pass.

122
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:20,519
What evidence are you looking for?

123
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,160
I'm looking for the crime evidence
of the mastermind behind the incident.

124
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,639
Are you saying

125
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,560
that the Yuyao Pass Incident
wasn't caused by an enemy invasion?

126
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:34,000
It was caused by something else instead?

127
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,200
I've investigated the case
for many years.

128
00:07:36,859 --> 00:07:38,440
But the mastermind is meticulous.

129
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,240
He covered up his crime perfectly,

130
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,360
keeping the world in the dark.

131
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,920
Why are you this concerned
about the Yuyao Pass Incident?

132
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,560
What has this got to do with you?

133
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:54,839
It concerns a late friend of mine.

134
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:01,240
Since that's the case,

135
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,680
we should capture
the mastermind together.

136
00:08:07,179 --> 00:08:09,459
If it was a hidden conspiracy

137
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,800
instead of a defeat in battle,

138
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,800
I have to clear my grandfather's name

139
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,279
so that my mother, who suffered
a wrongful death, can rest in peace.

140
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,499
The investigation

141
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,360
might put us in danger.

142
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,440
I've suffered for so many years
at the Prime Minister's Residence.

143
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,159
Now, I fear nothing.

144
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,839
From today onward,

145
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,160
we shall conduct
the investigation together.

146
00:08:40,939 --> 00:08:41,999
Deal?

147
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,599
