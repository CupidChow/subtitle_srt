00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,100
=Episode 25=

4
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:47,639
Thank you, everyone for your help.

5
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,879
To show my gratitude,

6
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:51,999
allow me to make a toast.

7
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:56,359
You're hurt. You shouldn't be drinking.

8
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,959
I will make the toast on his behalf.

9
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,459
Uncle,

10
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,459
looks like

11
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,519
you can no longer be
the lackadaisical prince.

12
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,559
You've got to listen to the lady now.

13
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,359
Mr. Baili.

14
00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:17,019
Now that your leg is fine,

15
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,799
what's the first thing you wish to do?

16
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:22,338
Here.

17
00:01:22,339 --> 00:01:23,799
I'd like to go on a trip,

18
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,899
climb mountains for the great views
of the mountains and rivers.

19
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,760
I'd love to go with you.

20
00:01:29,059 --> 00:01:29,880
Sure.

21
00:01:31,699 --> 00:01:33,200
It's late. Where are you going?

22
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,739
I'm going to retrieve my things

23
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,279
from Lord Ling's chamber.

24
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,539
I hope you don't blame me, Uncle.

25
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,320
I was kept in the dark.

26
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:46,719
Sorry you had to suffer, Uncle.

27
00:01:48,339 --> 00:01:49,919
The matter has been resolved.

28
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,480
Let's put it behind us.

29
00:01:52,699 --> 00:01:54,240
But I did notice

30
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,400
that you've become more mature

31
00:01:56,499 --> 00:01:57,680
after becoming Crown Prince.

32
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,760
Don't tease me, Uncle.

33
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:02,480
In the future,

34
00:02:02,499 --> 00:02:04,639
I hope you'd assist me
in my governance, Uncle.

35
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,159
Before, I spent my days
drinking and having fun.

36
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,480
Now that I have to handle
important matters,

37
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:11,399
I realize how powerless I am.

38
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,818
My coronation is in two days.

39
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:15,320
You have to attend, Uncle.

40
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:18,359
I will.

41
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:19,979
Your Highness,

42
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,919
Miss Chuxia will be here soon
to change your dressing.

43
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,519
Duly noted.

44
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,480
I shall take my leave, then.

45
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:29,799
Take care of yourself.

46
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,639
Mother,

47
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,040
if you were still alive,

48
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,119
would you have swallowed
the humiliation

49
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,699
and retired alongside Father?

50
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,139
I've notified the emperor-elect

51
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:49,739
Crown Prince

52
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,359
about my retirement.

53
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,618
We will return to our hometown
after the coronation.

54
00:02:53,619 --> 00:02:54,560
Before then,

55
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,040
go and pack up your mother's things.

56
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,000
Your Royal Highness,

57
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:16,160
I know my father has sinned.

58
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:17,679
But the family is innocent.

59
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,160
I beg Your Royal Highness

60
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,040
to spare my family.

61
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,959
I'm willing to do anything.

62
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:33,239
Stop crying, Luoluo.

63
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,818
I know

64
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,399
you're not involved in those crimes.

65
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:39,600
I will pardon you and your family.

66
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,799
But Preceptor Yu's death sentence

67
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,519
is final.

68
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,839
I know the gravity
of my father's crimes.

69
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:49,959
Then...

70
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,159
What are you doing in the room?

71
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,560
I...

72
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,279
Well...

73
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:38,519
I...

74
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,760
Why are you covering your face?

75
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,959
Does it look nice?

76
00:04:47,179 --> 00:04:48,560
Princess Ziyuan said

77
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,760
that this is the latest makeup trend.

78
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,839
What do you think?

79
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,159
It's nice, yes.

80
00:04:55,539 --> 00:04:57,399
You shouldn't hang out
with Princess Ziyuan.

81
00:04:57,739 --> 00:04:59,059
You liar.

82
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,959
You're...

83
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:02,819
Sorry.

84
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,738
- You look nice.
- I...

85
00:05:03,739 --> 00:05:05,719
I forgot you're still injured.

86
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:08,200
I'll help you back to your room.
Let me clean my face first.

87
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,479
Chuxia.

88
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:22,738
Where are you going?

89
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,120
I'm going to get bedding.

90
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:25,599
For what?

91
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,479
To sleep next to you for the convenience

92
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:28,599
of looking after you.

93
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,279
Chuxia,

94
00:05:47,299 --> 00:05:48,599
let me do it.

95
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,440
I'm not the one sleeping here.

96
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,279
He is.

97
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,599
Your Highness.

98
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,418
If Miss Chuxia hadn't asked,

99
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:02,800
I wouldn't be inclined to sleep here.

100
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:04,760
You...

101
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:08,159
Chu...

102
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,920
Chuxia.

103
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,639
Chuxia.

104
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,760
Your Royal Highness.

105
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:19,839
Luoluo.

106
00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:24,360
What did we...

107
00:06:27,299 --> 00:06:28,639
Your Royal Highness,

108
00:06:28,739 --> 00:06:30,120
did you forget?

109
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,560
I'm embarrassed to say.

110
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,120
It's okay, Luoluo.

111
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:39,719
I will be crowned very soon.

112
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,920
I'll then make you the empress of Yue.

113
00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:47,120
To be able to receive your affection,

114
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,079
my life is complete.

115
00:07:01,219 --> 00:07:01,920
You...

116
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:02,218
I...

117
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:03,480
My lord, it's time to get up.

118
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,220
I feel much better after
taking a day off yesterday.

119
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,279
Junye.

120
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:11,240
Chuxia.

121
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,039
Chuxia, just now...

122
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:18,159
Junye,

123
00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:20,440
Liang Ziyan suddenly asked
to see me at the palace.

124
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:23,360
I think it's about time

125
00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:25,240
to clear certain matters with him.

126
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,360
Go on, then.

127
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,360
Do what your heart says.

128
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,120
Before Ziyan announces
the truth about the Yuyao Pass incident,

129
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:34,880
you should resolve the matters
that were put on hold.

130
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,039
May I know why
you asked to see me, Miss Ling?

131
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:42,858
I heard the Prime Minister retired

132
00:07:42,859 --> 00:07:44,360
and is taking you back home.

133
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,399
I won't beat around the bush,

134
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:48,200
Saint of Shuhuang.

135
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,538
What do you mean?

136
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:51,719
No need to pretend.

137
00:07:53,179 --> 00:07:55,760
I found this in
my late mother's belongings.

138
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,880
I bet you know exactly what it is.

139
00:08:02,859 --> 00:08:03,738
What are you saying?

140
00:08:03,739 --> 00:08:05,639
I'll be straight with you, then.

141
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:08,399
I know you're about to be made
Great Yue's empress.

142
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:10,200
And my condition is simple.

143
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,499
I too, want to be married
to the new emperor

144
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,819
and be made consort.

145
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,279
If you won't help me,

146
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,218
I'll publicly expose your identity

147
00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:18,320
as the Saint of Shuhuang.

148
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,599
So you think a painting
of unknown origin

149
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:26,019
would convince people

150
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,538
to believe the words
of a Shuhuang criminal's daughter?

151
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:29,240
You...

152
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,819
If that's the case,

153
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,400
there's no point in talking to you.

154
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,019
I'll report this to His Royal Highness
right this moment.

155
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,458
Let's see if he'd still marry
a woman of Shuhuang.

156
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:39,320
Hang on.

157
00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:42,999
I haven't said no to your condition.

158
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,599
However...

159
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,920
However what?

160
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,280
Who are you people?

161
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,999
