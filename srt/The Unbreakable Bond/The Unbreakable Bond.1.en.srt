=The Unbreakable Bond=
(Adapted from Xiao A'man's novel)

2
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,960
("After the Ugly Concubine Divorced,
She is Wooed By Big Shots of the Capital.")

00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,100
=Episode 1=

4
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,980
(Ling Chuxia, legitimate daughter
of the Prime Minister)

5
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,920
(I am Ling Chuxia,
the Prime Minister's daughter)

6
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,719
(I was not fit to be in the same
wedding with Lord Ming.)

7
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:53,799
(I had to wait inside the room.)

8
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:57,159
(I was drugged
right before the wedding.)

9
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,799
(I was too weak to struggle or resist.)

10
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,159
(It was a plot to frame me
with adultery)

11
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:04,079
(so Lord Ming would divorce me.)

12
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:05,879
You are not Lord Ming.
What do you want?

13
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:07,640
Darn it, she is awake.

14
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:09,640
Help!

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,519
Help me!

16
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,439
(Is this the end
of my miserable wife?)

17
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:18,319
(No, I won't die a dishonorable death.)

18
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,400
(If I could start over,)

19
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,439
(I'd show my younger self)

20
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,200
(how to become stronger.)

21
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:27,920
(I must avenge my unfortunate fate.)

22
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:29,400
Who are you?

23
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:32,879
I know.

24
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:35,159
You life is miserable.

25
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,519
However,

26
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,319
you must study medicine

27
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,879
and lear martial arts

28
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,200
to better protect yourself.

29
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:46,959
Then, no one
can ever mistreat you again.

30
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,079
Can you take me away?

31
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,200
Actually,

32
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,480
I've always been by your side.

33
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,920
(Endure the darkness so you may shine.)

34
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,120
(Endure, no matter
the hardship and suffering.)

35
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,920
You are a hideous jinx.

36
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,840
My mother is
the Prime Minister's wife!

37
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,359
(Whether it's your bullying
step-siblings,

38
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,680
(or the red mark you got
from poisoning)

39
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:08,960
(that was deem a bad omen,)

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,719
(Qu Huiniang, successor wife of Prime Minister)
She can't marry Lord Ming like this.

41
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,080
(Prime Minister Lin)
His Majesty betrothed her to him.

42
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,560
We can't say no to this.

43
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:19,719
(I'll grow strong
like the field of grass)

44
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,800
(and become an adult)

45
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,680
(capable of changing my fate.)

46
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:26,800
(I am me.)

47
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,280
(But I'm not the same
in this lifetime.)

48
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,319
(I must escape
the Prime Minister's Residence)

49
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,080
(and be free of their control.)

50
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,159
Young Lady, the wedding gown is here.

51
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,940
(Yunniang, the bride's personal servant)

52
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,400
Who picked on you this time?

53
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,879
You need not worry.

54
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,879
The Second Lady is
frustrated that she can't

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,039
be Lord Ming's bride.

56
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,520
She took it out on me.

57
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,800
I packed up my belongings.

58
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,000
We must go now.

59
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,479
Now?

60
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,319
Yes, before it's too late.

61
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,560
I am never marrying Lord Ming.

62
00:02:58,719 --> 00:02:59,199
Let's go.

63
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,560
(I never thought)

64
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:07,039
(they anticipated my escape.)

65
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,919
(They drugged me.)

66
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,800
(I can't escape the fate
of marrying Lord Ming.)

67
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,039
(No, it's different this time.)O

68
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,199
(I grew up studying medicine.)

69
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,159
Cursed woman!

70
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:34,960
(They used the same trick
as last time.)

71
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,639
(They tried to ruin my honor)

72
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:37,680
(with this loathsome scheme.)

73
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:41,080
My Lord.

74
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:43,159
Is she married to Lord Ming?

75
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,719
Yes.

76
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,200
(Lie Feng, Lord Ling's guard)
Lord Ling attended the banquet.

77
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:47,159
My Lord.

78
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,520
Are you going to let her
marrying Lord Ming?

79
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:50,560
Aren't you...

80
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,979
(Liang Junye, Lord Ling)
I have my plans.

81
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,439
Ling Chuxia.

82
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,960
How dare you cheat on me
on the day of our wedding?

83
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,240
Cheat?

84
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,240
(Liang Ziyan, Lord Ming)
My Lord, help me.

85
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,520
Miss Ling's urge was too great.

86
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,840
She forced herself on me.

87
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,280
(So, I knew it was your plan.)

88
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,080
Scram!

89
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,399
Shameless woman.

90
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,639
I caught you red-handed.

91
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:20,720
What excuse do you have now?

92
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,959
Guards! Drag her out of here.

93
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,600
Yes!

94
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,560
Fool.

95
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,199
How could you not
see through that trick?

96
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,319
Insolence!

97
00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:32,560
(Ling Qiuqing, concubine's daughter)
How dare you insult Lord Ming?

98
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:35,920
You, come over here.

99
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,759
What do you want?

100
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,399
See?

101
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:48,639
He is a eunuch.

102
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,079
How can we have an affair?

103
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,600
Even the worse fool can see

104
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,360
the reason behind this.

105
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,759
Ling Chuxia, you are...

106
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:58,399
Whatever.

107
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:00,519
Since you clearly hate me,

108
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,480
(Letter of Betrothal)
I'll divorce you right away.

109
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,199
This marriage is null and void.

110
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,639
Ling Chuxia, are you
out of your mind?

111
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,000
You dare divorce me?

112
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,319
No woman has ever divorced
her husband in Great Yue!

113
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,680
Guards! Seize her!

114
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,439
Ziyan.

115
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,079
I hurried to your wedding.

116
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,839
What happened here?

117
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:36,560
(What is Lord Ling doing here?)

118
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,639
Sorry, Lord Ling.

119
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,759
It's a misunderstanding.

120
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:40,759
Really?

121
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,959
All the fuss is
about a misunderstanding?

122
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,480
That could tarnish
the royal family's image.

123
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,759
Lord Ling.

124
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,560
Are you intervening my marriage?

125
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,199
I wonder if you are ready

126
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,040
to explain this
to Prime Minister Ling?

127
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,319
Guards.

128
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,319
Get this eunuch out off here.

129
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:02,959
Yes.

130
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:05,959
- Move!
- Lord Ming, have mercy! I've been set up!

131
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,720
Anyone who dares
speak a word about this

132
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,360
will suffer the same fate.

133
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:14,439
Someone clearly wants to harm the lady.

134
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,560
Lord Ling, I must take my leave now.

135
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,000
I doubt there will be
a wedding afterward.

136
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,600
Lord Ming! Wait for me!

137
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,279
(Why did Lord Ling help me?)

138
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,160
Hideous witch! Jinx!

139
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,639
It pains the Prime Minister
to see this face.

140
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:44,920
You brought death
to your mom and uncle.

141
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,560
(They accused me of adultery)

142
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,279
(and executed me. )

143
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:52,800
(I wanted to preserve my honor
and leave this place,)

144
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:55,399
(but you wouldn't relent.)

145
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,319
(This time,)

146
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,800
(No one can pick on me.)

147
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:01,160
(From now on,)

148
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,000
(I'll return the pain you inflict)

149
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:05,079
(ten times over.)

150
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,160
Young Lady.

151
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,079
I wanted to find you
at Lord Ming's Residence.

152
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,439
Why did you come back?

153
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,079
Did they give you a hard time?

154
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:19,120
(As it turns out,
someone still cares about me.)

155
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:20,560
Sit.

156
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:27,160
I thought they would relent

157
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,079
if I took a step back.

158
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,439
But it looks like

159
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,519
I was dead wrong.

160
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,639
Young Lady,

161
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,720
what do we do next?

162
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,320
(The dowry mother gave me
is still in Lord Ming's Residence.)

163
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,560
(I must retrieve what's mine.)

164
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,480
We'll treat the mark on my face.

165
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,600
They were unkind to me.

166
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,439
I have no need

167
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:51,800
for this mark anymore.

168
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,079
We are leaving.

169
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,959
And we will leave gloriously.
