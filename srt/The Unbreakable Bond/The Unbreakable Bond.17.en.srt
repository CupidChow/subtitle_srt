00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,440
=The Unbreakable Bond=
(Adapted from Xiao A'man's novel)

2
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,020
("After the Ugly Concubine Divorced,
She is Wooed By Big Shots of the Capital.")

3
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,100
=Episode 17=

4
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:46,239
You shouldn't say that, Miss Yu.

5
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,679
Since the beginning of time,
women have had the monthlies.

6
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,179
That's human nature.

7
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,959
It's just like eating and sleeping.

8
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:53,400
It's nothing shameful.

9
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,359
Don't believe in those taboos

10
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:56,840
and end up crippling yourself.

11
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:00,879
Don't worry, I'll think of something.

12
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,559
Waiter.

13
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,799
Go to the nearest clothing store
and buy a coat.

14
00:01:20,139 --> 00:01:21,439
The gameplay is a mess.

15
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:23,799
The past is but a dream.

16
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,978
Only sighs remain.

17
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,439
Not just sighs.

18
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:29,680
What happened back then

19
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,400
will surely come to a head.

20
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,680
I only wish Chuxia not to be hurt again.

21
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,320
To be happy.

22
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:39,040
With me here,

23
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:40,880
she will be.

24
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,099
Luoluo, there's something I have to do.

25
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,120
I have to go now.

26
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,559
(There's no news from Liefeng.)

27
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,120
(Did something happen?)

28
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:53,240
(I guess I'll have to go
to the Prime Minister's Residence.)

29
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,120
Chuxia.

30
00:01:55,419 --> 00:01:57,919
Thank you for your help today.

31
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,999
I'll make a trip to
the General's Residence soon,

32
00:02:00,059 --> 00:02:02,880
and show you the new designs
for my embroidered handkerchiefs.

33
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:05,320
You're welcome. See you soon.

34
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,739
Don't stop me.

35
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,899
Have you never wondered
how a housebound woman like Madam Qu

36
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,679
could have such remarkable capabilities?

37
00:02:25,619 --> 00:02:29,000
Are you saying that
there's someone controlling her?

38
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,058
I don't want you to endanger yourself.

39
00:02:33,059 --> 00:02:34,760
I'm not letting you
put yourself in danger.

40
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:35,959
Step aside.

41
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,079
If you hadn't given me
the porridge back then,

42
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,760
I would've died from hunger.

43
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,119
I even bit you.

44
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,839
I had been looking for you
all these years.

45
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,679
I only know that you're a daughter
of an official,

46
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,320
but I didn't know which family.

47
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:52,720
You're the little boy at Yuyao Pass?

48
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,239
At the time, a Shuhuang person

49
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:56,338
captured numerous young beggars
during the chaos

50
00:02:56,339 --> 00:02:57,760
and tied us up.

51
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,359
I managed to survive

52
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:00,778
and never thought I'd see you again.

53
00:03:00,779 --> 00:03:02,239
Since you're indebted to me,

54
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,098
why won't you tell me

55
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:05,560
who's instructing Madam Qu?

56
00:03:05,779 --> 00:03:07,119
You won't be able to beat him.

57
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:08,699
You should give it up.

58
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,119
Yunniang's safety
trumps everything else.

59
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,079
I won't be able to help her on my own.

60
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:19,359
I need to go see him.

61
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:24,760
Yunniang.

62
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:26,760
Yunniang.

63
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:27,799
Yunniang!

64
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,119
Yunniang.

65
00:03:31,059 --> 00:03:32,079
Yunniang!

66
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,239
You've suffered.

67
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:13,399
I vow to avenge you.

68
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:21,978
Liefeng.

69
00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:23,639
Wake up, Liefeng!

70
00:04:24,099 --> 00:04:25,279
Miss Chuxia.

71
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,760
There.

72
00:04:27,219 --> 00:04:28,159
Liefeng.

73
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,519
Watch over Yunniang's body for me.

74
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,200
Is Your Highness
looking for Ling Chuxia?

75
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,218
You dare appear before me again?

76
00:04:40,219 --> 00:04:41,839
I suppose you have a death wish.

77
00:04:44,179 --> 00:04:45,658
As it stands, Your Highness should focus

78
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:47,079
on Ling Chuxia's safety instead.

79
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,579
The Prime Minister's Residence
is heavily guarded.

80
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,738
Ling Chuxia ignored my warnings

81
00:04:50,739 --> 00:04:51,978
and snuck into the grounds.

82
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:53,978
If Your Highness
doesn't make a move now,

83
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:55,360
you'll likely be collecting a body.

84
00:04:55,539 --> 00:04:58,000
Also, your dim-witted bodyguard
is there, too.

85
00:04:58,779 --> 00:04:59,519
Let's go.

86
00:05:06,859 --> 00:05:09,440
Ling Chuxia, you dare show up!

87
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,880
I'm going to beat you to death!

88
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,560
What are you doing?

89
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:13,760
Step back.

90
00:05:14,099 --> 00:05:15,360
Or else I'll kill her.

91
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:16,379
Do as she says.

92
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,059
I'm my mother's only daughter.

93
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,579
If anything happens to me,

94
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,479
my mother will not spare you all!

95
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,379
(Prime Minister's Residence)

96
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,418
Your Highness.

97
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:29,259
You show up here unannounced
with a group of men.

98
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,418
Is there a problem?

99
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:31,259
Where is Ling Chuxia?

100
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,240
Chuxia?

101
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,159
Chuxia didn't come back.

102
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,700
(Prime Minister's Residence)

103
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,440
Stand your ground!

104
00:05:42,219 --> 00:05:43,719
I'll have her head today!

105
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:51,959
Get her!

106
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,680
Chuxia!

107
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,680
Are you alright?

108
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,279
I'm okay.

109
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:03,139
Kill that woman!

110
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,079
No!

111
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,699
Huiniang, what are you doing?

112
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,499
Who are you, really?

113
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,839
Who am I?

114
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,658
I am none other than your,

115
00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:17,159
Prime Minister Ling Feng's
legal wife, Qu Huiniang.

116
00:06:18,299 --> 00:06:20,939
As well as a pawn sent by Shuhuang.

117
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,200
You are a Shuhuang native?

118
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:26,200
That's right.

119
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,819
I'm from Shuhuang.

120
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,399
I just didn't expect

121
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:31,760
it would come to this so soon.

122
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:34,800
How could that be?

123
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:36,800
Mother, you're lying.

124
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,320
This can't be true.

125
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,440
My only regret is
not killing Ling Chuxia.

126
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:42,939
Because of that,

127
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,680
the troublemaker
caused your little brother's death.

128
00:06:45,179 --> 00:06:46,338
Arrest her!

129
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,200
Wait.

130
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:51,560
I want to ask her something.

131
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,560
I'm the person you're after.

132
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,519
Why did you kill Yunniang?

133
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:01,019
That stupid maid, Yunniang.

134
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,738
She just had to lure you to your death.

135
00:07:02,739 --> 00:07:04,200
She served her purpose.

136
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,200
You're wicked.

137
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:11,000
Who is giving you orders?

138
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,019
No one is giving me orders.

139
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,279
I'm the one who wants you dead!

140
00:07:21,299 --> 00:07:24,159
I will wait for you in hell.

141
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,819
Mother.

142
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,680
Mother!

143
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,959
Huiniang.

144
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,440
Huiniang...

145
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:39,760
Chuxia.

146
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:44,719
Liang Junye.

147
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,079
Hush.

148
00:07:46,179 --> 00:07:47,440
I'm taking you back.

149
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,839
I should've gone with you.

150
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,959
You wouldn't have gotten hurt, then.

151
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,839
It's my fault.

152
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,399
Chuxia. Chuxia!

153
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:04,920
Chuxia!

154
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,920
What happened?

155
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,360
Lord Ling.

156
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:11,178
You promised me

157
00:08:11,179 --> 00:08:13,159
that you'd keep Chuxia safe.

158
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,120
Is this what you meant
by safe and sound?

159
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:18,320
I agreed to let you stay
at the General's Residence

160
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:20,738
because I thought
you'd be Chuxia's support.

161
00:08:20,739 --> 00:08:22,360
That you'd keep her safe and happy.

162
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,079
Seems like I was wrong about you.

163
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,719
De, see the guest out.

164
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:30,240
Liefeng.

165
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,520
Chuxia.

166
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,320
Chuxia, you're awake.

167
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,959
Yue.

168
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:56,800
