4
00:00:45,699 --> 00:00:47,639
Too many things have happened lately.

5
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,720
Liang Junye,

6
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,938
have you forgotten

7
00:00:51,939 --> 00:00:53,520
that we have a serious matter at hand?

8
00:00:54,339 --> 00:00:55,018
You were bedridden.

9
00:00:55,019 --> 00:00:56,480
I couldn't think of anything else.

10
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,639
I meant, I had too many official tasks.

11
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,480
I had no time to go search.

12
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,639
Great Yue's lackadaisical prince.

13
00:01:10,059 --> 00:01:13,120
Since when has he bothered
with official tasks?

14
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:16,719
What?

15
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:18,919
Did you find new clues?

16
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,480
I turned the mansion upside down,

17
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,519
but I was unable to find anything.

18
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,279
I'm not sure where the clue you said

19
00:01:27,699 --> 00:01:28,999
is hidden.

20
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,359
Where is everybody?

21
00:01:34,499 --> 00:01:35,359
Yue?

22
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:37,040
De?

23
00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:44,418
Liang Junye.

24
00:01:44,419 --> 00:01:46,159
Chuxia, let Lord Ling go.

25
00:01:46,699 --> 00:01:47,799
What's going on?

26
00:01:50,139 --> 00:01:51,079
Ling Chuxia,

27
00:01:51,419 --> 00:01:53,519
we're here especially
to celebrate your birthday.

28
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,899
Even if you're the birthday girl,

29
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,400
you shouldn't treat us like this.

30
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,600
I actually forgot about it.

31
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,819
It's my birthday today.

32
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,498
It's my cousin Chuxia's birthday.

33
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:05,600
Of course I have to give you
a proper celebration.

34
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,200
Yue,

35
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:14,119
we can keep the celebration
within the family.

36
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,480
Why did you invite an outsider?

37
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,139
Okay, okay.

38
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,699
I came without being invited.

39
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,200
It was rash of me.

40
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:26,079
Lord Ling was adamant about staying.

41
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,600
There was nothing I could do.

42
00:02:30,779 --> 00:02:32,160
Where's my birthday present?

43
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,320
Don't worry.

44
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:38,399
I'm sure you'll be pleased
with my gift.

45
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,859
After you eat this longevity noodles,

46
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,119
may your life be as long and blessed.

47
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,519
Thank you, Yue.

48
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,119
De,

49
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,399
come and sit down.

50
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,919
You too, Liefeng.

51
00:02:54,059 --> 00:02:54,919
Chuxia.

52
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,818
I know you like unusual things.

53
00:02:57,819 --> 00:02:59,880
I specifically asked the Princess
to find this for you.

54
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,839
I hope you like it.

55
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,280
It's a jewelry box.

56
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,320
Princess Ziyuan sure has lovely taste.

57
00:03:08,779 --> 00:03:11,480
Guess I'll have to buy more ornaments.

58
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:13,179
Chuxia,

59
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,040
why don't you open it first.

60
00:03:17,779 --> 00:03:19,160
I believe your set of needles

61
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,019
was given to you by Grandmother, right?

62
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,679
I specially selected a new set for you.

63
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,720
Take a look.

64
00:03:33,779 --> 00:03:35,639
What beautiful gold needles.

65
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,179
Thank you, Yue.

66
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,259
I love it.

67
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,359
I'm glad.

68
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:42,359
Miss,

69
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,839
this is a little trinket
I saw on the street.

70
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,320
I hope you don't mind it.

71
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,760
Thank you, De.

72
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,699
My Lord has prepared a present

73
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,839
for Miss Chuxia, too.

74
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm unable to present

75
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:58,160
the gift here.

76
00:04:04,059 --> 00:04:05,040
Liang Junye.

77
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,259
How big is the present

78
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,480
that we have to come here?

79
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,440
Aren't Yue and the others coming?

80
00:04:11,499 --> 00:04:13,280
I prepared it especially for you.

81
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:15,040
It's very small.

82
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,039
So small that it could fit in your eyes.

83
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,819
(General's Residence)

84
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,858
That's Lord Ling's signal.

85
00:04:31,859 --> 00:04:32,959
Quick, get moving.

86
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,778
The men waited for too long

87
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:36,959
and... and took a bathroom break.

Is there a deeper meaning
to the finger snaps?

92
00:04:56,779 --> 00:04:58,240
Those useless bums.

93
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,959
Ling Chuxia, I...

94
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,959
Such beautiful fireworks.

on this auspicious day.

Ling Chuxia,

100
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,839
happy birthday.

101
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,519
Liang Junye,

102
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:35,519
thank you.

103
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,200
I haven't seen fireworks
for a long time.

104
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,120
The last time was during my 7th birthday

105
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,159
at Yuyao Pass.

106
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:49,039
I had a fight with my mother.

107
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,800
So my uncles set off fireworks
at the city wall to cheer me up.

108
00:05:55,739 --> 00:05:57,079
The fireworks that night

109
00:05:57,779 --> 00:05:59,440
were as beautiful as tonight's.

110
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,599
So you still remember.

111
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,800
What did you say?

112
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:07,240
Nothing.

113
00:06:08,299 --> 00:06:09,719
I was just thinking of a past memory.

114
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,599
Chuxia.

115
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,159
I have something else to tell you.

116
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,760
What is it?

117
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,680
I admit that I at first,
I approached you

118
00:06:23,739 --> 00:06:24,920
for an ulterior motive.

119
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,218
I was investigating

120
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:28,719
the Yuyao Pass incident.

121
00:06:28,859 --> 00:06:29,760
I know.

122
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,440
You don't have to explain more.

123
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,079
That's not all.

124
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:36,839
From the moment I saw you,

125
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:38,839
I've been attracted to you.

126
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:42,440
Later, we experienced hardships
and dangers together,

127
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,440
we overcame death.

128
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:48,000
Since then, I've not
been able to control my feelings.

129
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,880
In the past, I used to think

130
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,200
that love and desire
would blind a person.

131
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:56,920
Moreover,

132
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,959
when it's the desire
to protect your loved one.

133
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:03,760
But now, for you,

134
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:05,440
I am willing to take that gamble.

135
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:08,159
Ling Chuxia,

136
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,519

147
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,800
me summoning you?

148
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,760
Some people,

149
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,360
even when they're near,

150
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,000
your heart still pines for that person.

151
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,079
I've always liked to be free,

Liang Yejun,

155
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:12,920
I too,

156
00:08:14,299 --> 00:08:15,440
am willing

157
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:18,599

Are you going back to your residence?

162
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:36,640
I haven't fully recovered yet.

163
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:38,440
I'd like to stay a few more days.

164
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,899

Cousin?

00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:45,040
You sure changed
the appellation quickly.

Back then, you were
Grandfather's favorite.

When the Emperor
set Chuxia up for marriage,

169

he immediately chose you.
