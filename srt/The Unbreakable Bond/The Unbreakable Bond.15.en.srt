=The Unbreakable Bond=
(Adapted from Xiao A'man's novel)

2
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,960
("After the Ugly Concubine Divorced,
She is Wooed By Big Shots of the Capital.")

3
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,000
=Episode 15=

4
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,359
Time is up!

5
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:51,298
The results are out.

6
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:52,578
The two participants
in the winning team

7
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:54,720
have to answer one extra question.

8
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,599
The one who answers it first
will be the final winner.

9
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,279
Interesting.

10
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,959
If so,

11
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:03,120
please give us the extra riddle, sir.

12
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,079
The mountains are dyed yellow
by the autumn foliage.

13
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,760
The Qing magistrate accumulates
a mountain of silver.

14
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,799
Do you know the answer?

15
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,960
A bell.

16
00:01:25,059 --> 00:01:26,079
It's a bell.

17
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,159
First Young Lady Ling
got the answer first.

18
00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:31,899
You are our champion this year.

19
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,880
Good one!

20
00:01:35,419 --> 00:01:36,359
That was great.

21
00:01:36,419 --> 00:01:37,320
Bring it over.

22
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,539
Assassin!

23
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,379
- Liang Junye!
- Chuxia!

24
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:49,698
Chuxia!

25
00:01:49,699 --> 00:01:50,418
- Lord Ling!
- Chuxia!

26
00:01:50,419 --> 00:01:51,299
- Liang Junye!
- Chuxia!

27
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,058
Get a doctor!

28
00:01:52,059 --> 00:01:53,439
Why did you do that?

29
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,159
Are you stupid?

30
00:01:56,619 --> 00:02:00,279
This time is because
I'm indebted to you.

31
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,719
Junye.

32
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:05,880
Junye!

33
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,439
Junye!

34
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,799
Thankfully, the injury is not fatal

35
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:12,959
and Uncle survived.

36
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,200
Now we just have to pray
that he wakes up.

37
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:18,000
Lord Ling's actions

38
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,519
showed how much
he cares about you, Chuxia.

39
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,399
Lord Ling risked his life to save me.

40
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,959
I have to make it up to him.

41
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,200
Liefeng went to look for Yunniang
and hasn't returned.

42
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,600
De.

43
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:37,200
I'll have to trouble you
to fetch the medicine.

44
00:02:38,339 --> 00:02:40,959
Feed it to Lord Ling once he wakes up.

45
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,440
Yes, Miss Ling.

46
00:02:44,059 --> 00:02:44,959
Yue.

47
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,498
I was going to use the Blazing Kirin
I just won

48
00:02:48,499 --> 00:02:49,839
to treat your legs.

49
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,919
But now,

50
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:55,338
we'll have to wait
till after Lord Ling wakes up.

51
00:02:55,339 --> 00:02:56,320
That's fine.

52
00:02:57,099 --> 00:02:59,040
Since you've already obtained
the Blazing Kirin,

53
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,040
you should look after Lord Ling first.

54
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,239
We'll take our leave.

55
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,818
I didn't see Yunniang
at Baicao Apothecary.

56
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,320
Nor is she at the tea house.

57
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:29,839
Where did Yunniang go?

58
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,079
Liang Junye.

59
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,200
Do not for once think
that blocking the attack for me

60
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,880
means the marriage proposal is real.

61
00:03:42,339 --> 00:03:45,000
It's not that easy
to get involved with me.

62
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,639
The wishes we made before,

63
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:54,880
we still have to go back
and give our thanks.

64
00:04:00,619 --> 00:04:01,579
Let's go and make a wish.

65
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,639
What wish?

66
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,160
De.

67
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,280
Look after Lord Ling for me.

68
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:11,320
I have to step out for a bit.

69
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:14,119
Are your legs going to be cured soon?

70
00:04:15,059 --> 00:04:16,000
Perhaps.

71
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:18,639
I've yet to thank you.

72
00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:20,479
Thank me for what?

73
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:22,800
I know.

74
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:24,920
If not for you, Princess,

75
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,959
Chuxia couldn't have gotten
the Blazing Kirin.

76
00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:30,360
And I wouldn't have believed
my legs could be cured.

77
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,680
There's no need
to be so courteous with me.

78
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,800
As long as you get my sentiment.

79
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,320
Your sentiment...

80
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,200
I'm afraid I'm unable to reciprocate.

81
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,880
What do you mean by that?

82
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,320
I regard you only as my pupil
learning chess.

83
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,360
Nothing more.

84
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:52,760
If you already knew,

85
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:54,560
why do you pretend to be unaware?

86
00:04:54,859 --> 00:04:55,978
The gap between us

87
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:57,760
is like heaven and earth.

88
00:04:57,859 --> 00:04:59,019
We're clearly unmatched.

89
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,279
I don't care about that.

90
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,059
Now, your legs are going to recover.

91
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,920
- I'll go back and ask my father...
- Princess.

92
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,760
Even if my legs are well again,

93
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,279
I'm not going to have
any relation with you.

94
00:05:11,219 --> 00:05:14,000
Do you mean that?

95
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,079
Every word.

96
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:23,320
Sorry for my intrusion.

97
00:05:31,859 --> 00:05:33,680
Even if my legs are well,

98
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,560
I'm still the son of a criminal.

99
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,959
I can't bear having you
condescend by marrying me

100
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,360
and suffer the harshness of reality.

101
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:02,079
(I pray for
the Sacred Tree's protection.)

102
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,760
(Please let Lord Ling wake up soon,)

103
00:06:05,179 --> 00:06:06,519
(healthy and well.)

104
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,279
(May her wish come true.)

105
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:36,599
(Liang Junye.)

106
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,279
Luoluo.

107
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,320
I can't believe what happened.

108
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,858
I will find out

109
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:54,320
where the assassin came from.

110
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,218
Miss Chuxia is a straightforward person

111
00:06:58,219 --> 00:06:59,360
who likes to help others.

112
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:02,899
Perhaps, after leaving
the Prime Minister's Residence,

113
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,440
she unknowingly offended someone

114
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,560
and made an enemy.

115
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,039
Investigating the matter
might be difficult.

116
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,320
However,

117
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,240
I think

118
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:17,479
this is a new opportunity
for Your Highness.

119
00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:20,079
You can use the incident as a reason

120
00:07:20,219 --> 00:07:22,240
to visit the General's Residence often

121
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,079
and check on Miss Chuxia's well-being.

122
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,200
You're right.

123
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,560
That makes sense.

124
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,399
I'll have to think about

125
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,680
what to gift Chuxia.

126
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,839
Chuxia.

127
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,939
Why didn't you tell me that you're
participating in the riddles contest

128
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,079
because you wanted to win
the Blazing Kirin to treat my legs?

129
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:44,479
I want to tell you.

130
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,159
You mustn't risk your own safety
for my sake again.

131
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,360
Yue,

132
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,839
that was purely an accident.

133
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:53,000
I didn't know someone
was trying to kill me.

134
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,560
You were in danger because of me.

135
00:07:54,859 --> 00:07:56,240
The only thing I wish for

136
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,440
is that you're unharmed.

137
00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:01,760
I believe the incident at
the riddles contest tonight

138
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,839
was aimed at me.

139
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,599
I'm going to find out what happened.

140
00:08:06,299 --> 00:08:09,279
I won't have Lord Ling
suffer the stab for nothing.

141
00:08:10,739 --> 00:08:11,560
Yue,

142
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:13,519
I'm going to check on Lord Ling.
