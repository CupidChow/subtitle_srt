Junye.

5
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,959
Have our wishes come true?

6
00:00:55,339 --> 00:00:57,120
Is there anything else unfulfilled?

7
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:00,040
Anything else?

8
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,160
That will depend on you.

9
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:04,080
What?

10
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,240
Did you forget what I wished for?

11
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,079
"May her wish come true."

12
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,020
♪The one and only you♪

13
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:50,680
Are you really leaving?

14
00:01:50,779 --> 00:01:52,240
The matter has been resolved.

15
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,919
I had promised to be your weapon
to protect you.

16
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,480
But now,

17
00:01:56,619 --> 00:01:58,559
you have Lord Ling.

18
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,279
Chuxia.

19
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:05,240
This is my first time calling you that,
and probably the last time, too.

20
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,439
You know what?

21
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,399
Before, the world in my heart

22
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,919
only seemed wonderful when

23
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:12,200
I was with you.

24
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,760
I've been restrained for too long,

25
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,160
so I'm letting it all go.

26
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,400
I'm going to travel
around the vast world.

27
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,600
I think being a carefree wanderer

28
00:02:20,619 --> 00:02:22,000
is not a bad idea.

29
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:25,079
Although there are some regrets,

30
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,280
not everything can work out perfect
all the time.

31
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,280
Regrets can be wonderful, too.

32
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,040
Jiang Li,

33
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:39,600
I hope you'll be able
to be your true self.

34
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,280
Live a happy life.

35
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,058
I heard the emperor prepared
a treasured item

36
00:02:55,059 --> 00:02:56,259
as the top prize

37
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,839
for the lantern riddles contest.

38
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,399
Treasured item?

39
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:01,320
More reason for me to take part.

40
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,079
Can lovers really have happy endings?

41
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:14,359
Looks like I'll have to get rid of you.

42
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,459
(General's Residence)

43
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,280
Yue,

44
00:03:29,619 --> 00:03:30,979
I'm leaving for good this time.

45
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,320
I will write to you.

46
00:03:32,499 --> 00:03:34,359
If you're tired of officialdom,

47
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,519
come and visit.

48
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,259
The General's Residence
will always be your home.

49
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,760
You're welcome to come back any time.

50
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,658
Words can't express my feelings.
Do take care.

51
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:43,239
I'm sure you all will meet again.

52
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,480
Chuxia.

53
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,618
I hope to be like you,

54
00:03:45,619 --> 00:03:47,079
be more easygoing.

55
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,880
Princess Ziyuan,

56
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:54,000
please take good care of my cousin.

57
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:56,880
I feel better knowing you're here.

58
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,560
There are many things
to do in the palace.

59
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,519
I may not have the time
to come to the General's Residence.

60
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,859
(General's Residence)

61
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,760
Mr. Baili,

62
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,280
see you again.

63
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,660
(General's Residence)

64
00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:25,159
After today,

65
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,920
are you really not coming
for chess lessons again?

66
00:04:30,859 --> 00:04:31,719
Well...

67
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:34,240
Shall we play one last game?

68
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:36,560
Okay.

69
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,560
This is...

70
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,039
the game that I wasn't able to beat.

71
00:05:14,299 --> 00:05:15,579
With this move,

72
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,639
I'm going to be the winner.

73
00:05:32,739 --> 00:05:33,560
Princess,

74
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:36,039
in the few years I've taught you,

75
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,399
I've never lost.

76
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,000
Now I realize.

77
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,800
I've been losing to my own pride.

78
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:44,320
Now I wish to win.

79
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:47,920
I wish to win the chance
to spend my days with you.

80
00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:52,560
Looks like

81
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,920
I still lost this game.

82
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,379
(One year later)

83
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,159
Everyone,

84
00:06:05,179 --> 00:06:07,200
no more idle talk,
let's get back to the main story.

85
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:09,858
Empress Yu turned from a beautiful lady

86
00:06:09,859 --> 00:06:12,538
to a wrinkly, old hag
in the blink of an eye.

87
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:13,218
Then,

88
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:15,298
the emperor ordered
the named General Baili

89
00:06:15,299 --> 00:06:16,019
as the commander

90
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,579
in the attack against Shuhuang.

91
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,459
And thus, the world was unified.

92
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,800
Good, good!

93
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,599
Hang on.

94
00:06:22,739 --> 00:06:24,019
Is the General Baili,

95
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,338
the same one

96
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:26,800
that married Princess Ziyuan?

97
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:28,399
In Great Yue,

98
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,159
is there another General Baili?

99
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,778
What happened to Lord Ling
and First Young Lady Ling?

100
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:33,579
Yeah.

101
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,819
Rumor has it that they moved
to the countryside,

102
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,899
living simply.

103
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,680
They're enjoying a quiet life.

104
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,279
Slow down.

105
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,200
I'm not that fragile.

106
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:49,839
I was wrong.

107
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:53,240
I forgot, there's nothing
my wife can't handle.

108
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,760
It's summer again.

109
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,360
Are you reminding me

110
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,760
that your birthday is coming up soon?

111
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,320
It's the second birthday
we're spending together.

112
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,000
Did you prepare a present?

113
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,778
It's not our second one.

114
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:16,920
It's the third.

115
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:21,959
Why are you crying?

116
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,880
Did someone bully you?

117
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,360
I'm not crying.

118
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,379
If you keep crouching in this corner,

119
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,418
you'll miss out on the fireworks later.

120
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,760
Fireworks? There's fireworks tonight?

121
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,098
See? I didn't lie to you.

122
00:07:43,099 --> 00:07:44,360
So don't cry.

123
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:47,440
I'll play with you in the future.

124
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,399
Chuxia.

125
00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:29,599
You said

126
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,479
that when two people are in love,

127
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,640
they need not care
about what others think.

128
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,640
When there is love,

129
00:08:35,939 --> 00:08:38,040
you need not bother with red tapes.

130
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,578
I wish to give you

131
00:08:39,579 --> 00:08:40,999
a wedding that belongs only to us.

132
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,200
It's what I owe you,

133
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:46,119
and also the third birthday present.

134
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:48,119
You weren't the one before,

135
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,560
but thankfully you're the one
in the end.

136
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:53,719
You're the one in my future.

137
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:56,800
And I hope you're the one
in all my lifetimes.

138
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:57,999
Junye.

139
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,400
Thank you for making all the beautiful things
I've been looking forward to come true.

140
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,839
Bad news, my lord.

141
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,640
The emperor is dead. The ministers
are waiting for your to take the throne.

142
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,178
