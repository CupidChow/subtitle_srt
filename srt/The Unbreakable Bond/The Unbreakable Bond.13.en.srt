=The Unbreakable Bond=
(Adapted from Xiao A'man's novel)

2
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,960
("After the Ugly Concubine Divorced,
She is Wooed By Big Shots of the Capital.")

3
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,000
=Episode 13=

4
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,919
I mean, Uncle and Chuxia
didn't have any interaction before.

5
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:49,779
So how did they become besotted?

6
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,400
He even proposed to her.

7
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,859
From what you just said,

8
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,599
it seems more like Miss Ling
and Lord Ling

9
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,359
secretly coordinated
and put on a show for you.

10
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:01,999
Don't lie to me.

11
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:04,080
Think about it, Your Highness.

12
00:01:04,139 --> 00:01:06,600
If they never had any interaction,

13
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,519
how could it be so coincidental

14
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:10,799
that he was there at the same time
to propose to her?

15
00:01:11,139 --> 00:01:13,079
It means they had planned it beforehand.

16
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,179
They were waiting for you to show up

17
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,919
and used it as a reason to reject you.

18
00:01:18,699 --> 00:01:20,058
You're as capable as ever.

19
00:01:20,059 --> 00:01:21,480
It totally makes sense now.

20
00:01:22,059 --> 00:01:24,159
Tonight is the Lantern Festival.

21
00:01:24,339 --> 00:01:26,880
Perhaps Chuxia will attend.

22
00:01:27,419 --> 00:01:29,618
Why don't we go try our luck, too?

23
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:31,320
Good idea.

24
00:01:31,339 --> 00:01:33,200
I love solving lantern riddles.

25
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,559
If Chuxia is there,

26
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,200
I'm going to show her my wit and charm.

27
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:41,760
Let's go.

28
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:10,280
(I'm glad I've been
watching out for you.)

29
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:13,359
Did you call for me?

30
00:02:22,339 --> 00:02:24,880
Would you like to go
to a quieter place with me?

31
00:02:27,339 --> 00:02:28,160
Okay.

32
00:02:33,499 --> 00:02:35,160
What a beautiful spot.

33
00:02:40,499 --> 00:02:41,399
Well?

34
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:42,880
You believe it now?

35
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,959
I just accidentally dropped it.

36
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:48,679
As long as the jade bell rings,

37
00:02:48,779 --> 00:02:50,079
I will take it as your summoning me.

38
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:51,579
I...

39
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,200
I didn't think you'd be interested
in the Lantern Festival.

40
00:02:54,619 --> 00:02:56,119
I thought you didn't like crowds.

41
00:02:58,059 --> 00:02:59,919
I'm here for something else.

42
00:03:00,619 --> 00:03:01,560
What is it?

43
00:03:02,659 --> 00:03:03,299
I'm not obliged

44
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,639
to report every little thing to you.

45
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,679
I was summoned by you.

46
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,600
If you don't tell me what it is,

47
00:03:10,619 --> 00:03:11,880
how am I to assist?

48
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,519
I came to win
the lantern riddles contest

49
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,560
and obtain the Blazing Kirin.

50
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,000
Blazing Kirin?

51
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,959
That's a pricey item.

52
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,440
Why do you need it?

53
00:03:30,779 --> 00:03:32,560
I need it to cure Yue's legs.

54
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,160
I see.

55
00:03:36,779 --> 00:03:37,720
It's perfect, then.

56
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,778
Solving lantern riddles
is my strong suit.

57
00:03:39,779 --> 00:03:42,399
Do you require my assistance, miss?

58
00:03:44,619 --> 00:03:45,720
It's okay.

59
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:49,280
I will win it with my own power.

60
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:50,399
Okay.

61
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,720
I'll take you to a place.

62
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,440
It can grant you your wish.

63
00:03:57,219 --> 00:03:58,079
Where's that?

64
00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:04,200
Is this the place
where your wish will be granted?

65
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,160
There was a large crowd here last year.

66
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,200
How come it's...

67
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,778
Let's go and make a wish.

68
00:04:13,779 --> 00:04:14,919
What wish?

69
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:19,079
For instance, you could wish
to win the contest.

70
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:22,839
I've memorized several
books on lantern riddles.

71
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,360
I don't need to make a wish to win.

72
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,039
However,

73
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,599
if I'm able to get the gods' blessings,

74
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,120
I'm happy to wish.

75
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,519
Let's do it, then.

76
00:04:35,739 --> 00:04:36,519
Boss.

77
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,920
Sir, this is too much.

78
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:40,839
Here, this is for you.

79
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,039
Thanks.

80
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,599
We only need two strips.

81
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,560
One wish is good enough.

82
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,259
Do you want to know

83
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,320
what I wished for?

84
00:05:10,859 --> 00:05:12,039
Not at all.

85
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:13,959
But I want to know yours.

86
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,980
(I hope Yue recovers soon)

87
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:21,279
Ling Chuxia.

88
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,920
Your handwriting is awful.

89
00:05:31,859 --> 00:05:33,259
It's a festive night.

90
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,019
Are you really staying at home, Mr. Baili?

91
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,320
Won't you go out for a stroll?

92
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:38,399
I don't supposed you came

93
00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:40,699
to play a game of chess with me, right?

94
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,619
I came to invite you

95
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,019
to attend the lantern riddles event.

96
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,338
Go and join in the fun.

97
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:46,279
I...

98
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,939
I'm going to pass.

99
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,519
Staying indoors too long
is not good for the mind.

100
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,479
Well then...

101
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,519
De,

102
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,800
keep watch at the mansion.

103
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,959
I will take a quick stroll
with the princess.

104
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,839
Mr. Baili,

105
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,519
the riddles contest is much
more fun than staying at home, no?

106
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,079
Definitely.

107
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,800
I heard from De

108
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:18,200
that Chuxia will be taking part
in the contest, too.

109
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,680
But with you here,

110
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:22,440
I'm afraid she'd be knocked down a peg.

111
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,800
Young Lady Ling is smart.

112
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,298
In my opinion,

113
00:06:26,299 --> 00:06:28,560
she might just emerge
as the winner tonight.

114
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,079
I've never heard you
praise someone else like that.

115
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,920
Your Highness is too kind.

116
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:39,680
Baili Yue?

117
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,159
It's time.

118
00:06:49,299 --> 00:06:50,200
We should go.

119
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,200
Wait.

120
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:55,259
I asked Yunniang to go
to Baicao Apothecary

121
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,320
to get the herbs for Yue's treatment.

122
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,479
It's late.

123
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,159
How come she's not back yet?

124
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:04,000
The lantern riddles contest
is starting soon.

125
00:07:04,179 --> 00:07:05,800
I'll get Liefeng to look for her.

126
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:07,738
Let's head there first.

127
00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:08,959
It should be fine.

128
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,159
Maybe it was too hot on the way back

129
00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:17,519
and she went to get a drink somewhere.

130
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,760
One more thing.

131
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:22,399
Later when we're at the venue,

132
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,399
we'll split up

133
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,680
and enter separately.

134
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,959
Why?

135
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,479
If you and I go in together,

136
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,200
it might spark unwanted rumors.

137
00:07:35,739 --> 00:07:37,240
I helped stop Ziyan for you

138
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,360
and now you're asking me
to keep a distance?

139
00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:43,800
You and I are unrelated.

140
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:45,599
We're not engaged to each other.

141
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:47,279
It's only right to keep a distance.

142
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,920
What if Ziyan is also
at the lantern riddles event?

143
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,000
What will you do then?

144
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,200
Then...

145
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,959
I'll figure it out, then.
You're good at acting anyway.

146
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,599
I will accomplish the job
my lord tasked me.

147
00:08:26,299 --> 00:08:28,399
Isn't that Madam Qu?

148
00:08:29,179 --> 00:08:30,880
