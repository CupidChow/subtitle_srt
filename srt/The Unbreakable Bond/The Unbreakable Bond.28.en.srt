=The Unbreakable Bond=
(Adapted from Xiao A'man's novel)

2
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,020
("After the Ugly Concubine Divorced,
She is Wooed By Big Shots of the Capital.")

3
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,100
=Episode 28=

4
00:00:45,339 --> 00:00:47,499
I heard Miss Chuxia
is going back to her hometown,

5
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,800
so I came to see her off.

6
00:00:49,019 --> 00:00:50,319
Has she left?

7
00:00:50,339 --> 00:00:52,160
Yes, she has.

8
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:54,319
This was unexpected.

9
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,520
She's indeed a carefree person.

10
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,599
She decided to leave and left.

11
00:00:59,339 --> 00:01:02,160
I have an inkling that she'll be back.

12
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,299
One day, I'd like to leave
the palace, too.

13
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,680
Go outside and take a look.

14
00:01:07,779 --> 00:01:09,400
Will you go with me?

15
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,359
When you've been locked up in a cage,

16
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:14,240
freedom tastes that much sweeter.

17
00:01:19,059 --> 00:01:20,279
- My lord.
- My lord.

18
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,760
They have the Shuhuang mark.

19
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,819
I've retired from officialdom.

20
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,719
Why won't they let me go?

21
00:01:51,699 --> 00:01:53,618
To be frank, I knew a long time ago

22
00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:55,760
that Preceptor Yu had evil intentions

23
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,519
and colluded with Shuhuang.

24
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,519
But Preceptor Yu had a secret

25
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,279
no one in Yue knew about.

26
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,519
Yuzheng was a Shuhuang native.

27
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,818
Back then, Lord Hong pushed
for the unification of Shuhuang.

28
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,280
To stop it from happening,

29
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:19,480
Yu Zheng secretly conspired
the Yuyao Pass incident.

30
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,019
Lord Ling was still very young

31
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,218
and had a lot of potential.

32
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:25,839
People thought he'd inherit the throne.

33
00:02:26,499 --> 00:02:27,760
But alas,

34
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,280
things didn't go as planned.

35
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:31,919
If not for the incident,

36
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:34,019
the person you're betrothed to

37
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,639
would've been him.

38
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,760
Did he have anything to do

39
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,058
with the Yuyao Pass incident?

40
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:51,399
He was but a kid then.

41
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,560
If he hadn't been deluded
by Yu Zheng,

42
00:02:53,619 --> 00:02:56,760
he couldn't have been able
to open the city gates.

43
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,880
Jiang Li.

44
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,280
Escort Father back.

45
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,079
Yes, miss.

46
00:03:06,499 --> 00:03:08,019
Chuxia, where are you going?

47
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,899
Back to the capital, to Liang Junye.

48
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,040
Be careful!

49
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:15,200
(Liang Junye.)

50
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,000
(Why didn't you tell me?)

51
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,498
My lord,

52
00:03:23,499 --> 00:03:24,139
I can't tell

53
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,720
which road First Young Lady Ling took.

54
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,699
Follow the bamboo forest.

55
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,480

I have so much I wish to say to you.

81
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,320
And I have many things to tell you.

82
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:18,479
I was a hostage in Shuhuang.

83
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:20,120
You know it.

84
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,778
I couldn't leave Shuhuang

85
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:22,959
and return to Yue.

86
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,619
So I helped them in secret
by being their bargaining chip.

87
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,719
That's how I managed to return.

88
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,880
But Yu Zheng never expected that

89
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,599
I'd turn back on my word

90
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:32,320
once I returned to the capital.

91
00:05:32,859 --> 00:05:34,200
So you knew for a long time

92
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,360
that they were responsible

93
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,079
for the Yuyao Pass incident.

94
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,440
I only learned about it after.

95
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,120
I was only a boy then.

96
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:45,699
Many things were kept from me.

97
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,959
Little Highness, give the order now.

98
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,440
They're refugees.

99
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,658
If you don't do something,

100
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:52,719
they will freeze or starve to death.

101
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,719
Open the gates!

102
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,760
After Father died,

103
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,479
I became pawn for Shuhuang.

104
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:03,240
I laid low,

105
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,880
waiting for the chance to strike back.

106
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,399
Then why did you lie to me and say

107
00:06:09,299 --> 00:06:12,519
that you were responsible
for the Yuyao Pass breach?

108
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,159
I didn't want you to be implicated
in this mess again.

109
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:16,159
Plus...

110
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,279
Plus,

111
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,079
if not for me,

112
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,320
you would've been able
to live a carefree life.

113
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,920
Chuxia...

114
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,120
As it is,

115
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,479
I reckon there are still remnants
of Shuhuang in the capital.

116
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:36,839
How else would they know

117
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,639
about my and Father's plan so well?

118
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,360
Let's go back to the capital

119
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,639
and speak with Ziyan.

120
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:44,800
It's time to put a stop
to this matter once and for all.

121
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:47,079
Chuxia.

122
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,880
How come you're back so soon?

123
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,000
Mr. Baili.

124
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,120
Did you two reconcile?

125
00:06:56,339 --> 00:06:58,479
It's a long story, Yue.

126
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,240
We've finally figured out the ins and outs
of the Yuyao Pass incident.

127
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,159
We'll go and explain everything
to the Crown Prince tomorrow,

128
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:06,159
and exterminate
all remnants of Shuhuang.

129
00:07:13,739 --> 00:07:15,279
I knew you'd come back.

130
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:18,399
I will support you
no matter what you wish to do.

131
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,920
Your Highness, they are still alive.

132
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,880
Looks like I'll have to get rid of you.

133
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:47,599
Your Royal Highnesses.

134
00:07:49,299 --> 00:07:50,819
We have the result of the investigation

135
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,039
on the Yuyao Pass incident.

136
00:07:52,299 --> 00:07:53,218
It was caused

137
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:54,800
by Preceptor Yu colluding with Shuhuang.

138
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,800
I've written down the details
in the report.

139
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,800
After you're crowned as emperor,

140
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,279
I hope you'll grant restitution
to Chuxia's grandfather and family

141
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,399
and clear the name of a loyal minister.

142
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:05,639
Let the world know what really happened.

143
00:08:05,739 --> 00:08:06,560
In addition,

144
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,839
there remains remnants of Shuhuang
within the city.

145
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,360
I ask that Your Royal Highness send men

146
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,279
to help us get rid of them

147
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:14,760
and ensure Yue's stability.

148
00:08:16,219 --> 00:08:18,418
They are the remnants. Arrest them.

149
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:20,719
I think you people
are the Shuhuang remnants.

150
00:08:20,859 --> 00:08:22,819
Guards, capture them.

151
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,738
No, you won't!

152
00:08:23,739 --> 00:08:24,880
We have to go.

153
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:27,240
Run, my lord! I'll block them.

154
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,680
After them!

155
00:08:34,459 --> 00:08:36,440
Once Ziyan ascends the throne,

156
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,019
you people will have nowhere to run.

157
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,860
(General's Residence)

158
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,560
We won't be able to return
to the General's Residence.

159
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:50,160
Liang Ziyan seemed odd today.

160
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,999
I think

161
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:53,959
Yu Luoluo has him under her control.

162
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,619
Shuhuang supposedly has
a type of hallucinogenic drug

163
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,280
that grants control over a person,

164
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,239
turning them into a puppet.

165
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,800
From how he was acting today,

166
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,400
that has to be it.

167
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,999
Maybe we got it all wrong.

168
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,200
Preceptor Yu was merely a cover.

169
00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:12,079
