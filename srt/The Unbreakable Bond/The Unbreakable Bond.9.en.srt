(Adapted from Xiao A'man's novel)

She is Wooed By Big Shots of the Capital.")

=Episode 9=

4
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,520
That wretch, how dare she run away?

5
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,200
Madam, My Lord.

6
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,739
Have you found Ling Chuxia?

7
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,879
First Young Lady beat the drum
to address a grievance.

8
00:00:55,939 --> 00:00:58,959
She accused Second Young Lady
of murdering Young Master!

9
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,539
Mother, I didn't do it!

10
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,600
Right now, the officers
from the Capital Office are here.

11
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,680
What?

12
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:12,840
My Lord.

13
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,240
Prefect, my daughter had caused a mess.

14
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,919
I assume she had caused trouble for you.

15
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:17,960
Not at all.

16
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,539
I'll treat all those

17
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,179
who beat the drum impartially.

18
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,200
I'll definitely get to
the bottom of this.

19
00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:26,400
My Lord.

20
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,040
Since the person involved in the case
has arrived,

21
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,519
Prefect, we should begin the trial.

22
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,200
My Lord, please.

23
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:40,120
Who's Ling Qiuqing?

24
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,960
My Lord, I'm Ling Qiuqing.

25
00:01:45,779 --> 00:01:49,639
Ling Chuxia accused you of poisoning
and murdering Ling Dongyang, your brother.

26
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:50,899
Is that true?

27
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,138
My Lord, I didn't do so.

28
00:01:52,139 --> 00:01:53,880
Ling Chuxia maligned me.

29
00:02:05,419 --> 00:02:06,279
My Lord.

30
00:02:06,779 --> 00:02:09,880
Ling Qiuqing poisoned this snack.

31
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,880
(That was the snack Dongyang ate.)

32
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:13,519
(How did she find it?)

33
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,538
I didn't!

34
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:15,959
Ling Chuxia, you're spouting nonsense!

35
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,498
Did you use Lord Ming
to deliver this snack

36
00:02:22,499 --> 00:02:24,119
to my Summer Wind Hall?

37
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:32,160
Even if you're not talking now,
I'm sure someone saw it.

38
00:02:32,339 --> 00:02:33,859
I only put some
purging croton in the snack.

39
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,079
I never poisoned the snack.

40
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:39,359
So, you aren't the one

41
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,098
who poisoned him?

42
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:42,218
Of course not.

43
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:43,019
But Ling Dongyang died

44
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,899
after taking the snack.

45
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,959
Ling Chuxia!

46
00:02:46,339 --> 00:02:47,280
No.

47
00:02:47,619 --> 00:02:49,679
Sister, I was wrong!

48
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,538
But I didn't kill Dongyang!

49
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:52,959
It wasn't me!

50
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,098
That means

51
00:02:57,099 --> 00:02:58,538
the culprit is someone else.

52
00:02:58,539 --> 00:03:00,679
That's right.
The culprit is someone else.

53
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,639
Who is it, then?

54
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,239
I don't know.

55
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,320
Ling Chuxia.

56
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,399
You accused Ling Qiuqing
of murdering her brother.

57
00:03:13,779 --> 00:03:15,299
Now, you're saying
that she's not the culprit.

58
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,679
How can I conclude the trial?

59
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:19,639
My Lord.

60
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,440
I know that Ling Dongyang will
definitely take Yuanbao, his servant,

61
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,959
with him whenever he goes out.

62
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:27,519
I'm sure Yuanbao

63
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:29,079
knew what happened yesterday.

64
00:03:29,779 --> 00:03:31,399
Are you saying

65
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,560
that his servant knows
who the culprit is?

66
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,880
That's right.

67
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:36,679
All right.

68
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,880
Bring the servant here.

69
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,000
Yesterday,

70
00:03:42,779 --> 00:03:44,919
Yuanbao went missing

71
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,399
right after my brother's passing.

72
00:03:48,779 --> 00:03:49,880
What a coincidence.

73
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,880
When I was taking a walk this morning,

74
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,040
I captured a sneaky thief.

75
00:03:56,059 --> 00:03:57,480
I think that thief was Yuanbao.

76
00:03:57,819 --> 00:03:58,560
Come!

77
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,058
My Lord!

78
00:04:05,059 --> 00:04:06,799
My Lord, please save me!

79
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,160
Speak!

80
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,139
Who murdered Dongyang?

81
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,480
I dare not speak the truth!

82
00:04:13,779 --> 00:04:14,839
My Lord, please spare me!

83
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,519
Fengqiu House did
deliver the snack to us that day.

84
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:20,139
Young Master took a piece.

85
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,079
If so, why did you go missing

86
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:23,579
after Ling Dongyang's passing?

87
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,719
It was Nanny Gan!

88
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:26,579
The maidservant, Tao, said

89
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,479
Nanny Gan once took the snack.

90
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:34,560
That's right. It was me.

91
00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:38,200
I poisoned the snack without permission

92
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,760
in order to murder First Young Lady.

93
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:45,839
Without permission?

94
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,899
First Young Lady,
you have no respect for your elders

95
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,440
and are very arrogant.

96
00:04:51,179 --> 00:04:54,039
I just want to vent Madam's frustrations
on her behalf.

97
00:04:55,099 --> 00:04:57,959
I didn't expect it
to kill Young Master instead.

98
00:04:58,179 --> 00:04:58,959
You!

99
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,399
I deserve to die.

100
00:05:00,859 --> 00:05:02,200
I've committed a heinous mistake!

101
00:05:12,299 --> 00:05:14,440
She took her own life
by taking a poison pill.

102
00:05:16,739 --> 00:05:19,120
(The corpse cicada and
the Supreme Poison,)

103
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:20,639
(both of them are related to Nanny Gan.)

104
00:05:21,219 --> 00:05:23,320
(If so,
you're surely related to the case.)

105
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:34,159
Lord Ming,

106
00:05:34,299 --> 00:05:37,738
Miss Chuxia cleared her suspicion
at the Capital Office.

107
00:05:37,739 --> 00:05:40,320
She has returned to
the Prime Minister's Residence.

108
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,839
Leave!

109
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,240
Yunniang.

110
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,719
You're also one of
His Lordship's children.

111
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,719
How could they treat you like this?

112
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:52,639
He never took me as his own daughter

113
00:05:52,859 --> 00:05:55,079
ever since Mother's passing.

114
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:56,760
Chuxia.

115
00:05:59,179 --> 00:06:00,200
Yue?

116
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,560
I'm here to take you home.

117
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,800
Could it be that I was mistaken?

118
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,320
There's nothing special
about this painting.

119
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:15,959
The clues must be hidden elsewhere.

120
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,920
My Lord, please don't be impatient.

121
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,680
I shall study it together with you.

122
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,800
You can't even stand reading
the Three Character Classic.

123
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,218
You should check if Ling Chuxia

124
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,619
has arrived at the General's Residence.

125
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,800
I shall study it myself.

126
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:31,298
Since you told me to leak the news
to them,

127
00:06:31,299 --> 00:06:32,819
I assume Mr. Baili

128
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,760
has picked Miss Chuxia up by now.

129
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,680
I hope that she can

130
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,560
stay at the General's Residence
peacefully for a few days.

131
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,159
My Lord, I'm sorry.

132
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,599
Wait.

133
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,079
There's a hidden painting
under the surface.

134
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:53,360
I see.

135
00:06:54,739 --> 00:06:55,560
Lie Feng,

136
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,240
seems like I have to pay

137
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:00,519
the General's Residence a visit.

138
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:05,360
(Now that I've returned
to the General's Residence again,)

139
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:08,399
(everything has changed.)

140
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:14,800
Chuxia.

141
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,719
Did you sleep well last night?

142
00:07:17,859 --> 00:07:19,039
I did.

143
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,379
Young Master, Young Lady,

144
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,218
you guys can go ahead.

145
00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:22,519
I have to brew Young Master's medicine.

146
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,360
I appeared out of the blue last night.

147
00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:26,959
Were you frightened?

148
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,680
Yue, I just didn't expect you to appear.

149
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:36,279
Did you think I'd forgotten about you?

150
00:07:36,859 --> 00:07:38,218
Actually, I've read all of your letters

151
00:07:38,219 --> 00:07:39,719
for the past decade.

152
00:07:42,179 --> 00:07:43,719
But you didn't write back to me.

153
00:07:43,859 --> 00:07:46,000
You sent your men to check on
our residence several times.

154
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,240
I knew that too.

155
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:51,320
But you sent them all away.

156
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,120
That's why I know

157
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,399
that you hate me.

158
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,360
Yue,

159
00:08:00,219 --> 00:08:02,440
after the incident back then,

160
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:05,760
the General's Residence
was raided and punished.

161
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:08,399
No matter how insensible I am,

162
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,599
I understand the reason
behind your actions.

163
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:13,680
Why would I hate you for it?

164
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,479
Chuxia, it must've been tough
on you all these years.

165
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,639
From now on, this will be your home.

166
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:24,479
You won't get bullied again.

167
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:27,639
Yue,

168
00:08:29,299 --> 00:08:30,560
so, your leg injury

169
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,040
hasn't recovered
even after all these years.

170
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,119
Give me your hand.

171
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,999
There are blood clots,
and your patella is shattered.

172
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:50,400

such serious injuries?
