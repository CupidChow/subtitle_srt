00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,000
=Episode 12=

4
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:00,200
Yue.

5
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:02,319
Is it very painful?

6
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:03,800
It's fine.

7
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:06,519
I can continue.

8
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,680
Young Master's legs

9
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,480
has been keeping him up at night.

10
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:10,719
The pain is unbearable.

11
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:14,840
Yue.

12
00:01:16,779 --> 00:01:17,960
Is this

13
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:22,279
how it's been for you
the past ten years?

14
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:25,200
I'm used to it.

15
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,040
Yue.

16
00:01:39,339 --> 00:01:41,240
This is only our first
acupuncture session.

17
00:01:42,339 --> 00:01:43,240
Rest assured.

18
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,840
I will make you better,
slowly but surely.

19
00:01:51,499 --> 00:01:53,919
(At first, I thought treating
Yue's legs)

20
00:01:54,419 --> 00:01:56,240
(meant I could live the life I want.)

21
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,459
(Now, the most important thing)

22
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,799
(is to find out what really happened
at Yuyao Pass.)

23
00:02:03,139 --> 00:02:04,760
(Should I tell Yue)

24
00:02:04,779 --> 00:02:07,480
(that the Yuyao Pass incident
had been manipulated.)

25
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,919
(Forget it.)

26
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,679
(Yue is hindered by his legs.)

27
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:12,320
(I'll leave that conversation
to after he's healed.)

28
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,058
Miss Chuxia, Young Master asked me
to invite you to the main parlor.

29
00:02:17,059 --> 00:02:18,519
Lord Ming is here.

30
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,720
There's no rush.

31
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,000
Let Lord Ming wait.

32
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,799
We will go in a bit.

33
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:28,399
I'd like to see

34
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:30,320
what Lord Ming

35
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,480
has up his sleeve this time.

36
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,560
Chuxia.

37
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:37,919
Chuxia, you're finally here.

38
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:39,880
I thought you didn't want to see me.

39
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,378
May I know why Your Highness

40
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:44,658
came to my cousin's mansion

41
00:02:44,659 --> 00:02:45,839
so early in the morning?

42
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:49,040
The reason I came

43
00:02:49,619 --> 00:02:51,440
is to ask for your hand
in marriage once more.

44
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,399
Previously, it was due misunderstandings
on my part.

45
00:02:53,499 --> 00:02:55,119
This time, with Yue as witness,

46
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,280
I'd like to retie
the red string with you.

47
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:03,560
I've left
the Prime Minister's Residence.

48
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:05,519
My cousin Yue
is my closest relative now.

49
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,440
Do you agree to it, Yue?

50
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,320
Yue.

51
00:03:09,779 --> 00:03:11,880
It is not in my position
to decide for Chuxia.

52
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:13,600
Regarding her marriage,

53
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,320
it's best for Chuxia to decide herself.

54
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:21,899
Since Yue respects my own opinion,

55
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,079
then I shall decide myself.

56
00:03:25,779 --> 00:03:28,200
You should leave, Your Highness.

57
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:31,320
I will never agree
to the marriage proposal.

58
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:32,338
Ling Chuxia,

59
00:03:32,339 --> 00:03:33,739
are you chasing me out?

60
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,320
I purposely came today
bringing betrothal gifts.

61
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,079
Did you forget who I am?

62
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,280
I am the emperor's only son.

63
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:44,480
I condescended to come
to the mansion of criminal.

64
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,399
Is this how you're treating me?

65
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:49,639
Is Your Highness using your status

66
00:03:49,779 --> 00:03:51,839
to force me into saying yes
to the marriage?

67
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:55,480
I'm asking you to think carefully.

68
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,399
There's no need to think.

69
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:03,480
Chuxia,

70
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,679
I'll answer him for you.

71
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:09,000
I was wondering

72
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,658
why the usually quiet
General's Residence

73
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:12,239
was so rowdy this early in the day.

74
00:04:12,779 --> 00:04:14,200
Turns out Ziyan is here.

75
00:04:14,619 --> 00:04:16,880
How come you entered
from the back courtyard?

76
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,079
Are you living
at the General's Residence?

77
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,200
I've also proposed to Chuxia.

78
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,599
And she has already agreed.

79
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,360
Previously, due to you two's engagement,

80
00:04:27,859 --> 00:04:28,939
I had kept quiet

81
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,639
about my feelings for Chuxia.

82
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:33,279
Now that the engagement
had been called off,

83
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,719
it meant I could propose to Chuxia.

84
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:38,738
You two...

85
00:04:38,739 --> 00:04:40,200
The wedding has been decided.

86
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,320
The only thing now is to pick
an auspicious date

87
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,120
to marry my Chuxia.

88
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,839
Don't try to bluff me.

89
00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:51,959
You don't believe me?

90
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,120
Liefeng, bring the letter
of appointment.

91
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:56,959
Let Lord Ming take a look.

92
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,800
Impossible!

93
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,159
I will never give up!

94
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,538
Stop gawking and go!

95
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:13,399
Yes, Your Highness.

96
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:24,639
Yue.

97
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,680
I planned this with Lord Ling
ahead of time.

98
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:31,240
I needed his help to stop Lord Ming
from pestering me.

99
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,839
I could tell.

100
00:05:34,859 --> 00:05:37,320
Thank you, Your Highness,
for helping Chuxia.

101
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,920
You really prepared everything.

102
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:40,920
I'm tired from
this early morning ruckus.

103
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,279
De, help me back to my room.

104
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,680
Lord Ling always answers to requests,

105
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:50,479
fulfilling one's trust.

106
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,279
How was it?

107
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:56,360
Are you happy
with my performance this time?

108
00:05:58,299 --> 00:06:00,719
I didn't know you had such good

109
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,120
acting skills.

110
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:05,360
Who said I was acting?

111
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,360
I meant it.

112
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:17,080
Remember to shake
the jade bell next time.

113
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,719
Maybe I'd be able to turn up sooner
to help you out.

114
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:36,880
Miss.

115
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,719
(Lantern Festival, lantern parade)

116
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,399
(First prize, Blazing Kirin)

117
00:06:51,299 --> 00:06:52,778
What are you so happy about, miss?

118
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,680
There's a way to cure Yue's condition.

119
00:06:55,739 --> 00:06:57,000
Tonight is the Lantern Festival.

120
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:58,840
I'm going to take part
in the lantern riddles contest

121
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,680
and find a way to win the Blazing Kirin.

122
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,159
Yunniang,

123
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,899
take this prescription I wrote

124
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,418
to Baicao Apothecary out of town.

125
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:06,858
Grab the rest of the required herbs.

126
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:07,639
Got it.

127
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,178
Leave it to me

128
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,459
to get what you need.

129
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,959
Tonight, you'll surely
win the first prize.

130
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:13,880
Go on, then.

131
00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:32,000
Where are you off to?

132
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:33,000
Mother.

133
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:35,178
It's the Lantern Festival tonight.

134
00:07:35,179 --> 00:07:37,079
I heard Lord Ming will be going, too.

135
00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:39,000
Your little brother just passed away

136
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,619
and you're thinking about men?

137
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,680
I didn't kill Ling Dongyang.

138
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,399
I'm going no matter what!

139
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:50,800
I will marry Lord Ming
and become the Crown Princess.

140
00:07:50,859 --> 00:07:52,658
I'm going to be the future empress!

141
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:54,139
I will beat Ling Chuxia

142
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,560
and stand above everyone else!

143
00:07:57,219 --> 00:07:57,959
