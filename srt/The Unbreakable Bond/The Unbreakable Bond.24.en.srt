00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,440
=The Unbreakable Bond=
(Adapted from Xiao A'man's novel)

2
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,020
("After the Ugly Concubine Divorced,
She is Wooed By Big Shots of the Capital.")

3
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,100
=Episode 24=

4
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,999
Hand over the elixir quietly.

5
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,419
Then you can face the music

6
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,920
alongside Liang Junye
at the Heavenly Prison.

7
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,279
Why go through the trouble?

8
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:53,559
You could've just captured me.

9
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,219
Why bother putting on this show?

10
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,600
It's a matter
of catching you red-handed.

11
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,279
Surely you understand, Miss Chuxia.

12
00:00:58,299 --> 00:00:59,879
You failed to grasp how evil people are.

13
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,639
So I'll show you what it's all about.

14
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:03,599
That's if you're capable of doing so.

15
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:05,559
- Quick!
- Go!

16
00:01:06,219 --> 00:01:07,999
She's cornered. No need to chase.

17
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:09,279
Go back and wait for further orders.

18
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,880
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

19
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,680
Chuxia is always a step ahead.

20
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,999
She came up with a great feint.

21
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:54,999
Yue.

22
00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:57,719
Jiang Li and I will sneak into
the palace to look for evidence.

23
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,120
Preceptor Yu will surely
send his men after me.

24
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,159
This means his mansion is less secure.

25
00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:03,858
Your leg is good now.

26
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:05,240
But no one knows about it.

27
00:02:05,499 --> 00:02:07,418
I'll have to ask you

28
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:09,259
to look for evidence
in Preceptor Yu's mansion.

29
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,000
Rest assured. I will get it done.

30
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,440
Things are going as planned.

31
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,560
Ling Chuxia infiltrated the palace.

32
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:20,799
She is a wanted criminal.

33
00:02:22,779 --> 00:02:25,119
The Crown Prince
will be made emperor soon.

34
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,720
Then Liang Junye
will be sentenced to death.

35
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:31,338
Naturally, Ling Chuxia won't get away.

36
00:02:31,339 --> 00:02:33,959
What should we do about her now?

37
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,399
She was caught red-handed.

38
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,320
I doubt she can cause anymore trouble.

39
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,720
For now, let her be for a few days.

40
00:02:43,059 --> 00:02:44,720
Yes, understood.

41
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,519
We can be certain

42
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:48,959
that His Majesty
had been chronically poisoned.

43
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,720
Preceptor Yu set Liang Junye up

44
00:02:51,779 --> 00:02:53,560
at the emperor's birthday banquet.

45
00:02:53,779 --> 00:02:55,679
How can we expose his schemes?

46
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,200
Preceptor Yu is cunning.

47
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,079
Without concrete evidence,

48
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,000
we won't be able to topple him.

49
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:05,600
Junye

50
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,440
will have to suffer
a bit longer in prison.

51
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,040
Right.

52
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,679
You found the Baili jade hairpin
in the palace.

53
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,839
It could be the key
to open the secret chamber.

54
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,760
Perhaps it contains proof
to indict Preceptor Yu.

55
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:21,160
Yue.

56
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,119
Let's go and check it out.

57
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,480
This is...

58
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,839
Yue.

59
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:01,119
Hold this for me.

60
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,620
(To Preceptor Yu)

61
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,880
That weasel, Preceptor Yu.

62
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:16,579
Back then, he coveted the jade mine
treasures of Shuhuang

63
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,560
for his own selfish desires

64
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:20,200
and colluded with the people of Shuhuang

65
00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:22,680
even at the cost of ceding Yuyao Pass.

66
00:04:23,299 --> 00:04:25,079
We have the proof we need.

67
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:26,240
Yue,

68
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,338
it's time to act.

69
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:30,680
What is your plan?

70
00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:32,479
Liefeng.

71
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,920
Go and find someone for me.

72
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,619
Open the door.

73
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,360
Yes, my lord.

74
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,079
Uncle,

75
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,440
I came to ask you one last time

76
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,000
before you're put to death.

77
00:05:00,299 --> 00:05:02,440
Why did you kill Father?

78
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:05,538
I suppose I now have to address you

79
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:07,039
as Your Royal Highness, right?

80
00:05:10,739 --> 00:05:12,440
Don't call me "uncle" anymore.

81
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,639
Your servant is humbled.

82
00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:19,399
Even in the face of death,

83
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:21,440
you're giving us the roundabout.

84
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,760
Your Royal Highness.

85
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,200
Your coronation is happening soon.

86
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:30,920
To reassure the ministers,

87
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:32,760
you need to wrap this up properly.

88
00:05:33,219 --> 00:05:34,418
Enough talking.

89
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:35,599
Just settle the matter.

90
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,680
This concerns the royal reputation.

91
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,880
Since you refuse to explain,

92
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,800
then don't blame me
for what I'm about to do.

93
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,279
Killing my father

94
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:50,839
is absolutely irreconcilable.

95
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:52,200
Guards,

96
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,880
put Lord Ling to death immediately.

97
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,039
White silk or poisoned wine.

98
00:05:58,179 --> 00:06:00,680
I'll leave it to you to choose, Uncle.

99
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,000
I'll take the wine, then.

100
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,440
Getting drunk
is a rare occurrence for me.

101
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:11,920
But I never thought

102
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,259
that my last drink

103
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,079
would be in a place like this.

104
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,120
Wait!

105
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,160
Princess Ziyuan. Are you attempting
to break him out of the Heavenly Prison?

106
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:32,479
Did you forget how your father died?

107
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,178
Lord Preceptor, you seem
overly eager to kill him.

108
00:06:35,179 --> 00:06:36,738
Is it to shut him up for good?

109
00:06:36,739 --> 00:06:38,639
You're accusing me
without any basis, Princess.

110
00:06:38,859 --> 00:06:39,839
Lord Preceptor.

111
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,440
Since everyone is present,

112
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:46,959
we will reveal the truth.

113
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:53,240
Do you know this elixir?

114
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,639
It was found in your mansion.

115
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,560
It contains the Supreme Poison.

116
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,699
The elixir the emperor
had been taking

117
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,959
also contained the poison.

118
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:05,519
What do you have to say
about that, Lord Preceptor?

119
00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:08,440
That's merely your one-sided statement.

120
00:07:09,739 --> 00:07:11,059
Why should anyone believe

121
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,259
that you found the elixir
in my mansion?

122
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,399
I knew you would deny it.

123
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,719
So let's hear from the witness.

124
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,680
You!

125
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:24,760
Your Royal Highness, I am Jiang Li.

126
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:26,120
I'm Preceptor Yu's godson,

127
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,680
and also his disposable assassin.

128
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,218
I received the order
to capture First Young Lady Ling

129
00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:32,120
for finding the elixir in the palace.

130
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:34,120
I present the elixir to you now.

131
00:07:34,179 --> 00:07:35,360
Jiang Li?

132
00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:38,320
I saw you previously
at the General's Residence.

133
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,920
I see.

134
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:44,079
You guys have long suspected
Preceptor Yu.

135
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:45,920
Only I know the truth.

136
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,240
Preceptor Yu.

137
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:50,519
How will you explain this?

138
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,959
Father died from this poison.

139
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,338
And the elixir found at your mansion

140
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:56,599
is the same kind that my father
took in private.

141
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,440
So the one who killed my father is you.

142
00:08:01,739 --> 00:08:03,120
There is no direct evidence.

143
00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:06,159
Ling Chuxia and Jiang Li
are in this together.

144
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,560
God forbids, I've been framed!

145
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,639
If Jiang Li and I hadn't played along

146
00:08:12,179 --> 00:08:14,000
and devised this counter attack,

147
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:15,298
it would've been much harder

148
00:08:15,299 --> 00:08:16,800
to find leverage on you, Lord Preceptor.

149
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,519
But that's okay.

150
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,240
I have other proof.

151
00:08:31,739 --> 00:08:32,800
Lord Preceptor.

152
00:08:33,699 --> 00:08:35,920
So you not only poisoned Father,

153
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
you also colluded with the enemy, betrayed
the country, and abused power for personal gain.

154
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,400
Look at all the things you've done!

155
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,999
We lost hundreds of soldiers

156
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:46,200
and countless commoners
at the Yuyao Pass incident.

157
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,119
All for the sake of your self interest.

158
00:08:50,659 --> 00:08:51,800
Lord Preceptor,

159
00:08:52,819 --> 00:08:54,719
have you no shame?

160
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,400
Guards,

161
00:08:57,699 --> 00:08:59,680
throw this traitor in Earthly Prison!

162
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,778
I will mete out punishment
once I ascend the throne.

163
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:03,739
I'm innocent!

164
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,418
Your Royal Highness!

165
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,119
Get going.
