=The Unbreakable Bond=
(Adapted from Xiao A'man's novel)

00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,960
("After the Ugly Concubine Divorced,
She is Wooed By Big Shots of the Capital.")

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,000
=Episode 7=

4
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:52,840
Today is that day of the month, right?

5
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:54,658
Go and get that thing for me.

6
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:55,520
Yes, Madam.

7
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:02,539
This is strange. Why is it gone?

8
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,559
I put it here.

9
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:06,858
Every month,
she'll use the juice on her face.

10
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:08,519
Why haven't you brought it here?

11
00:01:09,419 --> 00:01:11,359
So, it's here.

12
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:13,418
I'm coming.

13
00:01:13,419 --> 00:01:14,880
It's still juicy.

14
00:01:20,779 --> 00:01:22,639
When I wake up tomorrow,

15
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,338
I'll look even more beautiful.

16
00:01:25,339 --> 00:01:27,019
His Lordship
has been busy with work lately.

17
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,120
He needs to take a good rest.

18
00:01:29,699 --> 00:01:31,459
You are a natural beauty.

19
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,120
I'm sure His Lordship dotes on you.

20
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,999
I never thought that Madam Qu

21
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,240
would have a golden cicada.

22
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,240
(I swapped the two cicadas.)

23
00:01:45,419 --> 00:01:46,939
(Madam Qu wouldn't have realized)

24
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,799
(that she was using
the corpse cicada on her face.)

25
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,840
Since she cares so much about her looks,

26
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:58,240
I'll teach her a lesson this time.

27
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,200
Are you sure you don't want
to go and take a look?

28
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:05,480
With how I am right now,

29
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,960
I'll just be a burden to her.

30
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:09,679
So many years have passed.

31
00:02:09,779 --> 00:02:11,679
As long as Chuxia is happy,

32
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:13,919
I can rest assured.

33
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:17,480
De.

34
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,440
Open the window.

35
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,720
If Chuxia needs me,

36
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:30,799
I'll show up right away.

37
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:33,639
I hear that Madam Qu has fallen ill.

38
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,079
It's my fault for being
too busy with work lately

39
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,040
until I've neglected her.

40
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,338
Don't listen to the gossips
from the servants, My Lord.

41
00:02:40,339 --> 00:02:42,519
She was doing fine last night.

42
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:45,139
She just lost a bit of weight because

43
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,600
she missed you too much.

44
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,218
She also said

45
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:49,778
that she was going to visit you today.

46
00:02:49,779 --> 00:02:50,600
Good.

47
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,519
My Lord, why are you here
so early in the morning?

48
00:02:54,059 --> 00:02:55,839
I haven't washed up yet.

49
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:57,419
I hope I didn't scare you.

50
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,399
You...

51
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,579
What happened to your face?

52
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,778
My face? What's wrong with my face?

53
00:03:02,779 --> 00:03:04,739
I don't want to see you
at all right now.

54
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,019
You look disgusting.

55
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,280
What's wrong with my face?

56
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:09,480
Madam Qu.

57
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,419
It was supposed to be a golden cicada.

58
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,200
When did it turn into a corpse cicada?

59
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,880
It must be her.

60
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,280
It must be her.

61
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,280
Ling Chuxia, I won't forgive you!

62
00:03:30,499 --> 00:03:31,919
The prescription is fake.

63
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,440
Ling Chuxia must have
tricked me on purpose.

64
00:03:36,059 --> 00:03:37,679
Madam Qu, drink this.

65
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:39,299
After taking this Five-Poison Antidote,

66
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,679
your face will recover by evening.

67
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:44,498
Get me a salted plum.

68
00:03:44,499 --> 00:03:45,239
Yes, Madam Qu.

69
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:49,139
Mother.

70
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,440
What is that terrible smell?

71
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:52,899
Mother,

72
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,079
that ugly duckling, Ling Chuxia,
gave me a fake prescription

73
00:03:56,499 --> 00:03:57,839
and ruined my face.

74
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,419
Mother, you have to help me.

75
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,259
Enough.

76
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,459
If you didn't ask me to help you

77
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,658
fight against that ugly duckling,

78
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,519
I wouldn't be like this now.

79
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:06,098
Don't panic, Miss Qing.

80
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:07,259
The marks on your face

81
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,658
are caused by balsam juice.

82
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:11,440
They will be gone in a few days.

83
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,859
Mother, I don't care.

84
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,399
I'll teach her a lesson myself.

85
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,800
That useless daughter of mine.

86
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,738
Nanny Gan, keep an eye on her.

87
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:21,259
Yes, Madam Qu.

88
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,820
(Prime Minister's Residence)

89
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:27,738
Miss Qing.

90
00:04:27,739 --> 00:04:28,499
Go.

91
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,519
Send these to the Summer Wind Hall.

92
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,479
Yes, Miss Qing.

93
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,639
Wait.

94
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:41,399
Tell her that these are from Lord Ming.

95
00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:42,519
Yes, Miss Qing.

96
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,599
(That's a very strong drug.)

97
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,039
Ling Chuxia.

98
00:04:49,299 --> 00:04:51,259
It's time for you to suffer.

99
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,039
Stop right there.

100
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,320
Nanny Gan.

101
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,059
Did you send some gifts

102
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,098
that a lady will like

103
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:01,240
to Miss Ling based on my advice?

104
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:04,159
I've sent her some delicious desserts

105
00:05:04,219 --> 00:05:06,729
that are nice and cooling
for the hot weather.

106
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:08,320
I've also given her
some gold and silver hairpins.

107
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:10,639
I think by doing so,

108
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:12,719
Chuxia will return to me.

109
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,880
How do you know that?

110
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:18,039
Although I'm not in the residence,

111
00:05:18,739 --> 00:05:20,000
I can feel

112
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:21,839
that Chuxia

113
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,719
is just playing hard to get.

114
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,320
A purging croton

115
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:29,360
is not enough to dissipate
my hatred for her.

116
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,218
Back then, I didn't kill her

117
00:05:32,219 --> 00:05:35,039
because His Majesty arranged a marriage

118
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:37,440
between her and Lord Ming.

119
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,880
But she

120
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,519
broke off her engagement with Lord Ming.

121
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,200
Without the engagement,

122
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:45,079
we don't have to hold back anymore.

123
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,379
Do we have any Supreme Poison left?

124
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,120
Yes.

125
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,360
Get rid of her in secret.
Don't leave any traces behind.

126
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:58,479
Stop right there.

127
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,200
Where are you going?

128
00:06:05,219 --> 00:06:07,159
I'm here to serve
Miss Ling some desserts.

129
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,240
No.

130
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,000
You serve under Qiuqing.

131
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,599
You must be mistaken.

132
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,920
I know every woman

133
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,599
in this residence.

134
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:23,000
What is it?

135
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,639
Has Lord Ming taken a fancy
to Ling Chuxia?

136
00:06:31,299 --> 00:06:33,599
Is that why this useless Ling Qiuqing

137
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:35,178
wants to butter her up

138
00:06:35,179 --> 00:06:37,120
so that she can be a concubine
at Lord Ming's Residence?

139
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:49,000
Ling Chuxia doesn't deserve

140
00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:52,800
such delicious desserts.

141
00:06:57,779 --> 00:06:58,880
Miss Ling.

142
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:01,819
Lord Ming sent us so many gifts.

143
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,098
Won't it be improper for us
to accept them?

144
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:05,619
Why shouldn't we accept them

145
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,399
if he wants to give them to us?

146
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:12,079
I still have an unsettled business.

147
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,479
We'll leave when I'm done.

148
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,159
Help!

149
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,360
Mr. Dongyang.

150
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:36,800
(It's the Supreme Poison again.)

151
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:38,920
(It's the same culprit.)

152
00:07:40,299 --> 00:07:41,680
(But why did that person)

153
00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:43,639
(murder Ling Dongyang without a reason?)

154
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:45,959
Dongyang.

155
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:47,920
Ling Chuxia.

156
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:50,279
How could you kill Dongyang?

157
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:51,360
What is it?

158
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,680
Did you see me kill him?

159
00:07:55,539 --> 00:07:57,499
There are only two of you here.

160
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,599
Other than you,
who else could have killed him?

161
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,479
Why are you so sure I killed him?

162
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:07,279
Do you know something?

163
00:08:07,299 --> 00:08:08,560
What are you trying to do?

164
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:11,560
Are you going to kill me too?

165
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:13,639
Father, Mother.

166
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,039
Ling Chuxia killed Dongyang.

167
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:19,079
Miss Ling, what should we do now?

168
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,880
Since we are being framed for murder,

169
00:08:24,859 --> 00:08:28,039
it won't be so easy to clear our name.

170
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:36,759
Dongyang.

171
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,079
Dongyang.

172
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,719
Father.

173
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,680
Guards.

174
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:48,520
Take this evil lady
who killed her own brother away

175
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,040
