00:00:36,984 --> 00:00:38,780
=The Unbreakable Bond=
(Adapted from Xiao A'man's novel)

2
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,960
("After the Ugly Concubine Divorced,
She is Wooed By Big Shots of the Capital.")

3
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,100
=Episode 2=

4
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,940
The spy has sent news,

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,419
saying that Miss Chuxia has returned
to the Prime Minister's Residence.

6
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:52,220
Your Highness,
why don't you help Miss Chuxia

7
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:53,739
get rid of the imbecile?

8
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,320
She has been quietly enduring
and biding her time.

9
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,379
From what I know about her,

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,739
she has no issue

11
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,118
handling it herself.

12
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:03,919
It seems like

13
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,438
the marriage between Miss Chuxia
and Lord Ming

14
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:06,580
has really come to an end.

15
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,659
Your Highness,

16
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,860
Don't you plan to reveal your identity
to Miss Chuxia?

17
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:13,980
Assassin?

18
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:19,099
I have divorced Liang Ziyan.

19
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:21,019
With my father's temper,

20
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,700
he will definitely be furious.

21
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,179
Who's there?

22
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,619
(It's Lord Ling, Liang Junye.)

23
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,420
(Judging from the commotion,)

24
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,780
(was there someone hot on his heels?)

25
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,619
He's been poisoned.

26
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,438
But

27
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,459
why did he fall from my roof?

28
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,099
(If Lord Ling passed away in my room,)

29
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:03,500
(I won't be able to leave
the Prime Minister's Residence safely.)

30
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,259
(I should help him now,)

31
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,099
(so he can return me a favor
in the future.)

32
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,959
(I've suppressed the toxin
with the help of acupuncture.)

33
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,140
(The rest is up to him.)

34
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,140
(If it goes well,)

35
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,499
(he'll be able to expel
the poisoned blood very soon.)

36
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,580
(I didn't expect him
to recover so quickly.)

37
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,339
(He has survived.)

38
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,380
(What is she doing here?)

39
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,459
(Did she remove the toxin from my body?)

40
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:42,860
Why did you untie my gown?

41
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,459
I should be the one questioning you.

42
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,580
Why did you fall from my roof?

43
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,300
Did you remove the toxin in my body?

44
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,980
If you're not happy with that,

45
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:00,860
I don't mind

46
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,380
poisoning you again.

47
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,980
I don't mean to offend you.

48
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,540
Thanks for saving me.

49
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,540
You're welcome.

50
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,700
You helped me when we were at
Lord Ming's Residence just now.

51
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,339
Let's call it even, then.

52
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,420
I'll get going.

53
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,179
Wait a minute.

54
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,260
You haven't answered my question.

55
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,219
Was someone trying

56
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:27,939
to assassinate you?

57
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:30,499
It has nothing to do with you.

58
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,219
If Your Highness doesn't wish
to reveal it,

59
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,019
I won't press on.

60
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,660
But I saved your life.

61
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,860
How could we get even so easily?

62
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,660
So what do you want?

63
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,499
If I need your help in the future,

64
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,939
you have to lend me a hand.

65
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,860
Now I know why you had the heart
to divorce your husband in public.

66
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,300
(Rumor has it that Lord Ling
is an arrogant man.)

67
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,300
(However, he acts very differently
every time we meet.)

68
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,340
Miss Ling,

69
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:30,679
does applying this every day

70
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,819
really remove the mark on your face?

71
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,980
I got the mark from poisoning.

72
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:38,579
The previous medication
has eliminated most of the toxicity.

73
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,980
I only have to apply this
for a few more days

74
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,860
and we'll see the results very soon.

75
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,420
Toxic?

76
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,739
I didn't tell you before

77
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,220
because I didn't want to alert anyone.

78
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,318
Ling Chuxia!

79
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:58,739
Show yourself now!

80
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,860
Mr. Ling...

81
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:11,139
Ling Dongyang, what do you want?

82
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,499
Ling Chuxia.

83
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,318
(Ling Dongyang, illegitimate son of the Prime Minister)
I loathe the sight of you.

84
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,919
You make me lose my appetite
for three good days.

85
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,479
Wench. You had the audacity to come home

86
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,958
and assault the men at home.

87
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,300
Today, I'll take revenge
on my sister's behalf!

88
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,679
My sister should be the one

89
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,059
to marry Lord Ming!

90
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,259
Really?

91
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,520
Anyway, I have already divorced
Liang Ziyan.

92
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,080
It's just trash
I have already disposed of.

93
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:38,999
You can take it if you want to.

94
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,900
You...

95
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,340
Miss Ling!

96
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,179
Mr. Ling...

97
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,119
(How did this hag get so good?)

98
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,900
Miss Ling hurt Mr. Dongyang!

99
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,838
Ling Chuxia, how dare you?

100
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:52,900
Really?

101
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,619
I can do even more.

102
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:01,660
Mr. Ling was hurt!

103
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,819
What?

104
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,300
How dare you hit me?

105
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,920
I'm your elder sister. Why not?

106
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,438
- I've put up with you long enough.
- Stop it!

107
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,420
- I...
- Stop it!

108
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:11,780
Sister!

109
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:16,340
Hurry up and help Mr. Ling up!

110
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,379
How shameless.

111
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,599
Hag.

112
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,460
You just got kicked out
of Lord Ming's Residence.

113
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,139
Shouldn't you be embarrassed?

114
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,619
How dare you still act so arrogantly?

115
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,780
What?

116
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:29,780
She was kicked out of the residence?

117
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,819
Ling Chuxia had an affair
with her servant on her wedding day.

118
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,499
How embarrassing.

119
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,860
I had an affair?

120
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,020
You know very well what happened.

121
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:43,900
(This wench used to listen
to everything I say.)

122
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:46,699
(Why did she become so assertive
after her wedding?)

123
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,660
That's why.

124
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:51,980
If you were the one who proposed the divorce,
where's your dowry?

125
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,078
Why didn't you get it back?

126
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,359
You are obviously lying.

127
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,758
I'll kill you today.

128
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,579
Mr. Ling!

129
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,379
Yunniang...

130
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,499
How dare you hurt my maid?

131
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,739
I think you need more beating.

132
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:12,579
Dongyang.

133
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,679
I don't understand

134
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,078
how the wench changed so much.

135
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:15,559
Mr. Ling.

136
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,300
We can't get anything
out of this right now.

137
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:18,679
Let's talk to our mother first.

138
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,900
Let's go.

139
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,398
Miss Ling.

140
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:28,198
You never fought them head-on.

141
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,739
What happened this time?

142
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:31,939
I told you

143
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,020
that it was my fault.

144
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,939
We won't have
to put up with their nonsense anymore.

145
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,638
Once we get out of here,

146
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,518
we'll be rid

147
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,059
of them both.

148
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,900
Miss Ling, your dowries...

149
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:52,780
Those dowries arrived

150
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,819
at Lord Ming's Residence yesterday
after the wedding the same time I did.

151
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,139
They are mine.

152
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:01,579
Of course, I'll keep them.

153
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:10,900
Please punish me, Your Highness.

154
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,699
I put Your Highness in danger yesterday.

155
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,900
Get up.

156
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,059
I'm fine.

157
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:18,780
So many years have passed,

158
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:21,139
but he still refused
to let Your Highness go.

159
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,179
Don't worry about it.

160
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,499
He pretends as if nothing happened,

161
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,638
so I will not expose him either.

162
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:27,420
Yes.

163
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:30,179
We'll have a lot of fun
in Lord Ming's Residence today.

164
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,739
The wedding isn't over yet.

165
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,500
Let's go.

166
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,699
We'll go and have a look.
