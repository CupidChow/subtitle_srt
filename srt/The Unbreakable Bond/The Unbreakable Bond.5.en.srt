00:00:36,984 --> 00:00:38,780
=The Unbreakable Bond=
(Adapted from Xiao A'man's novel)

2
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,960
("After the Ugly Concubine Divorced,
She is Wooed By Big Shots of the Capital.")

3
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,000
=Episode 5=

4
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:49,539
Miss Chuxia is dressed
in camouflage clothing

5
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,879
and headed towards the Royal Cemetery.

6
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,440
Not sure what she's up to.

7
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,200
The clues before also point
to the Royal Cemetery.

8
00:00:57,339 --> 00:00:58,520
I'll go and check it out, too.

9
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,120
Let's see what I'll find there.

10
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,520
I'll go with you

11
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,840
in case something happens.

12
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,200
No need. The Royal Cemetery
is full of danger.

13
00:01:07,339 --> 00:01:08,618
I'll go in on my own.

14
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:09,960
You'll stay watch outside.

15
00:01:10,699 --> 00:01:11,439
Got it.

16
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,359
(The Supreme Poison can only
be cured with Blue Grass.)

17
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:22,519
(And Blue Grass only grows
in the most favorable place.)

18
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:26,639
Who's there?

19
00:01:28,059 --> 00:01:29,539
You, come with me.

20
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,200
Yes, sir.

21
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,159
You again.

22
00:02:07,499 --> 00:02:09,338
Seems like we share quite the affinity.

23
00:02:09,339 --> 00:02:10,560
We're always bumping into each other.

24
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:12,639
What are you doing here?

25
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:16,560
For something specific.

26
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,560
Me, too.

27
00:02:18,499 --> 00:02:20,639
(Is he here to grab
the Blue Grass from me?)

28
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:27,440
(Why does she need the Blue Grass?)

29
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,320
This place is cold and scary.

30
00:02:29,339 --> 00:02:30,519
I have an idea.

31
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,639
Why don't we partner up?

32
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:33,839
Watch each other's back?

33
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,519
With your skills,

34
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,200
I don't think you need a partner.

35
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:39,200
I'm a royal member.

36
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,119
I'm visiting the royal tombs
to clear my mind, have a stroll.

37
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:45,320
But there's no reason

38
00:02:45,339 --> 00:02:47,040
for you to show up here, is there?

39
00:02:49,499 --> 00:02:51,799
Then why haven't you
called for the guards?

40
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,699
That's because I want you
to owe me a favor.

41
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,440
Can't have you saving me every time.

42
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,000
I have my pride.

43
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,079
Since you're here to clear your mind,

44
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,200
I won't disturb you
chatting with your ancestors, then.

45
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,440
What is this place?

46
00:03:26,059 --> 00:03:27,799
Looks like the royal rumors are true.

47
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,519
To get to the center
of the Royal Cemetery,

48
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:31,720
one has to pass through
the Maze of Illusions.

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,279
I wasn't going to enter the cemetery.

50
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:36,679
I only wanted to grab
the thing I wanted and leave.

51
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,119
Wanting to leave now

52
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,459
isn't going to be that easy.

53
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,399
Stay close.

54
00:03:43,619 --> 00:03:44,480
Chuxia.

55
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,880
Liang Junye.

56
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:49,639
How much longer
are you going to keep it from me?

57
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,079
Liang Junye.

58
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:52,329
Liang Junye!

59
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,259
Where are you, Liang Junye?

60
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:53,979
Liang Junye!

61
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,218
Ling Chuxia.

62
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:55,919
Who is it?

63
00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:57,639
Stop with the tricks.

64
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:05,560
Blue Grass pollen?

65
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:08,200
It is written in medical books

66
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:11,119
that the Blue Grass pollen
has hallucinogenic effects.

67
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,600
It causes people to become confused.

68
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,399
Ling Chuxia.

69
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,240
Who are you?

70
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,760
Do you not recognize your own self?

71
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,440
I am you.

72
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:28,839
Ling Chuxia.

73
00:04:29,299 --> 00:04:30,599
What are you doing?

74
00:04:31,179 --> 00:04:32,240
Liang Junye.

75
00:04:34,219 --> 00:04:36,719
You like me, don't you?

76
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,399
Don't be ridiculous.

77
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:39,880
Why would I...

78
00:04:45,739 --> 00:04:46,880
You're not Ling Chuxia.

79
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,959
What do you mean I'm not Ling Chuxia?

80
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,178
You've been troubled
by what happened before.

81
00:04:53,179 --> 00:04:55,000
Why didn't you tell me?

82
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:57,079
You remember our past?

83
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,738
Of course I do.

84
00:05:00,739 --> 00:05:03,279
When we parted at Yuyao Pass back then,

85
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,719
didn't you

86
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:07,240
think about taking me with you?

87
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,800
It wasn't my intention.

88
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,680
But I couldn't disobey
the emperor's command.

89
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,279
I didn't expect my rash decision

90
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,519
to put you and your family in harm.

91
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,680
Never mind those people.

92
00:05:19,179 --> 00:05:21,240
As long as we're together,

93
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,719
it's all good.

94
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,680
Don't come any closer.

95
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,279
Why won't you face your true self?

96
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,240
If you had learned to please Father,

97
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:32,159
and not just mastering pen and sword,

98
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,479
then your position

99
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,098
in the Prime Minister's Residence
would've been secured.

100
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:40,320
Mastering the pen
means having wisdom and etiquette.

101
00:05:40,859 --> 00:05:43,079
And mastering the sword
means I can protect myself.

102
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:43,939
I have no intention

103
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,599
of becoming a pretty vase
like Ling Qiuqing.

104
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,560
If you fixed your face,

105
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:53,159
you'd be able to marry Lord Ming.

106
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,658
The sparrow will turn into the phoenix,

107
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:58,399
whose power is only second
to the emperor.

108
00:05:59,179 --> 00:06:00,680
Who would dare bully you, then?

109
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,479
My marriage

110
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:06,240
is not some bargaining chip
to gain power.

111
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:09,039
I am not marrying someone I do not love.

112
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:10,399
Then,

113
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,039
what about Lord Ling?

114
00:06:14,299 --> 00:06:15,360
Liang Junye?

115
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,920
Isn't he the best candidate for you
right now?

116
00:06:30,859 --> 00:06:32,800
The jade medallion royal heirloom

117
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,599
has the ability
to disperse hallucinations.

118
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:40,399
Liang Junye!

119
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:43,680
Chuxia!

120
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:45,360
Chuxia!

121
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,920
What's wrong, Chuxia?

122
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:48,680
I found the way to escape.

123
00:06:49,179 --> 00:06:50,000
Chuxia.

124
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:52,360
(She is poisoned.)

125
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,560
You want the Blue Grass
to cure the poison.

126
00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:56,719
Why didn't you say so earlier?

127
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:12,440
(It was Liang Junye
who brought me back.)

128
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,800
(Did he leave this here, too?)

129
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:39,680
(I finally got rid
of the Supreme Poison.)

130
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:41,240
Liang Junye.

131
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,039
This time,

132
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:46,959
I owe you one.

133
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,538
If Your Highness

134
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:50,760
really wants to win over
Young Lady Ling,

135
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,639
I do have some ideas.

136
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:54,379
It could help Your Highness

137
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,240
and make Young Lady Ling
slowly change her mind about you.

138
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,599
Do tell.

139
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:01,320
What should I do to win her back?

140
00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:03,200
