(Adapted from Xiao A'man's novel)

00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,050
("After the Ugly Concubine Divorced,
She is Wooed By Big Shots of the Capital.")

00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,100
=Episode 21=

4
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,760
My Lord, Eunuch Li is here.

5
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,400
Good day, Eunuch Li.

6
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,679
Take it slow, Your Highness.

7
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:00,120
Careful.

8
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,919
This lady is...

9
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:05,919
It's because of my frail health.

10
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:08,680
I heard First Young Lady Ling
is a skilled physician.

11
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:11,359
So I came to the residence
to seek her help.

12
00:01:11,699 --> 00:01:12,919
Hence why I had to trouble you

13
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:14,760
to bring my medicine
to the General's Residence.

14
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,040
You're being too courteous,
Your Highness.

15
00:01:19,059 --> 00:01:21,138
It's time to deliver

16
00:01:21,139 --> 00:01:23,120
your medicine anyway.

17
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,200
I wouldn't dare to keep you waiting.

18
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,179
If you didn't take the elixir
given by His Majesty on time,

19
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,040
that would be a problem.

20
00:01:43,419 --> 00:01:44,919
As expected from my brother's medicine.

21
00:01:46,419 --> 00:01:47,519
After taking it,

22
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,639
I feel my strength coming back.

23
00:01:52,419 --> 00:01:54,919
I won't take up more
of Your Highness' time, then.

24
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,639
Right, there's one more thing.

25
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,120
His Majesty's birthday is coming up.

26
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:03,480
Remember to return
to the palace

27
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:05,320
to attend the banquet.

28
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,999
Yes, definitely.

29
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:10,600
I will be there with gifts.

30
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:13,200
Liefeng,

31
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:15,040
see Eunuch Li out.

32
00:02:15,059 --> 00:02:15,799
Yes, my Lord.

33
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,799
Junye.

34
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:23,579
Junye.

35
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,799
Help me to my bed.

36
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:26,119
Come.

37
00:02:31,779 --> 00:02:33,040
You knew it was poison.

38
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:35,280
Why did you still drink it?

39
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,359
Now you know how difficult
my life has been

40
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:40,839
over the years.

41
00:02:41,339 --> 00:02:44,040
Do they send the medicine
regularly for you to drink?

42
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,639
My brother has always been wary of me.

43
00:02:49,779 --> 00:02:51,519
But he's trying to kill you.

44
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,799
So be it.

45
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,639
Now you have me.

46
00:02:56,499 --> 00:02:58,119
I won't let anything happen to you.

47
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,000
I know.

48
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,720
But we now have an opportunity.

49
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,200
We can enter the palace on account
of my brother's birthday celebration.

50
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,560
Then we'll sneak into the royal study.

51
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:13,280
But I'm currently
not in the best condition.

52
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:16,799
So I'm afraid you'll have
to do the work, Chuxia.

53
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,679
In order not to attract attention,

54
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,760
you'll have to put on a disguise.

55
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:28,079
You'll enter the palace
as my personal servant.

56
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:30,320
We'll play it by ear.

57
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,560
I thought you'd not want to see me again

58
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:36,839
after what happened.

59
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:39,280
I'm not that petty of a person.

60
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,040
It's just that Father has been
planning for my wedding.

61
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:44,679
You're set to marry?

62
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,720
Are you asking
about my future husband?

63
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,419
Or...

64
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,519
One move is not enough to show wisdom.

65
00:03:50,619 --> 00:03:52,560
One strum of the string
is not enough to express sadness.

66
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:54,778
If I'm unable to give an answer,

67
00:03:54,779 --> 00:03:56,799
then I won't simply bring it up.

68
00:03:58,339 --> 00:03:59,859
But it's my utmost wish

69
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,239
for you to find happiness.

70
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:04,498
People say life is like playing chess.

71
00:04:04,499 --> 00:04:05,799
No regrets after making a move.

72
00:04:06,339 --> 00:04:08,679
I enjoy playing chess with you

73
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,098
because I wish to learn
to cherish and let go.

74
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:12,839
Know when to advance and retreat.

75
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,519
Princess,

76
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,000
you know my true feelings.

77
00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:20,479
So why bother?

78
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:28,639
What's taking so long?

79
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,399
Are you pleased, Your Highness?

80
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,159
Very pleased.

81
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,200
Come on. We'll go some place
for you to practice.

82
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:47,279
It's taken the bait!

83
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:49,000

88
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,159
I'm the lord again?

89
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,599

I'm getting bored.

Why don't you sing a song?

112
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,599
Your Highness.

113
00:06:49,179 --> 00:06:51,719
I'm only good with the sword.

114
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:54,159
I can't sing.

115
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,839
Would you like to see?

116
00:06:59,179 --> 00:06:59,959
Forget it.

117
00:07:10,859 --> 00:07:13,320
I really put the foot in my mouth.

118
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,240
Why did I try to tease you

119
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,800
and make you pretend
to be my servant?

120
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,320
Why?

121
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:28,079
Are you not happy with my service?

122
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,680
Not at all.

123
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:32,360
You're doing a terrific job.

124
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,200
It's just that I'm not meant
to enjoy the good treatment.

125
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,920
Go back and get changed.

126
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:41,880
Later, we'll go to
the palace banquet together.

127
00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:43,240
I'll find a way

128
00:07:43,299 --> 00:07:44,959
to let you act on your own.

129
00:07:47,299 --> 00:07:49,320
Remember, safety first.

130
00:07:49,859 --> 00:07:51,599
Avoid direct confrontation
if anything happens.

131
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:56,800
Junye.

132
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,120
When we find out the truth,

133
00:08:03,299 --> 00:08:04,719
let's leave this place.

134
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,560
You can be the lackadaisical prince.

135
00:08:07,299 --> 00:08:08,800
And I'll be the lackadaisical princess.

136
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,760
That's for sure.

137
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:12,819
But right now,

138
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,639
we have other things to take care of.

139
00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:18,079
You're right.

140
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,200
The residual poison in your body
hasn't been cleared.

141
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,599
Don't worry.

142
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,000
It's only a banquet.

143
00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:28,680
I can handle it.

144
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,160
Uncle is here to attend
Father's birthday banquet, right?

145
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,379
But it looks like

146
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,959
you have good news to share.

147
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:51,520
I don't mind telling you, Uncle.

148
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:52,818
Father

149
00:08:52,819 --> 00:08:54,879
will be nominating me
as the Crown Prince.

150
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:56,640
More importantly,

151
00:08:56,699 --> 00:08:59,320
he will once more bequeath
Chuxia to me.
