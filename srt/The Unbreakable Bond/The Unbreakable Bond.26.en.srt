=The Unbreakable Bond=
(Adapted from Xiao A'man's novel)

00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,020
("After the Ugly Concubine Divorced,
She is Wooed By Big Shots of the Capital.")

3
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,100
=Episode 26=

4
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,639
You're here, Chuxia.

5
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:51,559
Greetings, Your Royal Highness.

6
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,239
What is this?

7
00:00:53,979 --> 00:00:56,319
You and I need not stand on ceremony.

8
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,639
Your Royal Highness is soon to be
Great Yue's emperor.

9
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:01,959
It's only right to practice decorum.

10
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,960
May I know why

11
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,418
you asked me to come today?

12
00:01:06,419 --> 00:01:07,639
Your behavior

13
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,439
is making it awkward.

14
00:01:11,059 --> 00:01:12,040
Right.

15
00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:14,040
Who would've thought

16
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:16,919
I'd eventually become the Crown Prince?

17
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:19,159
Chuxia,

18
00:01:19,339 --> 00:01:21,320
although I designated Luoluo
as the Crown Princess,

19
00:01:21,419 --> 00:01:23,079
it doesn't mean
I've forgotten about you.

20
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,600
If you're willing,

21
00:01:28,419 --> 00:01:30,279
I can ask Luoluo to vacate the seat.

22
00:01:31,339 --> 00:01:33,279
Please don't do that,
Your Royal Highness.

23
00:01:34,139 --> 00:01:36,040
If Luoluo found out,

24
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:37,600
she'd surely be upset.

25
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,279
She's stayed by your side for so long.

26
00:01:40,339 --> 00:01:41,799
Did you not notice

27
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:43,240
her feelings for you?

28
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,079
Moreover,

29
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,960
I've given my heart to Lord Ling.

30
00:01:49,499 --> 00:01:51,480
I'm sure you could tell
we're in a relationship.

31
00:01:53,059 --> 00:01:56,559
I just don't want to leave any regrets.

32
00:01:56,619 --> 00:01:57,519
Regrets?

33
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,279
Why would it be a regret?

34
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:03,960
When I was ugly,

35
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,079
you had no interest in me.

36
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,280
But after I regained my looks,

37
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:11,639
your impression of me changed.

38
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,639
What I want is not someone
who cares about looks.

39
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:17,859
No, Chuxia. I was...

40
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,760
Say no more, Your Royal Highness.

41
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,040
Or else you might ruin

42
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:23,880
any past affection we had.

43
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:26,239
Now,

44
00:02:27,059 --> 00:02:29,440
you're about to become
Great Yue's powerful emperor.

45
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:31,639
I wouldn't dare to go against you.

46
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,399
But if you do it by force...

47
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:36,338
Chuxia!

48
00:02:36,339 --> 00:02:37,799
I'm willing to die
to show my resolution.

49
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,378
Chuxia,

50
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,119
I would never force you in any way.

51
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,880
When Father was alive, when he was about
to appoint me as Crown Prince,

52
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:53,979
my first request was

53
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,720
for me to wed you once more.

54
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,239
If not because of...

55
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:04,160
Luoluo asked me this before.

56
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:06,000
Why am I so attached to you?

57
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,799
Why do I like you so much?

58
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,359
I didn't answer her then.

59
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,200
Now,

60
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,000
what you said...

61
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,320
It finally made me comprehend.

62
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,320
Chuxia.

63
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,440
You may go.

64
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:39,959
I take my leave.

65
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:02,280
My lord, your hand.

66
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:05,440
It's fine.

67
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:06,799
I just bumped it.

68
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:08,119
My lord,

69
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,600
why are you feeling bad?

70
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,440
You have me to keep you company.

71
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,360
As well as your child,
staying by your side.

72
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,039
My child?

73
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,760
When did this happen?

74
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,800
I just found out today.

75
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,200
Although the Preceptor is gone,

76
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,079
I promise to take good care of you.

77
00:04:43,859 --> 00:04:45,839
I found this letter
in the secret chamber.

78
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,320
Maybe it got mixed up
among the other letters.

79
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,079
(Dear Lord Ling.)

80
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:55,120
(Since bidding farewell at Yuyao Pass,)

81
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,560
(I'm pleased to learn
that Your Highness)

82
00:04:57,779 --> 00:04:59,519
(has been keeping a low profile
in Shuhuang.)

83
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,120
(May you be safe and sound
and your wish granted.)

84
00:05:04,659 --> 00:05:06,200
When a Shuhuang native is born,

85
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,619
this mark is tattooed on

86
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,200
using Red Yin grass ink.

87
00:05:09,219 --> 00:05:11,699
How did you know that corpse cicada
came from Shuhuang?

88
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,839
Corpse cicadas are found
only in Shuhuang.

89
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,680
You seem to know a lot about Shuhuang.

90
00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:18,519
Why are you so interested
in the Yuyao Pass incident?

91
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:20,440
Because it concerns
an old friend of mine.

92
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,240
Liang Junye.

93
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,639
How much of what you said
is true and false?

94
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,880
What are you hiding from me?

95
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,658
You're here, Jiang Li.

96
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:36,939
You said you have a task for me.

97
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,800
What is it?

98
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,039
I read the letter.

99
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:42,560
Help me look into
the person mentioned in the letter.

100
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,639
Do you mean Liang...

101
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:53,560
Lord Ling.

102
00:05:54,859 --> 00:05:55,639
Mr. Baili.

103
00:05:56,779 --> 00:06:00,120
What were you mumbling about
to Jiang Li just now?

104
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:02,719
You two were this close.

105
00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:04,920
It's nothing.

106
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,680
If you're feeling well enough,

107
00:06:14,739 --> 00:06:16,079
you should go back to your mansion.

108
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,920
Staying so long
at the General's Residence

109
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,639
may stir up unwanted rumors.

110
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:23,000
Did I do something wrong?

111
00:06:23,739 --> 00:06:24,778
Why are you chasing me away?

112
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:26,079
Nothing of that sort.

113
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,560
It's just that Your Highness
have stayed a long time.

114
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:30,839
It's time to leave.

115
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,120
Yue,

116
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:36,200
I'm a little tired.

117
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,839
I'm going to take a rest.

118
00:06:43,179 --> 00:06:44,880
Give her some space.

119
00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:46,440
Maybe she's in a bad mood.

120
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,120
I think you should let her be.

121
00:07:00,659 --> 00:07:01,440
Liefeng.

122
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,279
What do you think of my letter?

123
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,019
Your Highness' writing is excellent,

124
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,320
sincere and moving.

125
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,379
Too bad she's not reciprocating

126
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,639
my feelings.

127
00:07:15,219 --> 00:07:16,719
What is she up to these days?

128
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,880
My lord.

129
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,139
I bribed Jiang Li

130
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,699
with a lot of darts
and poisoned needles

131
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,440
in exchange for the valuable intel.

132
00:07:23,179 --> 00:07:23,920
Tell me.

133
00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:26,159
If it's indeed valuable,
you will be rewarded.

134
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,899
Recently, First Young Lady Ling

135
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,418
has been reading medical books
in the study

136
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:31,839
and going for walks with Mr. Baili.

137
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,560
She didn't do anything else.

138
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,599
You call that valuable?
Receive your punishment.

139
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:40,959
I should at least be credited
for my efforts.

140
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,079
So she's been idle these few days.

141
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:45,159
Why is she angry with me, then?

142
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:48,440
I know.

143
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:50,680
It must be because
I didn't write enough.

144
00:07:52,859 --> 00:07:55,059
Looks to me like Your Highness

145
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,599
is out of ideas.

146
00:07:56,859 --> 00:07:57,880
Shut it.

147
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,479
Deliver the letter.

148
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,240
We're still delivering?

149
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,360
Why?

150
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,039
Do I have to get your permission

151
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,560
before I do anything now?

152
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,360
Will do, my lord.

153
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,260
(To Ling Chuxia)

154
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,399
Something seems to be weighing
on your mind today.

155
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:26,920
No, there isn't.

156
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,680
I'm sure there is.

157
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,778
Don't forget. When you were little
and something was on your mind,

158
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:33,160
I could tell right away.

159
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,599
I've made you worry.

160
00:08:37,819 --> 00:08:39,599
You're my only family.

161
00:08:39,699 --> 00:08:41,239
How can I not worry?

162
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,759
Then, haven't you thought about
getting a new family member?

163
00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:49,320
Like Princess Ziyuan?

164
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,119
I guess we're not meant to be.

165
00:08:56,299 --> 00:08:59,320
Do you trust her though?

166
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:00,359
I do.

167
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,160
But what if one day,

168
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,239
you realize the person you trusted

169
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:09,079
can no longer be trusted.

170
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:12,079
