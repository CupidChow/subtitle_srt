4
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,179
Let me go!

5
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,739
I need to find Mother!

6
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,338
Uncle and Grandfather are still there!

7
00:00:49,339 --> 00:00:50,779
I need to go back and find them!

8
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,639
Chuxia!

9
00:00:52,339 --> 00:00:55,440
Yue, you were never
this fierce to me before.

10
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:56,919
Chuxia, don't be afraid.

11
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,459
Father told Aunt

12
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,658
that we should leave first.

13
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,120
They'll catch up to us after this.

14
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,319
They'll be fine.

15
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:03,760
Is that true?

16
00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:06,359
Let's go.

17
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,459
(Prime Minister's Residence)

18
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,400
Chuxia,

19
00:01:09,499 --> 00:01:11,539
from now on, you'll be
the first young lady of this residence.

20
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,359
You're no longer related
to the General's Residence.

21
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:16,138
First Young Lady, you've returned.

22
00:01:16,139 --> 00:01:17,519
Come with me.
We need to see His Lordship.

23
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,138
Yue!

24
00:01:21,139 --> 00:01:23,739
Yuyao Pass has been captured.
His Majesty is enraged!

25
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,379
Everyone in
the General's Residence is dead!

26
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,379
Just ignore him!

27
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,418
Come inside!

28
00:01:27,419 --> 00:01:29,639
Chuxia, we're no longer related!

29
00:01:29,779 --> 00:01:31,240
Yue! Hurry! Come inside!

30
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,960
Yue!

31
00:01:34,139 --> 00:01:36,159
Yue!

32
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,079
I couldn't tend to my injuries in time.

33
00:01:47,699 --> 00:01:48,760
That's why I ended up like this.

34
00:01:49,059 --> 00:01:50,639
His Majesty stopped pressing charges

35
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,880
when he saw that I became a cripple.

36
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:55,079
All these years, I studied medicine
and martial arts

37
00:01:55,499 --> 00:01:57,040
just so I could find a cure

38
00:01:57,419 --> 00:01:58,960
for your legs.

39
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:04,719
I've hired all the physicians and
tried all the medicines in the world.

40
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:06,240
I've already given up.

41
00:02:06,419 --> 00:02:07,639
It's just a pair of legs.

42
00:02:08,059 --> 00:02:09,399
Chuxia, you don't need to mind them.

43
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:10,639
Yue.

44
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,679
Mr. Baili.

45
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:16,419
This is?

46
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,658
This is Princess Ziyuan.

47
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:18,919
She's here to learn chess from me.

48
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,818
Mr. Baili, I came here

49
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:24,419
to solve the chess puzzle
you gave me previously.

50
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,239
All right.

51
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:29,440
Yue, I'll stop bothering you.

52
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:31,459
I'll take a stroll around the residence.

53
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,058
Just find De

54
00:02:33,059 --> 00:02:34,160
if you need anything.

55
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:35,519
Understood.

56
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:47,098
First Young Lady Ling is still
the Prime Minister's daughter.

57
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:48,359
She's unmarried.

58
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,019
But now, she's living in your residence.

59
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,320
I'm afraid it's inappropriate.

60
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,880
She can live with me instead.

61
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,399
I can look after her as well.

62
00:02:55,539 --> 00:02:57,040
Now, the General's Residence

63
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,760
is isolated and uninhibited.

64
00:02:59,059 --> 00:03:01,280
No one will pay attention
to this residence.

65
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,160
It's been many years
since I last saw Chuxia.

66
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:04,880
Due to my timidness,

67
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,760
I dare not contact her
for the past decade.

68
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,959
In the current situation,

69
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,919
I can't just leave her in the lurch

70
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:12,519
and push her to someone else.

71
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,200
I was presumptuous.

72
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,200
Mr. Baili, your bond
with First Young Lady Ling

73
00:03:17,339 --> 00:03:18,480
has touched me.

74
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,720
After all, she's my

75
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:22,839
only kin now.

76
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,839
Young Master, Lord Ling has arrived.

77
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,600
Uncle?

78
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,160
What is Lord Ling doing here
all of a sudden?

79
00:03:30,779 --> 00:03:31,600
De.

80
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,799
Your Highness, please wait.
I'll return soon.

81
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:43,880
Yunniang.

82
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,720
Young Lady?

83
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:48,119
Take out the rest of our savings.

84
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,919
Let's renovate the General's Residence.

85
00:03:54,059 --> 00:03:55,560
I'll leave that to you.

86
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:57,720
I'll go and take a walk.

87
00:03:57,819 --> 00:03:58,519
Okay.

88
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,359
Luoluo, come.

89
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:09,320
Luoluo, tell me. What should I do now?

90
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,399
The Prime Minister's Residence
has chased Chuxia away.

91
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,160
Her cousin brought her
to the General's Residence.

92
00:04:14,539 --> 00:04:17,000
It's very difficult for me
to see her now.

93
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:20,120
First Young Lady Ling
has a strong character as well.

94
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,178
Your Highness, it seems like

95
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,800
we can only try
the carrot-and-stick approach.

96
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,059
Maybe I can find an opportunity

97
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,959
to become a close friend of hers.

98
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,298
That way,

99
00:04:30,299 --> 00:04:31,959
we can share intimate topics together.

100
00:04:32,179 --> 00:04:34,259
Your Highness, maybe I can help you

101
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,259
to pursue her as well.

102
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,399
That's great!

103
00:04:36,739 --> 00:04:38,120
What should I do, then?

104
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,880
Yue's leg ailment

105
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:51,079
still has a chance of recovering.

106
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,639
However, as he didn't seek
treatment for many years,

107
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,560
his leg muscles have grown rigid.

108
00:04:57,219 --> 00:04:59,240
Besides providing him
with acupuncture treatment every day,

109
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,519
I also require a rare herb
for his treatment.

110
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,880
It's called Blazing Kirin.

111
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,959
But no one has seen
Blazing Kirin before.

112
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,079
I don't know where I can find it either.

113
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,639
What are you looking for?

114
00:05:22,099 --> 00:05:23,200
What are you doing here?

115
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,000
I was passing by as I had nothing to do.

116
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:30,479
I'm here to visit Mr. Baili as well.

117
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,560
You know my cousin?

118
00:05:34,739 --> 00:05:35,519
Of course.

119
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,599
My Lord.

120
00:05:36,859 --> 00:05:37,939
I thought you already knew

121
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,120
that Miss Chuxia had returned
to the General's Residence last night?

122
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,940
I don't know why you came here
so early in the morning.

123
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,098
And, you were pacing back and forth

124
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:46,639
in front of the door just now.

125
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:48,920
You only entered the room
after getting impatient.

126
00:05:55,859 --> 00:05:58,039
Miss Chuxia, since fate has led us
to encounter each other,

127
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:01,200
would you be willing
to take a walk with me?

128
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,680
If you keep quiet,
I'll take it as a yes, then.

129
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,599
Miss Chuxia, where are you going?

130
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm going to find a herb.

131
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,140
Is the poison in your body
not neutralized yet?

132
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,639
It's not me. It's Yue.

133
00:06:25,299 --> 00:06:27,200
I wish to cure his leg ailment.

134
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,680
I see.

135
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:32,440
Do you have something to tell me?

136
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:35,880
You were waiting at
the residence this morning and all.

137
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,000
I do have a favor to ask of you.

138
00:06:41,179 --> 00:06:42,320
I'm poisoned.

139
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,039
I need your help
to neutralize the poison.

140
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,079
Was it the same poison as last time?

141
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,240
But it's been quite some time.

142
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,200
You should've recovered by now.

143
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,240
I was poisoned again.

144
00:06:56,779 --> 00:06:58,519
My Lord, it's quite easy for you

145
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,079
to be poisoned, huh?

146
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:12,399
It's nothing serious.

147
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,920
It's still the same poison.

148
00:07:14,179 --> 00:07:15,800
You just require
an acupuncture treatment.

149
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,899
You can take my prescriptions

150
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,178
for a few days

151
00:07:19,179 --> 00:07:20,360
if you wish to recover quickly.

152
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:21,760
All right.

153
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,839
If so, I shall move into
the General's Residence today.

154
00:07:24,859 --> 00:07:27,800
My Lord, you intend to move
into the General's Residence?

155
00:07:28,219 --> 00:07:29,039
That's right.

156
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,920
I'm afraid that'll be inappropriate.

157
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:35,599
My Lord, your condition
doesn't require my constant care.

158
00:07:35,859 --> 00:07:39,418
Moreover, Yue will never agree

159
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:41,200
to that notion of yours.

160
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,519
I've already told Mr. Baili about it.

161
00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:46,200
He said I could live there
for a few days.

162
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,279
Yue actually

163
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,959
said yes?

164
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,639
I don't believe you.

165
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,719
I need to ask Yue about this.

166
00:07:58,099 --> 00:07:59,360
I need to know what's going on.

167
00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:01,000
Chuxia!

168
00:08:02,859 --> 00:08:03,619
Chuxia.

169
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,490
I was looking for you
at the General's Residence just now.

170
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,240
Wait, you two are...

171
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,719
What? Are you the only person
who's allowed to have a bosom friend?

172
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,200
Can't I have a bosom friend of my own?
