=The Unbreakable Bond=
(Adapted from Xiao A'man's novel)

00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,020
("After the Ugly Concubine Divorced,
She is Wooed By Big Shots of the Capital.")

00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,100
=Episode 23=

4
00:00:48,019 --> 00:00:48,840
Miss.

5
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,760
How is it with the job
I tasked you to do?

6
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:54,819
Apologies, miss.

7
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,360
I am not doing a good job.

8
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,819
In the past two days of investigating,
I haven't found anything useful.

9
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,760
But...

10
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,219
But what?

11
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,719
The mastermind I've been reluctant
to name is actually Preceptor Yu.

12
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,519
You useless rat.

13
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,919
I told you to follow Ling Chuxia

14
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,799
and get her arrested in the palace.

15
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,760
How did you let her get away?

16
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,200
Jiang Li, you've utterly
disappointed me.

17
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,978
I'm sorry, godfather.

18
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:25,120
I deserve punishment.

19
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:26,459
He's vicious.

20
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,279
He's been plotting against you
and Lord Ling.

21
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:30,858
So it is him.

22
00:01:30,859 --> 00:01:32,359
You already knew?

23
00:01:34,499 --> 00:01:36,559
I was waiting for you
to come clean with me.

24
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:39,999
Now, I need you to do
one more thing for me.

25
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,200
Why did you ask to meet me today?

26
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,719
I'll be frank.

27
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,040
There's a favor I need from you.

28
00:01:54,059 --> 00:01:57,120
I reckon it's about Lord Ling?

29
00:01:58,419 --> 00:01:59,240
Yes.

30
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,079
I hope you'll be able to help

31
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:02,519
persuade Lord Preceptor

32
00:02:02,699 --> 00:02:04,159
to allow me to see him.

33
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,120
It could be our last meeting.

34
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,040
Since you've asked,

35
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,259
I'll surely help.

36
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,399
This favor

37
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:15,079
is within my means.

38
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:17,440
Thanks a lot.

39
00:02:19,499 --> 00:02:20,320
Junye.

40
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,320
Junye!

41
00:02:21,779 --> 00:02:22,600
It's me.

42
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,440
Chuxia.

43
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,480
I asked Yu Luoluo
to help me sneak in here.

44
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,280
She used Preceptor Yu's name

45
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,778
to get rid of the prison guards.

46
00:02:31,779 --> 00:02:32,799
Yu Luoluo?

47
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:34,839
Chuxia,

48
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:36,799
you must know who it is
that framed me.

49
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,679
Yu Luoluo can't be trusted.

50
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,079
I'm pretty sure Preceptor Yu
set you up.

51
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:43,799
But as for Luoluo,

52
00:02:44,659 --> 00:02:46,359
she was willing to help me this time.

53
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:49,299
That means she's probably
in the dark

54
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,639
about her father's evildoing.

55
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,658
Junye, there's no time.

56
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:55,058
Tell me what happened

57
00:02:55,059 --> 00:02:56,019
that night

58
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,679
so that I can think of a way
to get you out.

59
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,919
Brother seemed
to have died from poisoning.

60
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,119
He was bleeding black blood
through his nose and eyes.

61
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,600
It's as if he was given a chronic poison

62
00:03:06,779 --> 00:03:08,119
and it became fatal.

63
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,959
I'm sure Preceptor Yu had something
to do with the Yuyao Pass incident.

64
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:13,919
Otherwise, he wouldn't be so fearful
of us investigating the matter.

65
00:03:15,219 --> 00:03:16,040
Junye,

66
00:03:16,499 --> 00:03:17,359
don't worry.

67
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,959
The truth will come to light soon.

68
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:21,880
I promise to get you out of here.

69
00:03:24,779 --> 00:03:25,519
Here.

70
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:29,919
What's this?

71
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:31,299
I got someone to make it.

72
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,519
It's an exact replica
of the one you gave me.

73
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:35,519
Try it.

74
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,959
Ring the bell.

75
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,880
Next time you're in danger,

76
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,200
ring the bell.

77
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,079
I too, shall appear before you.

78
00:03:53,339 --> 00:03:55,299
Okay, my time is up.

79
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,320
I have to go.

80
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,079
Wait for my good news.

81
00:03:58,499 --> 00:03:59,320
Chuxia.

82
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,218
I do not believe

83
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,919
that Uncle could've killed Father.

84
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,819
I've known for a long time
that Preceptor Yu

85
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,920
was up to no good.

86
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,240
He's uncontested in the palace.

87
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,839
He doesn't show me any respect.

88
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,039
Now, it seems that

89
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,479
his patience has run dry.

90
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,479
I spoke with Junye in the prison.

91
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,039
As he said,

92
00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:32,959
we have to find evidence.

93
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,719
Yue,

94
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,200
we'll have to act separately.

95
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,440
What's your plan?

96
00:04:51,179 --> 00:04:52,120
Luoluo.

97
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,000
Tell me.

98
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,200
Why did Uncle harm Father?

99
00:05:01,179 --> 00:05:03,360
Things were fine for such a long time.

100
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,658
Why did he

101
00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:09,039
have to do it on Father's birthday?

102
00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:11,599
I don't get it.

103
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,719
I can't figure it out.

104
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:17,279
My lord.

105
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,279
No.

106
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,719
I should address you
as Royal Highness.

107
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,959
I don't know anything
about imperial affairs.

108
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,440
But surely it's not a surprise
that royal heirs

109
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,200
desire the throne.

110
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,120
For me,

111
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,120
in the beginning,

112
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:40,639
I only wanted the title of Crown Prince.

113
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:43,680
And marry Chuxia again.

114
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,760
I don't care about
succeeding the throne.

115
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,719
But,

116
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,039
why does it feel like

117
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,479
everything has been predetermined?

118
00:05:57,779 --> 00:05:58,880
Your Royal Highness.

119
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:01,778
There's one thing

120
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,200
I don't quite understand.

121
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:05,159
But I dare not ask.

122
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,680
Just say it, Luoluo.

123
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:22,519
Why do you like Chuxia so much?

124
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,839
Why are you so intent
about marrying her?

125
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,760
Some things

126
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,440
are not up to us to decide.

127
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,639
And some people

128
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,959
cannot be controlled.

129
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,039
Let alone relationships.

130
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,959
Love between man and woman

131
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,639
is as flimsy as cicada's wings.

132
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,800
Once you have a clear answer,

133
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,120
you can tell me then.

134
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,200
I met Lord Ling today.

135
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:22,399
He told me

136
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:23,760
that the emperor's death

137
00:07:23,859 --> 00:07:26,000
could be related to the elixir
he's been taking.

138
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,418
It happens to align
with what you found today.

139
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:30,839
Looks like you're right.

140
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,059
We just have to find

141
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,440
the elixir the emperor had taken.

142
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:35,159
Everything will be revealed.

143
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:52,800
Jiang Li.

144
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,000
I found it.

145
00:07:58,299 --> 00:08:00,880
Just as I thought, it's the
Supreme Poison found only in Shuhuang.

146
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,619
Looks like Preceptor Yu
is indeed connected

147
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,839
to the Yuyao Pass incident.

148
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:14,800
Jiang Li.

149
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,159
Don't you think things have been
going too smoothly for us?

150
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,440
We didn't come across any obstacles.

151
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,719
Logically speaking,

152
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,178
Preceptor Yu wouldn't leave behind
any traces

153
00:08:24,179 --> 00:08:25,360
for people to find.

154
00:08:26,299 --> 00:08:27,360
This is odd.

155
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,240
Maybe Preceptor Yu thought
he had nothing to worry about

156
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,200
since the emperor is dead

157
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,440
and Lord Ling is in prison.

158
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,440
We should get out of here.

159
00:08:47,579 --> 00:08:49,759
So the mantis caught the cicada...

160
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,119
And I'm the preying oriole.

161
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,840
Lord Ling is locked up
in the Heavenly Prison.

162
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,959
His death is imminent.

163
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,800
Ling Chuxia will surely try
to get him out.

164
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,239
Watch her closely.

165
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,680
Report back to me
as soon as you have news.

166
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,879
Yes, godfather. I will do as told.

167
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:08,839
