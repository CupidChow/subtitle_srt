=The Unbreakable Bond=
(Adapted from Xiao A'man's novel)

00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,960
("After the Ugly Concubine Divorced,
She is Wooed By Big Shots of the Capital.")

3
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,000
=Episode 4=

4
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,879
You have graced our residence

5
00:00:45,939 --> 00:00:48,639
by visiting, Your Highness.

6
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,760
Thank you.

7
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:52,040
Prime Minister Ling,

8
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,319
I'll get straight to the point.

9
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,200
I came to break off
the marriage agreement.

10
00:00:56,259 --> 00:00:58,319
It was a misunderstanding,
Your Highness.

11
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,618
It's my fault for not being more strict.

12
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:01,938
I'll summon the girl now

13
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:03,599
to bow and apologize.

14
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,379
Please reconsider, Your Highness.

15
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:08,320
This marriage is after all
bequeathed by His Majesty.

16
00:01:11,419 --> 00:01:13,480
Go and summon Chuxia.

17
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,079
Get her to apologize to Lord Ming.

18
00:01:16,139 --> 00:01:16,819
Your Highness,

19
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:17,819
I brought the tonic

20
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,040
you asked for.

21
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,659
Also, after investigating,

22
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,799
I believe the painting you wanted to find
is among one of Miss Chuxia's dowries.

23
00:01:27,059 --> 00:01:27,978
Miss Chuxia

24
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:30,079
had asked for the dowries
to be returned.

25
00:01:30,139 --> 00:01:32,559
Should I sneak into the Prime
Minister's mansion and steal it back?

26
00:01:32,699 --> 00:01:33,439
No need.

27
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,719
I will go and get it back myself.

28
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,279
In the meantime, I can give this to her,

29
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,999
as thanks her for treating my poison.

30
00:01:42,779 --> 00:01:45,320
You could've just said
you wish to see her.

31
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:48,279
Not like it's the first time
you climbed the walls.

32
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,799
The tea has gotten cold.
Get me a fresh pot.

33
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,320
Yes, Your Highness.

34
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,019
Miss, we really angered
master this time.

35
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,240
What should we do?

36
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,560
If he had treated
my siblings and I equally,

37
00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:10,760
I wouldn't have resorted to this.

38
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:13,720
Let me comb your hair.

39
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:19,239
Miss Chuxia, master wants you
at the main parlor.

40
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:23,000
It's time.

41
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:33,399
Miss, your face!

42
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:39,399
You should've told me
you were coming, Your Highness.

43
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:42,200
(As long as we can become in-laws
with Lord Ming,)

44
00:02:42,339 --> 00:02:45,280
(it's a good deal no matter
which daughter gets married.)

45
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,959
(My beauty will stand out even more
when the ugly thing comes.)

46
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:57,839
(His Highness will surely
be smitten with me.)

47
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,000
What a crowd.

48
00:02:59,339 --> 00:03:00,618
The mansion is quite lively.

49
00:03:00,619 --> 00:03:02,818
Still as arrogant as ever, Ling Chuxia.

50
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:03,760
Impertinent girl!

51
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:06,799
You should admit your wrongdoing!

52
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,839
(Is this girl really Ling Chuxia?)

53
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,480
(Who knew she'd be so stunning)

54
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:29,440
(without the wound on her face?)

55
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,839
What? How could this be?

56
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,299
May I know why I was summoned, Father?

57
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,498
Isn't it obvious?

58
00:03:37,499 --> 00:03:38,899
As the Prime Minister's
eldest daughter,

59
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,200
you were kicked out
the day you got married.

60
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:42,760
Aren't you ashamed?

61
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,639
You got it wrong, Father.

62
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,359
I was the one who divorced Lord Ming.

63
00:03:48,499 --> 00:03:50,280
You dare speak nonsense?

64
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,679
If you still wish to be
a member of this family,

65
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,320
you better kowtow
and ask for forgiveness.

66
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,280
Prime Minister.

67
00:03:57,379 --> 00:03:58,139
Previously,

68
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,658
Chuxia and I simply had

69
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:00,919
some misunderstanding.

70
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:01,699
Well,

71
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,119
if Chuxia is willing to come back
to the residence,

72
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,259
I'm willing to let it slide.

73
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,160
I won't pursue it.

74
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:14,919
I merely cured the red mark
on my face

75
00:04:15,499 --> 00:04:18,360
and Your Highness' demeanor
suddenly changed.

76
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:21,880
Very thick-skinned, aren't we?

77
00:04:22,739 --> 00:04:23,418
Ling Chuxia!

78
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:25,639
If Your Highness was so absent-minded

79
00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:27,519
that you lost the divorce paper,

80
00:04:27,859 --> 00:04:31,000
I don't mind writing another one.

81
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,680
Father, if there's nothing else,

82
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,079
I will go back and reflect in solitude.

83
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,279
Your Highness...

84
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:46,000
Hey, father-in-law?

85
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,519
Forget what I said today.

86
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,959
Yes, forget it.

87
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,298
Miss.

88
00:04:54,299 --> 00:04:55,839
Miss, what's the matter?

89
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,360
The red mark on your face has recovered.

90
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,079
Why are you vomiting blood?

91
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,000
No.

92
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,320
This is another kind of poison.

93
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,039
Because of the red mark poison,

94
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,440
the two balanced each other out.

95
00:05:12,859 --> 00:05:14,920
Now that the red mark poison
has been cured,

96
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,839
the other one

97
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,000
is flaring up.

98
00:05:19,859 --> 00:05:20,680
Yunniang,

99
00:05:20,859 --> 00:05:22,259
go and get me my medicine box.

100
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,178
But...

101
00:05:23,179 --> 00:05:23,978
Don't worry.

102
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:27,159
There's no poison in this world
that I can't cure.

103
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:28,760
I'll get it right away.

104
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,240
It's the Supreme Poison.

105
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,519
Who could it be

106
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:44,440
that wants me dead?

107
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,560
Looks like I'll have to stay longer

108
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:50,560
at the Prime Minister's Residence.

109
00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:51,880
Who's there?

110
00:05:55,859 --> 00:05:57,178
You again.

111
00:05:57,179 --> 00:05:59,120
Are you that reluctant
to see me?

112
00:06:00,739 --> 00:06:02,800
What's the matter this time,
dear Lord Liang?

113
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:04,399
Why, aren't you enthusiastic?

114
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:06,538
You gave me an endearment so quickly.

115
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:07,499
Liang Junye!

116
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,479
Humiliation leads to anger.

117
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:09,978
Now you're calling me by my real name.

118
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:10,738
You...

119
00:06:10,739 --> 00:06:12,079
Don't be mad, miss.

120
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,599
I came to present
an additional thank you gift.

121
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:15,839
Rest assured.

122
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,719
This is a tonic
to improve your cultivation.

123
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,760
I can tell you're a practitioner
of martial arts.

124
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:21,680
So I got this specially for you.

125
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,719
You keep on helping me.

126
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,959
I don't suppose
it's merely to repay me, right?

127
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,699
You're very perceptive.

128
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,519
It's true that I have a favor to ask.

129
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,719
Do you have in your possession
the Rainy Mountain painting?

130
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,819
I heard the former emperor

131
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,079
had gifted the famous painting
to your grandfather.

132
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:48,259
Could I have it?

133
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,159
Why do you want the painting?

134
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:53,279
Just think of it as an interest in arts,

135
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,120
so I'd like to own the famous painting.

136
00:06:58,659 --> 00:06:59,560
Chuxia?

137
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,560
What are you doing here?

138
00:07:01,859 --> 00:07:04,079
Could it be that you changed your mind?

139
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,499
Luoluo.

140
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,599
Your Highness.

141
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,920
What... What's up with your outfit?

142
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,920
What's wrong with it?

143
00:07:16,739 --> 00:07:17,519
It's nothing.

144
00:07:18,179 --> 00:07:20,560
I just mistook you for Chuxia.

145
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,159
Don't mind me.

146
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:27,279
I briefly met Miss Chuxia once before.

147
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,039
She is indeed a standout beauty.

148
00:07:29,299 --> 00:07:30,719
I pale in comparison.

149
00:07:31,859 --> 00:07:33,360
Is that really what you think, too?

150
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,760
I don't have any use for this painting.

151
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:41,200
So I'll gift it to Your Highness

152
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,440
as courtesy.

153
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:46,560
The pills you gave me,

154
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,200
how many more do you have?

155
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,920
If you need them,

156
00:07:51,299 --> 00:07:52,639
you need only ask.

157
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,839
Thank you, miss.

158
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,519
You saw my face,

159
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,599
but why aren't you surprised?
Same as before.

160
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,079
Surprised? Why?

161
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:05,880
No matter how you look,

162
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,839
you're the same in my eyes.

163
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,000
That's because

164
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:11,360
I see with my heart.

165
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:16,880
I have to self-reflect in solitude.

166
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:18,839
I won't see you out.

167
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,760
I shall not disturb you, then.

168
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,120
(Is getting too close to Lord Ling)

169
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,880
