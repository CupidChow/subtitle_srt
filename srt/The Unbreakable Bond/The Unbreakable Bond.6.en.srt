00:00:36,984 --> 00:00:38,780
=The Unbreakable Bond=
(Adapted from Xiao A'man's novel)

2
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,960
("After the Ugly Concubine Divorced,
She is Wooed By Big Shots of the Capital.")

3
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,000
=Episode 6=

4
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:50,120
Your Highness.

5
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,099
The task at the Royal Cemetery
has been delegated.

6
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,720
Workers will build a new stone door.

7
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,440
Alright.

8
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,879
I thought I'd find new clues
at the cemetery.

9
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,279
But I got nothing.

10
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,219
Looks like

11
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,480
the only lead now
is the Rainy Mountain painting.

12
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:06,840
Go to the Prime Minister's Residence

13
00:01:07,059 --> 00:01:08,698
and find out how Chuxia is doing.

14
00:01:08,699 --> 00:01:12,240
Miss, are we really going to say that?

15
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:17,120
I'm ready.

16
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:19,159
Have you heard?

17
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:20,778
Young Lady Chuxia has suddenly turned

18
00:01:20,779 --> 00:01:22,159
into a stunning beauty.

19
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,840
Yes, I think it really happened.

20
00:01:24,059 --> 00:01:26,519
Lately, Lord Ming
has been visiting a lot.

21
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,138
Miss,

22
00:01:28,139 --> 00:01:31,040
are you really going
to remarry Lord Ming?

23
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,719
His Highness has agreed.

24
00:01:34,059 --> 00:01:36,739
In three days, he will come
to take my hand in marriage.

25
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:37,819
Did I hear it wrong?

26
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,400
I have to inform Young Lady Qiuqing!

27
00:01:40,779 --> 00:01:43,639
Will I also become prettier
after using this?

28
00:01:45,779 --> 00:01:46,778
Miss, bad news!

29
00:01:46,779 --> 00:01:48,498
Ling Chuxia is going
to remarry Lord Ming!

30
00:01:48,499 --> 00:01:49,400
What?

31
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,698
Will doing this

32
00:01:52,699 --> 00:01:54,218
really bait the person

33
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:55,400
who secretly poisoned you?

34
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,880
Don't worry.

35
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,680
If my prediction is right,

36
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,480
they will take action very soon.

37
00:02:03,059 --> 00:02:04,218
It's a hot day.

38
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:06,320
You should rest in your room, miss.

39
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,960
Despite the weather,

40
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,359
Summer Wind Hall didn't allocate
any ice to us.

41
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,799
Chuxia, Chuxia!

42
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,938
I was concerned
that your frail physique

43
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:22,359
wouldn't be able
to take the summer heat.

44
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,480
So I purposely brought you
some cooling goods.

45
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:26,579
Hurry up and put them inside.

46
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,139
- Yes.
- Yes.

47
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,200
Quickly.

48
00:02:28,499 --> 00:02:31,359
You certainly brought the ice
right on time.

49
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:33,880
Of course. I'm happy to do anything

50
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,720
so long as I get a smile from you.

51
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,880
Your Highness, what are you doing here?

52
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:42,560
I prefer quiet and serenity.

53
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:44,040
I don't like crowds.

54
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,440
Could Your Highness see the guest off?

55
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,040
Exactly what I was thinking.

56
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,218
Retainers,

57
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:51,538
take Young Lady Qiuqing
back to her room.

58
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:52,538
Yes, Your Highness.

59
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,280
- Young Lady Qiuqing, this way.
- Go on, then.

60
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,839
Take care of her.

61
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,079
Ling Chuxia.

62
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:05,560
I'm liking you more and more.

63
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:09,079
I won't give up.

64
00:03:11,499 --> 00:03:12,538
Mother!

65
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:14,699
Ling Chuxia is marrying Lord Wang again.

66
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,600
What?

67
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,538
Mother, you have to speak up for me.

68
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:20,720
You can't let that ugly thing
marry Lord Ming.

69
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:23,160
Look at your face.

70
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,560
Go and wash up.

71
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,500
(Prime Minister's Residence)

72
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,600
Who would've thought Ling Chuxia
could become prettier on her own?

73
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,720
Seems like it's time to use
my beloved again.

74
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,179
I got the news that Miss Chuxia

75
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,519
has safely returned
to the Prime Minister's Residence.

76
00:03:47,619 --> 00:03:49,959
I assume the matter has been resolved.

77
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:52,899
(Ziyuan, Princess)
No need to worry anymore, Mr. Bai.

78
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,159
Thank you for your concern, Princess.

79
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,459
(Bai Liyue, General's son)

80
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,639
I just wonder

81
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,218
if Chuxia forgave me

82
00:03:58,219 --> 00:03:59,799
for leaving without a goodbye back then.

83
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,058
Miss Chuxia wrote so many letters

84
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:04,239
to you.

85
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,799
I reckon you're always on her mind.

86
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,959
So why do you feel so conflicted?

87
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:15,679
Your Highness,

88
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,059
it took me a long time
to find hawthorn jelly today.

89
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,120
Weren't you going
to gift it to Miss Chuxia?

90
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:21,719
How come you're eating it yourself?

91
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,639
No one asked you.

92
00:04:24,859 --> 00:04:26,959
Who said I brought it for her?

93
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,240
Could it be that you climbed the wall

94
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,899
and saw Miss Chuxia
receiving gifts from Lord Ming?

95
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,120
I think you're becoming
more and more brazen.

96
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:38,560
You enjoy it, Your Highness.

97
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,279
Why are you here again?

98
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:00,338
I'm in a bad mood today.

99
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:02,599
What does your mood
have to do with me?

100
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,159
Don't you have any gratitude?

101
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,279
I saved you after all.

102
00:05:07,739 --> 00:05:09,639
And I saved you first.

103
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:16,639
I'm in a bad mood

104
00:05:16,779 --> 00:05:19,159
because I searched high and low
for hawthorn jelly,

105
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,120
hoping it will help someone cool down.

106
00:05:21,859 --> 00:05:23,880
But someone else got there first.

107
00:05:25,299 --> 00:05:27,000
One who is unaccountably solicitous
is hiding evil.

108
00:05:27,179 --> 00:05:28,819
Do you know how many times

109
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,639
my roof had to be fixed
because of you?

110
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,839
Didn't you say you got hawthorn jelly?

111
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:38,920
Where is it?

112
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:46,279
Naturally, it ended up in my stomach.

113
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:48,800
Just leave. I want to sleep.

114
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,839
Is royal etiquette
supposed to be this frivolous?

115
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:54,479
Please be respectful, Your Highness.

116
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,320
It's a corpse cicada.

117
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,200
Someone wants to harm you.

118
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:07,360
This is a corpse cicada.

119
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:08,800
The toxins are in its body fluid.

120
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,338
Corpse cicadas don't live on their own.

121
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:12,320
They appear in the presence
of golden cicadas.

122
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,360
On the contrary, contamination
by golden cicada's body fluid

123
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:17,240
will make someone
more youthful and beautiful.

124
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,880
Miss, why are you still awake?

125
00:06:27,299 --> 00:06:28,599
Who are you?

126
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:30,959
Yunniang.

127
00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:33,360
Do you know what this is?

128
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,039
That's...

129
00:06:35,299 --> 00:06:39,019
I know it. It's a corpse cicada.

130
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,159
How come you know?

131
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,019
What's this?

132
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,200
It's... It's nothing.

133
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:51,240
Liang Junye.

134
00:06:51,299 --> 00:06:53,599
Yunniang has had the mark
since she was little.

135
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:54,658
I've always known.

136
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:57,079
Then do you know that it's a mark
only Shuhuang people have?

137
00:06:57,859 --> 00:07:00,360
Miss, don't be mistaken.

138
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,920
When a Shuhuang native is born,

139
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,880
this mark is tattooed on
using Red Yin grass ink.

140
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:08,159
Red Yin grass
doesn't grow anywhere else.

141
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:09,218
You're obviously from Shuhuang

142
00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:10,538
but you hid it from your lady.

143
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:11,719
What is your intention?

144
00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:14,760
Miss, I may be from Shuhuang,

145
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,760
but I came to Yue since young.

146
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:19,538
I was afraid of people
finding out that I'm from Shuhuang

147
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,240
and would be wary of me.

148
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,200
You and I grew up together.
Of course I trust you.

149
00:07:28,539 --> 00:07:30,599
Corpse cicadas are native to Shuhuang.

150
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:32,959
If you didn't place the cicada,

151
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,200
there must be someone else
in the residence who is from Shuhuang.

152
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,699
I'm not very certain,

153
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,538
but I saw Nanny Gan making

154
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:42,259
a Shuhuang snack one time.

155
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,920
Only Shuhuang people know
how to make the dish.

156
00:07:46,739 --> 00:07:48,560
You mean the one who serves Madam Qu?

157
00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:52,178
So it was her.

158
00:07:52,179 --> 00:07:54,760
Miss, people of Shuhuang
are good with poison.

159
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,000
It's best not to get on her nerves.

160
00:07:58,179 --> 00:08:00,440
Don't worry. I know what to do.

161
00:08:07,299 --> 00:08:09,079
(Nanny Gan)
Madam, everything went well.

162
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,240
Wish to challenge me?

163
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,279
That Ling Chuxia is still too green.

164
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:17,218
That's for sure.

165
00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:18,459
At the Prime Minister's Residence,

166
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,399
Madam Qu calls the shots.

167
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,119
Liang Junye,

168
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:37,680
how did you know that corpse cicada
came from Shuhuang?

169
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:40,259
Corpse cicadas are found
only in Shuhuang.

170
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,280
It's poisonous.

171
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:43,520
If you come into contact
with its toxic fluid,

172
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,280
you'll turn into how you were before.

173
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:53,280
You seem to know a lot about Shuhuang.

174
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:57,040
I know a lot more things.

175
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,280
