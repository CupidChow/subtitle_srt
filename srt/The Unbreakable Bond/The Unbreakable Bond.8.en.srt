00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:45,999
Go.

5
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:47,978
Ling Chuxia.

6
00:00:47,979 --> 00:00:49,520
I'll kill you to avenge Dongyang!

7
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:56,658
You...

8
00:00:56,659 --> 00:00:57,520
Madam Qu.

9
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,239
You better don't sling mud at me.

10
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:02,639
You evil woman!

11
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,218
I saw you standing right beside
Dongyang's corpse.

12
00:01:06,219 --> 00:01:07,600
How dare you deny it!

13
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,659
My Lord, I swear

14
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,919
that his death has nothing to do
with Miss Ling.

15
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:13,960
Father.

16
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,999
I didn't want to say it.

17
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,338
But Ling Chuxia

18
00:01:17,339 --> 00:01:19,418
has always disliked my brother and me
since we were young.

19
00:01:19,419 --> 00:01:20,899
She called us...

20
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,120
What did she call you?

21
00:01:22,699 --> 00:01:24,899
She called us illegitimate kids
with a maid as a mother.

22
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,279
She refused to let us call her sister.

23
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,258
But I never thought

24
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,200
that she would be so evil.

25
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,960
I didn't think that she would
murder Dongyang.

26
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:39,819
So, you were a maid
who washed others' feet.

27
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,559
You...

28
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,418
Take Ling Chuxia to prison.

29
00:01:44,419 --> 00:01:47,680
I will uphold justice
for Dongyang tomorrow.

30
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:48,960
Walk.

31
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:49,698
Walk.

32
00:01:49,699 --> 00:01:51,439
Miss Ling.

33
00:01:55,139 --> 00:01:57,939
We haven't seen each other for two days.
I'm sure Chuxia misses me.

34
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,359
Chuxia!

35
00:02:01,139 --> 00:02:03,439
Lord Ming, Miss Ling is not in her room.

36
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,519
Where is she?

37
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:08,338
She poisoned Mr. Ling
and got him killed.

38
00:02:08,339 --> 00:02:09,639
She has been sent to prison.

39
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:10,919
What did you say?

40
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:15,119
Mother, don't be so sad.

41
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:17,160
You still have me.

42
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,079
You?

43
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,699
You are nothing compared to Dongyang.

44
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,560
Mother.

45
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,979
What are you talking about?

46
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,579
If it weren't for you,

47
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,280
Dongyang wouldn't have died.

48
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:38,079
Dongyang.

49
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,160
You are dead because of me.

50
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,399
No. It's not.

51
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,519
Ling Chuxia.

52
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:49,959
This is all because of Ling Chuxia.

53
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,799
I will avenge you.

54
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,818
Ling Chuxia.

55
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:12,399
Are you trying to kill me?

56
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,320
Why are you here?

57
00:03:14,339 --> 00:03:15,880
I'm here to save you.

58
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,880
I went to send you some desserts.

59
00:03:18,059 --> 00:03:19,119
But I heard

60
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:21,079
that you were sent to jail.

61
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,160
Looks like you are quite resourceful.

62
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:32,658
You even know what's happening
in the Ling Residence.

63
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:33,679
Of course.

64
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,560
I have spies in and out
of the Prime Minister's Residence.

65
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,218
I said

66
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,880
that I would win you over.

67
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,320
I'll do everything I can
when it comes to you.

68
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,399
Why haven't you

69
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,000
unlocked the door of this cell?

70
00:03:50,619 --> 00:03:51,359
Wait.

71
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:56,200
No.

72
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,079
I can't do this.

73
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,000
You need to agree to one condition.

74
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,480
Do you want to consider

75
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:06,079
marrying me?

76
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,320
I will forgive what you did
and treat you well.

77
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,359
If you say yes,

78
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,160
I'll help you handle your father.

79
00:04:15,619 --> 00:04:19,019
That's quite an attractive proposal.

80
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,079
Of course.

81
00:04:20,659 --> 00:04:22,880
Your sister always glues herself to me.

82
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:24,800
But she is not

83
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:26,800
my cup of tea.

84
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:28,418
You should be proud

85
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:30,159
that I've chosen you.

86
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:38,959
No. Ling Chuxia.

87
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,259
You were just playing with me.

88
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,079
Even if I didn't agree
to your condition,

89
00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:44,159
I could escape by myself.

90
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,839
No. Ling Chuxia, you...

91
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,039
I was wrong.

92
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,880
I shouldn't have threatened you.

93
00:04:51,179 --> 00:04:52,959
But you...

94
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,039
You need to give me a chance.

95
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,719
Come with me now.

96
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,680
Liang Junye, let me go.

97
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,120
You know who I am.

98
00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:08,479
Why were you there?

99
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:10,039
Why was I there?

100
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,920
I should be asking you.

101
00:05:12,219 --> 00:05:13,599
If I didn't arrive in time,

102
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,159
were you going to harm him?

103
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,800
I was just going to frighten him.

104
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:20,240
Tell me.

105
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,839
Just now, were you tempted

106
00:05:22,299 --> 00:05:23,440
by his condition?

107
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:25,819
What has it got to do with you?

108
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,519
I...

109
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,459
Lord Ling.

110
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,599
Looks like you are
quite the eavesdropper.

111
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:35,418
Ling Chuxia.

112
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:37,440
I came here at once when I found out
that you were in trouble.

113
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,440
But you ate well and slept well

114
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,639
in that prison.

115
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,279
I shouldn't have worried about you.

116
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,000
Thank you.

117
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,880
What did you say?

118
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:54,360
Say it again?

119
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,639
You heard it wrongly.

120
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,218
You still haven't told me

121
00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:02,079
why you were sent to jail.

122
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:05,959
Did you ruin Ling Qiuqing's face?

123
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,599
Or did you beat up Madam Qu?

124
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:10,599
Lord Ling.

125
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,200
Why do you have so many questions?

126
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,418
Talk any louder

127
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:16,560
and you'll wake up everyone
in the Ling Residence.

128
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,399
What's wrong?

129
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,978
Are you afraid that someone will see us

130
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:23,200
being together
in the middle of the night?

131
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,039
You...

132
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,560
What trouble are you in?

133
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,680
I'll help you.

134
00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:30,680
I need to look for a type of dessert.

135
00:06:57,659 --> 00:06:58,479
Here you go.

136
00:07:06,739 --> 00:07:07,760
The dessert is poisoned.

137
00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:10,320
That snake

138
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:13,920
has finally made another move.

139
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,699
Mr. Bai.

140
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,418
Bad news!

141
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:17,858
I heard that Mr. Ling

142
00:07:17,859 --> 00:07:19,320
from the Prime Minister's Residence

143
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,880
was poisoned to death by Miss Chuxia.

144
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:24,200
Chuxia will not poison
her own brother to death.

145
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:26,120
There must be a misunderstanding.

146
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,560
The Prime Minister's eldest daughter,
Ling Chuxia, wants to make an appeal!

147
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,760
The Prime Minister's eldest daughter,
Ling Chuxia, wants to make an appeal!

148
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:38,519
The Prime Minister's eldest daughter,
Ling Chuxia, wants to make an appeal!

149
00:07:47,739 --> 00:07:49,920
Who's being so insensible?

150
00:07:50,299 --> 00:07:52,800
Why did someone hit the drum
to make an appeal before dawn?

151
00:08:02,179 --> 00:08:03,560
Lord Ling.

152
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,819
Are you here because of

153
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,440
something urgent?

154
00:08:10,859 --> 00:08:12,680
I'm free this morning.
So, I took a walk and came here.

155
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,139
I can take this chance to see

156
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,560
how you judge a case fairly.

157
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,339
Who are you and why are you here?

158
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,019
My Lord. I am the eldest daughter
of the Prime Minister, Ling Chuxia.

159
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,359
I want to sue my sister, Ling Qiuqing,

160
00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:41,280
for poisoning my brother,
Ling Dongyang, to death.

161
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,119
Please help me investigate the case.
