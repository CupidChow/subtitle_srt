(Adapted from Xiao A'man's novel)

00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,960
("After the Ugly Concubine Divorced,
She is Wooed By Big Shots of the Capital.")

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,000
=Episode 16=

4
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:07,559
The mountains are dyed yellow
by the autumn foliage.

5
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,480
The Qing magistrate accumulates
a mountain of silver.

6
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,799
Liang Junye,

7
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,040
you said it before.

8
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,680
Ring the jade bell

9
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,320
and you'll appear.

10
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,359
I expect you to keep your promise.

11
00:01:27,059 --> 00:01:28,760
Hurry up and wake up.

12
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,218
I was incompetent.

13
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:31,519
I deserve to be punished.

14
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,999
No one could've predicted the accident.

15
00:01:35,499 --> 00:01:38,739
We'll wait for another chance to strike.

16
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,600
No more mistakes.

17
00:01:40,699 --> 00:01:41,519
Yes, my lord.

18
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,540
(Jiang Li, Shuhuang assassin)

19
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,579
Don't push, don't push.

20
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,258
There's enough.

21
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,240
There's enough for everyone.

22
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,179
Don't push.

23
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,480
Give me a bowl.

24
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:58,880
This one is soiled. Don't eat it.

25
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:10,600
It was her.

26
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,239
After all the twists and turns
over the years,

27
00:02:15,499 --> 00:02:17,679
this is how I meet her again.

28
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,639
I suppose I should repay you

29
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,000
for your kindness back then.

30
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:36,639
You're awake.

31
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,040
Careful.

32
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,480
Have you been at my bedside
the whole night?

33
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,639
Of course not.

34
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,098
I spent the morning sword training.

35
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:53,699
I just dropped by

36
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,040
on the way back.

37
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,799
Chuxia.

38
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,160
Did you watch over him the whole night?

39
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:08,720
Keep still.

40
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,919
Your wound is a deep one.

41
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,839
You have to rest for a few more days.

42
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,760
Lie down.

43
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,839
I can't have that.

44
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,040
That would mean

45
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:19,560
you'll have to accompany me
for a few more days.

46
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:20,919
That's too much.

47
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,079
What are you doing?

48
00:03:30,339 --> 00:03:31,839
Giving you acupuncture.

49
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,498
Acupuncture?

50
00:03:33,499 --> 00:03:36,639
Do stab wounds require acupuncture?

51
00:03:38,539 --> 00:03:39,399
Yue,

52
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,919
it's going to get a little messy.

53
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,658
You should go outside.

54
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:47,839
Don't go, Mr. Baili.

55
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,760
Quick, let's go.

56
00:03:50,499 --> 00:03:51,799
Stay, Mr. Baili!

57
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:55,399
Chuxia,

58
00:03:56,059 --> 00:03:57,760
I was just joking.

59
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,040
Chuxia.

60
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,679
Miss Chuxia.

61
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,259
I haven't gotten the herbs

62
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,399
you had asked for.

63
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,399
Now we have the Blazing Kirin.

64
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,760
We're just missing those herbs.

65
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,200
Oh, no.

66
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,800
Liefeng still hasn't returned
from looking for Yunniang.

67
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,360
That must mean he hasn't found her.

68
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:24,399
Yunniang.

69
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,000
Please be safe.

70
00:04:27,219 --> 00:04:28,178
Miss Chuxia.

71
00:04:28,179 --> 00:04:28,939
Liefeng.

72
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,639
I searched for Yunniang
the whole night last night.

73
00:04:30,859 --> 00:04:32,399
I didn't see her anywhere.

74
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,760
Could something have happened to her?

75
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:37,800
Liefeng.

76
00:04:38,219 --> 00:04:40,000
Take this medicine to Lord Ling.

77
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,360
I'll go and look for Yunniang.

78
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:44,279
Yunniang!

79
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:46,240
Yunniang!

80
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:52,240
(What happened to Yunniang?)

81
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,920
(Where has she disappeared to?)

82
00:04:54,739 --> 00:04:56,639
I know who you're looking for, miss.

83
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,880
Who are you?

84
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,479
Why are you following me?

85
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:01,920
Don't misunderstand, miss.

86
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,298
I know where the person
you're looking for is.

87
00:05:04,299 --> 00:05:06,360
You can stop with your trickery.

88
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,399
It's you, you evil rat!

89
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,079
I'm going to hand you to the magistrate!

90
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:18,418
Do you remember me, miss?

91
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:19,499
When we were kids...

92
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,519
(Young Jiang Li)
This is soiled. Don't eat it.

93
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,560
I went to look for Yunniang

94
00:05:27,859 --> 00:05:29,399
and came across the assassin
from yesterday.

95
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:32,200
Are you hurt?

96
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,719
No.

97
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,360
The assassin was acting oddly.

98
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,560
He told it like it is.

99
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,159
He said Yunniang
was taken by Madam Qu's men.

100
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:43,000
Yes, I tried to kill you yesterday.

101
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:44,939
But because you look like
an old friend of mine,

102
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,699
I held back.

103
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,760
I don't intend to hide it.

104
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:50,379
I was sent by Madam Qu
from your family to kill you

105
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,760
as revenge for her dead son.

106
00:05:52,179 --> 00:05:53,560
As for the person you're looking for,

107
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,440
she was probably taken by Madam Qu.

108
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,599
If you don't believe me,

109
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,399
I could go back to Ling Residence
with you to find out.

110
00:05:59,219 --> 00:06:00,440
I don't know if I should believe him.

111
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,120
Seems like

112
00:06:03,299 --> 00:06:04,920
the person who wants you dead

113
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,639
is none other than Madam Qu.

114
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,599
Hence I'm thinking to go back
to Ling Residence.

115
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,519
If Yunniang is indeed
held captive at the mansion,

116
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:16,719
I have to get her out.

117
00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:18,719
I'll go with you.

118
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,200
You're still injured.

119
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:22,560
You need to rest.

120
00:06:22,739 --> 00:06:24,000
I can go on my own.

121
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:27,760
Chuxia.

122
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,959
Why not ask Liefeng
to scout it out first?

123
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,418
What if this is a trap set up
by the assassin

124
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:33,880
to lure you into it?

125
00:06:34,299 --> 00:06:37,320
That's why he said Yunniang
had been taken by Madam Qu.

126
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,159
Liefeng.

127
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,599
We'll split up, then.

128
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,519
Please go to Ling Residence
and look for clues.

129
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,479
I'll go to the tea house
and check if Yunniang's been there.

130
00:06:49,739 --> 00:06:51,360
I'll wait for you there until 5 o'clock.

131
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,839
If you're not back, I will
immediately head to Ling Residence.

132
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,298
Rest assured, Miss Chuxia.

133
00:06:55,299 --> 00:06:56,719
I will be thorough.

134
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:04,039
Be careful.

135
00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:11,159
Mother gave orders
to capture the ugly thing's maid.

136
00:07:11,299 --> 00:07:13,440
Now we'll just have to wait
for her to walk into the trap.

137
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,560
Watch her closely.

138
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,360
Yes, miss.

139
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:18,159
I have to hurry back and report this.

140
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,260
(Shuiyun Teahouse)

141
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,680
(Yunniang.)

142
00:07:31,299 --> 00:07:32,719
Miss, welcome.

143
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:43,639
Luoluo.

144
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,959
It's you, Chuxia.

145
00:07:48,739 --> 00:07:50,760
You seem restless.

146
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,519
Is there something bothering you?

147
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,360
It's not convenient for me to stand up.

148
00:07:56,739 --> 00:07:59,719
Could you come over for a chat?

149
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,680
Could you come closer?

150
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,880
I came out without my servant today.

151
00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:16,159
I didn't expect

152
00:08:19,739 --> 00:08:21,240
my monthlies to come.

153
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,880
My clothes has been stained.

154
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:24,560
If other people saw it,

155
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,839
