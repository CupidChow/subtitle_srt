=The Unbreakable Bond=
(Adapted from Xiao A'man's novel)

2
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,050
("After the Ugly Concubine Divorced,
She is Wooed By Big Shots of the Capital.")

3
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,100
=Episode 20=

4
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,120
If General Baili

5
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,200
saw how cynical I've become,

6
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,879
he would never allow Chuxia
to marry me.

7
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:53,480
It's all fate at play.

8
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,879
Who could've expected the marriage

9
00:00:56,019 --> 00:00:58,559
would be bequeathed
to next generation's Liang Ziyan?

10
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,120
Anyway,

11
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,559
have you spoken to Chuxia
about when you two were kids?

12
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,600
I only met Chuxia twice as a boy.

13
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,159
She wouldn't have remembered.

14
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:08,960
Besides,

15
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:11,159
I rather not bring up the past

16
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,819
in case it made Chuxia upset.

17
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,159
I remember one time,

18
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,359
it was you and I together.

19
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,439
It was during Chuxia's seventh birthday.

20
00:01:22,339 --> 00:01:23,200
That's right.

21
00:01:24,139 --> 00:01:25,040
Mr. Baili.

22
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,258
Actually,

23
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:28,960
I have something else
to tell you today.

24
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:30,760
I know.

25
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,279
You and Chuxia are already together.

26
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,880
I saw it last night.

27
00:01:35,139 --> 00:01:36,279
It's not that.

28
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,960
It's about the Yuyao Pass incident.

29
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,320
It's not as simple as it seemed.

30
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,600
I know.

31
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,760
After so many years,

32
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,999
the culprit's identity is still
an unknown.

33
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,439
But I recently found a clue.

34
00:01:54,339 --> 00:01:55,519
You want a thorough investigation?

35
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:56,799
It has to be done.

36
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,079
Even if you do,

37
00:01:58,619 --> 00:01:59,439
it's...

38
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,579
Are you thinking that I'm coveting

39
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,880
that position?

40
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,400
If I hadn't relied on General Baili
at the time,

41
00:02:07,699 --> 00:02:09,519
I couldn't have become the Crown Prince.

42
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:11,839
I became everyone's envy.

43
00:02:12,619 --> 00:02:14,000
But no one knew

44
00:02:14,779 --> 00:02:16,119
the price that had to be paid

45
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,720
to sit in that role.

46
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,519
I apologize for judging Your Highness
with my own standards.

47
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,399
Aside from me wanting
to investigate this incident,

48
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,000
there's also Chuxia.

49
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,799
Chuxia?

50
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,320
What you said

51
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,399
is making me feel ashamed.

52
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,720
Chuxia is only a girl,

53
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:45,600
but she has the world in mind.

54
00:02:46,059 --> 00:02:47,839
Whereas I only look at my own misery,

55
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:51,000
confining myself in an imaginary cell.

56
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,880
Does your Highness have any leads?

57
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,979
I found a clue

58
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,239
in the Rainy Mountain painting
belonging to Chuxia.

59
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,839
The clue points to the possibility

60
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,440
that important evidence
of the Yuyao Pass incident

61
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:07,560
could be hidden within
the General's Residence.

62
00:03:08,059 --> 00:03:09,399
The General's Residence?

63
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:12,359
Careful, Mr. Baili.

64
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,440
I've lived here a long time.

65
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,799
But I never noticed anything.

66
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:23,359
Chuxia and I did a search together.

67
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,799
We didn't find anything either.

68
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,440
How do you feel?

69
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,079
My insides are heating up.

70
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:37,760
Like a fire

71
00:03:37,779 --> 00:03:39,919
burning from my chest right to my toes.

72
00:03:41,619 --> 00:03:42,600
What about your leg?

73
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,959
It feels swollen and hot.

74
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,000
But it seems like they're less painful.

75
00:03:49,339 --> 00:03:51,679
Heating up means
the medicine is working.

76
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:54,839
But I have to continue
with the acupuncture.

77
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,560
Coupled with physical therapy,

78
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,359
you should see much improvement.

79
00:03:59,219 --> 00:03:59,959
Come.

80
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:05,959
Careful.

81
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,760
Chuxia.

82
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,639
You've been busy treating my condition

83
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,079
and you're looking gaunt.

84
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,120
No matter what becomes of my leg,

85
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,760
I am grateful to you.

86
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:22,920
I told you.

87
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:24,839
I will make you stand up again.

88
00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:27,599
Chuxia,

89
00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:30,200
are you and Lord Ling...

90
00:04:34,179 --> 00:04:35,039
Yue,

91
00:04:35,299 --> 00:04:37,178
I haven't had the chance to tell you.

92
00:04:37,179 --> 00:04:38,738
It happened just yesterday. We...

93
00:04:38,739 --> 00:04:39,719
Chuxia.

94
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,519
No matter what,

95
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,440
just follow your heart.

96
00:04:43,739 --> 00:04:45,360
I want you to be happy.

97
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,639
One more thing.

98
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,240
Regarding the Yuyao Pass incident,

99
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:50,719
why didn't you tell me?

100
00:04:51,099 --> 00:04:53,039
I thought you'd tell me everything.

101
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:54,880
Don't hold back because of my condition.

102
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,760
Yue,

103
00:04:57,299 --> 00:04:59,000
many things happened lately.

104
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,839
I only found out from Junye

105
00:05:02,179 --> 00:05:03,639
how you would worry about me.

106
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,639
But the most important thing now

107
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,760
is to treat your leg.

108
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:09,719
Junye?

109
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:12,360
Calling him so intimately now, huh?

110
00:05:14,739 --> 00:05:16,000
About the clue,

111
00:05:16,779 --> 00:05:18,800
I'll ask De to find out more.

112
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:21,000
Hopefully we'll find something useful.

113
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:24,599
This leg of mine,

114
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:27,079
whether or not I can stand back up,

115
00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:28,120
I've said it.

116
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:29,440
No matter the outcome,

117
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:32,279
I feel thankful.

118
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:34,880
Because I know someone
really cares about me,

119
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:36,880
the so-called cripple.

120
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:39,959
Yue, stop self-deprecating.

121
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,920
Although you're stuck
within these walls,

122
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:46,240
your heart is devoted to the country.

123
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:47,939
Once I heal your leg,

124
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,639
you too, can become like Grandfather,

125
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:51,839
become a general
who will revitalize the country.

126
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,959
A man should have lofty ambitions.

127
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,720
He must always fight for the cause
of the country.

128
00:05:58,179 --> 00:05:59,760
Fight for the cause of the country...

129
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,360
Junye.

130
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,120
Your wound has healed nicely.

131
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,159
What did you call me?

132
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,440
Don't you dare tease me.

133
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,560
Lately, I'm busy preparing
Yue's therapy.

134
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:18,098
If you've recovered,

135
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:19,760
you should go back to your own mansion.

136
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,680
I don't have time for you.

137
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,680
What's the matter?

138
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,279
The wound has clearly healed,

139
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:32,599
but why do I still feel pain?

140
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:34,880
That's impossible.

141
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,599
I just checked. Let me see.

142
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:43,800
Maybe the pain is in the heart.

143
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,760
Greetings, Father, Mother.

144
00:06:50,299 --> 00:06:53,880
Yan, I plan to make you the Crown Prince

145
00:06:54,299 --> 00:06:56,479
on the occasion of my birthday banquet.

146
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,899
As for the marriage plan
with the Prime Minister's daughter,

147
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,019
I'll pick out another lady

148
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,159
who is more suited
to be the future empress.

149
00:07:06,299 --> 00:07:07,259
Father,

150
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,338
I'd like to choose my own wife.

151
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:12,719
You have someone you like?

152
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,399
It's the same Prime Minister's daughter,
Ling Chuxia.

153
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,139
Looks like my son takes after me.

154
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,800
We're both loyal.

155
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,760
Then,

156
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,320
we'll do as you want.

157
00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:28,639
Thank you, Father.

158
00:07:29,859 --> 00:07:30,719
Careful.

159
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,218
Yue, your condition
has markedly improved.

160
00:07:34,219 --> 00:07:36,279
I'm sure you'll be able
to walk freely very soon.

161
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,680
Thanks to you.

162
00:07:38,219 --> 00:07:38,959
Slowly.

163
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:41,978
Mr. Baili.

164
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:42,800
Lord Ling.

165
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:44,680
Come, taking a walk?

166
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,800
Slowly does it.

167
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,839
It's okay, don't overexert yourself.

168
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:50,880
Chuxia,

169
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,479
the lotus flowers have bloomed.

170
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,760
Let's go take a look.

171
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,399
What flowers? Are you crazy?

172
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,120
Why are you getting jealous over Yue?

173
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,839
This...

174
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,079
Is that where the clue

175
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:08,360
we've been looking for is?

176
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,279
I suppose that was what
General Baili thought, too.

177
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:13,079
The most dangerous place

178
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,680
is the safest place.

179
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:27,959
Looks like we'll have to find the key.

180
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,680
When His Majesty convicted us
and confiscated our assets,

181
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,959
keepsakes of the Bailis
were moved to the palace.

182
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,320
The palace?

183
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:35,959
Right now,

184
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,239
we'll need the Baili hairpin

185
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,719
in order to open the door
to the secret chamber.

186
00:08:42,819 --> 00:08:44,200
To find out the truth,

187
