=The Unbreakable Bond=
(Adapted from Xiao A'man's novel)

00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,020
("After the Ugly Concubine Divorced,
She is Wooed By Big Shots of the Capital.")

3
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,100
=Episode 29=

4
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:47,760
Stop!

5
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:48,999
Stop running!

6
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:50,899
Stop!

7
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:51,840
Split up.

8
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:52,419
Okay.

9
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,200
Over there.

10
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,200
Go.

11
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,139
You guys, go that way.

12
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,160
The rest of you, follow me.

13
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:08,680
Are you scared?

14
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,159
What's there to fear?

15
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,400
Go.

16
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,880
Lord Ling and Ling Chuxia are dead.

17
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,400
What a pitiful pair
of star-crossed lovers.

18
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:32,840
Guess I did them a favor.

19
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:36,999
Mr. Baili.

20
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,719
His Highness...

21
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,698
Lord Ling and Miss Ling are...

22
00:01:40,699 --> 00:01:41,600
What happened?

23
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,858
Did they manage to get away?

24
00:01:42,859 --> 00:01:44,179
They jumped off the cliff.

25
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,120
What?

26
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,600
We've yet to find their bodies.

27
00:01:46,779 --> 00:01:47,639
Chuxia...

28
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:53,519
Young Master.

29
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,279
Hold me.

30
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:05,279
Tighter.

31
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,399
As the Saint of Shuhuang,

32
00:02:10,059 --> 00:02:12,119
I hid in Yue for over a decade,

33
00:02:12,619 --> 00:02:15,239
finding ways to climb to the top.

34
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:17,239
All for the sake that one day,

35
00:02:17,339 --> 00:02:20,280
the people of Shuhuang
could escape from the land of suffering.

36
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:22,679
For them to have a better life.

37
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:33,679
Don't blame me for doing this.

38
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:38,919
The one who becomes attached
is the loser after all.

39
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,299
I've been investigating at night

40
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,519
and discovered

41
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,480
the Shuhuang households
praying to this same painting.

42
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:48,058
Miss Ling was right.

43
00:02:48,059 --> 00:02:50,119
That Yu Luoluo is the Saint of Shuhuang.

44
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,000
So you guys planned this?

45
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,440
When I heard that Chuxia
jumped off the cliff,

46
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,720
I thought I'd never see her again.

47
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:02,399
Your Highness.

48
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,519
Lord Ling.

49
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,399
Mr. Baili.

50
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:05,538
Is Chuxia alright?

51
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:07,359
I escorted Chuxia to the palace,

52
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:09,000
and I'm waiting for her news.

53
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,778
In three days,

54
00:03:10,779 --> 00:03:12,000
we will enter the palace,

55
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:13,720
expose Yu Luoluo's real identity,

56
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,479
and reveal the truth to the world.

57
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,260
(Three days later)

58
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,959
That is all.

59
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:20,919
Court is adjourned.

60
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:21,799
Yes, Your Majesty.

61
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:29,880
Lord Ling?

62
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,799
You're still alive.

63
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,359
Guards!

64
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:35,818
Arrest Lord Ling!

65
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,720
It took me this long to realize

66
00:03:38,059 --> 00:03:40,200
how incredible the empress' acting is.

67
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,019
Even now,

68
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,919
you still won't discard
your fake persona?

69
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:44,639
Fake persona?

70
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:46,200
I don't know what you mean.

71
00:03:48,499 --> 00:03:49,480
Mr. Baili.

72
00:03:51,996 --> 00:03:53,300
(Saint of Shuhuang)

73
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:56,959
The lady in this painting
is the Saint of Shuhuang.

74
00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:00,139
Every Shuhuang native has
to pay respect to her.

75
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,399
Your Royal Highness, take a good look.

76
00:04:03,339 --> 00:04:04,839
Who is this lady

77
00:04:05,499 --> 00:04:06,519
in the painting?

78
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,160
We just happen to look alike.

79
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,679
How could I be from Shuhuang?

80
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,839
My father is Preceptor Yu.

81
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,760
Preceptor Yu was from Shuhuang.

82
00:04:16,219 --> 00:04:18,240
Back then, Lord Hong had wanted
to unite Shuhuang.

83
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,059
To stop that from happening,

84
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,880
Yu Zheng bought an army
and caused the Yuyao Pass incident.

85
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,920
As a result, the General's Residence
was indicted.

86
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,000
And Lord Hong was put on house arrest,

87
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,019
where he died in despair.

88
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,240
So what?

89
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:35,320
I am now Great Yue's empress.

90
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,899
Guards,

91
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,899
arrest these traitors!

92
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,519
What if I say no?

93
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:43,360
What? How?

94
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,599
How did you...

95
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,800
You never thought
you'd make a mistake, huh?

96
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,259
You thought I'd be a puppet

97
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,440
you could control forever.

98
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,279
Empress.

99
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:02,440
(His Highness only has to drink
the antidote I prepared)

100
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,200
(and the hallucinogenic poison
will be cured.)

101
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,120
(Yu Luoluo,
bet you didn't see this coming.)

102
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,440
(We saw through your scheme long ago.)

103
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:12,538
The emperor is not feeling well.

104
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:14,560
Is the plain porridge ready for lunch?

105
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,000
Empress,

106
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:25,120
I cured the emperor's
hallucinogenic poison.

107
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:28,200
Your arrogance and ignorance

108
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,178
have led to your downfall.

109
00:05:30,179 --> 00:05:31,320
Ling Chuxia.

110
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,079
There's a reason why I admire you.

111
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,440
You managed to find
a way around my plan.

112
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,800
Looks like

113
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,858
it's my own fault

114
00:05:39,859 --> 00:05:41,399
you people got your way.

115
00:05:42,859 --> 00:05:44,200
But...

116
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,159
I am now with child.

117
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:50,440
Your Majesty,

118
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:53,338
are you going to kill your own child?

119
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:54,519
Yu Luoluo.

120
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,240
I never thought you'd do this to me.

121
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,240
You...

122
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,159
Considering you are pregnant
with our child,

123
00:06:03,219 --> 00:06:06,459
you will be banished to the Forgotten
Hall to reflect on your actions.

124
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,279
Wait.

125
00:06:07,299 --> 00:06:08,120
Your Majesty.

126
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,240
There's one more thing.

127
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:12,360
While I was treating your poison,

128
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,479
the imperial physician told me

129
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,839
that the empress is not pregnant.

130
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:21,680
She paid the physician
to lie about the pregnancy.

131
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,120
That's not true.

132
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,000
The physician is working for you!

133
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,200
What about me?

134
00:06:26,739 --> 00:06:27,639
Empress,

135
00:06:27,739 --> 00:06:29,839
do you remember Uti fruit
I gave you?

136
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:31,039
In Yue,

137
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,298
pregnant women
avoid the fruit like the plague.

138
00:06:33,299 --> 00:06:35,120
But you had no reservation.

139
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:42,360
How did a master of poison like me

140
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,159
end up losing because of it?

141
00:06:45,179 --> 00:06:46,200
You're wrong.

142
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,560
Uti fruit is not poisonous.

143
00:06:48,859 --> 00:06:52,240
A wolf in sheep's clothing

144
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,760
can't possibly know
a person's true intention.

145
00:06:57,859 --> 00:07:02,200
The emperor had real feelings for you.

146
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,920
Are you okay?

147
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:12,899
I'm fine.

148
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,039
You crazy woman!

149
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,639
Liang Ziyan.

150
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:20,098
Did you really think
I'd actually sleep with you

151
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:21,399
and bear your child?

152
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,200
In your dreams!

153
00:07:23,299 --> 00:07:25,259
The filthy bloodline of Yue

154
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,298
would only taint
the sanctity of Shuhuang!

155
00:07:27,299 --> 00:07:28,479
Yu Luoluo,

156
00:07:28,539 --> 00:07:30,139
I had dreamed about you
staying by my side

157
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,320
as my wife.

158
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,000
But now I see that

159
00:07:34,179 --> 00:07:35,560
I was blind.

160
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,399
I was blinded by beauty.

161
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:39,519
What Chuxia said is right.

162
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:43,120
And now I'm suffering the consequences.

163
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:46,159
Guards, the former empress
has gone crazy.

164
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,360
Arraign her and take her
to the Heavenly Prison.

165
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,159
Yes, Your Majesty.

166
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,240
I was brought up
as the Saint of Shuhuang.

167
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,839
Everything I did was for Shuhuang.

168
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,039
No one ever asked if I was willing.

169
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,680
How I envy you, Ling Chuxia.

170
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:16,000
To me, Great Yue

171
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,639
is just a gigantic Heavenly Prison.

172
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:22,000
I've been locked up in this prison
for too long.

173
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,399
You envy me?

174
00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:25,639
I think

175
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,440
you're just unwilling to accept defeat.

176
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:33,400
Oh, I accept it.

177
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,400
It's just that this end

178
00:08:36,819 --> 00:08:37,499
does not match

179
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,200
my will when I chose to do this
despite knowing its futility.

180
00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:42,479
I put my heart and soul into this.

181
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,680
So the one who should have regrets

182
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,160
isn't me.

183
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,400
Luoluo!

184
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,119
Her face!

185
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,040
Retainers.

186
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,160
Announce my will.

187
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,959
The evidence is clear.

188
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,879
