=The Unbreakable Bond=
(Adapted from Xiao A'man's novel)

00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,020
("After the Ugly Concubine Divorced,
She is Wooed By Big Shots of the Capital.")

00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,100
=Episode 22=

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,119
Father, I wish you
good health and fortune.

5
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,420
May you have a prosperous, long life.

6
00:00:49,881 --> 00:00:50,740
Good.

7
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:56,160
I lost track of the time.

8
00:00:56,161 --> 00:00:57,679
Today is Father's birthday.

9
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,221
I have to go.

10
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,639
Take care, Princess.

11
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,340
De, see the Princess out.

12
00:01:02,481 --> 00:01:03,781
Princess, this way.

13
00:01:05,801 --> 00:01:07,381
(I wonder how Chuxia and Lord Ling)

14
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:09,060
(are doing in the palace.)

15
00:01:09,721 --> 00:01:11,580
Easy with the drinks, Ziyan.

16
00:01:12,081 --> 00:01:13,821
Preceptor Yu isn't here yet, is he?

17
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,000
I am late.

18
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:19,780
Please forgive my tardiness,
Your Majesty.

19
00:01:20,721 --> 00:01:21,580
Take a seat.

20
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:26,440
I heard Lord Ling brought along

21
00:01:26,441 --> 00:01:28,060
a pretty servant.

22
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,039
How come I don't see her?

23
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,340
I worried about her breaking rules
on her first visit.

24
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,741
So she's waiting outside.

25
00:01:51,161 --> 00:01:52,941
A box from the Bailis.

26
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,780
Who's there?

27
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:03,780
I know the way out. Come with me.

28
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,901
Who are you?

29
00:02:05,441 --> 00:02:06,340
It's me.

30
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:07,461
Jiang Li.

31
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,300
Where were you the past few days?

32
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,879
Did you follow me today?

33
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,400
I was taking care
of some personal matters.

34
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,640
I learned about you and Liang Junye
entering the palace today.

35
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,700
I followed you

36
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,180
in case you found yourself
in any danger.

37
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,980
You're acting all mysterious.

38
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,559
How do you expect me to believe you?

39
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,040
I said I'd follow you

40
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,119
and be your weapon to protect you.

41
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,580
I am a man of my word.

42
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,900
I hope you don't doubt me again.

43
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,119
But your actions

44
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,420
aren't making it any easier
to fully trust you.

45
00:02:33,081 --> 00:02:34,839
So are you planning

46
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,420
to betray your original master?

47
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:39,221
I only work for money.

48
00:02:39,361 --> 00:02:40,860
I never had any master

49
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:41,960
to betray.

50
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:43,661
You still won't tell me the truth?

51
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,559
The fact is, I didn't lie about Madam Qu

52
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,700
capturing Yunniang.

53
00:02:47,761 --> 00:02:50,101
Now I'm risking my life
to get you out of the palace.

54
00:02:50,201 --> 00:02:51,501
If you still won't believe me,

55
00:02:51,521 --> 00:02:52,900
I have nothing more to say.

56
00:02:57,361 --> 00:02:58,821
If I need aid some day,

57
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,580
and you get the job done,

58
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:01,860
I will believe you then.

59
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,180
Yes, miss.

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,101
A bunch of idiots.

61
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,300
You let them get away!

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,920
Your Majesty.

63
00:03:15,921 --> 00:03:18,200
I've got news that there's an assassin.

64
00:03:18,201 --> 00:03:19,140
What?

65
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,800
Did you see how that person looked?

66
00:03:22,801 --> 00:03:24,200
It was too dark in the room.

67
00:03:24,201 --> 00:03:25,360
We could hardly see our fingers.

68
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:27,061
We weren't able to see their face.

69
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,781
Lord Ling,

70
00:03:33,921 --> 00:03:36,821
how come only your servant
is not here?

71
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:39,140
Are you suspecting me, sir?

72
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,200
I wouldn't dare.

73
00:03:40,201 --> 00:03:42,980
But as it is, she is
the likeliest suspect.

74
00:03:43,081 --> 00:03:45,381
I have to investigate it thoroughly

75
00:03:45,481 --> 00:03:47,300
to ensure His Majesty's safety.

76
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,541
Father, sorry I'm late.

77
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,439
I wish Father a long and healthy life,

78
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,700
fit as a fiddle.

79
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,580
Good.

80
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,839
An assassin broke into
the palace just now.

81
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,119
I saw Lord Ling's servant girl
alone outside

82
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,159
and got worried,

83
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,020
so I got someone to escort her back.

84
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,140
Miss Chuxia, what are you doing here?

85
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,000
I heard there's an assassin.

86
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:17,140
Are you alright?

87
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,621
Thanks for your concern, Princess.

88
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,760
It's my first time in the palace
and I got lost.

89
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,000
I see.

90
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:23,359
I'll help you get out.

91
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,700
Thank you, Princess.

92
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,421
Why do you have this thing?

93
00:04:35,561 --> 00:04:37,599
Liang Junye gifted it to me
a few days ago.

94
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,900
This is an engagement token
of the royals.

95
00:04:40,761 --> 00:04:43,020
If Uncle gave it to you,

96
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,460
that must mean...

97
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:49,981
She's merely a servant.

98
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:51,741
Thank you for your concern.

99
00:04:53,881 --> 00:04:55,580
Are you reassured, sir?

100
00:04:55,641 --> 00:04:56,741
Your Highness,

101
00:04:57,121 --> 00:04:59,181
I apologize for doubting you.

102
00:05:00,881 --> 00:05:04,421
How come you didn't dedicate
a toast to His Majesty?

103
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:05,900
You may not know this.

104
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,861
I'm not feeling well and cannot drink.

105
00:05:09,201 --> 00:05:11,080
But today is my brother's big day.

106
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:12,821
I don't want to ruin the mood.

107
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:26,821
Come.

108
00:05:31,681 --> 00:05:33,100
I shall take my leave first.

109
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,020
Okay.

110
00:05:45,961 --> 00:05:46,399
Father.

111
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:46,799
Father!

112
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,680
Guards!

113
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,120
Lord Ling poisoned His Majesty!

114
00:05:50,121 --> 00:05:50,719
Arrest him!

115
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,540
Yes, sir!

116
00:05:55,641 --> 00:05:56,941
Young... Young Master.

117
00:05:57,001 --> 00:05:58,140
Something happened.

118
00:05:58,201 --> 00:05:59,821
I got news that His Majesty
had passed away.

119
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:01,501
The entire city is on lockdown.

120
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,100
The palace.

121
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,120
Chuxia is still in the palace.

122
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:06,239
I need to find her.

123
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,100
Young Master.

124
00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:10,279
Yue!

125
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,080
Chuxia,

126
00:06:11,081 --> 00:06:12,061
are you alright?

127
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:13,261
Yue,

128
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,741
you're walking.

129
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,061
Is your leg...

130
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,861
I can walk on my own.

131
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,220
I can walk.

132
00:06:23,881 --> 00:06:24,660
Careful.

133
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,301
Don't rush.

134
00:06:26,441 --> 00:06:27,741
You need to get the hang of it.

135
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:34,020
Lord Ling.

136
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:36,941
You dared to take the life
of Great Yue's emperor

137
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,941
and usurp the throne.

138
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,421
At this time,

139
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,981
we'll have to wait
for the new emperor to be crowned

140
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:44,780
before you are punishment.

141
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,140
Your impatience is showing, sir.

142
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,261
I'd like to see

143
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,399
how the new emperor would punish

144
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,621
me for killing my brother
and usurping the throne.

145
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,981
Such arrogance.

146
00:06:56,961 --> 00:06:58,900
There's one thing I'm curious about.

147
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,479
Why are you so against

148
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,020
me and Ling Chuxia?

149
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,821
Getting rid of you

150
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,181
means Lord Ming
can succeed the throne more smoothly.

151
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,741
As for Ling Chuxia,

152
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,900
you two are trying
to dig up old matters.

153
00:07:13,961 --> 00:07:15,181
I can't have that.

154
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,000
Lock him up.

155
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:16,741
Yes, my lord.

156
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,660
Move.

157
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:26,159
Preceptor Yu said Lord Ling
poisoned His Majesty

158
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,239
and tried to usurp the throne.

159
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,981
He's been thrown into
the Heavenly Prison.

160
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,780
What?

161
00:07:32,561 --> 00:07:35,100
How could Liang Junye
have poisoned the emperor?

162
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:37,000
Someone must have set him up.

163
00:07:37,001 --> 00:07:38,560
The Heavenly Prison
means capital punishment.

164
00:07:38,561 --> 00:07:40,621
Anyone locked up there
won't be getting out alive.

165
00:07:43,001 --> 00:07:46,140
If we wish to save Liang Junye,

166
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,421
we'll need to take care of
Preceptor Yu first.

167
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,061
Chuxia.

168
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:53,440
This is a serious matter.

169
00:07:53,441 --> 00:07:54,741
We must think it through.

170
00:07:55,201 --> 00:07:57,340
Lord Ling should be safe
for the time being.

171
00:07:57,521 --> 00:07:59,020
We mustn't act rashly.

172
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,460
Don't worry, Yue.

173
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,621
I know what I'm doing.

174
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,100
Seems like I'm about to find out

175
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,821
