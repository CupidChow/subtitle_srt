(Adapted from Xiao A'man's novel)

("After the Ugly Concubine Divorced,
She is Wooed By Big Shots of the Capital.")

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,000
=Episode 14=

4
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,639
What is he doing here?

5
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,639
Did he also come to lend support

6
00:00:50,019 --> 00:00:51,200
to Miss Chuxia?

7
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:54,578
I heard First Young Lady Ling
is quite close

8
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:55,698
with this cousin of hers.

9
00:00:55,699 --> 00:00:58,160
Nonsense! Who cares about cousins?

10
00:00:58,579 --> 00:00:59,578
Just recently,

11
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,480
he and Uncle ganged up to trick me.

12
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,779
I'm going to teach him a lesson.

13
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:04,600
Your Highness.

14
00:01:04,779 --> 00:01:05,840
You must not do that.

15
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,439
Think about it.

16
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,899
If you're able to win
Mr. Baili's approval,

17
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,840
wouldn't that score you
more points with Miss Ling?

18
00:01:13,499 --> 00:01:14,880
You mean to say

19
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,840
that I should aim to please him?

20
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,159
That's right.

21
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,600
You're so smart, Luoluo.
I'll do just that.

22
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,799
How come Chuxia isn't here yet?

23
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,840
Relax, Your Highness.

24
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,258
Since Miss Ling's cousin Mr. Baili

25
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:36,439
is already here,

26
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:39,519
I reckon the lady is on her way.

27
00:01:41,499 --> 00:01:42,960
The Lantern Festival is most opportune.

28
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,840
I will use this chance

29
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:48,519
to express my feelings to Chuxia.

30
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,719
Dear...

31
00:01:52,499 --> 00:01:53,359
cousin.

32
00:01:54,699 --> 00:01:56,519
It's you, Lord Ming.

33
00:01:57,419 --> 00:01:59,480
Your Highness is no longer
attached to Chuxia.

34
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:02,359
It's not good to address me
as "cousin."

35
00:02:02,419 --> 00:02:03,359
Mr. Baili.

36
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,919
Are you here to bet on Chuxia, too?

37
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,399
Bet?

38
00:02:09,499 --> 00:02:11,000
My bet is on Yu Luoluo winning.

39
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:12,760
And also Ling Chuxia!

40
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,299
No one bets on two persons.

41
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,699
You can only choose one.

42
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,119
Now, now. What do you guys know?

43
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,000
A bunch of idiots.

44
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:22,040
Princess Ziyuan.

45
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,399
Yue is here, too.

46
00:02:24,779 --> 00:02:26,919
I thought you didn't like crowds.

47
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,919
I guess it's because
a certain someone is here.

48
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:38,359
Chuxia,

49
00:02:38,779 --> 00:02:41,560
Princess Ziyuan worried
I might be bored at home.

50
00:02:42,219 --> 00:02:43,480
Don't think too much.

51
00:02:43,499 --> 00:02:44,818
Sure, sure, I know.

52
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:45,919
I won't tease you.

53
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:50,160
I hope you didn't take it to heart.
I spoke without thinking.

54
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,560
It's okay.

55
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,880
Am I late?

56
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:54,538
The riddles contest
hasn't started, right?

57
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:55,259
You're not late.

58
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,280
You came just at the right time.

59
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,679
Chuxia, are you thirsty?

60
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:08,560
Let me pour you some water.

61
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,058
Some water for you.

62
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:11,720
Here.

63
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,600
It's fine.

64
00:03:14,059 --> 00:03:14,959
Drink...

65
00:03:23,619 --> 00:03:24,720
This tea is quite good.

66
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,239
Thank you, Ziyan.

67
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,560
Hang on, Uncle.

68
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:29,200
I poured it for Chuxia.

69
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,058
You two tricked me
the last time, didn't you?

70
00:03:34,059 --> 00:03:35,959
It wasn't a marriage proposal.

71
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,560
Tricked you, how?

72
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:39,880
Our feelings are mutual.

73
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,679
Can't you tell?

74
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,119
(Liang Junye's acting
has become so convincing.)

75
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,639
You're bluffing.

76
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:49,000
You two are surely pretending.

77
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:56,160
Hey...

78
00:03:56,659 --> 00:03:58,119
There are more female visitors here.

79
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,399
Why don't we find a seat
somewhere else?

80
00:04:00,619 --> 00:04:02,179
I'm not going, Uncle.

81
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:02,419
I...

82
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:02,739
Come on.

83
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,818
I want to sit with Chuxia and Luoluo.

84
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:05,139
Let's go.

85
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,538
Chuxia, Luoluo, save me!

86
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:07,559
Let's go.

87
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,500
(Preceptor Yu)

88
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:12,919
Lantern riddles add cheer
to the Lantern Festival.

89
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,160
This year, the rules
for the riddles contest are simple.

90
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,399
Within the period of half an hour,

91
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,459
the participant with
the most correct answers

92
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,479
will be today's winner.

93
00:04:22,739 --> 00:04:24,680
His Majesty's treasured item,

94
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,800
the Blazing Kirin, will be the prize.

95
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:28,338
Take note that there are some changes

96
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:29,538
to the rules this year.

97
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:31,639
Participants will compete in pairs.

98
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,479
Participants, please come to the stage
to draw lots.

99
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,479
Ling Chuxia!

100
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,839
With me here, you can forget
about winning.

101
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,360
Why aren't you taking part, Princess?

102
00:04:56,419 --> 00:04:58,839
I wasn't planning on
attending the event at all.

103
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,479
I'll just spectate alongside you.

104
00:05:01,659 --> 00:05:02,800
I see.

105
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,860
(One)

106
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:08,839
Uncle.

107
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,839
You don't mind me
choosing first, right? Thanks.

108
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,700
(One)

109
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,940
(Two)

110
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:21,499
(I know this one.)

111
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,738
Ling Chuxia, you were kicked
out of the family.

112
00:05:23,739 --> 00:05:25,360
How dare you show your face in public?

113
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,240
That looked painful.

114
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,800
You bootlicker.

115
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,719
You wish to win
the lantern riddles contest?

116
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:40,858
Don't make me laugh.

117
00:05:40,859 --> 00:05:42,120
I'm going to beat you.

118
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,200
First Young Lady Ling is quite amusing.

119
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,880
She's straightforward and never
bothered by rules and customs.

120
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,039
That's right.

121
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:53,000
She's always been like this,

122
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,360
free and easy by nature,
never complaining.

123
00:05:58,219 --> 00:05:59,279
Unlike me,

124
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:00,880
wallowing in self-pity.

125
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:03,519
Mr. Baili has excellent chess skills
and extraordinary intelligence.

126
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:05,560
You shouldn't be tied down
by your condition.

127
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:08,399
Moreover, First Young Lady Ling
is a skilled physician.

128
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:09,839
She'll surely be able to cure you.

129
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,880
Let's hope so.

130
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:15,320
I wouldn't want to let Chuxia down.

131
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:32,139
Gold.

132
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,240
Answer is correct.

133
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:35,579
Flower.

134
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,599
Answer is incorrect.

135
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,079
A constant rustling sound.

136
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,479
Love and affection are in my heart.

137
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,379
A union on water.

138
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,320
It's hard to hide a smile from others.

139
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:53,560
Guess a kind of bird.

140
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,479
Bird?

141
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,880
Mountain chicken?

142
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:10,880
Wild duck.

143
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:12,800
Quail!

144
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:15,418
What is it?

145
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:17,479
A constant rustling sound.

146
00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:21,560
A constant rustling sound.

147
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,778
Constant...

148
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:25,719
A pair, now and forever.

149
00:07:26,859 --> 00:07:28,120
The answer is mandarin duck.

150
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,959
I know none of the answers.

151
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,519
Luoluo, you're unbelievable.

152
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:47,858
Give me a hint.

153
00:07:47,859 --> 00:07:49,079
Let me get one right.

154
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,440
Eyes.

155
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,338
Eyes.

156
00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:57,920
That riddle has been solved.

157
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,599
I wasn't answering it.

158
00:08:03,179 --> 00:08:04,978
Three-day spring tour.

159
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:05,658
Human.

160
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:06,680
Answer is correct.

161
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,780
