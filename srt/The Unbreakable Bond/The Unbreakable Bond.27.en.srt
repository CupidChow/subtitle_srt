00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,440
=The Unbreakable Bond=
(Adapted from Xiao A'man's novel)

2
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,020
("After the Ugly Concubine Divorced,
She is Wooed By Big Shots of the Capital.")

3
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,100
=Episode 27=

4
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,959
That will depend on how close
the person is to me,

5
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,400
how real or fake they are.

6
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:53,599
It's someone I once relied on.

7
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:57,239
A person I opened my heart to.

8
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,520
Then, have you ever worried
for that person?

9
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,400
Constantly reminded of them?

10
00:01:07,419 --> 00:01:08,240
Chuxia,

11
00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:09,799
you should ask yourself.

12
00:01:10,139 --> 00:01:11,760
Who exactly is this person?

13
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,120
Who?

14
00:01:21,779 --> 00:01:23,439
Who is he, really?

15
00:01:36,419 --> 00:01:37,680
I can't write anymore letters.

16
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,040
She's not replying at all.

17
00:01:39,779 --> 00:01:41,400
This stupid idea Liefeng gave me.

18
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,359
Writing letters is no use at all.

19
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,999
I have to be more proactive.

20
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,439
I'll go and see what Chuxia is up to.

21
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,480
It's been a few days since we met.

22
00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:52,240
She's probably cooled down.

23
00:02:03,419 --> 00:02:04,439
Your Highness.

24
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,840
Do you know how to sweep?

25
00:02:07,059 --> 00:02:08,218
Look at your work.

26
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:09,639
Here, and here.

27
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:12,919
Do it properly.

28
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,200
I looked into Liang Junye's background.

29
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:19,200
He was indeed present
during the Yuyao Pass incident.

30
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,959
General Baili thought highly of him.

31
00:02:21,059 --> 00:02:21,938
On numerous occasions,

32
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:23,579
he wanted to marry you
to him as princess.

33
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,818
After the Yuyao Pass incident,

34
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:26,000
Lord Ling's father,

35
00:02:26,059 --> 00:02:28,119
Lord Hong, who was
the former Crown Prince,

36
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:29,160
was deposed.

37
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,320
He died in his mansion
from an unknown cause.

38
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:33,579
Following that, Lord Ling
was sent to Shuhuang

39
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,919
and was held hostage for eight years.

40
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,480
But the emperor kept the matter
under wraps.

41
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,040
Very few people knew of his ordeal.

42
00:02:40,499 --> 00:02:41,640
After returning to the capital,

43
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,139
Lord Ling frequently met up
with Preceptor Yu. They were close.

44
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,658
I was carrying out missions
outside the city,

45
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:46,720
so I never saw him.

46
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,658
But I heard this from

47
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:50,160
the Preceptor's loyal minister.

48
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:51,338
Preceptor Yu once said,

49
00:02:51,339 --> 00:02:52,399
if not for Lord Ling,

50
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,679
Yuyao Pass wouldn't have been breached.

51
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,239
(Yuyao Pass was breached)

52
00:02:57,819 --> 00:02:59,639
(because of Liang Junye?)

53
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,480
Chuxia, are you still mad at me?

54
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,040
Liang Junye.

55
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,239
Do you still remember

56
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,440
the wish you made?

57
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,519
What wish?

58
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,480
The one you made under
the wish-granting tree.

59
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:23,200
"May your wish come true."

60
00:03:24,339 --> 00:03:25,480
How did you know?

61
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,119
Does the wish

62
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:32,760
still count?

63
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:33,839
Of course.

64
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:37,839
But, Chuxia,

65
00:03:38,059 --> 00:03:40,320
can we release
this Kongming lantern first?

66
00:03:40,499 --> 00:03:41,799
I carefully prepared it.

67
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:45,959
What do you want to wish for this time?

68
00:03:47,499 --> 00:03:48,200
Take a look.

69
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:56,079
You write one, too, Chuxia.

70
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:09,280
It's okay.

71
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,000
We can release another one.

72
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:12,679
Make sure you write a wish then.

73
00:04:13,059 --> 00:04:14,160
Liang Junye,

74
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,360
I have a question for you.

75
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,360
Can you answer me honestly?

76
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:23,279
Of course.

77
00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:24,639
What is the question?

78
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:26,760
About Yuyao Pass,

79
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,320
about Shuhuang.

80
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,760
Ziyan is going to send the army
to take down Shuhuang.

81
00:04:34,299 --> 00:04:35,479
You should forget

82
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:36,819
the past and move on.

83
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,920
You stayed in Shuhuang for eight years.

84
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,200
Did you have anything to do

85
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,200
with the Yuyao Pass incident?

86
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,399
Chuxia.

87
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:52,259
Can you not ask about that?

88
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,440
I'm asking you.

89
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,120
Did you have anything to do

90
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,800
with Yuyao Pass getting breached?

91
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,120
No matter what you say,

92
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:12,920
I will believe you.

93
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,360
Yes.

94
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,159
I gave the order to open the gates.

95
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,599
When you stumbled into my room that day,

96
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:30,560
was that also your brilliant plan?

97
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,360
Yes.

98
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,399
I purpose ran toward your room.

99
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:42,560
Do you have the Shuhuang mark
on your body?

100
00:05:47,739 --> 00:05:48,479
I do.

101
00:05:55,299 --> 00:05:56,320
Liang Junye.

102
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,560
You hold too many secrets on you.

103
00:06:03,219 --> 00:06:04,839
I have no idea

104
00:06:06,859 --> 00:06:08,240
which one

105
00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:10,760
is the real you.

106
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,220
(Prime Minister's Residence)

107
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,279
Chuxia,

108
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:39,839
no matter what,

109
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,440
you're still my daughter.

110
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:45,418
I'm retired and will soon
return to the hometown.

111
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,719
I was going to take Qiuqing along,

112
00:06:48,179 --> 00:06:50,719
but I can't seem to find her.

113
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,098
Perhaps the girl

114
00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:55,360
doesn't want to go back
and live a hard life.

115
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,639
So,

116
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,760
what is it you wish to say?

117
00:06:59,859 --> 00:07:01,000
I get it.

118
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,639
All these years,

119
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,959
I've not treated you well.

120
00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:07,039
You suffered because of that.

121
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:09,800
If you're willing to go with me,

122
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,079
based on my wealth and capabilities,

123
00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:14,560
you and I are fully capable of living

124
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,639
a comfortable life.

125
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,778
When are you leaving?

126
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:27,039
First thing tomorrow morning.

127
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:33,240
Okay,

128
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:35,259
I will go with you.

129
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,079
Really?

130
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,639
I thought you'd refused.

131
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,000
I'll go and pack my things.

132
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,098
My lord, First Young Lady Ling
agreed to go back to the countryside

133
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:51,240
with her father.

134
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,260
(General's Residence)

135
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,240
Yue,

136
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,760
we'll part here.

137
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,599
Chuxia,

138
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:01,360
won't you consider staying?

139
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:03,719
The truth about
the Yuyao Pass incident is out.

140
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:05,899
But it's yet to be announced publicly.

141
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,760
Yue,

142
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,399
I've longed for a quiet life
in the countryside.

143
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,178
It's the right time.

144
00:08:13,179 --> 00:08:15,218
Is staying with me
at the General's Residence

145
00:08:15,219 --> 00:08:15,978
not good?

146
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:17,039
You should know.

147
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,920
I loved rolling in the mud
when I was little,

148
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,039
chasing ducks, catching fish.

149
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:22,760
On such things,

150
00:08:22,859 --> 00:08:24,440
you were always lagging behind me.

151
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,000
You, on the other hand...

152
00:08:31,339 --> 00:08:32,359
Don't worry.

153
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:34,099
I got in touch with an old subordinate

154
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,280
of Grandfather's.

155
00:08:35,579 --> 00:08:36,458
Once autumn comes,

156
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:38,298
I'm planning to return to training

157
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:39,479
and assume military duties.

158
00:08:39,699 --> 00:08:40,599
Right.

159
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,999
Autumn

160
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,680
is just around the corner.

161
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:57,340
(General's Residence)

162
00:08:57,699 --> 00:09:00,160
Just now you said I can go with you.

163
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:01,640
So you agreed.

164
00:09:02,939 --> 00:09:04,599
You said you'd be my weapon, right?

165
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,879
Of course I'm taking you along.

166
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,640
Perhaps Lord Ling

167
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:11,959
had nothing to do
with the Yuyao Pass incident.

168
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,800
Are you really not going to forgive him?

169
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,999
I gave him a chance.

170
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,040
But

171
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,040
he refused to tell me the truth.

172
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,200
I'm leaving the capital now

173
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,520
to go to Yuyao Pass.

174
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,920
I wish to investigate it myself.

175
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,520
I'm going to find out more

176
00:09:39,699 --> 00:09:41,440
