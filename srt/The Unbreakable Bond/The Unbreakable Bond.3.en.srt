00:00:36,984 --> 00:00:38,780
=The Unbreakable Bond=
(Adapted from Xiao A'man's novel)

2
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,960
("After the Ugly Concubine Divorced,
She is Wooed By Big Shots of the Capital.")

3
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,920
=Episode 3=

4
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:55,559
Guard!

5
00:00:57,339 --> 00:00:59,760
Kill all the birds in the capital.

6
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,099
But Your Highness, that's...

7
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,859
Do I have to repeat myself?

8
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:03,658
Do it!

9
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:04,480
Yes, Your Highness.

10
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,799
(Yu Luoluo, Imperial Preceptor's daughter)
I can't stand ugly things like that.

11
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:12,680
In the capital, only Luoluo
is the most beautiful.

12
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,279
Your Highness is too kind.

13
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:15,840
I'm flattered.

14
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:19,760
Luoluo,

15
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:22,240
it's almost noon.

16
00:01:22,699 --> 00:01:23,880
Why don't we...

17
00:01:25,059 --> 00:01:25,960
Who are you?

18
00:01:27,779 --> 00:01:28,719
Liang Ziyan.

19
00:01:30,339 --> 00:01:31,739
Since Your Highness has a guest,

20
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,240
I shall take my leave first.

21
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,159
No...

22
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,639
Luoluo, I...

23
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:49,480
Hey, Ling Chuxia!

24
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:52,999
You're even more detestable
than yesterday.

25
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,400
Even if you kneel and beg me today,

26
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:57,579
I am never marrying you.

27
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,680
Your Highness.

28
00:01:59,339 --> 00:02:00,799
You're not only dumb,

29
00:02:01,059 --> 00:02:02,240
you're also forgetful.

30
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,079
Yesterday, I divorced you.

31
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,639
Hey you, Ling Chuxia...

32
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:13,399
Boxes and containers,
there are 16 in total.

33
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,519
Also the land deed
for the street in South City.

34
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,179
I'd like Your Highness

35
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,440
to return them to me
without missing a single one.

36
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,160
Wretched woman.

37
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,119
You're asking me for money?

38
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:27,639
I'm telling you right now.

39
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:29,720
You won't be getting even a cent today.

40
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:31,778
Yesterday, the whole capital saw

41
00:02:31,779 --> 00:02:33,320
how you were kicked out
of the king's mansion.

42
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,760
So these wedding dowries

43
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,280
naturally will be retained.

44
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,938
Your Highness' skin

45
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:40,760
is as thick as can be.

46
00:02:41,059 --> 00:02:42,959
Well, since Your Highness
is so shameless,

47
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:44,799
then I'd let the people know.

48
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,919
Lord Ming's lower body was impaired,

49
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:51,519
so he needed a stand-in
on the night of consummation.

50
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:55,160
Wretched woman,

51
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,919
what nonsense are you spouting?

52
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,119
Stand-in?

53
00:02:58,659 --> 00:02:59,498
What stand-in?

54
00:02:59,499 --> 00:03:00,799
I never saw anyone.

55
00:03:02,059 --> 00:03:03,160
Even if he did exist,

56
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,040
he's probably no longer of this world.

57
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,040
You got rid of him?

58
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,760
Lord Ling is here.

59
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:13,000
Ziyan.

60
00:03:13,499 --> 00:03:15,299
How come it's always so lively
at your mansion?

61
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,320
Uncle.

62
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,119
What brings you here again?

63
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,679
His Majesty heard about the mishap
on your wedding day

64
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,480
and specifically asked me
to check on things.

65
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,200
I had no choice but to come.

66
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:28,299
Ling Chuxia,

67
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,440
you can forget about
getting the dowry back.

68
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:34,119
(If I can't find a witness,)

69
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,639
(I'll have to think of another way
to control Liang Ziyan.)

70
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:38,880
After taking a good look today,

71
00:03:39,059 --> 00:03:40,778
Ziyan certainly has the best luck.

72
00:03:40,779 --> 00:03:41,899
Unlike me,

73
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,760
I'm still alone and single.

74
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:48,519
Listen, Uncle.

75
00:03:49,619 --> 00:03:51,459
I have some matters to handle today.

76
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,600
Next time, I'll find a day
to personally visit you.

77
00:03:54,779 --> 00:03:56,818
I know you love good wines,

78
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,839
so I specially got a jar
of quality wine as a gift.

79
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:00,699
Shouldn't you at least
invite me for a drink

80
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,679
before chasing me off?

81
00:04:03,499 --> 00:04:05,040
Why are you still here, Ling Chuxia?

82
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:11,519
Though I heard some rumors
about last night

83
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:13,440
while on the way here.

84
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,440
Something about servants, collusion,

85
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,000
and an eunuch?

86
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:21,279
They are saying
you had tricked Miss Ling.

87
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:25,920
Guards!

88
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,139
Your Highness.

89
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,200
Didn't I tell you
to kill him off when he left?

90
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:32,519
Why are there rumors?

91
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:33,538
Go and find out, now!

92
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:34,320
Yes, Your Highness.

93
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,959
(Is Lord Ling offering
to be my witness)

94
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:40,399
(and pressure Liang Ziyan?)

95
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:42,360
(With such a set-up,)

96
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,519
(I hope she knows
I'm trying to help her.)

97
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:47,240
Your Highness.

98
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,639
Ling Chuxia, you set me up!

99
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:53,959
That's right.

100
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,039
If you wish to keep this quiet,

101
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,320
then do as I say

102
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:00,360
and return my things.

103
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,159
Guard.

104
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:05,760
Send the dowry and land deed

105
00:05:05,859 --> 00:05:07,240
back to the Prime Minister's Residence.

106
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,959
Ling Chuxia, don't let me
see you again.

107
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,800
I don't want to vomit in your face.

108
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,560
Uncle, you've had a drink.

109
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,839
I shall not keep you any longer.

110
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,360
Yes, I enjoyed the tea.

111
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,000
I won't take anymore of your time.

112
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:40,719
Miss Ling.

113
00:05:46,219 --> 00:05:48,440
How come you didn't say goodbye
before leaving?

114
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:52,680
Your Highness always seems to show up
at the right moment.

115
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,039
I helped you once more.

116
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,039
Aren't you going to thank me?

117
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,079
I doubt it was a coincidence

118
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,920
Your Highness came here, right?

119
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,279
Didn't you ask me

120
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:11,719
to extend help when you're in trouble?

121
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,719
Now that you are in trouble,

122
00:06:13,859 --> 00:06:15,760
it's only right for me
to step up and help.

123
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,619
Is Your Highness that anxious

124
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,519
to repay me for curing your poison?

125
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,279
In my opinion,

126
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:25,959
this small matter

127
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,200
is hardly worth anything
compared to your life.

128
00:06:32,299 --> 00:06:34,000
Pretty greedy, aren't you?

129
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,939
(Prime Minister's Residence)
Miss. Gold, silver, deeds, paintings, jewelry

130
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,800
have all been changed to cash.

131
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:43,920
On your knees!

132
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:44,920
Chuxia.

133
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,800
You need to apologize to your father.

134
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,200
How could you
publicly divorce Lord Ming?

135
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:52,059
How do you expect your father
to face other people?

136
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,000
Retainer, execute Family Law.

137
00:06:54,219 --> 00:06:56,479
I'm going to beat this
ungrateful daughter to death today.

138
00:06:58,339 --> 00:06:59,599
What did I do wrong?

139
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,519
Was it wrong because the trap failed,

140
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,800
or was I wrong

141
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,760
for not handing the Lady of Ming title

142
00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:07,800
to Ling Qiuqing?

143
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,279
Even now

144
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:11,259
you still want to trample
on your little sister.

145
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,079
The marriage between the Ling Family
and Lord Ming

146
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,738
was bequeathed by His Majesty.

147
00:07:14,739 --> 00:07:15,619
Did you think

148
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,000
I was eager to send you off
to embarrass our family?

149
00:07:18,299 --> 00:07:19,019
Yunniang,

150
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,599
don't you know how to do your work?

151
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:22,699
The young lady's face is blackened.

152
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,978
It's not a good look.

153
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:25,379
Hurry up and clean it.

154
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,760
Yes, ma'am. It's my fault.

155
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,240
Get up, Yunniang.

156
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:31,839
This doesn't concern you.

157
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:34,778
You're lucky to be marrying
into the Lord Ming's household.

158
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:36,839
Where on earth did you get the courage

159
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,839
to even think of divorcing His Highness?

160
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,899
You should know that
he is the future emperor

161
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,399
of Great Yue.

162
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,719
Chuxia,

163
00:07:45,739 --> 00:07:47,418
even if you didn't want to marry,

164
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:49,899
you shouldn't have taken it out on Yang.

165
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,039
What?

166
00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:53,079
She dared harm Dongyang?

167
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:54,120
Madam Qu,

168
00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:58,360
you sure know how to fan the flames.

169
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,778
Chuxia, this is for your own good.

170
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:02,959
How could you question
my good intention?

171
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:03,760
Sir.

172
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,159
I will...

173
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:06,978
You!

174
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:08,379
You ungrateful daughter!

175
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,019
To feed without teaching
is the father's fault.

176
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,959
You hit me before finding out the truth.

177
00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:13,959
No wonder the children you raised
are ungrateful.

178
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:15,240
You're rebelling?

179
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,418
You're rebelling!

180
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:18,719
I'm rebelling against the culture
of  patriarchal attitudes,

181
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,920
rebelling against marriage
for the sake of power.

182
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,639
I will be the one to decide my own life.

183
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,279
It's none of your business.

184
