=The Unbreakable Bond=
(Adapted from Xiao A'man's novel)

2
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,020
("After the Ugly Concubine Divorced,
She is Wooed By Big Shots of the Capital.")

3
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,100
=Episode 18=

4
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:46,639
Easy.

5
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:53,879
I kept saying

6
00:00:55,979 --> 00:00:58,559
I'd take Yunniang with me
and live in the countryside.

7
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,080
Without any scheming and plotting.

8
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,120
A life without suffering.

9
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:07,919
Now...

10
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,680
I broke my promise.

11
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:12,760
Chuxia,

12
00:01:13,259 --> 00:01:14,919
Yunniang wouldn't blame you.

13
00:01:15,419 --> 00:01:16,960
So don't blame yourself.

14
00:01:17,139 --> 00:01:19,120
This happened because
of those evil people.

15
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,279
Liang Junye came and saved me in time.

16
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:29,359
But he wasn't able to save Yunniang.

17
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,439
If not for my leg,

18
00:01:34,339 --> 00:01:36,359
I would've protected you.

19
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,040
Yue,

20
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,120
this had nothing to do with you.

21
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,120
It's not your fault.

22
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:46,040
Chuxia,

23
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,079
you should rest.

24
00:01:49,339 --> 00:01:51,079
I'll get De to prepare
the medicine for you.

25
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,179
Once we leave this place,

26
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,659
we won't have to pander to Miss Qiuqing

27
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,279
and the young master anymore.

28
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,919
Miss, it felt so good just now.

29
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,600
Mr. Liang.

30
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,160
Mr. Baili.

31
00:02:31,779 --> 00:02:34,760
I said some harsh things earlier today.

32
00:02:35,339 --> 00:02:36,399
I do apologize.

33
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,600
It's understandable.

34
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:41,919
After all, Chuxia is your own family.

35
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,760
In a few days,

36
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,000
it will be Chuxia's birthday, right?

37
00:02:50,339 --> 00:02:51,040
Yes.

38
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,959
Do you have any plans?

39
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,079
Yunniang.

40
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:08,440
I'm thirsty.

41
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,880
Yunniang?

42
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:44,560
Miss Chuxia.

43
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,498
What are you doing here?

44
00:03:49,499 --> 00:03:50,600
I came to see you.

45
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,459
I heard you calling outside the door,

46
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,399
so I came.

47
00:03:54,499 --> 00:03:55,600
What do you want now?

48
00:03:57,059 --> 00:03:59,399
Pestering the person
you had wanted to assassinate

49
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:00,658
is ridiculous, no?

50
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:02,179
I wish to become your weapon

51
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,320
and protect you.

52
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:05,600
You no longer have a personal maid.

53
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,000
Why not consider taking me?

54
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:08,618
Why should I

55
00:04:08,619 --> 00:04:10,359
take in the person

56
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:12,280
who had wanted to kill me?

57
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,919
I was right about
where Yunniang was, right?

58
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:16,800
If you still don't trust me,

59
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,360
I ask you to give me a chance.

60
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,519
(This person is a killer,)

61
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:22,440
(but he's helped me several times.)

62
00:04:22,859 --> 00:04:24,479
(He seems sincere,)

63
00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:26,599
(but I can't help but think
he's hiding something.)

64
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:28,519
(I'll let him stay for now,)

65
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,599
(find out what his motive is.)

66
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:41,360
You better not regret it.

67
00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:43,259
The General's Residence

68
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,479
need a lot of fixing and upkeep.

69
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,738
You'll have to do the work.

70
00:04:47,739 --> 00:04:48,680
My name is Jiang Li.

71
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,880
I'll leave it to you, then, Jiang Li.

72
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,120
My pleasure.

73
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,320
Chuxia.

74
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,959
Are you really going
to let him stay at the mansion?

75
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,320
Yue.

76
00:05:13,659 --> 00:05:16,778
Isn't it a good thing
to have a free laborer?

77
00:05:16,779 --> 00:05:17,920
But...

78
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,039
Yue,

79
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,200
I have a plan.

80
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:21,760
Let us go and eat.

81
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,039
I just recovered

82
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,279
and I'm famished.

83
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:27,399
Chuxia.

84
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:29,479
I know how close you were
with Yunniang.

85
00:05:30,859 --> 00:05:33,479
If you wish to cry, go ahead and cry.

86
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,360
There's no need to put up a front.

87
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,159
Yue.

88
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,959
During the past few days,

89
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:44,719
I've thought it through.

90
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:48,039
I will live on happily and freely.

91
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,279
I will go to the countryside.

92
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,800
I don't want Yunniang
to worry about me up in heaven.

93
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:04,499
Chuxia, Chuxia!

94
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,479
I'm here to...

95
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,519
Oh, dear cousin.

96
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,098
That Lord Ming,

97
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:13,880
he's worse than an annoying fly.

98
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,259
Young Lady just recovered.

99
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,259
She needs quiet.

100
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,719
Please go back, Your Highness.

101
00:06:23,859 --> 00:06:24,839
Out of my way.

102
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,560
Who are you to stop me?

103
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,978
How come you seem so familiar?

104
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:33,240
I have a common face.

105
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,120
Your Highness is probably mistaken.

106
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,599
Whatever.

107
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:39,039
Ziyan.

108
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,800
Uncle, why are you still here?

109
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,959
Are you here to visit your aunt-in-law?

110
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,178
Who's the aunt-in-law?

111
00:06:50,179 --> 00:06:51,418
I'm here to see Chuxia.

112
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:53,000
Chuxia doesn't want to see you.

113
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:04,120
I'll show you people.

114
00:07:14,659 --> 00:07:15,680
Why are you here?

115
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,960
I'm currently Miss Chuxia's
personal bodyguard.

116
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,640
It's only natural for me
to live in the mansion.

117
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,800
I'm asking, why you're here in my room.

118
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,899
Young Lady said it.

119
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,418
There aren't many rooms
at the residence.

120
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:26,579
I'd have to trouble Your Highness

121
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,839
to share a room with me.

122
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,680
Ling Chuxia, you ungrateful woman.

123
00:07:34,739 --> 00:07:35,579
How could she

124
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,479
ask me to sleep
with a man of unknown origin?

125
00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:43,079
Ling Chuxia.

126
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,760
Are you seriously letting that assassin
stay in the same room as me?

127
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:51,440
Aren't you worried
that it'd put me in danger?

128
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:53,619
Your Highness,

129
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,920
he's now my personal bodyguard.

130
00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:59,200
You can't expect him to sleep
in the same room as me

131
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,079
like how Yunniang did.

132
00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:03,360
You're doing this on purpose.

133
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,738
I saved you from
the Prime Minister's Residence.

134
00:08:05,739 --> 00:08:06,920
And this is how you treat me.

135
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,120
Your Highness,

136
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,839
you should keep your temper in check.

137
00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:13,178
Don't forget,

138
00:08:13,179 --> 00:08:15,440
your injuries haven't fully healed.

139
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:17,399
If your old wound flares up,

140
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,079
I won't be able to save you.

141
00:08:20,659 --> 00:08:22,920
It's been a long time
since you two squabbled like this.

142
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:26,800
Is this what they call, "showing
true feelings through adversity"?

143
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:28,579
Shut up, you.

144
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,519
