[man] Hey, can you not drive
like a lunatic today?

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,186
[man 2] You're worried about traffic laws?

4
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,605
You think people like us
care about breaking rules?

5
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,190
[man] Have a problem with our business?

6
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:27,360
[man 2] Come on, man. You know the rules
in the killing industry aren't fair.

7
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,821
We can only take shows
sanctioned by the company.

8
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:33,533
We're not allowed to kill anyone underage?
How lame is that?

9
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,369
[man sighs] You know
what really pisses me off?

10
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:39,998
Cha Min-kyu, chairman of MK Entertainment,
biggest name in the biz,

11
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,708
he made those stupid rules.

12
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:45,003
How are unemployed freelancers like us
supposed to make a living?

13
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,922
[man 2] I hate that word, "unemployed."

14
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,760
[man] Shit, even talking about him
makes me want to kill him.

15
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,428
[scoffs] There's an idea!

16
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:56,056
Should I send
a bloody knife to Cha Min-kyu?

17
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,267
[man 2 scoffs] Why? You have a death wish?

18
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,436
You have no chance against Cha Min-Kyu.

19
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,480
Who do you think you are, Gil Boksoon?

20
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:07,025
Oh, wait, who's that hotshot from MK?
He's got that insect name.

21
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,777
Cricket? Termite? What's his name again?

23
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:17,077
[man] We need to make
all the money we can right now.

24
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,162
It's not like we're getting a pension.

25
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,206
[man 2] Just be grateful
we can make a living.

26
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,666
Lots of the young guys out there
are just sitting around

27
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,543
because all the work dried up.

28
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:32,509
Shit. Young ones out there really have
the wrong mindset in this business.

29
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,261
How can they say
there's no more jobs here?

30
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:39,557
They simply want to avoid hard work
but still make money.

31
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,852
It's the very definition of privilege.

32
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,730
That's why
they call you a boomer, brother.

33
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,982
Don't blame the young ones.
They're not at fault here.

34
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,151
You should blame
the fucked-up social structure.

35
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,737
No, no, the kids
can't blame the social structure.

36
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,572
That's always been fucked.

37
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:58,535
And getting worse.
These kids can't get work.

38
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,412
And me and you
can't even make it with two jobs.

39
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:04,040
Then you're 50,
and they start pushing you out.

40
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,085
It's a fucked-up situation. Hmm.

you are not allowed

Rule number two,

65
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:24,037
you will only take on shows
sanctioned by your company.

But… MK made those rules.

70
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:43,223
Those of us without any jobs can't afford
to play by those rules, and you know that.

71
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,392
Not true.

I'm sure lots of groups
are interested in men of your talent.

73

Any company in this industry that's not MK

74
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,655

is printed on.

Don't get full of yourself, old guy.

00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,016
When you return,
let's change your contract.

181
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,560
And set up an interview for Jae-yi.

182
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,270
Whoa! For real?

183
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,480
So cool! Thank you!

184
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,567
Hey, you better not
go back on that later, okay?

185
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,152
[chuckles] Amazing!

186
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:14,572
-[honks horn]
-Remember… you're a man of your word!

187
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,074
All hail, Cha Min-kyu!

188
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,243
Let's go MK!

189
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,120
Whoo!

190
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,914
[Mantis] Hey!
Didn't I tell you to have faith in me?

191
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,917
You're an MK employee now! [chuckles]

192
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,712
So while I'm gone,
make sure you stay in shape.x

193
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,631
[upbeat electronic music playing]

194
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,215
Wait, what? What do you mean?

195
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,092
MK was doing great. Why would it go under?

196
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,802
Wait, say that again.

197
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:37,720
Min-kyu?

198
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:38,888
Min-kyu is…

199
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,556
He's dead now?

200
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:42,892
Boksoon was the killer?

201
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,604
I'm so jealous.

202
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,482
I had him. I should've taken him out
when I had the chance.

203
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,651
Hey! Where are you?

204
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,694
-You picking me up?
-[Jae-yi] I can't. I'm working.

205
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,238
[Mantis] What?
We haven't hung out in like forever.

206
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,365
MURDER SUSPECT WANTED

207
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,450
I've got some loose ends to tie up.

208
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,536
Talk to you later.

209
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:04,872
[man grunts]

210
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,376
Jeez. I know, work is important.

211
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,211
-Glad you have a gig.
-[man grunting]

212
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:13,464
Keep working by yourself.
And make all that money for yourself.

213
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,675
-[man 2] There he is! Over there!
-Quite a crowd here.

214
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,927
[Jae-yi] Oh, right.
Rumor has it MK tanked,

215
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,388
so other companies
are staking out the airport for you.

216
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,889
[man 2] Mantis, how's it going?

217
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,683
-Mantis?
-We wanna talk about a contract.

218
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,059
-[overlapping chatter]
-Hey.

219
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,770
-[man 3] Let's have lunch.
-Whoa, folks, chill!

220
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:28,979
Take it easy!

221
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,272
Ah.

222
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,691
[Jae-yi] Good luck!

223
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,151
[grunts]

224
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:36,946
[man] Ooh, that's hot.

225
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,280
[sighs]

226
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,157
Okay.

227
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,451
[Jae-yi] Hi, I'm back!

228
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,161
Nice work out there.

229
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,996
That smells awesome.

230
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,499
Mmm, galbi-jjim?

231
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,210
The great Han-ul returns.

232
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,214
I'll bet he really missed Korean food
while he was away.

233
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:59,927
So I thought I'd cook enough
to share with everyone.

234
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:03,055
So, you really think you can recruit him?

235
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:08,018
Even if MK dissolves into thin air,
Han-ul won't join us here.

236
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,979
-[man] I didn't say that.
-[Jae-yi sighs]

237
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:11,814
What's this?

238
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:12,732
EVICTION NOTICE

239
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,859
Oh, that.

240
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,403
We have to move out of the office
at the end of the month.

241
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,406
Ugh, now I'll have to dust off my blades.

242
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,450
You're in no condition for that.

243
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,953
I'll take on extra shows,
so get me some. Even D-level ones.

244
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,037
Sorry, kid.

245
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,623
Your talent is wasted here.

246
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:33,711
I would've been so screwed
after my company fell apart,

247
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,212
and you took me in.

248
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,673
Ah! You kidding me?

249
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,674
[panting]

250
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,843
The fucking elevator still doesn't work?

251
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,137
What's with the fashion failure?

252
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,180
Is it European?

253
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,806
You like that?

254
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,308
The latest line.

255
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:48,726
You love your boy Mantis now.

256
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,728
-Hi, Mantis! How have you been?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

257
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,355
I know, it's been a while. Wait.
[sniffs] What's that smell?

258
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,274
Oh, a certain someone made some food

259
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,485
because a certain fighting bug was coming.

260
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,695
-[Mantis] Whoa, galbi-jjim?
-It's just galbi-jjim, yeah.

261
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,740
I had a ton… in Europe.
That stuff was everywhere.

262
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,450
-Oh, sure. Yeah.
-Hey, come here.

263
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:05,868
-The gang's waiting.
-[woman] Dude!

264
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:09,038
-Can I leave my stuff here?
-Oh, for sure you can. It's a pleasure.

265
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,790
Come on!

266
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:12,875
[groans]

267
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,001
Get going.

268
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:16,295
[woman] I'll be right back.

269
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,256
[dance music playing]

270
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,845
[man] Yeah, drink up!

271
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,931
[dance music continues]

272
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,729
Sorry dude, we're booked.

273
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,898
Open up, or I cut off your fingers.

274
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:39,193
He told us to stop letting people in
because he doesn't like crowds.

275
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,028
What asshole said this?

276
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,489
[guard] The Mantis. You want in still?

277
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,449
Whoa, no. All cool.

278
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:48,536
[laughing]

279
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:56,710
[man] So Jae-yi was this close
to being reinstated to MK.

280
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,504
What's she gonna do now?

281
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,677
You seem pissed off about it. Why?

282
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,264
You know, if Jae-yi joined the company,
then we'd be next for recruitment.

283
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,057
Oh, in your mind, we're equals, huh?

284
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,934
-You think we're the same?
-Whoa, chill, bro!

285
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:12,935
Don't "bro" me, bro!

286
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,520
You think he has a drum for a head?

287
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,772
The least you can do is pay him
before you hit him.

288
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,524
Hey.

289
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:24,029
Did all of you really think
you'd be next once Jae-yi joined MK?

290
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,197
Uh-huh.

291
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,950
You all are crazy.
You kidding me right now?

292
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,410
Yo!

293
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,954
This isn't something I owe any of you!

294
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:35,332
-Su-min, why are you keeping quiet?
-[Su-min] What do you mean?

295
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,836
[man] When Mantis was in Europe,
you said we should all start a company.

296
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,880
Start a what now?

297
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:44,383
-Hey, we were just floating an idea.
-Is that so crazy? We have you.

298
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,595
That's right. It's possible
given your amazing reputation.

299
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,514
-Yeah, it could.
-[man] I knew it could!

300
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:51,849
Now hold on a minute. Hold on.

301
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,642
The boomers are getting
absolutely destroyed.

302
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,977
It's a golden opportunity now!

303
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,689
Hey, he's great at fighting people,
but running a company's different.

304
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,524
Stop talking. You're making it worse.

305
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,485
All I'm saying is maybe we want
someone like Jae-yi to run the company.

306
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,863
She has her shit together
and doesn't beat up her employees.

307
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,073
Listen, you punks.
I said I'd look out for Jae-yi.

308
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,742
I never said I'd take care of all of you!

309
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,744
Why would I need taking care of, anyway?

310
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,120
[Mantis] What?

311
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,373
When did I ever ask you
to get me work anywhere?

312
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,294
She's got a point. You can't say
you'll take care of a woman

313
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,962
if she's already taken.

314
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,381
What do you mean by taken?

315
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,342
[tuts] Ugh.

316
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,594
You're seeing someone?!

317
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,220
Holy shit.

318
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:31,722
Good for you, girl.

319
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,849
Whoa, so Jae-yi's dating a guy. Wow.

320
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,684
Well, congrats my friend.

321
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,311
[sighs]

322
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,271
I need a bathroom real quick.

323
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,439
[man] Hey, hey.

324
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,859
-Nice job, dipshit.
-[man 2] What? What did I do?

325
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:46,820
[sighs]

326
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,115
[Mantis] Hey!

327
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,827
You think anyone can start a business?

328
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:54,787
Yeah?

329
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,039
Wanna know why I need to take care of you?

330
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,999
Because you don't have
the chops to survive.

331
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,709
-[Jae-yi] What?
-[man] We certainly don't.

332
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,002
Yeah, no kidding!

333
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,047
You don't think I have the chops, huh?

334
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,256
No.

335
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,802
We're all tied up.
It's even at eight each.

336
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,971
You kept score? That's cute.

337
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,390
But it's nine to seven. That's the truth.

338
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,893
And after that one time,
you know, I won nine in a row.

339
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,191
Do you honestly think
that you got me for real?

340
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,859
Look, you know I don't lie.

341
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:26,944
[grunts]

342
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:28,278
Shit!

343
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,655
[both grunting]

344
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:35,869
[Mantis] Ah!

345
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:37,496
[Jae-yi] Ah!

346
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,125
[both grunting]

347
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,128
[onlookers] Oh!

348
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,588
[man] Come to think of it,

349
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:49,508
I also heard that Jae-yi beat Mantis
back in the day.

350
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,345
Then why would MK bring up
our boy Mantis first if that was the case?

351
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,972

00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,766
Mr. Chairman,
I'd like to ask you for a favor.

530
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:04,771
Do you remember Shin Jae-yi?
She was the top student in my class.

531
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,148
[action music playing]

532
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,235
[Jae-yi grunts]

533
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,905
[Dokgo] You want me to bring in someone

534
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,740
who left on her own?

535
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,659
I'd have done the same
if I was in her shoes.

536
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,245
After all, you chose me,
even though she won.

537
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:21,913
What we wanted

538
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,291
was you.

539
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,293
Who's we?

540
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,419
[Dokgo] Stop!

541
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,504
[students murmuring]

542
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,591
Any thoughts?

543
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,176
It appears the results are in.

544
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,512
[indistinct chatter]

545
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,389
[Min-kyu] Let's go check out the video.

546
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:41,558
[grunting]

547
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:44,102
Hmm, Shin Jae-yi's moves are clean.

548
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:46,980
She more than lives up to her reputation
as a strong performer.

549
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:51,693
See where the practice weapon
in his right hand makes contact?

550
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,945
He connects
with a shallow cut around the pancreas,

551
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,990
but even with a real blade,
it would only be superficial.

552
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:58,033
Should we keep watching?

553
00:26:58,742 --> 00:26:59,909
[grunting]

554
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,995
He knows Shin Jae-yi is right-handed.

555
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:04,873
So he forces her
to block on her right side.

556
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,250
But what if they used real blades?

557
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,129
[Jae-yi grunting]

558
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,714
It's just not going to work out.

559
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,884
The gap between their skills
will become even wider going forward.

560
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,093
And Shin Jae-yi

561
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,971
will never catch up
to the skills of Lee Han-ul.

562
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:24,351
Come.

563
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:27,020
Teach your dual-weapon method
to the boy instead.

564
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,521
He has the skills,

565
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,858
and your fighting style
will be a great fit for him.

566
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,819
[somber music playing]

567
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,752
Unfortunately,
this will be tough on both of you.

568
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:56,424
I can't include Shin Jae-yi
under any circumstances.

569
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,761
[Mantis] Why? What's the reason?

570
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,057
Jae-yi was uncomfortable
seeing you as well.

571
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,017
If she was uncomfortable,

572
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,186
she must've had reasons.

573
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,272
I can tell you why if you want.

574
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:14,609
[tuts]

575
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,529
Nah, I'm gonna pass, thanks.

576
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,414
If you hadn't come to me.

577
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:30,500
I would certainly have sought you out.

578
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,170
When I start the new MK, I'll need
members of the younger generation.

579
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:38,466
And when my time is up…

580
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,845
your time will come.

581
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:42,971
[knives slashing]

582
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,389
[Dokgo] Until then,

583
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,100
don't waste any time on her.

584
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,060
[sighs]

585
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,689
Why on Earth would you go on a date here?

586
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,317
-How did you find this place?
-Your boss told me.

587
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,112
He said you take your gear
whenever you go on a date.

588
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:00,822
I see.

589
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,699
Your boyfriend is so ugly.

590
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,409
Has he treated you wrong?

591
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,202
Want me to kick his ass?

592
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,329
You're fucking dead!

593
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,374
[grunts]

594
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,925
[slashing]

595
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:24,262
[grunts]

596
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,015
[panting]

597
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:29,309
Ah!

598
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,811
Ah!

599
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:33,438
-[Jae-yi] Where?
-Higher.

600
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:35,190
-Where? Right here?
-A little…

601
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:37,275
-Or here?
-Wait, stop. Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

602
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:39,110
[groans]

603
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,821
I guess the old man
still has some game, huh?

604
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,574
They don't say he's an old man
just because he's old.

605
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:45,784
It's his years of experience.

606
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,243
[groans]

607
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,996
-[grunts]
-Oh, okay then.

608
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,041
You said you didn't want
to start a business. What made you change?

609
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,210
The old man plant a seed?

610
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:58,129
Listen to me. I know I'm good at this.

611
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:02,300
And the old man, he could get
a lot more from a deal than me.

612
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:05,136
Isn't that why you left
and started your own company?

613
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,430
Yes, I started a company, which I ruined.

614
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,682
Because you didn't have me
back in the day.

615
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,185
[sighs]

616
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:17,565
As good as you are,
you can't go it alone here.

617
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,986
These guys don't have the brains you have,
but they do have some skills.

618
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,280
[Jae-yi] It's not like it used to be.

619
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,491
It won't be easy finding an investor,
even for you.

620
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,076
[Mantis] Boom!

621
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,624
What do you think? Good?

622
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:36,876
What else does Jae-yi need to hear?

623
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,253
Uh…

624
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:41,297
What?

625
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:44,801
Oh, come on.

626
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:48,888
You just can't keep on
wasting your life in that shitty office.

627
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,390
Get yourself out of there.

628
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,559
I can do it for you

629
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:54,936
if you're too scared to do it.

630
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:56,855
[man] Oh, I see.

631
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,315
I had a hunch this was coming.

632
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,150
In addition to that,

633
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:05,530
it wouldn't be right holding on to you
with how slow it's going here.

634
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,075
I'm sorry about all this.

635
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:12,245
Hey, hey, don't worry about me.

636
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,290
I'm fine.

637
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,752
I'll still visit, okay?

638
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:22,338
Sure.

639
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,218
-Su-min.
-[Su-min] Yeah?

640
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,847
So there's this guy named A,
and someone else who we'll call B.

641
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:34,183
-They're ball buddies. Childhood friends.
-I'm guessing B has no balls, right?

642
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:39,439
And so, B says she has these dates,
but it turns out that that's a lie.

643
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,526
So why would she lie?

644
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:45,987
My theory.

645
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:50,950
B knows that A is into her,
but this information makes B uneasy.

646
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,952
You think it might be… you?

647
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,495
B clearly also likes A.

648
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,373
The answer is clearly
that B has no passion for A.

649
00:31:57,457 --> 00:32:00,168
[curious music playing]

650
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,258
[Mantis] For fuck's sake,
what's taking them so long?

651
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:13,890
[sighs] The great Mantis,
so completely transparent.

652
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,351
[man] Don't go just yet. Please.

653
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,895
-I've still got some fight left in me.
-[Jae-yi] Please, sir.

654
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:21,147
-[man] Jae-yi, just stay for three months.
-Ah, shit.

655
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,525
-[man] That's all I ask.
-[Jae-yi] I can't. [sighs]

656
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,445
[man] Can't you at least stay on with us
until I find someone?

657
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:29,781
Please think about it, Jae-yi, huh?

658
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:34,035
[Mantis] Hey! I can't believe you
pricks are running late.

659
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,745
Wasting time stuffing your face!

660
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:37,413
We already prepped the presentation.

661
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:42,085
Hey, uh, how did you find us
a major sponsor just like that?

662
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:44,504
We play Blood High School all the time,
you know.

663
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,881
Blood… what?

664
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,971
[Benjamin] What do you think
from a professional standpoint?

665
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,597
-[men] Hello.
-[Su-min] Hello.

666
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:57,517
Here's a sequel to Blood High School,
which is about to drop.

667
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,686
Speaking as a professional,
I have to say that

668
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,813
it'd be more realistic
for the characters to just die.

669
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:04,315
But why would any of us play a game
no different from reality?

670
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,068
-True. No one would play it, for sure.
-Exactly.

671
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,069
[laughing]

672
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,904
Wow. Pretty girl.

673
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:13,241
I need a 3D scan of you.
Turn you into a game character.

674
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,784
[chuckles]

675
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:22,250
[man] Last year,
a total of 317,600 people died.

676
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:27,880
This was a 12,340
or 4.2% increase over the past year.

677
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,675
As for our company's hit numbers…
Should I continue?

678
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:31,968
Just get the next slide.

679
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,221
Okay, regarding the ROI--

680
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,807
Aren't these MK's old numbers
from when they were still standing?

681
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,393
Murder-for-hire businesses
are rarely profitable.

682
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:43,646
This is because of personal training
and operating expenses.

683
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:47,358
Enough of this talk of costs.
Not much to be made anyway.

684
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:51,404
Do you think it'd be okay
if I personally watched you work?

685
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:55,283
-What?
-If I saw it in person, it'd help a lot.

686
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,410
You know why I'm interested in this?

687
00:33:57,493 --> 00:34:00,079
I don't think your reasons are important.

688
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:04,584
Exactly. It's not the profits
or numbers that I find interesting.

689
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,631

[gasps]

692
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,970
I knew there was something about her.

693
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,806
Is she your girlfriend, Mantis?

694
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,183
Oh, sorry.

695
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,893
Rude of me to pry in private matters.

696
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:22,894
So…

[tuts]

698
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,856
…shall we move on

-First up, Kim Dong-young.

00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:32,445
-He's a veteran of seven years--
-[Benjamin] Not him.

701
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:35,239
Put Jae-yi's charts up on screen, please.

702
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:42,580
You already ran a company.
You know, I believe I've heard of it.

703
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:46,084
That's right. It was an up-and-coming gang
back when the industry was successful,

704
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,211
but it failed due to the monopoly of MK.

705
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:50,463
[Benjamin] Huh.
Weren't you once an MK intern?

706
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:53,007
[laughs] Ironic.

707
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,218
You were this hotshot
back when you started,

708
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,844
but you moved to an unknown company.

709
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,096
-Why is that?
-[Jae-yi] Hmm.

710
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,932
[Mantis] She didn't just move.
She was the chairwoman.

711
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:04,519
A lot of the indie gangs would not
have picked an employee of her caliber.

712
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:08,022
And the bigger gangs shunned her because
she turned her company into a joke?

713
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,023
Did I get that right?

714
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,316
[tense music playing]

715
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,943
[sighs]

716
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,987
You know what?
I will personally endorse her.

717
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,572
So can we now continue?

718
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,908
Exactly how good is she?

719
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,161
Maybe she should spar with Mantis?

720
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,498
[scoffs]

721
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,042
Ah, sorry about that.

722
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:31,254
But all of this
is the information I wanna know.

723
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:34,715
Jae-yi, if you were to maybe fight against
your boy Mantis, who'd win?

724
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,055
God fucking damn it. We're not
one of your fucking video characters.

725
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,975
Listen, I make video games. I know.

726
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:47,353
Oh, and I'm a killer for hire.

727
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:51,983
And the next time we meet,
I'll make sure I kill you.

728
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,485
Okay!

729
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:56,404
We're out!

730
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:57,738
Huh?

731
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,658
-This motherfucker's completely crazy.
-What's happening?

732
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,996
[Benjamin] Hey, you two can stay.

733
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,666
I'm extremely curious. [chuckles]

734
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:11,419
[Mantis] What are you doing?
I said, "Let's go!"

735
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,546
Don't make your boyfriend wait.

736
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,343
We're sorry.

737
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:22,889
[laughs]

738
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:25,725
Do you have any clue what this opportunity
could've done for us all?

739
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:28,019
He's an annoying prick
who wouldn't treat us like humans.

740
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:29,729
That little punk was disrespectful to us.

741
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:32,190
You kill people for a living.
So their manners aren't awesome?

742
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,482
You're an idiot!

743
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:36,068
You really wanna work
with someone who treats you so poorly?

744
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,486
Uh-huh.

745
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,446
What?

746
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,198
I want to do business with him.

747
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:42,491
-Start a company.
-[scoffs]

748
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,535
Shit, I'll find you work, okay?

749
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:45,661
You know I'm the Mantis.

750
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:48,915
That's back when MK
was getting you gigs and a salary.

751
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:51,417
I'm still the Mantis, MK or solo.

752
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,086
But what about us?

753
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,255
-You stay out if this.
-This is exactly the point.

754
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,965
You're the fucking Mantis, right?!

755
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,383
So what are we?

756
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:02,094
-You want another ass kicking?
-Whoa. Whoa, stop it. Stop it.

757
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:05,014
-And you too. Back off, okay?
-No, it's not okay.

758
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:06,515
Now I'm telling you.

759
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:08,851
This is all because of you.

760
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,019
What?

761
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:12,313
It's so clear that Mantis
got mad at him because of you.

762
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,774
It's right in front of your noses.
Can't you see it?

763
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:17,693
Tell her you like her, if you do,
or start going out with him.

764
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,029
Just stop acting like two stupid kids!

765
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,991
[sighs] You two,
I'm so sick and tired of this all.

766
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:25,868
[sighs]

767
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,746
I'm going back up there.

768
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:31,749
Why should I miss out
because of you two idiots?

769
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,919
Su-min, Bboombye,
what are you guys gonna do?

770
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:36,337
In or out?

771
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:38,839
Good for you. I'm out.

772
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:42,218
-[Su-min] Kim Dong-young, wait!
-[Bboombye] Hey! Hey, Dong-young!

773
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:43,552
[Dong-young] Let go, damn it!

774
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,351
[Jae-yi] Where are you going?

775
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:13,040
He's a psychopath. You know it's true.

776
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,167
You blew it up there.

777
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:17,461
Here you go.

778
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,840
[Jae-yi] Whoa, this is…

779
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,258
Yeah.

780
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,803
The hell you mean, yeah?
You must be an idiot.

781
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:28,347
All the time you spent at MK,
and this is all you saved?

782
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,767
You've wasted a lot of money
all these years.

783
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:34,687
The hotel reservations,
fancy cars, luxury goods.

784
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,772
I sold my car, you know.

785
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,816
And this is what you drive now?

786
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:39,984
Does it even run?

787
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:42,111
How else do you think I got here, Jae-yi?

788
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:45,072
So take that car and join the company
while the offer's still on the table.

789
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,074
Don't do this for me, got it?

790
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,618
[emotional music playing]

791
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,957
Was that all cause of me?

792
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,256
Did you know too?

793
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,886
I guess that Su-min was right.

794
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:09,638
You pretended not to know
because it made you uncomfortable.

795
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:13,351
And it's not you. I did this for myself.

796
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,353
I have a reputation as the Mantis, right?

797
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,646
I can't start working for another guy.

798
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:21,525
I should start my very own company,
like MK, only cooler.

799
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,612
I won't make it awkward for you, okay?

800
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:26,572
So help me out a little.

801
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:31,410
-Why?
-So now you wanna know why?

802
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,163
You are so talented.

803
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:35,998
At some things.

804
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:37,875
[Jae-yi sighs]

805
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:40,461
You're right.
I'm good at some things, I guess.

806
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,174
I won't assist you.

807
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:46,967
We're doing this together, equally.

808
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:48,886
I'm chairman, though.

809
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,513
[groans] Oh.

810
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,348
It's only logical.

811
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,767
How would you book gigs
without my experience?

812
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,727
Let's see you land one show.

813
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:02,108
MK clients would love to hear
that I have a new company.

814
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:07,571
Deal?

815
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:10,658
[sighs]

816
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:13,285
[upbeat music playing]

817
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:16,038
Hey! I worked a lot of channels for these.

818
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:18,541
I'll allocate shows
by complex evaluations of your strengths.

819
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:20,918
Don't fuck this up,
because I will punish you severely.

820
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:22,837
-Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman!
-Who, Mantis?

821
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,381
The departure of Dong-young
has us all a little down,

822
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:26,549
so let's move on now.

823
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,509
-Yes, Ms. Vice-Chairwoman!
-Vice-Chairwoman?

824
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,511
Hooray, extra points
for Managing Director Yang.

825
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:31,929
I love how quickly she's learning.

826
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:34,265
Whoa, wait. You're a managing director?

827
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:36,350
Just one small thing, sir.
Are these our only shows?

828
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,726
You'd think we'd start with more.

829
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,728
Work hard,
then more work will continue flowing.

830
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:42,565
This one's an A, so I will handle it.
This one's for Jae-yi.

831
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:45,484
-And this one's for Miss Yang.
-Wait, the D-level show is mine?

832
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,528
This is a B, so I will take it as well.

833
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,364
As for this C-level one,
let's have Miss Yang take it.

834
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,825
-What should I do?
-A special undertaking just for you.

835
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:55,411
We'll have a company dinner,
so make it yummy.

836
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:58,038
-[Bboombye] What?
-Just find a restaurant. I'm starving.

837
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:58,998
[Su-min] Yes, sir.

838
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:01,834
[Bboombye] Does the company have
a credit card yet, or do you have cash?

839
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:03,961
Let's go, Vice-Chairwoman, Keep up!

840
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,547
Yes, sir. Here I come, Chairman.

841
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:09,216
-[Mantis] What'll we eat?
-[Bboombye] Spicy sausage stew.

842
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,010
[Mantis] Let's have rice noodles instead.

843
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:14,805
-[Mantis] Okay, here we go!
-[Su-min] Whoo!

844
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,140
[Jae-yi] Cheers!

845
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:18,017
[dance music playing]

846
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,769
-[Su-min] Ah!
-[Bboombye yells]

847
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,984
[cheering]

848
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:41,165
Chairman, tell me,
what are we calling our company?

849
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:43,542
The name? What's the name?

850
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:48,214
MANTIS COMPANY

851
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:01,810
Let's do it.

852
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,357
Oh!

853
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,193
[grunts]

854
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,447
[man choking]

855
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,595
[video game fighting noises]

856
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:41,016
[Mantis] Whoa,
what's with that lowball offer?

857
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,227
How are we supposed
to make a living with that shit?

858
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:46,814
[Dokgo] I have no choice
if I'm going to bring MK back.

859
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,357
You think I have it easy?

860
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,652
Even when we get good shows on the books,

861
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:55,030
we just don't have the superior talent
like you that we can rely on.

862
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,782
Honorable Chairman,

863
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,995
what if you were to outsource
a few gigs to our company?

864
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:03,497
If MK doesn't want to take those on, okay?

865
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,082
Even better if they're A shows.

866
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:07,710
Looks like your chairman position
has turned you into an adult.

867
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,587
The mighty Mantis is actually begging.

868
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,047
Let's get real.
Are you helping us out or not?

869
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:14,091
On one condition.

870
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,223
Of course there's a catch here.

871
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,560
[Dokgo] Ever since Min-kyu passed away,

872
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:27,146
the number of unemployed workers
has doubled.

873
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:31,942
In other words, the era of
playing by the rules is utterly over.

874
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:37,948
This is why I want to set things straight
before more of the year goes by.

875
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:41,660
Now, if the very talented Mantis
comes on board with us,

876
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:43,203
then I know things would go smoothly.

877
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:47,082
You mean you're gonna clamp down
on other organizations like the old days?

878
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,878
Yeah, that's why people
are so desperate to join you.

879
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,004
It all makes sense now.

880
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:55,090
Why did you bother leaving
and causing yourself all that trouble?

881
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:56,759
Huh?

882
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:58,719
[intense music playing]

883
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:04,475
Huh?

884
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,186
Move aside.

885
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:08,312
I got this.

886
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:27,414
[music fades]

887
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:32,836
Why would you call off a show like that
right out of the blue?

888
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,422
We already had a scenario all ready to go.

889
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:36,840
Come on. Don't be like that.

890
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,926
You're holding a big grudge
against the target.

891
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,886
We can ensure
their death is extra painful.

892
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:42,262
Leave it up to the--

893
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:44,390
Hello?

894
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:45,349
Damn.

895
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:47,851
[Mantis] Again?

896
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:51,563
Ugh, for fuck's sake. C-level or not,
that was our first show in a while.

897
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:52,981
Ugh.

898
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:55,734
Oh, at least
every now and then you're out there.

899
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:58,987
Look at my killer hands covered in eczema.
That look right?

900
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:00,989
No.

901
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,909
Please say something to Mantis today.

902
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:06,370
Chairman is how he should be
referred to on company grounds.

903
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:07,788
Who cares? This is between us.

904
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,998
Are you saying Mantis isn't one of us?

905
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:11,625
You're the one who calls him boss.

906
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,920
And besides,
you also have a ton of complaints.

907
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:17,131
We're short on work,
and our beloved chairman

908
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,425
has been taking on
the few shows we manage to land.

909
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:21,719
-What about me?
-[Su-min] What about you?

910
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,721
So Han-ul is best suited for those.

911
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,681
If it bothers you,
maybe book shows yourself.

912
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:27,433
Hey, it's not that easy.

913
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:29,518
Not when Mantis
does practically everything.

914
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:32,312
-At least Han-ul takes care of yo--
-Sh!

915
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,526
Man, if I knew things
would turn out like this,

916
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:38,944
I would've gone with Dong-young.

917
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:40,612
[Su-min] Hey, Bboombye!

918
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:44,408
[door opens]

919
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:46,910
Which of you pricks
left the recycling all over the hallway?

920
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:48,704
Welcome back, sir.

921
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:49,621
It was him.

922
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:51,582
Did you come here straight from a show?

923
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:54,543
I had another one on the way.
This one's for you, Jae-yi.

924
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:58,630
I only got it because someone botched it.
It needs to happen today.

925
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:00,132
It has to be now?

926
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:01,925
It's not difficult. You can do it.

927
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:07,181
Hey, Bboombye. Did you work on
that scenario I told you to draft up?

928
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,515
Either of you guys want this?

929
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:09,767
-No?!
-You kidding?

930
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,102
What the fuck is going on?

931
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,521
I saved that one just for you.

932
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:15,939
Huh?

933
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:17,649
Chairman, I'm…

934
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:20,319
I need a minute with you.

935
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:24,865
We can't keep this up.

936
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:28,285
If we're going to run a company,
then we must give everyone a chance.

937
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:32,498
-So the punks have been complaining?
-Oh, come on, it's not like that.

938
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:35,918
You're the chairman here.

939
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,295
And they all depend on you.

940
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:42,925
[Mantis] Yeah, I know.

941
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,887
But they all earn a salary,
and they're not starving.

942
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,931
Is there any other boss better than me?

943
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:51,767
I hustle, trying to make the best deals,

944
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,894
and then split the money
with each one of you.

945
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:57,314
Then quit hustling
and offer some work to your workers.

946
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:59,358
We can't screw up even once.

947
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:02,027
We're just getting off the ground.
It could ruin everything.

948
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:06,615
Huh? Why start a company
if you don't trust anyone?

949
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:08,325
You could've booked work solo.

950
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:14,790
The only reason you are who you are is
because the MK leaders had faith in you.

951
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,960
I'm not like those guys, okay?

952
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:25,384
-How about me?
-[scoffs]

953
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:27,719
What about you?

954
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:31,682
Oh, please. You too? It's tiring as it is.

955
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:34,226
I take care of you
and get you your fair share.

956
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:37,145
[tuts]

957
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,149
You said
you wouldn't make things awkward, right?

958
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,194
The way you blatantly favor me
makes it hard,

959
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,572
especially when you do it
in front of others.

960
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:52,327
I get it.

961
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:54,830
I'll no longer be looking out for you.

962
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:55,914
Better?

963
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:58,041
You never trusted me with an A-level show.

964
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:00,752
You're so full of it.

965
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:04,172
You see everyone, including myself,
as completely beneath you.

966
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:07,759
Okay.

967
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,388
You want me to make sure
you book my A-level shows, right?

968
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:14,933
[Jae-yi] You still don't get it.

969
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,227
You pretend
you're looking out for everyone,

970
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:20,147
when really, you despise them.
It's disgusting!

971
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:25,235
Ah, shit.

972
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:26,862
[sighs]

973
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,490
So you think I'm disgusting?

974
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:33,535
Yeah?

975
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:39,917
Yo!

976
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:44,546
If it wasn't for me, you would've been
completely screwed. You know that?

977
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:47,466
Isn't that why you ran out
on Benjamin's opportunity,

978
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:49,051
and you joined up with a prick like me?

979
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,721
What?! Am I wrong here?

980
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:54,473
If you hate me
looking down on you so much,

981
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:56,725
do better than me
so that you can be the boss.

982
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:59,186
What? You want to fight me now?

983
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:00,103
Huh?

984
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:02,105
[pensive music playing]

985
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:04,775
[sighs] So you're always right.

986
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:08,612
You're a hell of a boss, Mantis.

987
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:16,536
[water running]

988
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:19,706
[emotional music playing]

989
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:33,804
[Dokgo] How's it going with Jae-yi?

990
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:36,306
No problems between you?

991
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,308
[mysterious music playing]

992
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:41,561
You know, you keep talking
as if you have something to share.

993
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,105
[phone vibrating]

994
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:46,066
Oh, well, timing's perfect.
Here's the partner.

995
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:50,862
Hello, Vice-Chairwoman. What is it?

996
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:55,450
It's all done. I'll head straight home
without going to the office.

997
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:00,789
Oh, sounds good.

998
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:03,500
Hope you return home safely. So tomorrow--

999
00:50:05,627 --> 00:50:06,920
Wait, um, hello?

1000
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:08,797
[Dokgo] You still wanna hear it?

1001
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,675
The reason I said
I'm not working with her.

1002
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:15,554
Ugh, enough.
Stop with the bullshit and just say it.

1003
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:17,639
[suspenseful music playing]

1004
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:23,311
As for Min-kyu and me,
wonder why it turned out that way?

1005
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:28,358
You said the issue was personal.

1006
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,500
I've got company.

1007
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:57,512
[Dokgo] I was angry…

1008
00:50:58,346 --> 00:50:59,389
[glass clinks]

1009
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:02,142
…that someone was

1010
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,811
better than me on the same team.

1011
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:14,279
[Jae-yi] And who are you guys?

1012
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:17,115
Who cares?

1013
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:18,950
I don't want to know.

1014
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:21,995
I really feel like shit today, okay?

1015
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,456
[sighs]

1016
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:26,333
So you better put up a fight.

1017
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:30,295
Fuck all of you.

1018
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:35,759
Having talent is an enormous gift.

1019
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:39,721
However, having middling talent

1020
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:42,140
is considered a curse instead.

1021
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:43,934
Why did you pick Han-ul and not me?

1022
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:46,853
Because if those were real blades
you were using, you would've lost.

1023
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,563
[somber music playing]

1024
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:50,899
You don't understand,
judging by your expression.

1025
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:52,442
It's to be expected.

1026
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,820
Someone once told me that

1027
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:57,447
you'd never catch up to Lee Han-ul.

1028
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:58,740
And I believe it.

1029
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:02,536
And Shin Jae-yi will not catch up
to Lee Han-ul. He's better.

1030
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:06,873
"Never," you say?

1031
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:08,542
[Dokgo] Never.

1032
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,672
Then let me fight him again.

1033
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:19,136
Let me fight him… with a proper blade.

1034
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:22,389
[Dokgo] Do you have any idea
what that would mean?

1035
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:23,515
[Jae-yi] I do.

1036
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:27,185
Would I have spoken up
if I didn't get the meaning?

1037
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:29,771
[Dokgo] I don't dislike kids like you,

1038
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:31,982
which is why I'm considering something.

1039
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:34,276
If you'll allow me to go up against him?

1040
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:35,193
[Dokgo] No.

1041
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,407
No.

1042
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:44,286
If I'm setting you free or not.

1043
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:45,370
[gasps]

1044
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:52,711
Wait, you're releasing me?

1045
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,173
Because I said I would fight Han-ul?

1046
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,008
You pose an extreme risk.

1047
00:52:58,091 --> 00:53:01,011
The company needs to protect
its greater assets.

1048
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:06,016
You kids always cause incidents.

1049
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,480
The chairman said that, right?

1050
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:15,442
He's the one who said, "Never."

1051
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:18,737
And you accepted it

1052
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:21,907
because you're an idiot.

1053
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:26,661
This is precisely what I'm talking about.
I know you.

1054
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:28,455
[knife clangs]

1055
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:29,372
[grunts]

1056
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:31,583
[intense music playing]

1057
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:33,251
[man yells]

1058
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:38,298
[all grunting]

1059
00:53:57,067 --> 00:54:00,028
[Mantis] Jae-yi actually said
she wanted to fight with a real blade?

1060
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,951
We have much in common, she and I.

1061
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:09,996
Particularly,

1062
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:12,874
the way she will do anything to win.

1063
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,460
Stop, right now.

1064
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:18,838
This won't end well for you.

1065
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:20,257
[breathes shakily]

1066
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:23,134
Go to hell.

1067
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:25,804
[yells]

1068
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:34,896
[all grunting]

1069
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,738
[screaming]

1070
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:48,493
I knew she thought
that I was her competition.

1071
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:51,538
But that doesn't mean
she wants to kill me.

1072
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,417
I didn't wanna kill Cha Min-kyu either.

1073
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:57,585
[somber music continues]

1074
00:54:57,669 --> 00:55:00,588
If this is what you had to say,
you should've told me earlier.

1075
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:07,429
I had no way of knowing
that both of you would remain so close.

1076
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,765
Once you leave the company…

1077
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:14,436
stay away from Han-ul.

1078
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:18,106
Having an unstoppable force by your side…

1079
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:23,528
it wouldn't be fair to you.

1080
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:37,667
In the end, it was impossible.

1081
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:42,088
I was unable to distance myself
from Cha Min-kyu.

1082
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:45,717
I blamed him,

1083
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:48,887
but I also looked up to him.

1084
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:52,932
[somber music continues]

1085
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:55,810
[Jae-yi grunting]

1086
00:55:58,730 --> 00:55:59,606

00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:29,177
[muffled high-pitched ringing]

1091
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:36,476
[muffled scream]

1092
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:40,855
[man grunts]

1093
00:56:41,648 --> 00:56:43,650
[Dong-young] Wait, wait, wait! Jae-yi!

1094
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:51,991
Hey, Jae-yi. How are you doing?
It's me, Dong-young. Hi!

1095
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:54,285
[knife slashes]

1096
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:56,913
[gasping]

1097
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,754
[Mantis] It wasn't Jae-yi
who stayed by my side.

1098
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:07,715
I was the one who stayed by her side.

1099
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:13,638
If you insist on keeping
that woman by your side,

1100
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:15,974
make sure you let her know very clearly…

1101
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,228
the meaning of the word "never."

1102
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:23,815
If you're done playing, show yourself now!

1103
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:28,486
[Dong-young gasping]

1104
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:35,618
I told you, I'd do anything
to satisfy my curiosity, didn't I?

1105
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,622
Is Mantis really better than you are?

1106
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,419
Why are you still employed by him?

1107
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:47,380
With your skills?

1108
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:52,010
[music fades]

1109
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:54,345
-[Su-min] Has Jae-yi been in touch?
-[Bboombye] Uh-uh.

1110
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:55,597
[door closes]

1111
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:57,891
-Hey.
-Hey, girl.

1112
00:57:57,974 --> 00:57:59,267
Where have you been?

1113
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:08,234
[Bboombye] Ah!

1114
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:14,032
[Mantis] Come eat with us.

1115
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:15,533
I don't feel like eating.

1116
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:17,035
[Bboombye] Mmm.

1117
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:20,205
[slurping]

1118
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:21,956
-[Mantis] Hey, you bastard.
-Ah!

1119
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,083
You were drinking yesterday.
I'm sure of it.

1120
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,293
[Bboombye] I was not!

1121
00:58:25,376 --> 00:58:27,378
[Mantis] I know you were.
You should've been working.

1122
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:30,632
I told you I didn't drink. Besides,
it's not like there's any work to do--

1123
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:33,593
Okay, prick. You're talking back now?
Outside. Let's go.

1124
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:36,095
-[Bboombye] Really?
-[Mantis] Time to knock you down a notch.

1125
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,931
Okay, stop. Let him finish eating.

1126
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:45,522
Where have you been all this time?
You didn't check in.

1127
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,316
[Jae-yi] I had work to do.

1128
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:49,943
What kind of work?

1129
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:51,653
Just work.

1130
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:54,822
So tell me, what did you do?

1131
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:57,575
Did you hear me?

1132
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:04,249
I work a lot.
Do I have to report back to you?

1133
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:06,000
-[Mantis] Yeah.
-Why?

1134
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:09,128
You really don't know?

1135
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:12,006
Because you are not in charge.

1136
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:14,300
I'm in charge.

1137
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:15,677
[train rumbling]

1138
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:25,478
So come.

1139
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:27,647
Grab a weapon. Let's go.

1140
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:30,316
-Yo.
-Did you see that?

1141
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,402
[suspenseful music playing]

1142
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:36,614
[door slams]

1143
00:59:39,867 --> 00:59:41,077
[sighs]

1144
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:43,621
Shouldn't we be heading outside as well?

1145
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:45,373
They packed their real blades.

1146
00:59:45,456 --> 00:59:48,167
Mantis said to stand by
and remain here. Just stay cool.

1147
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:51,254
But how do you think Jae-yi will match up
against Han-ul right now?

1148
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:53,423
We know how much she trained
while Mantis goofed off.

1149
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:55,633
Are you worried
or just curious about the outcome?

1150
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:58,219
Okay, whatever. Fuck it. I'm heading out.

1151
00:59:58,303 --> 00:59:59,178
Wait! Hey!

1152
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:00,930
Don't push yourself.

1153
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:03,308
Once this is done,
you've got some answering to do.

1154
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:05,935
You're talking
as if you think you're gonna win.

1155
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,937
[Mantis] I don't think it. I know it.

1156
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:09,230
It's just a fact.

1157
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:12,775
[sighs]

1158
01:00:14,902 --> 01:00:17,280
-[both grunting]
-[suspenseful music continues]

1159
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:32,962
[music stops]

1160
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:43,598
[whispers] What the fuck happened here?

1161
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:45,016
Okay, let's call it!

1162
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:51,147
When did you get so good? Huh?

1163
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:54,108
Okay.

1164
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:56,819
That's… that's enough.
I get it. You're good.

1165
01:00:58,237 --> 01:00:59,238
I'm thinking

1166
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:01,115
you should be in charge now.

1167
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:02,742
What do you say, Chairwoman?

1168
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:04,827
[tender music playing]

1169
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:24,639
[Jae-yi] Join me if you want.

1170
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:35,483
[tender music continues]

1171
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:29,704
[Benjamin] Just like I predicted.

1172
01:02:29,787 --> 01:02:32,457
The movements are completely different
when a professional does it.

1173
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:34,208
[man] She really is unique.

1174
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:38,087
People today all have someone
they really wanna kill.

1175
01:02:39,964 --> 01:02:42,091
Murdering vicariously.

1176
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:50,183
[Bboombye] How have you guys been doing?

1177
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:54,896
Well, so MK outsources to us,
which keeps us busy.

1178
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:55,897
That's crazy.

1179
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:59,066
If MK outsources to you, their employees
only have cleanup duty left.

1180
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:04,781
Hey, you're wasting
your youth with Mantis.

1181
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:07,241
Join us. There's no future with him.
We are the future.

1182
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:08,951
Get this. We found funding,

1183
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:11,704
and our chairwoman
is becoming a huge star.

1184
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:14,040
She's the first-ever chairwoman
in the industry.

1185
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:16,793
Now that Mantis
has totally hit rock bottom.

1186
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:20,671
-I knew you did that.
-Did what?

1187
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:23,549
Expose Mantis and made him hit
rock bottom, setting the stage for Jae-yi.

1188
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:26,260
Girl, are you crazy?
You think I have the power to do that?

1189
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:27,637
What the fuck happened here?

1190
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,263
[Su-min] That video you took that day.

1191
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:31,891
Fucking hell,
everyone in the industry has now seen it.

1192
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:33,643
[Bboombye] It wasn't me.

1193
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:37,063
Then did Jae-yi make you do it?
Did she tell you to upload that video?

1194
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,607
The chairwoman was against it too.

1195
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:42,485
[Su-min sighs]

1196
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:48,282
It's like I said, the packaging
is the difference when you run a business.

1197
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:49,909
PR and marketing.

1198
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:51,994
The rise of an unranked player
who took down Mantis,

1199
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:53,329
a notorious high-ranking player.

1200
01:03:53,412 --> 01:03:54,914
[chuckles] That, and you're a woman.

1201
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:57,166
So I thought of
the perfect nickname for you.

1202
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,544
Hey, did you know
mantises are eaten by lizards?

1203
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:00,920
My new name is Lizard?

1204
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:02,797
Killer, right?

1205
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,383
Lizard is a perfect fit for your image.
It pops. I love it.

1206
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:07,677
[scoffs]

1207
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,096
-No, I prefer my real name.
-We'll go with my name.

1208
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:12,515
Let me be perfectly clear.

1209
01:04:13,307 --> 01:04:15,643
About those standards that MK is using,

1210
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:18,145
do we really need
to follow those rules, huh?

1211
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:20,606
It's totally possible
that they're fading away.

1212
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:23,234
Still, the biggest influence
on this business are their rules.

1213
01:04:23,317 --> 01:04:25,862
If you wanna play with the big boys,
you should toe the line.

1214
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:28,030
Principles are obsolete.

1215
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:29,782
Consider it a traffic light, more or less.

1216
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:33,244
But those traffic lights were set up
by Cha Min-kyu, who's dead and gone.

1217
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:35,997
Ah!

1218
01:04:36,497 --> 01:04:37,957
But Dokgo remains alive.

1219
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,585
Is he really that special?

1220
01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:44,046
So maybe he might get eaten by the Lizard?

1221
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:46,215
[tense music playing]

1222
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:48,467
So what I'm supposed to get here

1223
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:53,931
is it's not the regulations,
but the person using them.

1224
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,141
Am I right?

1225
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:57,393
I just don't like the guy.

1226
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:00,730
He shat on my offer.

1227
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:04,567
So now,

1228
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:07,695
follow my plan, Lizard.
Don't mess this up.

1229
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,573
[chuckles]

1230
01:05:10,656 --> 01:05:13,159
[Mantis] Why waste your time
bringing this over in person?

1231
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:15,494
You could've sent one of your underlings.

1232
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:17,997
You really shouldn't have.

1233
01:05:18,497 --> 01:05:20,875
-You really let yourself go there, Mantis.
-[Mantis sighs]

1234
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:22,376
Thanks anyway.

1235
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:25,004
I'm so pleased
for these shitty jobs you're offering.

1236
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:26,172
Fine with me.

1237
01:05:26,672 --> 01:05:28,007
I didn't say I refuse.

1238
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:30,468
I said, "Thank you," didn't I?

1239
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:31,552
Charming, man.

1240
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:36,432
If you cooperate and do what I ask
at the upcoming assembly session,

1241
01:05:36,515 --> 01:05:38,184
then you'll book all the A-level shows.

1242
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:41,020
The gangs from Beijing are now all at war.

1243
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:46,484
Well, I'm also from MK,
so I'm all for having rules.

1244
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:49,737
But I don't know whether my cooperation
would have any influence.

1245
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:53,950
I saw that video as well.

1246
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:58,788
I've been hearing a lot of chatter
about Jae-yi's company.

1247
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:01,207
Maybe expansion is next for her.

1248
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,626
Does that make you hungry?

1249
01:06:04,251 --> 01:06:06,253
You'll get a stomachache if you overeat.

1250
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:10,299
You still don't want to return
to the company?

1251
01:06:12,426 --> 01:06:14,971
Wow, this guy's hideous, am I right?

1252
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:19,225
[Dokgo] How many shows
are we sending them these days?

1253
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:20,476
[man] We've greatly cut back.

1254
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:22,812
Just one or two a month
so it's not too obvious.

1255
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:24,647
[Dokgo] Cut everything off now.

1256
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:25,940
Yes, sir.

1257
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:31,404
[Su-min] Hey, boss.

1258
01:06:31,904 --> 01:06:35,825
If you're not going to MK because of me,
then you don't need to worry.

1259
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:37,076
It's all cool.

1260
01:06:37,576 --> 01:06:39,996
-Here's a big one for you.
-Seriously?

1261
01:06:40,579 --> 01:06:42,415
So then you'll take the D-level one?
Why would--

1262
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:43,666
No one's forcing you.

1263
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:45,084
No, I'm on it.

1264
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:48,462
You sure you can handle it?
No mistakes, right?

1265
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:49,922
As the new managing director?

1266
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:53,426
I'll prove that the managing director
is ready for the job. Trust me, sir.

1267
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:56,053
-Ah! Shit! My back. Ow!
-[Mantis] Managing Director Yang!

1268
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:57,138
Yeah?

1269
01:06:57,221 --> 01:07:00,599
-Doesn't look like you're managing this.
-This is my show! Why are you here?

1270
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:02,935
How could I stay away?
This is totally fucked!

1271
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:05,646
I just got started, okay?

1272
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:08,190
Young man, please wait until this is done.

1273
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:09,984
I'm not finished with the puny woman yet.

1274
01:07:10,067 --> 01:07:12,737
-One thing, Miss Yang.
-Sh! Let's go!

1275
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:15,489
If you can't wrap this up in one minute,
then you're fired.

are easier than I thought.

1308

An A-level show, I bet,
would be just as easy.

1309

So are you really doing D-level shows,
or were you kidding?

Where are you going?
I'm not done talking to you.

1311

Ah, yes. Mantis. Ah.

-[cleaner] No, sir. That's not necessary.

Long time, no see.

01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:33,836
-They say you started a company.
-[Mantis] Yeah.

1329

And you must be an employee. The only one?

1330
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:39,925
[Mantis] Yeah, well, she's enough.

1331

Yeah. See ya.

That short on work, huh?

1334
01:09:45,806 --> 01:09:48,392

isn't what he used to be.

It's Chairwoman Shin.

1344
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:12,249
I heard you came up
with your own nickname.

-It's Lizard, right?
-Hello, my old friend.

1346

1350
01:10:35,147 --> 01:10:36,607
For a long time now…

1351
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:40,986
I stayed distant,
never returning to this world of ours.

1352
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,446
People were curious.

1353
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:45,658
Why is Dokgo returning?

1354
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:47,284
And why now?

1355
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:51,413
It's true. A lot of people in our industry
asked me to come back.

1356
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:55,751
But it was mostly because of duty.

1357
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:58,754
I have a duty to us all.

1358
01:10:58,837 --> 01:11:01,757
A calling for me to protect this,
our legacy,

1359
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,259
that our former chairman created.

1360
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:05,261
Yes, that leader who drove me out.

1361
01:11:06,387 --> 01:11:08,097
[Jae-yi] When you say legacy,

1362
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:11,684
you're actually talking about the rules.
Is that right?

I know you well, Chairwoman Shin.

01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:29,118
Something you'd like to say?

1367
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:31,412
Only that you seem
to be talking in circles,

1368
01:11:31,495 --> 01:11:33,289
using big words that say nothing.

1369
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:37,084
Do you mind if I sum up the gist
of your talk to everyone here?

1370
01:11:37,167 --> 01:11:38,627
Be my guest.

1371
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:40,796
[footsteps]

1372
01:11:40,879 --> 01:11:43,716
I heard you punks
haven't been following our rules recently.

1373
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:45,592
This is why, from now on,

1374
01:11:45,676 --> 01:11:47,886
MK promises
to return things to the old days.

1375
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:50,139
Those who don't follow the rules
will get an ass-kicking.

1376
01:11:50,222 --> 01:11:51,557
Did that sum it up?

1377
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:56,186
It's true. Thanks to the rules,
we have fewer unemployed.

1378
01:11:56,270 --> 01:12:00,024
However, that resulted in work drying up
for the smaller groups.

1379
01:12:00,524 --> 01:12:04,320
Because of that, their workers
were forced to break the rules to survive.

1380
01:12:04,903 --> 01:12:07,531
Then those companies had to shut down.

1381
01:12:08,032 --> 01:12:11,535
So… are you recommending
we abolish the rules?

1382
01:12:11,618 --> 01:12:13,704
You wish to bring in
a new age of unemployed crews?

1383
01:12:13,787 --> 01:12:16,623
I'm simply saying
that we should reconsider our approach

1384
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:17,875
if the results are bad.

1385
01:12:17,958 --> 01:12:19,251
Does that not make sense?

1386
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:25,841
Is that clear? Should I speak slower?

1387
01:12:25,924 --> 01:12:27,593
[crowd murmuring]

1388
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:29,178
[sighs]

1389
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:34,641
[chuckles]

1390
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:41,231
Why are we all just sitting here,
debating about nothing for two hours?

1391
01:12:41,732 --> 01:12:44,109
Man, this stuff is too hard
for me to understand.

1392
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:46,528
So what do you say
we wrap it up and go home?

1393
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:48,405
Right now.

1394
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:50,449
Listen.

1395
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:54,036
"I will no longer abide by these rules."

1396
01:12:54,119 --> 01:12:55,662
Show of hands.

1397
01:12:55,746 --> 01:12:58,165
[tense music playing]

1398
01:13:05,297 --> 01:13:08,509
"We get rid of the need
for sanctioned and approved shows,

1399
01:13:08,592 --> 01:13:11,053
even if the big companies lose some work."

1400
01:13:11,136 --> 01:13:13,806
"If the job will pay enough,
I'm willing to become an animal

1401
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:15,933
and kill anybody, even kids."

1402
01:13:16,016 --> 01:13:17,434
Show me your support now.

1403
01:13:17,935 --> 01:13:19,937
[crowd murmuring]

1404
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:26,860
-It's settled then. We're done.
-[Jae-yi] Hold on.

1405
01:13:26,944 --> 01:13:28,654
I never said
we shouldn't abide by the rules.

1406
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:31,156
We live by a code.
Those who don't must be disciplined.

1407
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:32,574
What?

1408
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,035
But why is the punishment…

1409
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:39,289
dished out by those at MK only?

1410
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:40,707
[crowd murmurs]

1411
01:13:42,042 --> 01:13:44,086
In last year's Gil Boksoon event,

1412
01:13:44,169 --> 01:13:47,005
five compatriots were eliminated
at the same time.

1413
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:48,340
Then, without our consent,

1414
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:50,843
MK performed
an internal investigation on their own.

1415
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:52,553
And then things got strange.

1416
01:13:52,636 --> 01:13:55,722
The director of MK
and another company head lost their lives.

1417
01:13:55,806 --> 01:13:58,183
And even more suspicious than that…

1418
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:04,398
the original chairman of MK,
who created all those rules,

1419
01:14:04,481 --> 01:14:06,024
wound up dead as well.

1420
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:08,944
[tense music continues]

1421
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,573
Who thinks MK
is still able to judge fairly?

1422
01:14:16,326 --> 01:14:17,953
Then who else should do it?

1423
01:14:19,079 --> 01:14:21,748
After all, punishments are only effective

1424
01:14:21,832 --> 01:14:23,834
when the strongest enforce them.

1425
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:28,255
So let me take a crack at the punishing.

1426
01:14:28,338 --> 01:14:30,757
Are you sure you want to be in charge?

1427
01:14:30,841 --> 01:14:32,009
Yes.

1428
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:39,600
Then, if you don't mind,
will you prove your abilities right here?

1429
01:14:42,186 --> 01:14:43,061
Absolutely.

1430
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:51,069
-[Mantis] Whoa!
-[crowd gasps]

1431
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:52,571
Oh fuck! Chairman!

1432
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:54,740
Chairman!

1433
01:14:56,366 --> 01:14:59,745
Chairman!
What the hell were you thinking? Why?

1434
01:15:00,871 --> 01:15:02,748
Open your eyes, boss.

1435
01:15:04,249 --> 01:15:06,210
This makes me very sad. Mmm.

1436
01:15:06,293 --> 01:15:07,169
[tapping Mantis]

1437
01:15:07,252 --> 01:15:09,046
Your friend saved you embarrassment today.

1438
01:15:09,129 --> 01:15:10,464
[Su-min] Chairman, please.

1439
01:15:10,964 --> 01:15:12,424
Open your eyes, Chairman.

1440
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:14,760
You sure you weren't
spared humiliation instead?

1441
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:16,220
[Su-min yelps]

1442
01:15:16,303 --> 01:15:18,305
[suspenseful music playing]

1443
01:15:20,057 --> 01:15:21,350
[tapping Mantis]

1444
01:15:27,147 --> 01:15:28,398
You can get up now.

1445
01:15:32,277 --> 01:15:33,487
Ow! Ow! Ow!

1446
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:36,406
That hurts! I'm not joking.

1447
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:38,200
You deliberately did that, right?

1448
01:15:39,993 --> 01:15:41,495
[somber music playing]

1449
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:50,587
That will do. Nothing else for now.

1450
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:53,006
She was really out for blood today.

1451
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:54,925
If she keeps it up…

1452
01:15:55,425 --> 01:15:56,677
That's the plan.

1453
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:59,054
[Dokgo] …I won't be able to let it slide.

1454
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:01,807
You know
that Jae-yi doesn't want that at all.

1455
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:04,101
It's just the curiosity
of that immature prick.

1456
01:16:04,184 --> 01:16:05,227
And then what?

1457
01:16:05,852 --> 01:16:07,187
[laughs]

1458
01:16:07,271 --> 01:16:08,438
And that was it?

1459
01:16:09,273 --> 01:16:10,399
[laughs]

1460
01:16:10,482 --> 01:16:12,234
Yes, let's talk soon. Yeah.

1461
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:15,612
I kept my end of the deal,
so give us the A-level shows you promised.

1462
01:16:15,696 --> 01:16:17,489
Did you finish the ones I gave you?

1463
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:18,991
So far, I've done one.

1464
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:22,286
And the other one…
is set to go down by sundown.

1465
01:16:22,369 --> 01:16:25,205
So complete those jobs,
and then we'll continue talking.

1466
01:16:25,289 --> 01:16:26,415
[exhales loudly]

1467
01:16:27,124 --> 01:16:28,667
[man] Was there anything interesting?

1468
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:31,169
Oh yeah. [chuckles]

1469
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:32,546
Come here for a second.

1470
01:16:37,301 --> 01:16:38,927
Uh, what now?

1471
01:16:39,553 --> 01:16:40,929
Ah, sh. [tuts]

1472
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:43,640
It's nothing. You won't die.

1473
01:16:43,724 --> 01:16:45,100
[man] Wait! Wait! Ah!

1474
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:49,730
So wait. We have to go up against MK now?

1475
01:16:51,064 --> 01:16:53,775
Don't you think it's a bit soon?

1476
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:55,527
We're just a new company.

1477
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:58,739
When Benjamin got involved,
I knew the risks increased.

1478
01:16:59,239 --> 01:17:00,824
We must play the role of obedient dog

1479
01:17:00,907 --> 01:17:03,076
until we have amassed
enough strength to defeat MK.

1480
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:04,995
What does that mean?

1481
01:17:05,078 --> 01:17:07,706
I'll settle my score
with Dokgo eventually,

1482
01:17:08,206 --> 01:17:09,458
when I'm ready.

1483
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:14,087
But first,
I'll cut off the hand I grabbed.

1484
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:17,591
Are you saying Mr. Jo will be on the list?

1485
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:21,428
No one will be exempt from my list.

1486
01:17:32,689 --> 01:17:33,607
[sighs]

1487
01:17:39,863 --> 01:17:41,031
[grunts softly]

1488
01:17:54,628 --> 01:17:56,713
[suspenseful music playing]

1489
01:18:01,885 --> 01:18:02,969
I see.

1490
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:06,306
I knew…

1491
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:08,141
I knew this day would come.

1492
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:09,351
Yeah.

1493
01:18:09,976 --> 01:18:12,896
You should've closed shop
once you lost your job and your relevance.

1494
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:14,815
This breaks my heart, you know.

1495
01:18:18,777 --> 01:18:19,653
[man sighs]

1496
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:26,118
[clears throat]

1497
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:31,164
Just make it quick.

1498
01:18:32,457 --> 01:18:33,834
Before I die,

1499
01:18:34,918 --> 01:18:36,753
let me see the amazing Mantis show.

1500
01:18:41,967 --> 01:18:42,801
[Mantis sighs]

1501
01:18:47,097 --> 01:18:49,349
If you wanna see my skills,
you should open your eyes.

1502
01:18:58,859 --> 01:18:59,943
Open that.

1503
01:19:08,326 --> 01:19:10,203
I'll send the head to the company.

1504
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:12,289
But I'll be keeping the torso.

1505
01:19:12,372 --> 01:19:14,624
Are you feeling guilty or showing pity?

1506
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:17,294
Come on. We need to replace his clothes.
Time's running out.

1507
01:19:17,377 --> 01:19:19,463
You're definitely breaking the rules.

1508
01:19:19,963 --> 01:19:21,965
And this will cause
major problems for you.

1509
01:19:22,048 --> 01:19:25,927
You think MK will pay much attention
to a crappy show like this one?

1510
01:19:27,137 --> 01:19:28,597
[laughs]

1511
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:33,685
[laughs] This is fucking nuts.

1512
01:19:36,897 --> 01:19:40,066
We both know
that all human lives are ranked.

1513
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:42,944
What's my place then?

1514
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:45,989
A C ranking?

1515
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:48,700
That's fucking bullshit.

1516
01:19:49,659 --> 01:19:50,744
Just do it.

1517
01:19:51,912 --> 01:19:53,038
What are you even saying?

1518
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:55,415
Kill me. Just do it already.

1519
01:19:57,542 --> 01:19:58,543
What?

1520
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:00,045
So now I'm supposed to bow down

1521
01:20:00,128 --> 01:20:02,506
and thank you for saving
this worthless life?

1522
01:20:03,173 --> 01:20:04,466
[Mantis gulps]

1523
01:20:04,549 --> 01:20:07,427
You seem to feel
that it's someone else ruining your life.

1524
01:20:08,011 --> 01:20:10,013
But you chose to let yourself go.

1525
01:20:14,392 --> 01:20:15,393
[sighs]

1526
01:20:20,106 --> 01:20:22,651
If you really wanna know, you ranked a D.

1527
01:20:22,734 --> 01:20:23,985
Happy now?

1528
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:25,028
You see that?

1529
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:29,574
Besides,
I don't believe you really wanna die.

1530
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:31,827
If so, you'd probably fight me instead.

1531
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:38,208
[man grunts]

1532
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:44,923
Go somewhere no one knows you.

1533
01:20:46,174 --> 01:20:48,385
Where you can remain a ghost forever.

1534
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:56,434
[machine whirring]

1535
01:21:00,146 --> 01:21:01,857
I could've handled it if you wanted.

1536
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:05,318
I know that.

1537
01:21:06,403 --> 01:21:10,949
OLD MAN DOKGO

1538
01:21:15,662 --> 01:21:17,497
Hey, old man.

1539
01:21:17,998 --> 01:21:19,499
So, Chairman, what's up?

1540
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,751
I've wanted to get in touch with you.

1541
01:21:22,252 --> 01:21:24,087
Those jobs were completed.

1542
01:21:29,009 --> 01:21:29,885
Jae-yi did what?

1543
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:36,433
[Dokgo] She sent me a message.

1544
01:21:36,933 --> 01:21:38,476
I'm not following.

1545
01:21:40,812 --> 01:21:42,814
[chuckling]

1546
01:21:48,528 --> 01:21:50,530
[Mantis] You're not actually
gonna take it, are you?

1547
01:21:50,614 --> 01:21:52,741
Since I received this from a junior,

1548
01:21:52,824 --> 01:21:55,035
it's my duty to respond in kind
as a senior.

1549
01:21:55,118 --> 01:21:56,786
Are you kidding?!

1550
01:21:57,412 --> 01:21:59,205
What are you talking about, old man?

1551
01:21:59,789 --> 01:22:01,833
I said if you impede us, I won't go easy.

1552
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:04,961
That prick Benjamin is playing
both of you right now!

1553
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:07,923
I'm not getting played,
just playing along.

1554
01:22:08,006 --> 01:22:10,175
Okay, listen carefully. Listen to me.

1555
01:22:10,258 --> 01:22:13,219
So maybe this can all be settled
peacefully without blood on your hands.

1556
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:15,555
And how would I do that?

1557
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:18,808
If I can get to Shin Jae-yi,

1558
01:22:19,684 --> 01:22:22,145
make her recant and take the blade back,
would that work?

1559
01:22:23,855 --> 01:22:26,524
And how would I possibly
benefit from that?

1560
01:22:29,277 --> 01:22:30,278
You'll get

1561
01:22:31,655 --> 01:22:32,906
the Mantis.

1562
01:22:33,865 --> 01:22:35,575
A homecoming with MK.

1563
01:22:42,749 --> 01:22:45,251
You have one day to get this settled.

What is it?

1578
01:23:51,484 --> 01:23:53,778
Tell everybody about an upcoming funeral.

[indistinct chatter]

1580
01:24:05,415 --> 01:24:07,083
Good evening, Chairwoman Shin.

1581
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:09,669
-I'm glad you came.
-How are you doing, sir?

1582
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:10,962
Go on inside.

1583
01:24:16,676 --> 01:24:18,136
Can I talk to you?

1584
01:24:25,769 --> 01:24:27,312
About Bae-soo.

1585
01:24:29,522 --> 01:24:30,690
I did that.

1586
01:24:33,985 --> 01:24:36,780
He'd been doing unsanctioned shows
after he closed shop.

1587
01:24:44,454 --> 01:24:46,289
So why exactly should I care?

1588
01:24:48,124 --> 01:24:49,000
Wait?

1589
01:24:49,542 --> 01:24:51,044
You saying I'm at fault?

1591
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:57,175
No, it's all on me. [sighs]

1592
01:25:02,847 --> 01:25:04,974
The knife you sent
the old man the other day.

1593
01:25:06,267 --> 01:25:07,936
That was someone else's idea, right?

1594
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:12,482
It's my issue.

1595
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:14,442
[Mantis sighs]

1596
01:25:15,652 --> 01:25:16,736
Take it back.

1597
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:20,698
Why should I?

1598
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:22,992
Because I don't want
to go to your funeral, okay?

1599
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:33,378
Are there any more reasons
why I should listen to you?

1600
01:25:36,923 --> 01:25:38,800
After all, I rank higher.

1601
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:44,722
Did you really hate me
when I ranked higher?

1602
01:25:45,223 --> 01:25:46,599
Is that why…

1603
01:25:49,185 --> 01:25:50,562
why you wanted me dead?

Well, I couldn't stand you.

1608
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:06,536
Or myself.

1609
01:26:10,498 --> 01:26:13,334
Why couldn't I get a chance?
Why was it you all the time?

1610
01:26:15,211 --> 01:26:18,882
And why did you, a fucking prick,
stay by my side like some fucking moron?

1611
01:26:18,965 --> 01:26:20,508
Can you explain that?

1612
01:26:20,592 --> 01:26:21,551
[sighs]

1613
01:26:22,677 --> 01:26:26,389
If you fucking hated that I remained
by your side like a fucking moron, then…

1614
01:26:28,558 --> 01:26:30,185
why didn't you just leave?

1615
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:33,605
That would be running away.

1616
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:38,276
I didn't wanna run from you or anyone.

1617
01:26:38,776 --> 01:26:40,028
[inhales sharply]

1618
01:26:41,738 --> 01:26:44,365
Even when I lost,
I extended my hand to you.

1619
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:46,326
Know that?

1620
01:26:46,409 --> 01:26:49,412
One should only grab hands
from the same height.

1621
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:55,710
We're past convincing
each other with words, right?

[Bae-soo] Oh my.

1627
01:27:18,524 --> 01:27:21,819
Thank you so much…
for attending my funeral.

1628
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:23,071

I'm not getting involved.

It's been a while.

Ah, this is unexpected.

1634
01:27:35,291 --> 01:27:37,710
No need to cancel my funeral.

1635
01:27:38,503 --> 01:27:40,255
And MK knows that I'm alive.

1636
01:27:41,422 --> 01:27:44,634
-No doubt they'll send a new killer.
-What the hell do you think you're doing?

1637
01:27:45,969 --> 01:27:48,012
Mantis,
I did some thinking after we spoke.

1638
01:27:52,141 --> 01:27:53,518
I realized

1639
01:27:54,435 --> 01:27:56,396
if I can't be someone who is needed,

1640
01:27:57,105 --> 01:27:58,231
I knew

1641
01:27:59,274 --> 01:28:00,650
I'd rather not be anything.

1642
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:02,944
I'd rather not exist.

[mysterious music continues]

1646
01:28:30,930 --> 01:28:33,141
You really screwed it on this one.

1647
01:28:33,224 --> 01:28:35,018
This isn't something
I can cover up for you.

1648
01:28:35,101 --> 01:28:36,311
You know that, right?

1649
01:28:36,811 --> 01:28:37,812
[Mantis] I know.

1650
01:28:41,816 --> 01:28:44,360
It's a total shit show.

1651
01:28:45,361 --> 01:28:47,196
Jae-yi sent me this one.

1652
01:28:47,989 --> 01:28:49,657
Figure I'd reuse it for you.

1653
01:28:50,825 --> 01:28:52,618
And I'm supposed to take it.

01:29:01,169 --> 01:29:04,005
I'm only approaching this quietly
because of who you are.

1657
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:09,469
When are you gonna meet with Jae-yi?

1658
01:29:12,388 --> 01:29:14,057
I'll be meeting her first, then you.

1659
01:29:19,228 --> 01:29:21,397
Call once you have a location and a time.

01:29:52,136 --> 01:29:54,847
How did you feel
when you sent Min-kyu that knife?

1665
01:29:57,225 --> 01:29:59,519
Oh, about the same
that you feel at this moment.

1666
01:29:59,602 --> 01:30:02,355
It feels like crap for everyone,
both sender and receiver.

1667
01:30:02,855 --> 01:30:06,359
You're bound to receive the bloody knife
from the person who was closest to you.

If you want to protect something,
then you just do it.

Then again, that crafty senior of yours
is a strong one.

Wait, repeat what you just said.

1679
01:31:00,663 --> 01:31:03,916
Old man, listen.
I sent that knife you gave me to Jae-yi.

I want you to have that old clunker.

Why are you speaking like I'm never
seeing you again? See you tomorrow.

I'm going.

[Su-min] Come to think of it,

1691
01:32:16,072 --> 01:32:18,866
B also liked A, or so I think.

1692
01:32:22,328 --> 01:32:23,496
What did you say?

1693
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:28,417
A and B you mentioned,
who were buddies long ago.

1694
01:32:30,253 --> 01:32:31,504
Well, that's…

1695
01:32:32,463 --> 01:32:34,882
that's what C,
who might have had a crush once on A,

1696

This isn't necessary.

01:33:11,794 --> 01:33:13,546
I'll wait on the first floor, okay?

1705
01:33:13,629 --> 01:33:15,548
Before we go in, we should chat.

Think you'd have a chance
if it was a two-on-one fight?

Actually, this will work out nicer.

1737

Shin Jae-yi, what are you doing?!

1738
01:35:31,016 --> 01:35:32,977
I wanna be clear, Chairwoman Shin.

1739
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:35,229
This isn't a two-on-one fight.

1740
01:35:36,147 --> 01:35:37,398
First, it's just me and Mantis.

1741
01:35:37,481 --> 01:35:39,942
Unfortunately, he must fight
in front of what makes him weak.

1742
01:35:40,025 --> 01:35:41,569
He's trying to get you angry.

1743
01:35:41,652 --> 01:35:43,112

[Jae-yi sighs]

1745
01:35:47,742 --> 01:35:49,243
Stay focused!

1746
01:35:55,541 --> 01:35:56,709
What the fuck is your game?!

1747
01:35:56,792 --> 01:35:58,127
Fuck you.

1748
01:35:58,753 --> 01:36:00,755
No one agreed to a two-on-one.

1749
01:36:01,338 --> 01:36:03,382
This is one-on-one-on-one.

I spoke the truth.

I told you to quit spending time on her.

01:39:15,324 --> 01:39:17,451
[Jae-yi] Now his legs
are just as messed up as yours.

01:39:17,534 --> 01:39:19,662
Looks like you're both at a disadvantage.

1793
01:39:20,162 --> 01:39:22,498
It seems Jae-yi's smarter than you are.

1794

that I'll never stop.

Retire.

1816

Let's end it at that.

[Jae-yi crying softly]

1838

Did you really have to do that?

1839
01:43:20,027 --> 01:43:22,571
You have a habit of pitying others…

1840
01:43:24,823 --> 01:43:27,618
and that makes them miserable
in your presence.

1841
01:43:31,246 --> 01:43:34,708
When you extended your hand to me
back then, it was out of pity.

1842
01:43:35,876 --> 01:43:37,878
I knew you let me win the fight.

I regret it at times.

I should've pretended not to know.

1846
01:43:56,939 --> 01:43:59,316
Maybe I should've just taken your hand.

1847
01:44:03,570 --> 01:44:05,572
I'm not sure where that would've led.

Uh…

01:46:06,651 --> 01:46:08,653
[music fades]

1858
01:46:08,737 --> 01:46:10,781
[Benjamin] It's a cruel world out there.

1859
01:46:11,406 --> 01:46:13,492
The strong prey on the weak.

1860
01:46:13,992 --> 01:46:16,203
And the weak are eaten alive.

1861
01:46:17,579 --> 01:46:20,290
How do we survive in a world like this?

1862
01:46:20,374 --> 01:46:22,334
By following the example of the world.

1863
01:46:23,210 --> 01:46:25,128
We should be cruel and powerful.

1864
01:46:25,212 --> 01:46:28,465
So what do we need
to get started on this path?

1865
01:46:28,548 --> 01:46:29,383
[man] Authority!

1866
01:46:30,092 --> 01:46:31,385
[woman] Money!

1867
01:46:31,468 --> 01:46:32,928
[man 2] Our parents' money!

[audience chuckles]

1869
01:46:34,930 --> 01:46:36,848
[Benjamin] Parents' money.
That's a good one.

1870
01:46:36,932 --> 01:46:40,727
Authority and wealth,
you don't need those to gain power.

1871
01:46:40,811 --> 01:46:43,021
Those are the trophies power gets you.

1872
01:46:43,730 --> 01:46:46,066
Here's your first step to success.

1873
01:46:47,484 --> 01:46:48,777
Being able to time things right.

1874
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:53,156
We live in a world where
yesterday's friend becomes today's enemy.

1875
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:55,784
And today's enemy is tomorrow's ally.

1876
01:46:55,867 --> 01:46:57,661
Sometimes we are the prey,

1877
01:46:57,744 --> 01:46:59,955
and sometimes we're the predator.

1878
01:47:00,038 --> 01:47:02,749
We must be ready
to take a stand and fight back

1879
01:47:02,833 --> 01:47:05,001
and know when to avoid a fight.

1880
01:47:05,627 --> 01:47:08,130
Just knowing the right time to strike

1881
01:47:09,423 --> 01:47:10,841
begins your successful path.

1882
01:47:13,844 --> 01:47:14,886
[applause]

1883
01:47:14,970 --> 01:47:17,013
Fantastic speech, sir.

1884
01:47:17,097 --> 01:47:19,683
I sure hope that
this heartfelt message reaches the youth.

-Thanks.

1886

Real nice job out there.

You liked the message?

1888
01:47:25,188 --> 01:47:26,648
Most definitely. It struck a chord.

1889
01:47:26,731 --> 01:47:28,775
The section about
knowing the right moment to strike.

1890
01:47:28,859 --> 01:47:30,735
Of course. That was the important section.

1891
01:47:30,819 --> 01:47:34,614
-The MK takeover, is it going well?
-Yes. We'll be finished very soon.

1892
01:47:34,698 --> 01:47:35,657
Congrats.

1893
01:47:36,158 --> 01:47:37,784
I really picked the right one for the job.

1894
01:47:37,868 --> 01:47:39,536
Raising you has brought such joy.

1895
01:47:39,619 --> 01:47:40,912
I owe it all to you, sir.

1896
01:47:40,996 --> 01:47:43,081
Give me a status report tomorrow.

1897
01:47:44,207 --> 01:47:45,500

1899
01:47:53,884 --> 01:47:55,343
When's our time to strike?

[Benjamin] Huh?

1903
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:11,234
[Jae-yi] I passed it off

1904
01:48:11,318 --> 01:48:13,653
to an up-and-coming group needing a show.

1905
01:48:18,366 --> 01:48:20,327
Didn't I tell you, motherfucker,

1906
01:48:20,410 --> 01:48:23,580
that the next time you saw me,
you'd be dead, huh?!
