THE PEOPLE, GROUPS, PLACES, AND INCIDENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE PURELY FICTIONAL

3
00:00:47,977 --> 00:00:49,145
Why...

4
00:00:51,147 --> 00:00:52,857
are you here?

5
00:00:59,864 --> 00:01:02,116
I am your concubine.

6
00:01:05,661 --> 00:01:07,955
I will live as your woman.

7
00:01:08,873 --> 00:01:10,416
To do that,

8
00:01:14,545 --> 00:01:16,338
I will become the Queen.

9
00:01:47,745 --> 00:01:49,455
Explain yourself.

10
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,503
Tell me...

11
00:01:56,837 --> 00:01:57,963
the real reason.

12
00:02:01,842 --> 00:02:03,636
It is my choice.

13
00:02:21,987 --> 00:02:23,781
As an acknowledgment of her contributions

14
00:02:24,782 --> 00:02:26,492
I will allow her veil to be lifted.

15
00:02:28,077 --> 00:02:30,496
Thank you for your kindness, Your Majesty.

EPISODE 7

17
00:03:03,863 --> 00:03:05,030
Who are you?

18
00:03:06,866 --> 00:03:08,242
Where is Lady Park?

19
00:03:10,077 --> 00:03:11,662
Where did you hide her?

20
00:03:11,745 --> 00:03:13,831
Lady Park is at the feast.

21
00:03:14,707 --> 00:03:16,375
Why do you look for her here?

22
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:17,710
Silence!

23
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,506
What trick are you two pulling?

24
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,259
We would never do such a thing.

25
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,220
I work for Lady Cho.

26
00:03:29,346 --> 00:03:30,472
What?

27
00:03:34,018 --> 00:03:37,104
I went to Chaeokdang
to run an errand for Lady Cho

28
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:40,524
when he asked for my help.

29
00:03:40,858 --> 00:03:42,359
Please believe me.

30
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:46,197
How dare you lie to my face?

31
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:50,910
Tell me the truth now.

32
00:03:50,993 --> 00:03:52,661
Where is Lady Park?

33
00:03:52,745 --> 00:03:56,665
Please. I have no idea
what you are talking about.

34
00:03:56,999 --> 00:03:58,584
You wench!

35
00:03:58,667 --> 00:03:59,919
Chief Eunuch!

36
00:04:01,462 --> 00:04:03,130
Leave with the court lady.

37
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,112
My lord.

38
00:04:28,739 --> 00:04:30,824
Lady Park can't be far.

39
00:04:30,908 --> 00:04:33,202
-We must hurry--
-Lady Park is at the feast.

40
00:04:35,746 --> 00:04:37,206
You deceived me.

41
00:04:38,123 --> 00:04:39,208
I…

42
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:42,753
would not dare to deceive you.

43
00:04:43,087 --> 00:04:45,589
I'm certain she was planning to escape.

44
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:50,261
How else would I have known
about Eunuch Jung leaving the palace?

45
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,638
I will confirm

46
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:55,224
whether you are lying or not.

47
00:04:56,016 --> 00:04:57,893
My lord!

48
00:04:58,269 --> 00:04:59,645
Please spare me of this place.

49
00:05:00,062 --> 00:05:02,606
My lord!

50
00:05:03,023 --> 00:05:04,108
Let me go.

51
00:05:04,608 --> 00:05:05,651
My lord!

52
00:05:16,161 --> 00:05:17,204
What happened?

53
00:05:18,414 --> 00:05:21,375
Miss decided to stay in the palace.

54
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,127
You should have insisted she come.

55
00:05:23,335 --> 00:05:25,462
Didn't I tell you it is for her own good?

56
00:05:26,005 --> 00:05:29,174
She said she has unfinished business.

57
00:05:29,258 --> 00:05:31,176
The only reason I did as you said

58
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,512
was because I thought Miss
wanted to escape.

59
00:05:33,887 --> 00:05:36,265
She should stay if that's her will.

60
00:05:55,576 --> 00:05:59,121
How could you be so cruel
to the Chief Eunuch?

61
00:06:00,914 --> 00:06:04,960
He insulted the royal family
with a heinous lie.

62
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:06,795
Did you not tell me

63
00:06:07,087 --> 00:06:10,549
that Lady Park…
was planning to escape from the palace?

64
00:06:13,886 --> 00:06:15,763
You claimed His Majesty
was aiding her too.

65
00:06:15,846 --> 00:06:17,431
Stating that His Majesty and Lady Park…

66
00:06:23,562 --> 00:06:25,481
seemed to have a special relationship.

67
00:06:29,193 --> 00:06:30,402
That is a lie!

68
00:06:30,486 --> 00:06:34,740
I would not dare to tell such a lie.

69
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,326
Please.

70
00:06:38,243 --> 00:06:42,373
I did not make such an absurd statement.

71
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,501
That is enough.

72
00:06:46,085 --> 00:06:48,003
It is an insult to His Majesty

73
00:06:48,087 --> 00:06:49,880
for a servant to harm his close aide.

74
00:06:49,963 --> 00:06:53,425
The Chief Eunuch knows this
better than anyone.

75
00:06:53,884 --> 00:06:55,219
He will never speak.

76
00:06:57,513 --> 00:06:59,765
What is it that you want to confirm?

77
00:07:00,516 --> 00:07:04,561
I sensed His Majesty and you
were hiding something from me.

78
00:07:05,854 --> 00:07:07,689
My doubts would have been confirmed

79
00:07:08,941 --> 00:07:10,651
if it was because of Lady Park.

80
00:07:16,115 --> 00:07:17,241
My niece

81
00:07:18,325 --> 00:07:20,619
has the King's affection.

82
00:07:21,954 --> 00:07:26,667
That would explain
why His Majesty has been postponing

83
00:07:28,085 --> 00:07:29,711
his consummation with Lady Cho.

84
00:07:31,213 --> 00:07:34,591
Did I not tell you, Minister?

85
00:07:35,968 --> 00:07:38,178
Do not trust His Majesty.

86
00:07:53,485 --> 00:07:56,071
Put the sword down this instant!

87
00:08:16,758 --> 00:08:18,218
Did you forget?

88
00:08:18,302 --> 00:08:20,053
You and I.

89
00:08:21,472 --> 00:08:24,016
We were comrades
who went through life and death.

90
00:08:27,895 --> 00:08:29,521
We were friends.

91
00:08:56,965 --> 00:08:57,841
My lord.

92
00:08:58,467 --> 00:09:02,262
I will report the atrocious acts
of Minister Cho

93
00:09:02,846 --> 00:09:04,765
to His Majesty.

94
00:09:05,307 --> 00:09:06,475
How dare he!

95
00:09:07,768 --> 00:09:09,770
He had the nerve
to slander you and Lady Park--

96
00:09:09,853 --> 00:09:11,939
You no longer have the King's favor.

97
00:09:12,564 --> 00:09:14,650
No servant would fear you now.

98
00:09:15,734 --> 00:09:17,486
It seems like His Majesty

99
00:09:17,569 --> 00:09:20,572
preferred you better as a watchman.

100
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,700
You became aware of it.

101
00:09:23,784 --> 00:09:26,870
That's why you went around
looking for a way to save yourself.

102
00:09:32,751 --> 00:09:33,877
Listen, Chief Eunuch.

103
00:09:36,588 --> 00:09:38,590
Prove how useful you can be.

104
00:09:39,967 --> 00:09:42,094
A beast with no use…

105
00:09:44,137 --> 00:09:45,639
is nothing but prey.

106
00:10:02,489 --> 00:10:04,783
Tell Inspector General Yoon

107
00:10:04,866 --> 00:10:07,536
to seize Eunuch Heo's account book.

108
00:10:07,619 --> 00:10:08,996
I shall relay the message.

109
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,348
<i>Why did she return?</i>

110
00:10:30,142 --> 00:10:31,310
<i>Why in the world?</i>

111
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,069
<i>There is something</i>

112
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:44,031
<i>I must do in this palace now.</i>

113
00:10:46,658 --> 00:10:48,577
<i>A day will come</i>

114
00:10:49,911 --> 00:10:51,038
<i>when I can tell you.</i>

115
00:11:11,433 --> 00:11:13,268
I will make another opportunity.

116
00:11:15,228 --> 00:11:16,563
There is no need.

117
00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:20,150
I plan to live in the palace now.

118
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,444
My lady.

119
00:11:23,528 --> 00:11:24,529
That is right.

120
00:11:26,239 --> 00:11:28,992
I am Lady Park.
A second junior rank concubine.

121
00:11:29,076 --> 00:11:30,869
I am Councilor Park's niece.

122
00:11:31,536 --> 00:11:33,955
And I may even become the queen one day.

123
00:11:39,002 --> 00:11:41,588
Why the sudden change of heart?

124
00:11:42,172 --> 00:11:45,008
People I consider my family
are locked up as I said.

125
00:11:45,092 --> 00:11:46,593
I will save them--

126
00:11:46,677 --> 00:11:48,387
How will you?

127
00:11:50,931 --> 00:11:54,017
Will you command the governor
to release them under the King's order?

128
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:57,270
Or do you plan to save them
by leading an army?

129
00:11:58,271 --> 00:12:00,190
Even if that were possible,

130
00:12:01,525 --> 00:12:02,859
yet another life

131
00:12:04,277 --> 00:12:06,530
would be sacrificed for that cause.

132
00:12:14,663 --> 00:12:16,498
I no longer believe in you.

133
00:12:19,292 --> 00:12:20,752
I will become the queen...

134
00:12:21,336 --> 00:12:23,588
and release them myself.

135
00:12:34,683 --> 00:12:37,352
I gave you my answer, Councilor.

136
00:12:45,777 --> 00:12:46,903
Does my answer

137
00:12:47,821 --> 00:12:49,072
suffice?

138
00:12:50,574 --> 00:12:52,075
It does.

139
00:12:52,534 --> 00:12:55,078
Then release the people
of Bamboo Grove Village.

140
00:12:55,495 --> 00:12:57,748
You threatened me
into becoming a concubine.

141
00:12:57,831 --> 00:12:59,958
But staying at the palace is my will.

142
00:13:00,917 --> 00:13:01,960
I…

143
00:13:02,836 --> 00:13:06,882
do not trust
the heart and words of others.

144
00:13:07,466 --> 00:13:10,093
My authority over their life or death

145
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:14,264
will help me trust you, Lady Park.

146
00:13:26,276 --> 00:13:27,277
I…

147
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,655
plan to use the King's affection.

148
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:36,203
So before His Majesty makes Lady Cho
the queen out of spite towards you,

149
00:13:36,995 --> 00:13:39,080
hurry and appoint me as queen.

150
00:13:40,332 --> 00:13:41,625
Will you…

151
00:13:43,627 --> 00:13:45,170
be able to sway the King's heart?

152
00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:47,005
Answer me this.

153
00:13:47,088 --> 00:13:50,342
Will you even be able to mention
this matter in the royal court?

154
00:13:51,343 --> 00:13:55,138
I have heard you could not bring it up
due to the three-year mourning period.

155
00:13:56,306 --> 00:13:57,724
Can you destroy…

156
00:13:59,768 --> 00:14:01,144
their justification?

157
00:14:11,321 --> 00:14:12,697
Can you do it?

158
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,286
It is not a problem.

159
00:14:26,211 --> 00:14:27,587
I was prepared

160
00:14:28,797 --> 00:14:31,800
to bite my own tongue and die instead.

161
00:14:32,342 --> 00:14:33,552
I swear

162
00:14:33,635 --> 00:14:38,974
I did not tell them you sent me
to Chaeokdang to spy on Lady Park.

163
00:14:40,308 --> 00:14:41,393
That is why

164
00:14:42,018 --> 00:14:44,145
even when I got caught
by the Chief Eunuch,

165
00:14:44,813 --> 00:14:47,357
I insisted that was not the case.

166
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,152
That you never ordered such a command.

167
00:14:51,236 --> 00:14:55,365
That's how I ended up outside the palace.
Please believe me.

168
00:14:55,448 --> 00:14:57,492
Enough whining and leave us.

169
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,204
Yes, my lady.

170
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:11,506
How could you order your own
court lady to spy on Chaeokdang?

171
00:15:12,591 --> 00:15:15,719
Ttonggeum insisted first. So I let her be.

172
00:15:15,802 --> 00:15:17,846
Yes, I'm sure that was the case.

173
00:15:18,305 --> 00:15:19,723
It's the truth.

174
00:15:21,016 --> 00:15:22,893
But why did you call for Ttonggeum
all of a sudden?

175
00:15:22,976 --> 00:15:24,311
I don't know either.

176
00:15:24,728 --> 00:15:27,314
I was simply following Father's order.

177
00:15:27,981 --> 00:15:32,068
How did he know
that Ttonggeum left the palace?

178
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,582
<i>Win the King's affection
by using whatever means necessary.</i>

179
00:15:45,874 --> 00:15:50,003
<i>I will find a way to justify
the need to appoint a queen.</i>

180
00:16:07,979 --> 00:16:09,189
I checked in on Yeonghwadang.

181
00:16:09,898 --> 00:16:12,359
That girl, Ttonggeum
didn't leave Lady Cho's side

182
00:16:12,442 --> 00:16:15,028
as she slandered you.

183
00:16:15,862 --> 00:16:17,447
I told her to go far away.

184
00:16:25,288 --> 00:16:26,331
Court Lady Choi.

185
00:16:26,414 --> 00:16:28,541
Any word from the Queen Dowager?

186
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:32,295
Yes, she said you may head over now.

187
00:16:42,681 --> 00:16:46,977
Shall I prepare shades
for the Queen Dowager, Your Majesty?

188
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:47,936
Yes, see to it.

189
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,438
I will see to it myself.

190
00:16:55,193 --> 00:16:58,655
The Queen Dowager disdains the smell here.

191
00:16:58,738 --> 00:17:00,824
What is her intention in coming here?

192
00:17:05,954 --> 00:17:07,247
Or is Lady Park behind this?

193
00:17:12,877 --> 00:17:13,962
Your Majesty.

194
00:17:14,421 --> 00:17:17,716
The Queen Dowager sent word
she'll be absent due to an upset stomach.

195
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:19,634
How unfortunate.

196
00:17:20,552 --> 00:17:21,970
I will send a royal physician over.

197
00:17:22,637 --> 00:17:23,888
Thank you for your grace.

198
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:28,435
All the horses seem docile.

199
00:17:43,533 --> 00:17:45,243
This is truly a gentle one.

200
00:17:48,496 --> 00:17:52,167
Going out for a ride on a beautiful day
like this would be perfect.

201
00:17:56,463 --> 00:17:59,966
I wished to see your face
in broad daylight.

202
00:18:01,926 --> 00:18:03,720
My wish has been fulfilled.

203
00:18:16,608 --> 00:18:18,276
I won't disturb you anymore.

204
00:18:21,488 --> 00:18:24,866
Someone needs to ride the horse
in order to check its condition.

205
00:18:28,078 --> 00:18:29,454
You may follow.

206
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,585
I will find another way for you to leave.

207
00:19:18,211 --> 00:19:19,754
I will not leave.

208
00:19:21,047 --> 00:19:23,049
I plan to spend my life here.

209
00:19:32,517 --> 00:19:34,561
What are you hiding from me?

210
00:19:37,981 --> 00:19:40,275
I entered the secret passage
for a brief moment.

211
00:19:41,276 --> 00:19:43,570
It was pitch black and damp.

212
00:19:44,821 --> 00:19:47,031
I was afraid to take a step forward.

213
00:19:50,535 --> 00:19:51,703
How…

214
00:19:54,497 --> 00:19:55,915
did you take that path…

215
00:19:57,917 --> 00:19:59,544
every 15 days?

216
00:20:16,394 --> 00:20:18,438
Did Councilor Park order you?

217
00:20:20,315 --> 00:20:22,525
Did he order you to tempt me?

218
00:20:23,651 --> 00:20:25,403
To get a hold of my affection?

219
00:20:25,486 --> 00:20:26,613
So that…

220
00:20:28,823 --> 00:20:30,533
you can become the queen?

221
00:20:32,785 --> 00:20:36,539
Did you truly come back to become Queen?

222
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:42,337
What is going on?

223
00:20:45,673 --> 00:20:46,925
Your Majesty.

224
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,596
I love you.

225
00:20:54,098 --> 00:20:56,392
I wanted to reveal my feelings.

226
00:20:57,977 --> 00:20:59,103
If it were even for a moment…

227
00:21:01,689 --> 00:21:04,275
I wanted time to be with you.

228
00:21:07,528 --> 00:21:08,738
I…

229
00:21:11,366 --> 00:21:13,076
love you too.

230
00:21:22,961 --> 00:21:25,838
But my love and feelings

231
00:21:26,631 --> 00:21:28,174
are completely useless.

232
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,802
You are Councilor Park's niece,

233
00:21:30,885 --> 00:21:32,679
an enemy I must eradicate.

234
00:21:33,846 --> 00:21:36,641
No matter whom I love,

235
00:21:37,267 --> 00:21:38,685
that fact will never change.

236
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:42,146
You are not…

237
00:21:44,774 --> 00:21:45,817
the woman I need.

238
00:21:48,152 --> 00:21:49,153
So…

239
00:21:51,781 --> 00:21:53,366
do not try to tempt me.

240
00:22:13,219 --> 00:22:15,346
Is the King still with Lady Park?

241
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,347
Yes, Your Highness.

242
00:22:16,431 --> 00:22:19,142
They went horseback riding together.

243
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,021
There's no way he wouldn't see through
this obvious trick.

244
00:22:25,148 --> 00:22:27,025
I sense his relationship with Lady Park

245
00:22:28,276 --> 00:22:29,819
is deeper than I thought.

246
00:22:41,622 --> 00:22:42,915
During the three-step selection,

247
00:22:42,999 --> 00:22:45,835
you said my desires
would only be half-fulfilled.

248
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:47,712
You were right.

249
00:22:48,296 --> 00:22:51,466
-I'm impressed with your gift.
-Thank you, Your Highness.

250
00:22:58,681 --> 00:23:01,142
Find out a consummate date
that will ensure the birth of a son.

251
00:23:02,643 --> 00:23:04,145
My ability falls short…

252
00:23:04,228 --> 00:23:06,689
You communicate with the spirit.

253
00:23:07,273 --> 00:23:09,525
Try begging her by saying
your life depends on it.

254
00:23:09,609 --> 00:23:10,610
I am sure

255
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,196
she will answer you then.

256
00:23:23,164 --> 00:23:27,001
<i>There's talk of a monk who is thought to
be the incarnation of Buddha in Tongjin.</i>

257
00:23:27,335 --> 00:23:28,836
<i>Visit that monk.</i>

258
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,655
Holding a temporary
civil service examination

259
00:24:12,072 --> 00:24:14,158
to select an official was a wise decision.

260
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,161
Your Majesty.

261
00:24:17,995 --> 00:24:19,789
The royal court is not understaffed.

262
00:24:20,247 --> 00:24:22,458
What is your reason
for conducting this exam?

263
00:24:23,042 --> 00:24:25,586
I ask you to choose
from families within the royal court.

264
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:27,630
Why are you against this?

265
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:31,342
The method you suggest
only brings in pathetic officials.

266
00:24:31,592 --> 00:24:34,428
Nonetheless, we can't allow the Sarim
into the royal court!

267
00:24:41,811 --> 00:24:43,062
Your Majesty!

268
00:24:54,031 --> 00:24:58,244
<i>The King is the spitting image
of that scholar.</i>

269
00:24:59,495 --> 00:25:01,789
Why are you here, Lady Cho?

270
00:25:01,872 --> 00:25:03,207
I called for her.

271
00:25:04,667 --> 00:25:08,128
Spend some quality time
at the back garden.

272
00:25:08,212 --> 00:25:09,630
I am grateful, Your Majesty.

273
00:25:10,339 --> 00:25:14,468
I am overjoyed by your thoughtfulness.

274
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,727
I complained about how distant we became.

275
00:25:23,811 --> 00:25:25,813
He kindly made time for us to meet.

276
00:25:27,982 --> 00:25:28,983
You like him that much?

277
00:25:29,567 --> 00:25:30,818
Absolutely.

278
00:25:31,694 --> 00:25:36,532
His Majesty is a loving husband
just like you and my brother.

279
00:25:39,827 --> 00:25:40,953
<i>My niece</i>

280
00:25:41,453 --> 00:25:43,956
has the King's affection.

281
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,335
Without Minister Cho's support,

282
00:25:48,752 --> 00:25:51,171
the temporary civil service examination
will not be possible.

283
00:25:51,255 --> 00:25:52,423
I am aware.

284
00:25:53,507 --> 00:25:54,717
But it seems

285
00:25:55,843 --> 00:25:57,845
Minister Cho doesn't trust me.

286
00:26:38,218 --> 00:26:41,430
What is making you hesitate so much?

287
00:26:44,683 --> 00:26:47,353
Is it about speeding up
the process to select the queen?

288
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,906
Your Highness.

289
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,618
I ask…

290
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:07,081
you become our irrefutable reason.

291
00:27:17,174 --> 00:27:18,676
For that to happen,

292
00:27:20,302 --> 00:27:22,262
I will have to vacate the Internal Court.

293
00:27:23,389 --> 00:27:25,599
If Minister Cho pressures His Majesty,

294
00:27:26,392 --> 00:27:28,060
it won't be easy.

295
00:27:28,143 --> 00:27:30,354
You come begging to me

296
00:27:31,188 --> 00:27:33,273
because you can't go up against that fool?

297
00:27:41,323 --> 00:27:42,658
It is for the country.

298
00:27:48,163 --> 00:27:50,874
It is for the royal family's stability.

299
00:27:53,293 --> 00:27:54,336
I beg you.

300
00:27:56,296 --> 00:27:58,048
As the head of the royal family,

301
00:27:59,049 --> 00:28:01,218
please make a decision.

302
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:21,113
I beg you…

303
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:25,784
Please…

304
00:28:29,955 --> 00:28:32,124
be His Majesty's royal concubine.

305
00:29:20,172 --> 00:29:22,549
If I suddenly fall ill,

306
00:29:24,551 --> 00:29:26,261
everyone will become suspicious.

307
00:29:36,814 --> 00:29:37,689
Your Highness.

308
00:29:55,999 --> 00:29:57,292
It's dangerous.

309
00:29:58,377 --> 00:29:59,545
Move away from the edge.

310
00:30:00,921 --> 00:30:02,840
I will grant your wish.

311
00:30:04,508 --> 00:30:05,551
For you…

312
00:30:06,677 --> 00:30:09,388
I will offer myself as cause
to justify the selection.

313
00:30:18,814 --> 00:30:21,650
<i>That look of worry for me on your face.</i>

314
00:30:22,234 --> 00:30:24,736
<i>That is more than enough for me.</i>

315
00:31:45,234 --> 00:31:46,735
Why?

316
00:31:48,153 --> 00:31:49,529
What is making you this sick?

317
00:31:51,406 --> 00:31:52,532
Is it time

318
00:31:53,367 --> 00:31:54,826
for me to let you go?

319
00:32:33,907 --> 00:32:35,826
How are you feeling?

320
00:32:37,744 --> 00:32:38,870
Never again.

321
00:32:39,538 --> 00:32:41,832
Do not ever do that again.

322
00:32:44,376 --> 00:32:48,588
How could you always be so reckless?

323
00:32:50,048 --> 00:32:51,133
Always?

324
00:32:54,845 --> 00:32:57,431
You always save me.

325
00:32:58,682 --> 00:32:59,975
That is why.

326
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,145
I act recklessly with ease.

327
00:33:11,737 --> 00:33:13,238
Why is the royal physician outside?

328
00:33:14,781 --> 00:33:16,950
His Majesty enters.

329
00:33:24,082 --> 00:33:29,379
I came running to you
the instant I heard you fell in the pond.

330
00:33:29,838 --> 00:33:31,256
What happened?

331
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,592
Is it true that you tripped?

332
00:33:33,842 --> 00:33:37,471
Yes, now please stop shouting.

333
00:33:38,764 --> 00:33:40,307
It's making me dizzy.

334
00:33:48,106 --> 00:33:51,109
The royal physician will do his best.

335
00:33:54,905 --> 00:33:56,782
So please, do not worry.

336
00:34:00,118 --> 00:34:01,828
Everyone, leave me.

337
00:34:44,496 --> 00:34:48,125
<i>The Internal Court is empty now.</i>

338
00:35:22,242 --> 00:35:23,493
Do you

339
00:35:23,577 --> 00:35:27,372
really promise to let me go
if I tell you what I know?

340
00:35:31,209 --> 00:35:33,753
I will if you tell me something useful.

341
00:35:36,131 --> 00:35:37,299
Our lady

342
00:35:38,133 --> 00:35:40,677
was brought to our village by someone.

343
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,095
Who was it?

344
00:35:42,471 --> 00:35:44,222
He looked like a eunuch.

345
00:35:44,306 --> 00:35:45,849
I clearly heard

346
00:35:46,266 --> 00:35:49,394
Master Lim ask
about eunuchs in the palace.

347
00:35:49,478 --> 00:35:50,395
A eunuch?

348
00:36:06,453 --> 00:36:08,663
I've been suffering from nightmares
ever since I fell.

349
00:36:08,747 --> 00:36:10,832
It's been so long
since I slept through the night.

350
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:16,254
Which is why I will go to Prince Seogang's
residence and recuperate there.

351
00:36:16,922 --> 00:36:19,216
-I'm heartbroken, Your Highness.
-I'm heartbroken, Your Highness.

352
00:36:19,799 --> 00:36:21,051
While I am away,

353
00:36:22,802 --> 00:36:25,096
I would like the two of you
to oversee the Internal Court.

354
00:36:32,521 --> 00:36:35,357
Discuss and tend to events
that have been postponed.

355
00:36:36,024 --> 00:36:38,527
Including the banquet in honor of me.

356
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,446
How surprising.

357
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:44,950
I thought she would entrust you
with everything, but I was wrong.

358
00:36:46,701 --> 00:36:50,497
I will show her I am an indispensable
member of the Internal Court.

359
00:36:51,206 --> 00:36:53,291
That is already the case, Lady Cho.

360
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:56,795
Not to mention
how valuable you are to His Majesty.

361
00:37:13,478 --> 00:37:14,521
Eumjeon.

362
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:19,025
If any one of Lady Cho's people
picks a fight, make sure to fight back.

363
00:37:19,651 --> 00:37:21,778
The more noise, the better.

364
00:37:23,446 --> 00:37:24,489
Yes, Lady Park.

365
00:37:25,532 --> 00:37:26,950
-My gosh.
-What is that?

366
00:37:27,033 --> 00:37:29,703
-What's all this ruckus?
-Rats, Court Lady Kim.

367
00:37:29,786 --> 00:37:31,621
There are rats over there.

368
00:37:33,123 --> 00:37:36,293
Gosh, whoever it is
rounded up a whole bunch.

369
00:37:36,376 --> 00:37:38,837
Whoever it was,
they went through a lot of trouble.

370
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,797
Lady Cho mustn't see that hideous sight.

371
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,757
-Clean it up this instant.
-But…

372
00:37:42,841 --> 00:37:44,384
Now.

373
00:37:48,096 --> 00:37:49,180
I want dried persimmons.

374
00:37:49,264 --> 00:37:51,808
-We'll give you one.
-You'll get it Ttonggeum.

375
00:37:51,891 --> 00:37:53,893
-Please, just quickly clean it up.
-I want five.

376
00:37:53,977 --> 00:37:55,312
-Okay, sure.
-We'll give you five.

377
00:37:55,979 --> 00:37:57,981
Goodness.

378
00:37:58,565 --> 00:37:59,608
Court Lady Kim.

379
00:37:59,691 --> 00:38:02,527
Chaeokdang must be responsible for this.
They are trying to hex us.

380
00:38:02,611 --> 00:38:04,821
This isn't the first time
something like this happened.

381
00:38:04,904 --> 00:38:07,073
Stop your nonsense
and prepare for the banquet.

382
00:38:07,157 --> 00:38:10,410
Even if we wanted to, we're being
bullied by the Supplies Officer.

383
00:38:10,493 --> 00:38:12,162
This is all because of Chaeokdang.

384
00:38:14,247 --> 00:38:15,790
How could you do this again?

385
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:18,960
You must open the storage for us
so we can prepare for the banquet.

386
00:38:19,252 --> 00:38:20,462
It is beyond my authority.

387
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,007
Chaeokdang requested the goods first.
So there's nothing I can do.

388
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:26,051
We clearly requested it first.

389
00:38:26,134 --> 00:38:27,218
Court Lady Kim.

390
00:38:27,302 --> 00:38:29,054
This is not the time to be stubborn.

391
00:38:30,347 --> 00:38:31,348
What?

392
00:38:32,474 --> 00:38:36,227
How dare you talk that way to her?

393
00:38:36,311 --> 00:38:38,813
-Know your place, you wench.
-What?

394
00:38:39,397 --> 00:38:40,815
You had this coming.

395
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:43,943
-What did you say?
-Stop this!

396
00:39:00,251 --> 00:39:03,380
<i>Tell me some scandalous news.</i>

397
00:39:04,464 --> 00:39:06,925
<i>Something the supervising
court ladies know,</i>

398
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,843
<i>but choose to silence it.</i>

399
00:39:10,804 --> 00:39:14,307
The bigger the noise and commotion,
the better.

400
00:39:26,653 --> 00:39:28,655
She committed adultery
with a royal family member.

401
00:39:28,905 --> 00:39:30,240
Tie her up this instant.

402
00:39:30,824 --> 00:39:32,617
-I'm innocent.
-No, wait.

403
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,169
A royal family member indebted to you

404
00:39:43,253 --> 00:39:45,588
committing adultery with a court lady
violates moral code.

405
00:39:45,672 --> 00:39:48,550
This disgusting act was conducted
at the vacant Crown Prince's Palace.

406
00:39:48,633 --> 00:39:50,802
I suspect this to be an act of treason.

407
00:39:50,885 --> 00:39:54,097
They must be sentenced
to exemplary punishment, Your Majesty.

408
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:57,809
Moreover, the scandalous events
that have been occurring

409
00:39:57,892 --> 00:40:00,311
within the palace are unspeakable.

410
00:40:00,395 --> 00:40:03,481
It's unacceptable that servants
are taking sides and fighting.

411
00:40:03,815 --> 00:40:07,152
This is all due to the fact
that the queen's position is vacant.

412
00:40:07,235 --> 00:40:09,446
I plead you will hurry
and select your queen

413
00:40:09,529 --> 00:40:12,115
to bring back order in the Internal Court.

414
00:40:15,577 --> 00:40:18,037
His Majesty set this beautiful precedent

415
00:40:18,121 --> 00:40:21,124
of mourning for three years
to pay respects to the late Queen.

416
00:40:21,207 --> 00:40:23,126
How could you suggest
he dispose of that courtesy?

417
00:40:23,209 --> 00:40:26,755
I strongly agree with the Chief Scholar.

418
00:40:27,547 --> 00:40:30,800
I have made an avowal
regarding the late Queen.

419
00:40:31,676 --> 00:40:33,511
I can't go back on my word.

420
00:40:34,554 --> 00:40:37,140
Flog the court ladies
involved in the gang fight.

421
00:40:37,724 --> 00:40:39,642
Once the Queen Dowager returns,

422
00:40:39,726 --> 00:40:41,352
it will be settled at the Internal Court.

423
00:40:42,854 --> 00:40:45,565
Prince Cheongsan will pay
for his crime with exile.

424
00:40:46,357 --> 00:40:47,567
As for the court lady,

425
00:40:48,902 --> 00:40:50,320
execute her.

426
00:41:10,757 --> 00:41:13,843
<i>His Majesty will play a bad hand.</i>

427
00:41:14,469 --> 00:41:16,471
<i>Members of the royal family will swarm in.</i>

428
00:41:17,055 --> 00:41:20,183
<i>He'll be forced to select a queen.</i>

429
00:41:27,899 --> 00:41:32,904
Please revoke your royal command
to exile Prince Cheongsan.

430
00:41:32,987 --> 00:41:35,073
-Please revoke your royal command
-Please revoke your royal command

431
00:41:35,156 --> 00:41:37,534
-to exile Prince Cheongsan.
-to exile Prince Cheongsan.

432
00:41:37,617 --> 00:41:42,580
Please revoke your royal command
to exile Prince Cheongsan.

433
00:41:42,997 --> 00:41:45,083
-Please revoke your royal command
-Please revoke your royal command

434
00:41:45,166 --> 00:41:47,126
-to exile Prince Cheongsan.
-to exile Prince Cheongsan.

435
00:41:53,591 --> 00:41:54,551
Your Majesty.

436
00:41:54,634 --> 00:41:56,386
It's precedent to punish
a royal family member

437
00:41:56,469 --> 00:41:59,305
who has committed adultery
with a court lady to probation.

438
00:41:59,389 --> 00:42:03,726
How could you sentence your family
to such a cruel punishment?

439
00:42:04,227 --> 00:42:06,229
-Uncle.
-The truth is

440
00:42:06,312 --> 00:42:10,108
you failed to rule your court lady.
This responsibility falls on you.

441
00:42:10,191 --> 00:42:13,945
I beg that you revoke your royal command
to exile Prince Cheongsan.

442
00:42:14,028 --> 00:42:16,322
-Please revoke your royal command
-Please revoke your royal command

443
00:42:16,406 --> 00:42:18,408
-to exile Prince Cheongsan.
-to exile Prince Cheongsan.

444
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,076
Your Majesty.

445
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:23,121
Do not forgive your relatives' arrogance.

446
00:42:23,204 --> 00:42:26,165
How dare the royal relatives
get involved with matters of the court?

447
00:42:27,709 --> 00:42:28,751
Your Majesty.

448
00:42:29,168 --> 00:42:32,505
We argue this happened
due to the absence of a queen.

449
00:42:32,589 --> 00:42:35,466
This is all because the Chief Scholar
pushed for the three-year mourning

450
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:38,303
and put a halt to selecting a queen.

451
00:42:38,761 --> 00:42:39,637
Prince!

452
00:42:54,944 --> 00:42:57,989
Strip Chief Scholar Kim Chiwon
of his official title

453
00:42:58,072 --> 00:43:01,075
and bring order to the Internal Court.

454
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:04,746
-Please bring order to the Internal Court.
-Please bring order to the Internal Court.

455
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:06,164
Your Majesty.

456
00:43:06,247 --> 00:43:08,791
Raise your guards against
the royal family members

457
00:43:08,875 --> 00:43:10,960
who overstep their boundaries
by interjecting in state affairs.

458
00:43:11,044 --> 00:43:14,422
-Raise your guards against them.
-Raise your guards against them.

459
00:43:15,924 --> 00:43:19,677
-Please bring order to the Internal Court.
-Please bring order to the Internal Court.

460
00:43:19,802 --> 00:43:23,640
-Raise your guards against them.
-Raise your guards against them.

461
00:43:28,353 --> 00:43:29,354
Kyun.

462
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:34,525
Yes, Your Majesty.

463
00:43:35,026 --> 00:43:37,028
It started at the Supplies Office.

464
00:43:37,111 --> 00:43:41,115
Find out whether
this was all a coincidence

465
00:43:42,784 --> 00:43:43,993
or a scheme.

466
00:43:52,627 --> 00:43:54,170
Are you the Supplies Officer?

467
00:43:54,837 --> 00:43:55,880
Who are you?

468
00:43:59,467 --> 00:44:01,928
Who ordered you to start a quarrel
amongst the Ladies'

469
00:44:02,595 --> 00:44:03,638
court ladies?

470
00:44:13,314 --> 00:44:15,358
His Majesty enters!

471
00:44:26,035 --> 00:44:27,662
Do you know Supplies Officer Han?

472
00:44:31,499 --> 00:44:32,417
I do.

473
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,795
He claims he was ordered to start
a quarrel amongst the court ladies.

474
00:44:36,379 --> 00:44:37,630
He named your Court Lady…

475
00:44:40,675 --> 00:44:42,802
as the abettor.

476
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:55,523
Who ordered you?

477
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:05,491
Lady Park is innocent.

478
00:45:05,575 --> 00:45:09,746
My excessive loyalty to my master
led me to act on my own accord.

479
00:45:09,829 --> 00:45:10,747
Which master?

480
00:45:16,335 --> 00:45:17,670
Shall I hand this over
to the State Tribunal?

481
00:45:20,923 --> 00:45:22,216
It was my order.

482
00:45:25,762 --> 00:45:28,973
She is my own, so punish me instead.

483
00:45:29,557 --> 00:45:30,767
I doubt

484
00:45:31,684 --> 00:45:33,478
you have anyone to call your own here.

485
00:45:36,355 --> 00:45:37,398
I do.

486
00:45:38,566 --> 00:45:43,071
I requested Councilor Park
that I may have command over them.

487
00:45:43,154 --> 00:45:44,322
Is that not right?

488
00:45:48,659 --> 00:45:49,786
Leave us.

489
00:46:17,814 --> 00:46:19,732
Was it truly your doing?

490
00:46:22,985 --> 00:46:23,820
Yes.

491
00:46:24,654 --> 00:46:25,738
Have you

492
00:46:27,448 --> 00:46:28,950
truly…

493
00:46:31,869 --> 00:46:34,288
decided to live as Councilor Park's niece
to become Queen?

494
00:46:36,874 --> 00:46:38,209
Did you forget?

495
00:46:38,835 --> 00:46:39,877
Councilor Park…

496
00:46:40,586 --> 00:46:42,922
is both an enemy of mine and yours.

497
00:46:43,798 --> 00:46:45,716
What do you plan to gain
from leeching on him?

498
00:46:46,801 --> 00:46:48,344
Is it because of your father's identity?

499
00:46:52,348 --> 00:46:53,432
I once…

500
00:46:55,852 --> 00:46:57,562
had a dream.

501
00:47:02,108 --> 00:47:04,735
I dreamt of catching the real culprit
who poisoned Queen Inyoung

502
00:47:06,279 --> 00:47:08,573
to clear my father's name.

503
00:47:13,786 --> 00:47:14,996
Now…

504
00:47:18,583 --> 00:47:19,917
that is no longer the case.

505
00:47:22,003 --> 00:47:23,171
Lady Park.

506
00:47:26,507 --> 00:47:28,926
You didn't return to become queen.

507
00:47:34,265 --> 00:47:36,475
So tell me why you returned.

508
00:47:38,436 --> 00:47:39,645
My people…

509
00:47:41,647 --> 00:47:44,108
came here for my sake.

510
00:47:47,987 --> 00:47:50,239
I lost my parents and relatives.

511
00:47:52,283 --> 00:47:54,911
Surviving alone once is enough.

512
00:47:57,330 --> 00:47:58,831
I can't run away again…

513
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:04,295
and spend my life as a living corpse.

514
00:48:11,594 --> 00:48:12,803
Tell me.

515
00:48:15,473 --> 00:48:17,850
What is it that you have planned?

516
00:48:24,565 --> 00:48:25,816
Your Majesty.

517
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:29,737
Carry on your path.

518
00:48:34,075 --> 00:48:36,369
I will do what I must.

519
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:21,934
<i>He plans to use</i>

520
00:49:22,017 --> 00:49:25,104
<i>the temporary civil service examination
to appoint Sarim members to office.</i>

521
00:49:25,187 --> 00:49:27,648
Have you no clue
what the Sarim is proclaiming?

522
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:29,566
Removal of honorary positions
and noble titles.

523
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:32,903
Confiscate the slaves
that were bestowed to our lands.

524
00:49:32,987 --> 00:49:36,156
They are out to kill us.
We can't allow them into the court.

525
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,909
Uncle. He only appointed
a couple of civil officials.

526
00:49:38,993 --> 00:49:41,912
I'm upset because
I can see right through his scheme.

527
00:49:48,627 --> 00:49:49,837
Uncle!

528
00:49:50,754 --> 00:49:51,922
Uncle--

529
00:50:05,019 --> 00:50:07,104
The Minister is understandably upset.

530
00:50:07,855 --> 00:50:10,941
His title was handed to him thanks to you.

531
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:14,069
If the Sarim weeds out
unqualified officials,

532
00:50:14,153 --> 00:50:17,156
the Minister of Personnel
will be the first to go.

533
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,325
Are you here to shame me?

534
00:50:24,913 --> 00:50:27,833
You led the dethroning of the King.

535
00:50:27,916 --> 00:50:31,754
Nobody minds your decision
of helping your brother-in-law.

536
00:50:45,267 --> 00:50:47,895
The sword I held that day

537
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:50,355
felt so heavy and burdensome.

538
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:53,275
Whenever I felt like running away,

539
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:55,819
I cast my eyes on your back
that was leading us.

540
00:50:55,903 --> 00:50:59,865
It gave me so much comfort.

541
00:51:03,285 --> 00:51:06,997
I ask you to lead the way again.

542
00:51:08,123 --> 00:51:09,166
Brother.

543
00:51:10,959 --> 00:51:15,255
Did we not swear it to each other
on the day we dethroned the King?

544
00:51:15,339 --> 00:51:20,052
That we would never watch this country
fall to misery in the hands of a tyrant.

545
00:51:20,135 --> 00:51:24,681
To make a rich and powerful country
that will last a thousand years.

546
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:27,684
-That's enough, Councilor.
-When the throne strengthens,

547
00:51:28,268 --> 00:51:30,729
the Queen's family
will be the first to be eliminated.

548
00:51:32,439 --> 00:51:35,442
King Taejong sought help
from his brothers-in-law.

549
00:51:35,526 --> 00:51:36,985
But in order to grow his power,

550
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:39,947
he eliminated them first.

551
00:51:45,327 --> 00:51:49,206
If you also want to avoid
being used by His Majesty…

552
00:51:52,751 --> 00:51:54,837
you need me.

553
00:52:03,846 --> 00:52:04,680
Councilor Park.

554
00:52:07,933 --> 00:52:09,601
My daughter is a Lady.

555
00:52:11,937 --> 00:52:13,814
She is a royal concubine.

556
00:53:09,077 --> 00:53:12,122
I'm afraid your wait will be long.

557
00:53:12,206 --> 00:53:14,917
Lady Cho usually takes a bath
at this hour.

558
00:53:16,251 --> 00:53:18,462
It's my fault for coming unannounced.

559
00:53:19,004 --> 00:53:20,339
Don't worry about it.

560
00:53:34,811 --> 00:53:36,730
I don't see Court Lady Kim.

561
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:39,483
She's recovering from the flogging.

562
00:53:42,027 --> 00:53:45,989
I'm fine, though.
I've gotten used to getting beaten.

563
00:53:56,750 --> 00:54:00,295
Lady Cho won't be back for long.
She asks you to return to your residence.

564
00:54:30,575 --> 00:54:33,161
Our Miss is the only person

565
00:54:33,787 --> 00:54:36,039
who cares for me.

566
00:54:44,965 --> 00:54:45,966
Councilor Park.

567
00:54:46,758 --> 00:54:47,801
Councilor.

568
00:54:48,218 --> 00:54:51,430
His Majesty retracted
his punishment to exile Prince Cheongsan.

569
00:54:51,513 --> 00:54:53,223
He will be on probation instead.

570
00:54:54,516 --> 00:54:57,352
The law forbids royal family members
to interject in state affairs.

571
00:54:58,103 --> 00:55:02,316
This gives the scholars
good reason to protest.

572
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:05,360
Do you plan to mobilize Sungkyunkwan
against the King?

573
00:55:05,944 --> 00:55:07,696
Left Minister.

574
00:55:07,779 --> 00:55:10,198
You said your son
is the <i>jangeui</i> at Sungkyunkwan?

575
00:55:10,282 --> 00:55:11,867
JANGEUI: HEAD SCHOLAR OF SUNGKYUNKWAN

576
00:55:36,975 --> 00:55:38,143
Who sent this letter?

577
00:55:38,226 --> 00:55:39,853
It is from Bamboo Grove Village.

578
00:55:43,815 --> 00:55:46,318
That's enough. You may all leave.

579
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:58,246
<i>A crafter testified</i>

580
00:55:58,705 --> 00:56:01,083
<i>that the man who visited Lady Jeong,
the daughter of Master Lim</i>

581
00:56:01,166 --> 00:56:02,751
<i>was a palace eunuch.</i>

582
00:56:22,562 --> 00:56:25,774
Exiling a royal family member
who committed adultery

583
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:28,193
is the rightful punishment he deserves.

584
00:56:29,111 --> 00:56:31,363
It is unacceptable
that royal members banded together

585
00:56:31,738 --> 00:56:34,908
and intimidated Your Majesty
into lessening the punishment.

586
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:37,661
The royal family
involving themselves in state affairs

587
00:56:37,744 --> 00:56:39,955
when there is no heir apparent

588
00:56:40,038 --> 00:56:42,290
can only be seen as incredible arrogance.

589
00:56:42,374 --> 00:56:46,878
May your Majesty
send the Prince back into exile.

590
00:56:47,462 --> 00:56:50,215
And to rid of the root of the problem,

591
00:56:50,632 --> 00:56:53,468
please grant your royal permission
to select the Queen.

592
00:56:54,052 --> 00:56:55,637
-Please grant your royal permission
-Please grant your royal permission

593
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:58,807
-to select the Queen.
-to select the Queen.

594
00:57:02,144 --> 00:57:03,937
-Please grant your royal permission
-Please grant your royal permission

595
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:06,815
-to select the Queen.
-to select the Queen.

596
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,568
Your Majesty.

597
00:57:09,651 --> 00:57:12,362
The Minister of War
requests permission to see you.

598
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:18,743
I hear the scholars of Sungkyunkwan
have also joined this power struggle.

599
00:57:19,369 --> 00:57:20,328
Yes, Lady Park.

600
00:57:21,496 --> 00:57:25,459
It seems His Majesty has no choice now.

601
00:57:26,293 --> 00:57:27,252
It seems so.

602
00:57:31,339 --> 00:57:34,759
Tell Councilor Park I wish to see him.

603
00:57:37,053 --> 00:57:38,638
I am your servant.

604
00:57:39,639 --> 00:57:41,892
If you wish to fill the court
with members of the Sarim,

605
00:57:41,975 --> 00:57:43,018
I will do as you command.

606
00:57:43,101 --> 00:57:44,728
If you wish to lessen Minister Ou's power,

607
00:57:45,437 --> 00:57:46,938
I will see to it myself.

608
00:57:47,522 --> 00:57:50,066
However,
due to the fickle nature of humans,

609
00:57:50,525 --> 00:57:53,737
they receive happily but oppose greatly
when things are taken away.

610
00:57:54,654 --> 00:57:57,157
Your Majesty. Reveal your intentions

611
00:57:57,866 --> 00:57:59,659
so that I may silence their opposition

612
00:58:00,869 --> 00:58:02,496
and show my loyalty to you more than ever.

613
00:58:04,623 --> 00:58:06,666
What would you like me to do?

614
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:11,004
You have made a promise to me.

615
00:58:14,341 --> 00:58:16,593
Be the grandfather of my eldest son.

616
00:58:17,636 --> 00:58:22,265
It is my wish to father a child
with your daughter.

617
00:58:33,527 --> 00:58:37,155
<i>I plan to save my people in my own way.</i>

618
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:41,034
<i>This will be the only way</i>

619
00:58:41,576 --> 00:58:44,120
<i>to return everything to normal</i>

620
00:58:45,413 --> 00:58:48,667
<i>without the need
to sacrifice innocent lives.</i>

621
00:58:49,417 --> 00:58:50,585
Your Majesty.

622
00:58:50,669 --> 00:58:54,673
Please grant your royal permission
to select the Queen.

623
00:58:55,298 --> 00:58:57,217
-Please grant your royal permission
-Please grant your royal permission

624
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,970
-to select the Queen.
-to select the Queen.

625
00:59:02,556 --> 00:59:04,891
Will His Majesty yield?

626
00:59:05,350 --> 00:59:10,272
Yes, he can't push this matter any longer.

627
00:59:11,356 --> 00:59:14,568
Everything you wish comes to fruition.

628
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:22,158
Does it not make you happy?

629
00:59:24,578 --> 00:59:25,412
Councilor.

630
00:59:28,748 --> 00:59:31,710
Do you remember Scholar Yoo Haksoo?

631
00:59:34,254 --> 00:59:36,423
Back when His Majesty
was the Crown Prince,

632
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:39,384
Scholar Yoo's daughter
was selected as the Crown Princess.

633
00:59:41,928 --> 00:59:44,681
I do not dare to doubt the King
for even a second.

634
00:59:45,307 --> 00:59:48,768
But Councilor Park's cunning ways
and the power of his men

635
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:52,689
have put you in a position
to select Lady Park as the Queen.

636
00:59:52,772 --> 00:59:54,024
I am very much aware of this.

637
00:59:54,608 --> 00:59:56,693
I ask that you hurry…

638
00:59:58,653 --> 01:00:01,031
and consummate with Lady Cho
before this happens.

639
01:00:03,408 --> 01:00:04,618
Your Majesty.

640
01:00:05,285 --> 01:00:06,745
Please set a consummate date.

641
01:00:14,711 --> 01:00:18,673
The daughter of a man revered by the Sarim
was selected as the Crown Princess.

642
01:00:18,757 --> 01:00:21,301
It was only natural
for the officials to be uncomfortable.

643
01:00:21,885 --> 01:00:25,680
That's when Queen Inyoung's
horrible assassination happened.

644
01:00:26,556 --> 01:00:29,768
Scholar Yoo Haksoo was held accountable
and was executed.

645
01:00:30,602 --> 01:00:33,188
A mass expulsion of members
of the Sarim followed.

646
01:00:34,689 --> 01:00:36,524
However, rumor still spreads

647
01:00:36,608 --> 01:00:39,611
among the people
that you are the real culprit.

648
01:00:41,363 --> 01:00:43,740
The whole world knows about this.

649
01:00:45,784 --> 01:00:47,661
What is your reason for bringing this up?

650
01:00:55,627 --> 01:00:57,962
There is something
the world doesn't know about.

651
01:00:59,964 --> 01:01:04,427
It's believed that the future
Crown Princess burned to death.

652
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:08,890
That is not the truth.

653
01:01:12,310 --> 01:01:13,520
His daughter…

654
01:01:15,522 --> 01:01:16,856
is alive.

655
01:01:18,608 --> 01:01:19,734
She survived…

656
01:01:22,112 --> 01:01:24,072
and even entered the palace.

657
01:01:29,494 --> 01:01:31,037
How do you know that,

658
01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:33,832
Lady Park?

659
01:01:38,086 --> 01:01:39,087
I…

660
01:01:42,048 --> 01:01:45,635
am the daughter of Yoo Haksoo.
The late deposed Crown Princess.

661
01:01:49,681 --> 01:01:50,890
I am Lady Yoo.
