00:00:47,258 --> 00:00:50,178
THE PEOPLE, GROUPS, PLACES, AND INCIDENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE PURELY FICTIONAL

3
00:02:25,488 --> 00:02:28,198
Send this traitor to the State Tribunal!

4
00:02:32,078 --> 00:02:33,198
Halt!

5
00:02:36,408 --> 00:02:37,748
Not to the State Tribunal.

6
00:02:40,248 --> 00:02:42,038
Lock him up in the Internal Prison.

7
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:43,878
I will…

8
00:02:46,418 --> 00:02:48,298
hold him responsible in the future.

9
00:02:49,548 --> 00:02:50,758
Yes, Your Highness.

10
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,638
Take him away!

BLOODY HEART
EPISODE 14

12
00:03:14,368 --> 00:03:16,238
The subjects were beheaded?

13
00:03:16,748 --> 00:03:18,658
Councilor Park won't let that happen.

14
00:03:19,288 --> 00:03:20,748
That's what I find even weirder.

15
00:03:20,828 --> 00:03:22,958
Councilor tried to take
the Queen Dowager's life

16
00:03:23,038 --> 00:03:24,878
and was put in the Internal Prison.

17
00:03:26,128 --> 00:03:29,418
Councilor Park can't be that foolish.

18
00:03:30,088 --> 00:03:32,428
But it seems to be true.

19
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:34,598
This is

20
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,178
simply tyranny.

21
00:03:37,848 --> 00:03:39,308
What did the State Council do?

22
00:03:39,888 --> 00:03:42,348
What about the Three Offices,
the Royal Family, and scholars?

23
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:44,398
They used the law, causes,
and honor for parents

24
00:03:44,478 --> 00:03:46,478
to stop me from making any moves.

25
00:03:46,568 --> 00:03:47,938
Why are they silent now?

26
00:03:52,108 --> 00:03:53,318
Your Majesty.

27
00:03:55,078 --> 00:03:57,038
I have another piece of news.

28
00:04:42,328 --> 00:04:43,748
Please don't move.

29
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,128
You should be careful right now.

30
00:04:50,418 --> 00:04:51,968
Have you heard?

31
00:04:52,048 --> 00:04:53,218
I heard…

32
00:04:55,678 --> 00:04:56,928
you are pregnant.

33
00:04:58,468 --> 00:04:59,808
Yes, Your Majesty.

34
00:05:05,398 --> 00:05:06,808
I'm sorry.

35
00:05:06,898 --> 00:05:10,608
I put you through so much trouble
even though you were pregnant.

36
00:05:12,608 --> 00:05:13,948
I won't ever

37
00:05:14,568 --> 00:05:16,568
leave you alone again.

38
00:05:18,448 --> 00:05:19,658
Ttonggeum…

39
00:05:21,078 --> 00:05:22,328
died.

40
00:05:23,578 --> 00:05:25,578
She died in my place

41
00:05:26,168 --> 00:05:28,248
in the hands of those
who tried to kill me.

42
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:33,838
The Queen Dowager is a tyrant.

43
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:35,178
An oppressor.

44
00:05:36,258 --> 00:05:38,508
She cannot continue like this.

45
00:05:38,598 --> 00:05:40,178
It may be dishonoring your mother,

46
00:05:41,388 --> 00:05:45,518
but you must do this
for our people and the Royal Family.

47
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:50,768
You have no time to lose.

48
00:05:50,858 --> 00:05:52,228
If her tyranny is prolonged,

49
00:05:52,648 --> 00:05:55,448
we don't know
how much our people will suffer.

50
00:05:55,528 --> 00:05:57,278
The Queen Dowager must be

51
00:05:58,448 --> 00:05:59,738
deposed as soon as possible.

52
00:06:38,238 --> 00:06:40,158
She annihilated a good number of subjects

53
00:06:40,738 --> 00:06:43,078
without questioning them once.

54
00:06:43,158 --> 00:06:45,288
Even Councilor Park is
locked up in the Internal Prison.

55
00:06:45,868 --> 00:06:48,288
That's the prison
for eunuchs and court ladies.

56
00:06:48,748 --> 00:06:49,708
Turn a blind eye to it,

57
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,668
if you wish to live.

58
00:06:53,588 --> 00:06:55,918
Inspector Park
of the Office of Inspector General.

59
00:06:56,008 --> 00:06:56,838
Please allow me in.

60
00:07:03,098 --> 00:07:04,508
There is a rumor

61
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:07,138
that Councilor Park is
imprisoned in the Internal Prison.

62
00:07:07,228 --> 00:07:08,348
Do you know

63
00:07:09,188 --> 00:07:10,938
anything about this?

64
00:07:19,488 --> 00:07:21,198
Please spare him, Your Highness.

65
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:25,288
My lord does not have
anything to do with this rebellion.

66
00:07:25,368 --> 00:07:26,538
And it is told that

67
00:07:27,498 --> 00:07:29,618
he dared to take your life,

68
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,128
but he's only getting framed.

69
00:07:38,628 --> 00:07:40,338
You're asking me to spare him,

70
00:07:41,838 --> 00:07:43,638
which makes me want to kill him even more.

71
00:07:44,258 --> 00:07:45,388
I shall

72
00:07:46,428 --> 00:07:47,848
cut off my tongue

73
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:51,058
since it dared to defy you.

74
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:53,098
If you ask me for my head,

75
00:07:53,768 --> 00:07:55,398
I will give it to you.

76
00:07:55,978 --> 00:07:58,278
And how shall I use that disgusting thing?

77
00:08:04,988 --> 00:08:06,658
Keep your eyes on everything

78
00:08:06,738 --> 00:08:08,448
with the same vigor
when you humiliated me.

79
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:11,618
Your tongue, your head,

80
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:14,038
and your life as the wife
of the left state councilor.

81
00:08:38,478 --> 00:08:41,188
Mother, let us go.

82
00:08:55,378 --> 00:08:56,628
Go meet your father.

83
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,918
The Internal Prison doesn't allow
private visitors.

84
00:08:58,998 --> 00:09:00,588
I'll find a way for you.

85
00:09:01,338 --> 00:09:04,758
Go ask your father what he's up to.

86
00:09:07,968 --> 00:09:09,008
I will do

87
00:09:10,308 --> 00:09:11,678
as he asks.

88
00:09:19,898 --> 00:09:21,278
TRAITOR

89
00:09:21,358 --> 00:09:23,188
NO KYUNGMOON

90
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:26,908
Announcing that in these current times

91
00:09:28,778 --> 00:09:30,988
is the same as saying that you are.

92
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:40,458
My lord.

93
00:09:41,628 --> 00:09:43,548
I became a bystander of slaughter

94
00:09:44,588 --> 00:09:46,718
although I was in charge
of the palace's security.

95
00:09:47,548 --> 00:09:49,638
I let some hoodlums take the palace.

96
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,428
Did you not find any bodies?

97
00:09:53,518 --> 00:09:56,268
No, they cleaned up everything
after killing the hoodlums.

98
00:09:56,848 --> 00:09:58,148
It's not just a few.

99
00:09:59,148 --> 00:10:01,268
That means the Consort is
likely to have survived.

100
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:04,028
-Should I say I'm relieved?
-My lord.

101
00:10:04,608 --> 00:10:05,488
Please look.

102
00:10:05,568 --> 00:10:07,278
This was found nearby.

103
00:10:10,948 --> 00:10:13,788
This is a wooden tag for a regional army.

104
00:10:14,578 --> 00:10:15,708
Does this mean

105
00:10:16,498 --> 00:10:18,248
regional soldiers are near the palace?

106
00:10:49,988 --> 00:10:52,528
Did I disturb you from your sleep again?

107
00:10:53,198 --> 00:10:56,288
I'll soon find out
if the court ladies are fine.

108
00:10:57,618 --> 00:10:59,748
I told you not to worry about it.

109
00:11:01,668 --> 00:11:02,838
I keep dreaming

110
00:11:04,548 --> 00:11:07,628
about how you spit out blood
and collapsed before me.

111
00:11:10,088 --> 00:11:11,838
And Ttonggeum, right before her death.

112
00:11:14,388 --> 00:11:16,768
I keep telling myself
that I cannot forget about her.

113
00:11:18,228 --> 00:11:19,808
Maybe that's why I keep seeing her.

114
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:23,358
-We'll return to the palace soon.
-Once we return,

115
00:11:23,978 --> 00:11:27,108
I'll find the one
who tried to poison you to death.

116
00:11:30,908 --> 00:11:32,618
The one who tried to hurt you

117
00:11:33,238 --> 00:11:35,028
might be the one behind the Queen Dowager.

118
00:11:35,948 --> 00:11:38,448
This isn't something
she could have done alone.

119
00:11:39,538 --> 00:11:41,038
This is someone

120
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:43,708
who put the country in chaos by using her.

121
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:46,878
I will not forgive this one.

122
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,208
I must have…

123
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:25,998
become weak.

124
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,258
I have more to protect,

125
00:12:29,918 --> 00:12:33,428
and it only makes me
more impatient and scared.

126
00:12:34,468 --> 00:12:36,258
This must be why my late father

127
00:12:38,098 --> 00:12:39,848
also cowered down.

128
00:12:41,308 --> 00:12:42,518
I finally understand

129
00:12:43,848 --> 00:12:44,938
how he felt.

130
00:12:47,188 --> 00:12:48,398
What are you

131
00:12:49,438 --> 00:12:51,068
so afraid of?

132
00:13:13,758 --> 00:13:16,338
I was afraid
I wouldn't be able to protect you.

133
00:13:17,848 --> 00:13:18,888
And now,

134
00:13:19,928 --> 00:13:21,598
I'm afraid I may

135
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:24,598
lose you.

136
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:30,478
I went through two selections

137
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:33,358
to marry a strange man.

138
00:13:34,698 --> 00:13:36,408
And both times, it was with you.

139
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,868
We were meant to be.

140
00:13:41,368 --> 00:13:43,748
We cannot be separated that easily.

141
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:27,958
Were you

142
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,838
really going to kill me?

143
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,298
Your Highness.

144
00:14:36,128 --> 00:14:39,508
I am grieved that
I could not take your life.

145
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:43,678
Just as I dragged down
the old deposed king,

146
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:46,768
I will also drag you down.

147
00:14:46,848 --> 00:14:49,228
A subject who rebels once is
a vassal of merit,

148
00:14:50,648 --> 00:14:52,358
but twice, they are a traitor.

149
00:14:53,358 --> 00:14:55,608
Dragging down the Queen Dowager
whilst in her regency?

150
00:14:55,688 --> 00:14:56,818
That is rebellion.

151
00:14:57,448 --> 00:14:58,528
In that case,

152
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:02,068
I will become a traitor.

153
00:15:05,618 --> 00:15:06,908
You must have forgotten

154
00:15:06,998 --> 00:15:09,288
that you were locked up
trying to murder royalty.

155
00:15:09,788 --> 00:15:12,078
Your crime is enough to have
three generations annihilated.

156
00:15:12,168 --> 00:15:15,248
In that case, you can punish me
according to our customs.

157
00:15:15,338 --> 00:15:16,838
I decide what the customs are!

158
00:15:16,918 --> 00:15:18,758
Nobody…

159
00:15:20,548 --> 00:15:23,178
stands above the customs.

160
00:15:24,718 --> 00:15:27,178
You should step down

161
00:15:28,098 --> 00:15:29,638
before you are dragged down.

162
00:15:32,268 --> 00:15:33,768
What can you do?

163
00:15:35,108 --> 00:15:37,228
Nobody in the Royal Court is on your side.

164
00:15:37,318 --> 00:15:38,898
Even if you die in here,

165
00:15:40,778 --> 00:15:42,868
nobody will step up for you.

166
00:15:43,698 --> 00:15:45,368
Before I die,

167
00:15:48,998 --> 00:15:52,538
I will have you deposed, Your Highness.

168
00:16:00,588 --> 00:16:01,968
Where's Consort Park?

169
00:16:03,888 --> 00:16:06,178
Is she alive or dead?

170
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:08,598
Is somebody hiding her?

171
00:16:09,478 --> 00:16:11,848
Maitreya has not answered.

172
00:16:13,018 --> 00:16:14,518
You must have

173
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,268
lost your power.

174
00:16:19,568 --> 00:16:22,318
And where is my message
of the King's death?

175
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,278
You continuously miss things,

176
00:16:27,488 --> 00:16:30,198
so the chief eunuch had to send someone
to the detached palace.

177
00:16:59,778 --> 00:17:01,488
<i>If a scout is here,</i>

178
00:17:01,568 --> 00:17:03,898
it means the Queen Dowager is
suspicious of me.

179
00:17:03,988 --> 00:17:06,568
Tell Siwol to stop going into the palace.

180
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:09,238
We need someone
to cause trouble with the Queen Dowager.

181
00:17:09,868 --> 00:17:12,328
We cannot do that without Siwol.

182
00:17:12,408 --> 00:17:13,998
It'll take some time,

183
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:16,248
but it's doable.

184
00:17:18,128 --> 00:17:19,248
Kyun.

185
00:17:20,128 --> 00:17:22,048
I saw that kid's face.

186
00:17:23,298 --> 00:17:24,798
If he gets hurt,

187
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:27,138
I'll never be able

188
00:17:28,428 --> 00:17:30,388
to forget that boy's face.

189
00:17:31,678 --> 00:17:33,518
And I only saw him once.

190
00:17:34,348 --> 00:17:36,018
How would you feel?

191
00:17:51,948 --> 00:17:53,578
If you came this far,

192
00:17:53,658 --> 00:17:55,958
the situation must be very dire.

193
00:17:56,038 --> 00:17:57,998
Councilor Park knows about you.

194
00:17:58,668 --> 00:18:00,248
Eunuchs are also keeping an eye on you,

195
00:18:00,838 --> 00:18:02,588
so the chief eunuch is
also suspicious of you.

196
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,758
Everyone whom I planted
in the palace has fled already,

197
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:08,968
so I can't find any details.

198
00:18:11,808 --> 00:18:13,518
So you must leave immediately too.

199
00:18:19,228 --> 00:18:20,268
Father.

200
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,278
I thought

201
00:18:27,198 --> 00:18:28,358
after everything,

202
00:18:31,448 --> 00:18:33,288
you would abandon me.

203
00:18:36,368 --> 00:18:38,038
You have no use to me anymore,

204
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:39,998
so of course, I'll abandon you.

205
00:19:28,088 --> 00:19:31,388
He'll now tell the Queen Dowager
that I am still alive.

206
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:33,968
Your Majesty.

207
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,018
I sent Siwol away.

208
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:39,688
He should be out of the city by now.

209
00:19:43,358 --> 00:19:44,398
Good job.

210
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:14,298
<i>Father, it's me.</i>

211
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,508
<i>I have one last thing to do
before I leave.</i>

212
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,558
<i>Don't worry too much.</i>

213
00:20:21,808 --> 00:20:22,938
<i>You know,</i>

214
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:27,358
<i>I'm glad I have a father</i>

215
00:20:28,148 --> 00:20:29,278
<i>I can say that too.</i>

216
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:34,368
The ones who took Consort Park
dropped that.

217
00:20:39,158 --> 00:20:42,078
If you found the evidence,
you should catch the Consort first.

218
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,208
Why are you so slow?

219
00:20:46,088 --> 00:20:47,338
It's a regional army tag.

220
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:49,338
What?

221
00:20:49,418 --> 00:20:51,048
I do not know which region they are from,

222
00:20:51,128 --> 00:20:52,298
but that position shows

223
00:20:52,378 --> 00:20:55,388
local soldiers under a governor are
near the palace.

224
00:20:56,638 --> 00:21:00,138
We never mobilized
a governor's soldiers, so…

225
00:21:03,308 --> 00:21:04,558
If His Majesty gave an order,

226
00:21:05,728 --> 00:21:07,308
it would've been possible.

227
00:21:07,398 --> 00:21:09,438
Why are you telling me this now?

228
00:21:11,528 --> 00:21:13,648
How dare that disgusting eunuch!

229
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:18,278
Your Highness!

230
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:20,408
Your Highness!

231
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:22,248
Your Highness.

232
00:21:23,578 --> 00:21:24,788
There is bad news.

233
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:26,628
The ones who took Consort Park

234
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:29,378
seem to be local soldiers
working for a governor.

235
00:21:31,258 --> 00:21:33,798
I haven't told any governor
to mobilize his soldiers lately.

236
00:21:33,878 --> 00:21:36,088
Why are they near the palace?

237
00:21:36,178 --> 00:21:37,088
On top of that,

238
00:21:37,678 --> 00:21:39,928
the troop dispatch token is
still within palace walls.

239
00:21:40,808 --> 00:21:42,848
If His Majesty signed the order,

240
00:21:42,928 --> 00:21:44,638
it might be possible.

241
00:21:46,268 --> 00:21:47,348
It looks like

242
00:21:48,188 --> 00:21:49,938
His Majesty has woken up.

243
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:56,358
Hyekang said the King will not live.

244
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:58,068
He can miss everything else,

245
00:21:59,488 --> 00:22:01,658
but he was never wrong about…

246
00:22:15,878 --> 00:22:17,088
the King.

247
00:22:17,888 --> 00:22:20,928
Did you just say that my uncle
is to be sent to Jeolla Province?

248
00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:23,018
You choose to send one of my few relatives

249
00:22:24,018 --> 00:22:25,598
so far away.

250
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,098
His Majesty has

251
00:22:27,188 --> 00:22:29,898
<i>already appointed him
as governor of Jeolla Province.</i>

252
00:22:30,938 --> 00:22:34,818
<i>To honor the skies
before the rain-calling ceremony,</i>

253
00:22:34,898 --> 00:22:37,028
he lowered his food intake
for the past three days.

254
00:22:37,608 --> 00:22:39,988
Since last night,
he did not even drink water.

255
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:41,118
That is true.

256
00:22:41,198 --> 00:22:44,578
Those who serve at his palace
can testify to that.

257
00:22:44,658 --> 00:22:46,118
How peculiar.

258
00:22:46,788 --> 00:22:48,078
<i>He fasted, you say?</i>

259
00:22:48,168 --> 00:22:49,788
<i>Not even the former King did as such.</i>

260
00:22:51,168 --> 00:22:53,498
<i>But yet, he somehow consumed poison.</i>

261
00:22:58,928 --> 00:22:59,798
Stop him.

262
00:23:07,518 --> 00:23:08,518
Your Highness.

263
00:23:08,598 --> 00:23:10,848
I have been away for too long.

264
00:23:26,828 --> 00:23:27,908
Hyekang.

265
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:31,078
Yes, Your Highness.

266
00:23:32,628 --> 00:23:34,958
Is there a possibility
for the King to wake up?

267
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,258
That will not happen.

268
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:41,968
He's already
about to go to the other side.

269
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:46,968
You dare…

270
00:23:48,348 --> 00:23:50,388
deceive me?

271
00:24:01,318 --> 00:24:02,658
Your Highness the Queen Dowager,

272
00:24:02,738 --> 00:24:04,948
His Majesty has woken up.

273
00:24:05,198 --> 00:24:07,448
I saw him walk around
with my own two eyes.

274
00:24:12,328 --> 00:24:13,538
I ask you once again.

275
00:24:16,418 --> 00:24:17,628
Has the King

276
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,878
deceived me?

277
00:24:25,008 --> 00:24:26,598
The King has…

278
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:32,638
deceived me.

279
00:24:45,488 --> 00:24:46,578
The detached palace

280
00:24:48,618 --> 00:24:50,908
is protected by the soldiers

281
00:24:51,868 --> 00:24:54,118
of the governor of Jeolla.

282
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:57,498
I do not know!

283
00:24:58,458 --> 00:24:59,798
All I heard was that

284
00:25:00,628 --> 00:25:02,968
they were mustered by a written order.

285
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:04,838
His Majesty will

286
00:25:04,928 --> 00:25:07,848
send the soldiers
of Jeolla Province before him.

287
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:10,888
And he will

288
00:25:11,848 --> 00:25:13,848
take the palace over.

289
00:25:16,358 --> 00:25:18,858
He sent the troops here
only with a written order?

290
00:25:19,438 --> 00:25:23,358
He's more loyal to the Royal Family,
even at the cost of his life.

291
00:25:23,948 --> 00:25:25,358
What shall you do?

292
00:25:25,448 --> 00:25:27,738
He sent the army here
without the troop dispatch token,

293
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:28,988
so this is treason.

294
00:25:29,578 --> 00:25:30,788
Go to the Office of Seals and Badges.

295
00:25:30,868 --> 00:25:33,748
I have the troop dispatch token
to deploy the local army.

296
00:25:36,078 --> 00:25:39,288
I shall muster
every single soldier of this nation

297
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:42,008
to burn down

298
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,718
the King's detached palace.

299
00:25:50,308 --> 00:25:51,518
Halt.

300
00:25:54,228 --> 00:25:56,598
The troop dispatch token
belongs to the Ministry of Defense.

301
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:59,688
It was only transferred to you
in a state of emergency.

302
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:02,108
But now, the Queen Dowager demands it.

303
00:26:02,188 --> 00:26:03,938
-You must obey her command.
-How dare you.

304
00:26:04,528 --> 00:26:06,698
-Do not speak to Minister Cho like that.
-How dare you!

305
00:26:07,698 --> 00:26:11,118
My order is the Queen Dowager's order.

306
00:26:26,508 --> 00:26:28,468
<i>I have evidence of some traitors</i>

307
00:26:28,548 --> 00:26:30,428
<i>surrounding his detached palace
to plot treason</i>

308
00:26:30,508 --> 00:26:32,968
<i>against the King
while he isn't in his right mind.</i>

309
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:34,518
<i>I send the troop dispatch token.</i>

310
00:26:34,598 --> 00:26:37,848
<i>All governors of Joseon shall
send their soldiers immediately.</i>

311
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,228
Your Majesty.

312
00:26:42,318 --> 00:26:45,068
The Queen Dowager
mustered all soldiers in every province.

313
00:26:57,158 --> 00:27:00,578
She sent the fake token
all around the provinces of Joseon.

314
00:27:01,168 --> 00:27:04,548
The Queen Dowager
finally showed her rebellious motives.

315
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:10,338
Send my order and the real tokens
to the governors around the country

316
00:27:11,258 --> 00:27:12,928
and muster the troops.

317
00:27:13,008 --> 00:27:15,598
Your order is my command.

318
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:43,208
GOVERNOR OF HWANGHAE PROVINCE

319
00:28:07,568 --> 00:28:09,148
Things are just as you predicted.

320
00:28:09,648 --> 00:28:10,818
The Queen Dowager

321
00:28:11,778 --> 00:28:13,528
took the troop dispatch token.

322
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:16,198
I did everything as you said
with the wooden tag

323
00:28:17,198 --> 00:28:18,658
and the troop dispatch token.

324
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:20,828
So tell me now.

325
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:23,378
Has His Majesty

326
00:28:24,168 --> 00:28:25,538
woken up?

327
00:28:27,548 --> 00:28:28,508
Yes.

328
00:28:35,758 --> 00:28:39,468
You don't look too thrilled
about His Majesty's return.

329
00:28:40,228 --> 00:28:42,018
I am in charge of the palace's security,

330
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,688
yet I failed to carry out my duty.

331
00:28:45,688 --> 00:28:47,818
How will I pay for my sin?

332
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:50,148
I am a little afraid.

333
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:54,108
Minister Cho, you should
make a contribution.

334
00:28:55,948 --> 00:28:59,908
But I do not think
you'll have too much time to think.

335
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:04,748
Councilor Park,
what are you scheming in there?

336
00:29:05,998 --> 00:29:10,878
I'm trying to help His Majesty
get what he wants.

337
00:29:12,298 --> 00:29:14,928
Telling the world that

338
00:29:15,008 --> 00:29:17,428
the Queen Dowager is a traitor.

339
00:29:19,348 --> 00:29:22,928
And now, the times will become tough

340
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:27,108
for the Queen Dowager and her subjects.

341
00:29:30,648 --> 00:29:31,688
Inspector Park!

342
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:37,738
Will you really hand in that appeal
to the Queen Dowager?

343
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,238
Please move aside.

344
00:29:40,698 --> 00:29:42,448
Stop being so naive.

345
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:45,538
Even the Left Minister was killed.
What can you do?

346
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:48,128
Your father is
also imprisoned in the Internal Prison.

347
00:29:49,128 --> 00:29:52,918
You are the one who taught me that
the Three Offices must lay down our lives.

348
00:29:53,008 --> 00:29:55,258
If I was only worried about staying alive,

349
00:29:56,508 --> 00:29:59,758
I would also turn in my appeal,
at the risk of my family's annihilation.

350
00:30:00,348 --> 00:30:03,768
Her Highness is making an attempt
to change the system of the Three Offices.

351
00:30:03,848 --> 00:30:05,848
I cannot let her
bring down the Three Offices.

352
00:30:05,938 --> 00:30:08,098
The Three Offices have already fallen.

353
00:30:17,318 --> 00:30:19,318
If the troops of Jeolla's governor
are protecting

354
00:30:19,408 --> 00:30:21,198
the crafters of Bamboo Grove Village,

355
00:30:22,448 --> 00:30:23,698
it must be His Majesty.

356
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:28,328
I'm not sure
how far His Majesty is involved.

357
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:34,208
I'm not sure if the troops in the city are
on the Queen Dowager's order…

358
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:38,388
or His Majesty's.

359
00:30:39,548 --> 00:30:41,008
Which side do you hope they are?

360
00:30:46,518 --> 00:30:47,938
APPEAL

361
00:30:51,818 --> 00:30:54,068
Whether I should consider you
your father's child

362
00:30:54,148 --> 00:30:56,238
or your mother's child…

363
00:30:57,108 --> 00:30:58,658
I was once troubled over it.

364
00:30:58,738 --> 00:31:00,948
Treat me as inspector
of the Office of Inspector General.

365
00:31:01,908 --> 00:31:04,488
Did you think
this appeal would work in any way?

366
00:31:04,578 --> 00:31:06,118
Even if it does not,

367
00:31:06,368 --> 00:31:09,038
my duty is to turn it in again and again,

368
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:10,578
whether it be ten times or twenty.

369
00:31:15,798 --> 00:31:19,088
I'd rather have you beg me
to let your father go.

370
00:31:19,178 --> 00:31:21,718
If he has committed a crime,
he must be punished.

371
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:23,598
That is my father's business.

372
00:31:28,058 --> 00:31:31,058
From the Office of Inspector General
I, Inspector Park Namsang, ask of you.

373
00:31:31,938 --> 00:31:34,318
The tyranny of the Queen Dowager
worsens day by day.

374
00:31:34,568 --> 00:31:36,648
Also, a group of cunning eunuchs is

375
00:31:37,068 --> 00:31:40,908
working with a pagan religion
to even disrupt political affairs.

376
00:31:41,238 --> 00:31:44,408
They assume power, threaten local leaders,

377
00:31:44,488 --> 00:31:47,408
and even extort civilian farmlands
and their women.

378
00:31:48,708 --> 00:31:50,958
All those with common sense
have come together

379
00:31:51,458 --> 00:31:53,128
to denounce the Queen Dowager.

380
00:31:53,208 --> 00:31:55,798
Drag Inspector Park out immediately!

381
00:32:14,728 --> 00:32:16,778
WEST GATE

382
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:26,588
They have committed all these crimes
with the Queen Dowager behind them.

383
00:33:26,888 --> 00:33:29,138
Their crimes must be exposed
in every detail--

384
00:33:30,518 --> 00:33:32,678
Inspector Park, enough!

385
00:33:32,768 --> 00:33:33,808
Your Highness!

386
00:33:35,688 --> 00:33:38,728
His Majesty has come into the city.

387
00:33:44,318 --> 00:33:47,658
How did the King come into the city?

388
00:33:47,738 --> 00:33:51,198
The governor of Gyeonggi is here
along with His Majesty.

389
00:33:52,158 --> 00:33:53,658
Call Minister Cho now.

390
00:33:53,748 --> 00:33:56,078
Tell him to close all gates

391
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:59,288
and not to let anybody in.

392
00:34:10,888 --> 00:34:12,348
Open up the palace gates!

393
00:34:12,928 --> 00:34:14,518
His Majesty has returned!

394
00:35:16,038 --> 00:35:16,998
Drop your swords.

395
00:35:17,078 --> 00:35:18,408
His Majesty commands it.

396
00:35:36,558 --> 00:35:38,348
Tie up all eunuchs.

397
00:35:39,138 --> 00:35:40,808
Make sure the court ladies do not leave.

398
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:42,768
-Yes!
-Yes!

399
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:52,218
Your Majesty.

400
00:36:52,298 --> 00:36:54,218
I'm very glad as your mother

401
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:57,098
to see how healthy you have become.

402
00:36:59,308 --> 00:37:00,598
I heard

403
00:37:01,558 --> 00:37:03,138
you have been troubled because of me.

404
00:37:06,228 --> 00:37:07,358
Mother.

405
00:37:11,148 --> 00:37:12,238
You are…

406
00:37:14,488 --> 00:37:16,448
stepping on the King's road.

407
00:37:18,448 --> 00:37:19,448
In that case,

408
00:37:22,158 --> 00:37:23,618
drag me off it.

409
00:37:25,918 --> 00:37:28,798
Go ahead and dishonor your mother
and provide a good reason

410
00:37:30,048 --> 00:37:31,298
for your political enemies.

411
00:37:34,178 --> 00:37:36,428
If you shed a drop of my blood,

412
00:37:36,508 --> 00:37:38,508
you won't be able to keep your throne.

413
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:41,638
I am still…

414
00:37:44,518 --> 00:37:46,558
your mother.

415
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:02,118
Your Highness,
I am a court lady of the King's Palace.

416
00:38:03,368 --> 00:38:04,248
Put me down.

417
00:38:26,688 --> 00:38:31,438
THIRD INNER GATE

418
00:38:37,408 --> 00:38:39,618
Do you know what happened
to the ladies of Chaeokdang?

419
00:38:59,718 --> 00:39:00,758
Your Highness.

420
00:39:03,098 --> 00:39:05,348
You were all right.

421
00:39:13,108 --> 00:39:16,568
Thank you so much for staying alive.

422
00:39:45,808 --> 00:39:47,598
The King has returned.

423
00:39:49,388 --> 00:39:52,938
What do you hope will happen to me?

424
00:39:53,768 --> 00:39:55,318
After high treason,

425
00:39:56,068 --> 00:39:59,198
the people threw stones
on the wicked woman's body

426
00:39:59,278 --> 00:40:01,108
which became her grave.

427
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:05,328
Then the deposed king died in a hut
without a single ray of sunlight

428
00:40:07,078 --> 00:40:08,658
all alone.

429
00:40:09,828 --> 00:40:13,208
That is only reasonable.

430
00:40:14,588 --> 00:40:15,668
Bad news.

431
00:40:17,088 --> 00:40:19,088
I'm not like the deposed king.

432
00:40:20,258 --> 00:40:21,628
He was a king,

433
00:40:21,718 --> 00:40:22,718
but I am

434
00:40:24,098 --> 00:40:25,348
the Queen Dowager.

435
00:40:38,778 --> 00:40:40,438
The King has deceived me.

436
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:42,908
Did you know about this?

437
00:40:44,988 --> 00:40:45,988
Yes.

438
00:40:47,698 --> 00:40:49,748
If I trusted you more than I had,

439
00:40:52,868 --> 00:40:54,578
would things have changed?

440
00:40:55,918 --> 00:40:57,038
I do not think

441
00:40:58,128 --> 00:41:00,008
things would have been different.

442
00:41:14,598 --> 00:41:16,358
What do you mean?

443
00:41:16,438 --> 00:41:19,358
Even the female physician said
His Majesty cannot wake up anymore.

444
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:21,818
Do you wish for His Majesty to pass away?

445
00:41:21,898 --> 00:41:25,448
No, how could I…

446
00:41:29,578 --> 00:41:30,948
But Father,

447
00:41:32,288 --> 00:41:34,538
I am also scared of myself.

448
00:41:35,828 --> 00:41:39,338
How can I meet His Majesty
with this sinful face?

449
00:41:40,338 --> 00:41:42,468
I couldn't possibly show my face
even in the afterlife.

450
00:41:43,548 --> 00:41:44,628
I shouldn't have

451
00:41:45,888 --> 00:41:47,888
turned in your profile for the selection.

452
00:41:56,938 --> 00:41:57,898
Come out.

453
00:41:58,858 --> 00:42:00,898
His Majesty ordered your release.

454
00:42:16,208 --> 00:42:17,958
Please get dressed properly.

455
00:42:18,918 --> 00:42:20,838
I will run your bath.

456
00:42:26,468 --> 00:42:27,718
Thank you, my lady.

457
00:43:26,568 --> 00:43:27,568
Siwol.

458
00:43:30,448 --> 00:43:32,118
I told you to travel far.

459
00:43:32,908 --> 00:43:34,698
Why are you laying here?

460
00:43:36,788 --> 00:43:38,658
Get up. Let us go home.

461
00:43:42,038 --> 00:43:43,418
Let's go home, Siwol.

462
00:43:49,428 --> 00:43:50,428
Siwol.

463
00:43:51,298 --> 00:43:53,598
Open your eyes, Siwol.

464
00:43:56,138 --> 00:43:57,808
Let's go home.

465
00:43:59,638 --> 00:44:00,688
Siwol.

466
00:44:02,018 --> 00:44:04,478
You can't lie here like this.

467
00:44:16,038 --> 00:44:19,958
So Ttonggeum was buried in that forest?

468
00:44:20,498 --> 00:44:21,498
Yes.

469
00:44:21,578 --> 00:44:24,788
I asked the court ladies whom I trained.

470
00:44:24,878 --> 00:44:27,668
They couldn't take her out of the city.

471
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:31,378
They have done well.

472
00:44:33,758 --> 00:44:36,098
I should be able
to give her a funeral soon.

473
00:44:37,718 --> 00:44:38,808
Thank you.

474
00:44:40,348 --> 00:44:44,398
Thanks to you,
I got to say goodbye to her.

475
00:44:54,068 --> 00:44:56,118
Are they yet to capture Eunuch Heo?

476
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:24,478
How can I

477
00:45:25,558 --> 00:45:27,268
leave the palace?

478
00:45:30,108 --> 00:45:33,148
I no longer have anywhere to hide.

479
00:45:54,758 --> 00:45:56,548
All troops are looking for him.

480
00:45:57,258 --> 00:46:00,598
Eunuch Heo took a noble family's house,
took in a mistress,

481
00:46:01,638 --> 00:46:03,598
and even set other houses on fire,

482
00:46:04,808 --> 00:46:06,478
so they will not lose him.

483
00:46:08,688 --> 00:46:10,898
A court lady saw him
running into the library.

484
00:46:13,278 --> 00:46:16,818
Eunuch Heo must have caught Ttonggeum
in the secret passage.

485
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:20,828
It means he knows
the passage is in the library.

486
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:25,958
He'll hide there and wait
until things become quiet.

487
00:46:29,458 --> 00:46:32,628
He'll be arrested soon.
Please return to your dwelling.

488
00:46:32,708 --> 00:46:33,838
Yes, Your Majesty.

489
00:46:41,638 --> 00:46:43,018
What should I do?

490
00:46:43,848 --> 00:46:45,098
Will you go over yourself?

491
00:46:46,518 --> 00:46:48,018
I cannot let him die…

492
00:46:49,558 --> 00:46:50,858
in peace.

493
00:46:51,978 --> 00:46:53,478
I'll send him over to Siwol

494
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:56,108
as payment for his way to the other side.

495
00:47:09,748 --> 00:47:11,748
<i>Block off all exits of the passage.</i>

496
00:47:22,758 --> 00:47:23,888
I will never

497
00:47:24,928 --> 00:47:27,018
use that passage again.

498
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:30,228
Never.

499
00:47:43,198 --> 00:47:46,078
Excuse me! Open this door!

500
00:47:46,538 --> 00:47:49,538
There is someone inside!

501
00:48:01,588 --> 00:48:03,758
The things that happened
while I was unconscious is

502
00:48:04,468 --> 00:48:06,098
utterly wretched.

503
00:48:07,348 --> 00:48:09,098
Taking the troop dispatch token

504
00:48:09,688 --> 00:48:12,308
and creating a fake one to deceive
the governors all around

505
00:48:13,018 --> 00:48:14,358
is clearly and obviously

506
00:48:15,688 --> 00:48:17,068
a rebellion.

507
00:48:19,858 --> 00:48:21,238
And everything was committed

508
00:48:21,858 --> 00:48:25,238
with my mother as the leader,
although she has no business in politics.

509
00:48:25,658 --> 00:48:28,948
This is a heinous crime
that cannot be forgiven.

510
00:48:29,038 --> 00:48:31,118
Arrest all those
who created the Interrogation Bureau

511
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:32,538
and took part in the rebellion.

512
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:36,168
Even if you are a subject of merit,
according to your crimes,

513
00:48:38,258 --> 00:48:40,088
their honor will be stripped

514
00:48:40,548 --> 00:48:42,798
and the land and slaves they received
will be taken away.

515
00:48:59,068 --> 00:49:00,938
Also, those who contributed greatly

516
00:49:01,028 --> 00:49:03,108
in subduing this rebellion
will be complimented,

517
00:49:05,448 --> 00:49:07,028
and they will also receive an office.

518
00:49:38,818 --> 00:49:41,398
<i>Moon Simhyun is the leader
of the Sarim in Songrim.</i>

519
00:49:41,488 --> 00:49:42,778
How can he be the Left Minister?

520
00:49:42,858 --> 00:49:44,858
What is this shocking appointment?

521
00:49:44,948 --> 00:49:46,528
He might change
the three state councilors too.

522
00:49:46,618 --> 00:49:47,948
Will you let him continue?

523
00:49:56,328 --> 00:49:57,418
Yes.

524
00:49:58,168 --> 00:49:59,548
We should let him.

525
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:02,668
This is our time to put up with this.

526
00:50:03,338 --> 00:50:07,848
His Majesty will continue
with the criminals, create justifications,

527
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:11,138
and take away the order of merit
from all of his subjects.

528
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:13,888
Yes.

529
00:50:15,388 --> 00:50:16,728
We will let him do this.

530
00:50:18,518 --> 00:50:21,728
Why won't you hold
Councilor Park responsible?

531
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:23,528
Is it

532
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:26,068
because of me?

533
00:50:26,658 --> 00:50:27,908
No.

534
00:50:29,118 --> 00:50:31,538
I have enough evidence
that he tried to kill the Queen Dowager.

535
00:50:31,988 --> 00:50:33,948
I can accuse him whenever I must.

536
00:50:34,038 --> 00:50:36,368
I can put it off for a while.

537
00:50:40,628 --> 00:50:41,798
I will use him

538
00:50:43,668 --> 00:50:45,588
as a hunting dog.

539
00:50:55,888 --> 00:50:59,558
Write down the names of the traitors
who rebelled against me

540
00:50:59,648 --> 00:51:01,358
by taking advantage of the Queen Dowager.

541
00:51:02,978 --> 00:51:06,898
Everyone on this list will be eliminated,
even if they are a subject of merit

542
00:51:08,858 --> 00:51:10,568
or a member of the Royal Family.

543
00:51:12,238 --> 00:51:14,998
I'm sure there is someone
who convinced her to do this.

544
00:51:15,498 --> 00:51:18,368
A woman cannot commit
such an atrocious act

545
00:51:19,418 --> 00:51:21,208
all by herself.

546
00:51:22,038 --> 00:51:23,248
Your Majesty.

547
00:51:23,838 --> 00:51:25,668
I wish to speak to you alone.

548
00:51:30,298 --> 00:51:31,178
You may.

549
00:51:45,898 --> 00:51:47,688
Who do you wish to take out?

550
00:51:47,778 --> 00:51:51,158
The late king, my father,
gave merit to the subjects

551
00:51:51,408 --> 00:51:53,578
according to the list the subjects made.

552
00:51:53,908 --> 00:51:55,538
I shall also punish those on the list

553
00:51:56,578 --> 00:51:58,368
according to our customs.

554
00:51:59,368 --> 00:52:01,118
How far do you wish to punish?

555
00:52:03,588 --> 00:52:05,418
I can't finish it
with a slap on the wrist.

556
00:52:07,548 --> 00:52:09,548
After the limbs

557
00:52:10,718 --> 00:52:11,968
come the head.

558
00:52:13,178 --> 00:52:14,098
Your Majesty.

559
00:52:14,178 --> 00:52:16,218
If you wish to lose just the limbs,

560
00:52:17,808 --> 00:52:19,768
bring me the Queen Dowager.

561
00:52:23,268 --> 00:52:25,518
I will treat the Queen Dowager with honor

562
00:52:26,778 --> 00:52:28,238
until the very end.

563
00:52:30,398 --> 00:52:32,408
I cannot dishonor my mother

564
00:52:33,068 --> 00:52:34,948
and give cause to start a rebellion.

565
00:52:36,538 --> 00:52:38,448
So you subjects must step up

566
00:52:39,408 --> 00:52:41,118
and depose my mother.

567
00:52:42,248 --> 00:52:43,288
That is

568
00:52:44,288 --> 00:52:47,048
how you will get to keep

569
00:52:48,508 --> 00:52:50,128
your petty lives.

570
00:53:08,188 --> 00:53:11,188
I, Left State Councilor Park Gyewon,

571
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:14,448
accept His Majesty's order as my command!

572
00:53:18,118 --> 00:53:19,698
I will…

573
00:53:25,458 --> 00:53:28,548
depose the Queen Dowager!

574
00:54:43,498 --> 00:54:46,158
You survived once again,
thanks to your father.

575
00:54:48,748 --> 00:54:49,838
Your luck

576
00:54:50,838 --> 00:54:52,248
will not last long.

577
00:54:53,588 --> 00:54:55,838
Councilor Park's power has fallen.

578
00:54:55,918 --> 00:54:58,088
How can you last any longer?

579
00:54:58,178 --> 00:55:00,638
You caused Ttonggeum's death.

580
00:55:04,178 --> 00:55:06,268
One day,
I will make you pay for her death.

581
00:55:09,188 --> 00:55:10,608
After my installation ceremony,

582
00:55:11,358 --> 00:55:15,898
I will treat you as the Queen does
a concubine and subject.

583
00:55:15,988 --> 00:55:19,238
What have I done wrong?

584
00:55:19,868 --> 00:55:21,488
You're a fake.

585
00:55:21,578 --> 00:55:24,288
You deceived the world
and the Royal Family.

586
00:55:24,788 --> 00:55:28,118
His Majesty may keep the crafters safe,

587
00:55:28,708 --> 00:55:30,038
but that fact won't change.

588
00:55:32,418 --> 00:55:33,588
The crafters are…

589
00:55:35,628 --> 00:55:37,128
kept safe by his Majesty?

590
00:55:37,588 --> 00:55:41,048
My father has kept an eye on them,
so he's well aware of this.

591
00:55:41,928 --> 00:55:44,178
When Eunuch Heo tried to take them in,

592
00:55:44,258 --> 00:55:46,558
the troops of a governor
kept them safe, didn't they?

593
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:51,938
Let's see how long His Majesty will

594
00:55:53,438 --> 00:55:54,688
keep you safe.

595
00:56:10,118 --> 00:56:11,328
<i>How did His Majesty</i>

596
00:56:13,208 --> 00:56:16,168
<i>know the crafters would fall in danger</i>

597
00:56:18,048 --> 00:56:19,418
<i>and kept them safe?</i>

598
00:56:35,688 --> 00:56:37,568
Is His Majesty in bed?

599
00:56:37,648 --> 00:56:39,858
No, he's still in his royal office.

600
00:56:39,948 --> 00:56:42,448
It seems like he will be late,
so please come in.

601
00:56:44,238 --> 00:56:45,408
I will wait here.

602
00:56:45,488 --> 00:56:47,118
He gave me the order

603
00:56:47,198 --> 00:56:49,958
to escort you in immediately
no matter when you come.

604
00:59:16,228 --> 00:59:17,308
Is Consort Park here?

605
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:19,148
She is, Your Majesty.

606
00:59:44,548 --> 00:59:45,628
Consort Park.

607
00:59:50,428 --> 00:59:52,798
There were subjects who did not show up…

608
00:59:55,218 --> 00:59:57,518
during the regency of the Queen Dowager.

609
01:00:02,438 --> 01:00:04,318
Left Minister No Kyungmoon.

610
01:00:06,318 --> 01:00:07,488
Minister of Taxation Park Chanwe.

611
01:00:09,738 --> 01:00:11,528
Left Vice Minister Ko Inhyuk.

612
01:00:13,118 --> 01:00:14,778
Minister of Commerce Im Joyong.

613
01:00:34,428 --> 01:00:35,598
I have seen

614
01:00:37,018 --> 01:00:38,388
this arrangement before.

615
01:00:43,978 --> 01:00:47,938
I saw it before you collapsed.

616
01:00:52,818 --> 01:00:55,868
The one who caused
the regency by the Queen Dowager,

617
01:00:56,988 --> 01:00:59,868
the one who shook this nation
and let it fall in danger was…

618
01:01:05,208 --> 01:01:06,458
you…

619
01:01:08,708 --> 01:01:10,588
and your design?

620
01:01:53,218 --> 01:01:56,218
BLOODY HEART

621
01:02:16,698 --> 01:02:18,198
<i>Ttonggeum has died.</i>

622
01:02:18,278 --> 01:02:20,618
<i>She died because of your scheming.</i>

623
01:02:20,698 --> 01:02:23,998
<i>They are not to be dealt with
by justice and righteousness alone.</i>

624
01:02:24,078 --> 01:02:25,788
<i>Please step down on your own.</i>

625
01:02:25,868 --> 01:02:29,498
<i>His Majesty wishes for your death.</i>

626
01:02:29,588 --> 01:02:31,378
<i>Deposement will not be enough.</i>

627
01:02:31,458 --> 01:02:33,628
<i>She will once again use filial duty
to pressure me.</i>

628
01:02:33,718 --> 01:02:36,338
<i>Will you have her assassinated?</i>

629
01:02:36,428 --> 01:02:38,048
<i>I would have done the same if I were King.</i>

630
01:02:38,138 --> 01:02:40,218
<i>His Majesty and I are very much alike.</i>

631
01:02:40,308 --> 01:02:42,468
<i>His Majesty is nothing like you.</i>

632
01:02:42,558 --> 01:02:44,178
<i>He shall be different.</i>

633
01:02:44,678 --> 01:02:46,768
<i>And so, I will…</i>

634
01:02:46,848 --> 01:02:48,728
keep His Majesty in check.

635
