BLOODY HEART

2
00:00:46,258 --> 00:00:49,178
THE PEOPLE, GROUPS, PLACES, AND INCIDENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE PURELY FICTIONAL

3
00:01:57,998 --> 00:02:01,628
From now on,
we will have tea together every day.

4
00:02:02,378 --> 00:02:05,678
After your lecture,
please come to my chambers.

5
00:02:07,008 --> 00:02:08,388
I slipped poison

6
00:02:09,468 --> 00:02:10,808
in your tea.

7
00:02:13,768 --> 00:02:18,018
No king was ever safe from poisoning.

8
00:02:18,898 --> 00:02:20,858
Until you have grown a tolerance for it,

9
00:02:20,938 --> 00:02:23,568
you will suffer
from stomachaches and fevers.

10
00:02:25,438 --> 00:02:26,358
But hide your symptoms.

11
00:02:27,408 --> 00:02:28,858
The pain will be yours to manage.

12
00:02:30,028 --> 00:02:31,158
The royal physician cannot know.

13
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:34,788
It should neither be
recorded in the infirmary journal.

14
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:52,928
Resent me for this, Crown Prince.

15
00:02:55,638 --> 00:02:56,728
A mother…

16
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:00,768
knowingly giving her son…

17
00:03:02,938 --> 00:03:04,148
poison to consume!

18
00:03:10,238 --> 00:03:11,448
Poison!

19
00:03:15,698 --> 00:03:17,328
You would rather have me…

20
00:03:19,368 --> 00:03:21,458
grow a tolerance to poison
than see me be poisoned.

21
00:03:28,218 --> 00:03:29,298
I will drink it.

22
00:03:30,088 --> 00:03:32,758
So please Mother…

23
00:03:34,098 --> 00:03:35,638
Do not cry.

24
00:03:54,658 --> 00:03:57,198
BLOODY HEART
EPISODE 13

25
00:04:02,918 --> 00:04:04,748
Look into Jung Euikyun.

26
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,498
Yes, my lord.

27
00:04:07,088 --> 00:04:10,128
Do you believe
that he took in the monk as a boy?

28
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:12,838
Coming between the meritorious subjects

29
00:04:13,218 --> 00:04:15,348
is not a scheme able to be conjured
by the Queen Dowager

30
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:18,888
nor a monk.

31
00:05:08,268 --> 00:05:10,688
Were you the one
who controlled the Queen Dowager,

32
00:05:14,488 --> 00:05:16,818
Your Majesty?

33
00:05:37,508 --> 00:05:38,968
I, Ham Changik,
Governor of Jeolla Province,

34
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:41,468
bow before you as summoned.

35
00:05:58,818 --> 00:05:59,948
Why did Consort Park

36
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:02,658
stay behind at the palace?

37
00:06:03,908 --> 00:06:05,038
Was she detained?

38
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,168
An accusation made by a court maid

39
00:06:09,248 --> 00:06:11,748
has the court ladies of Chaeokdang
banned from leaving the palace.

40
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:14,668
It must be why Consort Park
also chose to stay behind.

41
00:06:15,258 --> 00:06:16,178
Is that all?

42
00:06:17,968 --> 00:06:18,838
Yes, Your Majesty.

43
00:06:33,108 --> 00:06:34,568
Let me see your face.

44
00:06:53,878 --> 00:06:55,508
So this is what you look like.

45
00:06:56,508 --> 00:06:57,968
I have wished

46
00:06:59,008 --> 00:07:00,468
to praise you in person.

47
00:07:02,718 --> 00:07:04,848
I will remember you.

48
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:12,818
I am much obliged, Your Majesty.

49
00:07:13,728 --> 00:07:14,568
Your Majesty,

50
00:07:14,648 --> 00:07:16,608
I worry that you are
depleting your energy.

51
00:07:17,358 --> 00:07:18,318
Please rest.

52
00:07:20,448 --> 00:07:21,318
You are dismissed.

53
00:07:32,788 --> 00:07:35,838
It is too dangerous
to meet Siwol in person.

54
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:37,338
Please do not ask to see him again.

55
00:07:38,548 --> 00:07:39,628
Kyun.

56
00:07:39,718 --> 00:07:40,838
Yes, Your Majesty?

57
00:07:41,638 --> 00:07:42,798
Do not…

58
00:07:44,468 --> 00:07:45,758
abandon him.

59
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:49,808
He is my loyal subject
and one of my people.

60
00:07:51,728 --> 00:07:52,768
I refuse to only see him…

61
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:56,568
as a stone on a Go board.

62
00:08:09,248 --> 00:08:11,538
Father, I hope I did not make a mistake.

63
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:15,748
His Majesty is not
as intimidating as I expected.

64
00:08:16,998 --> 00:08:19,208
Why did you not tell him
about Consort Park?

65
00:08:19,668 --> 00:08:21,218
You said that the news

66
00:08:21,298 --> 00:08:23,678
will do no good while he recovers.

67
00:08:24,348 --> 00:08:27,258
I have learned what not to say
from being your son.

68
00:08:29,768 --> 00:08:33,478
Does the Queen Dowager
truly see her as a great threat?

69
00:08:34,688 --> 00:08:36,358
Even I cannot sway her.

70
00:08:36,768 --> 00:08:38,688
When you were out in disguise,

71
00:08:39,488 --> 00:08:41,198
weren't there those
who attacked Consort Park?

72
00:08:41,898 --> 00:08:44,568
Yes, Lady Cho was behind it.

73
00:08:44,738 --> 00:08:46,198
It was by the Queen Dowager's order.

74
00:08:50,618 --> 00:08:52,288
We must bring Consort Park here.

75
00:08:52,828 --> 00:08:54,118
I will relay the message.

76
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:55,788
Off I go, then.

77
00:08:58,418 --> 00:08:59,418
Siwol.

78
00:09:03,088 --> 00:09:04,798
Are you safe?

79
00:09:10,178 --> 00:09:11,768
Do not worry about me, Father.

80
00:09:13,938 --> 00:09:14,938
Off I go.

81
00:09:34,078 --> 00:09:35,868
Things are looking bad.

82
00:09:36,538 --> 00:09:38,668
I will find you a way out.

83
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:42,338
Doing so will be an admission of guilt.

84
00:09:42,418 --> 00:09:45,298
It will not matter if you lose your life.

85
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:47,178
Ttonggeum has been detained.

86
00:09:50,138 --> 00:09:51,218
How long…

87
00:09:52,428 --> 00:09:54,518
do you expect her to keep silent?

88
00:09:56,098 --> 00:09:58,148
You will be accused of high treason

89
00:09:58,228 --> 00:10:00,728
should she tell a lie.

90
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,568
The Queen Dowager has already

91
00:10:03,648 --> 00:10:06,608
banned your court ladies and maids
from leaving the palace.

92
00:10:07,198 --> 00:10:08,568
If you wait any longer,

93
00:10:09,618 --> 00:10:11,488
you might remain trapped here.

94
00:10:29,848 --> 00:10:31,928
Ttonggeum is still not speaking.

95
00:10:32,718 --> 00:10:35,728
So much for the eunuchs
saying that she soon will.

96
00:10:36,558 --> 00:10:37,898
What do I do?

97
00:10:38,188 --> 00:10:41,648
If this continues, I will be arrested
for accusing an innocent.

98
00:10:42,228 --> 00:10:44,228
You framed Consort Park who outranks you,

99
00:10:45,528 --> 00:10:46,818
so the punishment will be severe.

100
00:10:46,898 --> 00:10:48,198
Father!

101
00:10:48,278 --> 00:10:50,118
Did the Queen Dowager have you summon me?

102
00:10:53,448 --> 00:10:56,038
You dug yourself in a hole
knowing that I would dig you out.

103
00:10:56,618 --> 00:10:59,878
After all, what the Queen Dowager covets
is military power within the palace.

104
00:11:02,998 --> 00:11:05,128
Do not involve me

105
00:11:06,008 --> 00:11:07,258
in your frivolous feuds.

106
00:11:17,138 --> 00:11:19,648
If Consort Park lives,
I will lose my life.

107
00:11:19,728 --> 00:11:20,898
Please.

108
00:11:21,398 --> 00:11:23,768
Father, please do not let me die.

109
00:11:24,858 --> 00:11:25,978
Please!

110
00:11:26,398 --> 00:11:28,778
Please save me this once!

111
00:11:30,238 --> 00:11:33,448
Father, please save me this once.

112
00:11:34,738 --> 00:11:36,328
-Father…
-Open the doors.

113
00:11:36,408 --> 00:11:38,498
Please do not let me die.

114
00:11:52,928 --> 00:11:55,258
There are not many options for you,
Minister Cho.

115
00:11:55,928 --> 00:11:57,978
Either become a traitor
along with your daughter,

116
00:11:58,478 --> 00:12:00,978
or eliminate
Councilor Park and Consort Park.

117
00:12:01,058 --> 00:12:02,438
I do not follow.

118
00:12:03,018 --> 00:12:04,308
Who will then manage state affairs

119
00:12:04,898 --> 00:12:06,318
while His Majesty remains incapacitated?

120
00:12:07,028 --> 00:12:08,818
That is not my concern.

121
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:12,818
The Central Army consists
of those loyal to Councilor Park.

122
00:12:13,408 --> 00:12:17,408
Armed patrol officers within the palace
that are only loyal to him

123
00:12:17,998 --> 00:12:20,078
must surely make you just as anxious.

124
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:26,378
Focus on guarding the palace
as you have been.

125
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:29,508
All I need is Councilor Park
and Consort Park to be gone.

126
00:12:56,948 --> 00:12:57,948
Your Majesty.

127
00:13:02,578 --> 00:13:04,538
Your Majesty, are you awake?

128
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,088
I left her

129
00:13:09,378 --> 00:13:11,168
to fend for herself.

130
00:13:14,258 --> 00:13:15,968
Send word to the Queen Dowager's Palace.

131
00:13:16,468 --> 00:13:20,268
I can no longer leave Consort Park
alone in the palace.

132
00:13:20,768 --> 00:13:23,478
Yes, Your Majesty.
I am sure word has been delivered.

133
00:13:45,618 --> 00:13:48,958
May I ask why you have not ordered
the Left State Councilor to resign?

134
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:51,878
He has made it clear
that he will not accept it.

135
00:13:53,008 --> 00:13:53,878
Your Highness,

136
00:13:53,968 --> 00:13:57,178
the meritorious subjects
have been loyal to him for a long time.

137
00:13:57,678 --> 00:13:59,758
If they choose to side
with him once again--

138
00:13:59,848 --> 00:14:02,058
Do you hold resentment
toward Councilor Park?

139
00:14:09,728 --> 00:14:12,188
If not, let this matter rest.

140
00:14:13,568 --> 00:14:14,608
Yes, Your Highness.

141
00:14:15,528 --> 00:14:17,108
When will His Majesty die?

142
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:18,738
Once he does,

143
00:14:18,818 --> 00:14:21,408
the Minister of War will be of no concern.

144
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:26,118
He will succumb to his illness
as is wished by the Maitreya.

145
00:14:41,138 --> 00:14:41,968
Stand down.

146
00:14:54,398 --> 00:14:56,148
Are you afraid of what may come?

147
00:14:56,238 --> 00:14:58,358
To have such armed guards beside you.

148
00:14:59,408 --> 00:15:03,448
Does that wicked monk advise you
to get rid of me?

149
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:09,498
Yes, and so didn't they
start turning their backs to you?

150
00:15:10,168 --> 00:15:12,788
What are you planning to do
after gaining all that power?

151
00:15:13,588 --> 00:15:16,918
What exactly is power to you?

152
00:15:22,218 --> 00:15:24,558
They had the audacity
to decline your summons.

153
00:15:24,638 --> 00:15:26,598
It is why I must meet them in person.

154
00:15:27,178 --> 00:15:29,768
Being in office is what
they have been continuously avoiding.

155
00:15:29,848 --> 00:15:33,648
Stubborn as they are, they will
fight till the death for their beliefs.

156
00:15:35,028 --> 00:15:37,318
But they are the ones who will replace

157
00:15:38,448 --> 00:15:39,818
the current meritorious subjects.

158
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:42,698
They say that the Office of Palace Eunuchs
has gone as far

159
00:15:42,778 --> 00:15:44,328
as to replacing the State Council.

160
00:15:44,908 --> 00:15:47,078
Why would you want
to appear in front of such filth?

161
00:15:47,658 --> 00:15:50,578
We only worry that
you will lose your life in vain.

162
00:15:51,168 --> 00:15:53,208
Ever since scholar Yoo Haksoo
was executed,

163
00:15:53,538 --> 00:15:55,378
I have stayed clear from state affairs.

164
00:15:56,338 --> 00:15:58,588
I also turned a blind eye while
meritorious subjects abused their power.

165
00:15:58,918 --> 00:16:02,178
However, students of the Confucian Academy
have either been executed or imprisoned

166
00:16:02,258 --> 00:16:04,218
while speaking their minds

167
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:05,928
and that I cannot stand idly by.

168
00:16:07,848 --> 00:16:10,978
Do not stop me from a righteous death.

169
00:16:11,308 --> 00:16:12,308
How foolish of you.

170
00:16:31,248 --> 00:16:33,578
You clearly do not realize
when to be proactive

171
00:16:34,418 --> 00:16:35,748
and when to await the right time.

172
00:16:37,048 --> 00:16:39,258
You refused to answer your King's summons.

173
00:16:40,048 --> 00:16:41,758
You turned a blind eye
to political matters

174
00:16:42,758 --> 00:16:45,008
and buried yourself only in books.

175
00:16:45,098 --> 00:16:46,848
Your… Your Majesty!

176
00:17:01,108 --> 00:17:03,068
Stay safe and prepare for what is to come.

177
00:17:03,448 --> 00:17:05,448
Once I remove the traitors
within the palace,

178
00:17:05,778 --> 00:17:07,368
I will appoint members of the Sarim

179
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:11,538
and have them design the world
they have been dreaming of.

180
00:17:13,168 --> 00:17:14,288
I promise you this…

181
00:17:15,288 --> 00:17:16,668
as your King.

182
00:17:20,088 --> 00:17:23,428
I, classics licentiate Moon Simhyun,
bow down to His Majesty.

183
00:17:23,968 --> 00:17:26,258
-We bow down to His Majesty.
-We bow down to His Majesty.

184
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:44,488
Before we join the court,

185
00:17:44,568 --> 00:17:46,528
we wish to know where you stand.

186
00:17:46,618 --> 00:17:47,738
Go ahead.

187
00:17:48,488 --> 00:17:50,198
Do you believe

188
00:17:50,788 --> 00:17:52,828
that Yoo Haksoo was behind
your mother's murder?

189
00:17:58,378 --> 00:17:59,418
No.

190
00:17:59,998 --> 00:18:03,508
Of course I am well aware
of how he was unfairly treated.

191
00:18:05,468 --> 00:18:06,298
Then,

192
00:18:06,968 --> 00:18:10,558
please accept our appeal
regarding his status as a traitor.

193
00:18:11,848 --> 00:18:15,888
For a long time, my friend has been
wrongfully known as a murderer.

194
00:18:16,938 --> 00:18:18,608
If you reinstate his status,

195
00:18:18,688 --> 00:18:20,858
those who support his beliefs

196
00:18:21,398 --> 00:18:23,778
will choose to be loyal to you.

197
00:18:25,028 --> 00:18:26,398
I give you my word.

198
00:18:26,988 --> 00:18:28,028
Someday,

199
00:18:28,868 --> 00:18:30,778
I will reinstate
Yoo Haksoo's noble status.

200
00:19:03,478 --> 00:19:06,738
My lord, when did you
arrive at the office?

201
00:19:10,488 --> 00:19:13,158
How silly of me to have made you worry.

202
00:19:14,328 --> 00:19:16,038
Have you been well?

203
00:19:16,118 --> 00:19:18,458
Yes, Lord Kim. Are you feeling better now?

204
00:19:20,288 --> 00:19:21,498
Without you present,

205
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:24,088
it has been a challenge to gather
the opinions of the Three Offices.

206
00:19:27,508 --> 00:19:30,588
They are many other
pressing matters at hand though.

207
00:19:31,138 --> 00:19:32,888
-Sorry?
-The Queen Dowager has announced

208
00:19:32,968 --> 00:19:35,848
that continued disapproval
from the Three Offices

209
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:38,138
will lead to limitations within

210
00:19:38,388 --> 00:19:40,598
the Office of the Censor General
and the Office of Inspector General.

211
00:19:40,938 --> 00:19:42,148
She will ban us from remonstrating?

212
00:19:42,728 --> 00:19:44,228
Who is she to announce that?

213
00:19:46,648 --> 00:19:48,108
It is why a joint appeal

214
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,568
from the Three Offices
shall never be mentioned again.

215
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:52,738
If we do not,

216
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:55,488
officials of the Three Offices
will be forbidden to speak.

217
00:19:55,578 --> 00:19:59,078
Lord Kim, it is why we must
speak of this wrongful behavior.

218
00:19:59,158 --> 00:20:02,878
Are you not aware that even your father
is being shunned by the court?

219
00:20:06,548 --> 00:20:09,468
The inspector general
and the censor general have agreed.

220
00:20:10,588 --> 00:20:12,968
Now, put this matter to rest.

221
00:20:14,048 --> 00:20:15,098
But Lord Kim…

222
00:21:05,478 --> 00:21:06,608
Ttonggeum…

223
00:21:07,938 --> 00:21:09,648
was born in your home.

224
00:21:12,028 --> 00:21:13,948
You must have grown a soft spot for her.

225
00:21:15,528 --> 00:21:16,738
Her being injured

226
00:21:17,828 --> 00:21:19,828
will only make you feel terrible.

227
00:21:20,828 --> 00:21:23,618
A soft spot for a servant
who is worth less than livestock?

228
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:28,338
Or maybe that only applies to you.

229
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:31,758
She only came to work at the palace

230
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:34,468
so that she could protect you.

231
00:21:36,178 --> 00:21:38,298
If you do not wish to see her get hurt,

232
00:21:38,388 --> 00:21:40,138
confess the truth.

233
00:21:58,988 --> 00:22:00,198
I must see…

234
00:22:02,158 --> 00:22:03,078
the Queen Dowager.

235
00:22:10,088 --> 00:22:11,338
She is at the royal office.

236
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:13,878
Maybe you should find her there.

237
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:25,268
Lady Cho,

238
00:22:25,348 --> 00:22:27,228
you should request Ttonggeum's release.

239
00:22:28,188 --> 00:22:29,228
I…

240
00:22:30,608 --> 00:22:32,188
no longer have a say in the matter.

241
00:22:33,398 --> 00:22:36,988
Eunuch Heo will soon bring back
the people at Bamboo Grove Village.

242
00:22:38,818 --> 00:22:40,238
Even without Ttonggeum's words,

243
00:22:41,488 --> 00:22:42,988
her identity will soon be revealed.

244
00:22:46,158 --> 00:22:48,958
-What did I tell you?
-Goodness.

245
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:50,788
-Look!
-What on earth?

246
00:22:50,878 --> 00:22:52,378
What now?

247
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:55,168
Why are you back here
with these men again?

248
00:22:55,258 --> 00:22:57,678
-What is it this time?
-We have already paid our tributes.

249
00:22:57,758 --> 00:22:58,928
Why must you scare us again?

250
00:22:59,008 --> 00:23:00,138
I am just as baffled.

251
00:23:00,968 --> 00:23:03,428
The order comes from someone of high rank.

252
00:23:03,768 --> 00:23:05,518
-What?
-How high?

253
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:08,018
Will we be taken away again?

254
00:23:08,098 --> 00:23:10,558
I am just as clueless,
so take it up with the village governor.

255
00:23:11,358 --> 00:23:12,978
-Take them away.
-Yes, my lord.

256
00:23:13,478 --> 00:23:15,108
-No!
-I will not go.

257
00:23:15,188 --> 00:23:17,568
Leave her and take me instead.

258
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:18,568
At least tell us why.

259
00:23:20,408 --> 00:23:21,408
Halt!

260
00:23:26,368 --> 00:23:27,828
-But…
-Goodness.

261
00:23:30,328 --> 00:23:31,458
What is this about?

262
00:23:31,538 --> 00:23:32,668
Step aside!

263
00:23:32,748 --> 00:23:34,338
The Governor of Jeolla Province
has spoken.

264
00:23:34,668 --> 00:23:36,338
The Governor of Jeolla Province?

265
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:46,718
Your Highness,

266
00:23:46,808 --> 00:23:48,428
you seem to have lost your way.

267
00:23:52,228 --> 00:23:54,728
I once saved Ttonggeum
when she was discarded with a disease.

268
00:23:56,148 --> 00:23:58,358
After recovering,
she refused to live as a runaway slave

269
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:00,408
and opted to return to her master.

270
00:24:02,318 --> 00:24:03,908
I could not stop her.

271
00:24:04,698 --> 00:24:07,368
This time, I wish not to regret my choice.

272
00:24:09,498 --> 00:24:12,328
I will speak to the Queen Dowager
at the royal office.

273
00:24:13,248 --> 00:24:14,168
You cannot.

274
00:24:15,128 --> 00:24:18,088
A lady of the Internal Court
must not step inside the royal office.

275
00:24:19,168 --> 00:24:21,088
Please think only of your own safety now.

276
00:24:21,678 --> 00:24:23,338
-I cannot.
-Your Highness!

277
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:25,638
You said Ttonggeum
could speak at any moment.

278
00:24:27,388 --> 00:24:30,638
I cannot knowingly let her
withstand excruciating pain.

279
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:35,768
Do not follow me. That is an order.

280
00:25:31,288 --> 00:25:32,118
Your Highness,

281
00:25:32,748 --> 00:25:36,328
Consort Park has requested
an audience at the royal office.

282
00:25:45,548 --> 00:25:48,928
Consort Park wishes
to step inside the royal office?

283
00:25:49,008 --> 00:25:50,928
That is preposterous!

284
00:25:51,018 --> 00:25:52,888
A lady of the Internal Court
in the royal office

285
00:25:52,978 --> 00:25:54,478
is most taboo amongst taboos!

286
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:58,478
Never in history has there been
such an audacious request!

287
00:25:59,438 --> 00:26:01,068
Should I send her away?

288
00:26:02,568 --> 00:26:05,568
Consort Park is smart
and is probably aware of the consequences.

289
00:26:07,778 --> 00:26:09,198
I should hear what she has to say.

290
00:26:11,118 --> 00:26:12,288
Have her enter.

291
00:26:51,408 --> 00:26:53,948
I am curious as to
how pressing this matter is.

292
00:26:54,578 --> 00:26:55,618
Speak.

293
00:26:55,708 --> 00:26:57,248
By your orders,

294
00:26:57,788 --> 00:27:00,628
one of my court maids was taken
by the Office of Palace Eunuchs.

295
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:06,168
It was only to prove your innocence.

296
00:27:06,968 --> 00:27:08,128
To which I am grateful.

297
00:27:09,178 --> 00:27:10,048
However,

298
00:27:10,928 --> 00:27:13,598
it does not fall under the jurisdiction
of the Office of Palace Eunuchs.

299
00:27:15,638 --> 00:27:17,768
This is nothing but a frivolous matter.

300
00:27:17,848 --> 00:27:19,398
That may be,

301
00:27:19,728 --> 00:27:24,148
but this is a direct violation
of the State Tribunal's authority.

302
00:27:30,028 --> 00:27:33,078
You dare intrude on the royal office

303
00:27:34,868 --> 00:27:36,698
just because of a servant?

304
00:27:40,168 --> 00:27:41,328
Remove her!

305
00:27:41,828 --> 00:27:44,708
We will discuss
a rightful punishment for you.

306
00:27:49,298 --> 00:27:50,378
I am…

307
00:27:53,258 --> 00:27:55,678
with child of His Majesty's blood.

308
00:28:06,148 --> 00:28:07,738
Your grandchild.

309
00:28:07,818 --> 00:28:11,158
I am pregnant with His Majesty's child,
Your Highness.

310
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:16,658
If you sympathize with me in any way,

311
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:19,458
please allow me to join His Majesty

312
00:28:21,078 --> 00:28:23,168
at the royal villa
where he currently recuperates.

313
00:28:48,438 --> 00:28:50,698
There is a possibility of a boy…

314
00:28:52,238 --> 00:28:53,448
being born.

315
00:28:54,318 --> 00:28:55,738
Yes, Your Highness.

316
00:29:02,668 --> 00:29:04,578
It is a joyous event
for the entire nation.

317
00:29:07,128 --> 00:29:08,748
I am nothing but proud.

318
00:29:35,528 --> 00:29:38,028
<i>The Central Army consists
of those loyal to Councilor Park.</i>

319
00:29:38,118 --> 00:29:42,158
Armed patrol officers within the palace
that are only loyal to him

320
00:29:43,708 --> 00:29:45,748
must surely make you just as anxious.

321
00:29:52,878 --> 00:29:55,218
<i>Why did the monk have the Queen Dowager</i>

322
00:29:55,298 --> 00:29:57,758
<i>take control of
the troop dispatch token first?</i>

323
00:29:58,388 --> 00:30:00,558
<i>If His Majesty is truly behind it all,</i>

324
00:30:01,058 --> 00:30:03,938
<i>he would not let her take control
of what is needed</i>

325
00:30:04,848 --> 00:30:06,848
<i>to summon the troops
all across the country.</i>

326
00:30:17,198 --> 00:30:19,368
The troop dispatch token
belongs to the Ministry of War.

327
00:30:19,988 --> 00:30:22,078
Anyone who wishes to get his hands on it

328
00:30:22,158 --> 00:30:23,748
shall be dealt with by the law.

329
00:30:23,828 --> 00:30:25,408
That is what you once said.

330
00:30:29,248 --> 00:30:32,838
Yes, and I only wish to see
that you still have it.

331
00:30:37,218 --> 00:30:40,968
I am currently in charge
of the palace security.

332
00:30:41,058 --> 00:30:43,348
Do not do anything
that will have me doubt you.

333
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:45,518
I see that you already do.

334
00:30:45,598 --> 00:30:47,018
You are the one

335
00:30:47,598 --> 00:30:50,058
who keeps me in check
by controlling the Central Army.

336
00:30:50,898 --> 00:30:52,728
Why is it

337
00:30:52,818 --> 00:30:55,858
that they report their schedule to you
before reporting to the Ministry of War?

338
00:30:57,148 --> 00:30:59,988
From this moment on,
those who report to you

339
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:01,828
will be met with military discipline.

340
00:31:02,408 --> 00:31:04,158
Are you siding with the Queen Dowager?

341
00:31:04,868 --> 00:31:05,828
I…

342
00:31:07,918 --> 00:31:09,378
do not side with anyone.

343
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:13,248
Announcing that in these current times

344
00:31:15,168 --> 00:31:17,508
is the same as saying that you are.

345
00:31:18,548 --> 00:31:19,718
Councilor Park.

346
00:31:24,768 --> 00:31:27,638
Lord Cho, Consort Park announced
that she is with child.

347
00:31:53,418 --> 00:31:55,418
Congratulations!

348
00:31:55,498 --> 00:31:57,758
You are truly with child.

349
00:32:04,428 --> 00:32:05,848
I am overjoyed.

350
00:32:06,428 --> 00:32:08,098
And I am honored, Your Highness.

351
00:32:08,678 --> 00:32:11,058
I should grant you a wish
for your tremendous achievement.

352
00:32:14,318 --> 00:32:15,978
In what way though?

353
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:17,188
Then,

354
00:32:18,488 --> 00:32:20,778
please have my court maid released
from the Office of Palace Eunuchs.

355
00:32:22,068 --> 00:32:25,988
To know that she is being tortured
following a groundless claim

356
00:32:26,078 --> 00:32:27,538
has me…

357
00:32:28,828 --> 00:32:30,498
uneasy.

358
00:32:36,248 --> 00:32:38,838
A lady with child
should never be troubled.

359
00:32:40,838 --> 00:32:42,298
I will allow it.

360
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:14,668
Congratulations on your pregnancy.

361
00:33:16,418 --> 00:33:18,798
However, you should have kept it hidden.

362
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:21,378
You very well know why.

363
00:33:21,968 --> 00:33:24,258
Why did you choose to reveal it instead?

364
00:33:24,838 --> 00:33:26,468
It was to save

365
00:33:26,548 --> 00:33:29,638
one of my people
whom she has been torturing.

366
00:33:34,518 --> 00:33:37,148
The Central Army will guard Chaeokdang.

367
00:33:37,728 --> 00:33:38,978
You need not worry.

368
00:33:48,118 --> 00:33:50,538
Once His Majesty returns to the palace,

369
00:33:51,448 --> 00:33:53,288
this fruitless disruption…

370
00:33:55,958 --> 00:33:57,498
will come to an end.

371
00:34:11,268 --> 00:34:12,308
Your Highness.

372
00:34:12,808 --> 00:34:15,058
The Office of Palace Eunuchs
will bring Ttonggeum out.

373
00:34:15,978 --> 00:34:18,058
No. Tell them that we will
get her ourselves.

374
00:34:22,028 --> 00:34:24,068
-Also have a stretcher ready.
-Yes, Your Highness.

375
00:34:24,148 --> 00:34:25,818
Have you notified
the Royal Medical Office?

376
00:34:25,908 --> 00:34:26,778
Yes, Your Highness.

377
00:34:27,448 --> 00:34:28,908
She must be severely injured.

378
00:34:36,288 --> 00:34:37,208
Step aside!

379
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:46,588
Has it not occurred to you
that harming the pregnant consort

380
00:34:46,678 --> 00:34:49,638
will result in all eunuchs
losing their lives?

381
00:34:53,058 --> 00:34:56,138
No one will dare to block your way.

382
00:34:56,688 --> 00:34:57,558
Please enter.

383
00:34:58,768 --> 00:35:00,108
Every one of your actions…

384
00:35:01,188 --> 00:35:03,028
will be remembered.

385
00:35:07,658 --> 00:35:10,118
Please wait out here
while I check on her first.

386
00:35:10,698 --> 00:35:12,618
I advise that you listen to her.

387
00:35:12,698 --> 00:35:15,448
The sight will not be pleasant
for the baby.

388
00:35:16,748 --> 00:35:19,828
Not even I have seen
a girl as relentless as her.

389
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,128
What did you do to her?

390
00:35:22,838 --> 00:35:25,628
She is alive… for now.

391
00:36:26,028 --> 00:36:26,898
Ttonggeum.

392
00:36:45,128 --> 00:36:46,168
Miss.

393
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:48,708
Yes.

394
00:36:50,588 --> 00:36:51,968
Miss…

395
00:36:53,548 --> 00:36:54,888
It must have been terrifying.

396
00:36:58,928 --> 00:37:00,768
It was.

397
00:37:02,688 --> 00:37:03,688
I…

398
00:37:04,728 --> 00:37:06,898
was afraid…

399
00:37:08,528 --> 00:37:12,068
that I might lose my mind and tell lies.

400
00:37:15,738 --> 00:37:17,238
You did not say anything.

401
00:37:22,368 --> 00:37:23,868
Let us get you out of here.

402
00:37:49,898 --> 00:37:51,528
Miss.

403
00:37:52,358 --> 00:37:53,318
Yes?

404
00:37:54,528 --> 00:37:55,568
Can I…

405
00:37:57,318 --> 00:37:58,328
now…

406
00:37:59,278 --> 00:38:00,578
get…

407
00:38:02,078 --> 00:38:03,828
some rest?

408
00:38:09,288 --> 00:38:11,588
Yes.

409
00:38:16,968 --> 00:38:18,008
I wish…

410
00:38:20,508 --> 00:38:21,678
to sleep now.

411
00:39:18,278 --> 00:39:19,488
Miss.

412
00:39:19,988 --> 00:39:21,198
You know,

413
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:25,448
I do not need to be born
as a noble in my next life.

414
00:39:25,618 --> 00:39:26,458
Why not?

415
00:39:26,538 --> 00:39:27,578
Is it not your dream

416
00:39:27,658 --> 00:39:30,328
to enjoy all the white rice and meat soup
you can possibly have?

417
00:39:31,338 --> 00:39:34,918
I would not mind being a servant
or livestock for that matter

418
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:37,258
as long as you are my master.

419
00:39:38,718 --> 00:39:42,598
Living in your shadows
eating whatever you give me

420
00:39:43,308 --> 00:39:45,888
will be a satisfying life.

421
00:39:52,108 --> 00:39:53,358
<i>A happy one too.</i>

422
00:40:05,448 --> 00:40:06,658
Ttonggeum…

423
00:40:39,438 --> 00:40:41,028
If Consort Park is carrying a child,

424
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:43,158
what would that mean
for the Queen Dowager's regency?

425
00:40:43,238 --> 00:40:45,488
It is impossible to predict
what will happen.

426
00:40:47,908 --> 00:40:48,908
Then…

427
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:52,248
what will happen to me, brother?

428
00:40:52,828 --> 00:40:55,208
Your family is behind you, Lady Cho.

429
00:40:57,878 --> 00:41:00,418
I've been informed of Ttonggeum's death.

430
00:41:03,548 --> 00:41:06,888
The lowly rat paid for
how she humiliated me.

431
00:41:08,018 --> 00:41:10,428
I am not responsible, am I?

432
00:41:11,058 --> 00:41:11,888
Right?

433
00:41:24,488 --> 00:41:26,528
I am to step down as regent?

434
00:41:26,618 --> 00:41:27,948
Yes, Your Highness.

435
00:41:28,038 --> 00:41:30,078
It is the right course of action…

436
00:41:30,158 --> 00:41:33,498
to await the child's birth
and then decide on a successor.

437
00:41:33,828 --> 00:41:35,878
Please step down as regent

438
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:38,918
and accept the advice of the royal court.

439
00:41:39,498 --> 00:41:42,298
-Please accept our advice.
-Please accept our advice.

440
00:41:43,088 --> 00:41:44,968
I will keep it in mind.

441
00:41:45,968 --> 00:41:47,428
You are dismissed.

442
00:42:10,448 --> 00:42:13,328
They wish for me
to relinquish power to Consort Park.

443
00:42:13,908 --> 00:42:15,288
It seems as though

444
00:42:16,668 --> 00:42:19,248
I must walk the path
of the great King Sejo.

445
00:42:21,548 --> 00:42:25,088
You once told me the Capital was abundant
with men who will do anything for a price.

446
00:42:25,678 --> 00:42:28,548
Anything and everything, Your Highness.

447
00:42:28,638 --> 00:42:30,098
Bring them in this instant.

448
00:42:30,178 --> 00:42:33,928
Ignore procedure and all justifications.

449
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:38,728
Tonight, Consort Park
and those who wish to serve her…

450
00:42:41,858 --> 00:42:43,818
will be murdered.

451
00:43:11,598 --> 00:43:13,928
It is not like you
to be startled this easily.

452
00:43:16,098 --> 00:43:18,808
Well, of course you are on edge.

453
00:43:19,648 --> 00:43:24,228
Our fate usually depends
on those we serve.

454
00:43:25,278 --> 00:43:28,818
Are you here to offer me a way to live?

455
00:43:30,068 --> 00:43:32,488
This is exactly why I am fond of you.

456
00:43:33,698 --> 00:43:34,748
Once Consort Park dies,

457
00:43:34,828 --> 00:43:37,908
you will be given a chance
to contribute to the cause.

458
00:43:38,918 --> 00:43:41,168
Consort Park who tried to murder the King

459
00:43:41,248 --> 00:43:44,418
took her own life in fear
of her false pregnancy being revealed.

460
00:43:44,498 --> 00:43:45,878
That is all you have to say.

461
00:43:48,928 --> 00:43:50,258
Do not feel bad.

462
00:43:50,338 --> 00:43:52,008
No one acknowledges loyalty anyway.

463
00:43:52,758 --> 00:43:56,848
Never have I seen anyone of rank
care for those that serve them,

464
00:43:56,928 --> 00:43:58,518
so why must we be loyal to them?

465
00:44:06,528 --> 00:44:07,398
That is correct.

466
00:44:07,488 --> 00:44:10,318
No one of rank
has ever been that generous.

467
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:12,658
Can I count on you?

468
00:44:12,738 --> 00:44:14,198
Well,

469
00:44:15,658 --> 00:44:19,328
the court ladies and maids of Chaeokdang
are confined to the palace anyway.

470
00:44:21,788 --> 00:44:22,788
When will it happen?

471
00:44:24,458 --> 00:44:25,548
Tonight.

472
00:44:48,738 --> 00:44:50,488
You need to eat something.

473
00:44:50,568 --> 00:44:52,358
You have been starving all day.

474
00:44:53,318 --> 00:44:54,658
The Queen Dowager…

475
00:44:57,198 --> 00:44:59,788
ordered Ttonggeum's body to be discarded.

476
00:45:01,038 --> 00:45:01,958
Yes, Your Highness.

477
00:45:03,418 --> 00:45:05,708
Court ladies cannot die
within palace walls.

478
00:45:07,088 --> 00:45:08,588
I cannot let this happen.

479
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:13,798
She should be properly buried at least.

480
00:45:39,538 --> 00:45:41,078
Did you do as told?

481
00:45:42,208 --> 00:45:43,998
Yes, Court Lady Choi.

482
00:46:13,858 --> 00:46:14,948
What…

483
00:46:17,488 --> 00:46:18,988
did you slip in my tea?

484
00:46:20,828 --> 00:46:21,788
What…

485
00:46:23,578 --> 00:46:24,748
do you plan on doing?

486
00:46:57,908 --> 00:47:01,528
Today's patrol and night duty will
only be conducted by the Palace Guard.

487
00:47:02,738 --> 00:47:05,158
It is the Queen Dowager's orders. Also…

488
00:47:07,038 --> 00:47:10,458
the Central Army's actions
will be publicized,

489
00:47:11,338 --> 00:47:12,838
and they will be punished.

490
00:47:22,928 --> 00:47:26,638
The Central Army
was chased out of the palace

491
00:47:26,728 --> 00:47:30,108
and the Palace Guards were dispatched
to manage a forest fire.

492
00:47:30,188 --> 00:47:32,478
The palace is empty.

493
00:47:33,778 --> 00:47:34,938
All that is left

494
00:47:35,028 --> 00:47:38,488
is for you to fill out the kill list.

495
00:47:41,868 --> 00:47:45,998
Should Left State Councilor Park Gyewon
be at the top?

496
00:47:52,458 --> 00:47:53,418
Should he?

497
00:47:56,458 --> 00:47:59,258
Left State Councilor Park Gyewon…

498
00:48:10,808 --> 00:48:13,688
There is a carver at Beobrae Temple.

499
00:48:14,148 --> 00:48:16,478
-Did you find him?
-Yes.

500
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:21,158
He recently made an object
for a monk named Hyekang upon request

501
00:48:22,238 --> 00:48:23,908
and it is as you expected.

502
00:48:29,408 --> 00:48:31,038
Ready my horse.

503
00:48:32,328 --> 00:48:34,208
There is someplace I must be.

504
00:48:34,838 --> 00:48:35,918
Yes, my lord.

505
00:48:45,718 --> 00:48:46,928
Amusing, is it not?

506
00:48:47,678 --> 00:48:51,728
The fate of the nobles
who have always looked down on us

507
00:48:52,728 --> 00:48:54,018
lies in my very hands.

508
00:48:54,108 --> 00:48:55,148
KILL LIST

509
00:49:31,308 --> 00:49:33,308
I request an audience with His Majesty.

510
00:49:43,658 --> 00:49:45,818
How could you expect
to speak with His Majesty

511
00:49:46,828 --> 00:49:48,538
when he remains unconscious?

512
00:49:49,038 --> 00:49:51,038
The royal physician
has prohibited anyone from entering,

513
00:49:51,788 --> 00:49:52,828
so please leave.

514
00:49:53,918 --> 00:49:57,838
It was you who raised the monk,
was it not?

515
00:50:01,838 --> 00:50:03,968
Inform my King…

516
00:50:06,548 --> 00:50:08,258
that I wish to speak with him

517
00:50:09,928 --> 00:50:11,138
in private.

518
00:50:17,518 --> 00:50:20,358
-He knows about Siwol?
-Yes, Your Majesty.

519
00:50:27,818 --> 00:50:32,288
The former King
was a feeble monarch and leader.

520
00:50:32,998 --> 00:50:35,958
He was kind and righteous, but indecisive.

521
00:50:36,038 --> 00:50:40,298
He was merciful,
but was never authoritative.

522
00:50:40,878 --> 00:50:44,008
If there had been another member
of the royal family who was more worthy,

523
00:50:44,588 --> 00:50:45,968
I would not

524
00:50:46,968 --> 00:50:49,388
have crowned him as king.

525
00:51:14,538 --> 00:51:17,168
My father had been living happily
with his books as friends.

526
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:20,878
Those who forced him
onto a throne he did not covet

527
00:51:23,298 --> 00:51:24,628
were the so-called meritorious subjects.

528
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:26,798
That is the fate of being born a royal

529
00:51:26,878 --> 00:51:29,428
and the price of benefiting
from being one.

530
00:51:30,388 --> 00:51:33,138
However, the one who disregarded
the weight of his duties

531
00:51:34,348 --> 00:51:35,678
was your father.

532
00:51:36,268 --> 00:51:37,688
Is that why…

533
00:51:39,268 --> 00:51:40,558
you pressured him that harshly?

534
00:51:40,648 --> 00:51:42,068
It was to prevent him

535
00:51:43,018 --> 00:51:45,108
from losing his way as a king.

536
00:51:45,188 --> 00:51:46,948
Do you believe you have that right?

537
00:51:47,028 --> 00:51:49,488
My love for this country

538
00:51:50,068 --> 00:51:53,118
must have bestowed that power within me.

539
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:02,668
To mold both my father and me
into benevolent kings

540
00:52:04,168 --> 00:52:05,508
is the reason you pressured us?

541
00:52:05,878 --> 00:52:07,628
Your beliefs and what you deem ideal

542
00:52:09,218 --> 00:52:10,298
are the reason

543
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:13,138
I did not believe in you.

544
00:52:13,218 --> 00:52:15,468
It were the officials
who pressured me in the name

545
00:52:16,058 --> 00:52:17,308
of filial duty.

546
00:52:17,388 --> 00:52:19,888
And by deceiving your mother,
you have violated

547
00:52:20,728 --> 00:52:22,058
the sacred oath.

548
00:52:22,398 --> 00:52:25,278
You have caused mayhem in the name
of strengthening royal authority.

549
00:52:25,358 --> 00:52:26,438
How are your actions…

550
00:52:28,238 --> 00:52:30,358
any different to those
of the deposed King?

551
00:52:30,448 --> 00:52:31,658
The royal family

552
00:52:33,118 --> 00:52:35,158
was robbed of its authority
by its subjects.

553
00:52:35,868 --> 00:52:37,288
Like you said,

554
00:52:37,868 --> 00:52:40,208
it is about time I regain
the power vested in my blood.

555
00:52:42,668 --> 00:52:44,588
Please put an end to this.

556
00:52:45,998 --> 00:52:47,338
It is already too late.

557
00:52:55,138 --> 00:52:56,388
Your Majesty!

558
00:52:59,428 --> 00:53:01,518
Please return to the palace.

559
00:53:02,478 --> 00:53:05,438
It is still not too late.

560
00:53:26,498 --> 00:53:29,168
Your Majesty, an urgent message
was sent from the palace.

561
00:53:29,258 --> 00:53:32,378
Tonight, an unfortunate incident
will take place.

562
00:53:32,468 --> 00:53:33,548
An unfortunate incident?

563
00:53:34,338 --> 00:53:35,548
What about Consort Park?

564
00:53:35,638 --> 00:53:37,468
What happened to her?

565
00:54:02,828 --> 00:54:04,538
Where is the consort?

566
00:54:19,428 --> 00:54:22,018
I am here to discard
the body of a deceased court maid.

567
00:54:23,018 --> 00:54:24,888
She is from the Queen Dowager's palace.

568
00:54:24,978 --> 00:54:27,688
I was told to discard
the ghastly body immediately.

569
00:54:32,898 --> 00:54:34,738
Wait. Don't look.

570
00:54:34,818 --> 00:54:36,238
She was tortured by
the Office of Palace Eunuchs.

571
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:38,528
Those despicable rats.

572
00:54:40,278 --> 00:54:41,488
Leave with it immediately!

573
00:56:25,258 --> 00:56:26,308
There she is!

574
00:58:11,698 --> 00:58:12,748
Please tell me

575
00:58:14,208 --> 00:58:15,368
this is not a dream.

576
00:58:17,748 --> 00:58:18,748
It is not.

577
00:58:48,948 --> 00:58:50,528
You are awake.

578
00:59:08,178 --> 00:59:11,058
Lord Park, Left Minister No
came by to see you.

579
00:59:11,558 --> 00:59:13,968
Left Minister No came by
at this late hour?

580
00:59:14,058 --> 00:59:15,138
Yes, my lord.

581
00:59:15,228 --> 00:59:18,098
He waited quite a while
but then left for the palace.

582
00:59:18,898 --> 00:59:20,688
He requested that I forward this to you.

583
00:59:36,078 --> 00:59:37,118
<i>Lord Park,</i>

584
00:59:37,418 --> 00:59:41,168
<i>I am headed to the palace
as the Queen Dowager has summoned me.</i>

585
00:59:43,248 --> 00:59:45,588
<i>Although it is disloyal
to ignore a royal command,</i>

586
00:59:46,628 --> 00:59:48,928
<i>for some reason,
my feet wish to stay in place.</i>

587
00:59:49,718 --> 00:59:51,928
<i>However, to know that
you are someplace else</i>

588
00:59:52,558 --> 00:59:54,518
<i>puts me at ease.</i>

589
01:00:02,568 --> 01:00:03,858
KILL LIST

590
01:00:37,218 --> 01:00:38,308
Father!

591
01:00:41,018 --> 01:00:42,398
We have a serious situation.

592
01:01:07,708 --> 01:01:09,918
Have the heads of traitors
displayed outside the West Gate

593
01:01:10,128 --> 01:01:12,508
to warn the officials who come and go.

594
01:01:14,638 --> 01:01:16,468
Your order… is my command.

595
01:01:27,068 --> 01:01:29,188
The stench of blood is everywhere.

596
01:01:30,318 --> 01:01:31,648
How sickening.

597
01:01:32,238 --> 01:01:34,988
I will have your chambers
filled with flowers.

598
01:01:35,068 --> 01:01:36,658
As if a few flowers

599
01:01:38,328 --> 01:01:40,158
are enough to cover the stench.

600
01:02:16,448 --> 01:02:19,078
TRAITOR KO MOONHYUNG
TRAITOR HONG JINHWA

TRAITOR NO KYUNGMOON
