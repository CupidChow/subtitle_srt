BLOODY HEART

2
00:00:06,227 --> 00:00:09,146
THE PEOPLE, GROUPS, PLACES, AND INCIDENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE PURELY FICTIONAL

3
00:00:12,608 --> 00:00:16,195
I wish to comfort you
from your unspoken hardships.

4
00:00:18,364 --> 00:00:19,532
My heart…

5
00:00:20,658 --> 00:00:22,034
beats for you.

6
00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:34,755
I am afraid...

7
00:00:36,882 --> 00:00:38,342
I already have...

8
00:00:41,053 --> 00:00:42,471
one to betroth.

9
00:00:50,187 --> 00:00:52,898
There is something

10
00:00:52,982 --> 00:00:55,109
I had planned for a very long time.

11
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,405
And I need that woman

12
00:01:00,865 --> 00:01:02,867
to carry out that plan.

13
00:01:04,577 --> 00:01:05,745
Are you…

14
00:01:09,999 --> 00:01:11,417
in love with her?

15
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:15,713
That woman is…

16
00:01:19,383 --> 00:01:20,676
the one I need.

17
00:01:24,388 --> 00:01:26,265
No other person is important to me.

18
00:01:32,772 --> 00:01:34,190
Then why?

19
00:01:34,857 --> 00:01:36,734
Why do you come to see me?

20
00:01:37,401 --> 00:01:39,320
Why do you always worry about me?

21
00:01:39,403 --> 00:01:40,279
Why…

22
00:01:41,655 --> 00:01:43,908
do you say you want me to be happy?

23
00:01:46,118 --> 00:01:47,995
I know there must be a reason.

24
00:01:57,004 --> 00:01:59,298
Do you not get mad
after you hear what I said?

25
00:02:00,674 --> 00:02:01,926
Do not follow me.

26
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,555
Please don't be sad anymore

27
00:02:07,807 --> 00:02:09,475
and live a good life.

28
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,629
It has been 15 minutes
since our appointment.

29
00:02:39,338 --> 00:02:41,423
Bring someone in charge immediately!

30
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,719
Please don't be mad.
She'll be here any minute now.

31
00:02:46,053 --> 00:02:47,388
What are you doing?

32
00:02:47,471 --> 00:02:50,558
You should take her
and serve some chrysanthemum tea.

33
00:02:53,936 --> 00:02:54,979
Jung.

34
00:02:56,147 --> 00:02:57,314
Where have you been?

35
00:02:57,398 --> 00:02:58,816
Your customer is here.

36
00:03:01,735 --> 00:03:03,362
Did you forget about the deal today?

37
00:03:05,656 --> 00:03:07,324
What happened to your coat strings?

38
00:03:14,456 --> 00:03:15,666
The scholar is…

39
00:03:18,711 --> 00:03:20,629
already betrothed.

40
00:03:26,343 --> 00:03:28,387
Did you know, Master Lim?

41
00:03:30,306 --> 00:03:31,849
Is that why you stopped me?

42
00:03:34,643 --> 00:03:36,103
Go in by the back door and rest.

43
00:03:37,646 --> 00:03:39,106
You might get harassed.

44
00:03:41,317 --> 00:03:42,776
I'll send the customer away.

45
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:47,990
I'll meet her.

46
00:03:48,574 --> 00:03:50,075
You can't do business right now.

47
00:03:50,951 --> 00:03:55,080
Three to four months of our business
becomes our workshop's annual capital.

48
00:03:56,123 --> 00:03:57,750
The workshop must be well-off

49
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,711
for the villagers to benefit as well.

50
00:04:11,764 --> 00:04:13,807
Jung almost got into an accident.

51
00:04:13,891 --> 00:04:15,559
Find out if she's doing all right.

52
00:04:16,143 --> 00:04:19,355
Your Majesty, the chief eunuch is
starting to get suspicious.

53
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,484
If you'll go around risking yourself,
you should have her as a concubine.

54
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:27,029
The court ladies who took part back then
were all caught up in the coup,

55
00:04:27,112 --> 00:04:29,114
so no one remembers her face.

56
00:04:34,453 --> 00:04:35,788
She met me,

57
00:04:38,707 --> 00:04:40,793
lost her parents,
then became a traitor's daughter.

58
00:04:42,127 --> 00:04:43,420
It was because

59
00:04:44,004 --> 00:04:47,299
I wanted to be with her
and have her as a crown princess.

60
00:04:50,219 --> 00:04:51,929
I cannot repeat the same mistake.

61
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:56,350
Then may I tell her that you won't be
coming to see her again on the 15th?

62
00:05:10,823 --> 00:05:13,367
BLOODY HEART
EPISODE 3

63
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:25,462
Who… are you?

64
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:29,216
Do you know the social class of the man
who had his sword pointed at you?

65
00:05:30,467 --> 00:05:31,302
I do not know.

66
00:05:32,553 --> 00:05:34,847
-You don't know?
-I don't! I--

67
00:05:35,723 --> 00:05:38,267
Who on earth is he?

68
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:41,145
Tell me everything you know

69
00:05:41,854 --> 00:05:43,856
about the woman you tried to abduct.

70
00:05:44,732 --> 00:05:46,900
Her class, family,

71
00:05:47,693 --> 00:05:51,739
and her relationship with that man.

72
00:05:53,073 --> 00:05:54,283
Speak.

73
00:07:38,178 --> 00:07:40,389
Issue the marriage ban
on the capital and Gyeonggi

74
00:07:40,472 --> 00:07:42,266
to select the Queen quickly.

75
00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:44,768
Encourage the Chief of Hanseong
and the local leaders

76
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,020
to turn in the profiles of single women,

77
00:07:47,104 --> 00:07:49,731
but reasonably so, without damaging
the Royal Family's reputation.

78
00:07:50,441 --> 00:07:51,608
What's that?

79
00:07:51,692 --> 00:07:55,028
<i>This is the order of the Queen Dowager,
the leader of the selection.</i>

80
00:07:55,654 --> 00:07:56,738
<i>You must respect this order.</i>

81
00:07:56,822 --> 00:07:58,949
-They're taking the women?
-Let's go.

82
00:07:59,032 --> 00:08:01,493
-What do we do now?
-A marriage ban?

83
00:08:14,423 --> 00:08:17,634
What brings you here, my lord?

84
00:08:20,596 --> 00:08:21,638
It's meat <i>jeon.</i>

85
00:08:24,057 --> 00:08:27,728
If you needed me, you should've called.
I would've run over right away.

86
00:08:27,811 --> 00:08:29,438
This is so precious.

87
00:08:30,647 --> 00:08:32,065
Come by and be a companion for Jung.

88
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:35,736
She said she was annoyed
whenever I talked.

89
00:08:35,819 --> 00:08:38,405
I thought it'd be better
for her to be annoyed than depressed.

90
00:08:40,407 --> 00:08:42,659
Wait, is she's depressed?

91
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,119
Why?

92
00:08:58,383 --> 00:08:59,426
I am afraid...

93
00:09:01,595 --> 00:09:02,930
I already have...

94
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,099
one to betroth.

95
00:09:12,898 --> 00:09:13,815
Miss.

96
00:09:14,441 --> 00:09:15,817
Is it true?

97
00:09:16,151 --> 00:09:18,612
I heard that scholar guy
already has a woman to marry.

98
00:09:18,987 --> 00:09:21,573
That's why I tried to stop you!

99
00:09:21,657 --> 00:09:25,369
I said you can't trust a nobleman, that
he probably has a wife and a mistress.

100
00:09:26,328 --> 00:09:27,412
That's enough.

101
00:09:27,496 --> 00:09:31,291
I'll go pour dung over that jerk's house,
so lead the way.

102
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,668
I was going to do that too.

103
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,171
I wanted to go over and make a scene.

104
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,925
But I don't know where he lives.

105
00:09:41,885 --> 00:09:43,929
-Miss.
-I do not know where he resides

106
00:09:44,471 --> 00:09:46,014
or how old he is.

107
00:09:47,099 --> 00:09:48,892
I did not want to touch a sore spot,

108
00:09:49,518 --> 00:09:51,228
so I was too scared to ask.

109
00:09:51,645 --> 00:09:55,107
You wanted to marry him.
How come you don't know a thing about him?

110
00:09:58,068 --> 00:09:59,820
But his feelings were real.

111
00:10:01,071 --> 00:10:05,075
He came to see me every <i>Dano</i>
and every 15th.

112
00:10:08,912 --> 00:10:10,289
That wasn't a lie.

113
00:10:10,581 --> 00:10:12,708
Why are you trying to defend him?

114
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:15,210
Miss, you'll break my heart to death.

115
00:10:15,294 --> 00:10:17,879
But still, he's someone
who helped me live.

116
00:10:17,963 --> 00:10:18,964
What about me?

117
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,593
My master threw me out
when I caught the epidemic.

118
00:10:22,676 --> 00:10:24,011
You took me in and saved me.

119
00:10:24,094 --> 00:10:27,347
Why are you trying
to break my heart to death?

120
00:10:32,477 --> 00:10:35,147
There, there. Once I meet my lord...

121
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,773
I mean, that scholar jerk,

122
00:10:37,566 --> 00:10:39,526
I'll pour a bucket of dung over him.

123
00:10:40,402 --> 00:10:41,695
I'll do that.

124
00:10:42,613 --> 00:10:43,739
Do you mean it?

125
00:10:46,283 --> 00:10:47,367
I do.

126
00:10:59,755 --> 00:11:01,590
Arrest everyone!

127
00:11:01,673 --> 00:11:03,133
-What?
-Yes, my lord!

128
00:11:15,395 --> 00:11:16,396
My lord!

129
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,939
Why do you do this to us?

130
00:11:18,023 --> 00:11:19,858
Think of everything
Lady Jung has done for us.

131
00:11:19,941 --> 00:11:21,652
That lady is who's about to end our lives.

132
00:11:22,235 --> 00:11:23,320
What has she done?

133
00:11:23,403 --> 00:11:26,073
People way up there in Hanyang
gave out the order!

134
00:11:26,156 --> 00:11:27,199
What do you mean?

135
00:11:28,325 --> 00:11:29,785
Is Lady Jung all right?

136
00:11:30,452 --> 00:11:32,454
-I have no idea.
-Let's go!

137
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,804
Any news from Bamboo Grove Village?

138
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:50,972
They ask for another month.

139
00:11:51,306 --> 00:11:52,391
That's too late.

140
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:57,104
Find out some more
through that man locked up in the shed.

141
00:11:58,855 --> 00:12:00,440
Why are Jinsa Lim and that woman

142
00:12:00,524 --> 00:12:02,651
doing business
despite their class as nobles?

143
00:12:02,734 --> 00:12:06,655
Find out their ancestry, reputation,
and families they're close to.

144
00:12:06,738 --> 00:12:07,739
Also,

145
00:12:08,407 --> 00:12:12,619
find out about that scholar
whom she was to marry.

146
00:12:13,537 --> 00:12:14,496
Yes, my lord.

147
00:12:20,961 --> 00:12:23,171
A noble lady in commerce?

148
00:12:25,632 --> 00:12:26,883
She sure is crude,

149
00:12:29,469 --> 00:12:30,846
but also bold.

150
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:34,266
Please turn in…

151
00:12:36,268 --> 00:12:37,269
my profile.

152
00:12:37,936 --> 00:12:38,937
Yeonhee.

153
00:12:39,521 --> 00:12:43,108
I want to rise
to the highest position as a woman.

154
00:12:43,191 --> 00:12:46,611
I don't want another woman
to be by His Majesty's side.

155
00:12:46,695 --> 00:12:50,407
You fool. Do you have any idea
how frightening the Royal Palace is?

156
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,075
My father is the Minister of War.

157
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:53,702
My uncle is the Minister of Personnel.

158
00:12:53,827 --> 00:12:56,872
On top of that, my mother's family is
affluent with many other ministers.

159
00:12:56,955 --> 00:12:59,040
It's only frightening
for those who are lowly.

160
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:02,169
Who would dare to look down on me, Father?

161
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:04,129
That's true.

162
00:13:04,838 --> 00:13:06,214
Do you know

163
00:13:07,048 --> 00:13:09,760
how His Majesty's mother,
the late Queen Inyoung passed away?

164
00:13:10,886 --> 00:13:12,471
The father of the deposed Crown Princess…

165
00:13:13,555 --> 00:13:15,515
killed her, didn't he?

166
00:13:16,308 --> 00:13:18,185
That's what the world thinks.

167
00:13:20,979 --> 00:13:22,981
That Yoo Haksoo murdered the late King

168
00:13:23,398 --> 00:13:25,317
and tried to enthrone the Crown Prince,

169
00:13:26,109 --> 00:13:28,779
but when he got caught,
he killed Queen Inyoung in case she tells.

170
00:13:29,613 --> 00:13:30,781
Isn't that the truth?

171
00:13:32,616 --> 00:13:34,159
We do not know who did it.

172
00:13:36,369 --> 00:13:39,122
When His Majesty tried to take in
his subjects over the matter,

173
00:13:39,748 --> 00:13:43,043
Councilor Park
quickly created that scapegoat.

174
00:13:43,668 --> 00:13:46,379
And the one who benefited the most was

175
00:13:47,923 --> 00:13:49,174
His Majesty.

176
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,845
His Majesty survived as the Crown Prince

177
00:13:53,929 --> 00:13:55,764
because Councilor Park and the late King

178
00:13:56,473 --> 00:13:58,809
agreed to let go
of the late Queen's murder.

179
00:14:03,355 --> 00:14:04,773
Yeonhee, do you understand?

180
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:07,150
That's what the palace is like.

181
00:14:08,276 --> 00:14:09,986
The Royal Family

182
00:14:10,487 --> 00:14:13,532
even uses the death of their mother
and wife to survive.

183
00:14:22,999 --> 00:14:26,962
Councilor Park's niece will become
the next Queen.

184
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,841
Do not become a laughing stock.

185
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:35,971
If I cannot become the Queen,
I'd rather become a monk.

186
00:14:36,054 --> 00:14:37,055
No.

187
00:14:38,306 --> 00:14:39,975
I'd rather hang myself to death.

188
00:14:42,018 --> 00:14:44,521
That disrespectful girl.
How dare she do this before him?

189
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:47,482
Father, I'll teach her a good lesson.

190
00:15:04,332 --> 00:15:07,669
You suffered from a cut on your body
as you went out in disguise, Your Majesty.

191
00:15:07,752 --> 00:15:09,713
What is this atrocity?

192
00:15:10,422 --> 00:15:12,716
It'll become rowdy if it's known.
Keep your mouths shut.

193
00:15:13,508 --> 00:15:14,593
Yes.

194
00:15:15,176 --> 00:15:16,928
Tell Eunuch Jung to come in.

195
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:25,896
Go inside.

196
00:15:26,688 --> 00:15:30,358
Your Majesty seems to want you
rather often lately.

197
00:15:32,402 --> 00:15:33,737
Yes, Chief Eunuch.

198
00:15:41,202 --> 00:15:43,622
<i>Just keep an eye
over Eunuch Jung for a while.</i>

199
00:15:44,664 --> 00:15:46,625
<i>He'll prove to be useful soon.</i>

200
00:15:55,383 --> 00:15:56,801
What's Minister Cho doing?

201
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,388
He must have shut
the cavalry guard's mouth.

202
00:16:00,722 --> 00:16:02,849
There is no rumor
regarding his daughter and you.

203
00:16:03,558 --> 00:16:04,976
Indeed.

204
00:16:07,479 --> 00:16:10,482
Unlike other royal subjects
who only obey Councilor Park,

205
00:16:10,857 --> 00:16:13,026
Minister Cho managed
to make a group of his own.

206
00:16:15,445 --> 00:16:17,405
This is why I want him even more.

207
00:16:33,922 --> 00:16:35,173
You may go.

208
00:16:35,924 --> 00:16:36,967
Yes.

209
00:16:48,853 --> 00:16:51,022
Why did you call the chief cavalry guard?

210
00:16:51,606 --> 00:16:53,692
To check something
regarding His Majesty's travels.

211
00:16:54,818 --> 00:16:57,112
The chief cavalry guard
is under my orders, lord.

212
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,490
Of course, I know that.

213
00:17:13,962 --> 00:17:15,338
Minister Cho.

214
00:17:18,425 --> 00:17:22,721
It has been a while,
so why don't we have a drink quietly?

215
00:17:28,935 --> 00:17:29,978
Sounds great.

216
00:17:34,691 --> 00:17:36,860
You're what ruins this country.

217
00:17:37,068 --> 00:17:40,071
You dared to profit from pocketing
<i>Myeonggwahak</i> books,

218
00:17:41,364 --> 00:17:43,116
then wasted it away on a <i>gisaeng?</i>

219
00:17:43,908 --> 00:17:47,078
My lord, please spare my life!

220
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:50,582
Yes, I shall let you live.

221
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,293
I'll even cover this up.

222
00:18:00,884 --> 00:18:04,220
Give me the best and worst divinations
for the Queen.

223
00:18:05,013 --> 00:18:06,139
Also,

224
00:18:07,974 --> 00:18:10,727
give me one that should never be chosen.

225
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:33,291
Why did you discipline
a mere instructor yourself?

226
00:18:33,374 --> 00:18:37,295
I'm just afraid I'd miss anything
even as small as a needle's eye.

227
00:18:38,296 --> 00:18:40,507
I've been this anxious.

228
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,010
I'm saying that's why I ended up pressing

229
00:18:44,344 --> 00:18:46,429
the chief of the cavalry guard
under your orders.

230
00:18:47,097 --> 00:18:48,389
It's my mistake.

231
00:18:49,432 --> 00:18:51,351
That's a grandeur way of apologizing.

232
00:18:53,228 --> 00:18:55,563
His Majesty has power over personnel.

233
00:18:55,897 --> 00:18:57,732
With a little bit of power,

234
00:18:58,233 --> 00:19:00,860
he'll be able to use that authority
to strengthen his regal power.

235
00:19:02,195 --> 00:19:03,446
A royal marriage

236
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:07,242
is a great chance
for His Majesty to create more power.

237
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,786
However,

238
00:19:10,495 --> 00:19:12,622
I'm still anxious because
His Majesty has an inch

239
00:19:13,832 --> 00:19:15,291
I am not aware of.

240
00:19:17,377 --> 00:19:19,921
What do you mean, His Majesty's inch?

241
00:19:26,427 --> 00:19:29,097
I'll let you know
after I look into it a little more.

242
00:19:33,977 --> 00:19:37,272
If my family could conceive a prince,

243
00:19:37,814 --> 00:19:39,482
I would rest assured.

244
00:20:37,498 --> 00:20:38,625
Who's this?

245
00:20:50,637 --> 00:20:51,804
It's Minister Cho's servant.

246
00:20:59,771 --> 00:21:01,147
Miss.

247
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,400
-Ttonggeum.
-Miss.

248
00:21:04,484 --> 00:21:05,944
What happened?

249
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:11,449
Well… What's with everyone
who's acquainted with you?

250
00:21:14,369 --> 00:21:15,620
My lord.

251
00:21:18,248 --> 00:21:19,207
Please come in.

252
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:21,334
I'm even more glad to see you in Hanyang.

253
00:21:21,417 --> 00:21:23,586
I wanted to see you to relay a word.

254
00:21:24,629 --> 00:21:27,840
He'll no longer be able to come
on the 15th.

255
00:21:30,969 --> 00:21:32,053
My lord.

256
00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:35,890
You can tell him
to come and say that himself.

257
00:21:37,642 --> 00:21:41,854
Do you realize how dangerous it is
for him to come out just to say that?

258
00:21:45,358 --> 00:21:47,026
He'll no longer come.

259
00:21:50,947 --> 00:21:53,324
What is it that I do not know?

260
00:21:55,827 --> 00:21:57,412
Tell me.

261
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:09,090
Good grief. Don't you dare come again!

262
00:22:09,173 --> 00:22:10,967
I'll pour dung all over you!

263
00:22:21,144 --> 00:22:22,186
Lady Jung.

264
00:22:23,688 --> 00:22:25,106
You have a visitor.

265
00:22:40,413 --> 00:22:42,999
It's your first time
going out in disguise by day, right?

266
00:22:44,167 --> 00:22:45,126
It is.

267
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:49,839
The late King used to go out in the day
for relief from the heat,

268
00:22:49,922 --> 00:22:52,091
even halting lessons
and discussions of state affairs.

269
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:56,346
I wonder why Councilor Park suggested
that I go out in disguise.

270
00:22:57,555 --> 00:23:00,641
People's lives are different
when you see them by day.

271
00:23:02,393 --> 00:23:05,521
The cavalry guard will escort me.
Tell them to get ready.

272
00:23:06,147 --> 00:23:08,900
-Come and take a look.
-These all look great.

273
00:23:09,692 --> 00:23:11,652
I've been seeing you often, Chief.

274
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:13,613
It's an honor.

275
00:23:13,696 --> 00:23:15,656
Did you not tell anybody
about the daughter

276
00:23:16,574 --> 00:23:18,284
of Minster of War?

277
00:23:18,368 --> 00:23:21,496
How could I say a word
about what you do in disguise?

278
00:23:23,998 --> 00:23:26,125
What a loyal subject.

279
00:23:38,554 --> 00:23:41,057
Do we have to buy this at the silk store?

280
00:23:42,725 --> 00:23:43,768
Yes.

281
00:23:44,102 --> 00:23:46,771
But silk doesn't go with that bamboo box.

282
00:23:58,116 --> 00:24:00,660
Is this red silk that you like?

283
00:24:01,661 --> 00:24:02,787
What?

284
00:24:21,347 --> 00:24:22,432
My lord?

285
00:25:23,618 --> 00:25:24,785
Do you know her?

286
00:25:27,788 --> 00:25:30,416
-I do not.
-In that case, I'll stop her.

287
00:26:01,822 --> 00:26:04,742
Aren't you the scholar
from Yeongjong Valley?

288
00:26:06,827 --> 00:26:07,703
No.

289
00:26:09,247 --> 00:26:10,164
Oh my.

290
00:26:10,831 --> 00:26:11,874
I'm sorry.

291
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,565
My lord, try this.

292
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,984
Your wife will love it
if you take it home.

293
00:26:38,067 --> 00:26:39,318
Remove it.

294
00:26:39,402 --> 00:26:41,487
-Don't be like that. Just one bite.
-Hey!

295
00:26:43,322 --> 00:26:45,366
-Oh my. What's going on?
-Hey!

296
00:26:45,449 --> 00:26:47,577
-What's going on?
-Gosh, you're killing me!

297
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,787
Goodness, my lord!

298
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:51,789
You may not spare me your alms,

299
00:26:51,872 --> 00:26:54,041
but there's no need to ruin my livelihood!

300
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:56,210
All of you did this.

301
00:26:56,544 --> 00:26:57,753
Pick up everything.

302
00:27:05,636 --> 00:27:06,846
You as well.

303
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:08,764
Yes, my lord.

304
00:27:56,558 --> 00:27:58,936
Why do you go around
with such dangerous people?

305
00:28:01,271 --> 00:28:02,439
Why are you dressed

306
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:05,192
like this?

307
00:28:06,652 --> 00:28:08,320
I'll explain it to you later.

308
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:10,989
You need to return.

309
00:28:12,866 --> 00:28:13,909
No.

310
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,247
I can't let you go like this.

311
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:25,379
Tell me what's happening.
Only then I can help you.

312
00:28:25,462 --> 00:28:27,089
There's nothing you can do.

313
00:28:28,048 --> 00:28:29,591
I can help.

314
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:41,270
Do not mind my affairs.

315
00:28:52,573 --> 00:28:53,824
I do want to mind it!

316
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:57,578
When I couldn't even cry,

317
00:28:57,661 --> 00:29:00,497
you were the one who cried on my behalf.

318
00:29:00,581 --> 00:29:04,251
When I didn't have the strength to go on,
you told me to live on.

319
00:29:04,334 --> 00:29:05,419
And yet…

320
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:09,423
I'm not to mind your affairs?

321
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:16,555
I shall mind you.

322
00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:17,931
And…

323
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:21,435
I will reach where you are, my lord.

324
00:29:24,313 --> 00:29:26,106
You cannot come.

325
00:29:27,816 --> 00:29:29,234
I can.

326
00:29:29,318 --> 00:29:31,153
I do not want you to!

327
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:38,452
My world is…

328
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,541
a place you can't live in.

329
00:30:45,269 --> 00:30:46,520
Leave.

330
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,873
Leave through the back door

331
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,751
after I leave.

332
00:31:24,474 --> 00:31:26,184
The next time we meet,

333
00:31:29,021 --> 00:31:30,856
I will tell you everything.

334
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:35,068
This is…

335
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,363
a promise.

336
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:06,141
Did His Majesty meet with a woman?

337
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:08,101
Yes.

338
00:32:09,686 --> 00:32:13,273
Did you hear everything he said?

339
00:32:14,524 --> 00:32:15,525
Yes.

340
00:32:20,822 --> 00:32:23,742
Tell me everything,
down to every breath they took.

341
00:32:30,832 --> 00:32:31,917
Your Majesty.

342
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,169
Tell us about the woman you met today.

343
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:36,088
I'll remember her for our next escort.

344
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:39,007
She's Minister Cho's daughter.

345
00:32:42,135 --> 00:32:43,470
Let's return to the palace.

346
00:32:52,312 --> 00:32:54,481
What's taking them so long
to bring the profiles?

347
00:32:55,524 --> 00:32:57,442
The Royal Family's reputation
depends on this.

348
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,612
Chief Eunuch, go rush the Capital Bureau.

349
00:33:02,364 --> 00:33:03,532
Yes, Your Majesty.

350
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:12,416
Were there any new profiles?

351
00:33:14,501 --> 00:33:16,920
She wasn't in it.

352
00:33:23,802 --> 00:33:25,846
Minister Cho must turn it in.

353
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,182
Otherwise,

354
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:34,354
this plan I put together for a long time
will come crashing down.

355
00:33:48,034 --> 00:33:51,371
Your superior has
always told Councilor Park

356
00:33:51,955 --> 00:33:55,292
whom I met and where I went
whenever I go out in disguise.

357
00:33:55,917 --> 00:33:57,127
Isn't that right?

358
00:33:58,712 --> 00:33:59,629
Which makes you all…

359
00:34:00,589 --> 00:34:02,883
Councilor Park's subject, not mine.

360
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:04,885
Your Majesty.

361
00:34:05,719 --> 00:34:06,720
It was a joke.

362
00:34:12,434 --> 00:34:16,271
But this time, my whereabouts
didn't reach Councilor Park's ears.

363
00:34:17,773 --> 00:34:20,108
It's because
I met with Minister Cho's daughter.

364
00:34:20,192 --> 00:34:23,737
Come to think about it,
you're loyal subjects of Minister Cho.

365
00:34:26,281 --> 00:34:28,617
Come tomorrow and the next day,

366
00:34:29,201 --> 00:34:31,912
I'll continue to tell another guard
the same thing.

367
00:34:33,789 --> 00:34:35,081
That they shall

368
00:34:35,999 --> 00:34:38,668
tell Councilor Park that
I met with Minister Cho's daughter.

369
00:34:40,253 --> 00:34:42,130
So you should tell him instead.

370
00:34:42,214 --> 00:34:44,925
The fastest one to tell him is
a subject of mine and Councilor Park,

371
00:34:45,008 --> 00:34:46,551
and he'll be the next chief of guards.

372
00:34:51,681 --> 00:34:52,891
That's an order.

373
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:09,199
Boating is the best entertainment
in times like these.

374
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:12,661
It's a shame.

375
00:35:15,205 --> 00:35:18,542
Your Highness, Councilor Park is here.

376
00:35:28,301 --> 00:35:30,178
Just tell me

377
00:35:30,262 --> 00:35:32,305
and I'll ready a boat whenever you wish.

378
00:35:32,389 --> 00:35:35,684
Many people say I've been splurging
with the privy purse,

379
00:35:36,017 --> 00:35:37,727
so I probably shouldn't.

380
00:35:38,228 --> 00:35:42,607
If the privy purse dries up,
I can fill it up with my private funds.

381
00:35:45,402 --> 00:35:46,945
What brings you here?

382
00:35:47,863 --> 00:35:49,698
Are you here for the selection?

383
00:36:04,754 --> 00:36:08,842
His Majesty harbors affection
for another young lady.

384
00:36:09,593 --> 00:36:10,760
His Majesty?

385
00:36:11,386 --> 00:36:15,640
He's so deep in love that
he hasn't revealed his identity to her.

386
00:36:16,725 --> 00:36:20,520
Will she be an obstacle
in the royal marriage?

387
00:36:20,604 --> 00:36:21,897
No.

388
00:36:22,439 --> 00:36:25,358
He loves her deeply,
but he tries to keep her away.

389
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,068
Why?

390
00:36:27,861 --> 00:36:30,989
There is no woman in Joseon
he cannot have.

391
00:36:33,909 --> 00:36:35,744
He probably wants her to be free

392
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:38,788
because he thinks he should not have her.

393
00:36:39,456 --> 00:36:40,540
That's why it seems

394
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,668
his love is even more profound.

395
00:36:57,098 --> 00:36:59,100
Father!

396
00:37:00,936 --> 00:37:02,771
I told you to stay official
when you're at work.

397
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:05,023
Well, this is an emergency.

398
00:37:15,825 --> 00:37:16,952
Halt!

399
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:22,582
Continue.

400
00:37:22,666 --> 00:37:24,459
We are not done with the interrogation.

401
00:37:27,462 --> 00:37:28,421
Councilor Park!

402
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:31,257
Where did His Majesty go in disguise?

403
00:37:33,051 --> 00:37:34,594
What happened?

404
00:37:35,428 --> 00:37:37,305
His Majesty was injured.

405
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:40,558
What have you done while he was hurt?

406
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,771
Stop it, all of you! Stop right now!

407
00:37:44,854 --> 00:37:45,897
You!

408
00:37:46,523 --> 00:37:48,692
Who did His Majesty meet?

409
00:37:51,152 --> 00:37:53,405
Councilor Park, stop this immediately!

410
00:37:55,198 --> 00:37:56,157
Stop.

411
00:37:59,703 --> 00:38:02,122
His Majesty was injured,

412
00:38:03,248 --> 00:38:05,000
yet no one is taking responsibility.

413
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:09,421
What happened to the discipline
of the cavalry guard?

414
00:38:09,504 --> 00:38:11,423
I will discipline them!

415
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:14,592
There is no need.

416
00:38:15,176 --> 00:38:19,514
I'll put an end to this by dismissing
the chief of the calvary guard.

417
00:38:32,444 --> 00:38:36,322
I'll also forget everything
about His Majesty's travels

418
00:38:36,906 --> 00:38:38,825
with this measure.

419
00:39:14,444 --> 00:39:15,904
Are you leaving now?

420
00:39:17,113 --> 00:39:19,449
Will you stay at the official quarters
in front of the palace

421
00:39:19,574 --> 00:39:21,868
without going home again?

422
00:39:22,869 --> 00:39:24,245
I'm behind on my work,

423
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:26,998
so I have no choice
but to save the time to travel.

424
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:29,459
You're always busy.

425
00:39:30,543 --> 00:39:33,671
Councilor Park,
you've added something to my workload.

426
00:39:34,422 --> 00:39:37,967
I heard you personally punished
the chief of chivalry guard.

427
00:39:38,802 --> 00:39:40,720
The Office of Inspector General
will question you.

428
00:39:46,476 --> 00:39:50,605
You're keeping your eyes on everything
that I do. You must be busy.

429
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:52,440
This is under my jurisdiction.

430
00:39:53,149 --> 00:39:55,610
Don't get
the Office of Special Advisors involved.

431
00:39:56,111 --> 00:39:59,781
I'm very annoyed with the chief scholar.

432
00:40:00,782 --> 00:40:02,450
That's not under my jurisdiction.

433
00:40:13,044 --> 00:40:15,088
Your mother wants to see you.

434
00:40:16,756 --> 00:40:18,466
You should stop by sometime.

435
00:40:20,176 --> 00:40:23,388
Yes, Father. Have a safe trip back home.

436
00:40:36,109 --> 00:40:38,027
Were there any other profiles?

437
00:40:38,111 --> 00:40:40,738
No. Should I put them together
and turn them in?

438
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:43,575
Today is the deadline.

439
00:40:43,658 --> 00:40:46,244
We may receive more,
so let's wait a bit longer.

440
00:41:05,221 --> 00:41:07,849
I dismissed everyone. You may speak now.

441
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:10,435
Your Majesty, you asked me

442
00:41:11,477 --> 00:41:13,521
to become the grandfather of your son.

443
00:41:13,605 --> 00:41:14,522
By that,

444
00:41:15,273 --> 00:41:18,193
did you mean you would choose
my daughter to be the Queen?

445
00:41:19,485 --> 00:41:20,486
You're right.

446
00:41:22,405 --> 00:41:24,032
That I cannot do.

447
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:26,910
I can bet the fate of my family

448
00:41:26,993 --> 00:41:29,037
and put her up to the third screening.

449
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,830
But what will happen after that?

450
00:41:30,914 --> 00:41:33,041
You have no way of switching the lady

451
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:35,960
the Queen Dowager is set on.

452
00:41:36,836 --> 00:41:38,213
This is my marriage.

453
00:41:38,588 --> 00:41:40,840
It won't be easy to turn down my choice.

454
00:41:40,924 --> 00:41:44,135
If you insist on having things your way,
it will be disgracing your parents.

455
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:47,180
The King cannot
hold his parents in disdain.

456
00:41:47,764 --> 00:41:49,599
If I say I have a way

457
00:41:49,682 --> 00:41:52,352
of making your daughter the Queen
without defying the Queen Dowager,

458
00:41:54,229 --> 00:41:55,730
would you believe me?

459
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:58,191
I could not.

460
00:41:59,275 --> 00:42:02,153
The Queen Dowager
and Councilor Park are tightly unified.

461
00:42:02,237 --> 00:42:03,821
Why do you try to win against them?

462
00:42:05,114 --> 00:42:08,993
Three Offices have no chance against them
because all they do is talk and talk!

463
00:42:09,577 --> 00:42:11,621
-I will do it.
-You cannot.

464
00:42:11,704 --> 00:42:14,040
-I will prove myself.
-Please do so!

465
00:42:20,088 --> 00:42:24,300
Right after the Queen died,
the first thing I did…

466
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,054
was meet your daughter.

467
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:31,307
When we met the second time,

468
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:34,394
I meant for you to catch us.

469
00:42:34,477 --> 00:42:37,522
I also made Councilor Park
dismiss the chief cavalry guard.

470
00:42:41,901 --> 00:42:43,152
So now,

471
00:42:44,654 --> 00:42:46,864
the one who made you come here was…

472
00:42:49,242 --> 00:42:50,368
me.

473
00:42:50,451 --> 00:42:53,329
-Your Majesty!
-The toughest part

474
00:42:53,955 --> 00:42:57,458
was making you come here.

475
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:00,795
Now that I'm done with the toughest part,

476
00:43:02,005 --> 00:43:04,007
the rest should be easy.

477
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:12,015
Trust me, who made you come
all the way here…

478
00:43:19,814 --> 00:43:21,607
and take my hand.

479
00:45:36,661 --> 00:45:39,205
I, Minister of War Cho Wonpyo,

480
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,752
will become your loyal subject…

481
00:45:47,088 --> 00:45:48,798
who follows only your heart.

482
00:46:17,868 --> 00:46:20,037
Don't try to rig
the result of <i>Myeonggwahak.</i>

483
00:46:20,454 --> 00:46:23,249
If you do, I'll expose the collusion

484
00:46:23,708 --> 00:46:25,835
between you
and the <i>Myeonggwahak</i> instructor.

485
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,962
Listen, Minister Cho.

486
00:46:30,673 --> 00:46:32,800
Have you always been this foolish?

487
00:46:33,634 --> 00:46:34,760
What can I do?

488
00:46:35,344 --> 00:46:37,179
You started this fight.

489
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:38,597
Also,

490
00:46:39,849 --> 00:46:41,726
I was cornered here.

491
00:46:45,146 --> 00:46:46,439
The one who planned this…

492
00:46:47,815 --> 00:46:49,275
was His Majesty.

493
00:47:00,995 --> 00:47:02,705
The inch that you missed

494
00:47:04,165 --> 00:47:05,458
was a little too big.

495
00:47:43,704 --> 00:47:45,247
Walk 30 steps back.

496
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:47,958
Yes, my lord.

497
00:47:54,465 --> 00:47:56,467
It's been a long time
since I came out for archery,

498
00:47:58,135 --> 00:48:00,137
but you caught me again.

499
00:48:04,433 --> 00:48:05,976
What brings you here?

500
00:48:07,269 --> 00:48:08,354
Your Majesty.

501
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,900
Was there a queen you had in mind?

502
00:48:13,734 --> 00:48:14,860
Or…

503
00:48:14,944 --> 00:48:18,864
did you want a family that would
strengthen your royal authority?

504
00:48:21,033 --> 00:48:22,535
In that case,

505
00:48:23,244 --> 00:48:25,871
you should have announced confidently
that you'll strengthen

506
00:48:26,413 --> 00:48:28,374
your royal authority through marriage.

507
00:48:29,959 --> 00:48:34,296
Why do you behave
like a swindler on the street?

508
00:49:48,245 --> 00:49:52,416
Is it because you're here with me?
I haven't had a hit in a while.

509
00:49:54,293 --> 00:49:56,587
A swindler, you say.

510
00:49:57,963 --> 00:50:00,049
The politics you and your men did.

511
00:50:01,133 --> 00:50:02,635
Isn't that what trickery is?

512
00:50:03,385 --> 00:50:07,097
Do leave trickery and swindling
to your subjects.

513
00:50:07,681 --> 00:50:09,892
You should not take part, Your Majesty.

514
00:50:09,975 --> 00:50:11,560
You are the King.

515
00:50:12,102 --> 00:50:15,814
The King must be generous, wise,

516
00:50:16,649 --> 00:50:18,442
and virtuous.

517
00:50:19,276 --> 00:50:21,070
I'm tired of that, Councilor Park.

518
00:50:22,071 --> 00:50:25,199
Such words only worked on my father.

519
00:50:27,868 --> 00:50:30,329
A family that can
reinforce my royal authority.

520
00:50:30,829 --> 00:50:32,915
Why wouldn't I want that?

521
00:50:32,998 --> 00:50:34,166
A royal marriage is…

522
00:50:35,626 --> 00:50:38,379
a deal I make with the family
that will buy me at the highest price.

523
00:50:41,674 --> 00:50:42,800
Your Majesty.

524
00:50:44,218 --> 00:50:46,303
You must keep your dignity as King.

525
00:50:49,556 --> 00:50:50,557
Councilor Park.

526
00:50:52,309 --> 00:50:54,186
No matter what you do,

527
00:50:55,813 --> 00:50:57,439
this queen selection will not go your way.

528
00:51:00,317 --> 00:51:02,486
Challenge me with any woman you please.

529
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:07,700
I will not hold her in my arms.

530
00:51:08,409 --> 00:51:09,702
I will not see her.

531
00:51:11,578 --> 00:51:13,622
I won't even see her face.

532
00:51:16,292 --> 00:51:17,668
She'll grow old…

533
00:51:19,503 --> 00:51:24,258
and die before she sees
the shadow of her husband in the palace.

534
00:51:25,801 --> 00:51:27,344
Therefore, Councilor Park,

535
00:51:28,345 --> 00:51:31,307
you will never be able to go anywhere
near the power of the next generation.

536
00:51:34,518 --> 00:51:36,270
If you lose that future power,

537
00:51:38,105 --> 00:51:41,942
you already know that
your current power diminishes too, right?

538
00:52:08,093 --> 00:52:10,095
-Move them quickly.
-Yes!

539
00:52:10,179 --> 00:52:12,014
Come on, treat them with care.

540
00:52:12,097 --> 00:52:15,142
-One second.
-You're going to ruin this.

541
00:52:15,601 --> 00:52:17,519
Everyone, be careful.

542
00:52:18,437 --> 00:52:19,563
-Ma.
-Yes?

543
00:52:19,646 --> 00:52:22,191
-Make sure you load them nicely.
-Yes.

544
00:52:23,609 --> 00:52:25,235
Something doesn't feel right.

545
00:52:25,319 --> 00:52:28,197
They paid in advance
before they even saw the boxes.

546
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,282
On top of that, they only want you and me.

547
00:52:30,366 --> 00:52:33,494
It's not like you're going alone.
I'll be there too. What's wrong?

548
00:52:33,577 --> 00:52:35,412
-But still.
-Goodness.

549
00:52:35,496 --> 00:52:39,500
I know you're trying to make an excuse
to stay in Hayang longer.

550
00:52:42,252 --> 00:52:45,214
We're leaving on the day
we're done selling the boxes.

551
00:52:45,297 --> 00:52:46,382
That's that.

552
00:52:54,223 --> 00:52:55,557
Miss!

553
00:52:55,641 --> 00:52:56,683
I…

554
00:52:57,601 --> 00:53:00,062
Why is she in such a hurry?

555
00:53:00,687 --> 00:53:02,648
Did she seal a huge deal?

556
00:53:08,529 --> 00:53:12,241
Wait, where have I seen that man?

557
00:53:14,326 --> 00:53:15,452
Uncle Ma.

558
00:53:15,536 --> 00:53:17,287
-Yes? Is it you, Ttonggeum?
-Yes.

559
00:53:17,371 --> 00:53:19,665
-Lady Jung just left.
-Exactly.

560
00:53:19,748 --> 00:53:22,167
Where is she going with Master Lim?

561
00:53:23,127 --> 00:53:25,337
That family must be filthy rich.

562
00:53:26,046 --> 00:53:30,134
Man, people say even servants act
like noblemen in a minister's home,

563
00:53:30,551 --> 00:53:33,554
and their servant were willing to give us
silver coins as payment upfront.

564
00:53:33,637 --> 00:53:35,305
-My goodness.
-Really?

565
00:53:35,639 --> 00:53:38,684
-Is Hyang not here yet?
-She's not here.

566
00:53:38,767 --> 00:53:42,396
Gosh, we were going to meet here.
She's always late.

567
00:53:42,479 --> 00:53:44,022
-Right!
-What is it?

568
00:53:45,065 --> 00:53:47,025
I saw that servant in that house.

569
00:53:47,443 --> 00:53:49,736
-What?
-The servant just now.

570
00:53:50,195 --> 00:53:51,280
Wait, Ma!

571
00:54:00,497 --> 00:54:02,958
What brings you to Hanyang?

572
00:54:03,834 --> 00:54:07,212
Where are Master Lim and Lady Jung?

573
00:54:25,772 --> 00:54:26,815
Jung.

574
00:54:28,317 --> 00:54:29,318
This is…

575
00:54:31,153 --> 00:54:32,196
Yes.

576
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,365
It's the Left State Councilor's home.

577
00:55:05,687 --> 00:55:08,232
-Master Lim, Lady Jung!
-Master Lim, Lady Jung.

578
00:55:08,607 --> 00:55:09,650
Oh no.

579
00:55:13,362 --> 00:55:14,446
Wait!

580
00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:19,618
Lady Jung! Master Lim!

581
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:34,109
-Wait, this is…
-Hyang.

582
00:56:34,192 --> 00:56:36,403
-Hyang, wake up.
-Hyang.

583
00:56:36,486 --> 00:56:37,821
-Wake up.
-Hyang.

584
00:56:38,488 --> 00:56:40,282
-Wake up.
-Come to yourself!

585
00:56:40,365 --> 00:56:41,450
Get them.

586
00:56:42,034 --> 00:56:44,286
These thieves
dared to steal from a noble family.

587
00:56:46,204 --> 00:56:47,289
What?

588
00:57:02,721 --> 00:57:05,265
Drop your head. Councilor Park is here.

589
00:57:09,227 --> 00:57:12,189
<i>Why is the councilor
concerned with petty theft?</i>

590
00:57:13,607 --> 00:57:15,651
<i>Does he know about you?</i>

591
00:57:16,234 --> 00:57:18,737
<i>If he knew,
he wouldn't frame us as thieves.</i>

592
00:57:21,239 --> 00:57:22,991
<i>He wants something else.</i>

593
00:57:24,076 --> 00:57:27,162
These merchants stole from us
by working with our servant girl.

594
00:57:27,746 --> 00:57:28,747
We are being framed.

595
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:30,832
How can we steal from a house
we've never been to?

596
00:57:31,583 --> 00:57:33,335
Do you have any evidence?

597
00:57:33,418 --> 00:57:34,878
The servant girl already told us.

598
00:57:42,636 --> 00:57:44,596
If you truly think we're thieves,

599
00:57:44,763 --> 00:57:47,641
hand us over to the Police Bureau
and let the law punish us.

600
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:50,686
You are a scholar with spirit.

601
00:57:51,269 --> 00:57:53,355
You're a man who should be
working for the people.

602
00:57:54,398 --> 00:57:56,983
How can you punish a person in private?

603
00:57:57,609 --> 00:58:01,488
No matter how affluent you are,
this is unacceptable.

604
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:04,825
Working for the people?

605
00:58:05,909 --> 00:58:08,203
We seem to have different interpretations.

606
00:58:09,871 --> 00:58:13,542
The people can live
only when the state is strong.

607
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:16,503
Therefore, everything we do
for the state is…

608
00:58:17,629 --> 00:58:19,047
righteous.

609
00:58:21,967 --> 00:58:23,218
Songbaek.

610
00:58:27,389 --> 00:58:28,515
Master Lim.

611
00:58:30,642 --> 00:58:32,352
After giving him ten slashes,

612
00:58:35,522 --> 00:58:36,732
kill him.

613
00:58:37,733 --> 00:58:38,859
My lord.

614
00:58:39,985 --> 00:58:44,072
If you have an order for fools like us,
please tell us so.

615
00:58:51,788 --> 00:58:54,291
Why did you think I have an order for you?

616
00:58:55,083 --> 00:58:56,293
Otherwise,

617
00:58:57,085 --> 00:59:01,047
you wouldn't show yourself
before some petty thieves.

618
00:59:09,639 --> 00:59:11,349
You are clever.

619
00:59:14,770 --> 00:59:16,354
You are very clever.

620
00:59:41,421 --> 00:59:43,006
I will assist her in the bath.

621
00:59:43,757 --> 00:59:46,051
You can't do this yourself, my lady.

622
00:59:46,968 --> 00:59:48,428
Tell everyone to leave.

623
00:59:48,512 --> 00:59:50,138
Do not let anyone come nearby.

624
00:59:50,847 --> 00:59:52,057
Yes, my lady.

625
00:59:59,272 --> 01:00:03,235
This is not a place where you can go
in bloodstained clothes.

626
01:00:41,982 --> 01:00:43,316
Your Majesty.

627
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,944
The profile of the lady
Councilor Park turned in today.

628
01:00:52,826 --> 01:00:55,036
He completely ignored my warning…

629
01:00:57,414 --> 01:00:58,790
and turned this in.

630
01:01:02,377 --> 01:01:03,461
Park Aok.

631
01:01:05,797 --> 01:01:07,215
That is my niece's name

632
01:01:08,216 --> 01:01:10,260
and also your name as of now.

633

PARK AOK

634
01:01:23,607 --> 01:01:25,108
Despite the high status,

635
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:29,404
she will be despised.

636
01:01:34,159 --> 01:01:36,244
Bring whoever you want.

637
01:01:39,289 --> 01:01:43,919
You will take part in the queen selection
under my niece's name.

638
01:01:44,794 --> 01:01:45,921
And you shall…

639
01:01:47,339 --> 01:01:48,715
become…

640
01:01:51,217 --> 01:01:52,761
the Queen of this country.

641
01:02:09,611 --> 01:02:12,614
