00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:05,460
BLOODY HEART

2
00:00:06,289 --> 00:00:09,209
THE PEOPLE, GROUPS, PLACES, AND INCIDENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE PURELY FICTIONAL

3
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,599
Lady Park, His Majesty shall enter.

4
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:21,929
I am here as requested!

5
00:00:22,229 --> 00:00:23,939
Let me see that face of yours.

6
00:00:48,499 --> 00:00:49,459
My lord?

7
00:01:03,849 --> 00:01:04,979
Why are you…

8
00:01:08,309 --> 00:01:09,689
here, my lord?

9
00:01:28,669 --> 00:01:31,749
There are ears all around us.

10
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:41,549
Your Majesty, please compose yourself.

11
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:45,599
-Eunuch Jung.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

12
00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:47,599
I shall interrogate Lady Park
for jealousy.

13
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:50,859
Do not let anybody follow me.

14
00:01:53,899 --> 00:01:56,279
Your order is my command.

15
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,359
Your Majesty.

16
00:01:58,859 --> 00:01:59,989
Your Majesty.

17
00:02:00,949 --> 00:02:02,659
He did not allow you to follow.

18
00:02:02,949 --> 00:02:06,199
You won't even hide
that you side with His Majesty.

19
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:08,119
All eunuchs belong to His Majesty.

20
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:11,749
How do you not know
that simple fact as the chief eunuch?

21
00:02:15,339 --> 00:02:18,419
Why are you all standing around
without protecting His Majesty?

22
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:32,649
Do not dare to follow His Majesty!

23
00:02:33,309 --> 00:02:34,569
It is his order.

24
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:11,939
Are you His Majesty?

25
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:14,609
My lord.

26
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:18,279
You were the Crown Prince all along?

27
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:26,779
How…

28
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,829
has this happened?

29
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:34,129
Why are you here in the palace?

30
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:38,959
How much does Councilor Park
know about you?

31
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:43,049
Does he know that you were
once to be the Crown Princess?

32
00:03:44,509 --> 00:03:45,589
No.

33
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:49,219
Is that

34
00:03:50,679 --> 00:03:51,889
all you have to say to me?

35
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:57,609
Why did you…

36
00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:00,479
Why did you return to the palace?

37
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:02,819
Did you forget everything

38
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:05,989
that happened to you here?

39
00:04:07,779 --> 00:04:09,949
If I had known you were His Majesty,

40
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:14,369
if I had known
my savior was the Crown Prince,

41
00:04:15,249 --> 00:04:17,459
I would have died before I came here.

42
00:04:20,249 --> 00:04:21,709
On every 15th we met,

43
00:04:23,549 --> 00:04:26,469
why didn't you tell me anything
over all those years?

44
00:04:26,549 --> 00:04:29,009
You should've said so
when I said I loved you.

45
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,689
If you had told me then…

46
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:40,109
I would have put an end
to these pathetic feelings.

47
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:34,499
BLOODY HEART
EPISODE 5

48
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:49,639
Are there any court ladies
that may recognize her?

49
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:51,599
It was before the wedding,
so no one was with her

50
00:05:52,179 --> 00:05:54,099
other than the court lady
who was dispatched.

51
00:05:54,719 --> 00:05:57,519
Also, all of them were
involved in the treason,

52
00:05:57,599 --> 00:05:59,229
so they were either killed or exiled.

53
00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:00,769
How much…

54
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:05,279
does Councilor Park know?

55
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:08,149
Your Majesty.

56
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:10,279
This is the chance in a lifetime.

57
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:12,949
Councilor Park brought in a stranger

58
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:15,369
and claimed her as his niece
to make her your concubine.

59
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:18,579
This is contempt of the Royal Family,
no, it's even treason.

60
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,419
You now have just cause
to punish Councilor Park!

61
00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:23,919
Wouldn't Councilor Park know that?

62
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,879
What if he knew who she was?

63
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:28,919
Then he becomes the one
who saved the traitor's daughter.

64
00:06:29,549 --> 00:06:31,679
Councilor Park brought her up as his niece

65
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,009
and made her your concubine.

66
00:06:33,549 --> 00:06:35,009
That's the story you can work with.

67
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:38,809
Your Majesty, it's your chance
to get rid of Councilor Park

68
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:41,309
instead of waiting for Siwol
to pass the state exam.

69
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:44,769
If I do that,

70
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:51,449
Lady Jeong will die.

71
00:06:54,619 --> 00:06:56,159
We must check first.

72
00:06:57,489 --> 00:06:58,619
I'll act

73
00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:01,669
only after I make sure.

74
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,789
I will go to Councilor Park's home!

75
00:07:12,929 --> 00:07:14,049
Giddy-up!

76
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:01,099
<i>It was not my blunder.</i>

77
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:03,479
<i>It was yours.</i>

78
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,529
<i>Why did you make such a foolish move?</i>

79
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:18,159
<i>Were you counting on the feelings
of a man's frivolous heart?</i>

80
00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:20,489
<i>I did.</i>

81
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:24,289
<i>You are the successor of the late King.</i>

82
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:27,959
<i>The late King was a feeble ruler,</i>

83
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:31,339
<i>but he was a very tough husband.</i>

84
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:38,969
The list for officials.

85
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:43,309
You may fill it up
with the names you like.

86
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:47,269
No matter who they are, they will receive
a proper title, land, and slaves.

87
00:08:47,349 --> 00:08:51,189
I will also hold a magnificent ceremony
for the woman you bring as a concubine.

88
00:08:51,859 --> 00:08:53,399
-Your Majesty.
-Hence,

89
00:08:54,859 --> 00:08:56,909
do not discuss
the deposal of the Queen any longer.

90
00:08:56,989 --> 00:09:01,289
Her Majesty's household
used to serve the deposed king.

91
00:09:01,869 --> 00:09:03,539
How do you expect us

92
00:09:03,619 --> 00:09:05,659
to honor the daughter of a criminal
as the Queen?

93
00:09:07,329 --> 00:09:08,879
She is not the daughter of a criminal.

94
00:09:10,499 --> 00:09:12,049
She's the Crown Prince's mother

95
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:14,169
and my wife.

96
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:23,929
<i>Which path will you take, Your Majesty?</i>

97
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,059
<i>Will it be power?</i>

98
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:28,769
<i>Or will it be</i>

99
00:09:29,809 --> 00:09:31,479
<i>your love?</i>

100
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:46,459
Have you been expecting me?

101
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:51,169
I've been waiting for you to summon me.

102
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:55,629
How can you act so rashly as the King?

103
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:56,969
Next time,

104
00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:01,599
send your order through a royal secretary
and have me come in.

105
00:10:02,099 --> 00:10:04,309
If you expected my visit,

106
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:09,979
it means you know who Lady Park really is.

107
00:10:11,939 --> 00:10:13,319
Do you?

108
00:10:14,229 --> 00:10:16,029
She is your lover

109
00:10:17,069 --> 00:10:20,569
and a token of my loyalty.

110
00:10:21,619 --> 00:10:24,739
All I want is for you to spend

111
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:27,959
a hundred happy years with your lover.

112
00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:30,419
Despite the danger, you did all this

113
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:33,459
for me?

114
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:38,469
How shall I reciprocate your loyalty?

115
00:10:44,349 --> 00:10:46,889
I, Left State Councilor Park Gyewon!

116
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:49,519
Please accept me…

117
00:10:57,989 --> 00:11:00,029
as your subject.

118
00:11:32,099 --> 00:11:33,229
<i>He doesn't know.</i>

119
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,279
I must have overestimated you,
Councilor Park.

120
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:43,609
I know you were in a rush,

121
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:45,699
but you played

122
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:48,489
such a poor move.

123
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:53,169
In the end, all you wanted was one thing.

124
00:11:57,419 --> 00:11:58,709
Power in the future.

125
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:01,759
The Queen Dowager is with you,

126
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,719
but the Queen isn't on your side,

127
00:12:05,969 --> 00:12:07,679
how will you have power in the future?

128
00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:13,559
And nobody will stay loyal to a man
who'll lose his power in the future.

129
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:17,769
Is that why you did something
so atrocious and foolish?

130
00:12:18,979 --> 00:12:20,859
You treated the Royal Family with contempt

131
00:12:20,939 --> 00:12:23,239
and broke the law,
yet did you expect to live?

132
00:12:30,829 --> 00:12:32,119
I'll wait and see

133
00:12:32,869 --> 00:12:36,379
what the Queen Dowager will give up…

134
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:40,629
to save your life, Councilor Park.

135
00:12:53,849 --> 00:12:55,889
Were you after the Queen Dowager,

136
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:00,939
and not the State Tribunal?

137
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:12,999
Do you wish to run away?

138
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:30,179
Father.

139
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:34,729
Your shoulders are heavy with the weight
of the Royal Family, our family,

140
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:37,269
and even the <i>Sarim</i>.

141
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:44,859
Do you want to run away now
if it isn't too late?

142
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:51,119
I should've run away back then.

143
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:53,949
If I had,

144
00:13:56,249 --> 00:13:58,459
you, mother,

145
00:14:00,669 --> 00:14:03,169
and our family
wouldn't have been annihilated.

146
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:09,339
Then I wouldn't have met him,

147
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:13,389
and we wouldn't be hurting right now.

148
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:18,269
Jeong.

149
00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:25,669
-You cannot do this.
-Move!

150
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:28,669
Do you expect me to let her live
after ruining my bridal night?

151
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:31,259
What are you doing?
You must stop Lady Cho.

152
00:15:32,549 --> 00:15:33,679
All of you.

153
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,549
How dare you try to stop her?

154
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:37,469
Father.

155
00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:42,139
What's going on?

156
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:45,269
Who broke your heart?

157
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:48,779
Lady Park ruined my bridal night.

158
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:54,319
That's a good thing for you.

159
00:15:54,409 --> 00:15:56,449
-Father.
-People are saying after yesterday,

160
00:15:56,529 --> 00:15:58,829
Lady Park will be shunned for life.

161
00:15:59,409 --> 00:16:02,209
It's been said His Majesty's wrath
reached the skies.

162
00:16:04,369 --> 00:16:05,539
Is that true?

163
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:06,749
Of course.

164
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,299
So you must hurry
and greet the Queen Dowager.

165
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:14,339
How many times did I tell you to avoid
letting your elder find any faults in you?

166
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:18,219
But still, I don't want to go greet her.

167
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:20,559
Lady Park will be there.

168
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,309
His Majesty will…

169
00:16:24,349 --> 00:16:25,809
also be there.

170
00:16:31,689 --> 00:16:34,529
Court Lady Kim, what are you doing?
Help me get ready.

171
00:16:34,609 --> 00:16:35,739
Yes, my lady.

172
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:49,539
His Majesty ran into Lady Park's quarters?

173
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:51,589
There was turmoil through the night.

174
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:55,879
Lady Park must have made a mistake
as she is unfamiliar with palace customs.

175
00:16:56,089 --> 00:16:57,799
She may not know the customs,

176
00:16:58,219 --> 00:17:00,309
but she must know a thing or two
about men and women.

177
00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:05,269
His Majesty talked big
about how he'll never see her face,

178
00:17:05,769 --> 00:17:07,849
but he ended up seeing her.

179
00:17:10,979 --> 00:17:14,859
He needs to see her face
in order for him to fall for her.

180
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:28,749
His Majesty said

181
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:32,339
he would be unable to come
and greet you this morning.

182
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:41,639
I said I'll see him
with my daughters-in-law,

183
00:17:41,719 --> 00:17:42,809
but he won't come?

184
00:17:44,349 --> 00:17:47,389
A great son like His Majesty
will not treat his mother with disdain.

185
00:17:47,979 --> 00:17:50,229
He must be feeling under the weather.

186
00:17:50,979 --> 00:17:52,229
You are right.

187
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:56,029
I cannot just sit around as his mother.

188
00:17:58,859 --> 00:18:00,569
Send the royal physician immediately.

189
00:18:13,999 --> 00:18:15,629
It'll be a rough day.

190
00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:34,649
I heard His Majesty came last night.

191
00:18:35,689 --> 00:18:37,739
The guests in the annex
need to go into the palace.

192
00:18:38,449 --> 00:18:40,449
I'll call for someone
who'll escort the guests.

193
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,199
I will go.

194
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:50,169
This is lowly and dangerous.

195
00:18:50,249 --> 00:18:52,629
Our family's fate is upon this.

196
00:18:54,379 --> 00:18:57,879
We better keep this secret
away from others.

197
00:19:02,139 --> 00:19:03,549
Do as you like.

198
00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:11,809
My lady.

199
00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:14,939
Thank you.

200
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,789
Is this a dream, or is it real?

201
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:30,959
It's such an honor.

202
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,539
A girl you brought up became a concubine!

203
00:19:33,629 --> 00:19:35,789
Are we really allowed this?

204
00:19:35,879 --> 00:19:38,249
I only brought Aok up for a bit
when she was seven.

205
00:19:38,339 --> 00:19:39,299
Goodness.

206
00:19:40,969 --> 00:19:42,509
A year is a long time.

207
00:19:42,589 --> 00:19:46,349
You're the only one who showed
any kindness to that lowly family.

208
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:47,389
Yes.

209
00:19:47,469 --> 00:19:49,469
That's enough to make you
the Queen's mother.

210
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,569
If I'm the Queen's mother,
you are the Queen's brother.

211
00:19:59,729 --> 00:20:03,739
I'm suddenly about to become
a big success thanks to you, Mother.

212
00:20:13,789 --> 00:20:15,629
You're here, my lady.

213
00:20:15,709 --> 00:20:18,879
We'll soon schedule a date
for you to visit the palace.

214
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:22,089
Is Lady Park already looking for me?

215
00:20:22,169 --> 00:20:24,129
Of course. Once she sees you,

216
00:20:24,219 --> 00:20:26,009
she'll run out to welcome you.

217
00:20:26,089 --> 00:20:27,219
After all,

218
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,309
she adored me so much that
she thought of me as her own mother.

219
00:20:31,389 --> 00:20:34,229
If it hadn't been for me,
she would've starved to death

220
00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:36,229
with her sickly father in bed.

221
00:20:36,859 --> 00:20:41,399
I'm sure Lady Park is waiting
for the day to repay your kindness.

222
00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:46,779
Thank you.

223
00:20:58,079 --> 00:20:59,169
Lady Park.

224
00:21:09,719 --> 00:21:13,179
His Majesty was too ill
to greet me this morning,

225
00:21:13,269 --> 00:21:14,809
but he's in the archery field?

226
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:18,559
You may leave.

227
00:21:27,489 --> 00:21:29,569
He has tried hard
to play a good son until now.

228
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:33,499
Why is he suddenly
showing his true nature?

229
00:21:34,199 --> 00:21:35,119
Your Royal Highness.

230
00:21:35,209 --> 00:21:37,919
The two ladies have been
waiting for two hours.

231
00:21:37,999 --> 00:21:39,419
Let them wait.

232
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:42,999
Their husband shows disrespect
because his wife lacks virtue.

233
00:21:43,089 --> 00:21:44,009
Your Royal Highness.

234
00:21:44,089 --> 00:21:48,129
You should dismiss them
for Lady Park's sake…

235
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:55,849
Lady Cho.

236
00:21:56,179 --> 00:21:57,309
Come over here!

237
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:11,369
Stand upright.

238
00:22:12,199 --> 00:22:14,539
If you feel tired
after waiting for just two hours,

239
00:22:14,619 --> 00:22:15,999
your servants won't respect you.

240
00:22:24,709 --> 00:22:25,629
Your Royal Highness.

241
00:22:25,709 --> 00:22:28,679
Councilor Park did not come in today
due to a high fever.

242
00:22:29,219 --> 00:22:31,339
He fell ill on the same day
as His Majesty.

243
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:33,809
This isn't a petty issue.

244
00:22:34,309 --> 00:22:35,349
However,

245
00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:39,189
why hasn't he said a word to me?

246
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:43,189
Actually, he has sent you word
through a messenger.

247
00:22:46,069 --> 00:22:47,149
What is it?

248
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:55,659
Did Councilor Park fail to come in again?

249
00:22:55,739 --> 00:22:57,119
Yes, Your Majesty.

250
00:22:57,249 --> 00:23:00,249
-What about the Queen Dowager?
-She's quiet.

251
00:23:01,369 --> 00:23:03,749
It means he doesn't have any other moves.

252
00:23:05,129 --> 00:23:08,169
I must press the Queen Dowager
of her debt.

253
00:23:08,259 --> 00:23:09,299
You should be careful.

254
00:23:09,879 --> 00:23:12,799
Councilor Park has his hands on Lady Park.

255
00:23:13,139 --> 00:23:15,559
-You must be more cautious--
-I can't put this off any longer.

256
00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:19,059
The longer she remains in the palace,

257
00:23:20,309 --> 00:23:21,849
the more perilous it'll be.

258
00:23:25,609 --> 00:23:26,939
I'm visiting the Queen Dowager.

259
00:23:28,649 --> 00:23:29,649
Your Majesty.

260
00:23:38,579 --> 00:23:40,789
Lady Cho greets His Majesty.

261
00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:42,869
Where are you going?

262
00:23:42,959 --> 00:23:44,829
My mother and sister-in-law are coming,

263
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:46,419
so I'm on my way to see them.

264
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:53,219
You must be happy to see your mother.

265
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:56,139
I'm happy to see you, Your Majesty.

266
00:23:57,929 --> 00:24:00,929
The flower
cannot come to see the butterfly,

267
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:04,559
so I am not allowed to see you.
I must always wait.

268
00:24:05,059 --> 00:24:07,689
I'm very thrilled to see you like this

269
00:24:07,769 --> 00:24:08,939
by coincidence.

270
00:24:10,939 --> 00:24:12,029
You may go.

271
00:24:47,768 --> 00:24:49,398
What brings you here?

272
00:24:50,478 --> 00:24:53,478
I thought
you stopped visiting your mother.

273
00:24:53,568 --> 00:24:57,698
Was there not any word
from the Left State Councilor?

274
00:24:58,658 --> 00:24:59,988
Such as?

275
00:25:00,698 --> 00:25:01,578
Right.

276
00:25:02,158 --> 00:25:06,038
You do not know,
so you are still such at peace.

277
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:12,088
I do not care what it is.
If you do not want to speak, stay silent.

278
00:25:13,798 --> 00:25:16,338
The ladies' families will soon be here,

279
00:25:16,418 --> 00:25:18,878
which is why I doubt
he will have any time for you.

280
00:25:20,178 --> 00:25:21,548
<i>The two ladies?</i>

281
00:25:23,348 --> 00:25:25,718
<i>Then Lady Park's family must be here too.</i>

282
00:25:42,818 --> 00:25:44,618
They just arrived at the palace.

283
00:26:06,258 --> 00:26:10,438
Lady Park, I also heard
you lost your mother when you were young.

284
00:26:12,058 --> 00:26:13,898
Who will be coming from your family?

285
00:26:14,858 --> 00:26:16,648
Madame Yoon will be here.

286
00:26:17,898 --> 00:26:19,028
It must be lonely.

287
00:26:20,398 --> 00:26:23,908
I also have a stepmother,
but she is nothing to my real mother.

288
00:26:25,448 --> 00:26:29,158
Then were you raised with a nanny?

289
00:26:29,868 --> 00:26:31,958
Your father has been ill for decades,

290
00:26:32,538 --> 00:26:34,078
so I doubt he got remarried.

291
00:26:35,878 --> 00:26:38,668
Our family was poor,
so I only had one servant.

292
00:26:41,928 --> 00:26:43,798
Madame Yoon is here.

293
00:27:01,738 --> 00:27:02,818
You are here.

294
00:27:02,898 --> 00:27:06,868
It's a great joy to see
how composed you look.

295
00:27:12,408 --> 00:27:13,918
Who are you, madame?

296
00:27:14,498 --> 00:27:18,128
I'm the aunt who raised Lady Park,

297
00:27:18,298 --> 00:27:21,508
no, I'm almost like her birth mother.

298
00:27:26,968 --> 00:27:29,308
You're almost like her birth mother?

299
00:27:30,428 --> 00:27:32,308
She said she only had a servant.

300
00:27:32,388 --> 00:27:33,848
She didn't.

301
00:27:33,938 --> 00:27:37,768
She didn't even have a servant,
so I looked after her all the time.

302
00:27:39,148 --> 00:27:40,398
Is that so?

303
00:27:40,478 --> 00:27:44,988
I hope Lady Park comes quickly
and tells you.

304
00:27:45,488 --> 00:27:49,238
When will Lady Park get here?

305
00:28:05,178 --> 00:28:06,508
I am Lady Park.

306
00:28:08,548 --> 00:28:09,798
Who are you?

307
00:28:10,888 --> 00:28:12,018
I'm sorry?

308
00:28:13,598 --> 00:28:15,348
I do not know who you are.

309
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:17,848
Why do you say you raised me?

310
00:28:22,818 --> 00:28:24,818
Why do you have trouble
recognizing Lady Park?

311
00:28:25,398 --> 00:28:27,528
You must have lied to me.

312
00:28:27,608 --> 00:28:30,368
Madame, no.

313
00:28:30,448 --> 00:28:32,738
That lady

314
00:28:32,828 --> 00:28:35,038
is not Aok.

315
00:28:35,908 --> 00:28:38,918
I remember her face clearly.

316
00:28:38,998 --> 00:28:41,628
It was only for a short while,
but I fed her and bathed her.

317
00:28:41,708 --> 00:28:43,508
How could I not recognize her?

318
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:46,418
For a short while? You said
you raised her through her childhood.

319
00:28:46,508 --> 00:28:47,718
Did you lie to me?

320
00:28:49,138 --> 00:28:51,048
I… Well, that's…

321
00:28:52,468 --> 00:28:55,348
I apologize.
She said she was like your mother,

322
00:28:55,428 --> 00:28:57,848
and I was foolish enough to believe her.

323
00:28:59,978 --> 00:29:01,358
Drag her out immediately.

324
00:29:01,438 --> 00:29:04,608
I shall ask the State Tribunal
to clear Lady Park's disgrace.

325
00:29:06,608 --> 00:29:09,028
Madame, no. Please forgive me.

326
00:29:09,108 --> 00:29:12,698
It's not me. That woman is a fake.

327
00:29:13,158 --> 00:29:15,748
She really isn't Aok!

328
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:27,378
Please believe me!

329
00:29:27,508 --> 00:29:30,968
It's not me. That woman is a fake.

330
00:29:31,048 --> 00:29:34,178
Please! She is not Aok!

331
00:29:34,718 --> 00:29:35,768
Madame!

332
00:29:44,148 --> 00:29:47,028
I'm reminded of a romance novel
I once read back in my father's home.

333
00:29:49,778 --> 00:29:51,738
When the lady died in a war,

334
00:29:52,238 --> 00:29:54,158
her maid pretended to be the lady

335
00:29:54,238 --> 00:29:57,448
and even married a scholar,
living her life as a noble.

336
00:29:58,118 --> 00:29:59,908
It was a very fun novel.

337
00:30:03,248 --> 00:30:04,628
Then I'll see you later.

338
00:30:12,388 --> 00:30:15,178
Go tell my father what you just saw.

339
00:30:20,098 --> 00:30:22,848
Who put you up for this atrocity
to deceive Madame Yoon?

340
00:30:22,938 --> 00:30:27,028
Who would dare make me do such a thing?

341
00:30:27,858 --> 00:30:30,858
I did exaggerate a little
by saying I raised her for a long time,

342
00:30:30,948 --> 00:30:33,818
but everything I said is true.

343
00:30:33,908 --> 00:30:36,488
Then what?
You simply couldn't recognize Lady Park?

344
00:30:36,578 --> 00:30:39,578
How can I not recognize a girl
I raised for a whole year?

345
00:30:39,658 --> 00:30:41,708
She really isn't Aok!

346
00:30:41,788 --> 00:30:42,868
You wicked woman!

347
00:30:43,628 --> 00:30:47,208
Aok has a big mole under her belly button.

348
00:30:47,298 --> 00:30:49,008
Once you check that,

349
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:52,088
you will find out
if I'm telling the truth or not.

350
00:30:52,178 --> 00:30:53,298
How dare you!

351
00:30:53,388 --> 00:30:56,638
Are you suggesting I should
look through a concubine's body?

352
00:30:56,968 --> 00:30:59,058
She's impossible. Punish her now!

353
00:30:59,638 --> 00:31:01,478
No, my lord.

354
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:03,808
Please believe me.

355
00:31:03,898 --> 00:31:05,518
My lord!

356
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:08,478
I'm not a good person,
but I'm not so bad that I should die.

357
00:31:08,568 --> 00:31:10,738
Please, my lord.

358
00:31:11,648 --> 00:31:12,778
Please!

359
00:31:18,078 --> 00:31:19,288
<i>Because of me,</i>

360
00:31:20,158 --> 00:31:24,578
<i>Lady Jeong is once again
in a life-or-death situation.</i>

361
00:31:27,338 --> 00:31:29,048
Have the chief of State Tribunal come in.

362
00:31:37,008 --> 00:31:40,428
Lady Park, His Majesty's eunuch is here.

363
00:31:41,348 --> 00:31:42,728
Let him in.

364
00:32:13,878 --> 00:32:15,928
Please call me Eunuch Jung.

365
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:19,298
I am a eunuch to His Majesty.

366
00:32:19,758 --> 00:32:22,518
However, if anything blocks his way,

367
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:26,598
I will slay them no matter who they are,
even if it's against his wish.

368
00:32:32,068 --> 00:32:35,068
You may relay his message.

369
00:32:35,698 --> 00:32:39,408
Even Madame Yoon was deceived,
but she was partially speaking the truth.

370
00:32:39,488 --> 00:32:40,778
Many people

371
00:32:42,078 --> 00:32:44,118
back in her town witnessed

372
00:32:44,198 --> 00:32:47,208
that she used to call Lady Park
as "Mole-ok."

373
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:50,878
Then they must all know
what Lady Park looks like.

374
00:32:50,958 --> 00:32:54,798
It was for a short while
when she was young, so no one remembers.

375
00:32:56,258 --> 00:32:58,548
However, since
that woman's account is trustworthy,

376
00:32:58,638 --> 00:33:00,048
you should look at her body--

377
00:33:00,138 --> 00:33:02,888
Your Majesty, Lady Park is here.

378
00:33:03,308 --> 00:33:04,308
Let her come in.

379
00:33:16,778 --> 00:33:18,148
This concerns you, so I called you.

380
00:33:20,738 --> 00:33:21,988
You may continue.

381
00:33:25,998 --> 00:33:27,998
We confirmed that Seo deceived Madame Yoon

382
00:33:28,078 --> 00:33:30,958
by telling her that
she is Lady Park's aunt.

383
00:33:31,958 --> 00:33:35,628
Since we confirmed her lie,
punish her by flogging.

384
00:33:37,628 --> 00:33:39,878
I humbly accept your order, Your Majesty.

385
00:34:09,038 --> 00:34:12,828
I'll tell the Royal Medical Office
to prepare some calming medicine.

386
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,878
It'll help you sleep.

387
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,178
Councilor Park…

388
00:34:23,218 --> 00:34:25,428
does not know your identity yet.

389
00:34:26,968 --> 00:34:30,728
But he won't stop
before he gets what he wants.

390
00:34:31,438 --> 00:34:32,518
You're right.

391
00:34:33,398 --> 00:34:35,398
Councilor Park
would have annihilated the <i>Sarim</i>

392
00:34:36,728 --> 00:34:38,898
and my family at any time.

393
00:34:40,488 --> 00:34:41,898
Then Your Majesty,

394
00:34:44,658 --> 00:34:46,908
why did you deceive me?

395
00:34:49,828 --> 00:34:50,958
Is that really…

396
00:34:53,248 --> 00:34:55,038
all you can say to me?

397
00:34:56,378 --> 00:34:57,588
You might die…

398
00:34:58,958 --> 00:35:00,588
because of this.

399
00:35:00,668 --> 00:35:01,838
Right now,

400
00:35:03,888 --> 00:35:06,638
you're more important than my life.

401
00:35:08,968 --> 00:35:10,768
You were the only one in this world

402
00:35:12,098 --> 00:35:14,688
who really knew who I was.

403
00:35:17,108 --> 00:35:20,228
Do you know how much it meant to me?

404
00:35:24,608 --> 00:35:26,568
You should have trusted me more.

405
00:35:34,368 --> 00:35:35,628
What will you do?

406
00:35:37,418 --> 00:35:39,798
I chose to come into the palace.

407
00:35:40,378 --> 00:35:42,468
I shall find a way by myself.

408
00:35:45,678 --> 00:35:47,258
Not once…

409
00:35:50,258 --> 00:35:52,228
have my feelings for you…

410
00:35:56,398 --> 00:35:58,268
been untrue.

411
00:36:00,228 --> 00:36:01,358
I only hoped

412
00:36:02,608 --> 00:36:04,608
for you to live in peace.

413
00:36:05,198 --> 00:36:06,198
However,

414
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:08,908
you are now…

415
00:36:11,738 --> 00:36:13,908
between life and death
once again because of me.

416
00:36:16,248 --> 00:36:17,328
I am…

417
00:36:19,248 --> 00:36:20,498
so sorry.

418
00:36:38,648 --> 00:36:41,228
-Are they still nearby?
-Yes.

419
00:36:41,318 --> 00:36:43,148
I'm sure they're chasing us.

420
00:36:46,398 --> 00:36:50,198
They've followed us for 300km.
It means they're watching us.

421
00:36:51,158 --> 00:36:52,788
I don't think we should run away

422
00:36:52,868 --> 00:36:55,158
without knowing
if Lady Jeong is dead or alive.

423
00:36:55,248 --> 00:36:57,748
Jeong said she can only escape
as long as we are safe.

424
00:36:57,828 --> 00:37:00,538
I'm sure those men are
watching us because of her.

425
00:37:01,708 --> 00:37:03,128
What on earth is going on?

426
00:37:03,708 --> 00:37:05,508
My lord, I…

427
00:37:06,628 --> 00:37:07,628
will return to the city.

428
00:37:08,218 --> 00:37:10,338
No, what if you get caught?

429
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:11,888
They're only watching us from afar,

430
00:37:12,468 --> 00:37:13,928
so they won't notice

431
00:37:14,018 --> 00:37:17,098
if you act as if I got hurt
and began to carry me on the wagon.

432
00:37:17,518 --> 00:37:21,768
I need to know if she's alive
to eat another meal in peace. Please?

433
00:37:25,488 --> 00:37:28,948
What kind of rascals
scattered bamboo peels all over?

434
00:37:31,028 --> 00:37:33,328
How dare they do this to our family?

435
00:37:33,408 --> 00:37:35,038
I'll sweep it up quickly.

436
00:37:35,908 --> 00:37:38,208
You have to go to the palace today.
Don't do that.

437
00:37:38,408 --> 00:37:40,038
Maksool!

438
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:43,208
I feel bad for Maksool. That's why.

439
00:37:43,288 --> 00:37:45,548
I'll clean up right away,
so you should go in.

440
00:37:45,628 --> 00:37:46,708
Goodness.

441
00:37:47,128 --> 00:37:49,878
Come on. I got this.

442
00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:50,798
Gosh.

443
00:37:53,968 --> 00:37:55,178
Ttong…

444
00:37:56,848 --> 00:37:57,978
Ttong.

445
00:38:03,308 --> 00:38:05,188
-Uncle Ma!
-You're safe.

446
00:38:05,608 --> 00:38:08,858
I was worried that
you might have disappeared like Hyang.

447
00:38:09,448 --> 00:38:11,858
Uncle Ma, are you all right?

448
00:38:13,238 --> 00:38:15,198
What is it? Tell me.

449
00:38:15,278 --> 00:38:17,538
What on earth is going on?

450
00:38:19,498 --> 00:38:21,118
Seo may have told a lie,

451
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:23,998
but I do not think this concerns
the Office of Inspector General.

452
00:38:24,088 --> 00:38:27,588
But it does concern an official,
so we should investigate Lady Park.

453
00:38:29,258 --> 00:38:30,338
Inspector Park, leave us.

454
00:38:31,218 --> 00:38:34,138
This concerns your family,
so you cannot deal with the matter.

455
00:38:36,348 --> 00:38:38,178
You clearly don't know him well enough.

456
00:38:45,478 --> 00:38:48,318
Inspector Park's priorities
as an inspector

457
00:38:48,568 --> 00:38:51,858
lie above the matters of his family.

458
00:38:52,528 --> 00:38:57,328
He is the one out of all my pupils
that I am most proud of.

459
00:38:59,078 --> 00:39:02,158
I know how upright he is.

460
00:39:03,668 --> 00:39:07,128
But this concerns the Internal Court,

461
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:10,048
so it won't be easy to get involved.

462
00:39:10,128 --> 00:39:11,588
Please let me take care of this.

463
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:14,048
Can you do it?

464
00:39:15,508 --> 00:39:16,388
Yes.

465
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:21,428
I'll find out the truth before long.
For Lady Park, if anything.

466
00:39:36,238 --> 00:39:38,618
Mother!

467
00:39:38,868 --> 00:39:40,078
Deok.

468
00:39:42,198 --> 00:39:44,538
Were you arrested too?

469
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:47,078
No.

470
00:39:48,248 --> 00:39:51,088
Madame Yoon helped me see you.

471
00:39:51,668 --> 00:39:52,798
I see.

472
00:39:52,878 --> 00:39:55,378
Why did you make such a mistake?

473
00:39:55,468 --> 00:39:59,928
It wasn't a mistake.
She really wasn't Aok.

474
00:40:00,008 --> 00:40:02,348
Mother, please get a grip!

475
00:40:02,678 --> 00:40:05,558
My family and I will end up dead soon!

476
00:40:13,488 --> 00:40:16,108
Deok, I must've seen it wrong.

477
00:40:16,198 --> 00:40:19,448
So please let me see her one more time.

478
00:40:19,738 --> 00:40:23,288
This time, I'll open my eyes wide
and look at her.

479
00:40:23,368 --> 00:40:24,828
So please, just once.

480
00:40:28,248 --> 00:40:29,378
Please.

481
00:40:30,538 --> 00:40:31,548
It's too late.

482
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:34,508
Your mistake was too grave.

483
00:40:35,218 --> 00:40:37,178
There is no way to patch it up.

484
00:41:07,788 --> 00:41:09,828
<i>Lord Park's political enemies are
trying to use you</i>

485
00:41:09,918 --> 00:41:12,208
<i>to put the blame on him.</i>

486
00:41:12,998 --> 00:41:13,958
<i>So, Mother…</i>

487
00:41:15,588 --> 00:41:16,668
<i>Mother…</i>

488
00:41:19,588 --> 00:41:20,638
<i>Please…</i>

489
00:42:07,138 --> 00:42:08,768
Your mother's brave decision

490
00:42:10,018 --> 00:42:12,228
just saved you and your family.

491
00:42:14,268 --> 00:42:15,438
Also,

492
00:42:16,778 --> 00:42:18,858
our family is greatly indebted to her.

493
00:42:29,408 --> 00:42:30,498
Aunt Seo…

494
00:42:31,868 --> 00:42:33,498
took her own life?

495
00:42:33,578 --> 00:42:34,498
Yes.

496
00:42:34,838 --> 00:42:37,798
However, that isn't the only problem.

497
00:42:37,878 --> 00:42:39,008
Eumjeon was there

498
00:42:40,798 --> 00:42:42,758
when Seo took her own life.

499
00:42:45,218 --> 00:42:48,428
I received a letter
from my mother that said

500
00:42:48,518 --> 00:42:52,478
I must save my brother
who was arrested by the State Tribunal.

501
00:42:53,648 --> 00:42:54,858
I was deceived too.

502
00:42:54,938 --> 00:42:56,978
Why did you run to the State Tribunal

503
00:42:57,068 --> 00:42:58,648
over some letter from a stranger?

504
00:42:58,938 --> 00:43:02,358
And you even told the officers that
you were Lady Park's attendant?

505
00:43:02,448 --> 00:43:06,658
I just wanted to check
if my brother was really arrested.

506
00:43:09,618 --> 00:43:11,538
Please spare my life, Lady Park.

507
00:43:15,328 --> 00:43:16,998
All the evidence

508
00:43:18,378 --> 00:43:19,878
points to me.

509
00:43:23,338 --> 00:43:26,928
Councilor Park will
come to the palace today.

510
00:43:51,158 --> 00:43:52,658
How far are you willing to go?

511
00:43:54,668 --> 00:43:56,378
Only one person

512
00:43:57,708 --> 00:43:59,338
can answer that question.

513
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:03,628
So ask His Majesty
to spare your life instead of me.

514
00:44:04,218 --> 00:44:07,298
That means you have a way around this.

515
00:44:07,888 --> 00:44:11,098
You also have a way around this
called His Majesty.

516
00:44:11,178 --> 00:44:14,808
Also, I already gave you a shield.

517
00:44:16,478 --> 00:44:19,108
You're my niece, Lady Park.

518
00:44:19,898 --> 00:44:22,108
There is no stronger shield than that.

519
00:44:36,168 --> 00:44:38,628
All of those people
have arrived in the Gyeongsang area.

520
00:44:38,878 --> 00:44:40,458
Do not worry.

521
00:44:51,222 --> 00:44:52,142
Your Majesty.

522
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:56,062
You cannot take a matter
over one's social status this lightly.

523
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:59,402
When Seo took her own life,
Lady Park's attendant was also there.

524
00:44:59,482 --> 00:45:01,692
We cannot take this lightly either.

525
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,362
How dare you speak like that?

526
00:45:03,442 --> 00:45:05,282
Are you suggesting Lady Park killed her?

527
00:45:05,362 --> 00:45:06,412
Your Majesty.

528
00:45:07,242 --> 00:45:10,162
You cannot be deceived
by some crazy woman's talk.

529
00:45:10,492 --> 00:45:15,042
Seo told a lie, then took her own life,
scared of the consequences.

530
00:45:15,542 --> 00:45:18,792
Your Majesty, we do not even check
the virginity of the candidates

531
00:45:19,132 --> 00:45:21,002
if they are here to become the Queen.

532
00:45:21,632 --> 00:45:24,092
Because it is disrespectful

533
00:45:24,172 --> 00:45:27,682
to even speak of the behavior
of the future Queen in that way.

534
00:45:27,762 --> 00:45:32,432
And it's because we believe
noblewomen keep themselves chaste.

535
00:45:32,522 --> 00:45:35,272
So if she dared to assume
someone else's identity,

536
00:45:36,142 --> 00:45:38,852
it also means
she deceived the Royal Family.

537
00:45:39,152 --> 00:45:41,112
Not only should we look into Lady Park,

538
00:45:41,192 --> 00:45:43,402
we should also investigate Councilor Park.

539
00:45:50,572 --> 00:45:52,702
I, Left State Councilor Park Gyewon,

540
00:45:56,792 --> 00:45:59,212
request His Majesty
to allow for my resignation.

541
00:46:00,502 --> 00:46:02,842
Please give me your approval!

542
00:46:03,922 --> 00:46:05,882
My family is involved in a scandal

543
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,722
that stained the honor of the Royal Family

544
00:46:08,802 --> 00:46:10,762
and threatened
the foundation of our country.

545
00:46:11,682 --> 00:46:12,722
This must be

546
00:46:13,722 --> 00:46:15,562
punished by death.

547
00:46:45,882 --> 00:46:47,512
I ask of you.

548
00:46:47,592 --> 00:46:52,092
Please disclose every little detail
regarding Lady Park's identity.

549
00:46:52,682 --> 00:46:55,392
If her crimes are confirmed as true,

550
00:46:56,222 --> 00:46:58,732
you must quarter her four limbs

551
00:47:00,022 --> 00:47:04,612
and display the greatness
of the Royal Family!

552
00:47:20,292 --> 00:47:22,582
What is it you really want?

553
00:47:23,832 --> 00:47:27,132
Please accept Lady Park.

554
00:47:27,712 --> 00:47:30,222
If you accept her as who she is,

555
00:47:30,882 --> 00:47:34,512
who would dare be suspicious of her?

556
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:36,562
If I want to let her live,

557
00:47:38,642 --> 00:47:41,982
I should take her as your niece
and let it go?

558
00:47:43,772 --> 00:47:46,022
Which also means I should take you in?

559
00:47:47,532 --> 00:47:48,732
I am

560
00:47:50,112 --> 00:47:52,362
your loyal subject, Your Majesty.

561
00:47:53,742 --> 00:47:54,702
Please do not

562
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:59,042
drive me away.

563
00:48:01,122 --> 00:48:02,122
Oh, dear.

564
00:48:08,132 --> 00:48:09,842
I cannot do that.

565
00:48:09,922 --> 00:48:12,092
Seo's lies were confirmed as true.

566
00:48:12,172 --> 00:48:14,932
I understand your desperation to resign,

567
00:48:15,512 --> 00:48:17,222
but your resignation is…

568
00:48:20,142 --> 00:48:21,482
rejected.

569
00:49:16,032 --> 00:49:17,992
His Majesty is here.

570
00:49:19,742 --> 00:49:21,412
The royal court is in an uproar!

571
00:49:22,202 --> 00:49:25,622
I cannot lift my face
at this bizarre and ridiculous incident.

572
00:49:26,752 --> 00:49:28,632
Do not let anybody in.

573
00:49:29,502 --> 00:49:33,172
I shall interrogate Lady Park myself.

574
00:49:50,232 --> 00:49:51,652
Leave the palace.

575
00:49:53,442 --> 00:49:54,492
Lady Jeong.

576
00:49:55,072 --> 00:49:58,032
You deceived the Left State Councilor
and the royal family.

577
00:49:59,032 --> 00:50:01,032
He'll simply be dismissed from his office.

578
00:50:01,122 --> 00:50:02,492
But you will…

579
00:50:06,122 --> 00:50:07,872
end up beheaded.

580
00:50:12,502 --> 00:50:14,132
You must leave the palace.

581
00:50:14,212 --> 00:50:16,052
Only then will you live.

582
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:19,762
Just as how…

583
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:24,722
I held that mysterious scholar's hand…

584
00:50:26,432 --> 00:50:27,892
back on that day?

585
00:50:31,522 --> 00:50:33,442
The crafters of Bamboo Grove Village are…

586
00:50:35,192 --> 00:50:36,652
in Councilor Park's hands.

587
00:50:37,902 --> 00:50:38,952
I…

588
00:50:41,162 --> 00:50:42,492
cannot leave.

589
00:50:44,452 --> 00:50:45,702
But you must go.

590
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:47,962
My people's lives are at stake.

591
00:50:49,422 --> 00:50:51,632
You may be the one who spared my life,

592
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:55,592
but they're the ones
who taught me the reasons to live.

593
00:50:56,172 --> 00:50:57,882
They are my blood…

594
00:50:59,882 --> 00:51:01,142
and my family.

595
00:51:31,332 --> 00:51:32,792
Eat up before the officer comes.

596
00:51:33,542 --> 00:51:36,502
What about Jinsa Lim and Lady Jeong?

597
00:51:37,132 --> 00:51:38,342
Are they all right?

598
00:51:38,422 --> 00:51:40,012
Worry about yourself.

599
00:51:40,092 --> 00:51:43,892
The district magistrate is
about to kill all of you. Goodness.

600
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:48,392
-What are we going to do?
-What do you think?

601
00:51:50,562 --> 00:51:52,392
Pull yourselves together.

602
00:51:52,482 --> 00:51:55,022
Even if our flesh is shredded,
we do not know a thing.

603
00:51:55,612 --> 00:52:00,072
They were criticized by other nobles
because they were in this business,

604
00:52:00,152 --> 00:52:02,612
but they didn't care
and helped us make a living.

605
00:52:03,072 --> 00:52:06,032
If you forget that,
we're less than beasts.

606
00:52:08,452 --> 00:52:12,002
Make sure you keep your mouth shut. Okay?

607
00:52:13,292 --> 00:52:15,712
The one who kept visiting her.

608
00:52:17,212 --> 00:52:19,172
Don't ever speak of him.

609
00:52:19,802 --> 00:52:21,262
Of course, I won't.

610
00:52:22,802 --> 00:52:23,882
Eat up.

611
00:52:38,732 --> 00:52:40,692
I came to examine Lady Park's body.

612
00:52:42,442 --> 00:52:45,532
Give me a moment.
I will let Lady Park know.

613
00:52:46,282 --> 00:52:47,372
Remove them.

614
00:52:48,742 --> 00:52:50,332
-Let go of me!
-Oh no. Wait.

615
00:53:02,842 --> 00:53:05,632
-Did you come to examine my body?
-Yes.

616
00:53:05,722 --> 00:53:08,142
It will only take a moment.

617
00:53:09,392 --> 00:53:11,522
Who gave you this order?

618
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:13,982
It is the Queen Dowager's order.

619
00:53:33,952 --> 00:53:35,752
-Escort her to the room.
-Halt.

620
00:53:38,252 --> 00:53:40,462
I will receive the order
from the Queen Dowager herself.

621
00:53:40,542 --> 00:53:43,592
We can forcibly examine you if we must.

622
00:53:47,762 --> 00:53:48,892
Look around and see

623
00:53:50,512 --> 00:53:53,892
if there is anybody
who does not work as ears and eyes

624
00:53:54,642 --> 00:53:56,272
for the left state councilor.

625
00:53:59,482 --> 00:54:01,482
Is there such a person in this palace?

626
00:54:02,942 --> 00:54:04,692
I am the niece of the King's merit subject

627
00:54:04,782 --> 00:54:06,652
and the left state councilor.

628
00:54:09,662 --> 00:54:11,282
Do you still dare to examine me?

629
00:54:14,662 --> 00:54:16,752
I will go see the Queen Dowager myself.

630
00:54:17,542 --> 00:54:19,002
Do not follow me.

631
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:33,762
Your Royal Highness,
Lady Park of Chaeokdang is here.

632
00:55:00,372 --> 00:55:03,542
Inspector Park also says
it is right to examine your body.

633
00:55:04,552 --> 00:55:06,422
Why do you not obey my order?

634
00:55:08,092 --> 00:55:09,132
Your Royal Highness.

635
00:55:09,722 --> 00:55:10,932
A member of the Internal Court

636
00:55:11,472 --> 00:55:14,182
cannot allow strange women
to examine her body.

637
00:55:14,762 --> 00:55:18,562
And she's a court lady who's in charge
of inspecting other court ladies.

638
00:55:20,142 --> 00:55:21,352
This is my office's decision.

639
00:55:22,102 --> 00:55:25,192
Seo may have told a lie,
but it was partially true.

640
00:55:26,362 --> 00:55:30,282
It's only right to examine her body
and see if she really is Lady Park.

641
00:55:32,362 --> 00:55:33,662
This is for your sake.

642
00:55:34,532 --> 00:55:35,532
I will not accept.

643
00:55:35,622 --> 00:55:38,082
My uncle also agrees with me.

644
00:55:40,002 --> 00:55:41,622
Do not speak such careless words.

645
00:55:42,582 --> 00:55:46,212
Councilor Park also wishes
to treat this matter fairly.

646
00:55:46,632 --> 00:55:48,592
How can I trust the court lady?

647
00:55:49,172 --> 00:55:52,882
What will you do if she tells a lie
after examining my body?

648
00:55:52,972 --> 00:55:55,762
Then, I will send a few
trustworthy and older court ladies.

649
00:55:56,892 --> 00:55:59,892
How many people must I show my body to?

650
00:56:02,102 --> 00:56:03,562
Your Royal Highness,

651
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:06,322
why do you try to humiliate me as such?

652
00:56:07,402 --> 00:56:08,652
Your Royal Highness,

653
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:11,402
we must disclose the truth soon
to subdue this scandal.

654
00:56:15,412 --> 00:56:17,952
<i>What's on Councilor Park's mind?</i>

655
00:56:19,122 --> 00:56:21,832
<i>How come he has not said a word to me?</i>

656
00:56:28,592 --> 00:56:29,712
Your Majesty.

657
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:33,012
Lady Park's disrespect is unacceptable.

658
00:56:33,092 --> 00:56:35,392
If she dares to disobey
the Queen Dowager's order,

659
00:56:36,262 --> 00:56:37,722
she will take your orders lightly.

660
00:56:37,802 --> 00:56:40,272
What Lady Park said is only proper.

661
00:56:40,352 --> 00:56:43,522
How can a member of the Internal Court
show her body to just anybody?

662
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:45,652
Your Majesty.

663
00:56:45,732 --> 00:56:50,402
What if we bring somebody
whom Lady Park can trust?

664
00:56:56,032 --> 00:56:57,242
Someone…

665
00:56:58,782 --> 00:57:00,452
Lady Park can trust?

666
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:01,912
Yes, Your Majesty.

667
00:57:03,292 --> 00:57:04,502
Who?

668
00:57:04,582 --> 00:57:07,002
There is only one person

669
00:57:08,132 --> 00:57:09,802
whom she will trust.

670
00:57:13,132 --> 00:57:15,632
There is only one person

671
00:57:16,592 --> 00:57:18,432
who can examine Lady Park's body.

672
00:57:19,972 --> 00:57:21,392
It is you, Your Majesty.

673
00:57:36,412 --> 00:57:38,372
<i>Once His Majesty confirms her identity,</i>

674
00:57:38,452 --> 00:57:41,282
who would dare speak of this again?

675
00:57:43,252 --> 00:57:47,712
Make sure His Majesty
examines her himself.

676
00:58:02,392 --> 00:58:05,682
Which path will you take, Your Majesty?

677
00:58:08,852 --> 00:58:10,482
<i>Will it be power?</i>

678
00:58:11,192 --> 00:58:12,772
<i>Or will it be your love?</i>

679
00:58:14,822 --> 00:58:16,782
<i>It is your move, Your Majesty.</i>

680
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:20,242
<i>Will you save her?</i>

681
00:58:20,822 --> 00:58:22,372
<i>Or will you kill her?</i>

682
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:21,092
<i>My love…</i>

683
00:59:22,472 --> 00:59:23,932
<i>who was ruined because of me.</i>

684
00:59:51,542 --> 00:59:52,792
Lady Jeong.

685
00:59:55,462 --> 00:59:57,002
I have decided…

686
01:00:02,012 --> 01:00:03,302
to abandon you.

687
01:01:15,792 --> 01:01:18,042
I went to Lady Park's quarters.

688
01:01:23,472 --> 01:01:24,722
Lady Park…

689
01:01:52,372 --> 01:01:54,702
being Left State Councilor
Park Gyewon's niece

690
01:01:58,752 --> 01:01:59,922
is true.

691
01:02:10,892 --> 01:02:13,892
BLOODY HEART

692
01:02:14,261 --> 01:02:16,136
SPECIAL THANKS TO BAEK HYEON-JU

<i>Remove Lady Park's litter.</i>

695
01:02:36,202 --> 01:02:38,462
<i>I said I will not see Lady Park.</i>

696
01:02:38,542 --> 01:02:42,792
<i>From now on, you are nothing
but Councilor Park's niece to me.</i>

697
01:02:42,882 --> 01:02:43,842
<i>That fan…</i>

698
01:02:44,422 --> 01:02:48,052
<i>If you fall in danger in the palace,
His majesty will do something risky again.</i>

699
01:02:48,132 --> 01:02:50,342
<i>So, please leave.</i>

700
01:02:50,932 --> 01:02:52,182
<i>I will leave.</i>

701
01:02:52,802 --> 01:02:57,182
<i>I'll live with my people,
as I have in the past.</i>

702
01:02:58,102 --> 01:03:01,482
<i>This is bad. I cannot find Lady Park.</i>

703
01:03:01,562 --> 01:03:03,112
<i>Lock every gate in the palace!</i>

704
01:03:03,192 --> 01:03:06,152
<i>Do not let anybody leave the palace!</i>
