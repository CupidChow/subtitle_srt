BLOODY HEART

2
00:00:46,258 --> 00:00:49,178
THE PEOPLE, GROUPS, PLACES, AND INCIDENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE PURELY FICTIONAL

3
00:00:55,728 --> 00:00:57,978
You asked who my real enemy was.

4
00:01:01,398 --> 00:01:03,398
Did you find your answer?

5
00:01:04,408 --> 00:01:05,408
Yes.

6
00:01:06,368 --> 00:01:08,158
And I am here to give you the answer.

7
00:01:09,538 --> 00:01:12,788
Once I hear it,

8
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:15,208
I would like to give you an answer
as well.

9
00:02:17,228 --> 00:02:18,228
I choose…

10
00:02:22,778 --> 00:02:25,068
not to breathe vengeance on anyone.

11
00:02:28,778 --> 00:02:32,738
The cost of it will be
unnecessary bloodshed.

12
00:02:34,448 --> 00:02:37,288
I refuse to walk the same path as you.

13
00:02:39,248 --> 00:02:42,588
Then what is it that you will do?

14
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:45,968
The path my father couldn't take.

15
00:02:47,838 --> 00:02:49,928
The path my mentor avoided.

16
00:02:53,348 --> 00:02:54,718
By His Majesty's side,

17
00:02:55,928 --> 00:02:58,268
I will have him be a benevolent leader.

18
00:03:01,108 --> 00:03:03,318
As my father once said,

19
00:03:04,858 --> 00:03:07,148
he is the one served by the skies.

20
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:21,998
Do you believe he has
the makings of a benevolent king?

21
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:27,258
Power vested in one who does not

22
00:03:27,968 --> 00:03:29,128
will only…

23
00:03:36,018 --> 00:03:37,928
rain tyranny upon us all.

24
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:40,308
Who are you to assess one's makings?

25
00:03:41,478 --> 00:03:45,818
It has been the meritorious subjects
who thwarted him from blooming.

26
00:03:47,108 --> 00:03:48,938
The path you are describing

27
00:03:50,448 --> 00:03:52,408
is that of the Queen.

28
00:03:52,488 --> 00:03:53,778
Then, the Queen…

29
00:03:55,118 --> 00:03:56,488
I shall be.

30
00:04:03,078 --> 00:04:04,918
As your niece.

31
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:10,128
A niece who is in fact my mortal enemy
and the one who will eventually

32
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:13,638
weaken my position.

33
00:04:25,688 --> 00:04:28,688
It is now your turn to answer.

34
00:04:41,828 --> 00:04:44,378
BLOODY HEART
EPISODE 10

35
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:58,808
Was it you who sent Songbaek?

36
00:05:00,018 --> 00:05:00,978
Yes.

37
00:05:02,808 --> 00:05:04,518
What did Lady Park say?

38
00:05:04,598 --> 00:05:06,518
That she would see you

39
00:05:07,818 --> 00:05:09,318
as Yoo Haksoo's daughter.

40
00:05:11,568 --> 00:05:12,568
Why…

41
00:05:13,488 --> 00:05:14,908
did you hide this from me?

42
00:05:17,908 --> 00:05:19,078
This is karma at its worst.

43
00:05:22,908 --> 00:05:25,998
Yoo Haksoo once said this
about his own daughter.

44
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:31,548
That she would have easily
become a minister had she been born a boy.

45
00:05:31,838 --> 00:05:32,668
However,

46
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:36,758
he was glad that she was not born as one.

47
00:05:39,388 --> 00:05:40,888
I have finally realized why.

48
00:05:50,148 --> 00:05:53,318
If she had been born a man,
the royal family and the court

49
00:05:53,398 --> 00:05:56,818
as well as the public would have
led her down the path of a traitor.

50
00:05:58,988 --> 00:06:00,278
Lady Park.

51
00:06:01,868 --> 00:06:03,828
I will have her crowned as my Queen.

52
00:06:09,498 --> 00:06:10,838
And I will comply

53
00:06:12,048 --> 00:06:14,548
for your sake and our family's. However,

54
00:06:15,758 --> 00:06:18,838
although she is your niece on paper,
she is still Yoo Haksoo's daughter.

55
00:06:21,888 --> 00:06:23,598
Aren't you afraid of the repercussions?

56
00:06:25,768 --> 00:06:26,768
I am.

57
00:06:27,438 --> 00:06:28,848
But to eliminate her

58
00:06:29,898 --> 00:06:31,728
would be a waste.

59
00:06:33,318 --> 00:06:34,148
My lord!

60
00:06:34,238 --> 00:06:36,358
I was never gifted a worthy king,

61
00:06:36,448 --> 00:06:38,238
so I choose to at least serve…

62
00:06:40,118 --> 00:06:41,578
a fitting queen.

63
00:06:54,338 --> 00:06:55,338
<i>Jeong,</i>

64
00:06:56,338 --> 00:07:00,888
<i>I am not sending you
to the palace for personal gain.</i>

65
00:07:02,098 --> 00:07:05,808
<i>A king's actions
can bring peace to the people</i>

66
00:07:05,888 --> 00:07:07,688
<i>or trouble.</i>

67
00:07:08,638 --> 00:07:09,688
<i>That is why</i>

68
00:07:10,728 --> 00:07:12,058
<i>a king is said to reign over…</i>

69
00:07:13,858 --> 00:07:15,188
<i>even the skies.</i>

70
00:07:59,148 --> 00:08:00,148
Today,

71
00:08:02,198 --> 00:08:04,528
I spent the entire day with farmers.

72
00:08:06,538 --> 00:08:07,618
Never have I…

73
00:08:08,948 --> 00:08:11,248
been in such close proximity to them.

74
00:08:11,328 --> 00:08:12,628
Every day,

75
00:08:13,578 --> 00:08:15,998
I spend my hours with
court officials and meritorious subjects.

76
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:21,468
From here on out,
I will learn about my people…

77
00:08:24,178 --> 00:08:25,428
and their lives.

78
00:08:26,558 --> 00:08:28,098
And I wish to protect them.

79
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:32,268
A king who hides the truth

80
00:08:33,768 --> 00:08:35,808
cannot be a true king to the people.

81
00:08:35,898 --> 00:08:37,358
Time…

82
00:08:39,488 --> 00:08:41,278
is what I need.

83
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:45,908
Once I have regained authority
over the officials,

84
00:08:47,448 --> 00:08:50,158
I will be sure
to clear your father's name.

85
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,288
May one ask…

86
00:08:56,378 --> 00:08:57,798
for you to wait?

87
00:09:18,068 --> 00:09:19,528
I will wait.

88
00:09:24,028 --> 00:09:25,948
It is my King who makes the promise.

89
00:09:30,578 --> 00:09:31,908
So I will wait.

90
00:09:58,058 --> 00:09:59,188
The poster

91
00:10:00,438 --> 00:10:03,358
accusing me of murdering
late Queen Inyoung

92
00:10:04,988 --> 00:10:06,408
will not be spoken of.

93
00:10:08,658 --> 00:10:12,078
-My lord!
-Banchon is where the poster was put up.

94
00:10:12,238 --> 00:10:14,958
Who am I to punish
young scholars of the Confucian Academy

95
00:10:15,038 --> 00:10:16,618
for speaking their minds?

96
00:10:17,288 --> 00:10:20,458
Besides, we have
a more pressing matter at hand.

97
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,298
Once the majority of the court agrees,

98
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,548
His Majesty or the Queen Dowager

99
00:10:27,088 --> 00:10:29,218
will not oppose our proposal.

100
00:10:29,298 --> 00:10:31,258
Regarding the lady who is to be Queen?

101
00:10:33,058 --> 00:10:38,268
I will crown Lady Park as Queen.

102
00:10:44,938 --> 00:10:48,488
You seek approval
of Lady Park as the next Queen?

103
00:10:48,568 --> 00:10:50,238
Yes, Your Majesty.

104
00:10:50,318 --> 00:10:51,698
And the Queen Dowager?

105
00:10:51,778 --> 00:10:53,948
Even the Queen Dowager

106
00:10:54,038 --> 00:10:56,578
approves of Lady Park.

107
00:10:59,918 --> 00:11:02,378
Then I will honor my mother
as well as the officials before me

108
00:11:03,088 --> 00:11:06,668
and announce Lady Park
as the future Queen.

109
00:11:07,798 --> 00:11:12,298
-We are much obliged, Your Majesty.
-We are much obliged, Your Majesty.

110
00:11:51,468 --> 00:11:53,428
<i>Lady Park will be
promoted to Royal Concubine</i>

111
00:11:54,008 --> 00:11:55,968
<i>and will be served as Queen-to-be.</i>

112
00:11:56,968 --> 00:11:58,768
<i>She will be granted the title Consort</i>

113
00:11:59,098 --> 00:12:01,098
<i>and have authority
over the Internal Court.</i>

114
00:12:03,148 --> 00:12:04,938
<i>Her crowning will take place</i>

115
00:12:05,018 --> 00:12:07,318
<i>once the three-year
mourning period passes.</i>

116
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:09,238
<i>Both I</i>

117
00:12:10,108 --> 00:12:12,278
<i>and the royal family concur.</i>

118
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:44,558
<i>As requested by Your Highness,</i>

119
00:12:44,648 --> 00:12:47,478
<i>I will free all those
from Bamboo Grove Village.</i>

120
00:12:48,028 --> 00:12:52,358
<i>This is my answer to your decision.</i>

121
00:12:52,448 --> 00:12:54,068
Honey!

122
00:12:54,158 --> 00:12:55,698
Kids!

123
00:12:56,328 --> 00:12:57,198
My gosh.

124
00:12:57,828 --> 00:12:58,988
Oh, dear.

125
00:13:14,428 --> 00:13:15,468
Dear!

126
00:13:20,218 --> 00:13:21,518
Master, welcome back.

127
00:13:34,858 --> 00:13:37,948
How can His Majesty
treat our family so poorly?

128
00:13:38,868 --> 00:13:41,288
Make sure Lady Cho
does not act recklessly.

129
00:13:41,948 --> 00:13:45,078
Our time will come,
so do not seem fazed until then.

130
00:13:45,288 --> 00:13:47,458
It is not only her
who must be reminded to stay calm.

131
00:13:52,258 --> 00:13:53,628
Get your act together.

132
00:13:54,588 --> 00:13:57,218
His Majesty and Councilor Park
cannot collude forever.

133
00:14:00,178 --> 00:14:01,678
They cannot walk side to side.

134
00:14:03,308 --> 00:14:05,768
Consort Park may have
brought them to an agreement,

135
00:14:06,688 --> 00:14:08,188
but the union will not last.

136
00:15:49,828 --> 00:15:50,708
Your Majesty.

137
00:15:50,788 --> 00:15:53,458
I, Ham Changik, Chief Army Commander
of Hamgyong Province

138
00:15:53,668 --> 00:15:56,248
bow before you as summoned.

139
00:15:56,758 --> 00:15:59,338
I understand it was a long trip.

140
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:01,048
I appreciate your generosity,

141
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:04,888
but how can one ever be exhausted
to be summoned by His Majesty?

142
00:16:05,468 --> 00:16:07,308
However, upon entering the palace,

143
00:16:07,388 --> 00:16:09,938
I noticed sycophants
and subjects who wield power

144
00:16:10,018 --> 00:16:11,978
persecute His Majesty.

145
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:14,478
Brimming tears blind me

146
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:16,688
for I am mortified by what I have seen.

147
00:16:22,238 --> 00:16:25,368
Did you just say that my uncle
is to be sent to Jeolla Province?

148
00:16:26,328 --> 00:16:28,408
You choose to send one of my few relatives

149
00:16:28,498 --> 00:16:30,578
so far away.

150
00:16:30,658 --> 00:16:35,128
His Majesty has already appointed him
as governor of Jeolla Province.

151
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:36,708
From what I hear,

152
00:16:36,798 --> 00:16:39,168
His Majesty brought my uncle in
to place him nearby.

153
00:16:40,298 --> 00:16:42,088
So have him sent to Gyeonggi Province.

154
00:16:42,678 --> 00:16:43,588
Your Highness.

155
00:16:43,678 --> 00:16:46,388
The position cannot be filled lightly.

156
00:16:47,678 --> 00:16:49,178
He may be your uncle,

157
00:16:49,268 --> 00:16:51,228
but you know how often

158
00:16:51,308 --> 00:16:54,228
he has spoken ill
of the meritorious subjects.

159
00:16:54,308 --> 00:16:55,518
Can the two of you

160
00:16:56,438 --> 00:16:57,858
please excuse us?

161
00:17:18,168 --> 00:17:22,088
Your Highness, the Chief of Capital Bureau
answers to Minister Cho

162
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:24,338
and other members of his family

163
00:17:24,428 --> 00:17:27,718
are in high ranks of the Palace Guard
and Central Army Division.

164
00:17:28,098 --> 00:17:29,388
Considering that--

165
00:17:30,388 --> 00:17:32,518
I do not care for state affairs!

166
00:17:32,598 --> 00:17:34,518
Will my family be in close proximity

167
00:17:34,598 --> 00:17:36,268
or will he be chased away?

168
00:17:39,148 --> 00:17:40,728
Just answer me that.

169
00:17:48,488 --> 00:17:49,448
Please know…

170
00:17:51,368 --> 00:17:53,658
that I earnestly request
that he stays close.

171
00:17:56,328 --> 00:17:57,248
Your Highness,

172
00:18:00,498 --> 00:18:02,338
Governor of Gyeongi Province…

173
00:18:04,218 --> 00:18:06,468
is a key position
we cannot afford to lose.

174
00:18:20,478 --> 00:18:23,028
The one who chases away
your family member…

175
00:18:24,818 --> 00:18:27,698
will use his own flesh and blood
to reap power and authority.

176
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:33,788
Do as you may.

177
00:18:34,788 --> 00:18:36,158
After all,

178
00:18:38,628 --> 00:18:40,498
when have you ever been wrong?

179
00:18:55,228 --> 00:18:57,138
Tell her that I am only free

180
00:18:57,558 --> 00:18:58,808
to greet the Queen Dowager.

181
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:03,068
We are both concubines,
but yet she summons me.

182
00:19:03,148 --> 00:19:06,108
She is the Royal Concubine
soon to be crowned as Queen.

183
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:07,278
Then,

184
00:19:08,358 --> 00:19:10,818
say that I will greet her
once she is crowned.

185
00:19:12,448 --> 00:19:13,908
I will excuse myself, then.

186
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,378
Is this not a simple task?

187
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:25,668
I apologize--

188
00:19:26,258 --> 00:19:27,918
Get out. Out!

189
00:19:28,008 --> 00:19:30,088
I truly apologize, Lady Cho.

190
00:19:37,388 --> 00:19:38,558
Do not say anything.

191
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:43,818
Letting her live is as stressful enough.

192
00:19:50,608 --> 00:19:52,488
She used the Queen Dowager as an excuse?

193
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:55,658
Yes, I doubt she plans
to greet you any time soon.

194
00:19:57,118 --> 00:19:59,328
If Lady Cho is not at ease,

195
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:01,578
her court maids will feel her wrath.

196
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:05,588
It did seem like Ttonggeum
was taking the worst of it.

197
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:11,008
I only mention her since you seem to care.

198
00:20:14,758 --> 00:20:16,388
Was it that obvious to you?

199
00:20:17,308 --> 00:20:18,598
I will be more careful.

200
00:20:19,138 --> 00:20:21,308
She is one of Lady Cho's court maids.

201
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:24,148
Taking her in
will cause quite the commotion.

202
00:20:25,898 --> 00:20:28,738
That I know too well.

203
00:20:33,068 --> 00:20:35,198
The King's Treasury is empty.

204
00:20:36,158 --> 00:20:38,408
I did hear that rats
were eating away at it.

205
00:20:38,498 --> 00:20:40,618
Now is not the time to intervene.

206
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,128
Does it involve those of rank?

207
00:20:45,628 --> 00:20:49,088
The Queen Dowager does not
take interest in frivolous affairs.

208
00:20:49,168 --> 00:20:52,378
It was probably eaten away by those
who thrive on her having authority.

209
00:21:04,518 --> 00:21:07,268
Your Highness, I hear you summoned me.

210
00:21:17,198 --> 00:21:19,368
For what reason did she seek you out?

211
00:21:19,448 --> 00:21:21,998
To ask me something, Your Majesty.

212
00:21:22,078 --> 00:21:24,038
I rarely get to see her,

213
00:21:25,538 --> 00:21:26,958
but you see her quite often.

214
00:21:29,248 --> 00:21:30,628
What did she want?

215
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:33,468
That I should seek a place
for a discreet memorial service.

216
00:21:36,758 --> 00:21:38,218
A memorial service?

217
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:39,558
Yes, Your Majesty.

218
00:21:41,348 --> 00:21:43,178
It was around this time…

219
00:21:45,268 --> 00:21:46,728
that her family was annihilated.

220
00:21:49,938 --> 00:21:52,818
Madame Yoon, you now
only come by when requested.

221
00:21:52,898 --> 00:21:54,608
I apologize, Your Highness.

222
00:21:56,198 --> 00:21:57,198
Of course.

223
00:21:58,578 --> 00:22:01,788
How can you not be busy
when your niece is soon to be Queen?

224
00:22:02,448 --> 00:22:06,168
Serve her well until she is crowned.

225
00:22:06,248 --> 00:22:07,628
Yes, Your Highness.

226
00:22:17,468 --> 00:22:19,008
I will serve her

227
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:22,268
just as I have served you.

228
00:22:30,768 --> 00:22:33,648
His Majesty cares for her dearly.

229
00:22:34,358 --> 00:22:36,858
If she is to give birth to a son
before the crowning,

230
00:22:36,948 --> 00:22:39,948
I will have him be the Crown Prince.
Councilor Park will make sure of it.

231
00:22:41,908 --> 00:22:45,748
And I will aid him in any way that I can.

232
00:22:47,288 --> 00:22:50,458
As a Queen renowned for her virtues,

233
00:22:50,538 --> 00:22:53,628
we will have her be praised
by all the people.

234
00:22:54,838 --> 00:22:58,178
In no way will she grow old and die

235
00:22:58,258 --> 00:23:00,798
as a wife who is not loved by her husband

236
00:23:00,888 --> 00:23:03,428
and as a lady of the palace
with no connections or children!

237
00:23:04,678 --> 00:23:07,018
That is why I humbly request

238
00:23:07,098 --> 00:23:10,148
that you tend to Her Highness' needs

239
00:23:12,188 --> 00:23:13,318
and care dearly…

240
00:23:17,238 --> 00:23:18,858
for her.

241
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:41,388
What is that I am seeing?

242
00:23:42,468 --> 00:23:44,808
What abomination
has replaced the flower garden?

243
00:23:45,098 --> 00:23:47,678
I hear that the land is being cultivated.

244
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:49,438
By whose orders?

245
00:23:49,518 --> 00:23:52,018
It was upon Consort Park's request.

246
00:23:57,528 --> 00:24:00,068
What… is that foul smell?

247
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:02,118
It is the smell of fertilizer.

248
00:24:02,488 --> 00:24:03,658
What is a fertilizer?

249
00:24:03,738 --> 00:24:04,908
Manure made from

250
00:24:04,988 --> 00:24:09,288
decayed feces and urine ash,
Your Highness.

251
00:24:10,328 --> 00:24:11,618
Night soil…

252
00:24:13,838 --> 00:24:15,668
is being scattered all over my garden?

253
00:24:17,378 --> 00:24:18,548
How dare she!

254
00:24:19,548 --> 00:24:22,388
When I, the Queen Dowager,
walk through the garden every day?

255
00:24:27,058 --> 00:24:30,138
Do not just stand there.
I want this foul smell to be removed!

256
00:24:30,228 --> 00:24:31,348
Yes, Your Highness.

257
00:24:31,688 --> 00:24:33,858
Bring me new clothes to change into.

258
00:24:33,938 --> 00:24:35,608
My clothes reek of the odor.

259
00:24:37,608 --> 00:24:39,648
-Burn this.
-Yes, Your Highness.

260
00:24:39,738 --> 00:24:43,108
How dare a consort
think this lowly of the Queen Dowager?

261
00:24:43,868 --> 00:24:45,368
Bring me flowers.

262
00:24:45,448 --> 00:24:47,288
Fill the room with flowers!

263
00:24:48,078 --> 00:24:49,748
Go on. Bring flowers.

264
00:24:50,748 --> 00:24:52,958
The odor is all around me.

265
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:55,288
My garden…

266
00:24:55,998 --> 00:24:57,418
My room…

267
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:00,968
Even my room reeks of the odor.

268
00:25:22,608 --> 00:25:26,198
Why has His Majesty
gifted me with plain clothes?

269
00:25:27,448 --> 00:25:30,868
He must wish to travel incognito with you.

270
00:25:35,788 --> 00:25:37,208
I wish to settle on a date

271
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:39,708
for our private outing.

272
00:25:40,378 --> 00:25:42,008
By that, you mean…

273
00:25:42,588 --> 00:25:43,588
I thought

274
00:25:44,718 --> 00:25:46,218
you would be feeling confined.

275
00:25:50,308 --> 00:25:53,428
I hear you headed back
without seeing me the other day.

276
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:55,938
I apologize.

277
00:25:56,848 --> 00:25:59,858
You probably gave me space
to let me vent my frustration.

278
00:26:00,898 --> 00:26:03,028
Your kindness is worth noticing.

279
00:26:10,198 --> 00:26:11,158
Your Highness,

280
00:26:11,658 --> 00:26:13,958
I wish to ask you something.

281
00:26:15,328 --> 00:26:16,418
I will allow it.

282
00:26:17,128 --> 00:26:19,038
Consort Park is one of your own,

283
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:21,798
but you seem unsatisfied with her.

284
00:26:25,218 --> 00:26:26,338
Am I right to assume that?

285
00:26:29,638 --> 00:26:30,468
You are.

286
00:26:32,348 --> 00:26:34,058
She has much to hide,

287
00:26:34,138 --> 00:26:35,808
which does not earn my trust.

288
00:26:39,608 --> 00:26:40,478
You see,

289
00:26:41,438 --> 00:26:45,028
I am aware of one of her secrets.

290
00:26:46,318 --> 00:26:47,778
A secret of hers?

291
00:26:48,988 --> 00:26:49,908
What would that be?

292
00:26:50,828 --> 00:26:53,328
It is in regard to her origin.

293
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:58,788
If you are willing to wait,
my suspicions will be proven.

294
00:27:00,128 --> 00:27:01,378
How?

295
00:27:02,748 --> 00:27:06,128
There is a girl who secretly
informs Consort Park.

296
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:21,608
Lady Yeonhee's temper isn't like usual.

297
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:27,278
There must be something I don't know of.

298
00:28:07,688 --> 00:28:08,778
I remember them dying…

299
00:28:11,028 --> 00:28:12,488
around this time of year.

300
00:28:17,368 --> 00:28:18,828
I managed

301
00:28:20,248 --> 00:28:21,618
to have their bodies retrieved.

302
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:26,628
They rest at the Kwangheemun grave site.

303
00:28:27,798 --> 00:28:29,258
You should visit them today.

304
00:28:34,968 --> 00:28:37,388
Are you saying that my parents

305
00:28:38,888 --> 00:28:40,848
rest in a grave?

306
00:28:48,858 --> 00:28:51,358
For years, I have reproached myself

307
00:28:52,658 --> 00:28:54,528
for not being able to give them one.

308
00:29:00,788 --> 00:29:02,418
Thank you, Your Majesty.

309
00:29:20,848 --> 00:29:23,098
Consort Park and I will rest
before we head back.

310
00:29:23,188 --> 00:29:24,228
Do not disturb us.

311
00:29:24,308 --> 00:29:25,608
Yes, Your Majesty.

312
00:29:34,108 --> 00:29:38,328
Head through the back door
to where Eunuch Jung awaits you.

313
00:29:38,618 --> 00:29:40,538
The grave site is right past
the marketplace,

314
00:29:41,158 --> 00:29:42,708
but please be careful.

315
00:29:47,878 --> 00:29:50,498
HAN

316
00:29:52,088 --> 00:29:55,678
YOO

317
00:31:24,268 --> 00:31:26,428
The statement proving
Consort Park's false identity

318
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:27,888
is written in this letter.

319
00:31:28,308 --> 00:31:30,438
Yes, Lady Cho.
What do you wish to do with it?

320
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:32,898
Consort Park and His Majesty

321
00:31:33,398 --> 00:31:35,778
traveled incognito past Kwangheemun.

322
00:31:36,358 --> 00:31:38,778
I will inform him as soon as he returns

323
00:31:39,238 --> 00:31:42,238
and have her arrested
submitting this as proof.

324
00:32:01,218 --> 00:32:02,888
I took too long at the outhouse, didn't I?

325
00:32:02,968 --> 00:32:04,308
Thank you for taking my place.

326
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:08,428
Hardly. I am just happy to know
that you feel lighter.

327
00:32:41,588 --> 00:32:43,888
What does this even say?

328
00:32:47,768 --> 00:32:49,558
Consort?

329
00:32:51,268 --> 00:32:53,898
That refers to Miss.

330
00:32:56,438 --> 00:33:00,488
Did someone actually
testify to her identity?

331
00:33:09,788 --> 00:33:12,368
Miss… My goodness.

332
00:33:35,018 --> 00:33:37,568
Miss!

333
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:42,738
You wait this long to tell me?

334
00:33:42,818 --> 00:33:44,698
Lady Cho said she would tell you herself.

335
00:33:44,778 --> 00:33:47,318
So you told her about
His Majesty's outing?

336
00:33:47,698 --> 00:33:49,698
Why not sweep it under the rug?
Even if she knows…

337
00:33:50,998 --> 00:33:52,158
Father!

338
00:33:52,248 --> 00:33:54,418
How is Ttonggeum taking the letter

339
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:56,128
be evidence?

340
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:57,788
It is not just any letter.

341
00:33:58,378 --> 00:34:00,748
The paper was soaked
in musk water, you see.

342
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:03,128
Your hands will reek just by touching it.

343
00:34:03,838 --> 00:34:04,878
So?

344
00:34:04,968 --> 00:34:09,008
Please arrest her
once she arrives at the gate.

345
00:34:10,098 --> 00:34:11,768
If Ttonggeum delivered the letter,

346
00:34:11,848 --> 00:34:14,268
Consort Park's hand and clothes
will smell of musk as well.

347
00:34:14,348 --> 00:34:16,648
What if she claims
that it is the perfume she uses?

348
00:34:16,728 --> 00:34:18,308
She has always used the scent of orchids.

349
00:34:19,478 --> 00:34:20,978
So ignore anything she says

350
00:34:21,068 --> 00:34:22,568
and take her to the Queen Dowager.

351
00:34:25,278 --> 00:34:26,488
The Queen Dowager?

352
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:28,948
Once I have proof,

353
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:31,698
the Queen Dowager agreed to take over.

354
00:34:33,498 --> 00:34:35,328
Have you forgotten who she sides with?

355
00:34:35,408 --> 00:34:37,368
She is not fond of Consort Park.

356
00:34:40,498 --> 00:34:43,258
As if I would be that tactless.

357
00:34:44,718 --> 00:34:46,588
Having her in our corner makes for…

358
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:50,178
the perfect opportunity.

359
00:34:54,138 --> 00:34:56,558
She has lived half her life in the palace.

360
00:34:56,638 --> 00:34:58,598
She is no stranger to politics.

361
00:34:59,018 --> 00:35:00,398
To punish Councilor Park's niece

362
00:35:00,478 --> 00:35:03,028
on a matter even His Majesty
has turned a blind eye to

363
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:06,148
all by herself?

364
00:35:06,778 --> 00:35:07,988
If not,

365
00:35:09,158 --> 00:35:11,528
-then what else?
-Whatever her reason is,

366
00:35:13,868 --> 00:35:15,578
it is not for your sake.

367
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:27,298
Are they on their way?

368
00:35:28,628 --> 00:35:29,838
Yes, Your Highness.

369
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:31,848
Can they be trusted?

370
00:35:34,138 --> 00:35:36,058
Please, do not fret.

371
00:35:42,688 --> 00:35:46,028
I have rounded up those
who will do anything for money.

372
00:35:46,608 --> 00:35:50,698
Without knowing or caring
as to why, how, or who,

373
00:35:51,618 --> 00:35:54,828
they will do as told.

374
00:35:55,998 --> 00:35:57,408
You've done well.

375
00:35:57,498 --> 00:36:00,618
I am much obliged.

376
00:36:06,878 --> 00:36:09,718
Have one of our people keep watch
on the Queen Dowager's movements.

377
00:36:10,218 --> 00:36:12,468
-The Queen Dowager?
-This is not to be taken lightly.

378
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,808
We must ascertain her intentions.

379
00:36:17,388 --> 00:36:18,388
Your Highness,

380
00:36:18,478 --> 00:36:20,388
do you believe he is trustworthy?

381
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:24,188
The only person I trust right now
is Lady Cho.

382
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:28,898
I am up against a first senior rank
royal concubine who will soon be Queen.

383
00:36:28,988 --> 00:36:30,068
That is why…

384
00:36:31,488 --> 00:36:33,528
one must be held accountable.

385
00:36:33,618 --> 00:36:34,948
Once Councilor Park finds out…

386
00:36:36,488 --> 00:36:39,618
He will be grateful to have a reason
to eliminate Minister Cho.

387
00:36:41,578 --> 00:36:43,708
Lady Cho, blinded by her jealousy,

388
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:47,248
sent her court maid and nanny

389
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,758
to kill Consort Park.

390
00:36:52,088 --> 00:36:54,428
Did her court maid leave with the letter?

391
00:36:54,718 --> 00:36:55,598
Yes.

392
00:36:55,678 --> 00:37:00,098
Lady Cho said her court maid
would take it to Consort Park.

393
00:37:00,638 --> 00:37:01,728
Then,

394
00:37:03,308 --> 00:37:05,268
the hunt has begun.

395
00:37:07,068 --> 00:37:09,358
They have been instructed to kill

396
00:37:10,898 --> 00:37:12,278
whom the court maid meets.

397
00:38:29,898 --> 00:38:31,108
This will do.

398
00:38:57,758 --> 00:38:58,838
You filthy rat!

399
00:39:01,718 --> 00:39:03,678
You dare try to run away
after bumping into me?

400
00:39:03,768 --> 00:39:07,188
I apologize, my lady.
I was in such a hurry that--

401
00:39:07,808 --> 00:39:09,018
You are not to leave.

402
00:39:09,098 --> 00:39:11,608
I will have you arrested
by the Police Bureau.

403
00:39:12,728 --> 00:39:14,028
I am truly sorry.

404
00:39:14,108 --> 00:39:15,108
You are not to leave.

405
00:39:16,068 --> 00:39:18,608
Please show mercy
and look past her misconduct.

406
00:39:25,118 --> 00:39:26,208
Look where you are going.

407
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:34,918
Miss!

408
00:39:43,638 --> 00:39:46,138
<i>Your Majesty, could you come outside?</i>

409
00:39:47,058 --> 00:39:48,188
Silence.

410
00:39:48,688 --> 00:39:50,688
I will return to the palace after sundown.

411
00:39:53,938 --> 00:39:55,358
<i>Your Majesty,</i>

412
00:39:55,438 --> 00:39:57,318
<i>it is Left State Councilor Park.</i>

413
00:40:18,628 --> 00:40:19,588
What brings you?

414
00:40:20,178 --> 00:40:22,178
I saw cavalry guards while passing by

415
00:40:22,388 --> 00:40:24,388
and requested an audience.

416
00:40:24,968 --> 00:40:26,348
You say this is a coincidence?

417
00:40:26,428 --> 00:40:29,728
Is Consort Park inside?

418
00:40:30,438 --> 00:40:32,228
She is taking a brief nap.

419
00:40:32,728 --> 00:40:34,768
Should I wake her up for you?

420
00:40:53,958 --> 00:40:56,748
Who am I to wake her up from her nap?

421
00:40:57,208 --> 00:40:58,128
I will…

422
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:00,508
excuse myself.

423
00:41:14,978 --> 00:41:16,228
Bring me my horse.

424
00:41:16,818 --> 00:41:18,228
I must find Consort Park.

425
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:20,528
Is Her Highness not inside?

426
00:41:27,738 --> 00:41:29,908
His Majesty left through
the back door on his horse.

427
00:41:32,618 --> 00:41:34,918
-And my servants?
-They await nearby.

428
00:41:35,708 --> 00:41:38,248
Scour every inch of the marketplace
and paths nearby.

429
00:41:38,838 --> 00:41:40,918
Consort Park must be found.

430
00:41:48,888 --> 00:41:51,098
You came all this way
to deliver this letter?

431
00:41:51,178 --> 00:41:54,598
Yes. Take a look at it yourself.

432
00:41:54,688 --> 00:41:57,898
Read what is on it and rip it to pieces.

433
00:42:05,068 --> 00:42:09,988
CONSORT PARK DECEIVES THE WORLD
LIVING UNDER A STOLEN IDENTITY

434
00:42:15,078 --> 00:42:18,418
Our target is the one who receives
the letter from the court maid.

435
00:42:19,668 --> 00:42:21,338
It must be her.

436
00:42:29,888 --> 00:42:31,388
What is wrong, Miss?

437
00:42:31,468 --> 00:42:33,598
The letter was a trap
to lure you out here.

438
00:42:34,348 --> 00:42:36,098
We must return to His Majesty.

439
00:42:36,188 --> 00:42:38,228
It is not safe for us out here.

440
00:42:42,108 --> 00:42:45,108
Have all soldiers nearby
gather at Kwangheemun!

441
00:42:45,198 --> 00:42:46,238
Yes, Your Majesty.

442
00:42:53,618 --> 00:42:57,458
How could you have passed away
so suddenly?

443
00:43:02,798 --> 00:43:07,008
We only hope you find
an easy passage to eternity.

444
00:43:28,278 --> 00:43:29,488
Miss.

445
00:44:08,148 --> 00:44:09,608
Miss!

446
00:44:11,818 --> 00:44:13,948
Miss! Please save her!

447
00:44:14,528 --> 00:44:15,618
Miss!

448
00:44:15,698 --> 00:44:17,698
Please save her life!

449
00:45:19,058 --> 00:45:20,348
I am glad…

450
00:45:22,638 --> 00:45:24,058
you are unscathed.

451
00:45:38,618 --> 00:45:39,658
Your Majesty.

452
00:45:47,378 --> 00:45:48,418
Councilor Park,

453
00:45:49,338 --> 00:45:50,758
how did you know to come here?

454
00:45:51,338 --> 00:45:52,758
And who are these men?

455
00:45:53,338 --> 00:45:57,678
They are street thugs
who target women for their money.

456
00:45:58,218 --> 00:46:01,468
Thankfully, they caught my eye
as I was passing by.

457
00:46:05,648 --> 00:46:06,858
You expect me to believe that?

458
00:46:07,608 --> 00:46:08,688
It is true, Your Majesty.

459
00:46:16,488 --> 00:46:17,408
This girl.

460
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:20,158
Does she not serve Lady Cho?

461
00:46:31,048 --> 00:46:33,798
Yes, she tried to assist me today.

462
00:46:35,008 --> 00:46:37,298
-Consort Park--
-This must be cleaned up

463
00:46:37,388 --> 00:46:38,718
before the people see us.

464
00:46:55,028 --> 00:46:57,108
-Arrest them.
-Yes, Your Majesty.

465
00:47:12,878 --> 00:47:16,548
Chief of Capital Bureau is here.
By Minister Cho's orders, I presume.

466
00:47:27,728 --> 00:47:31,688
<i>Lady Cho could not have
orchestrated this herself.</i>

467
00:47:42,158 --> 00:47:43,908
I was neglectful, Your Majesty.

468
00:47:43,988 --> 00:47:46,448
I am aware that
she was the one to leave your side.

469
00:47:47,328 --> 00:47:48,248
However,

470
00:47:48,748 --> 00:47:51,578
how did Councilor Park
know she was in danger?

471
00:47:52,458 --> 00:47:54,248
And why was Lady Cho's court maid there?

472
00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:55,548
Moreover,

473
00:47:56,628 --> 00:48:00,088
commanders were already present
even before I gave the order.

474
00:48:00,888 --> 00:48:04,218
Did Councilor Park
deploy the officers at the Capital Bureau?

475
00:48:04,308 --> 00:48:05,348
No.

476
00:48:06,598 --> 00:48:10,058
He was searching for Consort Park
along with his servants.

477
00:48:11,398 --> 00:48:13,308
Chief of Capital Bureau…

478
00:48:15,068 --> 00:48:17,028
must be one of Minister Cho's.

479
00:48:49,348 --> 00:48:50,388
Your Majesty.

480
00:48:50,478 --> 00:48:52,268
Those arrested by the Capital Bureau

481
00:48:53,558 --> 00:48:54,978
are being interrogated.

482
00:48:57,188 --> 00:48:58,358
Do you…

483
00:48:59,318 --> 00:49:01,488
know anything about them?

484
00:49:03,278 --> 00:49:06,788
They are street thugs
who targeted me for money.

485
00:49:08,828 --> 00:49:10,868
Are you hiding something from me?

486
00:49:13,498 --> 00:49:16,208
All I know is what I have told you.

487
00:49:16,288 --> 00:49:18,548
Should I interrogate
Lady Cho's court maid instead?

488
00:49:21,758 --> 00:49:22,838
Please don't.

489
00:49:23,758 --> 00:49:25,638
She is like a sister to me.

490
00:49:26,678 --> 00:49:28,178
So to protect her,

491
00:49:30,348 --> 00:49:32,348
you have chosen to lie to me.

492
00:49:34,768 --> 00:49:35,858
You…

493
00:49:37,228 --> 00:49:39,188
You almost lost your life.

494
00:49:40,898 --> 00:49:44,528
What would I have done
should you have closed your eyes forever?

495
00:49:45,278 --> 00:49:47,158
That is all I could think of…

496
00:49:48,578 --> 00:49:49,948
while watching you sleep.

497
00:49:51,498 --> 00:49:52,868
What will become of me…

498
00:49:54,168 --> 00:49:56,378
should you never wake up?

499
00:50:38,588 --> 00:50:41,208
You said the order came from a lady.

500
00:50:41,958 --> 00:50:44,378
A composite sketch has been drawn
based on your description.

501
00:50:47,338 --> 00:50:49,048
Is this her?

502
00:50:52,138 --> 00:50:53,598
It has to be.

503
00:51:00,318 --> 00:51:01,478
<i>Your Highness,</i>

504
00:51:01,568 --> 00:51:04,648
it seems as though
something went sideways.

505
00:51:06,908 --> 00:51:08,068
The letter…

506
00:51:09,618 --> 00:51:12,698
was not delivered as planned.

507
00:51:54,158 --> 00:51:57,458
You knew about the attack
early enough to inform me.

508
00:51:57,828 --> 00:52:01,328
All I had were suspicions.
Nothing was concrete.

509
00:52:02,038 --> 00:52:05,048
So where will you go from here?

510
00:52:05,628 --> 00:52:08,128
You had the Chief of Capital Bureau
arrest the men.

511
00:52:08,468 --> 00:52:10,428
Will it be cleaned up on your end?

512
00:52:26,528 --> 00:52:27,938
Court Lady Han.

513
00:52:28,028 --> 00:52:30,358
The Queen Dowager tried
to assassinate Consort Park.

514
00:52:32,118 --> 00:52:33,698
That is the whole story.

515
00:52:42,748 --> 00:52:43,788
Songbaek.

516
00:53:05,108 --> 00:53:07,188
Also present at the scene

517
00:53:07,278 --> 00:53:10,398
were Lady Cho's court maid and nanny.

518
00:53:10,568 --> 00:53:14,778
Who would the world consider
the true culprit behind this attack to be?

519
00:53:16,158 --> 00:53:19,288
Now that we have
both been dealt our cards,

520
00:53:19,658 --> 00:53:21,248
a deal is to be made.

521
00:53:21,328 --> 00:53:23,618
Lady Cho is oblivious
of the event that took place.

522
00:53:23,708 --> 00:53:24,668
Furthermore,

523
00:53:25,248 --> 00:53:26,708
His Majesty must remain in the dark.

524
00:53:29,588 --> 00:53:32,798
Consort Park's life was in danger today.

525
00:53:33,428 --> 00:53:36,598
Someone must be held responsible.

526
00:53:36,678 --> 00:53:38,678
It should be the one who put it in motion.

527
00:53:39,718 --> 00:53:41,518
The Queen Dowager.

528
00:53:57,908 --> 00:54:00,868
You dare place all the responsibility

529
00:54:01,788 --> 00:54:04,458
on the Queen Dowager?

530
00:54:12,588 --> 00:54:16,928
It was she who sent assassins
after our future Queen.

531
00:54:19,058 --> 00:54:20,768
Consort Park's or the Queen Dowager's.

532
00:54:21,888 --> 00:54:24,348
It is high time you chose a side.

533
00:55:52,268 --> 00:55:53,438
Your Highness,

534
00:55:53,518 --> 00:55:55,688
Councilor Park is at the door.

535
00:56:03,118 --> 00:56:04,328
Have him enter.

536
00:56:28,428 --> 00:56:29,388
Your Highness,

537
00:56:34,188 --> 00:56:35,438
these walls…

538
00:56:38,898 --> 00:56:40,698
must be suffocating.

539
00:56:43,318 --> 00:56:46,328
You have always wished
to be free from the boudoir,

540
00:56:47,078 --> 00:56:49,748
but you were stuck in the palace
for half your life.

541
00:56:51,578 --> 00:56:53,668
It must have been stifling.

542
00:57:01,928 --> 00:57:03,008
Your Highness,

543
00:57:04,388 --> 00:57:07,268
may I suggest you visit Onyang Palace?

544
00:57:09,638 --> 00:57:13,438
Head out first and I will follow suit

545
00:57:15,228 --> 00:57:17,148
along with more necessities.

546
00:57:19,238 --> 00:57:20,278
Are you…

547
00:57:22,278 --> 00:57:24,118
ousting me?

548
00:57:24,948 --> 00:57:26,828
I am pleading with you

549
00:57:27,908 --> 00:57:32,368
to leave the Capital
before His Majesty uncovers the truth.

550
00:57:33,828 --> 00:57:35,418
Have it covered up before then.

551
00:57:37,128 --> 00:57:38,208
Kill someone,

552
00:57:38,708 --> 00:57:39,918
make a deal,

553
00:57:40,378 --> 00:57:41,258
anything.

554
00:57:43,088 --> 00:57:44,798
You have the means to do so.

555
00:57:46,138 --> 00:57:48,098
Even if I do,

556
00:57:48,968 --> 00:57:52,178
I will not be able
to wipe the slate clean.

557
00:57:53,808 --> 00:57:55,688
It was indisputably reckless

558
00:57:56,558 --> 00:57:57,648
and…

559
00:58:00,108 --> 00:58:01,858
foolish of you.

560
00:58:02,698 --> 00:58:06,408
For the sake of his daughter
and his family,

561
00:58:07,118 --> 00:58:09,408
Minister Cho will take ruthless measures.

562
00:58:10,488 --> 00:58:13,208
Who are you choosing to protect?

563
00:58:16,668 --> 00:58:17,918
Me?

564
00:58:20,548 --> 00:58:22,208
Or your niece?

565
00:58:24,218 --> 00:58:25,928
Or are you…

566
00:58:28,888 --> 00:58:31,308
trying to protect Consort Park from me?

567
00:58:39,438 --> 00:58:41,068
She is the Queen

568
00:58:42,528 --> 00:58:43,358
who is…

569
00:58:45,698 --> 00:58:47,738
needed in this country.

570
00:58:47,818 --> 00:58:48,908
I…

571
00:58:56,868 --> 00:58:59,588
I do not care about
the fate of this country.

572
00:59:01,498 --> 00:59:03,378
Are you choosing to abandon me?

573
00:59:05,798 --> 00:59:07,218
Just like before?

574
00:59:18,438 --> 00:59:19,978
Of course not.

575
00:59:20,688 --> 00:59:22,648
I am not abandoning you.

576
00:59:22,728 --> 00:59:23,858
I am…

577
00:59:27,068 --> 00:59:29,158
trying to protect you.

578
00:59:31,448 --> 00:59:32,658
<i>Your Highness!</i>

579
00:59:33,328 --> 00:59:36,708
<i>A litter awaits you outside.</i>

580
00:59:40,788 --> 00:59:41,788
I…

581
00:59:43,168 --> 00:59:46,258
will not take a step out of my palace.

582
00:59:47,128 --> 00:59:49,088
Once His Majesty uncovers the truth,

583
00:59:49,838 --> 00:59:54,598
he might respond with utmost cruelty.

584
00:59:57,228 --> 00:59:59,268
By then, it will be too late…

585
01:00:02,108 --> 01:00:04,608
for me to protect you.

586
01:00:36,518 --> 01:00:38,478
Have you not received your orders?

587
01:00:40,978 --> 01:00:42,188
Escort…

588
01:00:47,898 --> 01:00:49,028
Her Highness.

589
01:01:49,798 --> 01:01:52,468
Whatever you wish will become a reality!

590
01:01:52,548 --> 01:01:53,968
Come to me when you are ready!

591
01:01:55,468 --> 01:01:58,678
<i>You wicked monk. I admit defeat.</i>

592
01:03:12,958 --> 01:03:14,008
So tell me.

593
01:03:16,008 --> 01:03:18,548
Where do you think I will go from here?

594
01:03:39,028 --> 01:03:42,028
BLOODY HEART

595
01:04:02,508 --> 01:04:03,558
<i>Please have mercy.</i>

596
01:04:04,468 --> 01:04:06,598
<i>The one who deceived Lady Cho
and sent the assassins</i>

597
01:04:07,518 --> 01:04:08,688
<i>was the Queen Dowager.</i>

598
01:04:08,768 --> 01:04:12,398
Are you absolutely sure
you can give me what I want?

599
01:04:13,018 --> 01:04:15,778
<i>Ttonggeum was summoned by the King?</i>

600
01:04:15,858 --> 01:04:18,698
<i>Minister Cho is someone I need on my side.</i>

601
01:04:18,778 --> 01:04:21,068
<i>It is why I will cherish you.</i>

602
01:04:21,158 --> 01:04:24,278
I plan on retiring to the countryside.

603
01:04:24,738 --> 01:04:27,908
<i>Once you leave,
how badly will His Majesty treat me?</i>

604
01:04:29,788 --> 01:04:30,788
<i>My young wicked monk.</i>

605
01:04:31,918 --> 01:04:33,338
<i>Have my son…</i>

606
01:04:33,418 --> 01:04:35,048
<i>take his last breath.</i>
