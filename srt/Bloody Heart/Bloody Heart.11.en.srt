BLOODY HEART

2
00:00:06,242 --> 00:00:09,162
THE PEOPLE, GROUPS, PLACES, AND INCIDENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE PURELY FICTIONAL

3
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:15,692
So tell me.

4
00:01:17,192 --> 00:01:20,022
Where do you think I will go from here?

5
00:01:25,072 --> 00:01:26,782
Have me leave the palace again

6
00:01:27,912 --> 00:01:30,622
and it will be me who burns.

7
00:01:31,452 --> 00:01:32,582
This…

8
00:01:34,162 --> 00:01:36,082
is not…

9
00:01:37,672 --> 00:01:38,672
who you are.

10
00:01:39,252 --> 00:01:40,752
Not who I am?

11
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:43,672
Not like a gentle flower, you mean?

12
00:01:44,842 --> 00:01:46,682
One that is trampled on,

13
00:01:46,762 --> 00:01:50,142
picked when needed,
and discarded when withered?

14
00:01:52,352 --> 00:01:55,182
Rather than withering away as a flower,

15
00:01:56,602 --> 00:01:59,362
I choose the life of a creeping vine.

16
00:02:03,192 --> 00:02:06,032
I will not leave my palace.

17
00:02:47,452 --> 00:02:49,492
I must speak to the wicked monk.

18
00:02:52,782 --> 00:02:54,662
Is he still there?

19
00:02:57,582 --> 00:02:59,922
No one has been allowed to approach him,

20
00:03:00,882 --> 00:03:02,462
so I am sure that he is.

21
00:03:05,802 --> 00:03:07,922
I wish to meet with him discreetly.

22
00:03:10,552 --> 00:03:12,802
Find me a way out of the palace.

23
00:03:17,392 --> 00:03:20,352
The Queen Dowager
has just left the palace.

24
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,232
Without her bodyguards?

25
00:03:24,322 --> 00:03:26,692
Yes, with just one court lady
and court maid.

26
00:03:28,902 --> 00:03:31,822
Have men escort her, without her knowing.

BLOODY HEART
EPISODE 11

28
00:03:54,642 --> 00:03:55,892
You summoned me, Your Majesty.

29
00:03:55,972 --> 00:03:58,022
We have not talked in a while.

30
00:03:59,232 --> 00:04:00,982
After the rain-calling ceremony,

31
00:04:01,062 --> 00:04:02,852
I am to visit the former King's grave.

32
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,902
While I am away,

33
00:04:05,442 --> 00:04:09,442
I leave you in charge
of guarding the palace.

34
00:04:09,532 --> 00:04:10,652
Your Majesty,

35
00:04:11,612 --> 00:04:14,162
that duty usually falls upon
the king's father-in-law.

36
00:04:14,242 --> 00:04:17,032
I am baffled as to why
you are giving me the honor.

37
00:04:17,122 --> 00:04:20,912
Currently, you are
my one and only father-in-law.

38
00:04:22,752 --> 00:04:24,462
I am blessed by your boundless generosity.

39
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:29,592
I am aware

40
00:04:30,342 --> 00:04:32,722
of the heartache I have caused Lady Cho.

41
00:04:33,342 --> 00:04:35,182
A monarch has no shame.

42
00:04:35,762 --> 00:04:37,432
Please do not speak of such atrocity.

43
00:04:37,512 --> 00:04:39,222
In no way

44
00:04:40,392 --> 00:04:41,682
will I mistreat Lady Cho.

45
00:04:41,772 --> 00:04:43,772
Matters of the Internal Court
are for Consort Park to decide,

46
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:46,652
so please refrain from saying as such.

47
00:04:47,942 --> 00:04:49,022
Is that why…

48
00:04:51,112 --> 00:04:52,992
you tried to have her killed?

49
00:04:57,242 --> 00:04:58,242
Am I right?

50
00:05:05,252 --> 00:05:06,422
I…

51
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:09,752
am only speculating,

52
00:05:11,172 --> 00:05:12,302
so do not misunderstand.

53
00:05:13,052 --> 00:05:14,932
When Consort Park was attacked,

54
00:05:15,012 --> 00:05:17,052
Lady Cho's court maid was present.

55
00:05:17,142 --> 00:05:20,062
Why would I possibly doubt
you and Lady Cho

56
00:05:20,642 --> 00:05:24,192
when I am fully aware
of where your loyalty lies?

57
00:05:41,162 --> 00:05:44,252
The father is responsible
for his daughter's misconduct.

58
00:05:44,332 --> 00:05:46,212
Please reprimand her foolish decision

59
00:05:47,752 --> 00:05:50,252
and generously show her mercy.

60
00:05:51,092 --> 00:05:52,302
Was it…

61
00:05:53,592 --> 00:05:54,672
Lady Cho's doing?

62
00:05:57,592 --> 00:06:00,102
She sent assassins after the future Queen.

63
00:06:00,602 --> 00:06:02,472
She should be stripped of her title

64
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,392
and be ordered to drink poison.

65
00:06:04,482 --> 00:06:05,732
It is why

66
00:06:07,062 --> 00:06:08,602
I beg for mercy as her father.

67
00:06:09,232 --> 00:06:11,072
His Majesty will soon uncover the truth.

68
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:14,572
It is why I humbly request
that you show her mercy.

69
00:06:15,612 --> 00:06:17,112
The truth will only be…

70
00:06:17,702 --> 00:06:19,282
a royal scandal.

71
00:06:20,822 --> 00:06:22,582
Are you blackmailing me?

72
00:06:24,542 --> 00:06:26,622
Then let people speak of a royal scandal.

73
00:06:26,712 --> 00:06:29,832
A concubine's jealousy is not something
the country has not seen before.

74
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,002
But a mother-in-law
trying to harm her daughter-in-law…

75
00:06:35,172 --> 00:06:37,132
is an unprecedented royal scandal.

76
00:06:39,722 --> 00:06:43,762
The one who deceived Lady Cho
and sent the assassins

77
00:06:46,102 --> 00:06:47,642
was the Queen Dowager.

78
00:07:22,972 --> 00:07:23,802
Release him.

79
00:07:35,072 --> 00:07:36,532
Is he alive?

80
00:07:36,612 --> 00:07:38,032
It has been over a fortnight.

81
00:07:38,112 --> 00:07:39,782
A mere mortal could not--

82
00:07:39,862 --> 00:07:41,862
But the Maitreya is no mere mortal.

83
00:07:43,032 --> 00:07:44,992
Wake up. Please.

84
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:46,662
Please, wake up.

85
00:07:46,742 --> 00:07:49,002
You promised to grant my heart's desire.

86
00:07:49,712 --> 00:07:52,712
If you are the Maitreya, you are to live.

87
00:07:53,712 --> 00:07:55,252
Wake up!

88
00:08:12,142 --> 00:08:14,192
The skies…

89
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:17,982
answer to you.

90
00:08:19,742 --> 00:08:22,402
Inform me of your heart's desire,

91
00:08:22,662 --> 00:08:24,112
and I will have it…

92
00:08:25,412 --> 00:08:28,042
become your reality.

93
00:08:29,122 --> 00:08:30,252
Are you absolutely sure

94
00:08:31,872 --> 00:08:34,462
you can give me what I want?

95
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:43,342
Consort Park,

96
00:08:43,432 --> 00:08:46,012
Lady Cho's court maid is here.

97
00:08:46,642 --> 00:08:47,602
Let her enter.

98
00:08:57,862 --> 00:08:59,022
Ttonggeum.

99
00:08:59,692 --> 00:09:00,572
Miss.

100
00:09:06,032 --> 00:09:08,082
Let me see you. Were you injured?

101
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:10,622
Terrifying, wasn't it?

102
00:09:12,122 --> 00:09:16,462
You at the brink of death
is what scared me the most.

103
00:09:18,672 --> 00:09:20,212
Do not go anywhere else

104
00:09:20,302 --> 00:09:21,882
and stay at Chaeokdang.

105
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:29,012
Staying beside you
is something I know I can do well.

106
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,772
I will find you a way out of the palace.

107
00:09:33,232 --> 00:09:34,102
No.

108
00:09:35,232 --> 00:09:36,522
I'm not leaving.

109
00:09:37,312 --> 00:09:40,112
Living under your shadow
seems good enough for me.

110
00:09:41,112 --> 00:09:42,942
Life in the palace isn't easy.

111
00:09:43,032 --> 00:09:46,032
But serving the King has to be better

112
00:09:46,112 --> 00:09:48,162
than serving the Minister of War.

113
00:09:48,532 --> 00:09:50,582
The food is different for starters.

114
00:09:52,372 --> 00:09:53,292
Ttonggeum…

115
00:09:55,082 --> 00:09:57,832
Miss, did you know that the court maids

116
00:09:57,922 --> 00:10:00,292
fight over who gets to eat your leftovers?

117
00:10:04,012 --> 00:10:07,552
Whether it's Lady Yeonhee's or yours,

118
00:10:07,632 --> 00:10:10,472
eating leftovers is all the same.

119
00:10:11,512 --> 00:10:14,932
But you always keep the plates clean

120
00:10:15,892 --> 00:10:17,942
since you know
we will be eating the leftovers.

121
00:10:21,772 --> 00:10:23,072
I…

122
00:10:23,612 --> 00:10:26,402
would not mind a lifetime of it.

123
00:10:30,702 --> 00:10:31,992
Miss.

124
00:10:50,592 --> 00:10:52,142
Those who attacked Consort Park.

125
00:10:52,222 --> 00:10:54,182
Are they still not talking?

126
00:10:56,602 --> 00:10:58,062
They are common thugs, Your Majesty.

127
00:10:58,852 --> 00:11:01,312
The harassment of Consort Park
led to an altercation.

128
00:11:01,402 --> 00:11:05,652
It did not seem like
they were aware of her title.

129
00:11:08,152 --> 00:11:09,612
And yet they tried to kill her?

130
00:11:11,322 --> 00:11:12,952
Find out who is behind this attack.

131
00:11:13,032 --> 00:11:14,372
Or maybe I should…

132
00:11:15,452 --> 00:11:16,622
interrogate them myself.

133
00:11:19,872 --> 00:11:21,252
You cannot, Your Majesty.

134
00:11:21,332 --> 00:11:23,712
The court will try to find out
where Consort Park visited

135
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:25,552
while traveling incognito.

136
00:11:36,472 --> 00:11:38,392
Bring me Lady Cho's court maid.

137
00:11:38,482 --> 00:11:39,642
Yes, Your Majesty.

138
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:45,022
Ttonggeum was summoned by the King?

139
00:11:45,112 --> 00:11:48,492
Yes, by His Majesty's orders.

140
00:11:53,622 --> 00:11:55,122
What if

141
00:11:55,912 --> 00:11:58,452
Ttonggeum tells His Majesty
that I was behind it?

142
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:01,582
This is not fair.
You know I am not to blame.

143
00:12:01,672 --> 00:12:04,672
I do, sister. It is why Father
has told you to stay put.

144
00:12:04,752 --> 00:12:08,132
The Queen Dowager deceived me!

145
00:12:09,922 --> 00:12:13,642
His Majesty will believe me
to be a viciously jealous concubine.

146
00:12:14,932 --> 00:12:16,562
Father will handle the situation

147
00:12:17,062 --> 00:12:18,932
and you have been told to behave.

148
00:12:19,022 --> 00:12:20,812
Please do so!

149
00:12:43,832 --> 00:12:44,712
Raise your head.

150
00:12:47,042 --> 00:12:51,552
I have been taught
not to look directly at the King.

151
00:13:08,362 --> 00:13:09,692
It is a royal command.

152
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:25,332
Do you recognize me?

153
00:13:26,122 --> 00:13:27,712
How could a lowly being like myself

154
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:30,632
possible recognize His Majesty?

155
00:13:31,422 --> 00:13:35,342
Who have you told about Consort Park?

156
00:13:36,592 --> 00:13:38,392
I do not follow.

157
00:13:38,972 --> 00:13:41,772
I met her for the first time

158
00:13:41,852 --> 00:13:43,892
after coming to reside at the palace.

159
00:13:45,062 --> 00:13:46,142
Is that so?

160
00:13:48,772 --> 00:13:50,112
What you just said…

161
00:13:51,402 --> 00:13:52,612
is the truth.

162
00:13:54,652 --> 00:13:55,862
One's mouth…

163
00:13:57,322 --> 00:13:58,702
can breathe fire.

164
00:13:58,782 --> 00:13:59,912
One's tongue…

165
00:14:00,992 --> 00:14:02,742
can be the sharpest blade.

166
00:14:02,832 --> 00:14:04,332
Let it be your mantra.

167
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,922
I am much obliged.

168
00:14:08,502 --> 00:14:12,252
Was it Lady Cho who sent
the assassins after Consort Park?

169
00:14:14,762 --> 00:14:18,722
I promised Consort Park
not to interrogate you.

170
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:22,432
Answer me truthfully
so that I can keep my word.

171
00:14:27,812 --> 00:14:29,652
Not speaking on behalf of your master…

172
00:14:31,482 --> 00:14:33,032
is a sign of affirmation.

173
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:34,942
Am I right?

174
00:14:36,032 --> 00:14:38,782
Please… do not show me mercy!

175
00:15:00,302 --> 00:15:01,342
Your Majesty.

176
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:03,722
You must let it go.

177
00:15:03,812 --> 00:15:05,722
Lady Cho tried to harm you.

178
00:15:06,022 --> 00:15:07,732
Her father would have known that.

179
00:15:08,352 --> 00:15:09,692
You still must not act.

180
00:15:09,772 --> 00:15:10,652
Consort Park--

181
00:15:10,732 --> 00:15:12,522
Minister Cho is loyal to you.

182
00:15:22,452 --> 00:15:23,742
Oh, dear.

183
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:31,122
His Majesty is present.

184
00:15:39,882 --> 00:15:41,762
I heard you had fallen ill with a cold.

185
00:15:42,182 --> 00:15:44,012
It is nice to see you feeling better.

186
00:15:44,102 --> 00:15:45,312
To what…

187
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:47,642
do I owe the pleasure?

188
00:15:47,722 --> 00:15:49,892
Must I have a reason to visit the palace

189
00:15:50,142 --> 00:15:51,942
of my beloved lady?

190
00:15:54,402 --> 00:15:55,772
Is it your turn?

191
00:15:56,862 --> 00:15:59,032
Yes, Your Majesty.

192
00:15:59,112 --> 00:16:00,822
You seem to be losing.

193
00:16:07,332 --> 00:16:08,792
You must face the target squarely

194
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:12,672
and let the stick draw an arc.

195
00:16:20,302 --> 00:16:21,472
Minister Cho

196
00:16:22,592 --> 00:16:24,222
is someone I need on my side.

197
00:16:26,642 --> 00:16:28,892
It is why I will cherish you.

198
00:16:33,982 --> 00:16:35,522
So, never…

199
00:16:36,232 --> 00:16:38,152
will you endanger Consort Park again.

200
00:16:39,692 --> 00:16:43,322
You answer to Consort Park,
and Consort Park…

201
00:16:45,162 --> 00:16:46,372
is your master.

202
00:16:48,122 --> 00:16:50,042
Causing her any harm…

203
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:54,792
will be treason.

204
00:16:56,332 --> 00:16:58,502
Go and await Consort Park's reprimand.

205
00:17:22,032 --> 00:17:23,992
I informed Consort Park that the assassins

206
00:17:24,402 --> 00:17:25,952
were sent by the Queen Dowager.

207
00:17:27,032 --> 00:17:29,662
She does not intend to inform His Majesty,

208
00:17:29,742 --> 00:17:31,162
but maybe

209
00:17:32,162 --> 00:17:34,212
you should convince her
before this gets out of hand.

210
00:17:50,932 --> 00:17:52,472
The Queen Dowager

211
00:17:52,562 --> 00:17:55,732
must see me as a daughter-in-law
who covets the royal family's wealth.

212
00:17:55,812 --> 00:18:00,272
Why else would she try to have me killed
knowing that I am your niece?

213
00:18:02,072 --> 00:18:03,862
Does His Majesty know?

214
00:18:10,912 --> 00:18:12,082
What should I do?

215
00:18:12,832 --> 00:18:13,832
Should I tell him?

216
00:18:13,912 --> 00:18:17,752
Then it will have to include
Lady Cho's involvement as well.

217
00:18:18,382 --> 00:18:19,832
However,

218
00:18:19,922 --> 00:18:23,052
His Majesty cannot afford
to lose Minister Cho and his daughter.

219
00:18:23,132 --> 00:18:24,212
That is right.

220
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:27,932
It is why the Queen Dowager
took advantage of Lady Cho.

221
00:18:28,802 --> 00:18:31,472
Nevertheless,
I cannot let the incident slide.

222
00:18:33,062 --> 00:18:36,352
She is the Queen Dowager.
His Majesty's mother.

223
00:18:37,102 --> 00:18:38,732
Even if the truth is uncovered,

224
00:18:39,312 --> 00:18:42,022
punishing a mother
is a sin against the skies.

225
00:18:42,112 --> 00:18:44,692
A mother-in-law tried to have
her daughter-in-law killed.

226
00:18:45,652 --> 00:18:47,242
Which is a royal scandal.

227
00:18:50,322 --> 00:18:51,282
Please let it rest.

228
00:18:54,332 --> 00:18:55,702
The scandal coming to light

229
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:58,082
will justify him sinning
against the skies.

230
00:18:59,042 --> 00:19:01,582
I will have her prestige reduced

231
00:19:01,672 --> 00:19:04,962
as a compensation
for my near-death experience.

232
00:19:11,432 --> 00:19:12,602
I plan on retiring…

233
00:19:13,682 --> 00:19:15,222
to the countryside.

234
00:19:17,602 --> 00:19:19,982
My migrating to the countryside
due to an illness

235
00:19:20,062 --> 00:19:23,322
will surely be enough of a compensation.

236
00:19:25,072 --> 00:19:28,532
Even without you present,
your influence will reach the officials.

237
00:19:35,912 --> 00:19:38,412
It will buy His Majesty time
to spread his wings.

238
00:19:40,622 --> 00:19:44,042
What he will do in my absence

239
00:19:45,172 --> 00:19:46,802
has me just as curious.

240
00:19:48,842 --> 00:19:50,972
And with that,
the Queen Dowager's involvement

241
00:19:52,722 --> 00:19:54,052
will remain buried.

242
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:04,232
You must bury it.

243
00:20:08,942 --> 00:20:09,992
Yes, Lady Choi.

244
00:20:10,072 --> 00:20:12,032
I will behave.

245
00:20:21,922 --> 00:20:22,792
No, Lady Cho.

246
00:20:23,382 --> 00:20:26,172
A servant can only be punished
by the master he or she serves.

247
00:20:26,252 --> 00:20:28,052
How is she Consort Park's court maid?

248
00:20:29,092 --> 00:20:30,802
She belongs to my family!

249
00:20:32,842 --> 00:20:34,642
At this moment, she is under my care.

250
00:20:46,482 --> 00:20:48,612
You still have not learned to behave.

251
00:20:49,652 --> 00:20:53,532
It was the Queen Dowager, not me.

252
00:20:54,112 --> 00:20:56,072
No one can blame the lady of rank,

253
00:20:57,082 --> 00:20:58,702
so it all falls on me instead.

254
00:21:00,202 --> 00:21:01,412
Speak less

255
00:21:02,412 --> 00:21:03,422
and hide your emotions.

256
00:21:04,122 --> 00:21:05,922
That will protect you from being used.

257
00:21:06,002 --> 00:21:10,802
Only then, will you and your family
make it through alive.

258
00:21:13,012 --> 00:21:14,682
Ttonggeum is now under my care.

259
00:21:14,762 --> 00:21:16,432
She is not to be touched.

260
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:38,802
Your Majesty, you ought
to retreat to your chambers.

261
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:41,262
The question for the special examination

262
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:43,182
seems to be impossible to answer.

263
00:21:48,602 --> 00:21:49,722
Namsang!

264
00:21:50,682 --> 00:21:52,142
How could you do this to me?

265
00:21:52,232 --> 00:21:54,902
Lord Kim, please calm down.

266
00:21:55,442 --> 00:21:56,942
He is still under inspection and--

267
00:21:57,022 --> 00:21:58,232
As if that is needed!

268
00:21:58,862 --> 00:22:01,442
I have seen him cause trouble
in more ways than one.

269
00:22:01,532 --> 00:22:03,242
Report his misconduct
and remove him from office!

270
00:22:03,912 --> 00:22:04,822
No.

271
00:22:04,912 --> 00:22:07,202
There should be a graver punishment.

272
00:22:07,282 --> 00:22:09,292
The full scope of what he did
still remains unknown.

273
00:22:09,372 --> 00:22:10,412
I urge you to calm down.

274
00:22:14,332 --> 00:22:17,422
When that imbecile suggested
that he sides with the Queen Dowager,

275
00:22:18,132 --> 00:22:20,712
I should have sent him someplace far.

276
00:22:23,432 --> 00:22:27,012
I only have myself to blame
for cherishing my youngest boy.

277
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:31,182
How can he be this foolish?

278
00:22:36,402 --> 00:22:37,942
Is it a message from Siwol?

279
00:22:38,022 --> 00:22:39,322
Yes, Your Majesty.

280
00:22:39,822 --> 00:22:43,152
He says it was a question
far too difficult to answer.

281
00:22:44,742 --> 00:22:46,532
If I miss out on this opportunity,

282
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:49,662
I will have to wait
for the stars to align again.

283
00:24:01,402 --> 00:24:04,732
Did I interrupt your sleep?

284
00:24:04,822 --> 00:24:09,032
It was a light sleep
from which I was about to awake.

285
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,582
You should always sleep comfortably.

286
00:24:13,082 --> 00:24:14,372
What about you?

287
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,872
How are you doing?

288
00:24:18,162 --> 00:24:21,132
Should you not rest more
after the scare you had?

289
00:24:21,212 --> 00:24:23,462
I am very much healthy, Your Majesty.

290
00:24:32,432 --> 00:24:33,472
Consort Park,

291
00:24:36,562 --> 00:24:38,392
you must live a long life.

292
00:24:40,022 --> 00:24:42,312
Unscathed…

293
00:24:42,402 --> 00:24:43,942
and healthily.

294
00:24:47,492 --> 00:24:48,992
You must live

295
00:24:49,992 --> 00:24:51,662
for decades to come.

296
00:25:18,272 --> 00:25:19,182
Look over there.

297
00:25:21,232 --> 00:25:23,152
She is the future Queen.

298
00:25:28,822 --> 00:25:30,032
She is…

299
00:25:32,162 --> 00:25:33,782
my wife.

300
00:25:37,992 --> 00:25:39,202
Why are you chuckling?

301
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:42,962
Because you seem smitten, Your Majesty.

302
00:25:45,792 --> 00:25:46,842
Yes.

303
00:25:48,342 --> 00:25:49,672
I guess you are right.

304
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:53,382
For a powerless being like me,

305
00:25:55,222 --> 00:25:56,762
even being smitten is a luxury.

306
00:25:56,852 --> 00:25:59,472
Why do you see yourself as powerless?

307
00:26:00,982 --> 00:26:03,352
You can make anything happen

308
00:26:03,442 --> 00:26:05,192
just by scolding the ways of the world.

309
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:08,362
Scolding the ways of the world

310
00:26:09,362 --> 00:26:10,442
will give me everything?

311
00:26:14,952 --> 00:26:15,992
Yes.

312
00:26:18,122 --> 00:26:20,372
That is the world I will create.

313
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:23,542
And when that day comes,

314
00:26:24,622 --> 00:26:26,132
I will live my life

315
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,132
cherishing my wife and my people.

316
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:42,772
Your Highness, Consort Park is present.

317
00:26:43,692 --> 00:26:44,732
Have her enter.

318
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:53,242
I was hoping to have you over,

319
00:26:53,322 --> 00:26:54,902
but you came to see me first.

320
00:26:56,202 --> 00:26:57,662
I apologize, Your Highness.

321
00:26:58,372 --> 00:26:59,532
Go ahead.

322
00:27:03,962 --> 00:27:05,162
Did you not hear me?

323
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:07,832
One might think

324
00:27:07,922 --> 00:27:10,922
that I served poison in your tea.

325
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:19,722
So you know.

326
00:27:19,802 --> 00:27:21,812
If you are referring to recent events,

327
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:26,022
then I am aware of it, yes.

328
00:27:26,602 --> 00:27:27,442
I see.

329
00:27:30,312 --> 00:27:32,152
So what will your next move be?

330
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,572
Absolutely nothing

331
00:27:35,902 --> 00:27:38,992
since Councilor Park
has already agreed to pay the price.

332
00:27:41,782 --> 00:27:45,582
After resigning,
he will move to the countryside.

333
00:27:48,582 --> 00:27:51,212
To let His Majesty remain a good son,

334
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:53,882
this incident will be buried.

335
00:28:23,032 --> 00:28:25,792
I was right. You are my son indeed.

336
00:28:27,252 --> 00:28:30,002
Do you have any idea
how long I have searched for you?

337
00:28:31,922 --> 00:28:33,342
Dig me out of the hole I'm in.

338
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,212
You know how vicious
gambling house thugs can be.

339
00:28:38,012 --> 00:28:40,682
I severed my worldly ties
when I took the oath.

340
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:42,852
As if that also extends to blood ties.

341
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:45,102
I hear you are the Maitreya.

342
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:47,982
Then, that would make me
the Maitreya's father.

343
00:28:49,272 --> 00:28:51,022
Let me take advantage
of the son I fathered.

344
00:28:51,102 --> 00:28:54,612
Many will offer money and rice
just upon hearing your name.

345
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:02,372
This was said by the father
who sold his eight-year-old to hoodlums.

346
00:29:02,952 --> 00:29:04,582
"He is, at least,
a healthy chunk of meat."

347
00:29:05,372 --> 00:29:06,742
By the looks of it though,

348
00:29:07,582 --> 00:29:09,582
not even that can be said
about you anymore.

349
00:29:44,572 --> 00:29:46,492
An answer has been urged.

350
00:29:47,242 --> 00:29:49,752
She impatiently awaits a date.

351
00:29:50,252 --> 00:29:51,252
Three days.

352
00:29:53,332 --> 00:29:54,422
On the third day from today,

353
00:29:55,592 --> 00:29:57,752
Her Highness' wish shall be granted.

354
00:30:02,682 --> 00:30:04,762
Is it true that you are resigning?

355
00:30:04,842 --> 00:30:07,142
You will leave the office
at this pivotal moment?

356
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:10,982
Nothing will change
even if I leave the Capital.

357
00:30:12,062 --> 00:30:13,482
Once you leave,

358
00:30:15,152 --> 00:30:16,692
how badly will His Majesty treat me?

359
00:30:17,322 --> 00:30:18,612
He will not treat you poorly…

360
00:30:19,782 --> 00:30:21,282
for you are his mother.

361
00:30:21,362 --> 00:30:22,862
What about Consort Park?

362
00:30:24,242 --> 00:30:27,952
Would she let me be
when I unleashed assassins after her?

363
00:30:29,542 --> 00:30:33,462
You have openly announced
that your loyalty lies with her.

364
00:30:35,212 --> 00:30:36,332
Your Highness,

365
00:30:37,842 --> 00:30:43,092
no one would ever dare to harm you.

366
00:30:50,852 --> 00:30:52,562
Please give me three days.

367
00:30:55,192 --> 00:30:57,942
I will have collected
my thoughts until then.

368
00:31:01,822 --> 00:31:02,942
Just three days.

369
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:09,992
<i>Three days.</i>

370
00:31:12,242 --> 00:31:14,662
I wonder why she asked
for three days specifically.

371
00:31:15,002 --> 00:31:16,712
His Majesty will visit his father's grave

372
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,462
after the rain-calling ceremony.

373
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,542
Maybe she ought

374
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,342
to sort things out
during His Majesty's absence.

375
00:32:17,522 --> 00:32:18,562
<i>Lord Park,</i>

376
00:32:19,152 --> 00:32:21,192
<i>the future Queen has finally been named,</i>

377
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,732
<i>but resigning still seems premature.</i>

378
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:28,402
<i>I will refrain from
dissuading you any further</i>

379
00:32:29,112 --> 00:32:31,032
<i>hoping to hear the reason
upon your return.</i>

380
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:53,802
Your Majesty,

381
00:32:53,892 --> 00:32:55,722
to see the rain-calling altar,

382
00:32:55,812 --> 00:32:57,812
you must depart for Sajikdan right away.

383
00:33:06,692 --> 00:33:07,862
My young wicked monk.

384
00:33:10,112 --> 00:33:12,112
Will you truly be able

385
00:33:13,622 --> 00:33:15,282
to grant me what I desire?

386
00:35:10,982 --> 00:35:12,072
We have rain.

387
00:35:12,482 --> 00:35:13,692
It is raining.

388
00:36:13,502 --> 00:36:14,762
What…

389
00:36:14,842 --> 00:36:17,422
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

390
00:36:30,812 --> 00:36:34,532
His Majesty coughed blood and collapsed!

391
00:37:04,262 --> 00:37:06,642
Close all the palace gates this instant!

392
00:37:10,522 --> 00:37:12,232
Until I say otherwise,

393
00:37:13,362 --> 00:37:15,862
no one is to enter or leave the palace.

394
00:37:18,822 --> 00:37:19,902
The drums will be struck.

395
00:37:19,992 --> 00:37:22,322
Except for those guarding the gates,

396
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:24,452
<i>all soldiers on duty will gather</i>

397
00:37:25,492 --> 00:37:26,622
<i>in the main yard.</i>

398
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:31,562
Speak.

399
00:38:32,432 --> 00:38:35,482
The healthy King collapsed
after suddenly coughing blood.

400
00:38:36,062 --> 00:38:37,152
What caused his illness?

401
00:38:37,822 --> 00:38:40,822
His spleen and stomach
are severely damaged.

402
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,742
Is it due to what he ate?

403
00:38:43,742 --> 00:38:45,162
What could he have had?

404
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:46,992
One's spleen…

405
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:52,002
is the organ first affected by poison.

406
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:55,832
Judging by the discoloration
on the silver hairpin in his mouth,

407
00:38:56,462 --> 00:38:58,252
he seems to have consumed poison.

408
00:39:23,532 --> 00:39:25,282
When will he regain his health?

409
00:39:28,702 --> 00:39:31,082
He will be himself again. Will he not?

410
00:39:31,162 --> 00:39:34,042
Please do not show me mercy!

411
00:39:55,432 --> 00:39:56,982
His Majesty…

412
00:39:57,602 --> 00:39:59,612
has yet to regain consciousness.

413
00:40:07,202 --> 00:40:09,622
Then I should go to the King's Palace.

414
00:40:20,422 --> 00:40:21,382
For I am…

415
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:24,512
His Majesty's mother.

416
00:40:40,562 --> 00:40:42,732
<i>As the King has no son,</i>

417
00:40:43,272 --> 00:40:45,322
<i>if he takes his last breath,</i>

418
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,822
<i>the one to select a successor will be…</i>

419
00:41:10,432 --> 00:41:11,552
<i>The Queen Dowager.</i>

420
00:41:54,222 --> 00:41:55,352
Your Majesty.

421
00:41:57,352 --> 00:41:59,062
It is your mother.

422
00:42:01,982 --> 00:42:06,022
<i>Can you truly grant me what I desire?</i>

423
00:42:08,282 --> 00:42:10,782
As the Queen Dowager,
I wish to rule Joseon.

424
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,032
So please

425
00:42:13,662 --> 00:42:14,912
have His Majesty…

426
00:42:15,782 --> 00:42:17,452
Have my son…

427
00:42:20,332 --> 00:42:21,792
take his last breath.

428
00:42:38,184 --> 00:42:40,524
Is it true that His Majesty
consumed poison?

429
00:42:40,604 --> 00:42:41,774
Yes, Your Highness.

430
00:42:41,864 --> 00:42:43,614
The royal physician spoke.

431
00:42:43,694 --> 00:42:44,774
Then tell me.

432
00:42:45,574 --> 00:42:48,154
What did His Majesty consume last?

433
00:42:48,244 --> 00:42:52,164
To honor the skies
before the rain-calling ceremony,

434
00:42:52,244 --> 00:42:54,744
he lowered his food intake
for the past three days.

435
00:42:55,294 --> 00:42:57,624
Since last night,
he did not even drink water.

436
00:42:57,704 --> 00:42:58,794
That is true.

437
00:42:58,874 --> 00:43:02,254
Those who serve at his palace
can testify to that.

438
00:43:02,334 --> 00:43:03,844
How peculiar.

439
00:43:04,504 --> 00:43:06,094
He fasted, you say?

440
00:43:06,174 --> 00:43:07,844
Not even the former King did as such.

441
00:43:08,344 --> 00:43:10,724
But yet, he somehow consumed poison.

442
00:43:11,344 --> 00:43:12,644
Your Highness,

443
00:43:13,094 --> 00:43:15,644
now is not the time
to appraise his actions.

444
00:43:15,724 --> 00:43:19,314
What we have witnessed
is a clear attempt on his life.

445
00:43:20,024 --> 00:43:21,774
An Interrogation Bureau must be installed

446
00:43:21,854 --> 00:43:24,404
to question all those
who serve at his palace

447
00:43:24,484 --> 00:43:27,534
in order to grasp the truth
behind this ordeal.

448
00:43:27,614 --> 00:43:31,654
Those questions will be answered
once His Majesty awakes.

449
00:43:31,744 --> 00:43:34,284
His treatment should be our main focus.

450
00:43:34,954 --> 00:43:35,994
Your Highness…

451
00:43:36,084 --> 00:43:37,414
It almost seems…

452
00:43:39,084 --> 00:43:42,124
like you believe
His Majesty will not wake up,

453
00:43:43,044 --> 00:43:44,294
Councilor Park.

454
00:43:51,634 --> 00:43:53,804
Besides, there are
more urgent matters at hand.

455
00:43:55,684 --> 00:43:58,224
His Majesty collapsed when he has no heir.

456
00:43:58,314 --> 00:44:00,934
The court cannot afford
to have his seat remain unoccupied.

457
00:44:05,024 --> 00:44:06,024
Which is why…

458
00:44:07,024 --> 00:44:11,494
I will act as regent until he awakens.

459
00:44:21,544 --> 00:44:23,214
Never has there been an atrocious incident

460
00:44:23,294 --> 00:44:26,334
where regency was mentioned
while a king lives.

461
00:44:26,424 --> 00:44:29,844
His Majesty may be suffering
from an illness,

462
00:44:30,304 --> 00:44:34,934
but the system is established enough for
the officials to follow out their duties.

463
00:44:35,474 --> 00:44:36,594
Please…

464
00:44:37,394 --> 00:44:39,394
rescind your order.

465
00:44:39,894 --> 00:44:41,434
-Rescind your order.
-Rescind your order.

466
00:44:42,064 --> 00:44:44,644
Then have His Majesty wake up soon.

467
00:44:46,354 --> 00:44:49,404
That way, I will not need
to take his place on the throne.

468
00:45:05,254 --> 00:45:07,504
A regency is outright preposterous.

469
00:45:08,214 --> 00:45:10,634
Only the court may decide
and propose a regency.

470
00:45:10,714 --> 00:45:12,304
How dare she speak of a regency

471
00:45:12,884 --> 00:45:14,724
when His Majesty is still alive?

472
00:45:15,884 --> 00:45:18,224
Once he awakes,
she will be accused of treason.

473
00:45:18,304 --> 00:45:20,434
But the Queen Dowager is adamant.

474
00:45:20,514 --> 00:45:21,894
Our law must be upheld.

475
00:45:23,064 --> 00:45:25,524
It will be over once His Majesty awakes.

476
00:45:25,604 --> 00:45:26,854
Once…

477
00:45:28,234 --> 00:45:29,654
His Majesty awakes.

478
00:45:30,524 --> 00:45:33,034
You must give out this order yourself.

479
00:45:33,114 --> 00:45:37,324
It is not logical for him
to have consumed poison while fasting.

480
00:45:37,414 --> 00:45:40,664
The Interrogation Bureau must question
those serving at his palace--

481
00:45:40,744 --> 00:45:43,124
There is something I heard
when I first came to the palace.

482
00:45:44,704 --> 00:45:48,424
That those within these walls
are your eyes and ears.

483
00:45:50,884 --> 00:45:53,674
Questioning those loyal to you
do not seem pressing to me.

484
00:45:54,134 --> 00:45:56,594
It will only lead
to the conclusion you designed.

485
00:45:56,674 --> 00:45:57,884
Then,

486
00:45:58,894 --> 00:46:02,684
are you willing to accept
the Queen Dowager's regency?

487
00:46:03,474 --> 00:46:06,604
Are you suggesting
I let the court officials take over

488
00:46:07,104 --> 00:46:09,354
while knowing that they answer to you?

489
00:46:10,654 --> 00:46:13,234
It will be you
governing the state instead.

490
00:46:14,824 --> 00:46:18,074
I see that you doubt me.

491
00:46:20,164 --> 00:46:22,664
Then assess your gains and losses.

492
00:46:22,994 --> 00:46:26,584
You are my niece in this court.

493
00:46:41,224 --> 00:46:43,434
A crisis has emerged
and we are without an heir.

494
00:46:43,514 --> 00:46:45,354
The throne cannot be left ungoverned.

495
00:46:45,854 --> 00:46:48,564
My regency is to only
steer us out of these woods,

496
00:46:49,064 --> 00:46:51,694
so have my words delivered
to all subjects.

497
00:46:52,734 --> 00:46:54,524
I will relay your words.

498
00:47:02,454 --> 00:47:03,954
What did Hyekang say?

499
00:47:04,034 --> 00:47:06,244
He advised you to claim regency

500
00:47:06,794 --> 00:47:08,964
and take command of the palace soldiers.

501
00:47:09,624 --> 00:47:10,754
Which means…

502
00:47:11,874 --> 00:47:13,464
I am to challenge the Minister of War.

503
00:47:53,674 --> 00:47:55,294
All adjunct overseers of the court

504
00:47:55,384 --> 00:47:57,004
shall guard the King's Palace

505
00:47:57,094 --> 00:47:59,964
regardless of their original posts.

506
00:48:00,054 --> 00:48:02,344
I humbly accept your order.

507
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:07,104
No court ladies or court maids
are to enter his chambers alone.

508
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:08,224
Yes, Your Highness.

509
00:48:29,204 --> 00:48:31,454
Who am I to trust, Your Majesty?

510
00:48:34,794 --> 00:48:35,884
Or…

511
00:48:38,004 --> 00:48:40,674
am I not supposed to trust anyone?

512
00:49:31,894 --> 00:49:34,024
Why have you brought this to me?

513
00:49:34,734 --> 00:49:36,644
Inside that book,

514
00:49:36,734 --> 00:49:39,694
those who have given me bribes

515
00:49:40,194 --> 00:49:44,034
and those who have offered bribes

516
00:49:44,574 --> 00:49:47,824
are listed in much detail.

517
00:49:48,204 --> 00:49:51,204
Whenever you need someone to summon,

518
00:49:51,784 --> 00:49:53,914
you may find it useful.

519
00:49:55,204 --> 00:49:56,754
I offer it to you.

520
00:49:57,714 --> 00:49:59,334
And what do you wish in return?

521
00:50:02,134 --> 00:50:05,474
Please, Your Highness…

522
00:50:07,224 --> 00:50:11,394
reinstate my title to me.

523
00:50:12,104 --> 00:50:15,024
If I may return to my position
as Chief Eunuch,

524
00:50:15,104 --> 00:50:18,144
I will seize control
of the palace for you.

525
00:50:18,984 --> 00:50:23,524
I will be your lapdog. If you command it,

526
00:50:25,324 --> 00:50:29,704
I will… bite everyone as you please.

527
00:50:36,624 --> 00:50:38,964
I reordain your title,

528
00:50:40,044 --> 00:50:41,004
Chief Eunuch.

529
00:50:44,134 --> 00:50:46,464
Your mercy…

530
00:50:48,804 --> 00:50:50,594
is immeasurable.

531
00:51:47,154 --> 00:51:49,324
She requested a shade
in front of the throne?

532
00:51:50,444 --> 00:51:52,034
She also requested to be dressed in red

533
00:51:52,114 --> 00:51:54,914
which is her claiming
her first day as Regent.

534
00:51:54,994 --> 00:51:55,994
Yes, Your Highness.

535
00:51:57,664 --> 00:52:00,164
Claiming regency
without the court's approval?

536
00:52:01,254 --> 00:52:03,124
It is unprecedented.

537
00:52:40,334 --> 00:52:43,374
A regency without the court's approval?

538
00:52:43,914 --> 00:52:46,294
Never have I heard of such an atrocity.

539
00:52:46,384 --> 00:52:50,004
Why is the Queen Dowager
going against custom and law?

540
00:52:50,094 --> 00:52:52,634
But I wonder
if we should be present at court.

541
00:52:52,724 --> 00:52:54,974
And be accused of treason?

542
00:52:56,474 --> 00:52:59,104
Lord Park, were you not aware
of her erratic decision?

543
00:53:03,024 --> 00:53:05,854
It is unfathomable in every way.

544
00:53:13,744 --> 00:53:14,784
I am here…

545
00:53:18,414 --> 00:53:19,994
to relay word from the King's Palace.

546
00:53:21,994 --> 00:53:24,004
The King's Palace?

547
00:53:24,714 --> 00:53:26,834
Is His Majesty awake?

548
00:54:23,934 --> 00:54:25,524
Please stop.

549
00:54:35,114 --> 00:54:37,364
The King's Path is reserved for a king.

550
00:54:38,454 --> 00:54:40,824
Please do not violate the sacred honor.

551
00:54:40,914 --> 00:54:41,954
Are you telling me

552
00:54:42,954 --> 00:54:44,664
to walk the path reserved for subjects?

553
00:54:44,744 --> 00:54:46,334
That is the law.

554
00:54:49,624 --> 00:54:50,624
The law?

555
00:54:54,804 --> 00:54:56,964
Then I shall have it revised

556
00:54:57,514 --> 00:54:59,264
allowing me to walk the King's Path.

557
00:56:29,394 --> 00:56:33,604
All high and low ranking officials
are present at His Majesty's chambers.

558
00:56:35,154 --> 00:56:39,364
Wherever His Majesty is present
is where the officials will gather.

559
00:56:56,464 --> 00:56:57,794
Your Highness,

560
00:56:57,884 --> 00:57:00,884
what do you hope to acquire
by coveting his power?

561
00:57:03,974 --> 00:57:05,554
Please stop while you can.

562
00:57:06,684 --> 00:57:08,644
Taking further steps

563
00:57:09,644 --> 00:57:11,184
will result in treason.

564
00:57:18,444 --> 00:57:19,524
That…

565
00:57:21,114 --> 00:57:23,034
just gave me a purpose.

566
00:57:26,204 --> 00:57:30,624
That justification
you spent your whole life implementing.

567
00:57:32,044 --> 00:57:33,084
Our law.

568
00:57:34,834 --> 00:57:38,214
Joseon's system
which you risked your life to protect.

569
00:57:40,214 --> 00:57:41,424
I…

570
00:57:45,014 --> 00:57:46,724
will bring down…

571
00:57:49,474 --> 00:57:51,224
your Joseon.

572
00:58:00,444 --> 00:58:03,194
This country is my country.

573
00:58:03,784 --> 00:58:06,614
The country I spent my whole life…

574
00:58:08,534 --> 00:58:10,074
protecting.

575
00:58:13,454 --> 00:58:16,084
No one knows that…

576
00:58:17,874 --> 00:58:19,174
better than you.

577
00:58:22,504 --> 00:58:24,464
If you dare

578
00:58:25,174 --> 00:58:28,884
speak of bringing Joseon down,

579
00:58:28,974 --> 00:58:31,264
even if it is you,

580
00:58:36,604 --> 00:58:38,734
I will…

581
00:58:40,654 --> 00:58:42,864
have you deposed!

582
00:58:56,704 --> 00:58:59,504
Without the title of the King's mother,

583
00:59:00,544 --> 00:59:02,754
you will not have…

584
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:07,264
any power or authority.

585
00:59:10,594 --> 00:59:12,184
You will have me deposed?

586
00:59:18,564 --> 00:59:20,734
In order to do so,

587
00:59:22,234 --> 00:59:24,824
His Majesty needs to be alive.

588
00:59:34,744 --> 00:59:36,124
But I am afraid

589
00:59:37,834 --> 00:59:39,664
he will never open his eyes again.

590
01:00:03,854 --> 01:00:04,984
His Majesty…

591
01:00:06,484 --> 01:00:08,114
has awakened.

592
01:00:19,164 --> 01:00:22,164
BLOODY HEART

593

Translated by Hye-lim Park

594
01:00:43,194 --> 01:00:45,774
Cousin. I need the help
of the Three Offices.

595
01:00:46,404 --> 01:00:49,234
<i>I know someone is working behind her.</i>

596
01:00:49,824 --> 01:00:51,534
<i>Who are you?</i>

597
01:00:51,614 --> 01:00:53,654
<i>Find out more about that monk.</i>

598
01:00:53,744 --> 01:00:57,914
<i>Even Your Highness cannot manage state
affairs without the proper justification.</i>

599
01:00:57,994 --> 01:01:00,454
<i>This is my justification.</i>

600
01:01:00,544 --> 01:01:02,544
<i>If the Queen Dowager
makes an attempt to kill him,</i>

601
01:01:02,624 --> 01:01:04,674
<i>she'll do it quietly
within the palace walls.</i>

602
01:01:05,254 --> 01:01:08,174
<i>I request you to give me approval
to let His Majesty rest out of the palace.</i>

603
01:01:08,254 --> 01:01:09,714
<i>But His Majesty did ingest poison.</i>

604
01:01:09,804 --> 01:01:12,384
<i>Someone must pay for the crime.</i>

605
01:01:12,464 --> 01:01:15,384
<i>This is the perfect time
to get rid of Consort Park.</i>
