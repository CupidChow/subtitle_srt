BLOODY HEART

2
00:00:46,258 --> 00:00:49,218
THE PEOPLE, GROUPS, PLACES, AND INCIDENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE PURELY FICTIONAL

3
00:00:49,308 --> 00:00:51,228
<i>Your Majesty!</i>

4
00:00:51,308 --> 00:00:52,728
You must…

5
00:00:52,808 --> 00:00:53,808
4 YEARS AGO

6
00:00:53,898 --> 00:00:56,148
…dethrone the Crown Prince!

7
00:00:56,228 --> 00:01:01,568
-You must dethrone the Crown Prince!
-You must dethrone the Crown Prince!

8
00:01:01,648 --> 00:01:07,068
-You must dethrone the Crown Prince!
-You must dethrone the Crown Prince!

9
00:01:07,578 --> 00:01:11,498
-You must dethrone the Crown Prince!
-You must dethrone the Crown Prince!

10
00:01:14,418 --> 00:01:18,168
-You must dethrone the Crown Prince!
-You must dethrone the Crown Prince!

11
00:01:21,338 --> 00:01:25,638
-You must dethrone the Crown Prince!
-You must dethrone the Crown Prince!

12
00:01:28,218 --> 00:01:32,848
The recklessness of His Royal Highness
worsens day after day,

13
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:37,688
and his behavior is
starting to break down our customs.

14
00:01:38,688 --> 00:01:41,148
You must dethrone the Crown Prince

15
00:01:41,228 --> 00:01:45,318
and reinstate
the foundation of our nation!

16
00:01:45,398 --> 00:01:47,908
-You must dethrone the Crown Prince
-You must dethrone the Crown Prince

17
00:01:47,988 --> 00:01:51,538
-and reinstate our nation's foundation!
-and reinstate our nation's foundation!

18
00:01:51,618 --> 00:01:54,998
-You must dethrone the Crown Prince
-You must dethrone the Crown Prince

19
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:59,878
-and reinstate our nation's foundation!
-and reinstate our nation's foundation!

20
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:03,708
-You must dethrone the Crown Prince!
-You must dethrone the Crown Prince!

21
00:02:04,838 --> 00:02:08,758
-You must dethrone the Crown Prince!
-You must dethrone the Crown Prince!

22
00:02:15,558 --> 00:02:17,688
Three state councilors
of the State Council,

23
00:02:17,768 --> 00:02:21,688
then even Six Ministries and Three Offices
joined in this protest.

24
00:02:22,648 --> 00:02:25,438
That means the entire Royal Court is
in this together.

25
00:02:40,788 --> 00:02:44,458
I can no longer protect you.

26
00:03:13,578 --> 00:03:14,578
You must…

27
00:03:19,828 --> 00:03:22,998
survive on your own now.

28
00:03:25,758 --> 00:03:27,418
I shall do that.

29
00:03:30,468 --> 00:03:31,928
Even if…

30
00:03:33,758 --> 00:03:36,138
I must rip my limbs out to survive,
I shall survive.

31
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:41,558
-You must dethrone the Crown Prince!
-You must dethrone the Crown Prince!

32
00:03:43,108 --> 00:03:47,358
-You must dethrone the Crown Prince!
-You must dethrone the Crown Prince!

33
00:03:49,198 --> 00:03:52,698
-You must dethrone the Crown Prince!
-You must dethrone the Crown Prince!

34
00:03:54,658 --> 00:03:57,498
-You must dethrone the Crown Prince
-You must dethrone the Crown Prince

35
00:03:57,578 --> 00:04:01,118
-and reinstate our nation's foundation!
-and reinstate our nation's foundation!

36
00:04:01,668 --> 00:04:04,288
-You must dethrone the Crown Prince
-You must dethrone the Crown Prince

37
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:07,838
-and reinstate our nation's foundation!
-and reinstate our nation's foundation!

38
00:04:09,168 --> 00:04:11,718
I'll marry Lady Yoon, just as the Queen

39
00:04:11,798 --> 00:04:13,428
and the Royal Court decided.

40
00:04:15,138 --> 00:04:16,258
Your Royal Highness.

41
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:21,098
a royal marriage is not
something to be dealt with.

42
00:04:22,098 --> 00:04:23,268
In that case,

43
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:26,858
what can I do?

44
00:04:28,188 --> 00:04:32,198
This foolish man does not understand
what His Royal Highness means.

45
00:04:32,658 --> 00:04:34,408
A subject can only give advice,

46
00:04:34,988 --> 00:04:38,988
and every decision is made by His Majesty.

47
00:05:15,068 --> 00:05:16,868
What are you all doing?

48
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:21,448
Do you dare to look down
on His Royal Highness?

49
00:05:29,588 --> 00:05:30,748
Your Royal Highness.

50
00:05:31,338 --> 00:05:34,378
You are the foundation of our nation.

51
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:37,468
How can you bow your head
as our foundation?

52
00:05:38,008 --> 00:05:40,178
How can you kneel down so easily

53
00:05:41,558 --> 00:05:43,428
as our foundation?

54
00:05:44,768 --> 00:05:46,848
The true foundation of Joseon…

55
00:05:49,188 --> 00:05:50,768
are the nobles.

56
00:05:59,448 --> 00:06:00,528
I will not

57
00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:04,288
seek after the royal authority

58
00:06:04,368 --> 00:06:06,038
as the tyrant you deposed did.

59
00:06:06,118 --> 00:06:08,958
I will not hold you in check
just as His Majesty does.

60
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:10,378
I will

61
00:06:11,588 --> 00:06:13,628
respect the words of the subjects
and Three Offices…

62
00:06:17,338 --> 00:06:18,888
as the King.

63
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:22,678
So please,

64
00:06:24,308 --> 00:06:26,518
help me.

65
00:06:47,078 --> 00:06:49,628
BLOODY HEART
EPISODE 1

66
00:08:00,148 --> 00:08:03,158
QUEEN YOON

67
00:08:07,198 --> 00:08:08,748
Your Majesty!

68
00:08:12,418 --> 00:08:13,628
Get the royal physician!

69
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,668
Now! Go!

70
00:08:15,748 --> 00:08:18,758
Your Majesty!

71
00:08:18,838 --> 00:08:20,338
Your Majesty!

72
00:08:25,178 --> 00:08:26,348
Your Majesty.

73
00:08:26,428 --> 00:08:29,598
It has been four years since we waited
for Her Majesty's conception.

74
00:08:29,678 --> 00:08:31,268
You should take in a royal concubine

75
00:08:31,348 --> 00:08:33,058
and have a son in your royal family.

76
00:08:33,148 --> 00:08:36,318
How can you be so impudent
to the young Queen?

77
00:08:36,398 --> 00:08:39,438
She can always conceive a baby,
even today.

78
00:08:39,528 --> 00:08:41,858
Internal Prince,
your loyalty as a subject comes first

79
00:08:41,948 --> 00:08:43,778
before your love for your daughter.

80
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:46,778
Left Minister, you choose to overlook
how His Majesty feels.

81
00:08:46,868 --> 00:08:48,868
That means
your ulterior motive came first!

82
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:52,158
Otherwise, does Left State Councilor
harbor an ulterior motive?

83
00:08:53,418 --> 00:08:54,498
Speak up.

84
00:08:54,578 --> 00:08:56,038
Can you confidently say

85
00:08:56,128 --> 00:08:58,548
this selection was done
without ulterior motives?

86
00:09:13,268 --> 00:09:15,938
A subject can only give advice.

87
00:09:21,108 --> 00:09:22,858
When His Majesty gives an order,

88
00:09:22,948 --> 00:09:25,778
I simply honor and follow it.

89
00:09:28,698 --> 00:09:30,328
If the Queen requests it,

90
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:33,408
I shall allow you
to select a royal concubine.

91
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:04,528
<i>How?</i>

92
00:10:04,608 --> 00:10:06,608
How did you not have any idea

93
00:10:06,698 --> 00:10:09,408
until Her Majesty was
in such dire condition?

94
00:10:09,488 --> 00:10:10,868
Her Majesty said

95
00:10:11,238 --> 00:10:14,998
she must keep clean while she has
the pregnancy talisman on herself

96
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:17,878
-and did not allow me to feel her pulse.
-I don't need excuses.

97
00:10:19,128 --> 00:10:20,878
Who else knows other than you?

98
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:25,008
Nobody knows.
I must relay this to the King's Palace.

99
00:10:25,088 --> 00:10:27,338
What can His Majesty do at this point?

100
00:10:28,678 --> 00:10:31,218
The fate of the Yoon family
depends upon this.

101
00:10:31,308 --> 00:10:32,508
Yes, my lord.

102
00:10:52,158 --> 00:10:55,658
My arrow must have become nervous
with you watching, Left State Councilor.

103
00:10:55,748 --> 00:10:58,998
Everyone knows that
you are an excellent archer, Your Majesty.

104
00:10:59,578 --> 00:11:03,498
I'm only afraid you will
choose to train in martial arts

105
00:11:03,838 --> 00:11:05,088
and neglect your daily lessons.

106
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,508
I'll remember your advice.

107
00:11:08,588 --> 00:11:10,048
It is my honor.

108
00:11:11,218 --> 00:11:14,518
In that case, please allow me
to give you another word of counsel.

109
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:17,268
I understand
you want a son from the Queen.

110
00:11:17,938 --> 00:11:19,898
But as we cannot postpone this any longer,

111
00:11:19,978 --> 00:11:23,478
it's the Queen Dowager's will
for you to select a royal concubine.

112
00:11:24,148 --> 00:11:26,148
I'll try to persuade
the internal prince again--

113
00:11:26,238 --> 00:11:27,318
Your Majesty.

114
00:11:30,068 --> 00:11:31,658
Instead of persuading,

115
00:11:33,738 --> 00:11:35,408
give him an order.

116
00:11:41,418 --> 00:11:42,958
I accept your advice.

117
00:11:47,048 --> 00:11:48,008
Your Majesty.

118
00:11:48,088 --> 00:11:50,468
Eunuch Jung of the Queen's Palace is here.

119
00:11:55,388 --> 00:11:56,518
Your Majesty.

120
00:11:56,718 --> 00:12:00,138
I came to report that I found a site
for a pavilion for Internal Prince.

121
00:12:00,518 --> 00:12:02,268
I wanted to console the internal prince

122
00:12:02,348 --> 00:12:04,938
by demolishing a deserted house
and building a pavilion.

123
00:12:07,938 --> 00:12:09,148
How big is it?

124
00:12:09,238 --> 00:12:12,028
A house of 21 <i>kan</i> will be used
to build it with 4 <i>dan</i> and 4 <i>jum,</i>

125
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:15,408
and a house of 22 <i>kan</i> will become
3 <i>dan</i> and 9 <i>jum.</i>

126
00:12:16,238 --> 00:12:17,448
Proceed.

127
00:12:19,118 --> 00:12:20,458
Yes, Your Majesty.

128
00:12:21,248 --> 00:12:22,708
I must go visit the Queen.

129
00:12:37,928 --> 00:12:38,768
My lord.

130
00:12:40,018 --> 00:12:41,888
This is absolutely urgent.

131
00:12:49,688 --> 00:12:50,688
Your Majesty.

132
00:12:50,778 --> 00:12:53,238
The Queen's Palace is the other way.

133
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,498
CLASSIC OF POETRY

134
00:13:31,068 --> 00:13:33,318
QUEEN DOWAGER CHOI GAYEON

135
00:13:35,158 --> 00:13:36,408
Your Royal Highness.

136
00:13:36,528 --> 00:13:39,368
Internal Prince has been
waiting for half an hour.

137
00:13:39,448 --> 00:13:41,698
Has it been that long already?

138
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,248
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

139
00:13:48,168 --> 00:13:50,838
Let him in
after another quarter of an hour.

140
00:13:59,888 --> 00:14:01,888
Why haven't I heard from my father?

141
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:05,598
How can he leave the Royal Court
even after he heard that I fainted?

142
00:14:06,228 --> 00:14:07,938
The Queen is ill.

143
00:14:08,018 --> 00:14:10,898
It is absurd that
no one has come to visit me!

144
00:14:13,068 --> 00:14:15,778
Internal Prince, what brings you here?

145
00:14:15,858 --> 00:14:18,368
I hear you are deeply concerned
about the future generation

146
00:14:18,448 --> 00:14:20,278
of the royal family.

147
00:14:20,368 --> 00:14:24,248
It was extremely inscrutable
and embarrassing.

148
00:14:25,368 --> 00:14:26,458
Is that so?

149
00:14:27,748 --> 00:14:30,668
I heard you were against a concubine.

150
00:14:31,918 --> 00:14:35,168
How could I go against the Queen Dowager?

151
00:14:35,588 --> 00:14:39,178
However, for the sake of the sickly Queen,

152
00:14:39,258 --> 00:14:42,888
please let me have all authority
over the selection of the concubine.

153
00:14:42,968 --> 00:14:45,228
If you let me,

154
00:14:45,308 --> 00:14:47,978
I will be as faithful to you
as a dog and horse.

155
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:55,438
It looks like

156
00:14:56,648 --> 00:14:58,278
the rumors are true.

157
00:15:23,758 --> 00:15:26,018
Remove the girl
who caused anger to the Queen.

158
00:15:42,158 --> 00:15:43,828
I'm here.

159
00:15:44,868 --> 00:15:46,288
I may be powerless,

160
00:15:46,368 --> 00:15:48,868
but the King is here to visit the Queen.

161
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:52,378
I heard the Royal Court clamored

162
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:55,548
for you to select a concubine
as soon as possible.

163
00:15:56,128 --> 00:15:57,798
My eyes are only on you.

164
00:15:57,878 --> 00:15:59,758
Their clamor is hardly important.

165
00:16:04,638 --> 00:16:05,888
Your Majesty.

166
00:16:07,598 --> 00:16:08,928
I must have hurt you

167
00:16:10,058 --> 00:16:12,728
because I was a queen
who viciously threw temper tantrums.

168
00:16:14,148 --> 00:16:15,518
It's because I was spiteful.

169
00:16:16,398 --> 00:16:19,818
I hated how you tried to have
a girl from an ordinary family

170
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:23,778
as the Crown Princess instead of me.

171
00:16:26,158 --> 00:16:29,788
If that girl had been alive,
I would have had her killed.

172
00:16:31,038 --> 00:16:33,378
That is how much

173
00:16:34,838 --> 00:16:36,588
I am in love with you.

174
00:16:41,928 --> 00:16:43,258
This is…

175
00:16:46,098 --> 00:16:48,428
the first time you said
you loved me, my queen.

176
00:16:51,388 --> 00:16:52,388
In that case,

177
00:16:53,098 --> 00:16:55,188
I'll give you an answer.

178
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,368
My queen.

179
00:17:10,828 --> 00:17:12,458
You'll die soon.

180
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:17,248
The ailment went into her lungs
and she can't be saved, can she?

181
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:20,508
I thought you loved her dearly,

182
00:17:20,588 --> 00:17:23,338
but the first thing you suggested is
that he select a concubine?

183
00:17:23,758 --> 00:17:28,218
Power must be more important to you
than your own bloodline.

184
00:17:30,428 --> 00:17:33,518
That was an awful joke.

185
00:17:35,728 --> 00:17:36,558
Joking…

186
00:17:39,318 --> 00:17:40,978
is what you had said.

187
00:17:43,108 --> 00:17:45,068
If you truly know
what it's like to be in love,

188
00:17:45,908 --> 00:17:49,408
you wouldn't have dared to say the word.

189
00:17:50,788 --> 00:17:52,448
No child in this world

190
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:55,208
would be happy to be loved
by the child of their mother's murderer.

191
00:18:03,338 --> 00:18:06,048
I rose to the throne after marrying you.

192
00:18:08,348 --> 00:18:10,138
Once you die,

193
00:18:12,428 --> 00:18:15,478
I'll be able to marry a family
that can become my support.

194
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:20,608
As you are now, my queen…

195
00:18:23,488 --> 00:18:25,448
you are dearest to me.

196
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:40,708
Your Majesty…

197
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:46,048
Left State Councilor,
give me one more chance.

198
00:18:46,628 --> 00:18:48,548
My lord!

199
00:18:49,138 --> 00:18:50,428
My lord!

200
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:55,678
Internal Prince will be dismissed
for deceiving His Majesty,

201
00:18:56,688 --> 00:19:00,518
and he'll be severely punished
according to the crimes he committed.

202
00:19:01,188 --> 00:19:03,438
-Your order is our command.
-Your order is our command.

203
00:19:10,028 --> 00:19:13,618
Your Royal Highness,
His Majesty must not know

204
00:19:13,698 --> 00:19:15,828
until another royal physician
diagnoses her ailment.

205
00:19:15,908 --> 00:19:17,828
Of course, he doesn't know.

206
00:19:19,498 --> 00:19:22,538
<i>Everyone, from the Chief Eunuch
to the court lady at the Queen's service,</i>

207
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,248
<i>and even the maids,</i>

208
00:19:25,048 --> 00:19:26,918
<i>are your eyes and ears.</i>

209
00:19:31,008 --> 00:19:33,558
<i>We may even control His Majesty's breaths.</i>

210
00:19:34,968 --> 00:19:38,268
<i>How would he find out
unless you allow him to know?</i>

211
00:19:41,898 --> 00:19:43,268
Your Majesty the Queen!

212
00:19:45,478 --> 00:19:47,398
Your Majesty the Queen!

213
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:03,878
Careful.

214
00:20:11,178 --> 00:20:12,338
All right.

215
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:21,518
BAMBOO GROVE VILLAGE

216
00:20:21,598 --> 00:20:23,518
-Let's go.
-Okay.

217
00:20:24,228 --> 00:20:27,398
-Come on. Careful.
-My goodness.

218
00:20:27,528 --> 00:20:31,148
-Why are you all in a hurry?
-Oh my, Jinsa Lim.

219
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:34,568
A young master from Imjin Valley

220
00:20:34,658 --> 00:20:38,038
came to ask for our young lady's hand.

221
00:20:38,118 --> 00:20:40,538
We turned him down
through the matchmaker twice,

222
00:20:40,618 --> 00:20:42,868
then he showed up himself.

223
00:20:43,538 --> 00:20:45,288
He must be infatuated with her.

224
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:47,498
It'll feel so empty once she gets married.

225
00:20:47,588 --> 00:20:50,168
Our sadness isn't the problem.

226
00:20:50,338 --> 00:20:54,468
We should let our young lady
ride the flowery wedding litter.

227
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:56,758
Don't get ahead of yourself.

228
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:04,938
My… My la…

229
00:21:05,018 --> 00:21:08,268
My lady, please marry me.

230
00:21:08,358 --> 00:21:10,398
I'll take first place
in the state examination

231
00:21:10,488 --> 00:21:12,778
and turn you into the wife
of a senior official.

232
00:21:12,858 --> 00:21:15,198
Even if you're in love with another man,

233
00:21:15,278 --> 00:21:17,368
it's all right.

234
00:21:17,448 --> 00:21:19,788
I'll wait.

235
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:23,248
That smells nice.

236
00:21:25,288 --> 00:21:28,168
Gosh, the wait is tormenting.

237
00:22:01,288 --> 00:22:02,158
My goodness!

238
00:22:08,788 --> 00:22:09,748
Good grief.

239
00:22:12,048 --> 00:22:13,588
I'm sorry, my lord.

240
00:22:15,048 --> 00:22:16,508
I'm quite late.

241
00:22:23,808 --> 00:22:27,898
No. I'm just grateful that you came.

242
00:22:27,978 --> 00:22:30,648
I didn't realize I'd be so late
after visiting the government office.

243
00:22:30,728 --> 00:22:33,648
The government office?
What business does a girl have there?

244
00:22:33,738 --> 00:22:35,948
To donate my workshop to the village.

245
00:22:36,028 --> 00:22:37,068
Why…

246
00:22:38,698 --> 00:22:40,448
Why would you donate that?

247
00:22:40,528 --> 00:22:42,538
I get that all of Jeolla knows
you made a fortune

248
00:22:42,618 --> 00:22:44,498
in the bamboo box business, but--

249
00:22:44,578 --> 00:22:48,748
I already split up the profit
with the crafters, so I have nothing.

250
00:22:49,538 --> 00:22:50,668
Are you saying…

251
00:22:52,878 --> 00:22:54,048
you're penniless?

252
00:22:54,628 --> 00:22:55,588
Yes.

253
00:22:57,928 --> 00:22:58,968
Didn't you know?

254
00:22:59,548 --> 00:23:02,008
I've never seen such an idiotic girl!

255
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:04,518
Why would you give away that much money?

256
00:23:04,598 --> 00:23:07,308
I already promised
I'd send silver to Hanyang!

257
00:23:07,388 --> 00:23:09,898
What now? How will you patch this up?

258
00:23:09,978 --> 00:23:12,068
-Darn it.
-Young master.

259
00:23:12,148 --> 00:23:15,188
You'll get in serious trouble
if you hurt me in Bamboo Grove Village.

260
00:23:15,278 --> 00:23:18,818
Is that so? How dare you lie to me?

261
00:23:21,118 --> 00:23:22,698
Look at this girl.

262
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:25,448
Oh my.

263
00:23:25,538 --> 00:23:27,618
You shouldn't be doing this here.

264
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:30,458
You! How dare you lay a hand on her?

265
00:23:30,538 --> 00:23:32,288
Why would you talk it out?

266
00:23:32,418 --> 00:23:33,918
Our language is

267
00:23:35,298 --> 00:23:36,668
this club.

268
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:39,128
How dare you try to hurt a nobleman…

269
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:41,428
My goodness, this young master

270
00:23:41,508 --> 00:23:44,098
-just hit me on the head!
-My goodness.

271
00:23:44,178 --> 00:23:46,098
-My gosh.
-I didn't hit your head.

272
00:23:46,978 --> 00:23:49,138
Oh my, this young master
just hit me in the stomach!

273
00:23:49,228 --> 00:23:50,808
-I didn't hit your stomach.
-I saw it myself.

274
00:23:50,898 --> 00:23:54,228
Oh my, this young master is
now about to break my arm!

275
00:23:54,318 --> 00:23:57,108
-What now?
-Enough! You need to stop.

276
00:23:57,188 --> 00:23:59,148
Okay, I'm leaving.

277
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:00,658
I'll leave.

278
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:03,698
-Look at him go.
-Oh my.

279
00:24:03,778 --> 00:24:06,368
That young master is running away!

280
00:24:06,448 --> 00:24:07,368
Look at that jerk.

281
00:24:07,498 --> 00:24:10,458
-Are you all right, my lady?
-Are you okay?

282
00:24:10,538 --> 00:24:11,668
-Yes.
-My gosh.

283
00:24:11,748 --> 00:24:13,038
I'm absolutely fine.

284
00:24:13,128 --> 00:24:15,168
-That's good.
-What about your stomach?

285
00:24:15,248 --> 00:24:16,248
I'm fine.

286
00:24:16,918 --> 00:24:18,628
He's fine. He's quite sturdy.

287
00:24:20,048 --> 00:24:21,088
What a relief.

288
00:24:24,178 --> 00:24:27,308
After the national funeral,
there will be a marriage ban.

289
00:24:27,388 --> 00:24:29,678
The noblemen who marry off
their daughters before the ban

290
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:31,308
and the ones who wait for the ban will

291
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:33,478
all require bamboo boxes for dowries.

292
00:24:34,518 --> 00:24:37,648
Send someone to Hanyang
and get a list of such people.

293
00:24:37,728 --> 00:24:38,858
-Yes.
-Yes.

294
00:24:40,148 --> 00:24:41,608
Everyone, hurry.

295
00:24:41,698 --> 00:24:44,198
I must leave for Hanyang
before the marriage ban is instated.

296
00:24:44,278 --> 00:24:47,538
I'll return with a huge profit,
so look forward to it.

297
00:24:47,618 --> 00:24:50,828
Sounds great.
Get us some powder when you come.

298
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:53,118
And some <i>yeot</i> from Hanyang.

299
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:55,128
My kids love that.

300
00:24:55,208 --> 00:24:56,958
Okay, I'll get some powder, some <i>yeot,</i>

301
00:24:57,048 --> 00:24:59,008
and even abduct a scholar to marry.

302
00:25:00,258 --> 00:25:01,418
Oh my.

303
00:25:01,508 --> 00:25:04,468
So you really do have
a scholar you like in Hanyang.

304
00:25:04,548 --> 00:25:05,798
Of course.

305
00:25:05,888 --> 00:25:09,138
I'll make sure to abduct him this time,
so look forward to meeting him.

306
00:25:10,178 --> 00:25:11,228
All right.

307
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:13,348
My goodness, her.

308
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:26,448
You never forget to visit me
although I'm your stepmother.

309
00:25:27,028 --> 00:25:28,698
Your devotion to your parents

310
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:31,788
sets an example for everyone.

311
00:25:33,078 --> 00:25:35,668
It is simply my duty as a son.

312
00:25:35,748 --> 00:25:36,828
Have some.

313
00:25:40,378 --> 00:25:41,758
It's not poisoned.

314
00:25:52,388 --> 00:25:53,478
It was a joke.

315
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:56,768
I heard you still have trouble sleeping,

316
00:25:56,848 --> 00:25:58,518
so I prepared chrysanthemum tea.

317
00:26:02,028 --> 00:26:03,898
The Queen died in such vain.

318
00:26:04,488 --> 00:26:06,568
How could you sleep in peace?

319
00:26:09,658 --> 00:26:10,948
Is this the second time?

320
00:26:13,998 --> 00:26:16,418
The Crown Princess died in vain too.

321
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:20,918
I heard that she was

322
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:24,338
burnt beyond recognition.

323
00:26:38,188 --> 00:26:40,568
Allow me to tell you this
since this is a national funeral.

324
00:26:42,818 --> 00:26:46,568
The Queen's Palace
cannot be left vacant for long.

325
00:27:15,888 --> 00:27:17,058
<i>Everyone is</i>

326
00:27:18,058 --> 00:27:19,898
<i>on the Left State Councilor's side.</i>

327
00:27:36,658 --> 00:27:40,168
Your Majesty, the weather is still cold.

328
00:27:41,168 --> 00:27:43,338
I don't think
I'll be falling asleep easily tonight.

329
00:27:44,378 --> 00:27:45,878
I'll sleep at the library.

330
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:48,968
Yes, I will get the place ready.

331
00:28:59,908 --> 00:29:00,868
<i>Your Royal Highness.</i>

332
00:29:01,908 --> 00:29:03,368
<i>Your Royal Highness.</i>

333
00:29:08,958 --> 00:29:10,628
<i>Your Royal Highness.</i>

334
00:29:21,138 --> 00:29:22,438
Your Royal Highness.

335
00:29:22,518 --> 00:29:24,268
7 YEARS AGO

336
00:29:25,688 --> 00:29:27,438
You must return to the palace.

337
00:29:28,018 --> 00:29:28,938
It's my marriage.

338
00:29:29,528 --> 00:29:33,238
I need to see Lady Yoon's looks
and character myself to decide

339
00:29:33,318 --> 00:29:35,158
if she is suitable as a crown princess.

340
00:29:35,238 --> 00:29:37,408
It's not too late
to go back to the palace.

341
00:29:37,488 --> 00:29:39,948
I'll tell the bodyguards
to escort you back.

342
00:29:45,168 --> 00:29:48,458
Young master!

343
00:29:49,458 --> 00:29:50,588
Young master?

344
00:30:22,578 --> 00:30:24,038
Come and take a look!

345
00:30:24,118 --> 00:30:26,668
-Come and look.
-Open for business.

346
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:30,668
Come and get your powder.

347
00:30:34,918 --> 00:30:36,048
Run!

348
00:30:46,888 --> 00:30:48,688
If we just bring you eggs,

349
00:30:48,768 --> 00:30:51,978
you'll really turn them into chicks?
Even without a chicken?

350
00:30:52,068 --> 00:30:54,238
Of course. Put them in there.

351
00:30:56,148 --> 00:30:57,358
Good.

352
00:30:57,448 --> 00:30:58,528
Okay.

353
00:30:58,608 --> 00:31:00,318
That's enough moisture.

354
00:31:00,408 --> 00:31:02,278
Thankfully, the weather is nice.

355
00:31:02,368 --> 00:31:04,368
Don't forget to turn them around
three times a day.

356
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:07,748
Wait just three, four days,
and you'll see chicks here.

357
00:31:08,998 --> 00:31:11,378
A young girl is here
deceiving foolish people.

358
00:31:11,458 --> 00:31:12,748
What has the world come to?

359
00:31:16,048 --> 00:31:17,128
Who are you?

360
00:31:17,218 --> 00:31:21,388
Do you really believe the egg will hatch
without a chicken to brood them?

361
00:31:21,678 --> 00:31:25,808
Yes, once you create a warm,
moist environment as if a hen were there.

362
00:31:25,888 --> 00:31:28,558
I saw the eggs hatch with my own two eyes.

363
00:31:29,938 --> 00:31:31,058
They won't hatch.

364
00:31:31,648 --> 00:31:32,898
They can.

365
00:31:32,978 --> 00:31:36,318
-They can too!
-They can too!

366
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:43,078
-My egg!
-That's my egg!

367
00:31:43,158 --> 00:31:45,038
And now, it really won't hatch.

368
00:31:46,328 --> 00:31:48,828
-My egg is broken.
-Enough!

369
00:31:49,578 --> 00:31:50,708
Instead,

370
00:31:50,788 --> 00:31:53,458
if you promise me that
you won't fall for her deceit again,

371
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:57,338
-I'll give you an egg each.
-The eggs you just broke

372
00:31:57,418 --> 00:31:59,508
weren't just eggs,
but those were to become chickens.

373
00:32:00,928 --> 00:32:02,598
Pay them back with the price of a chicken.

374
00:32:02,678 --> 00:32:06,138
If you want the money,
you can try to catch me.

375
00:32:14,478 --> 00:32:16,108
Giddyup!

376
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:49,728
You can ride a horse?

377
00:32:50,978 --> 00:32:54,358
You followed me all the way here
just to get paid for the chickens?

378
00:32:54,438 --> 00:32:56,318
Those eggs could have taught them

379
00:32:56,398 --> 00:32:58,778
that making an effort today
could make tomorrow better.

380
00:32:59,318 --> 00:33:00,778
That's what you broke.

381
00:33:00,858 --> 00:33:04,908
Do you think I'll fall for some lie
you made up for children?

382
00:33:05,658 --> 00:33:07,368
You'll fall into a swamp
if you go that way.

383
00:33:07,868 --> 00:33:09,498
Another lie.

384
00:33:46,198 --> 00:33:47,488
You weren't lying.

385
00:33:49,158 --> 00:33:50,908
I do not lie.

386
00:34:27,028 --> 00:34:27,988
Over there.

387
00:34:28,568 --> 00:34:31,328
That's where the women come
to ride the swing on the <i>Dano</i> holiday.

388
00:34:31,408 --> 00:34:35,658
I heard that many men come to
see their fiancée before their marriage.

389
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:37,578
It was true.

390
00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:43,878
Then I'll trust that you'll leave
the cost of the chickens at the tavern.

391
00:34:48,758 --> 00:34:52,258
Do you really believe
you can hatch those eggs?

392
00:34:53,848 --> 00:34:56,518
Those kids only want to eat today.

393
00:34:57,018 --> 00:34:59,228
They'll eat the egg
even before it hatches.

394
00:35:01,478 --> 00:35:02,518
But still,

395
00:35:03,898 --> 00:35:06,358
if they regret what they do,
they'll learn something.

396
00:35:06,448 --> 00:35:11,078
Then next time, and the time after that,
they would be a little better.

397
00:35:18,038 --> 00:35:20,828
You are quite ugly.

398
00:35:23,418 --> 00:35:24,878
You're ugly, cheeky,

399
00:35:25,548 --> 00:35:27,298
proud, and even vicious.

400
00:35:27,878 --> 00:35:29,258
You talk a lot and aren't gentle,

401
00:35:29,338 --> 00:35:31,008
so who'll ever marry you?

402
00:35:32,098 --> 00:35:33,428
You're harsh.

403
00:35:33,928 --> 00:35:34,928
That's why…

404
00:35:37,348 --> 00:35:38,598
I'll marry you.

405
00:36:00,788 --> 00:36:02,708
Chase her immediately.

406
00:36:04,088 --> 00:36:05,668
Find out which family she's from,

407
00:36:05,748 --> 00:36:07,918
her mother's family, and their reputation.

408
00:36:11,548 --> 00:36:14,348
-Scholar Yoo Haksoo's daughter?
-Yes.

409
00:36:14,428 --> 00:36:18,098
I will not marry anybody else
other than the daughter from that family.

410
00:36:18,808 --> 00:36:21,188
Don't you know who Scholar Yoo Haksoo is?

411
00:36:21,268 --> 00:36:23,108
He's known as the future of the Sarim.

412
00:36:23,688 --> 00:36:25,318
He's highly respected
in the Sarim faction,

413
00:36:25,398 --> 00:36:27,528
so the officials also keep him in check.

414
00:36:28,188 --> 00:36:29,448
That is why.

415
00:36:31,028 --> 00:36:34,658
We must increase the power of the Sarim
to fight against the officials.

416
00:36:37,078 --> 00:36:38,248
Crown Prince.

417
00:36:39,408 --> 00:36:40,578
Everyone, leave the room.

418
00:36:50,798 --> 00:36:52,008
How can you be so reckless?

419
00:36:52,888 --> 00:36:55,638
I told you that you must
always stay alert in the palace.

420
00:36:56,218 --> 00:36:57,218
I apologize.

421
00:36:57,718 --> 00:36:58,718
However,

422
00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:02,518
you also feel the same way as I do.

423
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:06,228
You couldn't take the daughter
of an official as a crown princess.

424
00:37:07,318 --> 00:37:09,438
That's why you've put off
my marriage until now.

425
00:37:12,198 --> 00:37:13,158
Also,

426
00:37:13,948 --> 00:37:15,698
she really is a good woman.

427
00:37:16,828 --> 00:37:20,158
She's kind and wise,

428
00:37:21,788 --> 00:37:23,328
just as a queen should be.

429
00:37:28,298 --> 00:37:30,298
I understand how you feel.

430
00:37:30,918 --> 00:37:32,928
It's time for your lecture,
so you should go.

431
00:37:59,618 --> 00:38:00,538
Your Majesty.

432
00:38:01,538 --> 00:38:03,158
The Crown Prince is right.

433
00:38:04,418 --> 00:38:05,618
I know.

434
00:38:06,668 --> 00:38:08,538
But I am still afraid.

435
00:38:09,378 --> 00:38:12,088
I was enthroned
by the selection of the officials

436
00:38:12,168 --> 00:38:13,918
who deposed my older brother.

437
00:38:14,008 --> 00:38:17,338
If I get the Sarim involved
to keep the officials in check,

438
00:38:18,048 --> 00:38:20,058
how will they respond?

439
00:38:22,678 --> 00:38:24,638
On the day of their uprising,

440
00:38:25,808 --> 00:38:27,398
my family was annihilated

441
00:38:27,478 --> 00:38:29,938
as the closest people
of the dethroned king.

442
00:38:30,518 --> 00:38:32,528
They gave you pressure to throw me out,

443
00:38:32,608 --> 00:38:34,778
that they wouldn't serve a queen
from a traitor's family.

444
00:38:36,358 --> 00:38:40,658
But you overcame that pressure,
putting your life at stake.

445
00:38:47,828 --> 00:38:49,668
I am your husband.

446
00:38:50,248 --> 00:38:52,418
If I'm unable to protect my own wife,

447
00:38:53,008 --> 00:38:54,838
how could I keep this nation together?

448
00:38:57,548 --> 00:39:00,258
In that case, trust the Crown Prince.

449
00:39:01,308 --> 00:39:03,138
He's your successor.

450
00:39:19,108 --> 00:39:20,618
"Get the Sarim involved

451
00:39:21,618 --> 00:39:23,908
to keep the officials
of the coup in check."

452
00:39:26,038 --> 00:39:27,498
That's what

453
00:39:29,248 --> 00:39:30,878
the Crown Prince said?

454
00:39:52,688 --> 00:39:53,768
Your Majesty.

455
00:39:54,438 --> 00:39:58,148
I, Scholar Yoo Haksoo,
have come to your call.

456
00:39:59,948 --> 00:40:02,448
I'd like to ask for your help.

457
00:40:07,288 --> 00:40:10,708
I will lay down my life
to carry out your order, Your Majesty.

458
00:40:24,468 --> 00:40:27,308
I'd like to have your daughter
as the Crown Princess.

459
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,668
You're home.

460
00:40:55,538 --> 00:40:56,998
You're here, Father.

461
00:41:02,508 --> 00:41:04,178
EXPANDED MEANING OF THE GREAT LEARNING

462
00:41:06,718 --> 00:41:10,388
My dear, can you fetch me
a bowl of honey water?

463
00:41:10,928 --> 00:41:11,978
Of course.

464
00:41:27,828 --> 00:41:29,658
Someone asked for your hand.

465
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:32,868
I guess there was a family
that hasn't heard of me.

466
00:41:34,288 --> 00:41:37,128
It would be the biggest honor, but also…

467
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:41,168
the greatest responsibility.

468
00:41:47,258 --> 00:41:48,558
Is it a royal marriage?

469
00:41:53,388 --> 00:41:54,648
His Majesty is

470
00:41:55,648 --> 00:41:58,518
trying to hold the officials in check
by using the Sarim.

471
00:42:02,818 --> 00:42:04,318
Did you accept it?

472
00:42:05,238 --> 00:42:07,618
I should refuse it as a father,

473
00:42:08,328 --> 00:42:09,528
but as a subject,

474
00:42:12,248 --> 00:42:13,578
I must accept it.

475
00:42:13,658 --> 00:42:16,168
Father, I don't want to live
in the palace.

476
00:42:18,458 --> 00:42:20,338
Were you not astonished

477
00:42:21,048 --> 00:42:24,718
that so many have forgotten the people
were the foundation of our nation?

478
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:29,928
In Joseon, the only place where a woman
can use her studies for her country

479
00:42:30,428 --> 00:42:32,428
is life as the Queen.

480
00:42:35,938 --> 00:42:37,148
I have not seen anyone

481
00:42:38,108 --> 00:42:40,188
who could be a better queen

482
00:42:41,818 --> 00:42:43,318
than you.

483
00:43:40,038 --> 00:43:44,758
If you fancy any of the ladies,
let me know whenever you wish.

484
00:43:44,838 --> 00:43:46,378
I'm not going to meet them.

485
00:43:47,918 --> 00:43:51,258
I want to watch her fall over in shock
on our first night together.

486
00:43:53,178 --> 00:43:55,428
She will most certainly scream.

487
00:44:11,618 --> 00:44:12,568
Please come in.

488
00:44:12,658 --> 00:44:15,488
This is where you'll stay
from now on as the Crown Princess.

489
00:44:20,918 --> 00:44:21,918
All right.

490
00:44:26,668 --> 00:44:29,218
The daughter of Scholar Yoo Haksoo
was selected after all.

491
00:44:29,298 --> 00:44:32,638
This is to hold us in check
by using the Sarim.

492
00:44:33,138 --> 00:44:35,138
I'd rather switch the King

493
00:44:36,388 --> 00:44:38,348
than live to see that happen.

494
00:44:39,138 --> 00:44:41,978
One reformation makes us
contributors to the country,

495
00:44:43,608 --> 00:44:46,188
but two reformations make us traitors.

496
00:44:46,268 --> 00:44:50,318
Then do you suggest
we all lay down our lives?

497
00:44:50,398 --> 00:44:52,238
The Queen is already an enemy,

498
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:54,028
and now the Crown Princess
is with the Sarim!

499
00:44:54,738 --> 00:44:56,158
His Majesty

500
00:44:58,198 --> 00:44:59,908
just gave us a reason.

501
00:45:02,248 --> 00:45:05,838
Queen Shin is the daughter of the subject
of the deposed king we killed,

502
00:45:06,378 --> 00:45:08,298
Shin Heogyeon.

503
00:45:08,708 --> 00:45:13,968
And Scholar Yoo Haksoo
studied with Shin Heogyeon, didn't he?

504
00:45:28,778 --> 00:45:29,898
No…

505
00:45:29,988 --> 00:45:32,068
Why are you taking him?

506
00:45:32,148 --> 00:45:33,448
-Oh no.
-Let's go!

507
00:45:33,528 --> 00:45:35,868
-No, don't take him!
-Move it!

508
00:45:35,948 --> 00:45:36,948
Now!

509
00:46:19,528 --> 00:46:21,788
I, Left State Councilor Park Gyewon,

510
00:46:22,408 --> 00:46:24,458
lay down my office,

511
00:46:26,368 --> 00:46:29,418
lay down my life,
to inform you of this atrocity.

512
00:46:46,808 --> 00:46:48,398
Scholar Yoo Haksoo

513
00:46:49,188 --> 00:46:52,398
abused his influence over the Sarim
to plot treason!

514
00:46:53,068 --> 00:46:55,698
The traitors who sided with him
confessed everything

515
00:46:55,778 --> 00:46:58,948
and his crimes have been
already exposed in detail.

516
00:46:59,488 --> 00:47:01,238
What's more disastrous is

517
00:47:02,288 --> 00:47:04,198
how the traitors singled out the leader…

518
00:47:10,788 --> 00:47:13,458
as Her Majesty the Queen.

519
00:47:21,428 --> 00:47:22,718
<i>The Queen harbored a grudge</i>

520
00:47:22,808 --> 00:47:26,308
<i>for the beheading of her father,
Shin Heogyeon the traitor,</i>

521
00:47:26,388 --> 00:47:29,648
<i>and conspired to murder Your Majesty.</i>

522
00:47:30,808 --> 00:47:34,528
<i>She conspired
with the wicked Scholar Yoo Haksoo</i>

523
00:47:34,608 --> 00:47:37,238
<i>to enthrone the Crown Prince
for her regency.</i>

524
00:47:37,528 --> 00:47:41,658
<i>Everything came into the light
through this incident.</i>

525
00:47:43,618 --> 00:47:44,868
Your Majesty!

526
00:47:45,998 --> 00:47:48,538
Depose the Queen…

527
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:52,788
and expose

528
00:47:54,248 --> 00:47:57,218
every single crime she has committed!

529
00:48:06,348 --> 00:48:07,388
Left State Councilor.

530
00:48:09,228 --> 00:48:10,688
I ask of you.

531
00:48:12,398 --> 00:48:15,278
Please do not dethrone the Queen.

532
00:48:16,648 --> 00:48:17,858
She is

533
00:48:18,948 --> 00:48:20,818
my wife.

534
00:48:22,618 --> 00:48:23,528
Your Majesty.

535
00:48:26,288 --> 00:48:27,868
You cannot bring…

536
00:48:29,958 --> 00:48:32,538
personal feelings into a state matter.

537
00:48:46,718 --> 00:48:49,348
Palace Guards,
imprison Left State Councilor immediately.

538
00:48:49,928 --> 00:48:52,768
He is a sinner who dare slander the Queen!

539
00:48:58,818 --> 00:49:00,648
What are the guards doing?

540
00:49:00,738 --> 00:49:02,778
Why is the commandant standing still?

541
00:49:39,438 --> 00:49:41,608
You'll lay down your offices?

542
00:49:42,738 --> 00:49:45,488
Do you dare to threaten me?

543
00:49:46,448 --> 00:49:47,988
Palace Guards, lift up your swords!

544
00:49:48,738 --> 00:49:50,078
Subjects,

545
00:49:50,578 --> 00:49:53,998
put your hats back on!

546
00:50:22,938 --> 00:50:24,398
Do you regret it?

547
00:50:27,698 --> 00:50:28,698
No.

548
00:50:28,778 --> 00:50:30,488
Unless I chose one of their daughters,

549
00:50:30,578 --> 00:50:33,448
they would have protested
no matter who it was.

550
00:50:34,248 --> 00:50:35,328
You're right.

551
00:50:36,078 --> 00:50:39,248
So make sure you protect
the Crown Princess as her husband.

552
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:43,048
Just as my father did.

553
00:50:45,628 --> 00:50:46,468
Yes.

554
00:50:48,638 --> 00:50:50,508
A husband must protect his wife,

555
00:50:51,808 --> 00:50:55,018
and a mother must protect her children.

556
00:51:01,438 --> 00:51:03,568
Your tea is getting cold.

557
00:51:26,508 --> 00:51:27,548
Tae.

558
00:51:30,638 --> 00:51:31,718
Yes,

559
00:51:32,678 --> 00:51:33,768
Mother?

560
00:51:36,388 --> 00:51:37,478
I just

561
00:51:38,308 --> 00:51:41,688
poisoned your tea.

562
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:53,118
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

563
00:51:56,408 --> 00:51:58,918
I'll give you a reason
to fight against them.

564
00:52:00,708 --> 00:52:04,088
Your Majesty,
please keep the Crown Prince safe.

565
00:52:13,138 --> 00:52:15,348
It's more than how much
you usually took every day.

566
00:52:15,808 --> 00:52:17,138
You'll be sick for a few days.

567
00:52:20,728 --> 00:52:22,938
The Crown Prince of this nation
was almost killed,

568
00:52:23,688 --> 00:52:26,608
so they'll play it safe for a while.

569
00:52:30,738 --> 00:52:32,448
Left State Councilor

570
00:52:33,988 --> 00:52:35,828
won't back down
over such an obvious trick.

571
00:52:37,118 --> 00:52:40,668
He'll try even harder to depose you.

572
00:52:43,168 --> 00:52:44,288
I know.

573
00:52:45,998 --> 00:52:48,838
A few sick days you suffer
won't put an end to this.

574
00:53:05,228 --> 00:53:06,518
Crown Prince.

575
00:53:07,108 --> 00:53:08,108
Your mother

576
00:53:09,488 --> 00:53:11,528
will not become a deposed queen.

577
00:53:12,858 --> 00:53:15,778
I will die as the Queen of this country.

578
00:53:26,378 --> 00:53:27,498
Mother.

579
00:53:33,678 --> 00:53:36,508
I have been poisoned to death

580
00:53:37,058 --> 00:53:38,928
with you, Crown Prince.

581
00:53:39,428 --> 00:53:41,598
Remember that for life…

582
00:53:43,348 --> 00:53:44,848
and make use of it.

583
00:53:46,148 --> 00:53:48,148
The only thing that'll keep you safe

584
00:53:48,228 --> 00:53:50,988
is the sympathy people will have for you

585
00:53:51,568 --> 00:53:53,318
as a child of a poisoned mother.

586
00:55:17,108 --> 00:55:18,868
Is anybody out there?

587
00:55:26,658 --> 00:55:29,328
The Queen and the Crown Prince
were poisoned.

588
00:55:30,628 --> 00:55:32,498
Shut every palace gate!

589
00:55:33,588 --> 00:55:35,838
I will make sure I catch the criminal

590
00:55:37,428 --> 00:55:41,298
and annihilate three generations
to punish them for this crime!

591
00:56:56,458 --> 00:56:58,968
What happened to those

592
00:57:00,508 --> 00:57:02,048
who caused Mother's death?

593
00:57:04,428 --> 00:57:07,308
You must have cut off the limbs
of Left State Councilor and the officials

594
00:57:07,808 --> 00:57:09,928
and wiped out their families too.

595
00:57:10,018 --> 00:57:12,808
I'm sure you had Mother's revenge.

596
00:57:16,188 --> 00:57:17,278
Your Majesty.

597
00:57:17,858 --> 00:57:19,648
Left State Councilor is at your service.

598
00:57:30,248 --> 00:57:32,328
Why is he still in the palace?

599
00:57:35,168 --> 00:57:37,748
He promised to preserve your life.

600
00:57:38,298 --> 00:57:40,718
The Queen of this nation
was poisoned to death.

601
00:57:41,548 --> 00:57:44,008
Why is the cause of this crime
still not punished?

602
00:57:45,218 --> 00:57:47,638
How come nobody took responsibility?

603
00:57:49,968 --> 00:57:51,388
Let the Left State Councilor in.

604
00:57:57,898 --> 00:57:59,028
Your Majesty.

605
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:02,148
Yoo Haksoo, the traitor
who murdered the Queen,

606
00:58:02,238 --> 00:58:06,738
and his family were beheaded,
and their fortune was confiscated.

607
00:58:06,818 --> 00:58:10,788
Please order the punishment
of Yoo Haksoo's daughter.

608
00:58:14,208 --> 00:58:15,828
Left State Councilor!

609
00:58:21,208 --> 00:58:22,588
I'll kill you.

610
00:58:22,668 --> 00:58:24,928
I'll tear you to pieces!

611
00:58:38,728 --> 00:58:40,228
I'll kill you.

612
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:41,938
-I'll kill you!
-Shut his mouth

613
00:58:42,028 --> 00:58:43,608
and lock him in his quarters!

614
00:58:44,278 --> 00:58:46,158
Let go of me. Let go.

615
00:58:59,588 --> 00:59:02,338
Yoo Haksoo's daughter is
the daughter to a traitor.

616
00:59:04,588 --> 00:59:06,968
Behead her tomorrow.

617
00:59:08,138 --> 00:59:09,348
Your order

618
00:59:10,258 --> 00:59:12,308
will be carried out.

619
00:59:22,568 --> 00:59:23,648
Father.

620
00:59:27,238 --> 00:59:28,318
Father.

621
00:59:29,738 --> 00:59:31,078
Father.

622
00:59:33,488 --> 00:59:34,658
-Mother.
-Jung.

623
00:59:40,788 --> 00:59:41,998
Father.

624
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:47,968
-Let's go!
-Father!

625
00:59:51,178 --> 00:59:52,928
Father! Mother!

626
00:59:53,008 --> 00:59:56,308
Mother! Father!

627
00:59:57,138 --> 01:00:00,728
Father! Mother!

628
01:00:07,028 --> 01:00:10,028
TRAITOR YOO HAKSOO

629
01:00:14,448 --> 01:00:17,458
TRAITOR YOO HAKSOO

630
01:00:53,068 --> 01:00:54,578
Please spare

631
01:00:55,198 --> 01:00:56,658
Yoo Haksoo's daughter.

632
01:00:59,708 --> 01:01:02,578
That woman is innocent.

633
01:01:04,078 --> 01:01:05,248
Did the Queen die

634
01:01:06,418 --> 01:01:08,088
because she was guilty?

635
01:01:11,258 --> 01:01:14,258
I lost my wife because I am weak.

636
01:01:15,548 --> 01:01:19,348
Even after losing her,
I have to protect you, Crown Prince.

637
01:01:20,888 --> 01:01:21,728
I am…

638
01:01:24,268 --> 01:01:28,398
a cowardly husband
who looks away from my wife's death.

639
01:01:29,278 --> 01:01:30,398
Are you saying…

640
01:01:33,238 --> 01:01:36,158
I should also become a coward like you?

641
01:01:44,118 --> 01:01:45,748
I cannot do that.

642
01:02:38,968 --> 01:02:43,178
In the palace, there is a secret passage
only known to successors of the throne.

643
01:02:47,058 --> 01:02:50,898
You can go out of the palace
through this passage.

644
01:03:12,378 --> 01:03:13,838
Follow Kyun.

645
01:03:19,548 --> 01:03:20,758
Go

646
01:03:21,388 --> 01:03:23,808
and prove that you are different from me.

647
01:04:31,628 --> 01:04:33,338
When a man with a mask comes,

648
01:04:33,418 --> 01:04:35,418
he'll take you to a safe place.

649
01:04:38,468 --> 01:04:39,588
Once I go there,

650
01:04:42,428 --> 01:04:44,348
will I see my mother and father?

651
01:04:50,848 --> 01:04:51,848
Never mind.

652
01:04:54,148 --> 01:04:55,768
They were beheaded…

653
01:04:58,238 --> 01:05:00,528
because I became the Crown Princess.

654
01:05:05,778 --> 01:05:07,408
But only I survived.

655
01:05:09,998 --> 01:05:12,958
Why didn't you just leave me to die?

656
01:05:28,928 --> 01:05:30,098
Please live.

657
01:05:33,558 --> 01:05:34,768
Because of me,

658
01:05:36,858 --> 01:05:38,478
my mother passed away.

659
01:05:41,948 --> 01:05:42,858
Because of me,

660
01:05:45,738 --> 01:05:47,328
a family was wiped out.

661
01:05:51,118 --> 01:05:52,708
Even so, I will live.

662
01:05:54,078 --> 01:05:55,248
I'll live

663
01:05:56,588 --> 01:05:57,708
and torture

664
01:05:59,548 --> 01:06:04,008
the ones who slaughtered my mother
and those dear to me.

665
01:06:07,928 --> 01:06:09,558
So please, stay alive.

666
01:06:12,138 --> 01:06:13,058
Please.

667
01:06:16,148 --> 01:06:18,068
Please live and endure.

668
01:08:59,348 --> 01:09:00,438
<i>Thank you</i>

669
01:09:01,768 --> 01:09:02,938
<i>for staying alive.</i>

670
01:09:05,018 --> 01:09:06,608
<i>My love who was ruined because of me,</i>

671
01:09:08,778 --> 01:09:10,068
<i>my beloved</i>

672
01:09:11,988 --> 01:09:13,318
<i>Crown Princess.</i>

673
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:25,458
BLOODY HEART

674
01:09:45,938 --> 01:09:48,648
Will you accept this?

675
01:09:48,728 --> 01:09:51,318
<i>Miss, do you really like a man like him?</i>

676
01:09:51,398 --> 01:09:54,408
<i>You said he wouldn't tell you
where he lives and what he does.</i>

677
01:09:54,488 --> 01:09:55,698
<i>Before the marriage ban,</i>

678
01:09:55,778 --> 01:09:58,488
<i>the Queen Dowager and Left State Councilor
will decide on the Queen.</i>

679
01:09:58,578 --> 01:10:02,248
I'm going to select my niece as the Queen.

680
01:10:02,328 --> 01:10:04,878
<i>What shall I do for you?</i>

681
01:10:04,958 --> 01:10:07,418
<i>Why won't you let me meet the scholar?</i>

682
01:10:07,498 --> 01:10:09,208
<i>You don't know who he is.</i>

683
01:10:09,298 --> 01:10:11,758
<i>I've told you, you'll fall in danger
if you get closer to him.</i>

684
01:10:11,838 --> 01:10:12,968
<i>This is the beginning.</i>

685
01:10:14,048 --> 01:10:17,138
<i>I cannot let the niece
of Left State Councilor become the Queen.</i>

686
