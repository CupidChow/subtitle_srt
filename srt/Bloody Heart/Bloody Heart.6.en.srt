BLOODY HEART

2
00:00:46,258 --> 00:00:49,178
THE PEOPLE, GROUPS, PLACES, AND INCIDENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE PURELY FICTIONAL

3
00:01:11,158 --> 00:01:13,408
I went to Lady Park's quarters.

4
00:01:18,788 --> 00:01:20,128
Lady Park…

5
00:01:36,808 --> 00:01:39,108
being Left State Councilor
Park Gyewon's niece

6
00:01:43,148 --> 00:01:44,278
is true.

7
00:01:53,748 --> 00:01:55,408
<i>Being close to you</i>

8
00:01:55,998 --> 00:01:57,828
benefits Councilor Park.

9
00:01:59,288 --> 00:02:01,128
I cannot do that.

10
00:02:03,008 --> 00:02:07,338
As of today, I no longer owe you anything.

11
00:02:11,718 --> 00:02:12,888
You no longer…

12
00:02:14,348 --> 00:02:15,768
owe me anything?

13
00:02:16,808 --> 00:02:21,228
The ruination of your family
has always been a weight on my heart.

14
00:02:42,998 --> 00:02:45,878
This is my last act of generosity!

15
00:02:47,428 --> 00:02:48,628
This will be

16
00:02:50,798 --> 00:02:52,598
the last time I will see you.

17
00:02:53,678 --> 00:02:56,228
I will neglect you and mock you.

18
00:02:56,888 --> 00:02:58,308
I will persecute you.

19
00:03:00,148 --> 00:03:01,558
So…

20
00:03:03,438 --> 00:03:04,608
leave.

21
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:21,458
<i>Although Seo told a lie,</i>

22
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,378
she paid for her crime with death.

23
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:25,878
But Lady Park…

24
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:29,678
committed the crime of jealousy

25
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:32,348
and disrupted the orders of the palace.

26
00:03:32,928 --> 00:03:34,468
Though it is a dreadful sin,

27
00:03:36,058 --> 00:03:37,978
her family has contributed much
to this nation.

28
00:03:38,058 --> 00:03:39,848
So I will punish her as I see fit.

29
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:44,268
Every court lady and maid
who serves Lady Park shall be flogged.

30
00:03:44,648 --> 00:03:46,108
Have it done this instant.

31
00:03:49,068 --> 00:03:51,528
-As you command.
-As you command.

32
00:03:51,608 --> 00:03:54,408
-As you command.
-As you command.

33
00:03:58,498 --> 00:04:00,288
<i>From now on, you are nothing</i>

34
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,418
<i>but Councilor Park's niece to me.</i>

35
00:04:12,178 --> 00:04:14,718
BLOODY HEART
EPISODE 6

36
00:04:17,098 --> 00:04:18,178
One!

37
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:21,478
One!

38
00:04:23,978 --> 00:04:25,018
One!

39
00:04:27,688 --> 00:04:28,688
One!

40
00:04:31,608 --> 00:04:32,738
One!

41
00:04:52,588 --> 00:04:53,468
Your Majesty.

42
00:04:54,798 --> 00:04:56,968
The night wind is quite nippy.

43
00:04:57,558 --> 00:04:59,808
I fear you might catch a cold.

44
00:05:04,728 --> 00:05:06,188
Bring the umbrella!

45
00:05:07,898 --> 00:05:10,898
Your Majesty.
Please take shelter from the rain.

46
00:06:02,078 --> 00:06:03,578
I must get Lady Jeong

47
00:06:05,618 --> 00:06:07,628
out of the palace as soon as possible.

48
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:09,918
But this may be a trap
set by Councilor Park.

49
00:06:09,998 --> 00:06:10,998
I know.

50
00:06:12,298 --> 00:06:13,838
But if she stays,

51
00:06:15,758 --> 00:06:17,678
she will fall in danger.

52
00:06:23,848 --> 00:06:25,808
Find someone trustworthy.

53
00:06:27,938 --> 00:06:29,438
You must find one.

54
00:06:33,148 --> 00:06:35,898
My lady!

55
00:06:36,988 --> 00:06:37,988
Court Lady Choi!

56
00:06:41,948 --> 00:06:44,368
What are you fussing about so early?

57
00:06:44,448 --> 00:06:47,748
This is bad. I cannot find Lady Park.

58
00:06:48,328 --> 00:06:49,498
She's missing?

59
00:06:50,128 --> 00:06:51,788
You don't know where she is?

60
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:52,918
No.

61
00:06:52,998 --> 00:06:55,968
She was seen leaving her chambers alone
earlier this morning.

62
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:59,088
I worry that
she might have jumped into the pond.

63
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:10,518
If everyone jumped into the pond
over such an incident,

64
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:12,858
it would be full of corpses.

65
00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:14,938
My lady.

66
00:07:18,278 --> 00:07:19,448
It's your turn.

67
00:07:23,578 --> 00:07:25,118
Let me see your bottom.

68
00:07:27,158 --> 00:07:28,658
You shouldn't be doing this.

69
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,328
Please keep your dignity.

70
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:33,418
Your wound might get infected.

71
00:07:34,168 --> 00:07:37,418
His Majesty didn't even allow you
to see a physician.

72
00:07:37,508 --> 00:07:39,838
You went through this trouble
on behalf of me,

73
00:07:40,178 --> 00:07:41,548
so I will treat you.

74
00:07:43,888 --> 00:07:46,718
It is only natural
for servants to be punished

75
00:07:46,808 --> 00:07:48,178
on behalf of whom they serve.

76
00:07:49,638 --> 00:07:51,148
Not to me, it isn't.

77
00:07:52,808 --> 00:07:55,018
If you are to serve me, let me treat you.

78
00:07:57,778 --> 00:08:01,778
You seemed deeply disheartened.
I was worried.

79
00:08:02,818 --> 00:08:04,408
Because of His Majesty?

80
00:08:07,448 --> 00:08:09,328
Then you were wrong about me.

81
00:08:14,998 --> 00:08:16,498
Now, don't drag this out.

82
00:08:18,128 --> 00:08:19,918
You need to get your wound treated--

83
00:08:21,048 --> 00:08:23,468
I… I will do it myself.

84
00:08:24,388 --> 00:08:25,348
But…

85
00:08:28,218 --> 00:08:29,678
Please leave me to it.

86
00:08:32,848 --> 00:08:34,728
I haven't seen you so flustered.

87
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:52,118
Did Councilor Park not
come into the palace today either?

88
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:53,868
No, Your Highness.

89
00:08:55,378 --> 00:08:57,088
And there were no messages from him?

90
00:08:58,918 --> 00:08:59,838
No.

91
00:09:03,128 --> 00:09:05,718
I suppose I should leave the palace
for a while.

92
00:09:08,718 --> 00:09:11,138
I will see Councilor Park's wife
before I go.

93
00:09:23,778 --> 00:09:26,318
Your Highness, what is the meaning
of this unexpected trip?

94
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:29,158
The King is giving me
an illness of the mind.

95
00:09:30,158 --> 00:09:32,198
I will be staying at Onyang Palace
for recuperation.

96
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,838
Councilor Park has not come
into the palace in 15 days.

97
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,588
What are you not telling me?

98
00:09:43,008 --> 00:09:45,718
I'm afraid he has a high fever.

99
00:09:48,218 --> 00:09:49,428
I will ask you again.

100
00:09:52,978 --> 00:09:55,388
What is it that you're keeping from me?

101
00:09:56,688 --> 00:09:59,478
I wouldn't dare to keep anything from you.

102
00:10:00,148 --> 00:10:02,068
That is unthinkable.

103
00:10:17,668 --> 00:10:20,038
I plan to appoint young Sarim scholars
to the Three Offices.

104
00:10:20,628 --> 00:10:21,548
Your Majesty.

105
00:10:22,668 --> 00:10:24,918
They were once followers
of traitor Yoo Haksoo.

106
00:10:25,128 --> 00:10:28,428
Their stubborn self-righteousness
will not benefit you either.

107
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:31,678
Have you not held them down
for long enough?

108
00:10:32,638 --> 00:10:34,348
The officials will oppose strongly.

109
00:10:44,148 --> 00:10:45,988
That is why I want you to step up.

110
00:10:46,068 --> 00:10:48,658
Who else could support me?

111
00:10:49,238 --> 00:10:52,988
All I've ever had is the internal prince,
my late mother's family.

112
00:10:54,868 --> 00:10:55,948
Your Majesty.

113
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:00,538
May I make a small request?

114
00:11:10,388 --> 00:11:11,968
Your Majesty, why is it that

115
00:11:12,048 --> 00:11:15,098
you did not stop the Queen Dowager
from leaving for Onyang Palace?

116
00:11:15,968 --> 00:11:17,808
An illness of the mind caused by her son?

117
00:11:17,888 --> 00:11:20,058
That is utterly preposterous.

118
00:11:20,148 --> 00:11:21,808
Even among commoners,

119
00:11:21,898 --> 00:11:24,978
being undutiful to one's parents
is punished by flogging.

120
00:11:25,068 --> 00:11:28,398
Every word you say is absolutely true.

121
00:11:29,448 --> 00:11:33,868
I will have a royal procession
prepared this instant and bring her back.

122
00:11:34,448 --> 00:11:38,328
Get yourselves ready
so we can set out tomorrow.

123
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:44,588
I request that on this royal procession,

124
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,968
please show the entire nation.

125
00:11:49,258 --> 00:11:52,678
Your Majesty. It is no simple matter
to prepare for a royal procession.

126
00:11:52,758 --> 00:11:56,178
Moreover, the people are currently
struggling through a drought.

127
00:11:56,268 --> 00:11:58,558
-If the King marches--
-What then?

128
00:12:00,558 --> 00:12:01,848
Would you rather

129
00:12:03,268 --> 00:12:05,358
make me an undutiful son?

130
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,468
Those in red robes hold the highest ranks.

131
00:12:30,548 --> 00:12:34,178
Those in blue robes hold
the next highest ranks.

132
00:12:34,548 --> 00:12:36,678
Stop looking around, or you will get lost.

133
00:12:36,758 --> 00:12:38,098
Yes, my lady.

134
00:12:38,178 --> 00:12:41,308
Goodness,
I could really get lost in this place.

135
00:12:46,318 --> 00:12:49,188
Ttonggeum is here, Miss.

136
00:12:53,068 --> 00:12:56,698
If you had come into the palace
a bit sooner, I'd take you with me.

137
00:12:57,578 --> 00:12:58,658
It's a shame.

138
00:13:00,748 --> 00:13:04,418
By the way, while everyone is busy
preparing for the royal procession,

139
00:13:04,668 --> 00:13:08,208
there is no way of knowing
what Lady Park is up to.

140
00:13:08,298 --> 00:13:09,878
Aren't you curious?

141
00:13:12,588 --> 00:13:15,258
Of course I am.

142
00:13:15,338 --> 00:13:17,298
I will run out and find out.

143
00:13:17,928 --> 00:13:19,888
Do you think you can do it?

144
00:13:20,468 --> 00:13:22,638
I'm indebted to you
for bringing me into the palace.

145
00:13:22,728 --> 00:13:25,148
That's the least I can do for you.

146
00:13:25,228 --> 00:13:27,148
I am your servant,

147
00:13:27,228 --> 00:13:29,518
and it's my job to scratch your itch.

148
00:13:29,898 --> 00:13:30,898
Go on then.

149
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,688
Oh. Yes, my lady.

150
00:13:40,448 --> 00:13:42,748
If she gets caught,
she will be in serious trouble.

151
00:13:43,248 --> 00:13:45,248
Court Lady Choi is very strict.

152
00:13:45,328 --> 00:13:46,958
She will not show any mercy.

153
00:13:49,168 --> 00:13:51,378
She's your servant from your house
that you hold dear.

154
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:54,418
I fear that it might upset you.

155
00:13:55,428 --> 00:13:58,178
Listen to you. You're being silly.

156
00:14:00,098 --> 00:14:01,968
This is what I brought her here for.

157
00:14:02,058 --> 00:14:05,098
Don't low-lives take pride
in getting hurt for their master?

158
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:10,358
Sure.
And I know every dirty secret of yours.

159
00:14:20,448 --> 00:14:23,538
I heard that the crafters
of Bamboo Grove Village were imprisoned.

160
00:14:34,418 --> 00:14:36,008
If you are doing this for them,

161
00:14:36,088 --> 00:14:38,258
I will find a way to rescue them.

162
00:14:39,508 --> 00:14:43,348
So you must escape
before it gets more dangerous.

163
00:14:43,428 --> 00:14:45,348
If you fall in danger in the palace,

164
00:14:46,058 --> 00:14:48,598
His majesty will do something risky again.

165
00:14:52,108 --> 00:14:55,488
It was never an easy task
to get you out of this place,

166
00:14:56,108 --> 00:14:58,658
but His Majesty is willing
to take all the risks.

167
00:14:59,908 --> 00:15:01,368
So, please…

168
00:15:04,788 --> 00:15:06,038
leave.

169
00:15:11,748 --> 00:15:12,788
Are you certain

170
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,008
you can rescue…

171
00:15:20,008 --> 00:15:21,388
the crafters?

172
00:16:09,138 --> 00:16:10,098
Miss.

173
00:16:15,728 --> 00:16:16,818
Miss.

174
00:16:17,648 --> 00:16:19,108
Miss!

175
00:16:29,658 --> 00:16:31,038
Why are you here?

176
00:16:49,428 --> 00:16:52,098
The Queen Dowager
has left for Onyang Palace.

177
00:16:58,108 --> 00:16:59,648
By herself?

178
00:17:01,148 --> 00:17:02,108
Yes.

179
00:17:04,278 --> 00:17:05,988
Get my horse ready.

180
00:17:46,988 --> 00:17:48,118
Your Highness.

181
00:17:49,488 --> 00:17:51,328
Please return to the palace.

182
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:56,998
His Majesty is deeply repentant
of his undutiful actions.

183
00:18:00,748 --> 00:18:03,758
I suppose people in the village
are making dinner now.

184
00:18:04,838 --> 00:18:06,638
And there must be…

185
00:18:08,678 --> 00:18:11,598
wives who await their husbands
to come home.

186
00:18:14,018 --> 00:18:15,688
I, too,

187
00:18:18,728 --> 00:18:21,018
once thought that
I would live such a simple life.

188
00:18:25,198 --> 00:18:26,318
But…

189
00:18:32,238 --> 00:18:34,868
the man I loved asked me…

190
00:18:38,578 --> 00:18:40,708
to become a royal concubine.

191
00:18:43,758 --> 00:18:47,378
He said he must protect this nation,
even if it takes his most beloved one.

192
00:18:48,508 --> 00:18:50,968
It truly is cruel, is it not?

193
00:18:56,058 --> 00:18:58,308
The King ill-treated me.

194
00:18:58,398 --> 00:19:02,148
He turned the world upside down,
but you remained completely silent.

195
00:19:03,528 --> 00:19:05,068
That matter is already over.

196
00:19:05,148 --> 00:19:06,148
The King…

197
00:19:10,198 --> 00:19:11,948
is not my son.

198
00:19:12,738 --> 00:19:14,998
He probably thinks
I killed his birth mother,

199
00:19:15,078 --> 00:19:17,828
but he pretends to be a good son
not to be censured.

200
00:19:17,908 --> 00:19:19,208
Do you know…

201
00:19:22,038 --> 00:19:24,208
how much he scares me?

202
00:19:31,888 --> 00:19:34,008
There is nothing in this world

203
00:19:35,178 --> 00:19:36,768
that you should be scared of.

204
00:19:37,348 --> 00:19:39,268
Then stop deceiving me
and tell me the truth.

205
00:19:42,188 --> 00:19:44,068
You are my person.

206
00:19:45,608 --> 00:19:47,688
I won't have you lie to me.

207
00:19:50,528 --> 00:19:52,738
I cannot tell you.

208
00:19:55,078 --> 00:19:56,118
Lord.

209
00:19:56,908 --> 00:20:00,118
I hope Your Highness…

210
00:20:02,378 --> 00:20:04,498
will never have to know…

211
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:08,378
any of the dirty and ugly work.

212
00:20:10,968 --> 00:20:12,928
If I could…

213
00:20:14,638 --> 00:20:17,268
I would turn you back into your old self.

214
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:22,728
You'd smile…

215
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:27,398
even at the sight of a flower.

216
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,858
I wish I could do that.

217
00:21:50,108 --> 00:21:51,228
Tell me.

218
00:21:55,198 --> 00:21:57,158
What should I do for you now?

219
00:22:13,548 --> 00:22:16,008
His Majesty enters!

220
00:22:46,618 --> 00:22:47,998
Why are there two litters?

221
00:22:48,078 --> 00:22:51,378
They are for Ladies Cho and Park.

222
00:22:55,838 --> 00:22:57,428
Remove Lady Park's litter.

223
00:23:03,178 --> 00:23:04,468
Is my order but a joke?

224
00:23:05,308 --> 00:23:07,688
I said I will not see Lady Park.

225
00:23:08,268 --> 00:23:09,688
She wants to join the procession

226
00:23:09,768 --> 00:23:11,608
when she's not yet forgiven
for her misconduct.

227
00:23:12,318 --> 00:23:14,028
How outrageous and ridiculous.

228
00:23:15,988 --> 00:23:16,948
Remove it!

229
00:24:35,568 --> 00:24:38,398
Do you resent His Majesty?

230
00:24:39,188 --> 00:24:42,278
Or your rival, Lady Cho?

231
00:24:45,698 --> 00:24:48,118
If you wish to return this humiliation,

232
00:24:48,698 --> 00:24:50,578
become the Queen.

233
00:24:52,118 --> 00:24:54,668
Is that why you put me in this spot?

234
00:24:56,498 --> 00:25:00,588
To tell me to become the Queen
to save myself from such humiliation?

235
00:25:07,058 --> 00:25:08,598
It is the Queen we're talking about.

236
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:11,678
You will not be able to reach it

237
00:25:13,018 --> 00:25:14,768
unless you make up your mind.

238
00:26:13,408 --> 00:26:14,578
Your Majesty!

239
00:26:15,498 --> 00:26:16,708
I apologize.

240
00:26:16,788 --> 00:26:20,288
I touched your belongings
without your permission.

241
00:26:20,878 --> 00:26:22,088
Leave.

242
00:26:22,168 --> 00:26:24,258
Please forgive me.

243
00:26:25,968 --> 00:26:28,008
Now that we're out of the palace,
it felt as though

244
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:31,848
we were an ordinary couple.
I was so happy, and I made a mistake.

245
00:26:35,058 --> 00:26:36,058
No.

246
00:26:36,138 --> 00:26:37,728
I overreacted.

247
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:42,568
That fan must be precious to you.

248
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:50,908
Lady.

249
00:26:56,538 --> 00:26:57,498
Why are you out?

250
00:26:58,288 --> 00:27:00,878
His Majesty must go
another long way tomorrow.

251
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:03,208
He needs his rest.

252
00:27:03,878 --> 00:27:05,628
-Lady.
-I know.

253
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:09,678
Our consummate date was postponed
because of the royal funeral,

254
00:27:10,138 --> 00:27:12,048
and you want me
to consummate with him tonight.

255
00:27:12,638 --> 00:27:16,228
The fate of our family
depends on your pregnancy.

256
00:27:16,308 --> 00:27:17,848
Once you conceive his child,

257
00:27:17,938 --> 00:27:19,898
even the Queen Dowager
won't be able to deny you.

258
00:27:20,648 --> 00:27:21,478
Father.

259
00:27:23,688 --> 00:27:25,648
I have true feelings for His Majesty.

260
00:27:27,528 --> 00:27:29,608
I'd love to have his child
and become the Queen.

261
00:27:30,738 --> 00:27:32,198
But what exceeds that desire

262
00:27:34,078 --> 00:27:35,578
is my affection for him.

263
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:57,848
Mother.

264
00:27:58,768 --> 00:28:02,268
Please forgive me
for being an undutiful son.

265
00:28:15,578 --> 00:28:19,038
Are you trying to make me
the worst stepmother in the world?

266
00:28:20,538 --> 00:28:21,788
Please stand.

267
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:23,958
Until you return,

268
00:28:24,378 --> 00:28:26,378
I will stay here for however long it takes

269
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:28,338
and beg for your forgiveness.

270
00:28:37,218 --> 00:28:38,308
Let's see

271
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,058
if you can really do that.

272
00:28:45,608 --> 00:28:46,728
I can do this

273
00:28:48,148 --> 00:28:49,818
for days if that is what you need.

274
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:52,108
But…

275
00:28:53,528 --> 00:28:55,528
the people that you care about,

276
00:28:57,078 --> 00:28:59,078
including Inspector Park whom you adore,

277
00:29:00,078 --> 00:29:01,868
will have to suffer with me.

278
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:05,498
I fear that it might be
an undutiful act as well.

279
00:29:19,218 --> 00:29:20,978
As it happens,

280
00:29:22,138 --> 00:29:24,018
it will rain heavily tonight.

281
00:29:25,858 --> 00:29:28,978
I, the King of this state,
have come to escort you.

282
00:29:29,898 --> 00:29:32,278
Your standing will soar,
and you will be looked up to.

283
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:34,818
So please return to the palace now.

284
00:30:00,428 --> 00:30:01,518
You are late.

285
00:30:01,598 --> 00:30:03,268
A court lady telling us to come and go.

286
00:30:03,348 --> 00:30:05,518
Does that not bother you?

287
00:30:06,728 --> 00:30:08,518
While we learn about
the royal formalities,

288
00:30:08,608 --> 00:30:10,818
she is our teacher, not just a court lady.

289
00:30:10,898 --> 00:30:14,028
We have our responsibilities
as the holders of second junior rank.

290
00:30:14,108 --> 00:30:17,318
They are things you do not need to learn
if you are to become Queen.

291
00:30:20,328 --> 00:30:22,788
I have no intention of sharing my husband.

292
00:30:26,998 --> 00:30:28,788
Learn to hide your feelings.

293
00:30:29,748 --> 00:30:31,498
I am saying this for your sake.

294
00:30:43,018 --> 00:30:44,388
That fan…

295
00:30:47,018 --> 00:30:48,228
Do you

296
00:30:49,358 --> 00:30:50,608
know this fan?

297
00:30:52,858 --> 00:30:54,778
-It belongs to His Majesty--
-Yes.

298
00:30:54,858 --> 00:30:58,528
He holds it dear,
so I had an identical one made.

299
00:31:02,578 --> 00:31:04,078
Someone precious…

300
00:31:05,998 --> 00:31:07,828
made it for me.

301
00:31:10,708 --> 00:31:13,168
A member of the royal family, you mean?

302
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:15,548
If it's your close relative--

303
00:31:15,628 --> 00:31:17,718
It is someone that I cannot be close to.

304
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:22,638
My feelings, as they grow deeper,

305
00:31:24,678 --> 00:31:26,478
will only be their poison.

306
00:31:31,188 --> 00:31:32,188
What is the matter?

307
00:31:32,898 --> 00:31:34,478
Is this against the rules?

308
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:26,488
Does His Majesty

309
00:32:27,698 --> 00:32:29,458
often go out to the city in disguise?

310
00:32:30,788 --> 00:32:32,628
Why do you ask?

311
00:32:33,538 --> 00:32:35,418
I think I heard people saying

312
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:38,588
that he comes out every 15 days.

313
00:32:38,668 --> 00:32:41,428
It is only a rumor
that those of low birth made up.

314
00:32:42,508 --> 00:32:46,138
If he went out so often,
the entire palace would be in turmoil.

315
00:32:48,348 --> 00:32:49,518
Has there never…

316
00:32:52,188 --> 00:32:53,348
been such a commotion before?

317
00:32:55,108 --> 00:32:57,568
There was a time
shortly after the late king passed away

318
00:32:58,278 --> 00:33:00,858
when he went missing for about an hour.

319
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:04,488
Everyone looked for him in panic.

320
00:33:05,198 --> 00:33:06,408
Was that day--

321
00:33:09,368 --> 00:33:10,578
the 15th?

322
00:33:11,408 --> 00:33:12,918
I cannot be sure,

323
00:33:15,208 --> 00:33:16,418
but I believe so.

324
00:33:45,568 --> 00:33:46,698
My lord--

325
00:34:15,808 --> 00:34:17,518
I'd like to walk alone for a while.

326
00:34:18,808 --> 00:34:20,398
I won't go far.

327
00:34:21,778 --> 00:34:22,938
Please let me.

328
00:34:32,578 --> 00:34:34,288
<i>You cannot come.</i>

329
00:34:34,998 --> 00:34:36,328
<i>I can.</i>

330
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:38,248
I do not want you to!

331
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:42,128
My world is…

332
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:45,758
a place you can't live in.

333
00:36:09,878 --> 00:36:11,178
What is the matter?

334
00:36:15,138 --> 00:36:17,428
Did something bad happen?

335
00:36:20,558 --> 00:36:21,848
You have always

336
00:36:23,808 --> 00:36:25,728
worried about me.

337
00:36:27,898 --> 00:36:29,738
You worried something might happen to me,

338
00:36:32,068 --> 00:36:33,618
or I might be having trouble.

339
00:36:36,538 --> 00:36:38,248
And all the while,

340
00:36:42,958 --> 00:36:44,958
you were stuck in a place

341
00:36:46,378 --> 00:36:48,128
where you can't even cry
whenever you want.

342
00:36:55,048 --> 00:36:56,098
Do you…

343
00:36:59,928 --> 00:37:01,938
still wish me to leave?

344
00:37:10,108 --> 00:37:11,198
I do.

345
00:37:12,028 --> 00:37:13,488
Are you scared…

346
00:37:17,238 --> 00:37:18,578
that I might get hurt?

347
00:37:21,998 --> 00:37:23,618
Do you know

348
00:37:25,458 --> 00:37:27,038
what my father's last words were?

349
00:37:32,838 --> 00:37:33,968
"Tae.

350
00:37:36,098 --> 00:37:37,138
Please…

351
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:41,518
survive."

352
00:37:48,438 --> 00:37:49,568
I…

353
00:37:51,858 --> 00:37:53,988
will honor his words.

354
00:37:55,488 --> 00:37:57,658
I wish I could protect you too,

355
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:02,198
but I can't.

356
00:38:14,218 --> 00:38:15,258
I will leave.

357
00:38:18,298 --> 00:38:21,308
I'll leave the palace, and I will live

358
00:38:22,428 --> 00:38:23,728
with my people

359
00:38:25,388 --> 00:38:26,898
as I have in the past.

360
00:39:09,558 --> 00:39:10,768
You may leave.

361
00:39:12,398 --> 00:39:16,448
The news His Majesty sends
through his eunuch is never good.

362
00:39:36,838 --> 00:39:40,838
His Majesty will soon hold a feast
as an apology

363
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:42,758
to the Queen Dowager.

364
00:39:49,018 --> 00:39:51,688
<i>You must tell her
that you will prepare the fireworks.</i>

365
00:39:53,608 --> 00:39:56,148
I am very much looking forward
to the feast.

366
00:39:56,488 --> 00:40:00,738
Lady Park offered to prepare
the fireworks herself.

367
00:40:01,318 --> 00:40:03,618
Ministry of War and Government Arsenal
will see to it.

368
00:40:04,198 --> 00:40:05,908
What is there for her to do?

369
00:40:06,408 --> 00:40:09,248
I'd like to offer my help,
as little as it may be.

370
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:12,288
Please allow me to enter your library.

371
00:40:13,458 --> 00:40:14,628
I'll allow it.

372
00:40:15,378 --> 00:40:19,678
You may visit the library
when I am not present, but leave no marks.

373
00:40:24,468 --> 00:40:26,558
I am approving this
because my mother asked me to,

374
00:40:27,138 --> 00:40:28,768
but I do not wish to see you.

375
00:40:29,598 --> 00:40:33,478
Cover your face with a black veil
if you want to attend the feast.

376
00:40:38,568 --> 00:40:42,988
<i>Fireworks are the spectacle that
everyone in the palace loves to see.</i>

377
00:40:43,488 --> 00:40:47,078
<i>Even the gatekeepers
will be distracted by them.</i>

378
00:42:07,528 --> 00:42:10,868
<i>That is exactly when
you must escape the palace.</i>

379
00:43:13,218 --> 00:43:16,098
I invited you here, my lord,

380
00:43:16,178 --> 00:43:20,108
to prove to you how useful I can be.

381
00:43:21,148 --> 00:43:24,778
You don't visit me so often these days.

382
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:29,488
It is because Lady Park
hasn't done anything suspicious.

383
00:43:33,698 --> 00:43:35,868
That is not for you to decide.

384
00:43:40,128 --> 00:43:41,668
Who visits her

385
00:43:42,838 --> 00:43:44,248
in her chambers?

386
00:43:44,338 --> 00:43:45,458
No one.

387
00:43:46,798 --> 00:43:50,218
Eunuch Jung came to discuss
the details about the feast, but--

388
00:43:50,298 --> 00:43:51,298
Jung Euikyun?

389
00:43:53,348 --> 00:43:54,638
Jung Euikyun, you say?

390
00:43:56,098 --> 00:43:56,928
Yes.

391
00:44:00,148 --> 00:44:02,898
The only eunuch that His Majesty trusts…

392
00:44:05,108 --> 00:44:06,568
made a move?

393
00:44:13,488 --> 00:44:14,908
Is everything ready?

394
00:44:18,158 --> 00:44:19,498
Yes, Your Majesty.

395
00:44:19,578 --> 00:44:21,628
She only needs to go to the library.

396
00:44:21,708 --> 00:44:24,168
All court ladies will be
tending to the Queen Dowager,

397
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:26,798
so no one will be watching her.

398
00:44:27,958 --> 00:44:31,468
How about the person who will act as her?
Is she trustworthy?

399
00:44:33,048 --> 00:44:34,258
She is…

400
00:44:35,928 --> 00:44:37,098
trustworthy.

401
00:46:41,138 --> 00:46:42,388
Miss!

402
00:46:44,098 --> 00:46:45,188
Ttonggeum.

403
00:46:52,478 --> 00:46:53,778
Why are you here?

404
00:46:53,858 --> 00:46:56,028
I came to rescue you, of course.

405
00:46:58,868 --> 00:47:00,738
<i>I will save those people.</i>

406
00:47:01,158 --> 00:47:03,078
<i>All you need to do is escape.</i>

407
00:47:06,288 --> 00:47:08,378
Why did you come here?

408
00:47:08,958 --> 00:47:11,128
Do you realize what kind of place this is?

409
00:47:12,208 --> 00:47:15,798
How could I even sleep in peace
when you were taken away?

410
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:21,428
Trust me. I will get you out of here soon.

411
00:47:24,598 --> 00:47:28,558
It's dark down here,
so please watch your step.

412
00:47:28,768 --> 00:47:30,898
I dropped my torch
while swinging it around

413
00:47:30,978 --> 00:47:33,148
to get the rats out of your path.

414
00:47:33,568 --> 00:47:37,318
There are many stones here too,
so be careful not to trip over…

415
00:49:29,808 --> 00:49:32,268
It's getting late. Let us hurry.

416
00:49:41,068 --> 00:49:42,278
Have you found Eunuch Jung?

417
00:49:42,948 --> 00:49:44,358
He had a gate pass issued.

418
00:49:44,448 --> 00:49:46,278
He must go out of the palace
to run an errand.

419
00:49:46,368 --> 00:49:48,698
We are looking for him,
so please do not worry.

420
00:49:48,788 --> 00:49:51,498
I wanted to inform the Chief Eunuch,
but he has left the palace too.

421
00:49:51,578 --> 00:49:52,458
And Court Lady Choi?

422
00:49:52,538 --> 00:49:55,288
She is preparing for the feast
and tending to the Queen Dowager.

423
00:49:55,878 --> 00:49:59,498
Is Lady Park
with the Queen Dowager as well then?

424
00:49:59,588 --> 00:50:02,968
She is to stop by at the King's library
and attend the feast after.

425
00:50:25,818 --> 00:50:29,988
We, the people at Chaeokdang,
prepared this

426
00:50:30,078 --> 00:50:32,498
to wish you a long healthy life,
Your Highness.

427
00:50:32,578 --> 00:50:35,458
Please enjoy it.

428
00:52:19,888 --> 00:52:21,098
Hurry.

429
00:52:22,018 --> 00:52:24,358
You must get far away
before the performance ends.

430
00:52:37,288 --> 00:52:41,248
<i>Eunuch Jung's gate pass, fireworks.</i>

431
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:43,078
<i>Veil.</i>

432
00:52:44,458 --> 00:52:45,498
<i>Library.</i>

433
00:52:47,208 --> 00:52:48,628
<i>Library?</i>

434
00:54:33,108 --> 00:54:35,028
Lock every gate in the palace!

435
00:54:35,108 --> 00:54:38,028
Do not let anybody leave the palace!

436
00:55:54,028 --> 00:55:55,028
You may pass.

437
00:56:04,988 --> 00:56:05,998
Lock the gates.

438
00:56:07,368 --> 00:56:09,918
Lock the gates and tighten security!

439
00:56:09,998 --> 00:56:11,038
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

440
00:56:41,408 --> 00:56:42,738
Are you all right?

441
00:56:55,838 --> 00:56:57,048
Step back.

442
00:57:03,508 --> 00:57:05,348
It is such a magnificent sight.

443
00:57:06,758 --> 00:57:08,468
Yes, indeed.

444
00:57:10,558 --> 00:57:12,898
Lady Park must have worked
so hard for this.

445
00:57:19,858 --> 00:57:22,198
To compliment her contribution,

446
00:57:22,278 --> 00:57:25,028
lift her veil yourself.

447
00:57:31,368 --> 00:57:32,498
Your Majesty.

448
00:57:32,578 --> 00:57:34,788
This is a feast held for me.

449
00:57:53,938 --> 00:57:55,938
Lady Park, come forward.

450
00:57:56,268 --> 00:58:00,858
His Majesty wishes to compliment
your hard work himself.

451
00:58:56,288 --> 00:58:58,878
Where are you going, Eunuch Jung?

452
00:59:03,258 --> 00:59:05,878
And who is the lady behind you?

453
00:59:05,968 --> 00:59:07,468
She is Lady Park's court maid.

454
00:59:08,048 --> 00:59:11,388
She was ordered to fetch the tea
for the Queen Dowager tomorrow.

455
00:59:11,468 --> 00:59:13,808
Allow me to check.

456
00:59:15,938 --> 00:59:16,978
Chief Eunuch.

457
00:59:20,478 --> 00:59:22,268
Shall I signal them to fire their arrows?

458
00:59:30,028 --> 00:59:32,198
This is very rude of you.

459
00:59:32,788 --> 00:59:37,078
When I owe someone a favor,
I always return it.

460
00:59:37,668 --> 00:59:38,748
And I owe one

461
00:59:40,078 --> 00:59:42,918
to you and the lady behind you.

462
00:59:45,378 --> 00:59:46,628
What are you waiting for?

463
01:02:33,628 --> 01:02:34,798
Why…

464
01:02:36,758 --> 01:02:38,388
are you here?

465
01:02:51,688 --> 01:02:53,438
<i>Did she not leave?</i>

466
01:02:54,398 --> 01:02:55,398
<i>Or…</i>

467
01:02:56,278 --> 01:02:59,528
<i>did she choose to come back?</i>

468
01:03:04,908 --> 01:03:07,498
I am your concubine.

469
01:03:10,588 --> 01:03:12,918
I will live as your woman.

470
01:03:13,798 --> 01:03:14,838
To do that,

471
01:03:19,548 --> 01:03:21,258
I will become the Queen.

472
01:03:38,608 --> 01:03:40,868
I offer you my congratulations.

473
01:03:47,748 --> 01:03:49,828
Your Highness the Queen.

474
01:04:27,078 --> 01:04:30,078
BLOODY HEART
