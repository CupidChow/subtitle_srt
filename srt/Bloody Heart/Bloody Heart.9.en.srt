00:00:43,218 --> 00:00:47,178
BLOODY HEART

2
00:00:47,258 --> 00:00:50,178
THE PEOPLE, GROUPS, PLACES, AND INCIDENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE PURELY FICTIONAL

3
00:01:30,258 --> 00:01:32,928
<i>Tonight, I will allow you to embrace me.</i>

4
00:02:01,168 --> 00:02:02,668
You came all the way here to see me.

5
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:05,008
That is more than enough for me.

6
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,678
By trying to save me,

7
00:02:16,688 --> 00:02:18,768
you will be saving Councilor Park as well.

8
00:02:22,478 --> 00:02:24,278
I cannot let that happen.

9
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:41,838
You are not

10
00:02:42,498 --> 00:02:44,458
Councilor Park's niece.

11
00:02:44,548 --> 00:02:45,548
You cannot be.

12
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:49,088
I will find a way.

13
00:02:50,218 --> 00:02:51,678
So never…

14
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,178
attempt to die again.

15
00:03:04,108 --> 00:03:05,228
Do not…

16
00:03:06,988 --> 00:03:08,568
leave me alone.

17
00:05:21,198 --> 00:05:23,748
BLOODY HEART
EPISODE 9

18
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:30,498
How could His Majesty do this?

19
00:06:27,138 --> 00:06:30,648
What… are you reading so intently?

20
00:06:43,538 --> 00:06:44,988
I am reading…

21
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:49,078
about the life that your daughter has led.

22
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:55,048
I cannot remember
the last time I felt this powerless.

23
00:06:56,548 --> 00:06:59,128
No one has ever given me
such a huge sense of defeat.

24
00:07:00,548 --> 00:07:03,808
I want to know what I failed to see.

25
00:07:05,388 --> 00:07:07,178
Were you afraid?

26
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:10,598
I was.

27
00:07:10,688 --> 00:07:12,438
Are you having regrets?

28
00:07:13,858 --> 00:07:15,478
I have always lived intentionally

29
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:19,028
so that I would regret nothing.

30
00:07:19,778 --> 00:07:23,738
Nothing mattered more to me than
my loyalty to the King and my parents.

31
00:07:24,488 --> 00:07:27,748
Do you know what made officials like me

32
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:31,828
take up swords and commit treason?

33
00:07:33,878 --> 00:07:35,588
A tyrant.

34
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,378
People were starving in the capital.

35
00:07:39,468 --> 00:07:42,338
They relied on human flesh to survive.

36
00:07:43,138 --> 00:07:47,388
Women were… violated.

37
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:49,388
<i>The heads of my honorable friends</i>

38
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:53,348
<i>were decapitated</i>

39
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:56,018
<i>and displayed.</i>

40
00:07:57,528 --> 00:07:58,988
<i>Every morning,</i>

41
00:08:00,398 --> 00:08:04,368
<i>I had to pass by
the decapitated heads of my friends…</i>

42
00:08:07,448 --> 00:08:09,198
<i>on my way to the palace.</i>

43
00:08:12,668 --> 00:08:16,958
I was determined to prevent
another tyrant from rising.

44
00:08:17,048 --> 00:08:19,548
I committed myself
to foster a wise king by my hands

45
00:08:20,298 --> 00:08:22,798
and build a system

46
00:08:24,388 --> 00:08:26,098
to keep him and his power in check.

47
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:31,098
That is why I had to take that path.

48
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,388
I had to!

49
00:08:33,898 --> 00:08:37,568
I knew I would be covered in blood

50
00:08:37,648 --> 00:08:41,028
and condemned for generations.

51
00:08:41,108 --> 00:08:42,148
But I…

52
00:08:45,198 --> 00:08:46,238
I had no choice

53
00:08:48,198 --> 00:08:50,118
but to take that path.

54
00:09:07,888 --> 00:09:09,428
Tell me, Haksoo.

55
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:11,138
There were qualities

56
00:09:12,348 --> 00:09:13,978
that I longed to see

57
00:09:15,058 --> 00:09:18,818
in the tyrant, the late king,
and His Majesty.

58
00:09:19,978 --> 00:09:21,608
Why is it that

59
00:09:23,398 --> 00:09:24,778
I see them

60
00:09:25,948 --> 00:09:28,118
in your daughter now?

61
00:11:00,328 --> 00:11:02,038
You and Lady Park

62
00:11:02,668 --> 00:11:04,378
devised a secret plan behind my back.

63
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,088
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

64
00:11:07,088 --> 00:11:07,918
Kyun.

65
00:11:09,758 --> 00:11:11,968
I have chosen Lady Park as my companion.

66
00:11:13,178 --> 00:11:16,928
It will be a difficult journey,
Your Majesty.

67
00:11:17,768 --> 00:11:18,938
She will be…

68
00:11:21,228 --> 00:11:22,688
my wife.

69
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:26,978
Relay this to Siwol.

70
00:11:27,528 --> 00:11:31,318
He must pass
the upcoming special examination.

71
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:35,238
Yes, Your Majesty.
I will see to it that he does.

72
00:11:45,918 --> 00:11:47,798
His Majesty is delayed.

73
00:11:48,588 --> 00:11:49,668
I see.

74
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,718
I hear that the drought is severe.

75
00:11:55,258 --> 00:11:57,428
We will have a bad harvest this year.

76
00:12:19,118 --> 00:12:20,578
What are you looking at so intently?

77
00:12:23,498 --> 00:12:24,668
I… I stepped on it!

78
00:12:29,338 --> 00:12:31,508
Fortunately, it did not break.

79
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,718
Is that the fan I gave you?

80
00:12:39,638 --> 00:12:40,768
I brought it

81
00:12:42,018 --> 00:12:43,768
to give you an answer.

82
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:46,558
An answer?

83
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,608
THE LOVE CHILD BETWEEN BAMBOO AND PAPER

84
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:52,278
The day

85
00:12:53,568 --> 00:12:55,658
you gave me this fan,

86
00:12:57,408 --> 00:12:59,238
you said this to me.

87
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:08,088
"The love child between bamboo and paper.

88
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:14,588
It is the clear wind."

89
00:13:17,928 --> 00:13:20,848
It is one of the old poems
that stood out to me.

90
00:13:22,058 --> 00:13:23,228
Will you…

91
00:13:25,018 --> 00:13:26,648
accept this?

92
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:31,568
Can I give you an answer now?

93
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:37,238
I love you.

94
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:40,278
I loved you long before you loved me.

95
00:13:40,368 --> 00:13:42,998
I loved you more dearly than you loved me.

96
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:46,118
Our journey will be difficult,

97
00:13:46,788 --> 00:13:49,128
but not as difficult as losing you.

98
00:13:50,588 --> 00:13:52,668
Will you be my wife?

99
00:13:57,548 --> 00:13:58,718
Please…

100
00:14:01,848 --> 00:14:03,638
be my queen.

101
00:14:10,358 --> 00:14:12,358
You have so much to lose, Your Majesty.

102
00:14:19,778 --> 00:14:21,028
But you will be…

103
00:14:23,948 --> 00:14:25,408
with me.

104
00:14:44,808 --> 00:14:46,768
YEONGHWADANG

105
00:14:49,398 --> 00:14:50,438
Please go on in.

106
00:14:53,148 --> 00:14:55,898
His Majesty named this chamber
Yeonghwadang himself.

107
00:14:57,068 --> 00:14:59,698
"The gentleness within brings prosperity."

108
00:15:02,028 --> 00:15:04,618
I believed that he was teaching me
the virtues of a queen.

109
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:07,158
I was wrong.

110
00:15:08,498 --> 00:15:09,748
They were the virtues

111
00:15:11,128 --> 00:15:12,538
of a concubine.

112
00:15:29,558 --> 00:15:31,898
These ornaments are
gifts from His Majesty.

113
00:15:32,478 --> 00:15:33,478
How lovely they are.

114
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:40,398
Who cares?

115
00:15:40,488 --> 00:15:42,108
They mean nothing!

116
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:43,778
Please calm down, my lady.

117
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:45,158
Stop.

118
00:15:50,498 --> 00:15:53,458
Any gifts from His Majesty
should be treated as His Majesty himself.

119
00:15:54,378 --> 00:15:57,248
If His Majesty finds out,
you may get in serious trouble.

120
00:15:57,338 --> 00:15:58,758
If I become demoted,

121
00:15:59,588 --> 00:16:01,548
I know you will be
more delighted than anyone.

122
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:03,928
Do as you wish.

123
00:16:04,008 --> 00:16:07,258
I would rather get expelled
than put up with this humiliation.

124
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:24,408
The silk wrapped around wedding boxes

125
00:16:24,908 --> 00:16:26,618
does not merely serve aesthetic ends.

126
00:16:30,118 --> 00:16:32,078
It conveys the bride's parents' wish

127
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,998
that their daughter would be treated
with respect.

128
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:42,548
Think about those who care for you.

129
00:17:07,988 --> 00:17:10,368
You have delicate hands
for someone of low birth

130
00:17:10,448 --> 00:17:11,618
and are quite crafty.

131
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,118
Thank you, my lady.

132
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,208
Would you perhaps

133
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:17,458
like a viewing of the wedding boxes?

134
00:17:18,418 --> 00:17:19,958
-Wedding boxes?
-Yes.

135
00:17:20,048 --> 00:17:23,418
Silk is wrapped around the corners
making them presentable and eye-catching.

136
00:17:27,848 --> 00:17:29,138
Where is Ttonggeum now?

137
00:17:29,218 --> 00:17:30,468
Bring her to me right now.

138
00:17:33,098 --> 00:17:34,138
Ttonggeum.

139
00:17:34,348 --> 00:17:37,148
Do you remember the bamboo box sellers
that once visited my house?

140
00:17:41,898 --> 00:17:44,398
-Of course, my lady.
-One of them was a woman.

141
00:17:44,488 --> 00:17:47,618
Did you see her face?

142
00:17:48,658 --> 00:17:50,618
I sure did.

143
00:17:51,368 --> 00:17:53,448
Did she perhaps

144
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:58,038
bear any resemblance to Lady Park?

145
00:18:04,878 --> 00:18:06,928
That is impossible, my lady.

146
00:18:07,008 --> 00:18:10,008
How could a lowly merchant woman
look anything like Lady Park?

147
00:18:10,098 --> 00:18:12,008
They have no resemblance at all.

148
00:18:14,018 --> 00:18:15,018
Is that right?

149
00:18:17,518 --> 00:18:18,648
I guess you are right.

150
00:18:18,728 --> 00:18:20,978
In fact, she was
one abhorrent-looking woman.

151
00:18:21,068 --> 00:18:24,238
There were pockmarks all over her face,

152
00:18:24,818 --> 00:18:27,988
not to mention
her swollen, absolutely unsightly hands.

153
00:18:28,528 --> 00:18:30,818
I get goosebumps
just by thinking about them now.

154
00:18:32,618 --> 00:18:36,158
If you will excuse me, I will go and
check on the eunuchs at the King's Palace.

155
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:48,678
Court Lady Kim.

156
00:18:49,758 --> 00:18:51,508
I need you to visit
my private home right now.

157
00:19:39,848 --> 00:19:44,188
Look here.
I want to be of assistance to you.

158
00:19:45,148 --> 00:19:48,528
I hear you want
one of your relatives named Siwol

159
00:19:48,608 --> 00:19:50,948
to take the special examination.

160
00:19:51,028 --> 00:19:53,368
I'm thinking of doing you a big favor--

161
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:58,078
Eavesdropped again?

162
00:19:58,158 --> 00:20:00,578
If you eavesdrop on His Majesty
and me once more…

163
00:20:01,748 --> 00:20:03,418
then I will cut off your ear.

164
00:20:06,088 --> 00:20:08,798
"Consummation on the 7th in 3 months
shall lead to conception."

165
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,298
Not yesterday then.

166
00:20:23,558 --> 00:20:26,318
<i>Are you suggesting
that I desire something else?</i>

167
00:20:26,898 --> 00:20:30,278
I have yet to foresee
what it is you desire.

168
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:33,408
However, a son conceived on this date

169
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:36,908
will possess the utmost power
and authority in Joseon.

170
00:20:40,618 --> 00:20:42,618
Is that what you truly desire?

171
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,998
You vulgar and ignorant monk.

172
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:50,878
Do you truly believe

173
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,878
one can gain power
just by conceiving a son?

174
00:20:53,968 --> 00:20:55,218
The woman's family

175
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:58,388
shall serve as her sword.

176
00:20:59,098 --> 00:21:01,518
As she wishes to put her family
on the throne,

177
00:21:01,598 --> 00:21:02,518
her sword

178
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:06,108
shall be pointed at you in no time.

179
00:21:07,188 --> 00:21:09,398
By my daughter-in-law's sword,

180
00:21:11,568 --> 00:21:13,278
do you mean Councilor Park?

181
00:21:15,568 --> 00:21:16,658
Yes, Your Highness.

182
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:23,708
Then answer me this.

183
00:21:24,828 --> 00:21:25,828
What do you think

184
00:21:27,418 --> 00:21:28,418
will happen…

185
00:21:30,548 --> 00:21:31,708
to you tomorrow?

186
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:36,798
You shall pay for trying to come
between me and my people.

187
00:21:37,298 --> 00:21:40,308
Try and survive without a single ray
of light or a single drop of water.

188
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:42,808
If you are Maitreya, you will live.

189
00:21:43,728 --> 00:21:45,478
But if you are a mere human being,

190
00:21:48,438 --> 00:21:49,608
you will die.

191
00:21:50,358 --> 00:21:52,818
ON THE SEVENTH DAY IN THREE MONTHS

192
00:22:29,898 --> 00:22:31,228
I have a favor to ask.

193
00:22:32,568 --> 00:22:35,238
Please visit Master Lim
held at the Police Bureau.

194
00:22:35,818 --> 00:22:38,948
Truth be told,
His Majesty gave me the same order.

195
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:44,698
What are you planning to do?

196
00:22:47,748 --> 00:22:49,458
It depends on how Councilor Park reacts.

197
00:22:50,288 --> 00:22:51,708
Will he try to take advantage

198
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:55,628
of our superficial relationship now that
I spent a night with His Majesty? Or…

199
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:59,968
will he treat me as his enemy
who bears a grudge against him?

200
00:23:01,258 --> 00:23:03,598
I do not know what is on his mind yet.

201
00:23:22,658 --> 00:23:25,408
I remember who you are now.

202
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:30,078
When your friend ascended the throne,

203
00:23:30,538 --> 00:23:33,668
you retired to the countryside
to bury yourself in books.

204
00:23:34,668 --> 00:23:37,798
After even giving up on your career
and running away,

205
00:23:37,878 --> 00:23:41,298
what made you want
to take in Yoo Haksoo's daughter?

206
00:23:43,178 --> 00:23:44,718
What was your goal?

207
00:23:45,388 --> 00:23:47,558
There was no such thing.

208
00:23:47,638 --> 00:23:50,438
I know what you have been up to.

209
00:23:50,518 --> 00:23:54,308
Why did you help Bamboo Grove Village
out of poverty

210
00:23:54,728 --> 00:23:57,358
using Yoo Haksoo's daughter?

211
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:02,448
What were you trying to achieve
by winning the people's support?

212
00:24:03,028 --> 00:24:04,278
It was not my idea

213
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:07,368
but Jeong's own.

214
00:24:08,538 --> 00:24:11,498
She wanted to make sure
that no one around her

215
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:15,628
would die from poverty or disease.

216
00:24:19,048 --> 00:24:21,128
That was the only thing she ever wanted.

217
00:24:21,218 --> 00:24:22,758
She is the daughter of a traitor!

218
00:24:23,968 --> 00:24:27,808
And you are telling me that
all you wanted was to help the people?

219
00:24:33,398 --> 00:24:36,058
She lost her family because of you.

220
00:24:39,438 --> 00:24:40,898
She did not want anyone else

221
00:24:42,698 --> 00:24:45,068
to go through what she had to.

222
00:24:46,198 --> 00:24:50,948
No. She was only using you
to get her revenge.

223
00:24:53,168 --> 00:24:54,538
Do you not see it?

224
00:24:55,578 --> 00:25:00,208
She is even risking
her master's life to kill me.

225
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:03,378
It was you who took control of,
bargained away, and threatened

226
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:06,968
the lives of me, the crafters,
and everyone in Bamboo Grove Village.

227
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:10,018
Had Jeong not told me
this was to save everyone,

228
00:25:10,598 --> 00:25:13,348
I would not have let her
risk her life like this.

229
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:20,898
Is that right?

230
00:25:23,738 --> 00:25:28,078
I must figure out what she truly thinks
to see if you are right.

231
00:25:28,158 --> 00:25:32,078
I shall find out
whether it was to get revenge

232
00:25:32,748 --> 00:25:35,328
or to save the people

233
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:37,828
that she risked her life to kill me.

234
00:25:38,998 --> 00:25:39,998
Only after that…

235
00:25:45,548 --> 00:25:46,888
will I make a decision.

236
00:25:51,888 --> 00:25:53,728
POLICE BUREAU

237
00:25:59,898 --> 00:26:01,568
Seeing that you are safe

238
00:26:01,648 --> 00:26:03,818
and that she is trying to get the man
out of prison,

239
00:26:04,358 --> 00:26:07,278
I assume that Lady Park
has decided to live.

240
00:26:08,948 --> 00:26:10,328
Jinsa Lim of Bamboo Grove Village

241
00:26:10,408 --> 00:26:13,118
used to be a merchant
who even had access to ladies' chambers.

242
00:26:13,698 --> 00:26:17,498
And he falsely accused me
of violating his female apprentice.

243
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:22,668
He shall be punished for calumny
as prescribed by law.

244
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:23,758
Also,

245
00:26:25,298 --> 00:26:27,298
I intend to inform this
to His Majesty myself.

246
00:26:28,008 --> 00:26:31,138
In fact, I have a message for you
from His Majesty.

247
00:26:32,178 --> 00:26:34,928
He wishes to question
the chief eunuch himself.

248
00:26:39,438 --> 00:26:42,398
This is unfair, Your Majesty.

249
00:26:42,478 --> 00:26:44,688
I sold government posts for money?

250
00:26:44,778 --> 00:26:47,648
That is utter nonsense!

251
00:26:47,738 --> 00:26:49,698
After all the kindness
that you have shown to me,

252
00:26:49,778 --> 00:26:54,408
how could I ever pursue
my selfish interests?

253
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:56,408
I hear that you influenced

254
00:26:56,498 --> 00:27:00,288
not only the eunuch department
but also the court lady positions.

255
00:27:00,378 --> 00:27:03,628
That is not true, Your Majesty!

256
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:06,968
Let me tell you how to save yourself.

257
00:27:09,678 --> 00:27:12,638
Was it Councilor Park who ordered you
to lock up your superior?

258
00:27:14,888 --> 00:27:17,268
Your Majesty, that is…

259
00:27:17,348 --> 00:27:18,848
Was it?

260
00:27:19,768 --> 00:27:21,188
The investigation shall begin soon.

261
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:23,568
Your Majesty…

262
00:27:23,648 --> 00:27:24,858
It may

263
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:31,158
prove difficult to punish him
for the incident.

264
00:27:31,618 --> 00:27:34,528
Would you rather be framed
for taking bribes, then?

265
00:27:34,618 --> 00:27:37,748
I have never taken any bribes

266
00:27:37,828 --> 00:27:40,788
or sold any government posts.

267
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:41,708
However,

268
00:27:42,668 --> 00:27:45,798
I may know what this is about.

269
00:27:46,548 --> 00:27:49,338
Those who wish to establish connections
with the Queen Dowager

270
00:27:49,838 --> 00:27:53,088
sometimes used my name--

271
00:27:53,178 --> 00:27:55,598
The Left State Councilor enters.

272
00:28:16,158 --> 00:28:17,538
You may continue.

273
00:28:17,618 --> 00:28:18,908
I am intrigued.

274
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:20,578
Your Majesty.

275
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:24,708
Please trust my loyalty to you.

276
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:25,838
Your Majesty.

277
00:28:26,588 --> 00:28:30,298
Second Inspector Yoon
has been investigating Eunuch Heo.

278
00:28:30,378 --> 00:28:33,128
By questioning him,
you will be able to find out

279
00:28:33,218 --> 00:28:36,808
all about Eunuch Heo's faults.

280
00:28:36,888 --> 00:28:39,808
-Councilor Park!
-Your plan was to abandon him all along.

281
00:28:39,888 --> 00:28:42,478
You are the one
who decides a eunuch's use.

282
00:28:43,058 --> 00:28:45,478
I merely follow your decisions.

283
00:28:46,568 --> 00:28:47,818
Your Majesty!

284
00:28:48,318 --> 00:28:51,188
Your Majesty!

285
00:28:51,778 --> 00:28:54,028
I am your loyal servant! Your Majesty!

286
00:28:54,108 --> 00:28:56,158
I would never betray you!

287
00:28:56,238 --> 00:28:58,988
Your Majesty!

288
00:29:08,128 --> 00:29:10,458
Is Eunuch Heo not useful to you anymore?

289
00:29:11,588 --> 00:29:14,718
How can he be of any use
when you no longer trust him?

290
00:29:15,008 --> 00:29:18,718
I merely read your mind
and take action accordingly.

291
00:29:18,808 --> 00:29:20,468
Who do you think

292
00:29:21,808 --> 00:29:23,478
I am leaning toward now?

293
00:29:28,148 --> 00:29:29,228
Do you wish

294
00:29:30,778 --> 00:29:32,568
to save Lady Park?

295
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:34,778
What if I do?

296
00:29:37,488 --> 00:29:38,578
I will never

297
00:29:40,038 --> 00:29:43,498
let her attempt to go down with you.

298
00:29:43,578 --> 00:29:44,708
Then,

299
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:48,338
I will follow your wish

300
00:29:49,628 --> 00:29:51,338
and surrender.

301
00:29:53,378 --> 00:29:56,218
Your Majesty, Lady Park enters.

302
00:30:20,078 --> 00:30:21,908
By the way,

303
00:30:21,988 --> 00:30:25,708
are you ready to fully accept
Yoo Haksoo's daughter?

304
00:30:28,248 --> 00:30:30,088
Think about what he did.

305
00:30:30,168 --> 00:30:32,998
He is a traitor who brutally assassinated

306
00:30:33,628 --> 00:30:34,878
your mother.

307
00:30:34,968 --> 00:30:37,548
He is not a traitor.

308
00:30:40,678 --> 00:30:42,928
If that is what you believe,

309
00:30:43,428 --> 00:30:47,938
I may be able to grant Lady Park's wish.

310
00:30:58,238 --> 00:31:00,068
<i>Jinsa Lim shall be released</i>

311
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:03,198
<i>as well as the crafters
in Bamboo Grove Village.</i>

312
00:31:06,618 --> 00:31:08,788
Yoo Haksoo's name will be cleared,

313
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:11,288
and he will be reinstated.

314
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:15,878
However,

315
00:31:16,588 --> 00:31:18,928
there is a problem to solve before that.

316
00:31:21,468 --> 00:31:23,388
-Move out of the way!
-Move!

317
00:31:23,468 --> 00:31:24,928
-My goodness.
-What is going on?

318
00:31:25,018 --> 00:31:27,728
<i>A poster has been put up in Banchon.</i>

319
00:31:30,058 --> 00:31:33,308
It claims that the late Queen Inyoung

320
00:31:35,028 --> 00:31:39,738
was not assassinated by Yoo Haksoo
but Left State Councilor Park Gyewon.

321
00:31:45,488 --> 00:31:46,448
Your Majesty.

322
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:48,748
The Chief Royal Secretary
wishes to speak to you urgently.

323
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:52,498
"The people believe
the real culprit is someone else,

324
00:31:52,958 --> 00:31:54,378
but no one dares speak up.

325
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:57,088
The reason is that the real culprit is
the Left State Councilor."

326
00:31:59,088 --> 00:32:00,928
That is what the poster says.

327
00:32:01,548 --> 00:32:03,548
Those insolent lunatics!

328
00:32:07,308 --> 00:32:08,348
Your Majesty.

329
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:11,138
The entire nation believes
that I am the real culprit.

330
00:32:11,728 --> 00:32:14,768
I feel so frustrated
that I cannot sleep at night.

331
00:32:16,438 --> 00:32:17,978
I beg you.

332
00:32:18,648 --> 00:32:22,408
Please find the real culprit
who assassinated the late Queen

333
00:32:23,238 --> 00:32:24,528
and clear the names

334
00:32:26,408 --> 00:32:28,908
of me and Yoo Haksoo,

335
00:32:31,538 --> 00:32:33,248
who was unfairly executed.

336
00:33:06,408 --> 00:33:07,368
Councilor Park.

337
00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:13,868
What are you planning?

338
00:33:14,458 --> 00:33:18,208
What are you trying to achieve
by revealing what you have done?

339
00:33:19,668 --> 00:33:22,508
I intend to let people know
that I have done nothing.

340
00:33:24,218 --> 00:33:26,008
You started all this.

341
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:30,428
You deserve to know
who the real culprit is.

342
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:34,638
You and the officials assassinated
the late Queen.

343
00:33:35,228 --> 00:33:38,478
My father was executed
after being framed for the assassination.

344
00:33:39,228 --> 00:33:40,438
You are

345
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:42,648
my enemy.

346
00:33:45,658 --> 00:33:47,818
Had the late Queen been deposed,

347
00:33:48,908 --> 00:33:50,908
it was the Crown Prince's turn next.

348
00:33:51,578 --> 00:33:55,498
Do you believe that the Queen's deposition
was the officials' final goal?

349
00:33:55,578 --> 00:33:56,458
Also,

350
00:33:56,538 --> 00:33:59,168
do you think
that the late Queen was not aware?

351
00:34:00,548 --> 00:34:01,548
That her death

352
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:06,258
would be the only remaining shield
to protect the Crown Prince.

353
00:34:16,898 --> 00:34:19,148
Now who do you think

354
00:34:20,938 --> 00:34:22,438
your real enemy is?

355
00:34:41,668 --> 00:34:42,748
<i>Your mother</i>

356
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:45,588
<i>will not become a deposed queen.</i>

357
00:34:46,968 --> 00:34:49,588
<i>I will die as the Queen of this country.</i>

358
00:34:50,468 --> 00:34:55,308
<i>I have been poisoned to death
with you, Crown Prince.</i>

359
00:34:55,978 --> 00:34:58,598
<i>Remember that for life…</i>

360
00:34:59,768 --> 00:35:01,018
<i>and make use of it.</i>

361
00:35:01,898 --> 00:35:03,898
<i>The only thing that'll keep you safe</i>

362
00:35:05,278 --> 00:35:07,568
<i>is the sympathy people will have for you</i>

363
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:10,318
<i>as a child of a poisoned mother.</i>

364
00:35:43,268 --> 00:35:45,278
<i>What kind of choice will she make?</i>

365
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:48,898
<i>What kind of path will she take
after making that choice?</i>

366
00:35:49,318 --> 00:35:51,278
<i>What are her goals?</i>

367
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:54,738
<i>What is most important to her?</i>

368
00:35:55,488 --> 00:35:58,248
<i>I must find out.</i>

369
00:36:23,018 --> 00:36:24,688
How long have you been waiting?

370
00:36:27,278 --> 00:36:29,148
Why did no one inform me
that you were here?

371
00:36:29,238 --> 00:36:32,318
I asked them not to.

372
00:36:48,628 --> 00:36:50,548
What if you had to wait longer?

373
00:37:09,568 --> 00:37:15,198
When I was wandering around searching for
my parents' corpses outside Kwangheemun,

374
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:18,028
I always carried a dagger under my jacket,

375
00:37:19,078 --> 00:37:21,118
ready to kill anyone.

376
00:37:23,618 --> 00:37:25,998
I could not even make
proper graves for them.

377
00:37:28,798 --> 00:37:30,418
If I had,

378
00:37:32,588 --> 00:37:35,638
people would have spat on them,
believing they were criminals' graves.

379
00:37:37,098 --> 00:37:40,968
I wanted the world to know
that my father was innocent…

380
00:37:43,938 --> 00:37:46,438
and was merely framed.

381
00:37:51,818 --> 00:37:53,648
By clearing my father's name,

382
00:37:55,658 --> 00:37:57,988
you would earn the admiration
of the Sarim.

383
00:38:01,948 --> 00:38:03,038
So what is it…

384
00:38:05,618 --> 00:38:07,248
that prevents you…

385
00:38:11,048 --> 00:38:12,338
from doing so?

386
00:38:19,848 --> 00:38:21,258
There is something about that…

387
00:38:24,138 --> 00:38:25,808
I must tell you.

388
00:38:32,568 --> 00:38:33,778
Lady Park.

389
00:38:34,778 --> 00:38:35,778
Please do not say it.

390
00:38:38,738 --> 00:38:39,698
I must.

391
00:38:44,618 --> 00:38:45,908
My mother…

392
00:38:48,078 --> 00:38:49,208
swallowed poison…

393
00:38:52,668 --> 00:38:54,418
to protect me.

394
00:38:56,338 --> 00:38:59,798
My father sacrificed

395
00:39:01,468 --> 00:39:02,968
your family…

396
00:39:07,348 --> 00:39:09,058
to protect me.

397
00:39:12,648 --> 00:39:13,648
I had…

398
00:39:15,898 --> 00:39:17,608
desired you.

399
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,108
I had wanted you to be my wife.

400
00:39:21,118 --> 00:39:22,738
My greed is…

401
00:39:26,788 --> 00:39:28,708
what destroyed…

402
00:39:32,708 --> 00:39:34,248
you and your family.

403
00:39:44,808 --> 00:39:46,308
Please excuse me.

404
00:40:13,998 --> 00:40:15,128
Ttonggeum!

405
00:40:15,418 --> 00:40:17,208
-Yes?
-Ttonggeum!

406
00:40:17,298 --> 00:40:20,298
I gave you those dried persimmons
as promised. Now tell me.

407
00:40:20,928 --> 00:40:21,968
I know nothing.

408
00:40:22,048 --> 00:40:25,258
How should I know where Miss is?

409
00:40:25,888 --> 00:40:29,388
You didn't tell me
where Lord Lim was, either.

410
00:40:29,478 --> 00:40:31,888
Don't expect me to tell you anything
even if I knew.

411
00:40:31,978 --> 00:40:33,648
I have no idea.

412
00:40:33,728 --> 00:40:35,018
All right. Fine.

413
00:40:35,108 --> 00:40:37,688
Slow down. You'll choke on it.

414
00:40:38,438 --> 00:40:41,988
Did you not even take a peek
while delivering the letter?

415
00:40:42,568 --> 00:40:45,488
Oh, right. You don't know how to read.

416
00:40:46,618 --> 00:40:49,448
-I can read a few characters!
-Like what?

417
00:40:50,078 --> 00:40:53,458
The first two characters?
I know that much, too.

418
00:40:53,538 --> 00:40:56,038
My goodness. All right, then.

419
00:40:56,878 --> 00:40:59,338
I'll stop asking.

420
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:01,378
Just take this.

421
00:41:02,508 --> 00:41:03,588
Oh, dear.

422
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:10,518
I was going to give it to you
when you get married.

423
00:41:11,348 --> 00:41:13,268
Who would've known you'd enter the palace?

424
00:41:17,188 --> 00:41:18,268
Take it.

425
00:41:19,478 --> 00:41:22,948
It's expensive and not something to eat.
Why did you…

426
00:41:26,698 --> 00:41:28,368
If this is the life you want,

427
00:41:29,698 --> 00:41:30,748
I wish you good luck.

428
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:34,418
I must say, I feel relieved to know

429
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:36,708
that you won't starve anymore.

430
00:41:42,258 --> 00:41:43,298
Oh, well…

431
00:42:17,378 --> 00:42:19,788
Nanny, did you see her?

432
00:42:19,878 --> 00:42:21,168
Yes, my lady.

433
00:42:22,168 --> 00:42:24,418
She is the woman who came by to sell

434
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:26,678
bamboo boxes indeed.

435
00:42:29,968 --> 00:42:31,928
Bring Ttonggeum to me now!

436
00:42:44,488 --> 00:42:47,238
I told you to bring Ttonggeum to me.
Where have you been?

437
00:43:12,808 --> 00:43:14,808
Did you send for me, my lady?

438
00:43:25,938 --> 00:43:27,068
Nanny said that

439
00:43:28,568 --> 00:43:30,698
she wanted to see you.

440
00:43:33,448 --> 00:43:34,618
You may leave now.

441
00:43:35,238 --> 00:43:36,118
I see.

442
00:43:36,998 --> 00:43:39,748
I will say hello to her later.

443
00:43:51,798 --> 00:43:53,798
She was born and raised in my house.

444
00:43:53,888 --> 00:43:56,718
She is no more than an animal I keep,
and she deceived me.

445
00:43:56,808 --> 00:44:00,098
She challenged my authority!
How could you tell me to hold back?

446
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:02,148
I would even kill her to make her confess.

447
00:44:02,228 --> 00:44:04,148
The person trying to hide Lady Park's past

448
00:44:05,228 --> 00:44:06,188
is His Majesty.

449
00:44:10,488 --> 00:44:12,778
Are you certain that
Lady Park was the bamboo box seller?

450
00:44:12,868 --> 00:44:16,078
Would you say that even after
being tortured at the State Tribunal?

451
00:44:16,698 --> 00:44:18,328
I only saw her…

452
00:44:19,288 --> 00:44:21,918
a couple of times,
so I cannot say I am certain.

453
00:44:21,998 --> 00:44:23,168
Nanny!

454
00:44:29,258 --> 00:44:32,008
This accusation would risk
the extermination of our entire family.

455
00:44:32,588 --> 00:44:33,928
To keep Lady Park safe,

456
00:44:34,008 --> 00:44:36,348
His Majesty and the Left State Councilor
may join hands.

457
00:44:37,638 --> 00:44:40,598
I will look into it.
Please do not cause any more trouble.

458
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,728
She is fake, Father!

459
00:44:44,308 --> 00:44:46,018
The woman who took my place

460
00:44:46,108 --> 00:44:48,818
is faking her identity!

461
00:44:57,738 --> 00:44:58,868
Father!

462
00:45:12,588 --> 00:45:13,928
Are you looking into those people?

463
00:45:14,008 --> 00:45:17,348
Yes. They are bamboo box sellers
from Bamboo Grove Village.

464
00:45:17,428 --> 00:45:21,428
I have people searching for them,
but they have vanished into thin air.

465
00:45:23,978 --> 00:45:25,098
Bamboo Grove Village?

466
00:45:29,528 --> 00:45:31,648
Why do you not visit me more often?

467
00:45:31,738 --> 00:45:33,818
It is always so good to see you,

468
00:45:34,408 --> 00:45:36,068
but you never visit me
unless I ask you to.

469
00:45:36,658 --> 00:45:38,278
Forgive us, Your Highness.

470
00:45:39,288 --> 00:45:40,868
I have been busy with official duties.

471
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:43,908
Also, the case I am investigating
at the moment

472
00:45:44,288 --> 00:45:46,128
happens to involve those who work for you.

473
00:45:46,578 --> 00:45:47,668
Inspector Park.

474
00:45:48,588 --> 00:45:49,498
It is fine.

475
00:45:50,418 --> 00:45:52,458
I know how he is.

476
00:45:52,968 --> 00:45:54,838
I did hear that

477
00:45:54,928 --> 00:45:57,388
some of my servants
have been involved with Eunuch Heo.

478
00:45:58,298 --> 00:45:59,888
Do visit once the investigation is over.

479
00:46:02,018 --> 00:46:03,768
Thank you for your understanding.

480
00:46:04,638 --> 00:46:06,228
Those who I long for are busy,

481
00:46:07,148 --> 00:46:09,058
and I am surrounded by sly people.

482
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:12,278
I have few people that I can trust.

483
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:14,528
You have the entire government
serving you.

484
00:46:15,278 --> 00:46:16,948
Please do not say that.

485
00:46:17,028 --> 00:46:20,118
It is the Left State Councilor, not me,
that the government serves.

486
00:46:20,198 --> 00:46:21,198
Then again,

487
00:46:23,118 --> 00:46:26,368
power can even make
one's romantic rival bow to another.

488
00:46:53,028 --> 00:46:54,028
Your Highness.

489
00:46:54,108 --> 00:46:56,738
The Chief Army Commander
of Hamgyong Province

490
00:46:56,818 --> 00:46:58,658
will arrive here in a few days.

491
00:46:59,698 --> 00:47:00,698
My uncle?

492
00:47:01,578 --> 00:47:02,578
Why, all of a sudden?

493
00:47:02,658 --> 00:47:06,868
His Majesty wishes to assign him
a government post.

494
00:47:09,038 --> 00:47:09,958
Your Highness.

495
00:47:10,038 --> 00:47:12,878
It is exactly as that monk said.

496
00:47:24,218 --> 00:47:25,468
Be quiet.

497
00:47:26,058 --> 00:47:27,348
That wicked monk has no idea.

498
00:47:31,108 --> 00:47:32,358
Welcome, Councilor Park.

499
00:47:51,038 --> 00:47:54,998
You seem to be spending more time
in the back garden recently.

500
00:47:56,668 --> 00:47:57,668
Your Highness.

501
00:47:58,418 --> 00:48:00,548
You must feel confined in your chamber.

502
00:48:01,968 --> 00:48:03,718
Most certainly.

503
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,308
I spent half my life
confined to the lady's chamber

504
00:48:06,388 --> 00:48:07,468
and the other half…

505
00:48:09,808 --> 00:48:11,898
to this palace.

506
00:48:12,858 --> 00:48:13,978
I put

507
00:48:14,518 --> 00:48:17,318
such a heavy burden on you.

508
00:48:19,238 --> 00:48:23,658
Politics can be dangerous and dirty.

509
00:48:24,698 --> 00:48:27,158
You deserve to live like a flower,

510
00:48:29,408 --> 00:48:31,538
and I dragged you
into this dangerous place.

511
00:48:34,038 --> 00:48:34,998
Your Highness.

512
00:48:35,588 --> 00:48:37,588
But someday…

513
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:41,218
you may be able to spend your time
more enjoyably.

514
00:48:42,548 --> 00:48:43,588
You speak as though

515
00:48:44,678 --> 00:48:47,138
there is someone who can replace me.

516
00:48:48,468 --> 00:48:51,768
I am planning to test Lady Park.

517
00:48:54,438 --> 00:48:56,768
I am going to watch her and find out

518
00:48:57,148 --> 00:49:00,488
whether she is capable
of taking charge of the palace.

519
00:49:06,778 --> 00:49:10,078
He will isolate you
in order to save his family member.

520
00:49:10,158 --> 00:49:11,708
He is your real enemy.

521
00:49:11,908 --> 00:49:14,628
One of your family members
will arrive at the palace soon.

522
00:49:14,708 --> 00:49:16,538
You will have no choice
but to believe me then.

523
00:49:44,448 --> 00:49:46,528
Is there a book you are looking for?

524
00:49:48,868 --> 00:49:51,498
I was hoping to read
about the late Queen Inyoung.

525
00:49:53,618 --> 00:49:55,538
There are no official documents left,

526
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:58,418
but give me a moment.

527
00:50:11,268 --> 00:50:14,058
The late Queen wrote these letters
to her court ladies.

528
00:50:15,228 --> 00:50:18,358
They were discarded
when the court ladies were executed,

529
00:50:18,438 --> 00:50:20,188
but I kept them in the library

530
00:50:20,268 --> 00:50:21,978
as they were
in the late Queen's handwriting.

531
00:50:28,948 --> 00:50:30,578
What was she like?

532
00:50:30,658 --> 00:50:32,738
I never served her directly,

533
00:50:33,328 --> 00:50:36,668
but I do know that she lived
in her private house until the coup

534
00:50:37,288 --> 00:50:40,378
and that she was particularly close
with her son.

535
00:50:40,458 --> 00:50:43,418
I AM SORRY TO HEAR THAT
HIS MAJESTY HAS A POOR APPETITE

536
00:50:43,508 --> 00:50:46,178
A FEW YEARS AGO, MY ACORN JELLY
HELPED HIM REGAIN HIS APPETITE

537
00:52:12,008 --> 00:52:13,218
What do you suggest

538
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:16,348
that I should do?

539
00:52:18,518 --> 00:52:20,018
What am I supposed to do?

540
00:52:21,518 --> 00:52:24,188
I read some letters
that the late Queen wrote.

541
00:52:24,898 --> 00:52:27,778
In her every letter to the court ladies,

542
00:52:29,898 --> 00:52:31,068
she expressed…

543
00:52:33,158 --> 00:52:35,738
her concern for her husband and son.

544
00:52:38,578 --> 00:52:41,538
I do understand why she had to make

545
00:52:43,168 --> 00:52:44,328
such a tragic choice.

546
00:52:46,588 --> 00:52:48,628
I myself once attempted
to make the same choice.

547
00:52:52,178 --> 00:52:53,138
However,

548
00:52:54,638 --> 00:52:56,808
she was cruel to my father.

549
00:52:59,218 --> 00:53:01,098
On the night before the third screening,

550
00:53:01,728 --> 00:53:04,228
my father cried all night
outside my chamber.

551
00:53:05,358 --> 00:53:07,818
Saying it was a decision
made as an official, not as a father,

552
00:53:09,228 --> 00:53:10,358
he apologized to me.

553
00:53:12,028 --> 00:53:14,108
As though he was putting
his own child through danger,

554
00:53:15,698 --> 00:53:16,828
he cried

555
00:53:17,988 --> 00:53:19,328
and cried again.

556
00:53:23,538 --> 00:53:25,628
You ask what you should do?

557
00:53:26,588 --> 00:53:27,958
If you intended to do something,

558
00:53:29,958 --> 00:53:31,088
you would already have.

559
00:53:33,298 --> 00:53:34,508
You were…

560
00:53:37,048 --> 00:53:39,308
planning to keep it buried
for the rest of your life.

561
00:53:41,848 --> 00:53:43,138
What you said…

562
00:53:46,098 --> 00:53:47,188
is right.

563
00:53:49,188 --> 00:53:50,568
I still cannot promise

564
00:53:51,738 --> 00:53:53,778
that I will be able to clear

565
00:53:55,528 --> 00:53:56,868
Yoo Haksoo's name.

566
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:22,598
<i>If there were rice paddies in the palace,</i>

567
00:54:22,678 --> 00:54:24,808
it would help understand
the crop situation

568
00:54:24,888 --> 00:54:26,938
and provide appropriate support
to the people.

569
00:54:27,768 --> 00:54:30,268
I hope that will come true someday.

570
00:54:30,358 --> 00:54:34,358
The royal office is the first to know
the crop situation anyway.

571
00:54:35,488 --> 00:54:36,738
Once there is a drought,

572
00:54:36,818 --> 00:54:40,948
requests for a rainmaking ritual
begin to pour in immediately.

573
00:54:43,038 --> 00:54:46,118
One cannot make it rain
by making rice paddies in the palace

574
00:54:46,958 --> 00:54:48,878
and conducting rainmaking rituals.

575
00:54:50,458 --> 00:54:52,338
It would be a much better idea
to build levees.

576
00:54:52,918 --> 00:54:55,128
It is not that the people
do not understand that.

577
00:54:56,168 --> 00:54:57,178
It is just that

578
00:54:57,258 --> 00:55:01,178
they are so desperate
that they grasp at straws.

579
00:55:17,108 --> 00:55:21,198
His Majesty is cultivating soil
in the palace with farmers today.

580
00:55:22,908 --> 00:55:23,988
Is that right?

581
00:55:24,868 --> 00:55:26,868
I heard that it was your request.

582
00:55:29,458 --> 00:55:30,668
Did he send for me?

583
00:55:32,248 --> 00:55:33,418
No, he did not.

584
00:55:54,568 --> 00:55:56,738
His Majesty arrives!

585
00:56:10,078 --> 00:56:13,708
Are you adding a new layer of soil
to increase fertility?

586
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:15,298
Yes, Your Majesty.

587
00:56:17,338 --> 00:56:18,378
Go ahead and demonstrate.

588
00:56:18,468 --> 00:56:21,298
Yes, I will do it.

589
00:56:23,798 --> 00:56:25,098
Farmers outside the capital

590
00:56:26,178 --> 00:56:27,888
must be busy preparing their soil.

591
00:56:28,928 --> 00:56:32,148
The soil dried up during the winter.
We will have a bad harvest again.

592
00:56:33,938 --> 00:56:34,808
Is it that bad?

593
00:56:34,898 --> 00:56:38,108
Rainmaking rituals are
being conducted everywhere.

594
00:56:38,188 --> 00:56:39,608
I am sure it will rain soon.

595
00:56:40,988 --> 00:56:42,238
Rainmaking rituals?

596
00:56:43,158 --> 00:56:45,158
I reckon I should conduct
a rainmaking ritual

597
00:56:46,118 --> 00:56:47,408
myself as well.

598
00:56:47,488 --> 00:56:50,578
-Thank you, Your Majesty.
-That would be great, Your Majesty.

599
00:56:50,658 --> 00:56:53,748
-We appreciate it.
-Thank you, Your Majesty.

600
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:55,538
Goodness gracious.

601
00:56:55,628 --> 00:56:59,048
-We appreciate it.
-But that does not guarantee rain.

602
00:56:59,128 --> 00:57:00,878
Your Majesty, that is not true.

603
00:57:00,968 --> 00:57:03,508
If you pray earnestly,

604
00:57:04,088 --> 00:57:05,508
the sky will certainly respond.

605
00:57:05,598 --> 00:57:08,218
-Absolutely.
-Of course.

606
00:57:08,308 --> 00:57:11,348
You are different from us lowly commoners.

607
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,978
The skies will respond to your prayer
and give us rain.

608
00:57:27,278 --> 00:57:28,368
Raise your head.

609
00:57:28,448 --> 00:57:29,538
But…

610
00:57:33,788 --> 00:57:35,328
I allow you

611
00:57:36,538 --> 00:57:37,498
to raise your head.

612
00:57:54,558 --> 00:57:55,728
So this is how you look.

613
00:57:58,518 --> 00:58:00,028
Why did I not try to see…

614
00:58:02,858 --> 00:58:04,528
your faces sooner?

615
00:58:57,418 --> 00:59:01,168
<i>I will find out
whether it was to get revenge</i>

616
00:59:01,798 --> 00:59:04,668
<i>or to save the people</i>

617
00:59:05,298 --> 00:59:06,928
<i>that she risked her life to kill me.</i>

618
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:23,528
I heard that Lady Park summoned you
to the palace.

619
00:59:24,608 --> 00:59:25,988
What was it about?

620
00:59:26,738 --> 00:59:28,318
There is someone waiting for you.

621
00:59:29,988 --> 00:59:32,158
This place is too humble for her.

622
00:59:32,238 --> 00:59:34,868
You should go and see her.

623
01:00:57,908 --> 01:01:02,168
<i>I intend to find out
whether Lady Park has what it takes</i>

624
01:01:02,618 --> 01:01:04,128
<i>before I decide</i>

625
01:01:04,208 --> 01:01:07,298
<i>whether to abandon her or serve her.</i>

626
01:01:12,178 --> 01:01:14,388
Will he serve her as he serves me

627
01:01:15,428 --> 01:01:16,508
or…

628
01:01:20,978 --> 01:01:23,438
serve her instead of me?

629
01:01:31,438 --> 01:01:33,738
You asked who my real enemy was.

630
01:01:37,118 --> 01:01:39,118
Did you find the answer?

631
01:01:40,198 --> 01:01:41,158
I did.

632
01:01:42,248 --> 01:01:43,788
And I am here to give you the answer.

633
01:01:45,328 --> 01:01:48,498
Once I hear it,

634
01:01:48,708 --> 01:01:50,548
I would like to give you an answer
as well.

635
01:01:59,968 --> 01:02:02,178
The late Queen sacrificed her own life

636
01:02:02,978 --> 01:02:05,268
to protect the Crown Prince.

637
01:02:07,558 --> 01:02:09,978
The late King executed my father

638
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:14,398
for assassinating her to protect him.

639
01:02:17,658 --> 01:02:19,618
You exterminated

640
01:02:21,118 --> 01:02:22,408
my family

641
01:02:24,078 --> 01:02:25,708
to save the officials.

642
01:02:29,878 --> 01:02:31,588
In other words,
all of them are my enemies.

643
01:02:32,918 --> 01:02:34,838
You, the late King,

644
01:02:36,678 --> 01:02:37,798
and even His Majesty.

645
01:02:42,518 --> 01:02:45,728
<i>Then who do I get back at for this?</i>

646
01:02:46,728 --> 01:02:48,558
<i>The meritorious subjects</i>

647
01:02:48,648 --> 01:02:51,358
<i>who destroyed my family
to annihilate the Sarim?</i>

648
01:02:51,438 --> 01:02:54,108
<i>Or should it be His Majesty</i>

649
01:02:54,188 --> 01:02:57,158
<i>who framed my father
in order to protect the Crown Prince?</i>

650
01:02:58,618 --> 01:03:00,158
Who…

651
01:03:03,948 --> 01:03:06,118
should be the target of my revenge?

652
01:03:20,008 --> 01:03:20,848
Here is

653
01:03:21,678 --> 01:03:23,058
my answer.

654
01:04:09,348 --> 01:04:12,358
BLOODY HEART

655
01:04:32,828 --> 01:04:34,878
<i>Then, the Queen. I shall be.</i>

656
01:04:35,458 --> 01:04:37,378
<i>As your niece.</i>

657
01:04:37,458 --> 01:04:40,968
I will crown Lady Park as Queen.

658
01:04:41,048 --> 01:04:44,008
<i>I will serve her
just as I have served you.</i>

659
01:04:44,098 --> 01:04:45,758
<i>Once I have regained authority,</i>

660
01:04:45,848 --> 01:04:48,308
<i>I will be sure
to clear your father's name.</i>

661
01:04:48,388 --> 01:04:49,978
<i>I will wait.</i>

662
01:04:50,688 --> 01:04:52,978
<i>I am aware of one of her secrets.</i>

663
01:04:53,058 --> 01:04:54,148
What would that be?

664
01:04:54,228 --> 01:04:56,108
<i>Have you forgotten who she sides with?</i>

665
01:04:56,188 --> 01:04:59,358
<i>Having her in our corner
makes for the perfect opportunity.</i>

666
01:04:59,438 --> 01:05:00,648
<i>Are they on their way?</i>

667

<i>I must find Consort Park.</i>

<i>She must be found.</i>
