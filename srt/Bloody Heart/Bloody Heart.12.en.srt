BLOODY HEART

2
00:00:46,258 --> 00:00:49,178
THE PEOPLE, GROUPS, PLACES, AND INCIDENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE PURELY FICTIONAL

3
00:01:03,908 --> 00:01:05,158
His Majesty…

4
00:01:08,158 --> 00:01:09,698
has awakened.

5
00:01:12,408 --> 00:01:15,748
-What is going on?
-What is this?

6
00:01:18,498 --> 00:01:19,878
But I am afraid

7
00:01:21,258 --> 00:01:23,378
he will never open his eyes again.

8
00:01:29,008 --> 00:01:31,968
What have you done to His Majesty?

9
00:01:34,558 --> 00:01:37,058
No, what are you trying to do?

10
00:01:37,648 --> 00:01:38,648
Nothing.

11
00:01:39,148 --> 00:01:42,108
It's just that
the will of fate is upon me.

12
00:01:42,778 --> 00:01:46,108
Once His Majesty dies, everything I do
will be for the sake of this nation.

13
00:01:47,658 --> 00:01:49,078
That is treason.

14
00:01:49,778 --> 00:01:52,328
You men could not fathom
a woman could be treacherous.

15
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:56,668
The ones who gave all power
to the Queen Dowager and the Queen

16
00:01:56,748 --> 00:01:58,458
in case of the King's absence are…

17
00:02:00,628 --> 00:02:02,628
you men.

18
00:02:04,218 --> 00:02:05,378
I will

19
00:02:05,468 --> 00:02:08,798
take the power
which Joseon bequeathed to me.

20
00:02:15,518 --> 00:02:17,228
Your Highness.

21
00:02:18,348 --> 00:02:22,228
You will not get your hands
on any power so easily.

22
00:02:23,988 --> 00:02:25,358
I will…

23
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,198
stop you.

24
00:02:55,018 --> 00:02:56,268
Pull the blind up.

25
00:03:21,378 --> 00:03:23,878
Royal Physician,
share His Majesty's condition.

26
00:03:29,548 --> 00:03:31,928
The poison in his stomach
has been neutralized.

27
00:03:32,428 --> 00:03:33,348
However,

28
00:03:34,178 --> 00:03:35,968
his consciousness has not returned yet.

29
00:03:36,558 --> 00:03:37,598
So?

30
00:03:37,678 --> 00:03:39,558
He's young and healthy,

31
00:03:39,638 --> 00:03:42,148
so he may regain his consciousness today.

32
00:03:44,478 --> 00:03:47,568
Has it been a month or a year

33
00:03:47,988 --> 00:03:49,488
since His Majesty collapsed?

34
00:03:50,398 --> 00:03:51,778
It has only been two days.

35
00:03:52,368 --> 00:03:55,528
How dare you discuss
regency by the Queen Dowager before him?

36
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,498
If His Majesty becomes well today,

37
00:03:59,248 --> 00:04:01,458
how will you inform him
of this precipitous situation?

38
00:04:03,628 --> 00:04:05,538
The Queen Dowager gave us an order--

39
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:09,588
Since when did the Royal Court accept
someone's will without justification?

40
00:04:14,468 --> 00:04:16,388
I will trust that
you will not take any actions

41
00:04:17,468 --> 00:04:19,388
that will make you seem treacherous.

42
00:04:35,698 --> 00:04:38,198
BLOODY HEART
EPISODE 12

43
00:04:49,798 --> 00:04:51,838
Inspector Park is present.

44
00:05:05,558 --> 00:05:07,978
How can
such an extreme situation break out?

45
00:05:09,278 --> 00:05:10,188
Cousin.

46
00:05:11,608 --> 00:05:13,648
I need the help of the Three Offices.

47
00:05:15,278 --> 00:05:17,778
The Queen Dowager headed
for the King's Office

48
00:05:17,868 --> 00:05:19,238
without consulting the Royal Court.

49
00:05:19,828 --> 00:05:21,118
His Majesty is still alive.

50
00:05:21,198 --> 00:05:23,828
She cannot be allowed to claim regency.

51
00:05:24,788 --> 00:05:26,788
If the Royal Court
come together and intervene,

52
00:05:26,878 --> 00:05:30,048
the Queen Dowager won't have
a justification to push ahead.

53
00:05:32,378 --> 00:05:34,968
Councilor Park is gathering
the opinions of the Three Offices.

54
00:05:36,968 --> 00:05:39,638
Councilor Park is doing that?

55
00:05:45,688 --> 00:05:47,438
-Mother.
-Will the Queen Dowager

56
00:05:47,518 --> 00:05:49,228
really claim a regency?

57
00:05:49,318 --> 00:05:52,568
No, the entire Royal Court is
in an attempt to stop her.

58
00:05:53,278 --> 00:05:54,358
Mother.

59
00:05:56,238 --> 00:05:57,488
Listen up, Namsang.

60
00:05:57,568 --> 00:06:00,698
You cannot meddle with this business.

61
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:03,578
No matter what happens,

62
00:06:04,868 --> 00:06:06,958
stay low and just keep a watch.

63
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,088
Promise me.

64
00:06:11,748 --> 00:06:13,258
It's your mother's wish.

65
00:06:15,548 --> 00:06:17,968
I'm simply performing my duty
as an officer.

66
00:06:18,338 --> 00:06:19,718
Don't worry.

67
00:06:20,678 --> 00:06:22,308
You must do as I say.

68
00:06:23,018 --> 00:06:24,518
If I lose you,

69
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:27,558
there is no way I can go on.

70
00:06:32,188 --> 00:06:35,318
<i>I will give you a written order.
Bring me the troop dispatch token.</i>

71
00:06:44,748 --> 00:06:46,158
We're in a state of emergency.

72
00:06:46,248 --> 00:06:47,958
Until His Majesty issues an order,

73
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:51,498
the Office of Seals and Badges will be
under the watch of Ministry of Defense.

74
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:55,508
The Queen Dowager made an attempt
to take the troop dispatch token.

75
00:06:56,088 --> 00:06:59,008
Also block the muster roll and
Ministry of Defense's personnel records.

76
00:06:59,088 --> 00:07:00,048
Yes.

77
00:07:05,678 --> 00:07:07,388
I cannot have that either?

78
00:07:07,478 --> 00:07:10,478
-Was that also Councilor Park's order?
-Yes.

79
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:12,938
However,

80
00:07:13,018 --> 00:07:16,358
how does Councilor Park know
every order you made?

81
00:07:44,968 --> 00:07:48,098
<i>This is not something
Her Highness can try alone.</i>

82
00:07:48,888 --> 00:07:52,398
<i>I know someone is working behind her.</i>

83
00:08:08,198 --> 00:08:09,958
<i>Who are you?</i>

84
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:17,758
Thank you for stopping
the Office of Seals and Badges.

85
00:08:18,628 --> 00:08:22,298
It's my duty as an officer
in charge of palace security.

86
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:25,258
Will the Queen Dowager

87
00:08:26,348 --> 00:08:28,468
truly take the path of a rebel?

88
00:08:29,178 --> 00:08:32,388
She wanted the troop dispatch token
to muster the governor's soldiers.

89
00:08:33,688 --> 00:08:35,108
This is nothing but treason.

90
00:08:36,858 --> 00:08:38,068
I doubt

91
00:08:39,068 --> 00:08:41,988
Her Highness thought too much about it.

92
00:08:42,568 --> 00:08:43,608
You're right.

93
00:08:44,698 --> 00:08:46,578
This is not something
she can come up with.

94
00:08:47,488 --> 00:08:49,658
An elder among the subjects
or the royal family

95
00:08:50,118 --> 00:08:51,828
must be behind her.

96
00:08:53,078 --> 00:08:54,918
The entire Royal Court must have noticed

97
00:08:54,998 --> 00:08:57,748
that you and the Queen Dowager
have turned on each other,

98
00:08:58,248 --> 00:09:01,758
as well as how
she took the hand of another.

99
00:09:03,798 --> 00:09:05,178
Another.

100
00:09:08,638 --> 00:09:12,888
If there really is such a person,
they will show themselves soon.

101
00:09:23,238 --> 00:09:24,238
Wait.

102
00:09:24,858 --> 00:09:26,448
Is that not a monk?

103
00:09:27,238 --> 00:09:29,448
How dare a lowly monk be allowed in?

104
00:09:29,538 --> 00:09:32,908
The late King prohibited monks
from even entering the city.

105
00:09:33,538 --> 00:09:35,538
The Queen Dowager must have called.

106
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,878
This is nothing but grievous.

107
00:10:08,068 --> 00:10:09,908
It cannot be someone as petty as you.

108
00:10:25,798 --> 00:10:27,798
Find out more about that monk.

109
00:10:28,548 --> 00:10:31,428
Do not miss anything about him.

110
00:10:31,508 --> 00:10:32,888
Yes, Councilor Park.

111
00:10:47,858 --> 00:10:49,988
Have you ever been abandoned?

112
00:10:51,868 --> 00:10:53,698
I was abandoned at birth.

113
00:10:54,748 --> 00:10:57,578
When the cold wind blew, my mother
abandoned me as soon as I was born.

114
00:10:58,418 --> 00:11:02,038
Then my father went crazy with gambling
and sold me off.

115
00:11:03,248 --> 00:11:04,298
You also

116
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:07,718
had to survive all by yourself.

117
00:11:14,218 --> 00:11:16,808
Many in the palace are abandoned.

118
00:11:17,388 --> 00:11:18,388
I plan

119
00:11:19,438 --> 00:11:21,098
on gathering them.

120
00:11:22,398 --> 00:11:24,108
Those who are abandoned.

121
00:11:24,188 --> 00:11:26,568
Those who are alone.

122
00:11:29,658 --> 00:11:32,778
Those who will do anything
to make sure they aren't abandoned.

123
00:11:34,948 --> 00:11:36,038
Hyekang.

124
00:11:37,118 --> 00:11:38,118
Yes, Your Highness.

125
00:11:41,038 --> 00:11:42,128
What

126
00:11:43,338 --> 00:11:45,168
should I do?

127
00:11:46,798 --> 00:11:48,048
Your enemy is

128
00:11:49,588 --> 00:11:50,968
Councilor Park Gyewon.

129
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:54,808
He is the one who put you in pain.

130
00:11:55,138 --> 00:11:57,268
He's the one
who lied about protecting you,

131
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:59,978
only to drive out your flesh and blood.

132
00:12:20,788 --> 00:12:21,828
Your Majesty.

133
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,788
The Queen Dowager went to your office

134
00:12:25,748 --> 00:12:27,708
to claim her regency.

135
00:12:28,918 --> 00:12:31,088
On that day, she tried
to take the troop dispatch token,

136
00:12:32,468 --> 00:12:33,758
as well as the muster roll

137
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:37,008
and the personnel records
of the Ministry of Defense.

138
00:12:38,768 --> 00:12:43,018
The Queen Dowager believes
that you will pass away.

139
00:12:46,768 --> 00:12:49,188
Otherwise, she might just kill you.

140
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:52,988
No matter what it is,

141
00:12:54,238 --> 00:12:57,238
it seems like she's making moves
that'll prohibit you from returning alive.

142
00:12:58,618 --> 00:13:00,998
I'm not sure what she will do.

143
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,418
Will she use troops

144
00:13:04,878 --> 00:13:06,668
to have you killed?

145
00:13:08,418 --> 00:13:10,008
Will she move the Royal Court

146
00:13:11,548 --> 00:13:13,468
and send out a false obituary

147
00:13:14,838 --> 00:13:16,848
of your death?

148
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:28,878
Is this a dream?

149
00:14:38,428 --> 00:14:40,008
I don't care if it's a dream.

150
00:14:41,558 --> 00:14:43,638
I'll be disappointed once I wake up,

151
00:14:45,268 --> 00:14:46,308
but I believe

152
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:50,108
you'll wake up one day,
just like this dream.

153
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,048
Are you afraid?

154
00:15:14,918 --> 00:15:16,088
I am afraid.

155
00:15:17,878 --> 00:15:20,048
That I may lose someone again
because of my misjudgment.

156
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:22,468
That the one I lose…

157
00:15:25,098 --> 00:15:26,848
may be you.

158
00:15:32,108 --> 00:15:33,188
I won't

159
00:15:34,608 --> 00:15:38,648
leave your side.

160
00:15:39,988 --> 00:15:41,028
I'll stay with you

161
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:44,408
as long as I live.

162
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:54,378
I will also make that happen.

163
00:15:57,798 --> 00:16:00,128
I will protect you.

164
00:16:03,848 --> 00:16:05,758
I will do that.

165
00:16:54,688 --> 00:16:55,728
Your Majesty.

166
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:02,108
Your Majesty, are you awake?

167
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:12,408
Is anybody out there?

168
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:13,668
His Majesty is…

169
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:19,298
Did you call for me, Your Highness?

170
00:17:26,468 --> 00:17:27,598
Never mind.

171
00:17:27,678 --> 00:17:29,218
I must have seen something wrong.

172
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:32,558
You may leave.

173
00:17:46,568 --> 00:17:48,328
You woke up.

174
00:18:10,348 --> 00:18:12,138
-Did you look into it?
-Yes,

175
00:18:12,218 --> 00:18:14,678
but the royal physician
did not show any suspicious moves.

176
00:18:16,648 --> 00:18:20,978
Does he really not know
that His Majesty woke up?

177
00:18:21,478 --> 00:18:24,438
His life and future
depend on His Majesty's health.

178
00:18:24,528 --> 00:18:27,778
He won't be able to speak up
until His Majesty fully recovers.

179
00:18:28,448 --> 00:18:31,278
But what if the physician is
with Councilor Park or the Queen Dowager?

180
00:18:31,868 --> 00:18:32,908
Your Highness.

181
00:18:33,498 --> 00:18:35,658
You should let His Majesty
recuperate outside the palace.

182
00:18:37,078 --> 00:18:40,168
He may fall in bigger danger
if he leaves the palace.

183
00:18:40,248 --> 00:18:42,918
If the Queen Dowager
makes an attempt to kill him,

184
00:18:43,508 --> 00:18:45,588
she'll do it quietly
within the palace walls.

185
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:48,968
We still do not know
which side the military took.

186
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:53,178
If we have any troops
we can trust outside the palace,

187
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:55,228
then maybe…

188
00:18:55,808 --> 00:18:58,348
I have the troop dispatch token
for Jeolla Province.

189
00:19:00,308 --> 00:19:01,558
You do?

190
00:19:01,648 --> 00:19:04,188
We can make use of the troops
in Jeolla Province,

191
00:19:04,278 --> 00:19:05,738
so you should let him leave the palace.

192
00:19:06,318 --> 00:19:08,028
On the day His Majesty collapsed,

193
00:19:08,108 --> 00:19:11,158
he heard that there were many bandits
on the way to Jeolla Province,

194
00:19:11,238 --> 00:19:14,488
so he asked me to bring the token
for the governor of Jeolla Province.

195
00:19:14,578 --> 00:19:16,078
Then things became hectic,

196
00:19:16,158 --> 00:19:18,868
so even the Office of Seals and Badges
didn't notice one is missing.

197
00:19:21,498 --> 00:19:22,588
Your Highness.

198
00:19:22,668 --> 00:19:24,248
I await your order.

199
00:19:33,598 --> 00:19:36,178
I shall move His Majesty
outside the palace.

200
00:19:41,018 --> 00:19:43,568
I have fully carried out
your previous order.

201
00:19:44,148 --> 00:19:47,528
I picked out only the ones
who can lay down their lives for you.

202
00:19:47,608 --> 00:19:50,858
Please trust us eunuchs.

203
00:19:51,448 --> 00:19:54,158
Tell the chief royal secretary
to get ready to receive me

204
00:19:54,738 --> 00:19:57,118
for I shall leave for the royal office.

205
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:01,618
I, Chief Eunuch Heo Deukyoung,

206
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:04,878
shall bear the order
of Her Highness the Queen Dowager.

207
00:20:07,878 --> 00:20:09,628
Your Highness the Queen Dowager!

208
00:20:09,718 --> 00:20:14,758
Please withdraw your will
to act as a regent!

209
00:20:14,848 --> 00:20:17,138
-Please withdraw your will
-Please withdraw your will

210
00:20:17,218 --> 00:20:19,268
-to act as a regent!
-to act as a regent!

211
00:20:19,348 --> 00:20:23,648
Please withdraw your will
to act as a regent!

212
00:20:23,728 --> 00:20:25,648
-Please withdraw your will
-Please withdraw your will

213
00:20:25,728 --> 00:20:28,278
-to act as a regent!
-to act as a regent!

214
00:20:33,158 --> 00:20:35,158
We can no longer turn a blind eye to this.

215
00:20:35,238 --> 00:20:38,448
We must make an appeal
and protest against her wrongful behavior.

216
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:40,908
We can't simply lodge an appeal.

217
00:20:42,288 --> 00:20:44,208
All Three Offices must come together

218
00:20:44,668 --> 00:20:46,998
and stop the Queen Dowager
from doing this.

219
00:20:57,138 --> 00:20:59,808
A word for the chief scholar
of the Office of Special Advisors.

220
00:20:59,888 --> 00:21:03,768
The Queen Dowager wishes to meet you.

221
00:21:06,818 --> 00:21:08,528
All Three Offices at once?

222
00:21:09,398 --> 00:21:11,818
After all, you will just threaten me?

223
00:21:11,898 --> 00:21:13,318
Please pardon my words,

224
00:21:13,988 --> 00:21:16,658
but you have brought this upon yourself.

225
00:21:17,618 --> 00:21:18,618
Even Your Highness

226
00:21:18,698 --> 00:21:22,748
cannot manage the state affairs
without the proper justification.

227
00:21:24,998 --> 00:21:26,918
I'm sick and tired of that justification.

228
00:21:29,168 --> 00:21:30,548
Drop the blinds.

229
00:22:00,538 --> 00:22:02,078
Father.

230
00:22:02,698 --> 00:22:03,788
What…

231
00:22:04,038 --> 00:22:05,748
What are you doing?

232
00:22:15,718 --> 00:22:18,048
This is my justification.

233
00:22:21,098 --> 00:22:22,718
Your Highness.

234
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:25,438
I'm sure you know
your son is under questioning

235
00:22:25,518 --> 00:22:27,768
for bribing the Queen Dowager.

236
00:22:28,898 --> 00:22:30,898
If he's found guilty after inspection,

237
00:22:31,438 --> 00:22:33,528
he can be dealt with by the law.

238
00:22:33,608 --> 00:22:36,818
How do you go against the law
and punish him personally?

239
00:22:37,858 --> 00:22:39,528
Your son's bribe was

240
00:22:40,528 --> 00:22:42,698
helpful for you
in becoming the chief scholar.

241
00:22:45,538 --> 00:22:47,118
That is a false accusation!

242
00:22:53,838 --> 00:22:55,338
Before you're vindicated,

243
00:22:55,418 --> 00:22:57,428
your honor will be trampled on the ground.

244
00:22:57,508 --> 00:22:59,968
The Sarim will spit on your name.

245
00:23:03,888 --> 00:23:05,638
What will you do now?

246
00:23:09,228 --> 00:23:12,438
Even if you ask me 100 times,
my answer is the same.

247
00:23:13,938 --> 00:23:15,568
I cannot make

248
00:23:16,148 --> 00:23:19,238
a dogmatic decision
on the will of the Three Offices.

249
00:23:22,528 --> 00:23:23,908
Father…

250
00:23:26,288 --> 00:23:27,618
-Father…
-No…

251
00:23:41,258 --> 00:23:42,968
I ask you once again.

252
00:23:45,138 --> 00:23:46,848
This is the last time.

253
00:23:48,888 --> 00:23:50,688
Give me a wise answer.

254
00:24:06,908 --> 00:24:08,038
My lord.

255
00:24:08,118 --> 00:24:10,078
What did Her Highness say to you?

256
00:24:11,418 --> 00:24:13,998
I'm sure she didn't expect
the Three Offices to come together.

257
00:24:14,878 --> 00:24:17,918
If the Three Offices back down,
Her Highness will also…

258
00:24:29,058 --> 00:24:30,138
My master!

259
00:24:46,578 --> 00:24:50,078
You asked me to show you
what I planned on doing.

260
00:24:51,328 --> 00:24:54,828
I will now tell you what I can give you.

261
00:25:03,758 --> 00:25:07,008
You may not become the Queen,
but you can be the Queen Dowager.

262
00:25:12,138 --> 00:25:13,308
Why do you…

263
00:25:15,938 --> 00:25:18,978
make such an offer to me?

264
00:25:24,738 --> 00:25:26,868
You and I have…

265
00:25:28,868 --> 00:25:30,538
the same enemy.

266
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:34,328
His Majesty is dying.

267
00:25:34,418 --> 00:25:36,788
This is the perfect time
to get rid of Consort Park.

268
00:25:41,378 --> 00:25:43,508
But His Majesty did ingest poison.

269
00:25:43,588 --> 00:25:46,138
Someone must pay for the crime.

270
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:49,678
This will only end…

271
00:25:51,678 --> 00:25:53,098
once someone spills their blood.

272
00:26:07,568 --> 00:26:09,988
Goodness. Right here.

273
00:26:10,538 --> 00:26:11,868
Pass it along.

274
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:16,168
Come on.

275
00:26:17,078 --> 00:26:21,248
You aren't some kid.
Why do you always follow me around?

276
00:26:21,338 --> 00:26:23,798
I thought I would never see you again.

277
00:26:23,878 --> 00:26:27,178
No matter how unsightly you may be,
my paradise is where you are.

278
00:26:27,888 --> 00:26:30,258
Should we have a taste of paradise?

279
00:26:31,598 --> 00:26:32,678
Come on.

280
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:35,138
I'm busy!

281
00:26:39,978 --> 00:26:42,728
You should be sick of each other
after spending every moment together.

282
00:26:43,438 --> 00:26:44,938
Do you adore your wife that much?

283
00:26:46,358 --> 00:26:48,408
If you're jealous,
you can get married again too.

284
00:26:48,488 --> 00:26:50,278
Stop nitpicking over
our loving relationship.

285
00:26:50,368 --> 00:26:52,948
What? You'll miss our delivery deadline
while showing off your love.

286
00:26:53,908 --> 00:26:55,538
Why aren't you doing your job?

287
00:26:56,078 --> 00:26:57,078
Okay.

288
00:26:58,078 --> 00:27:00,128
Without Lady Jeong, our business dwindled,

289
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:01,998
so we don't have much work,
but I'll do it.

290
00:27:07,378 --> 00:27:10,258
I'm not sure
what the new governor is like.

291
00:27:10,338 --> 00:27:13,888
What if he extorts everything from us
as a tribute to get promoted?

292
00:27:13,968 --> 00:27:17,638
I hear he has such a nasty temper
that he doesn't care about his office.

293
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:21,268
He had some bad blood
with the noblemen of Hanyang,

294
00:27:21,898 --> 00:27:24,438
so he always gets appointed
to provinces like Hamgyong or Jeolla.

295
00:27:27,358 --> 00:27:29,068
Then will he let us be?

296
00:27:30,028 --> 00:27:32,068
Is Lady Jeong doing well in Hanyang?

297
00:27:32,698 --> 00:27:34,698
How's everything with the scholar?

298
00:27:34,788 --> 00:27:37,038
Will she visit
no matter how tough her married life is?

299
00:27:40,538 --> 00:27:43,538
You should sweep the floor
instead of following your wife around.

300
00:27:44,378 --> 00:27:45,458
Okay?

301
00:27:47,218 --> 00:27:49,178
Why can't he tell us about Lady Jeong?

302
00:27:49,678 --> 00:27:51,218
If we only had her,

303
00:27:51,298 --> 00:27:53,848
she would have packed up everything

304
00:27:53,928 --> 00:27:57,348
just in time for the appointment
of the queen-to-be or whatever.

305
00:27:57,928 --> 00:28:00,848
He doesn't have a knack for business.

306
00:28:04,818 --> 00:28:06,938
I wonder if Jeong is doing okay.

307
00:28:50,488 --> 00:28:52,818
I heard he hasn't regained consciousness.

308
00:28:53,908 --> 00:28:55,238
I apologize, Your Highness.

309
00:28:55,828 --> 00:28:58,238
It's all due
to the insufficiency of my efforts.

310
00:28:59,288 --> 00:29:00,288
That's why

311
00:29:01,368 --> 00:29:04,538
I request you give me approval
to let His Majesty rest out of the palace.

312
00:29:06,128 --> 00:29:07,798
You wish to take him out of the palace?

313
00:29:09,008 --> 00:29:12,088
Yes, I thought His Majesty might wake up

314
00:29:12,508 --> 00:29:14,588
if he leaves this crowded palace.

315
00:29:16,468 --> 00:29:19,138
<i>Send His Majesty away
to a detached palace nearby.</i>

316
00:29:19,218 --> 00:29:20,768
If he passes in the palace,

317
00:29:20,848 --> 00:29:22,808
his bad luck may reach you, Your Highness.

318
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:25,268
I must keep him close
to keep an eye on him.

319
00:29:25,728 --> 00:29:26,978
If he wakes up--

320
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:29,318
His Majesty will never wake up.

321
00:29:29,778 --> 00:29:31,398
Please trust me.

322
00:29:33,028 --> 00:29:34,198
Send him out of the palace

323
00:29:34,278 --> 00:29:36,948
and let the people know that
there can be national mourning.

324
00:29:38,578 --> 00:29:40,868
If His Majesty's imminent death is
made known,

325
00:29:41,828 --> 00:29:44,248
<i>you will be given more power.</i>

326
00:29:49,248 --> 00:29:51,378
I accept your request, Consort Park.

327
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:53,298
I thank you for your kindness.

328
00:30:37,758 --> 00:30:38,888
Please punish me.

329
00:30:40,428 --> 00:30:43,138
I lost balance for a moment.

330
00:30:45,308 --> 00:30:47,558
You must learn
to rule over your subjects first.

331
00:30:49,398 --> 00:30:52,068
I apologize, Your Highness.
I will have her punished severely.

332
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:33,268
Are you all right?

333
00:31:34,148 --> 00:31:35,738
It doesn't hurt that much.

334
00:31:42,948 --> 00:31:44,488
Since when did you know?

335
00:31:45,078 --> 00:31:46,748
It has not been a while.

336
00:31:47,328 --> 00:31:48,748
Who else knows?

337
00:31:49,328 --> 00:31:50,458
Just me.

338
00:31:53,788 --> 00:31:55,798
I couldn't trust you either.

339
00:31:55,878 --> 00:31:57,468
Do not trust me.

340
00:31:59,218 --> 00:32:01,718
That's the only way
you'll survive and protect him.

341
00:32:03,928 --> 00:32:06,218
However, please give me your trust
for just one day

342
00:32:07,518 --> 00:32:09,438
and sleep in peace.

343
00:32:25,658 --> 00:32:26,868
Thank you.

344
00:32:41,838 --> 00:32:42,968
Poor Miss.

345
00:32:43,338 --> 00:32:45,548
She has one lousy fate.

346
00:32:45,888 --> 00:32:47,928
You're breaking my heart.

347
00:32:49,808 --> 00:32:51,058
Good grief.

348
00:32:51,888 --> 00:32:52,898
Miss.

349
00:32:53,558 --> 00:32:54,688
Ttonggeum.

350
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:56,398
Listen to me carefully.

351
00:32:57,688 --> 00:33:00,488
Starting now,
there's something you must do.

352
00:33:25,468 --> 00:33:27,558
I heard he's going out of the palace.

353
00:33:28,428 --> 00:33:29,678
If he leaves,

354
00:33:29,768 --> 00:33:32,848
the security won't be
as high as the palace.

355
00:33:33,728 --> 00:33:37,358
I mean that His Majesty may
fall in bigger danger.

356
00:33:38,358 --> 00:33:41,608
The Queen Dowager
gave me her approval to leave with him.

357
00:33:41,688 --> 00:33:45,028
If the Queen Dowager
gave you the approval to let him leave,

358
00:33:45,318 --> 00:33:46,448
I believe

359
00:33:46,528 --> 00:33:50,488
the security outside of the palace is
much laxer than the palace.

360
00:33:52,328 --> 00:33:53,958
You already know.

361
00:33:54,538 --> 00:33:58,288
The Queen Dowager is
only waiting for His Majesty to pass.

362
00:34:01,298 --> 00:34:04,508
But you still wanted to leave
despite knowing that fact.

363
00:34:04,838 --> 00:34:06,088
It means

364
00:34:06,298 --> 00:34:10,718
you considered that he'll be safer outside
than within the palace walls.

365
00:34:14,768 --> 00:34:17,018
The Royal Seal and stamps
represent His Majesty.

366
00:34:17,308 --> 00:34:20,228
I will make sure
he can take everything with him.

367
00:34:21,478 --> 00:34:23,738
My servants will keep your journey safe

368
00:34:24,318 --> 00:34:26,568
in every corner to the detached palace.

369
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:30,488
Are you keeping a watch on him?

370
00:34:32,788 --> 00:34:33,828
I am

371
00:34:34,328 --> 00:34:36,328
only trying to protect His Majesty.

372
00:34:43,088 --> 00:34:45,588
I trust that you sincerely wish

373
00:34:46,838 --> 00:34:48,588
for His Majesty to wake up.

374
00:36:15,718 --> 00:36:16,678
Consort Park.

375
00:36:23,188 --> 00:36:24,318
Open up.

376
00:36:36,408 --> 00:36:38,288
You cannot leave.

377
00:36:40,708 --> 00:36:42,248
It is an order by the Queen Dowager.

378
00:36:57,718 --> 00:36:59,308
I'm sure there is a reason.

379
00:36:59,388 --> 00:37:01,768
Yes, there is.

380
00:37:03,228 --> 00:37:05,398
The Queen Dowager received
an anonymous letter.

381
00:37:06,728 --> 00:37:07,728
An anonymous letter?

382
00:37:08,568 --> 00:37:11,448
That you assumed someone else's identity

383
00:37:12,108 --> 00:37:13,568
and tried to kill His Majesty,

384
00:37:13,658 --> 00:37:15,528
afraid that your crime will become known.

385
00:37:19,238 --> 00:37:21,658
We all know that
this is just absurd slander.

386
00:37:22,328 --> 00:37:23,168
That's why

387
00:37:23,248 --> 00:37:26,878
the Queen Dowager wishes to catch
the real culprit and clear your charges,

388
00:37:27,538 --> 00:37:30,418
so she asks you to stay
in your abode until she's done.

389
00:37:32,758 --> 00:37:35,678
I know someone
who might be the real culprit.

390
00:37:37,178 --> 00:37:40,518
There was someone who went on
about how she knew you.

391
00:37:42,728 --> 00:37:43,728
The servant girl

392
00:37:43,888 --> 00:37:45,768
I brought from my family.

393
00:37:50,478 --> 00:37:51,778
Bring Ttonggeum in!

394
00:38:02,078 --> 00:38:03,368
She's not here right now.

395
00:38:18,548 --> 00:38:20,058
<i>While the procession leaves,</i>

396
00:38:20,138 --> 00:38:21,888
hide in the secret passage.

397
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:25,938
When things get quiet around you,
run away to Bamboo Grove Village.

398
00:38:26,518 --> 00:38:27,688
When you meet Master Lim,

399
00:38:28,268 --> 00:38:30,978
tell him to make sure everyone leaves
the Bamboo Grove Village.

400
00:38:31,818 --> 00:38:32,898
Okay?

401
00:38:38,818 --> 00:38:39,778
Gone?

402
00:38:39,868 --> 00:38:42,078
She ran away out of the palace?

403
00:38:42,158 --> 00:38:43,498
I don't think that's the case.

404
00:38:44,038 --> 00:38:45,328
According to the court ladies,

405
00:38:45,408 --> 00:38:48,038
she disappeared
after Consort Park gave her an errand

406
00:38:48,128 --> 00:38:49,708
to bring a book from the library.

407
00:38:50,088 --> 00:38:52,378
The library, you say.

408
00:39:49,188 --> 00:39:51,058
Please spare me!

409
00:40:05,198 --> 00:40:06,828
How dare you stand in her way?

410
00:40:06,908 --> 00:40:08,038
Move aside immediately.

411
00:40:13,918 --> 00:40:18,298
The Queen Dowager asks you to return.

412
00:40:18,878 --> 00:40:21,338
Let her know that I must see her.

413
00:40:22,468 --> 00:40:24,678
How impudent.

414
00:40:29,178 --> 00:40:30,688
If you refuse to return,

415
00:40:31,438 --> 00:40:33,358
that is what she told me to relay to you.

416
00:40:39,698 --> 00:40:40,898
Let's go.

417
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:43,698
Even if you see her,
she won't let you leave.

418
00:41:00,878 --> 00:41:02,588
Do you feel sick?

419
00:41:02,968 --> 00:41:04,088
Should I call the physician?

420
00:41:05,098 --> 00:41:06,138
No.

421
00:41:07,308 --> 00:41:09,178
I must be getting too sensitive.

422
00:41:14,938 --> 00:41:17,268
You need to contact Chief Eunuch Jung.

423
00:41:19,028 --> 00:41:21,148
Eumjeon, find out
if Ttonggeum left the palace fine.

424
00:41:21,738 --> 00:41:23,068
If she left safely,

425
00:41:23,158 --> 00:41:25,698
she would have hung white cloth
on the first tree by the West Gate.

426
00:41:33,538 --> 00:41:36,378
Even if you must bribe the guards,
you need to check.

427
00:41:37,708 --> 00:41:38,998
Yes, Your Highness.

428
00:41:54,898 --> 00:41:57,358
How did you become this pathetic?

429
00:42:00,778 --> 00:42:01,818
My lady.

430
00:42:03,318 --> 00:42:06,318
Please… Please spare me.

431
00:42:09,078 --> 00:42:10,578
You dared to despise me,

432
00:42:10,948 --> 00:42:12,618
and you're now begging me for life?

433
00:42:12,998 --> 00:42:14,748
Even beasts recognize their masters.

434
00:42:15,208 --> 00:42:16,918
You're worse than beasts.

435
00:42:18,538 --> 00:42:20,588
I am sorry.

436
00:42:20,918 --> 00:42:24,168
I deserve to die for what I did.

437
00:42:24,758 --> 00:42:25,798
Yes.

438
00:42:26,758 --> 00:42:29,598
You know what you did wrong,
so I'll tell you how you can live.

439
00:42:31,968 --> 00:42:33,058
Yes.

440
00:42:33,268 --> 00:42:35,308
Yes, I'll do anything.

441
00:42:37,228 --> 00:42:40,768
You sent an anonymous letter
to the Queen Dowager.

442
00:42:41,068 --> 00:42:43,898
Of course, I sent one.

443
00:42:44,738 --> 00:42:46,278
You wrote that

444
00:42:46,358 --> 00:42:49,068
Consort Park lied about her identity
and called herself noble,

445
00:42:49,698 --> 00:42:52,118
then turned in a false name
with her profile.

446
00:42:52,698 --> 00:42:54,498
When she was caught,

447
00:42:54,578 --> 00:42:57,868
you said Consort Park
tried to kill His Majesty.

448
00:43:05,088 --> 00:43:07,008
This is what
the Queen Dowager wants you to say.

449
00:43:08,048 --> 00:43:09,928
Remember, and give that answer.

450
00:43:12,808 --> 00:43:14,058
Then…

451
00:43:14,638 --> 00:43:15,888
you will be able to survive.

452
00:43:32,988 --> 00:43:33,988
Do you understand?

453
00:43:38,578 --> 00:43:39,618
How dare you!

454
00:43:42,498 --> 00:43:43,838
I've always been

455
00:43:44,418 --> 00:43:47,338
a beast to you, haven't I?

456
00:43:49,298 --> 00:43:51,508
You'd throw away your food in the toilet,

457
00:43:51,968 --> 00:43:55,848
so I picked it up after you
and ate that as I grew up.

458
00:43:58,558 --> 00:44:00,808
If I'm a beast anyway,

459
00:44:01,648 --> 00:44:03,108
then I will

460
00:44:04,148 --> 00:44:05,568
act like one.

461
00:44:06,818 --> 00:44:09,648
Sure. Go ahead and get beaten up
as much as you want.

462
00:44:10,608 --> 00:44:14,788
You will realize how fortunate you were
to have a master like me.

463
00:44:16,578 --> 00:44:17,658
Take her away.

464
00:44:30,928 --> 00:44:34,678
What if Ttonggeum denies this to the end?

465
00:44:35,178 --> 00:44:36,718
Don't worry.

466
00:44:37,678 --> 00:44:41,688
Dealing with a girl like that
is nothing at all.

467
00:44:42,228 --> 00:44:43,808
Once she goes in there,

468
00:44:43,898 --> 00:44:45,358
she'll end up

469
00:44:46,188 --> 00:44:50,108
selling her parents and even her siblings.

470
00:45:06,668 --> 00:45:09,258
We'll end up having a royal funeral.

471
00:45:09,758 --> 00:45:13,298
It seems like there is not a lot of chance
for His Majesty to survive.

472
00:45:13,388 --> 00:45:16,638
The Queen Dowager even stopped
Consort Park from escorting him.

473
00:45:17,468 --> 00:45:18,598
What's going on?

474
00:45:18,678 --> 00:45:19,888
Anyway.

475
00:45:20,808 --> 00:45:24,398
Remember that Councilor Park told you
not to come to the office

476
00:45:24,938 --> 00:45:28,108
as a means of protest
by the regency of the Queen Dowager.

477
00:45:35,908 --> 00:45:37,078
Councilor Park.

478
00:45:38,408 --> 00:45:39,538
Goodness.

479
00:45:39,618 --> 00:45:42,368
<i>Exclude those who will take
Councilor Park's side to the end.</i>

480
00:45:42,458 --> 00:45:44,578
<i>-Left Minister No Kyungmoon.</i>
-Things are so hectic…

481
00:45:44,668 --> 00:45:46,418
<i>Minister of Taxation Park Chanwe.</i>

482
00:45:46,498 --> 00:45:47,958
<i>Left Vice Minister Ko Inhyuk.</i>

483
00:45:48,038 --> 00:45:49,668
<i>Minister of Commerce Im Joyong.</i>

484
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:52,468
<i>But to other royal subjects,</i>

485
00:45:53,168 --> 00:45:56,798
<i>you can announce that you are an elder
who'll work with the officers.</i>

486
00:46:01,138 --> 00:46:03,848
I do not wish
to stand against the officers.

487
00:46:04,768 --> 00:46:06,648
Because the King is unable to live,

488
00:46:06,728 --> 00:46:08,358
I only wish to act as a regent.

489
00:46:09,018 --> 00:46:11,688
Royal subjects, accept
the will of the Queen Dowager.

490
00:46:16,698 --> 00:46:19,158
<i>This is to rebuild
the foundation of our nation.</i>

491
00:46:19,618 --> 00:46:23,118
<i>If you do not join me,
how can you be called a loyal subject?</i>

492
00:46:25,748 --> 00:46:28,458
<i>Come to the royal office
and accept the regency.</i>

493
00:46:28,998 --> 00:46:30,878
<i>Those who are
at the royal office will receive</i>

494
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:34,008
<i>a chance to recommend
the successor of His Majesty.</i>

495
00:46:37,928 --> 00:46:39,428
<i>You will get a chance</i>

496
00:46:40,718 --> 00:46:44,478
<i>to choose the successor of His Majesty.</i>

497
00:47:19,178 --> 00:47:22,508
How can she send
such a letter to the subjects?

498
00:47:23,308 --> 00:47:26,388
And when will the Three Offices
make a statement together?

499
00:47:27,348 --> 00:47:29,098
Is the chief scholar still sick?

500
00:47:29,688 --> 00:47:30,768
Yes.

501
00:47:30,858 --> 00:47:33,858
He hurt his forehead badly,
so he cannot come to work.

502
00:47:34,528 --> 00:47:36,318
Do you expect me to believe that?

503
00:47:38,028 --> 00:47:40,448
If he didn't have legs,
he's the type to crawl here if he must.

504
00:47:41,238 --> 00:47:42,328
Good grief.

505
00:47:42,408 --> 00:47:45,618
This is all too mysterious.
Too mysterious.

506
00:47:51,418 --> 00:47:53,628
I cannot believe
the absurdity of this letter.

507
00:47:53,708 --> 00:47:56,508
The Queen Dowager must think
the subjects are a joke.

508
00:47:57,338 --> 00:47:59,428
Will you be at the royal office?

509
00:48:07,348 --> 00:48:08,348
Father.

510
00:48:09,138 --> 00:48:11,188
I must find out who fell for this scheme.

511
00:48:12,558 --> 00:48:14,688
His Majesty is out recovering.
What? A successor?

512
00:48:15,978 --> 00:48:17,648
How can she be this ludicrous?

513
00:48:25,788 --> 00:48:26,998
What is it?

514
00:48:31,078 --> 00:48:34,248
Are you headed for the royal office?

515
00:48:34,878 --> 00:48:37,008
I wish to meet Councilor Park.

516
00:48:37,088 --> 00:48:38,048
Why?

517
00:48:38,378 --> 00:48:40,798
All subjects must go
to the royal office right now.

518
00:48:42,798 --> 00:48:44,638
I must stop the Queen Dowager now.

519
00:48:45,468 --> 00:48:46,718
You'll do that?

520
00:48:47,518 --> 00:48:49,928
I'm in charge of the palace's security.

521
00:48:50,018 --> 00:48:53,978
I cannot condone
the Queen Dowager's acts any longer.

522
00:49:03,108 --> 00:49:04,868
Don't go, Father.

523
00:49:07,868 --> 00:49:09,248
Lady Cho.

524
00:49:10,658 --> 00:49:13,578
Please… help me.

525
00:50:26,528 --> 00:50:28,028
Remove the blind.

526
00:51:06,028 --> 00:51:07,698
I do not care
about hiding behind the blind.

527
00:51:09,068 --> 00:51:11,158
I will simply rule over you.

528
00:51:20,628 --> 00:51:23,128
This is the first order of my first day.

529
00:51:23,708 --> 00:51:26,168
-Give us your order.
-Give us your order.

530
00:51:28,128 --> 00:51:31,218
There is something that interferes
with the landscape of my garden.

531
00:51:34,518 --> 00:51:35,928
Plow the rice paddy up…

532
00:51:39,648 --> 00:51:40,978
from the garden.

533
00:51:46,858 --> 00:51:50,158
-Your order is our command.
-Your order is our command.

534
00:51:56,158 --> 00:51:58,748
<i>This is not something
Her Highness can try alone.</i>

535
00:52:00,498 --> 00:52:04,248
<i>I know someone is working behind her.</i>

536
00:52:08,508 --> 00:52:11,968
So he arrived at the detached palace
without any trouble?

537
00:52:12,048 --> 00:52:14,888
Yes, it's a huge relief.

538
00:52:19,688 --> 00:52:21,648
Send someone to Chief Eunuch Jung.

539
00:52:22,358 --> 00:52:24,148
Tell him I'll find a way to leave,

540
00:52:24,228 --> 00:52:26,278
so don't worry about me
and protect His Majesty.

541
00:52:26,358 --> 00:52:27,398
Yes.

542
00:52:28,698 --> 00:52:30,818
Your Highness the Consort!

543
00:52:33,658 --> 00:52:35,238
Why are you making a fuss
before Her Highness?

544
00:52:37,618 --> 00:52:38,658
What should I do?

545
00:52:39,618 --> 00:52:42,628
There was no white cloth by the West Gate.

546
00:52:43,708 --> 00:52:44,788
I don't think

547
00:52:45,878 --> 00:52:47,378
Ttonggeum left.

548
00:52:49,718 --> 00:52:50,798
What?

549
00:52:52,388 --> 00:52:54,508
Are you sure the guard checked everything?

550
00:52:55,388 --> 00:52:56,558
Yes.

551
00:53:00,058 --> 00:53:01,888
What should we do now?

552
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:04,768
It looks like she's still in the palace.

553
00:53:05,768 --> 00:53:08,648
Someone said they saw her
getting dragged by eunuchs.

554
00:53:08,738 --> 00:53:10,068
It must be true.

555
00:53:55,068 --> 00:53:58,788
Will my unfortunate life
finally turn around today?

556
00:53:59,078 --> 00:54:03,998
The father of Maitreya will
take everything today!

557
00:54:13,878 --> 00:54:17,138
Who's the father of Maitreya?

558
00:54:24,848 --> 00:54:26,348
Safe travels.

559
00:54:33,988 --> 00:54:38,318
Is it true he survived ten days
without a drop of water?

560
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:40,198
I do not know.

561
00:54:42,158 --> 00:54:47,038
If he lives,
it must mean he really is the Maitreya…

562
00:54:48,038 --> 00:54:50,498
but I've never seen a genuine one

563
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:53,508
of all the phonies
who called themselves the Maitreya.

564
00:55:37,088 --> 00:55:38,258
Who are you?

565
00:56:57,378 --> 00:56:58,338
Speak.

566
00:56:58,418 --> 00:57:01,128
I sold that kid off when I was a kid.

567
00:57:01,218 --> 00:57:03,258
How would I know what he did?

568
00:57:03,678 --> 00:57:06,468
I may be his father, but how would I know?

569
00:57:06,808 --> 00:57:08,178
You don't have more information?

570
00:57:08,978 --> 00:57:11,768
That means I'll no longer need you.

571
00:57:11,848 --> 00:57:12,938
Sorry?

572
00:57:14,728 --> 00:57:17,528
There are a few others who might know!

573
00:57:17,728 --> 00:57:20,238
If you find the gamblers who bought him,

574
00:57:20,318 --> 00:57:23,448
you'll find out who took him
and brought him up.

575
00:57:24,488 --> 00:57:26,488
So someone else brought him up?

576
00:57:26,578 --> 00:57:31,038
Yes, there was this guy
who took the kid from the gamblers.

577
00:58:04,658 --> 00:58:06,198
Who is it?

578
00:58:06,278 --> 00:58:08,618
I really don't know!

579
00:58:12,158 --> 00:58:15,328
I heard that he should have
a huge scar on his hand.

580
00:58:18,668 --> 00:58:20,798
I'm sure he has a huge scar.

581
00:58:20,878 --> 00:58:23,418
He got hurt to the point
he almost lost his hand

582
00:58:23,508 --> 00:58:25,378
<i>just to save that kid.</i>

583
00:58:57,378 --> 00:58:58,918
Jung Euikyun.

584
00:59:02,588 --> 00:59:04,918
I told you to be careful
not to leave your lower body open.

585
00:59:05,678 --> 00:59:07,218
You haven't fixed it yet.

586
00:59:13,598 --> 00:59:15,178
Are you all right?

587
00:59:18,228 --> 00:59:19,358
Siwol.

588
00:59:24,068 --> 00:59:25,188
Of course.

589
00:59:27,148 --> 00:59:28,158
Father.

590
01:00:54,328 --> 01:00:57,328
BLOODY HEART

591
01:01:18,848 --> 01:01:21,098
Were you the one
who fooled the Queen Dowager,

592
01:01:21,728 --> 01:01:23,648
<i>Your Majesty?</i>

593
01:01:23,728 --> 01:01:25,108
<i>When you were out in disguise,</i>

594
01:01:25,188 --> 01:01:27,018
<i>weren't there those
who attacked Consort Park?</i>

595
01:01:27,108 --> 01:01:28,278
<i>It was by the Queen Dowager's order.</i>

596
01:01:28,358 --> 01:01:30,358
<i>There are not many options for you,
Minister Cho.</i>

597
01:01:30,438 --> 01:01:32,318
Either become a traitor
along with your daughter,

598
01:01:32,398 --> 01:01:34,448
<i>or eliminate
Councilor Park and Consort Park.</i>

599
01:01:34,528 --> 01:01:37,868
Things are looking bad.
I will find you a way out.

600
01:01:37,948 --> 01:01:39,618
<i>Ttonggeum is still trapped.</i>

601
01:01:39,698 --> 01:01:42,158
<i>I can no longer leave Consort Park
alone in the palace.</i>

602
01:01:42,248 --> 01:01:46,628
<i>You dare intrude on the royal office
just because of a servant?</i>

603
01:01:46,708 --> 01:01:47,878
Remove her!

604
01:01:47,958 --> 01:01:49,418
I am…

605
01:01:50,128 --> 01:01:52,798
with child of His Majesty's blood.
