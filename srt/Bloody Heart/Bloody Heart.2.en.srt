00:00:42,218 --> 00:00:46,178
BLOODY HEART

2
00:00:46,258 --> 00:00:49,178
THE PEOPLE, GROUPS, PLACES, AND INCIDENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE PURELY FICTIONAL

3
00:01:52,748 --> 00:01:54,208
You are already as good as dead.

4
00:01:54,288 --> 00:01:56,498
What if someone recognizes you?
You should not have come!

5
00:01:56,578 --> 00:01:58,708
I should at least
retrieve my parents' bodies.

6
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:03,968
How can they rest if they are not buried?

7
00:02:04,048 --> 00:02:07,048
The crows have probably
left them unrecognizable.

8
00:02:07,638 --> 00:02:10,548
If you have come to the capital
foolishly blinded by revenge,

9
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:12,008
head back this instant.

10
00:02:17,138 --> 00:02:18,398
Then who…

11
00:02:19,898 --> 00:02:21,518
do I get back at for this?

12
00:02:25,648 --> 00:02:27,358
The meritorious subjects

13
00:02:27,858 --> 00:02:30,278
who destroyed my family
to annihilate the Sarim?

14
00:02:30,368 --> 00:02:31,408
Or should it be…

15
00:02:33,908 --> 00:02:35,868
His Majesty…

16
00:02:37,828 --> 00:02:40,878
who framed my father
in order to protect the Crown Prince?

17
00:02:48,548 --> 00:02:50,088
Who…

18
00:02:53,968 --> 00:02:56,308
should be the target of my revenge?

19
00:03:54,988 --> 00:03:56,828
<i>Even so, I will live.</i>

20
00:03:57,868 --> 00:04:02,578
<i>I'll live and torture the ones
who slaughtered those dear to me.</i>

21
00:04:04,998 --> 00:04:06,798
<i>So please, stay alive.</i>

22
00:04:07,758 --> 00:04:10,758
<i>Please live and endure.</i>

23
00:04:12,388 --> 00:04:15,678
<i>I will choose to live, my lord.</i>

24
00:04:17,518 --> 00:04:19,558
<i>You have saved me from death</i>

25
00:04:20,678 --> 00:04:23,268
<i>and I will use that second chance to live</i>

26
00:04:24,358 --> 00:04:25,608
<i>for those who need me.</i>

27
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:39,498
BLOODY HEART
EPISODE 2

28
00:04:50,168 --> 00:04:53,088
I figured there was a chance
of you not coming today.

29
00:04:53,718 --> 00:04:56,348
Then you should have left
which is what I always say.

30
00:04:57,218 --> 00:04:59,768
Well, you always make it.

31
00:05:17,528 --> 00:05:18,618
You are truly stunning.

32
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:32,128
Are you not the one
who lectured me about it being worth

33
00:05:32,548 --> 00:05:34,128
several meals for crafters.

34
00:05:34,588 --> 00:05:35,628
Then please take it back.

35
00:05:35,718 --> 00:05:38,218
Nonsense. It suits you.

36
00:05:42,018 --> 00:05:44,688
<i>Pungmulnori</i> is being enjoyed
at the marketplace.

37
00:05:44,768 --> 00:05:47,398
We will miss it if we do not hurry.

38
00:05:48,228 --> 00:05:49,688
You will not believe how fun it is--

39
00:05:52,988 --> 00:05:54,528
My lady, what is it?

40
00:05:54,608 --> 00:05:56,108
It is an item I value.

41
00:05:57,158 --> 00:05:58,368
Allow me, then.

42
00:05:58,698 --> 00:06:00,578
No, my lord. How about this?

43
00:06:00,658 --> 00:06:02,618
Can you hold my hand instead?

44
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:14,218
Can you extend your arm a little more?

45
00:06:14,298 --> 00:06:15,218
Do you have it?

46
00:06:16,548 --> 00:06:17,798
No, not yet.

47
00:06:18,548 --> 00:06:20,388
Why are you so adamant about retrieving--

48
00:06:20,468 --> 00:06:23,058
Less talking, more extending, please.

49
00:06:23,138 --> 00:06:24,098
All right.

50
00:06:30,228 --> 00:06:31,268
Got it.

51
00:06:35,318 --> 00:06:36,488
What a relief.

52
00:06:37,528 --> 00:06:38,988
Is that so precious?

53
00:06:45,078 --> 00:06:46,328
My lord,

54
00:06:48,578 --> 00:06:50,578
I believe I have not yet
given you a fan before.

55
00:07:08,438 --> 00:07:10,558
Do you not like it?

56
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:12,898
I am not as crafty yet.

57
00:07:14,898 --> 00:07:16,438
It is lovely.

58
00:07:22,278 --> 00:07:24,328
I also included a poem.

59
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:37,208
"The love child between bamboo and paper.

60
00:07:44,888 --> 00:07:46,848
It is the clear wind."

61
00:07:51,728 --> 00:07:54,648
It is one of the old poems
that stood out to me.

62
00:07:59,398 --> 00:08:00,488
Will you…

63
00:08:02,488 --> 00:08:03,988
accept this?

64
00:08:22,638 --> 00:08:23,638
My lady,

65
00:08:24,138 --> 00:08:25,678
we should call it a night.

66
00:08:26,348 --> 00:08:28,518
Sorry? But…

67
00:08:39,358 --> 00:08:40,398
Show yourself.

68
00:08:42,068 --> 00:08:43,198
This instant.

69
00:08:47,738 --> 00:08:48,908
Were you after me…

70
00:08:49,498 --> 00:08:51,038
or the lady?

71
00:08:54,918 --> 00:08:57,088
My lord, what is this about?

72
00:09:00,588 --> 00:09:02,418
Ttonggeum, Hyang.

73
00:09:05,008 --> 00:09:06,798
-Ttonggeum, Hyang?
-Miss!

74
00:09:06,888 --> 00:09:09,598
-What are you two doing here?
-You stay put

75
00:09:09,678 --> 00:09:12,638
while I ask this nobleman a few questions.

76
00:09:12,728 --> 00:09:13,728
-What?
-Wait.

77
00:09:16,608 --> 00:09:20,068
-His skin is not the fairest.
-And he is not so tall.

78
00:09:20,148 --> 00:09:21,608
He does not leave a good impression.

79
00:09:21,688 --> 00:09:23,238
I bet he has a nasty personality.

80
00:09:23,318 --> 00:09:26,698
What are your intentions with Miss?

81
00:09:26,778 --> 00:09:28,698
Just how much do you fancy her?

82
00:09:28,778 --> 00:09:31,998
Does your heart pound
at the thought of her?

83
00:09:32,078 --> 00:09:33,828
If you bring her any suffering--

84
00:09:33,908 --> 00:09:37,378
They were curious as to who I was meeting.

85
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:39,168
That is enough.

86
00:09:42,008 --> 00:09:43,668
An answer would still be nice--

87
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:46,968
Maybe we took it too far.

88
00:09:47,048 --> 00:09:48,678
He could cut glass with his glare.

89
00:09:49,558 --> 00:09:52,428
-I do not think he is the one for you.
-Of course he is.

90
00:09:54,768 --> 00:09:55,848
My lord.

91
00:09:57,898 --> 00:10:01,528
They only acted out of concern for me,
so I hope you understand.

92
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:06,408
They show concern in a rude way.

93
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:08,488
They're eavesdropping again.

94
00:10:09,488 --> 00:10:11,368
I understand that you saved them,

95
00:10:11,448 --> 00:10:13,158
but you do not want to be caught…

96
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,328
in danger again.

97
00:10:16,918 --> 00:10:19,168
I owe my life to you, my lord.

98
00:10:19,918 --> 00:10:22,378
It is why I will live a life
that has you proud of me.

99
00:10:31,008 --> 00:10:33,768
I will see you again on the next 15th.

100
00:10:52,198 --> 00:10:53,908
Hyang, let's have honey rice cakes.

101
00:10:54,498 --> 00:10:56,328
-Right.
-Have Ttonggeum's too.

102
00:10:56,408 --> 00:10:57,578
Yes, Miss.

103
00:10:58,578 --> 00:11:01,748
But we should find out where he lives!

104
00:11:02,338 --> 00:11:05,258
"My lord, I fancy you.

105
00:11:07,048 --> 00:11:08,468
Please marry me."

106
00:11:10,638 --> 00:11:12,758
Only that way will he understand.

107
00:11:12,848 --> 00:11:16,428
No man in this world
would see a fan as a sign of affection.

108
00:11:16,888 --> 00:11:18,058
She is done for.

109
00:11:18,138 --> 00:11:20,898
I bet she will die a virgin.

110
00:11:20,978 --> 00:11:21,978
No way.

111
00:11:25,688 --> 00:11:26,778
But Miss,

112
00:11:27,358 --> 00:11:30,988
the scholar seemed brusque and scary.

113
00:11:31,068 --> 00:11:33,028
Do you really like a man like him?

114
00:11:33,528 --> 00:11:36,328
You said he wouldn't tell you
where he lives and what he does.

115
00:11:37,828 --> 00:11:39,328
He must know how you feel about him

116
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:42,168
which makes me angry
that he has not mentioned marriage.

117
00:11:43,418 --> 00:11:45,128
He lives an unstable life being hunted.

118
00:11:46,168 --> 00:11:48,548
I doubt marriage is on his mind right now.

119
00:11:48,628 --> 00:11:51,088
Exactly. Why is he being hunted?

120
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:53,348
-What crime did he commit?
-Exactly.

121
00:11:54,348 --> 00:11:56,008
-Hyang.
-Yes, Miss?

122
00:11:56,098 --> 00:11:58,098
Did you look into the guest
at Left State Councilor's home?

123
00:11:58,678 --> 00:12:02,398
No one is allowed in the vicinity.
It must be someone important.

124
00:12:03,648 --> 00:12:05,068
Let me know what you find out.

125
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:07,858
Ttonggeum, how are things
at the Minister of War's?

126
00:12:07,938 --> 00:12:10,108
Every year, the family buys
three to four bamboo boxes.

127
00:12:10,198 --> 00:12:11,528
May I pay a visit sometime?

128
00:12:11,608 --> 00:12:13,408
I have already put in a good word.

129
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:17,038
Lady Yeonhee has been causing trouble,

130
00:12:17,288 --> 00:12:19,328
so they may not be in a state
to buy more boxes.

131
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:21,618
What kind of trouble?

132
00:12:31,088 --> 00:12:32,258
Eunuch Heo,

133
00:12:32,338 --> 00:12:35,548
I have been appointed
to serve at the King's Palace.

134
00:12:35,638 --> 00:12:39,098
Your great service at that Queen's Palace

135
00:12:39,678 --> 00:12:41,768
should be rewarded.

136
00:12:41,848 --> 00:12:43,808
I eagerly await your guidance.

137
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:54,618
Does His Majesty
still sleep in the library?

138
00:12:54,698 --> 00:12:57,778
Yes, Councilor Park.
He suffers from severe insomnia.

139
00:12:57,868 --> 00:13:00,998
The royal physician suggested
that he sleeps

140
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:03,208
wherever he feels like he can rest.

141
00:13:03,828 --> 00:13:06,628
Be aware of his thoughts
and serve him well.

142
00:13:07,918 --> 00:13:13,258
Never should there be a moment
where you lose track of him.

143
00:13:30,358 --> 00:13:32,148
<i>Before the marriage ban,</i>

144
00:13:33,028 --> 00:13:36,448
<i>the Queen Dowager and Left State Councilor
will decide on the Queen.</i>

145
00:13:37,698 --> 00:13:39,078
<i>Which family…</i>

146
00:13:40,238 --> 00:13:42,038
<i>will they let in the Queen's Palace?</i>

147
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,508
<i>Left State Councilor
would like an audience.</i>

148
00:14:06,518 --> 00:14:07,648
Please sit up.

149
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:13,688
You are scaring me.

150
00:14:15,238 --> 00:14:17,658
What grave matter are you here to address?

151
00:14:25,538 --> 00:14:29,998
I request that you entrust me
on the matter at hand.

152
00:14:32,128 --> 00:14:35,548
These are words of great loyalty.

153
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,388
You disgust me.

154
00:14:40,718 --> 00:14:41,718
Your Highness.

155
00:14:45,098 --> 00:14:46,638
I only need to know one thing.

156
00:14:48,558 --> 00:14:49,768
What…

157
00:14:50,478 --> 00:14:52,438
shall I do for you?

158
00:14:59,408 --> 00:15:01,068
Bring Yeonhee to me!

159
00:15:01,578 --> 00:15:03,408
Before the marriage ban is in place,

160
00:15:03,488 --> 00:15:04,998
you must hurry and wed.

161
00:15:05,748 --> 00:15:07,618
Why are you wasting your time?

162
00:15:08,248 --> 00:15:10,828
-I will not marry.
-Why not?

163
00:15:15,508 --> 00:15:17,718
You will be marrying
the Left State Councilor's nephew.

164
00:15:17,798 --> 00:15:19,428
He will soon be given a position in court.

165
00:15:20,258 --> 00:15:21,798
Once marriage is banned,

166
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:25,138
will I be included
in the selection for the Queen?

167
00:15:26,928 --> 00:15:30,188
Do not worry
for I will see to it that you are not.

168
00:15:31,148 --> 00:15:32,228
Yeonhee.

169
00:15:32,858 --> 00:15:34,188
I understand your troubles,

170
00:15:34,728 --> 00:15:36,898
but you cannot live forever under my care.

171
00:15:36,988 --> 00:15:40,028
And I would never marry you off to
a family that will give you a hard time.

172
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:43,908
I do not want this, so do not force me!

173
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:46,748
Why that…

174
00:15:47,038 --> 00:15:49,748
You as her nanny
should have done a better job.

175
00:15:49,828 --> 00:15:51,288
How did she grow up so arrogant?

176
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:54,958
I blame you for coddling her
after her mother passed away.

177
00:15:57,548 --> 00:15:59,128
-Do not just stand there.
-Sorry?

178
00:15:59,218 --> 00:16:01,678
Go and comfort her this instant.

179
00:16:02,138 --> 00:16:03,548
You of all people know

180
00:16:03,928 --> 00:16:06,218
that she will cry for days
and fall ill afterward.

181
00:16:06,308 --> 00:16:07,428
Yes, my lord.

182
00:16:07,808 --> 00:16:10,058
This will probably bring on
another hunger strike,

183
00:16:10,308 --> 00:16:12,098
so have her eat some <i>tarak-juk</i> at least.

184
00:16:13,058 --> 00:16:14,148
Do you hear me?

185
00:16:28,408 --> 00:16:31,788
So the Minister of War's daughter
is still holding out on marriage?

186
00:16:31,868 --> 00:16:35,418
Yes. She keeps telling her father
that she would hang herself

187
00:16:35,498 --> 00:16:36,798
rather than marry someone.

188
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:39,878
It must be true
that she is the apple of his eye.

189
00:16:40,418 --> 00:16:42,508
Why is she against marriage so much?

190
00:16:51,888 --> 00:16:54,018
You have delicate hands
for someone of low birth

191
00:16:54,978 --> 00:16:56,358
and are quite crafty.

192
00:16:56,438 --> 00:16:57,728
Thank you, my lady.

193
00:16:58,438 --> 00:17:00,068
The crafter is here with me,

194
00:17:00,148 --> 00:17:02,608
so it can be altered any way you please.

195
00:17:04,568 --> 00:17:05,618
Would you perhaps

196
00:17:06,278 --> 00:17:09,118
like a viewing of the wedding boxes?

197
00:17:10,248 --> 00:17:11,328
Wedding boxes?

198
00:17:11,408 --> 00:17:15,538
Yes, silk is wrapped around the corners
making them presentable and eye-catching.

199
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:19,418
A lot of good that will do.

200
00:17:23,048 --> 00:17:24,298
You need not bring them.

201
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:32,888
She must be refusing to marry
because she harbors feelings for another.

202
00:17:32,978 --> 00:17:34,638
-Really?
-Yeah.

203
00:17:35,518 --> 00:17:37,518
It's probably someone
she cannot marry easily.

204
00:17:38,398 --> 00:17:39,608
Can you look into it?

205
00:17:39,688 --> 00:17:42,568
Whatever you need, I will do.

206
00:17:42,648 --> 00:17:45,028
Tread lightly though.
You do not want to be scolded.

207
00:17:45,278 --> 00:17:48,488
Those who would scold me
hardly take interest in us slaves anyway.

208
00:17:48,578 --> 00:17:51,038
I can get around like nobody's business.

209
00:17:54,618 --> 00:17:55,578
Look who it is.

210
00:17:55,668 --> 00:17:58,378
I see you came all the way to Hanyang

211
00:17:58,588 --> 00:18:00,048
to do business like a commoner.

212
00:18:00,128 --> 00:18:03,218
We are here to sell our goods,
but you must be here to purchase one.

213
00:18:03,298 --> 00:18:05,298
Why you…

214
00:18:08,848 --> 00:18:12,058
Fancy that.
I see that you are here as well.

215
00:18:12,138 --> 00:18:14,308
I hope you are the last of you lot.

216
00:18:14,388 --> 00:18:16,728
The Minister of War
can shoot even a flying bird.

217
00:18:17,348 --> 00:18:19,518
Causing a ruckus
will benefit neither of us.

218
00:18:22,898 --> 00:18:23,898
Shall we?

219
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:30,618
Damn that broad.

220
00:18:37,668 --> 00:18:38,828
Hold on a second.

221
00:18:42,338 --> 00:18:46,298
Every time she visits Hanyang,
she is said to make a fortune.

222
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:51,808
No one in Joseon
makes boxes quite like she does.

223
00:18:52,718 --> 00:18:57,058
You should also marry soon
and fill these up with all kinds of good.

224
00:18:58,188 --> 00:19:01,188
Goodness. Look how pretty this is.

225
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:20,328
Identify yourself!

226
00:19:24,088 --> 00:19:25,418
My goodness!

227
00:19:27,508 --> 00:19:28,878
Stay inside, my lady.

228
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:30,798
You must not leave the litter.

229
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:40,978
Nanny?

230
00:19:42,728 --> 00:19:45,358
Have the rogues all been dealt with?

231
00:19:48,738 --> 00:19:49,898
Nanny?

232
00:19:57,748 --> 00:19:59,248
They have all fled,

233
00:20:00,418 --> 00:20:01,708
so you may open the door.

234
00:20:45,498 --> 00:20:47,128
<i>Minister of War,</i>

235
00:20:48,508 --> 00:20:49,758
<i>Cho Wonpyo.</i>

236
00:21:01,388 --> 00:21:04,808
Your Majesty, the moon shines brightly
as it is the 15th.

237
00:21:05,478 --> 00:21:07,978
May I suggest a light stroll?

238
00:21:10,738 --> 00:21:12,278
Is it already the 15th?

239
00:22:00,238 --> 00:22:02,158
I thought you were off
to a courtesan house today.

240
00:22:02,748 --> 00:22:03,748
That I was.

241
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:06,118
Today is the 15th.

242
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,958
It is. I will not be gone long.

243
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:10,548
There is no need.

244
00:22:11,838 --> 00:22:14,548
-Sorry?
-I have already sent Ma out

245
00:22:14,628 --> 00:22:17,008
to say that you will not make it today.

246
00:22:19,388 --> 00:22:20,428
But Master!

247
00:22:33,818 --> 00:22:35,948
Why won't you let me meet the scholar?

248
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:38,868
You don't know who he is.

249
00:22:39,448 --> 00:22:41,618
It cannot be said
that you know him either.

250
00:22:41,698 --> 00:22:43,498
He is on the run
after his family perished.

251
00:22:44,078 --> 00:22:45,868
I've told you, you'll fall in danger
if you get closer to him.

252
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:49,498
And I already said that I do not care.

253
00:22:51,088 --> 00:22:53,208
Please trust the man I have chosen.

254
00:22:53,298 --> 00:22:54,918
Whoever he may be,

255
00:22:56,128 --> 00:22:57,928
my feelings for him will stay the same.

256
00:23:00,718 --> 00:23:01,718
Jung!

257
00:23:11,018 --> 00:23:12,148
We will head out as well.

258
00:23:12,228 --> 00:23:13,228
But…

259
00:23:14,028 --> 00:23:16,858
what if he still awaits Lady Jung?

260
00:23:21,158 --> 00:23:23,538
He is not one to await anyone.

261
00:23:25,698 --> 00:23:27,408
Waiting will only be
her heartache to bear.

262
00:24:18,048 --> 00:24:19,838
I thought you had left.

263
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:21,468
And I thought you were not coming.

264
00:24:24,138 --> 00:24:27,808
Then, why did you wait for me?

265
00:24:29,058 --> 00:24:30,138
Just in case…

266
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:34,148
you actually showed up.

267
00:24:50,248 --> 00:24:53,288
A late-night snack was not requested,
so why cause a ruckus?

268
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:55,418
It is bad enough
that His Majesty is a light sleeper.

269
00:24:55,498 --> 00:24:57,548
My apologies!

270
00:24:58,128 --> 00:24:59,508
Lower your voice.

271
00:25:04,508 --> 00:25:07,348
Your Majesty, it is of no concern.

272
00:25:07,428 --> 00:25:08,928
Please head back to sleep.

273
00:25:26,068 --> 00:25:29,868
Your Majesty,
did the commotion startle you?

274
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:34,538
Your Majesty,

275
00:25:35,878 --> 00:25:38,288
forgive the intrusion.

276
00:26:08,618 --> 00:26:11,078
His Majesty ordered not to be disturbed.

277
00:26:11,658 --> 00:26:13,368
How is it that you were inside?

278
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:16,868
I was asked to help him read
before he succumbed to sleep.

279
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:27,948
Don't make that face.

280
00:27:30,278 --> 00:27:33,698
Smile like you were doing before. Smile.

281
00:28:54,028 --> 00:28:55,658
I guess it is time for you to leave.

282
00:28:58,908 --> 00:29:01,328
Miss! Miss, is that you?

283
00:29:09,508 --> 00:29:10,838
I will get going.

284
00:29:11,878 --> 00:29:15,008
Of course.
Until the 15th next month, then.

285
00:29:19,598 --> 00:29:20,928
Here you go.

286
00:29:27,318 --> 00:29:28,858
Miss!

287
00:29:28,938 --> 00:29:31,568
Wait, you again?

288
00:29:33,528 --> 00:29:35,568
Why does he flee whenever he sees us?

289
00:29:35,658 --> 00:29:37,408
Is he really a wanted man?

290
00:29:37,488 --> 00:29:39,158
Tell me about it. Oh, Miss!

291
00:29:39,738 --> 00:29:42,458
I finally found out who resides
at the Left State Councilor's annex.

292
00:29:42,538 --> 00:29:43,658
Who is it?

293
00:30:52,688 --> 00:30:55,068
-Cheers.
-Are you drinking alone?

294
00:30:55,148 --> 00:30:57,568
-Goodness.
-Allow me to pour you a cup.

295
00:30:57,658 --> 00:30:59,068
Goodness me!

296
00:31:00,528 --> 00:31:02,788
-There you go.
-How nice.

297
00:31:10,418 --> 00:31:11,838
Bring it here.

298
00:31:43,238 --> 00:31:45,288
Do you remember this sword?

299
00:31:51,328 --> 00:31:52,328
My lord.

300
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:55,378
You have not left yet.

301
00:31:58,668 --> 00:32:00,718
Why are you looking into
the Left State Councilor's affairs?

302
00:32:04,468 --> 00:32:07,058
I received information that intrigued me.

303
00:32:07,138 --> 00:32:08,478
What kind of information?

304
00:32:09,598 --> 00:32:12,438
A woman currently resides
in the Left State Councilor's annex.

305
00:32:14,518 --> 00:32:16,568
She is his niece.

306
00:32:20,318 --> 00:32:21,608
This sword…

307
00:32:22,658 --> 00:32:24,908
led us through the gates

308
00:32:25,578 --> 00:32:27,748
on the day we deposed the King.

309
00:32:28,538 --> 00:32:31,458
Remember how many men
were sacrificed that day.

310
00:32:31,538 --> 00:32:33,708
The blood shed by those loyal subjects…

311
00:32:35,628 --> 00:32:37,088
protected this nation.

312
00:32:37,668 --> 00:32:40,088
What am I about to suggest

313
00:32:41,218 --> 00:32:42,968
is not out of greed.

314
00:32:43,048 --> 00:32:46,258
It is the same as when
I led you that day wielding this sword.

315
00:32:46,348 --> 00:32:48,388
This is me pleading.

316
00:32:53,598 --> 00:32:55,018
I'm going

317
00:32:56,358 --> 00:32:58,778
to select my niece as the Queen.

318
00:32:59,488 --> 00:33:00,858
The Left State Councilor's…

319
00:33:03,108 --> 00:33:04,618
-niece?
-Yes.

320
00:33:04,698 --> 00:33:07,328
Probably to crown her as queen.

321
00:33:07,408 --> 00:33:11,158
She is kept hidden from most people
while being taught royal etiquette.

322
00:33:11,868 --> 00:33:14,208
Marriage falls under the jurisdiction
of the Queen Dowager.

323
00:33:14,288 --> 00:33:16,588
Her Highness colluding
with the Left State Councilor

324
00:33:16,668 --> 00:33:19,338
can lead to anyone
being selected as queen.

325
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:22,218
Why is it…

326
00:33:23,338 --> 00:33:25,638
that you are looking into this matter?

327
00:33:26,548 --> 00:33:29,178
Is it to get revenge
on the most powerful man in Joseon?

328
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:36,148
If it were possible,

329
00:33:36,978 --> 00:33:38,518
nothing would stop me.

330
00:33:39,648 --> 00:33:42,318
Hundreds of scholars
were framed for treason

331
00:33:42,648 --> 00:33:44,908
and dozens of bloodlines perished.

332
00:33:44,988 --> 00:33:48,988
Countless innocents died
without knowing why.

333
00:33:50,448 --> 00:33:52,958
Someone destroyed my family and yours,

334
00:33:53,538 --> 00:33:56,328
but we have yet to uncover
who orchestrated it.

335
00:33:57,498 --> 00:34:00,458
We must first find out
who murdered the late Queen Inyoung.

336
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:04,088
I will figure it out.

337
00:34:04,678 --> 00:34:06,758
I will bring him to justice so that…

338
00:34:08,758 --> 00:34:13,428
my father is no longer known
as the late Queen's murderer.

339
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:18,358
For my sake…

340
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:21,318
and for yours--

341
00:34:21,398 --> 00:34:24,778
For my sake? Then, you are to do nothing.

342
00:34:25,948 --> 00:34:27,488
If you want what is best for me,

343
00:34:28,528 --> 00:34:30,078
you will forget what happened

344
00:34:31,238 --> 00:34:32,948
and live a normal life.

345
00:34:44,468 --> 00:34:45,838
Our blood

346
00:34:46,678 --> 00:34:49,718
put an end to the tyranny
of the King we deposed.

347
00:34:49,798 --> 00:34:51,508
But what about the generations to come?

348
00:34:53,178 --> 00:34:56,978
Who can guarantee that
this nation will not see another tyrant?

349
00:34:57,058 --> 00:34:59,938
I do not see how this ties in
with the selection of the Queen.

350
00:35:00,018 --> 00:35:04,108
It is why we must control
the Queen's Palace.

351
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:08,698
What we need is a system
that will prevent tyrants from being born.

352
00:35:08,778 --> 00:35:11,778
That is the time we need!

353
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:33,258
For us to mold a wise leader
out of the future Crown Prince.

354
00:35:36,928 --> 00:35:39,058
That is the time we need.

355
00:35:47,318 --> 00:35:51,818
The ignorant people of this nation
will see it as your selfish desires.

356
00:35:51,908 --> 00:35:54,738
How will you handle the reproach
from the royal family and the Sarim?

357
00:35:54,828 --> 00:35:57,078
It could end up backfiring on us.

358
00:36:02,998 --> 00:36:05,918
Show respect.
The Queen Dowager has entered.

359
00:36:10,178 --> 00:36:12,718
Your Highness,
what brings you to a residential area?

360
00:36:13,298 --> 00:36:16,598
I wish to speak
regarding the King's matrimony.

361
00:36:24,018 --> 00:36:27,478
Left State Councilor's words are mine,
and my words…

362
00:36:28,438 --> 00:36:30,568
are the King's.

363
00:36:43,498 --> 00:36:46,878
I will heed your command.

364
00:36:46,958 --> 00:36:52,048
-I will heed your command.
-I will heed your command.

365
00:37:30,128 --> 00:37:31,628
I need to…

366
00:37:36,508 --> 00:37:38,388
I mean… Come on.

367
00:37:41,138 --> 00:37:42,018
What gives?

368
00:37:42,098 --> 00:37:44,558
I hear you do anything for money.

369
00:37:46,648 --> 00:37:49,528
And I come bearing information
which will give you just that.

370
00:37:54,528 --> 00:37:56,618
It is exactly as I say it is.

371
00:37:56,868 --> 00:38:00,538
She always leaves her residence
to meet a man on the 15th.

372
00:38:01,038 --> 00:38:04,958
And the money she earned from sales
is stacked at her house.

373
00:38:05,038 --> 00:38:08,998
All we need to do is abduct her
and squeeze her for the money!

374
00:38:09,088 --> 00:38:12,798
Now, please dig in. Have your fill!

375
00:38:12,878 --> 00:38:14,758
What a good day this is.

376
00:38:14,838 --> 00:38:17,388
Those riffraffs seem
to be plotting something.

377
00:38:17,468 --> 00:38:20,008
-Have them reported.
-Yes, my lord.

378
00:39:01,008 --> 00:39:02,718
What is it that I did wrong?

379
00:39:03,098 --> 00:39:05,308
It is the Left State Councilor
who covets the Queen's Palace.

380
00:39:05,638 --> 00:39:08,268
The Queen Dowager siding with him

381
00:39:08,688 --> 00:39:11,188
does not mean
you should drop your objections.

382
00:39:11,478 --> 00:39:12,568
Look here.

383
00:39:13,108 --> 00:39:16,778
Have you forgotten that a royal marriage
falls under the jurisdiction of the elder?

384
00:39:16,858 --> 00:39:19,198
A royal marriage
shapes the future of Joseon.

385
00:39:19,278 --> 00:39:21,448
She cannot be allowed
to make a unilateral decision.

386
00:39:22,278 --> 00:39:25,248
It is for this reason that she is
the subject of a scandalous rumor!

387
00:39:25,328 --> 00:39:26,538
How dare you!

388
00:39:31,588 --> 00:39:36,128
For speaking disgracefully
of the great Queen Dowager,

389
00:39:36,718 --> 00:39:39,888
you will be sentenced
to forfeit all your dirty assets.

390
00:39:41,348 --> 00:39:42,468
Prattle once more

391
00:39:42,888 --> 00:39:47,138
and your family will pay the price
with their lives.

392
00:39:47,768 --> 00:39:49,228
Prattle once again

393
00:39:49,848 --> 00:39:54,188
and I will rip off your limbs,

394
00:39:55,478 --> 00:39:59,448
each and every one,
while you watch in pain.

395
00:40:01,158 --> 00:40:03,528
Every asset he has harbored

396
00:40:03,618 --> 00:40:05,328
will be returned to the nation.

397
00:40:06,248 --> 00:40:07,658
I will directly oversee

398
00:40:08,618 --> 00:40:09,748
the operation.

399
00:40:16,668 --> 00:40:17,918
How odd.

400
00:40:18,298 --> 00:40:20,678
It is not like Councilor Park
to disobey Confucian ethics.

401
00:40:22,718 --> 00:40:24,178
What did the internal prince do?

402
00:40:24,808 --> 00:40:25,968
Well…

403
00:40:27,428 --> 00:40:28,348
Tell me.

404
00:40:28,428 --> 00:40:32,188
He dared to speak ill of you,
Your Highness.

405
00:40:41,658 --> 00:40:44,408
The hideous last efforts of a man
who has met his downfall.

406
00:40:45,488 --> 00:40:46,488
Court Lady Han,

407
00:40:46,578 --> 00:40:49,748
have all the daughters of those in office
gather at the palace tomorrow.

408
00:40:50,368 --> 00:40:51,748
Yes, Your Highness.

409
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:03,178
<i>Were you injured?</i>

410
00:41:03,758 --> 00:41:05,758
If you tell me who you are,

411
00:41:06,968 --> 00:41:09,848
my father will reward you greatly.

412
00:41:10,848 --> 00:41:13,728
That will not be necessary
since I was already rewarded.

413
00:41:18,478 --> 00:41:21,028
I came by to enjoy
cherry blossoms in full bloom,

414
00:41:22,358 --> 00:41:24,318
but the real flower was here all along.

415
00:41:26,658 --> 00:41:28,038
How insolent.

416
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:30,198
Do you have any idea
who you are talking to?

417
00:41:30,288 --> 00:41:32,538
Do you know who I am to be so audacious?

418
00:41:34,368 --> 00:41:37,288
Who… exactly may you be?

419
00:41:42,758 --> 00:41:43,968
Those beads!

420
00:41:44,968 --> 00:41:47,218
They were a gift to His Majesty
by my father.

421
00:41:47,848 --> 00:41:50,768
How is it that you have those?

422
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:52,428
The Minister of War presented them

423
00:41:52,518 --> 00:41:55,058
proudly speaking of
how his daughter picked them out.

424
00:41:55,148 --> 00:41:56,268
That must make you…

425
00:41:57,398 --> 00:41:58,938
the Minister of War's daughter.

426
00:42:00,068 --> 00:42:02,648
Your… Majesty?

427
00:42:03,568 --> 00:42:05,448
I wish to keep my outing secret,

428
00:42:05,858 --> 00:42:09,278
so please let our encounter
stay between us.

429
00:42:10,538 --> 00:42:11,868
Will you promise me that?

430
00:42:26,218 --> 00:42:28,758
Today's gathering
concerns the royal marriage.

431
00:42:29,348 --> 00:42:31,768
Are we here for
the Queen Dowager to inspect?

432
00:42:35,518 --> 00:42:37,558
The Queen Dowager shall enter.

433
00:42:53,658 --> 00:42:55,998
I see we have an empty seat.

434
00:42:56,248 --> 00:42:58,788
The Left State Councilor's niece
has a cold

435
00:42:58,878 --> 00:43:02,298
and was deeply ashamed
of not being present today.

436
00:43:02,878 --> 00:43:04,798
Have the royal physician
attend to her illness.

437
00:43:05,378 --> 00:43:08,048
Then, allow me to clear her seat.

438
00:43:08,638 --> 00:43:09,588
Leave it.

439
00:43:11,848 --> 00:43:13,928
It is the one reserved
for who will rise in power.

440
00:43:15,728 --> 00:43:18,018
Though her seat is empty,
show respect to the lady.

441
00:43:19,728 --> 00:43:21,688
She is who you will serve.

442
00:43:23,978 --> 00:43:25,818
-Yes, Your Highness.
-Yes, Your Highness.

443
00:43:34,868 --> 00:43:36,868
Did something upset you at the palace?

444
00:43:36,958 --> 00:43:39,828
The Left State Councilor.
How many nieces does he have?

445
00:43:39,918 --> 00:43:42,998
I bet she is some distant relative
from the countryside. As if that matters.

446
00:43:43,298 --> 00:43:46,798
Meanwhile, my family has seen
two ministers from my mother's side!

447
00:43:49,628 --> 00:43:53,428
When Father returns from work,
tell him that I will marry.

448
00:43:53,508 --> 00:43:54,598
Lady Yeonhee?

449
00:43:55,178 --> 00:43:57,268
I will marry someone…

450
00:43:58,308 --> 00:44:00,518
before the marriage ban is issued.

451
00:44:08,568 --> 00:44:10,658
The order stated all of his assets…

452
00:44:12,778 --> 00:44:15,328
including the pavilion bestowed upon him

453
00:44:15,698 --> 00:44:17,578
by His Majesty.

454
00:44:17,658 --> 00:44:19,998
The officers checked many times,

455
00:44:21,038 --> 00:44:23,958
but such a pavilion does not exist.

456
00:44:24,038 --> 00:44:25,298
It does not exist?

457
00:44:27,168 --> 00:44:29,298
But I specifically remember
Eunuch Jung reporting

458
00:44:29,378 --> 00:44:32,638
that two houses will be demolished
for the pavilion to be built.

459
00:44:33,048 --> 00:44:37,848
Maybe Eunuch Jung
was not speaking the truth.

460
00:44:40,768 --> 00:44:42,898
All eunuchs will exit their quarters!

461
00:44:42,978 --> 00:44:44,308
Room inspections!

462
00:44:48,398 --> 00:44:49,688
Get searching!

463
00:44:49,778 --> 00:44:50,818
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

464
00:45:17,428 --> 00:45:19,218
There was nothing out of the ordinary.

465
00:45:21,308 --> 00:45:22,388
All right.

466
00:45:50,338 --> 00:45:54,178
CLASSIC OF POETRY

467
00:46:03,808 --> 00:46:04,978
Why do you find

468
00:46:06,148 --> 00:46:07,898
this old book to be suspicious?

469
00:46:08,188 --> 00:46:10,568
It is the old book

470
00:46:10,648 --> 00:46:17,028
that His Majesty also kept close to him
in his library.

471
00:46:20,288 --> 00:46:21,828
<i>I wanted to console the internal prince</i>

472
00:46:21,908 --> 00:46:24,368
by demolishing a deserted house
and building a pavilion.

473
00:46:25,538 --> 00:46:26,748
How big is it?

474
00:46:27,418 --> 00:46:29,788
A house of 21 <i>kan</i> will be used
to build it with 4 <i>dan</i> and 4 <i>jum,</i>

475
00:46:29,878 --> 00:46:33,718
and a house of 22 <i>kan</i> will become
3 <i>dan</i> and 9 <i>jum.</i>

476
00:46:33,798 --> 00:46:35,008
Come to think of it,

477
00:46:36,048 --> 00:46:37,388
I did find it odd

478
00:46:37,468 --> 00:46:40,928
that he reported even the smallest
of measurements to His Majesty.

479
00:46:42,638 --> 00:46:46,808
Was there really a need
to be that precise?

480
00:47:05,658 --> 00:47:08,378
<i>A house of 21 </i>kan<i> will be used</i>
<i>to build it with 4</i> dan <i>and 4</i> jum…

481
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:09,628
DEATH

482
00:47:16,548 --> 00:47:20,178
<i>…and a house of 22</i> kan<i> will become</i>
<i>3</i> dan <i>and 9</i> jum.

483
00:47:22,058 --> 00:47:24,808
QUEEN

484
00:47:28,848 --> 00:47:30,268
<i>That day, it was not me</i>

485
00:47:31,728 --> 00:47:33,898
<i>who Jung Euikyun came to see.</i>

486
00:47:35,238 --> 00:47:40,238
<i>It was to report to His Majesty
that the Queen was dying.</i>

487
00:47:53,168 --> 00:47:54,708
<i>It is as you said.</i>

488
00:47:54,798 --> 00:47:57,378
Councilor Park's niece
will be selected as the Queen.

489
00:47:59,178 --> 00:48:00,638
What the skies and earth may know

490
00:48:03,098 --> 00:48:05,808
have yet to reach the ears of the King.

491
00:48:07,848 --> 00:48:09,478
The Left State Councilor has the power…

492
00:48:12,648 --> 00:48:14,898
to even keep the world from talking.

493
00:48:15,938 --> 00:48:18,358
With the Queen and the Crown Prince
on his side,

494
00:48:19,648 --> 00:48:23,578
his family will be in power
for generations to come.

495
00:48:24,158 --> 00:48:24,988
Your Majesty,

496
00:48:25,078 --> 00:48:27,998
order me to bring you his head

497
00:48:28,408 --> 00:48:31,328
and that is what I will do.

498
00:48:32,578 --> 00:48:35,048
Beheading him
will not bring this to an end.

499
00:48:35,628 --> 00:48:38,418
All meritorious subjects
must be brought down as well.

500
00:48:41,468 --> 00:48:42,838
Prepare for my secret outing.

501
00:48:43,928 --> 00:48:47,138
Have the cavalry guards join me!

502
00:48:47,218 --> 00:48:48,178
But Your Majesty…

503
00:48:48,268 --> 00:48:50,098
This is the beginning.

504
00:48:53,348 --> 00:48:54,608
I cannot let…

505
00:48:56,478 --> 00:48:58,858
the niece of Councilor Park
become the Queen.

506
00:49:22,468 --> 00:49:24,638
You summoned me, my lord.

507
00:49:26,178 --> 00:49:27,928
Is Yeonhee involved with a man?

508
00:49:28,468 --> 00:49:30,728
That is preposterous, my lord!

509
00:49:35,188 --> 00:49:36,858
Then explain this letter.

510
00:49:37,068 --> 00:49:39,148
It… only speaks of lies.

511
00:49:40,688 --> 00:49:42,358
Will you bet your life on it?

512
00:49:45,238 --> 00:49:46,738
Keep an eye on Yeonhee

513
00:49:47,738 --> 00:49:50,448
and report back to me
if any man lurks around her.

514
00:49:50,538 --> 00:49:53,618
If you dare collude with her to fool me,

515
00:49:57,628 --> 00:49:59,708
I will cut off your head myself.

516
00:50:01,548 --> 00:50:02,758
What is this?

517
00:50:03,168 --> 00:50:07,388
Some scholar asked
that I give this to you.

518
00:50:15,018 --> 00:50:17,188
Lady Yeonhee
just left through the back door.

519
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:11,198
I announce my presence to His Majesty.

520
00:51:36,388 --> 00:51:38,438
Submit yourself as a candidate
in the Queen selection.

521
00:51:39,018 --> 00:51:40,688
It will do no good.

522
00:51:42,068 --> 00:51:44,608
The whole world knows that
the Left State Councilor's niece

523
00:51:44,688 --> 00:51:46,068
is set to wed the King.

524
00:51:46,608 --> 00:51:47,948
During the three-stage process,

525
00:51:49,158 --> 00:51:51,408
I may choose the family
from which my queen is from.

526
00:51:56,158 --> 00:51:57,248
I…

527
00:51:58,208 --> 00:51:59,708
do not follow.

528
00:52:00,288 --> 00:52:02,288
Is there a particular family…

529
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:05,628
you have in mind?

530
00:52:06,298 --> 00:52:07,468
There is.

531
00:52:08,878 --> 00:52:09,968
You are…

532
00:52:11,468 --> 00:52:13,008
who I want.

533
00:52:23,358 --> 00:52:24,438
Halt!

534
00:52:33,738 --> 00:52:35,448
Capture all the men you see.

535
00:52:36,158 --> 00:52:38,118
You may slay those who resist!

536
00:53:45,268 --> 00:53:46,308
Halt!

537
00:53:50,028 --> 00:53:51,318
Are you not the cavalry guards?

538
00:53:55,028 --> 00:53:56,988
Why are His Majesty's guards here?

539
00:54:19,258 --> 00:54:21,218
I, Minister of War, Cho Wonpyo,

540
00:54:21,968 --> 00:54:23,598
announce myself in His Majesty's presence.

541
00:54:46,748 --> 00:54:49,248
His Majesty has been gone for 30 minutes.

542
00:54:49,708 --> 00:54:53,458
The cavalry guards
accompanied him on his outing,

543
00:54:53,548 --> 00:54:57,008
so I will find out where he went
as soon as he returns.

544
00:54:58,048 --> 00:54:59,048
Or…

545
00:54:59,138 --> 00:55:03,098
should I have
Jung Euikyun brought in immediately?

546
00:55:04,308 --> 00:55:06,598
As if I care about some eunuch.

547
00:55:07,228 --> 00:55:08,808
It is His Majesty that matters.

548
00:55:09,438 --> 00:55:11,188
He has fallen through the cracks.

549
00:55:12,188 --> 00:55:13,898
There must be a reason

550
00:55:13,988 --> 00:55:17,108
why he has been collecting information
with a code he secretly invented.

551
00:55:18,488 --> 00:55:22,368
Where his head is at
and what he plans to do.

552
00:55:25,368 --> 00:55:26,708
That you must find out.

553
00:55:32,038 --> 00:55:35,758
I must say I am embarrassed
to have been caught by you.

554
00:55:37,008 --> 00:55:40,548
I am the one to blame
for not properly educating my daughter.

555
00:55:40,678 --> 00:55:42,218
Please let the affair be forgotten.

556
00:55:43,388 --> 00:55:45,928
I will silence all the men
that were present tonight.

557
00:55:46,478 --> 00:55:47,478
Of course.

558
00:55:49,938 --> 00:55:51,478
They may not listen to me,

559
00:55:53,478 --> 00:55:55,358
but they sure will listen to you.

560
00:55:58,948 --> 00:56:01,068
However, will you be able
to keep me silent as well?

561
00:56:04,198 --> 00:56:05,328
I…

562
00:56:06,248 --> 00:56:08,038
will make my way to the Queen Dowager…

563
00:56:09,168 --> 00:56:12,418
and announce that your daughter and I
have already embraced one another.

564
00:56:12,498 --> 00:56:13,668
Your Majesty!

565
00:56:14,878 --> 00:56:17,918
You will be condemning my daughter!

566
00:56:20,218 --> 00:56:21,388
How dare you.

567
00:56:23,848 --> 00:56:27,388
Is that how you view
the noble status of a queen?

568
00:56:39,608 --> 00:56:41,988
I am fully aware of how loyal

569
00:56:42,988 --> 00:56:44,698
you truly are.

570
00:56:45,698 --> 00:56:49,288
How clever and noble you are
stay undetected by our ignorant people

571
00:56:49,368 --> 00:56:51,998
as they continue to only see you
as Councilor Park's lackey.

572
00:56:53,628 --> 00:56:55,248
That is what saddens me.

573
00:57:02,468 --> 00:57:03,548
Minister Cho,

574
00:57:05,848 --> 00:57:07,718
be the grandfather of my eldest son.

575
00:57:13,478 --> 00:57:14,608
It is my wish

576
00:57:15,268 --> 00:57:18,528
to father a child with your daughter.

577
00:57:39,008 --> 00:57:41,838
All right. Are you ready to head out?

578
00:57:43,218 --> 00:57:44,218
Shall we?

579
00:57:48,848 --> 00:57:49,968
Off we go.

580
00:57:58,858 --> 00:57:59,858
Your Majesty,

581
00:58:01,028 --> 00:58:02,648
should I bring a fan in?

582
00:58:03,528 --> 00:58:04,528
There is no need.

583
00:58:05,868 --> 00:58:08,828
There were men by the crafter's shop
plotting an abduction.

584
00:58:10,158 --> 00:58:11,328
Did you report it?

585
00:58:11,408 --> 00:58:12,868
I did, but

586
00:58:14,118 --> 00:58:15,958
a punishment was not issued

587
00:58:16,708 --> 00:58:18,998
mainly because their target was unharmed.

588
00:58:21,168 --> 00:58:22,208
However,

589
00:58:23,838 --> 00:58:25,968
since this seems to involve Lady Yoo Jung,

590
00:58:26,428 --> 00:58:28,548
I advise you to no longer
be invested in the matter.

591
00:58:34,558 --> 00:58:37,438
-Why were they after her though?
-Your Majesty,

592
00:58:37,518 --> 00:58:40,108
it is time for your daily lessons.

593
00:58:58,498 --> 00:59:00,378
"Scholar officials manage the royal court

594
00:59:00,458 --> 00:59:03,048
and military officials
protect our borders."

595
00:59:03,458 --> 00:59:07,588
It is why one must be thorough
when appointing a general.

596
00:59:07,758 --> 00:59:11,218
Respectable councilors
will add weight to the royal court

597
00:59:11,718 --> 00:59:12,808
and that will in turn…

598
00:59:12,888 --> 00:59:16,848
And the money she earned from sales
is stacked at her house.

599
00:59:16,938 --> 00:59:20,518
All we need to do is abduct her
and squeeze her for the money!

600
00:59:22,938 --> 00:59:25,148
<i>Since this seems to involve Lady Yoo Jung,</i>

601
00:59:25,238 --> 00:59:27,778
<i>I advise you to no longer
be invested in the matter.</i>

602
00:59:30,528 --> 00:59:32,198
I am done with today's lessons.

603
00:59:33,698 --> 00:59:35,118
Bring me Eunuch Jung.

604
00:59:39,128 --> 00:59:40,328
Your Majesty.

605
00:59:40,418 --> 00:59:44,798
After finishing his daily duties,
Eunuch Jung left the palace on errands.

606
00:59:44,878 --> 00:59:47,258
Send someone.
Have him return to the palace at once.

607
00:59:47,508 --> 00:59:50,928
It will still take about an hour.

608
00:59:59,098 --> 01:00:00,018
Your Majesty,

609
01:00:00,098 --> 01:00:02,768
you do not seem at ease.

610
01:00:03,398 --> 01:00:05,688
May I suggest that you

611
01:00:06,108 --> 01:00:09,028
head to the library and take a short nap?

612
01:00:13,828 --> 01:00:14,908
Have it prepared.

613
01:00:15,948 --> 01:00:17,158
Yes, Your Majesty.

614
01:00:35,468 --> 01:00:37,018
<i>Someone with a eunuch's identity tag</i>

615
01:00:37,098 --> 01:00:38,428
<i>exited the palace.</i>

616
01:00:39,138 --> 01:00:42,648
<i>Many assume that it was His Majesty.</i>

617
01:03:01,618 --> 01:03:02,828
Hey!

618
01:03:02,908 --> 01:03:06,418
Hey, get up. Damn it!

619
01:03:06,498 --> 01:03:08,378
Get up, you. Darn it!

620
01:03:17,758 --> 01:03:20,298
-Who put you up to this?
-This?

621
01:03:20,718 --> 01:03:22,308
No one.

622
01:03:22,388 --> 01:03:26,018
Then, why are you after the lady?

623
01:03:26,098 --> 01:03:28,728
-Is it the money?
-Well, you see…

624
01:03:28,898 --> 01:03:30,768
As long as that greed exists,

625
01:03:32,688 --> 01:03:34,108
you will go after her again.

626
01:03:34,188 --> 01:03:35,858
Of course not.

627
01:03:35,948 --> 01:03:39,488
If you let me live, I will never again…

628
01:03:53,588 --> 01:03:54,628
My lord?

629
01:04:40,178 --> 01:04:43,968
What you saw and heard.
Tell me everything you know.

630
01:04:51,978 --> 01:04:54,228
You were almost injured.
How can you be this reckless?

631
01:04:55,818 --> 01:04:57,318
I am all right.

632
01:04:58,648 --> 01:05:00,148
What is going on though?

633
01:05:00,238 --> 01:05:01,528
Why was an arrow shot?

634
01:05:06,948 --> 01:05:08,158
It is nothing.

635
01:05:08,248 --> 01:05:10,578
How can it be nothing
when you are bleeding?

636
01:05:23,088 --> 01:05:24,508
Who did this?

637
01:05:25,098 --> 01:05:26,138
Why are you angry?

638
01:05:26,218 --> 01:05:28,058
How can I not be when you are hurt?

639
01:05:37,518 --> 01:05:39,648
I will not ask why you carry a sword

640
01:05:41,238 --> 01:05:43,818
or why I cannot see you daily.

641
01:05:44,778 --> 01:05:45,738
But,

642
01:05:46,448 --> 01:05:48,538
I am done seeing you hurt

643
01:05:49,748 --> 01:05:50,908
and in pain.

644
01:05:52,868 --> 01:05:53,748
That is why…

645
01:05:56,748 --> 01:05:58,248
I ask you to take me as your wife.

646
01:06:16,188 --> 01:06:18,318
There is a woman His Majesty sees…

647
01:06:19,528 --> 01:06:20,778
during…

648
01:06:21,858 --> 01:06:23,448
his secret outings?

649
01:06:27,568 --> 01:06:31,118
I wish to comfort you
from your unspoken hardships.

650
01:06:33,328 --> 01:06:34,458
My heart…

651
01:06:35,578 --> 01:06:36,918
beats for you.

652
01:06:51,808 --> 01:06:53,058
I am afraid…

653
01:06:57,058 --> 01:06:58,478
I already have…

654
01:07:01,188 --> 01:07:02,688
one to betroth.

655
01:07:26,548 --> 01:07:29,548
BLOODY HEART

656
01:07:50,528 --> 01:07:53,408
<i>I need… that woman.</i>

657
01:07:55,288 --> 01:07:56,498
Please take my hand.

658
01:07:57,078 --> 01:07:58,418
<i>That I cannot do.</i>

659
01:07:58,498 --> 01:08:01,458
<i>His Majesty harbors affection
for another young lady.</i>

660
01:08:01,538 --> 01:08:04,048
<i>Will she be an obstacle
in the royal marriage?</i>

661
01:08:04,128 --> 01:08:05,918
<i>What is it that I do not know?</i>

662
01:08:06,508 --> 01:08:09,298
The next time we meet,
I will tell you everything.

663
01:08:09,378 --> 01:08:11,348
<i>How will you handle the issue?</i>

664
01:08:11,428 --> 01:08:12,848
<i>It is a great opportunity.</i>

665
01:08:12,928 --> 01:08:15,388
<i>Why miss the chance to bring him pleasure?</i>

666
01:08:15,468 --> 01:08:19,308
<i>Despite the high status,
she will be despised.</i>

667
01:08:19,388 --> 01:08:21,768
<i>Challenge me with any woman you please.</i>

668
01:08:22,108 --> 01:08:24,108
