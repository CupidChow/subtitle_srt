1
00:00:42,258 --> 00:00:46,178
BLOODY HEART

2
00:00:46,258 --> 00:00:49,178
THE PEOPLE, GROUPS, PLACES, AND INCIDENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE PURELY FICTIONAL

3
00:00:59,568 --> 00:01:00,818
I have seen

4
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:03,698
this arrangement before.

5
00:01:09,158 --> 00:01:13,078
I saw it before you collapsed.

6
00:01:18,168 --> 00:01:21,128
The one who caused
the regency by the Queen Dowager,

7
00:01:22,168 --> 00:01:25,178
the one who shook this nation
and let it fall in danger was…

8
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:31,718
you…

9
00:01:34,058 --> 00:01:35,938
and your design?

10
00:02:14,178 --> 00:02:15,388
Yes,

11
00:02:18,978 --> 00:02:20,438
it was all my doing.

12
00:02:26,198 --> 00:02:28,108
It was an inevitable event.

13
00:02:29,118 --> 00:02:30,988
And it was to protect us both.

14
00:02:31,868 --> 00:02:33,698
But people died.

15
00:02:33,788 --> 00:02:35,708
They were unavoidable sacrifices.

16
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:37,708
Ttonggeum has died.

17
00:02:38,288 --> 00:02:40,918
She died because of your scheming.

18
00:02:40,998 --> 00:02:42,588
She died stripped…

19
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:46,468
of her dignity.

20
00:03:43,268 --> 00:03:45,818
BLOODY HEART
EPISODE 15

21
00:03:51,278 --> 00:03:52,318
<i>You know,</i>

22
00:03:53,238 --> 00:03:56,538
<i>I do not need to be born
as a noble in my next life.</i>

23
00:03:57,038 --> 00:04:00,578
<i>I would not mind being a servant
or livestock for that matter</i>

24
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,788
<i>as long as you are my master.</i>

25
00:04:03,288 --> 00:04:07,838
Living in your shadows
eating whatever you give me

26
00:04:08,588 --> 00:04:11,298
will be a satisfying life.

27
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:17,138
<i>A happy one too.</i>

28
00:04:37,448 --> 00:04:40,748
Put at least ten steps
between you and the chambers.

29
00:05:12,068 --> 00:05:13,198
Ttonggeum…

30
00:05:14,608 --> 00:05:16,568
only came to the palace to protect me.

31
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:20,158
When I wanted to escape these walls,

32
00:05:21,998 --> 00:05:23,998
she had brought herself in

33
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,128
to get me to safety.

34
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:32,758
She will be given a befitting funeral.

35
00:05:33,548 --> 00:05:35,178
And this will never happen again.

36
00:05:43,728 --> 00:05:45,478
Hundreds and thousands of lives

37
00:05:47,018 --> 00:05:49,648
depend on the decisions you make.

38
00:05:50,608 --> 00:05:52,318
Before acting,

39
00:05:53,358 --> 00:05:55,528
you should have considered
the consequences.

40
00:05:55,608 --> 00:05:59,868
How do you wish for me
to eliminate the meritorious subjects?

41
00:06:00,948 --> 00:06:03,038
They are not to be dealt with by justice

42
00:06:03,118 --> 00:06:04,828
and righteousness alone.

43
00:06:08,248 --> 00:06:09,248
Consort Park,

44
00:06:10,418 --> 00:06:12,798
you must surely remember
what they did to us.

45
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:16,588
I remember clearly.

46
00:06:18,218 --> 00:06:21,638
I remember how many lives
were easily lost in a single purge.

47
00:06:25,768 --> 00:06:27,768
But do you really believe
that it was only them

48
00:06:30,018 --> 00:06:31,818
who ruined my family?

49
00:06:34,778 --> 00:06:37,528
The former King's decision to protect you

50
00:06:39,158 --> 00:06:40,408
resulted in the death…

51
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:44,868
of my parents and my extended family.

52
00:06:48,168 --> 00:06:49,248
That was…

53
00:06:50,628 --> 00:06:52,668
the consequence of a king's decision.

54
00:07:17,108 --> 00:07:18,698
You had the governor

55
00:07:18,778 --> 00:07:21,488
protect the crafters
at Bamboo Grove Village.

56
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:24,868
You even fasted
so that your eunuchs and court ladies

57
00:07:25,448 --> 00:07:27,078
would not be accused of poisoning you.

58
00:07:27,578 --> 00:07:29,578
It is sad how innocent lives were lost,

59
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:32,748
but you should not reproach yourself.

60
00:07:36,258 --> 00:07:38,168
But Siwol was one of them.

61
00:07:40,338 --> 00:07:42,338
Consort Park is right.

62
00:07:43,298 --> 00:07:44,808
I caused…

63
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:48,808
these deaths.

64
00:07:52,308 --> 00:07:55,568
And as a result,
you strengthened the royal authority.

65
00:08:13,128 --> 00:08:13,998
Court Lady Choi,

66
00:08:14,078 --> 00:08:17,248
His Majesty has requested that the consort
joins him on a walk by the stables.

67
00:08:19,628 --> 00:08:21,798
He must not be aware of her being unwell.

68
00:08:29,518 --> 00:08:31,188
Inform him that I cannot.

69
00:08:41,738 --> 00:08:44,698
I am afraid Consort Park has declined.

70
00:08:50,328 --> 00:08:51,868
It seems as though her anger…

71
00:08:53,168 --> 00:08:54,918
will not easily subside.

72
00:09:05,428 --> 00:09:10,018
Ttonggeum's body will be buried
outside the Capital today.

73
00:09:10,928 --> 00:09:15,188
His Majesty ordered a funeral
to be conducted with respect.

74
00:09:16,558 --> 00:09:19,228
You should visit once she lays to rest.

75
00:09:19,898 --> 00:09:21,568
She will be expecting you.

76
00:09:30,238 --> 00:09:32,448
Report back to me
on the status of the royal office.

77
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,328
Not his chambers,

78
00:09:36,878 --> 00:09:38,128
but the royal office?

79
00:09:39,168 --> 00:09:40,168
That is correct.

80
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:49,678
It is the first day of the month?

81
00:09:50,258 --> 00:09:52,138
Yes, Your Highness.

82
00:09:54,558 --> 00:09:56,648
Should I bring you some snacks?

83
00:09:57,728 --> 00:09:58,608
Go ahead.

84
00:09:59,188 --> 00:10:00,268
Your Highness,

85
00:10:00,358 --> 00:10:03,148
Inspector Park requests an audience.

86
00:10:05,358 --> 00:10:06,908
Should I grant him entrance?

87
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:10,368
Let him enter.

88
00:10:28,338 --> 00:10:29,508
What brings you by?

89
00:10:30,138 --> 00:10:31,638
I am only here to greet you.

90
00:10:32,258 --> 00:10:33,848
I always have on the first of the month

91
00:10:33,928 --> 00:10:35,678
after the grand morning court assembly.

92
00:10:36,888 --> 00:10:37,898
Is that so?

93
00:10:39,728 --> 00:10:43,108
After having challenged me so fiercely?

94
00:10:43,188 --> 00:10:45,148
I was only fulfilling
my professional duties.

95
00:10:45,238 --> 00:10:47,908
And greeting an elder
is a duty of mine as your junior.

96
00:10:50,408 --> 00:10:51,948
The court is abundant with those

97
00:10:52,408 --> 00:10:55,578
afraid of being shunned
if found in association with me.

98
00:10:56,038 --> 00:10:58,618
You are to leave. Neglect your duties…

99
00:11:01,378 --> 00:11:03,298
like others choose to do.

100
00:11:16,978 --> 00:11:18,938
I will be back to greet you next month.

101
00:11:25,438 --> 00:11:26,488
Namsang.

102
00:11:31,738 --> 00:11:34,658
-Yes, Your Highness?
-I am grateful

103
00:11:36,448 --> 00:11:37,868
for the company.

104
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:40,578
But…

105
00:11:46,378 --> 00:11:47,588
do not come next time.

106
00:11:51,588 --> 00:11:53,508
I will not see you anymore.

107
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:28,918
I hear that the Chief Scholar
is moving to have you impeached.

108
00:12:30,418 --> 00:12:34,178
His sense of inferiority
has clouded his judgment.

109
00:12:36,098 --> 00:12:37,968
But he is still my mentor.

110
00:12:40,018 --> 00:12:41,138
Is it taking a toll on you?

111
00:12:42,138 --> 00:12:43,478
Fulfilling one's duties

112
00:12:44,648 --> 00:12:46,478
always has its difficulties.

113
00:12:58,368 --> 00:12:59,448
Yes, it has been troubling,

114
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:02,038
Father.

115
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,248
Namsang.

116
00:13:07,838 --> 00:13:08,918
Still,

117
00:13:09,798 --> 00:13:13,008
do not deviate from your troubled path.

118
00:13:14,218 --> 00:13:15,218
What you value

119
00:13:15,798 --> 00:13:17,888
is the past I desperately

120
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:20,638
wished to protect.

121
00:13:22,478 --> 00:13:24,438
That is how I taught you.

122
00:13:25,688 --> 00:13:27,558
But if it is too much to bear,

123
00:13:29,358 --> 00:13:31,228
feel free to resent me instead.

124
00:13:38,738 --> 00:13:39,618
Father.

125
00:13:40,828 --> 00:13:42,788
I would have led the same life

126
00:13:43,788 --> 00:13:46,118
no matter what you taught me.

127
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:06,598
Between the two of us,

128
00:14:07,648 --> 00:14:09,438
you must be the stronger one.

129
00:14:33,758 --> 00:14:36,878
<i>What are you planning to do
after gaining all that power?</i>

130
00:14:36,968 --> 00:14:40,218
What exactly is power to you?

131
00:14:43,638 --> 00:14:44,638
I wonder.

132
00:14:45,728 --> 00:14:47,058
Is there anything

133
00:14:47,938 --> 00:14:49,648
you actually wish to achieve?

134
00:15:09,248 --> 00:15:12,208
We report the following
with the utmost respect.

135
00:15:12,288 --> 00:15:15,048
The Queen Dowager falsified evidence

136
00:15:15,128 --> 00:15:18,718
and tried to take command of the troops
with a fake dispatch token

137
00:15:18,798 --> 00:15:22,178
revealing her traitorous crimes.

138
00:15:22,258 --> 00:15:25,138
Despite her heinous actions, she hides
behind her status as your mother.

139
00:15:25,218 --> 00:15:28,138
We urge you to value the greater good

140
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:32,108
and lawfully punish the Queen Dowager
by deposing her.

141
00:15:33,608 --> 00:15:34,778
I do not allow it.

142
00:15:36,438 --> 00:15:39,858
My mother would not
have betrayed her own son.

143
00:15:40,448 --> 00:15:42,698
The crime falls upon
the Chief Royal Secretary

144
00:15:43,618 --> 00:15:44,788
who wrote up documents in her name.

145
00:15:46,158 --> 00:15:49,458
Interrogate the Chief Royal Secretary
and uncover the crimes

146
00:15:50,288 --> 00:15:51,168
of those associated.

147
00:15:51,248 --> 00:15:52,378
Your Majesty?

148
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,048
Your Majesty!

149
00:15:56,128 --> 00:15:59,418
Your Majesty, scholars of
the Confucian Academy were either

150
00:15:59,508 --> 00:16:01,798
executed or imprisoned
for speaking their minds.

151
00:16:01,888 --> 00:16:04,598
The level of brutality gravely alarms us.

152
00:16:04,678 --> 00:16:06,058
Please investigate the Queen Dowager.

153
00:16:06,138 --> 00:16:07,098
I do not allow it.

154
00:16:07,768 --> 00:16:10,978
It must stem from the impudent loyalty
of the Chief of State Tribunal.

155
00:16:11,058 --> 00:16:13,358
He will be interrogated
and punished by exile

156
00:16:13,438 --> 00:16:15,358
should his crimes be proven.

157
00:16:15,438 --> 00:16:16,568
I do not allow it.

158
00:16:16,648 --> 00:16:19,948
It is the Office of Palace Eunuchs
that harbored a personal vendetta.

159
00:16:20,028 --> 00:16:22,278
How dare you accuse
my mother of such crimes?

160
00:16:23,658 --> 00:16:24,828
Eunuchs and adjunct overseers,

161
00:16:24,908 --> 00:16:29,198
round up all those who took advantage
of the Queen Dowager's powers.

162
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:17,958
I wish to know why you are refusing
to depose the Queen Dowager.

163
00:17:20,508 --> 00:17:21,838
Is it to punish

164
00:17:21,918 --> 00:17:24,508
the meritorious subjects
using her crimes as an excuse?

165
00:17:24,678 --> 00:17:25,548
Or is there…

166
00:17:28,388 --> 00:17:31,848
another reason?

167
00:17:38,648 --> 00:17:39,728
I cannot

168
00:17:40,818 --> 00:17:42,238
dishonor my own mother

169
00:17:43,278 --> 00:17:45,358
which will then justify
an overthrow of my regime.

170
00:17:46,488 --> 00:17:47,698
Then…

171
00:17:48,408 --> 00:17:49,948
what is it that you are attempting?

172
00:17:51,368 --> 00:17:53,208
I gave Councilor Park my order.

173
00:17:54,368 --> 00:17:55,788
<i>He is to bring me the Queen Dowager.</i>

174
00:17:56,918 --> 00:17:59,918
His Majesty is not interested
in the Queen Dowager's deposition.

175
00:17:59,998 --> 00:18:02,458
Eliminating us is his main objective.

176
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,758
The list of her crimes is not short

177
00:18:04,838 --> 00:18:07,298
and he is trying to tie them
around our necks.

178
00:18:08,848 --> 00:18:11,008
I hear His Majesty gave the order.

179
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:16,688
"Bring me the Queen Dowager."

180
00:18:18,058 --> 00:18:19,268
If you wish to live,

181
00:18:20,148 --> 00:18:22,068
you are to serve him her head.

182
00:18:24,488 --> 00:18:26,068
His Majesty cannot dishonor his mother

183
00:18:26,148 --> 00:18:28,158
nor let her live for that matter.

184
00:18:28,238 --> 00:18:32,038
Whether you persuade her
with words or by force is up to you.

185
00:18:32,118 --> 00:18:33,328
But he is pressuring you

186
00:18:33,408 --> 00:18:36,038
to find a way
that will let him be free of guilt.

187
00:18:45,878 --> 00:18:47,298
It is unacceptable.

188
00:18:49,888 --> 00:18:52,138
But the alternative will
only put us in danger.

189
00:18:52,218 --> 00:18:53,468
With a deposition being suggested--

190
00:18:53,558 --> 00:18:55,138
Forcing her abdication may be undutiful,

191
00:18:55,638 --> 00:18:57,388
but murdering her is a sin against heaven.

192
00:18:57,888 --> 00:19:00,438
No dynasty or its people

193
00:19:00,898 --> 00:19:04,728
can serve a king
who murders his own mother.

194
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:07,398
Throughout his regime,

195
00:19:07,488 --> 00:19:10,068
treason, rebellion, and mutiny

196
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:13,198
will be repeated.

197
00:19:15,698 --> 00:19:17,618
I refuse…

198
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,088
to be the one…

199
00:19:25,878 --> 00:19:28,548
who brings this country to ruin.

200
00:19:38,098 --> 00:19:41,098
Deposement will not be enough.

201
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:45,278
She will once again use filial duty
to pressure me.

202
00:19:45,358 --> 00:19:46,438
Will you

203
00:19:48,238 --> 00:19:49,858
have her assassinated?

204
00:19:49,948 --> 00:19:53,738
The meritorious subjects will do so
in order to keep their lives.

205
00:19:56,448 --> 00:19:57,618
Only then will you

206
00:19:58,708 --> 00:19:59,958
and our child

207
00:20:01,498 --> 00:20:02,918
be safe.

208
00:20:07,258 --> 00:20:10,968
I am aware that it is the easier route.

209
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:13,968
And from here on out,

210
00:20:15,508 --> 00:20:17,268
you will only choose to take…

211
00:20:19,728 --> 00:20:20,938
the easiest paths.

212
00:20:52,928 --> 00:20:56,298
Please step down on your own.

213
00:21:14,238 --> 00:21:18,198
His Majesty wishes for your death.

214
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:21,328
Refusing to depose me…

215
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,578
was his way of pressuring you to kill me.

216
00:21:28,338 --> 00:21:29,708
Will you go through with it?

217
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,718
If he orders you to kill me

218
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:36,848
for the greater good of Joseon,

219
00:21:41,848 --> 00:21:43,268
will you do it?

220
00:21:45,018 --> 00:21:46,598
It is not for the greater good.

221
00:21:47,358 --> 00:21:51,028
Killing one's own mother
is a sin against heaven.

222
00:21:51,108 --> 00:21:52,778
What if I was not the Queen Dowager?

223
00:21:52,858 --> 00:21:54,738
What if my son was not the King?

224
00:21:56,698 --> 00:21:57,658
Would you…

225
00:22:00,328 --> 00:22:03,788
still have me killed?

226
00:22:07,998 --> 00:22:11,548
You being the Queen Dowager
and also the King's mother…

227
00:22:15,548 --> 00:22:16,838
is why I refuse to kill you.

228
00:22:26,018 --> 00:22:27,018
I said

229
00:22:28,648 --> 00:22:31,438
that I would demolish
the Joseon you built.

230
00:22:38,488 --> 00:22:39,658
That thought…

231
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:45,078
has not changed.

232
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:07,018
Please do not do this!

233
00:23:08,098 --> 00:23:09,558
Please!

234
00:23:09,648 --> 00:23:11,558
Do not take me.

235
00:23:11,648 --> 00:23:14,278
Your Highness!

236
00:23:14,358 --> 00:23:16,568
Your Highness!

237
00:23:21,158 --> 00:23:23,988
Two more court maids were taken today.

238
00:23:24,078 --> 00:23:25,248
He is slowly

239
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:28,208
draining the life out of me.

240
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:33,088
Is him not questioning you
an act of filial duty

241
00:23:33,998 --> 00:23:36,168
or him preparing to go against it?

242
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:38,218
It is probably…

243
00:23:39,428 --> 00:23:40,388
the latter.

244
00:23:43,928 --> 00:23:45,638
Before his watch on me heightens,

245
00:23:45,718 --> 00:23:47,888
find me a courier
who can go in and out of the palace.

246
00:23:48,478 --> 00:23:52,108
There are a few adjunct overseers
who still owe me a favor.

247
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:55,108
There is something I must have delivered

248
00:23:57,858 --> 00:23:59,278
outside the palace.

249
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:14,038
You summoned me.

250
00:24:14,918 --> 00:24:17,208
There are no longer any appeals requesting

251
00:24:18,378 --> 00:24:20,048
the Queen Dowager's deposition.

252
00:24:20,628 --> 00:24:22,338
They have finally realized

253
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:24,758
that their lives depend on her fate.

254
00:24:26,928 --> 00:24:28,728
The Central Army Division
will be restructured

255
00:24:28,808 --> 00:24:30,268
to fall under
the Ministry of War's command.

256
00:24:31,978 --> 00:24:32,808
Your Majesty.

257
00:24:32,898 --> 00:24:36,068
The Central Army and
the meritorious subjects.

258
00:24:37,148 --> 00:24:40,398
Have them answer to you and
eliminate those loyal to Councilor Park.

259
00:24:41,238 --> 00:24:42,818
You have my full support,

260
00:24:44,198 --> 00:24:45,448
so do not fail.

261
00:24:49,538 --> 00:24:50,618
I am humbled

262
00:24:51,618 --> 00:24:52,788
by your boundless generosity.

263
00:25:05,258 --> 00:25:06,508
This cannot be allowed.

264
00:25:07,058 --> 00:25:09,308
The Central Army is governed
by the Ministry of War

265
00:25:09,388 --> 00:25:11,308
but is commanded
by the Central Army Division

266
00:25:11,388 --> 00:25:13,018
to prevent both
from having absolute power.

267
00:25:13,098 --> 00:25:14,598
The division cannot fall

268
00:25:14,688 --> 00:25:18,688
under the command of the Ministry of War
without any contingency plan.

269
00:25:25,868 --> 00:25:26,948
Your Majesty,

270
00:25:27,528 --> 00:25:31,118
you have done enough
to weaken my position within the court.

271
00:25:32,328 --> 00:25:34,998
Soon, the Sarim's rigidness
will add pressure

272
00:25:35,328 --> 00:25:38,038
and their justifications
will feel like a restraint.

273
00:25:38,128 --> 00:25:41,088
Your best option is to have
the meritorious subjects and the Sarim

274
00:25:41,168 --> 00:25:42,878
keep each other in check.

275
00:25:53,978 --> 00:25:55,688
It is about time you stop.

276
00:25:59,728 --> 00:26:01,568
What finally stopped you…

277
00:26:02,778 --> 00:26:03,948
from deposing my mother?

278
00:26:06,318 --> 00:26:08,698
What stopped you from deposing me…

279
00:26:10,578 --> 00:26:11,738
when I was Crown Prince?

280
00:26:13,288 --> 00:26:15,668
Her death brought you to a halt

281
00:26:15,748 --> 00:26:18,288
and agreeing to a royal marriage

282
00:26:20,338 --> 00:26:21,708
is how I kept my life.

283
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:24,258
Bring me a life to take

284
00:26:24,918 --> 00:26:26,338
or something that can be traded.

285
00:26:28,758 --> 00:26:30,848
Only then will I stop.

286
00:26:33,978 --> 00:26:35,728
If neither is to your liking,

287
00:26:37,598 --> 00:26:39,268
sacrifice the Queen Dowager.

288
00:26:42,148 --> 00:26:44,068
Either way, I must benefit from this.

289
00:26:56,908 --> 00:27:00,418
Does this mean that Father
will command the Central Army?

290
00:27:00,498 --> 00:27:04,008
That is correct. His Majesty wishes
to bestow him that authority.

291
00:27:05,128 --> 00:27:07,718
So do not worry about being brought in
for being associated

292
00:27:08,468 --> 00:27:09,888
with the Queen Dowager.

293
00:27:18,438 --> 00:27:20,058
Lady Cho may act out again.

294
00:27:20,148 --> 00:27:22,148
Should you not have informed her?

295
00:27:22,228 --> 00:27:25,528
His Majesty will not stop until
Councilor Park is stripped of his power.

296
00:27:25,608 --> 00:27:27,148
What good would knowing it do?

297
00:27:27,238 --> 00:27:30,158
I am worried she would cause trouble
coveting Consort Park's position.

298
00:27:30,738 --> 00:27:31,698
Leave her be.

299
00:27:32,278 --> 00:27:34,408
She only acts out because
her family secures her position.

300
00:27:40,538 --> 00:27:42,208
YEONGHWADANG

301
00:27:42,288 --> 00:27:43,958
Her maturing and learning to behave

302
00:27:45,628 --> 00:27:46,958
is what I fear more.

303
00:27:58,058 --> 00:27:59,728
You look beautiful today.

304
00:28:02,478 --> 00:28:06,398
What could I do when my sister-in-law
insisted that I wear it?

305
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:08,488
She only wants you
to be cherished by His Majesty.

306
00:28:09,238 --> 00:28:11,988
Nothing I wear
will ever make that possible.

307
00:28:12,488 --> 00:28:15,448
Not when he is already aware
of my wrongdoings.

308
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:27,798
I see you are out for a walk.

309
00:28:30,048 --> 00:28:31,008
Yes,

310
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:33,088
Your Majesty.

311
00:28:33,758 --> 00:28:35,968
Hearing that you were
only staying indoors had me worried.

312
00:28:37,138 --> 00:28:40,808
It brings me relief
to see you out and about.

313
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:45,728
I apologize for troubling you.

314
00:28:50,988 --> 00:28:52,448
Your Majesty,

315
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:54,448
I am…

316
00:28:55,408 --> 00:28:56,738
someone that you need, aren't I?

317
00:28:58,368 --> 00:29:02,828
Actually, it is my father
you wish to have by your side.

318
00:29:09,668 --> 00:29:11,878
Be angry with me instead and berate me.

319
00:29:11,968 --> 00:29:13,888
Say that I was foolish

320
00:29:13,968 --> 00:29:16,348
and that I should be
stripped of my rank and status.

321
00:29:17,638 --> 00:29:19,218
This is not a side of you I cherish.

322
00:29:21,638 --> 00:29:23,058
You scare me.

323
00:29:28,518 --> 00:29:29,478
My apologies, Your Majesty.

324
00:29:30,478 --> 00:29:31,738
I will excuse myself.

325
00:30:09,358 --> 00:30:11,858
Your Highness,
Consort Park requests an audience.

326
00:30:11,938 --> 00:30:13,068
Let her enter.

327
00:30:22,498 --> 00:30:24,408
I am relieved to see

328
00:30:25,828 --> 00:30:27,378
that you are as spirited as ever.

329
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:29,378
Why would I be dispirited?

330
00:30:29,458 --> 00:30:32,168
My garden will be
in full bloom every spring

331
00:30:32,758 --> 00:30:36,218
and I still occupy
the Queen Dowager's Palace.

332
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:41,428
That was all you needed in your life,

333
00:30:42,258 --> 00:30:44,808
but yet you chose
to carry out such heinous crimes.

334
00:30:44,888 --> 00:30:48,648
Just like His Majesty took the throne
by being the former King's eldest son,

335
00:30:48,728 --> 00:30:49,808
being the Queen Dowager

336
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:52,318
is my rightful place.

337
00:30:54,568 --> 00:30:56,988
What I did was to protect my home.

338
00:30:58,528 --> 00:31:00,158
His Majesty isn't any different.

339
00:31:00,238 --> 00:31:01,908
To protect his throne,

340
00:31:01,988 --> 00:31:06,328
he schemed with a monk
to lure me into a trap.

341
00:31:09,538 --> 00:31:11,088
And now,

342
00:31:11,168 --> 00:31:14,088
he wishes me dead.

343
00:31:20,548 --> 00:31:24,848
I see you are terrified of the bad karma
your actions have forged.

344
00:31:25,098 --> 00:31:26,518
There is no need to hide it.

345
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:31,728
Having me killed
is easier than having me deposed.

346
00:31:33,478 --> 00:31:36,318
All former kings,
after claiming their power,

347
00:31:37,488 --> 00:31:39,108
solidified it by shedding blood.

348
00:31:39,198 --> 00:31:40,358
His Majesty

349
00:31:42,028 --> 00:31:43,488
is nothing like you.

350
00:31:45,748 --> 00:31:47,908
He shall be different.

351
00:31:47,998 --> 00:31:49,578
I will make sure of it.

352
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:54,378
I will not let him take the same path…

353
00:31:57,088 --> 00:31:58,968
that you took.

354
00:32:26,788 --> 00:32:28,118
Maybe you should head back.

355
00:32:28,198 --> 00:32:30,038
Ever since you were present
at the royal office,

356
00:32:30,828 --> 00:32:33,788
the Sarim officials
have been condemning you.

357
00:32:36,088 --> 00:32:37,128
I do not doubt it.

358
00:32:38,128 --> 00:32:39,548
After all, he is strict on customs.

359
00:32:40,128 --> 00:32:41,468
Do you know Left Minister Moon?

360
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:44,598
Very well.

361
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:49,308
Eunuch Jung from the King's Palace

362
00:32:49,388 --> 00:32:53,148
forwarded the letter
from Bamboo Grove Village's governor.

363
00:32:56,358 --> 00:32:57,608
The Bamboo Grove Village?

364
00:32:58,318 --> 00:32:59,398
Yes, Your Highness.

365
00:33:00,068 --> 00:33:02,358
He says it contains what you wish to know.

366
00:33:34,348 --> 00:33:36,518
Prior to Yoo Haksoo being reinstated,

367
00:33:36,608 --> 00:33:39,528
we request a reinvestigation
into the murder of late Queen Inyoung.

368
00:33:39,608 --> 00:33:41,858
Please approve of it, Your Majesty.

369
00:33:42,068 --> 00:33:45,108
-Please approve of it, Your Majesty.
-Please approve of it, Your Majesty.

370
00:33:46,738 --> 00:33:48,488
A reinvestigation is absurd.

371
00:33:48,578 --> 00:33:52,408
The late Queen Inyoung taking her own life
may be uncovered.

372
00:33:53,078 --> 00:33:55,538
But the Sarim will not
let the matter rest.

373
00:33:56,128 --> 00:33:57,628
Catching who is responsible

374
00:33:57,708 --> 00:34:00,458
and reinstating those wrongfully accused
is what the Sarim desires.

375
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:03,548
Your Majesty, Consort Park
requests an audience.

376
00:34:04,548 --> 00:34:06,048
Let her enter.

377
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:43,838
I come to you with a request.

378
00:34:46,008 --> 00:34:49,048
I wish to visit Ttonggeum's grave
outside the Capital.

379
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,678
I will have the Capital Bureau

380
00:34:52,768 --> 00:34:54,888
set up a perimeter in advance.

381
00:34:55,678 --> 00:34:57,268
No one else will be aware of your outing.

382
00:34:59,768 --> 00:35:00,898
I am much obliged.

383
00:35:15,908 --> 00:35:16,828
Consort Park,

384
00:35:18,748 --> 00:35:21,208
the possibility of you
not letting me beside you again

385
00:35:23,048 --> 00:35:24,508
had me worried.

386
00:35:34,348 --> 00:35:35,678
I hear that

387
00:35:37,058 --> 00:35:40,148
you ordered the protection
of the crafters in Bamboo Grove Village.

388
00:35:43,938 --> 00:35:45,108
Is it true?

389
00:35:46,858 --> 00:35:48,198
I warned the governor in advance

390
00:35:49,068 --> 00:35:52,988
so that they would not
be captured like last time.

391
00:35:54,868 --> 00:35:58,578
And before consuming the poison,
you fasted.

392
00:35:59,158 --> 00:36:00,368
Because of it,

393
00:36:02,838 --> 00:36:04,588
no one was

394
00:36:05,878 --> 00:36:07,128
wrongfully accused.

395
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:09,338
The eunuchs and court ladies who serve me

396
00:36:10,048 --> 00:36:11,548
are mine to protect.

397
00:36:23,978 --> 00:36:25,268
<i>Your Majesty,</i>

398
00:36:26,358 --> 00:36:28,738
<i>you are different from the Queen Dowager.</i>

399
00:37:44,398 --> 00:37:46,148
Whose grave is this?

400
00:37:46,228 --> 00:37:49,188
Here lies someone we should never forget.

401
00:37:49,778 --> 00:37:51,398
Is she the reason

402
00:37:52,278 --> 00:37:54,738
you asked me here today?

403
00:37:57,318 --> 00:37:58,408
Councilor Park.

404
00:38:00,158 --> 00:38:02,038
Do you believe that His Majesty

405
00:38:03,078 --> 00:38:04,368
can be a benevolent king?

406
00:38:05,208 --> 00:38:06,248
I cannot be sure.

407
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:09,628
It can be said

408
00:38:09,708 --> 00:38:12,008
that a king who cannot stand harsh advice

409
00:38:13,968 --> 00:38:16,298
has the makings of a tyrant.

410
00:38:17,888 --> 00:38:21,388
Without purges and
harsh punishment of traitors,

411
00:38:22,018 --> 00:38:24,268
I will have His Majesty
become a benevolent king.

412
00:38:25,478 --> 00:38:27,348
That I promise you.

413
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:28,308
And so,

414
00:38:29,518 --> 00:38:30,818
I will…

415
00:38:31,818 --> 00:38:33,738
keep His Majesty in check.

416
00:38:34,738 --> 00:38:36,198
When he…

417
00:38:38,068 --> 00:38:39,658
is your husband?

418
00:38:39,738 --> 00:38:42,038
I currently speak as his subject.

419
00:38:43,828 --> 00:38:45,498
He is the one

420
00:38:46,168 --> 00:38:48,458
who has paved the way for me to do so.

421
00:38:50,418 --> 00:38:54,718
<i>After all, he is the one
who installed those loyal to my father.</i>

422
00:39:01,678 --> 00:39:03,598
May I ask why you had me summoned?

423
00:39:03,678 --> 00:39:05,768
I hear you appealed for the banning

424
00:39:05,848 --> 00:39:07,558
of the people's three-year
mourning period.

425
00:39:08,438 --> 00:39:11,938
It had me curious since it goes
against your Neo-Confucian beliefs.

426
00:39:12,518 --> 00:39:15,738
It is not an official's duty
to satisfy your curiosity.

427
00:39:16,568 --> 00:39:19,528
You are never to summon me
over these kinds of matters again.

428
00:39:21,948 --> 00:39:25,578
A three-year mourning period
prohibits the people to work

429
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:28,708
and earn a living.

430
00:39:28,788 --> 00:39:31,338
Many are caught and sentenced to beatings,

431
00:39:32,088 --> 00:39:34,298
so how can one disagree
to its harmful effects?

432
00:39:35,418 --> 00:39:37,468
Nobles value propriety above all else,

433
00:39:37,548 --> 00:39:40,048
but it should not be forced
onto commoners.

434
00:39:42,048 --> 00:39:43,968
Why do you believe that to be?

435
00:39:46,478 --> 00:39:49,098
My father was proud when I mastered

436
00:39:49,188 --> 00:39:51,898
<i>Elementary Learning</i> and
<i>Precious Mirror for Enlightening the Mind</i>.

437
00:39:52,558 --> 00:39:55,478
But he banned me
from reading <i>Analects of Confucius</i>.

438
00:40:00,158 --> 00:40:02,118
One of his closest friends

439
00:40:02,948 --> 00:40:04,988
told me this
while handing me <i>Doctrine of the Mean</i>.

440
00:40:07,748 --> 00:40:10,748
"Read and master it.

441
00:40:11,538 --> 00:40:13,378
The book teaches us

442
00:40:13,458 --> 00:40:16,878
that we should stay true
to the human nature bestowed upon us.

443
00:40:18,258 --> 00:40:20,048
Gender is not a factor

444
00:40:20,628 --> 00:40:22,678
when it comes to learning."

445
00:40:29,768 --> 00:40:31,018
Jeong…

446
00:40:58,588 --> 00:40:59,758
Yoo Haksoo's daughter.

447
00:41:06,558 --> 00:41:08,178
Were you the one who brought her in?

448
00:41:21,238 --> 00:41:23,568
Are you willing to go through with it?

449
00:41:23,658 --> 00:41:25,738
I wish to have my identity restored.

450
00:41:25,818 --> 00:41:27,988
And I already told you that you cannot.

451
00:41:28,738 --> 00:41:32,158
To go back to being Yoo Haksoo's daughter,

452
00:41:32,498 --> 00:41:36,748
you risk your life as well as mine.

453
00:41:36,838 --> 00:41:39,798
His Majesty appointed the scholars
who share my father's values.

454
00:41:40,548 --> 00:41:43,628
This is the last chance
to reclaim my status.

455
00:41:43,718 --> 00:41:46,508
You will soon be installed as Queen.

456
00:41:47,848 --> 00:41:49,928
Remaining my niece

457
00:41:50,388 --> 00:41:52,978
will only benefit you.

458
00:41:53,058 --> 00:41:54,728
Then, the Sarim
will try to have me deposed

459
00:41:54,978 --> 00:41:57,608
since I am the daughter
of a meritorious subject.

460
00:41:57,688 --> 00:42:00,278
The Sarim will choose
to hold their breath.

461
00:42:00,358 --> 00:42:03,068
They will not dare
to defy His Majesty's wishes.

462
00:42:03,698 --> 00:42:08,488
Not when they have witnessed
the meritorious subjects being eliminated.

463
00:42:08,578 --> 00:42:09,868
That is exactly why.

464
00:42:11,158 --> 00:42:13,158
If the court does not challenge him,

465
00:42:13,248 --> 00:42:15,248
who will be able to stop him?

466
00:42:28,598 --> 00:42:31,058
So you choose…

467
00:42:32,558 --> 00:42:34,308
to challenge him instead?

468
00:42:34,888 --> 00:42:37,518
I will not walk the same path
as you once did.

469
00:42:38,688 --> 00:42:39,978
It is why

470
00:42:40,068 --> 00:42:43,318
you must have my status reinstated.

471
00:43:05,628 --> 00:43:07,338
Your father's status will be reinstated.

472
00:43:08,048 --> 00:43:11,348
Left Minister Moon requested it today
regardless of the reinvestigation

473
00:43:11,428 --> 00:43:13,218
into my mother's murder

474
00:43:14,468 --> 00:43:15,928
and I approved.

475
00:43:18,688 --> 00:43:20,058
I am honored.

476
00:43:21,108 --> 00:43:23,278
Capturing my mother's murderer
is what they desire

477
00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:26,568
which is why I am baffled
as to why they easily backed down.

478
00:43:34,158 --> 00:43:35,288
Would it be possible

479
00:43:37,078 --> 00:43:39,458
to have my status reinstated as well?

480
00:43:43,168 --> 00:43:46,048
The Sarim will welcome me to their side.

481
00:43:46,128 --> 00:43:48,628
You know how Councilor Park is.

482
00:43:49,258 --> 00:43:50,678
In order to have you reinstated,

483
00:43:50,758 --> 00:43:53,098
we must reveal that you are not his niece.

484
00:43:54,718 --> 00:43:55,928
There is no way of knowing

485
00:43:56,018 --> 00:43:59,188
what he will do
holding it over us as leverage.

486
00:43:59,768 --> 00:44:00,768
I will…

487
00:44:01,898 --> 00:44:03,768
persuade him, Your Majesty.

488
00:44:04,148 --> 00:44:05,318
-So--
-Consort Park.

489
00:44:06,358 --> 00:44:08,068
He is not one to be pursuaded,

490
00:44:09,948 --> 00:44:11,448
but eliminated.

491
00:44:15,738 --> 00:44:19,288
Once the deed is done,
we will be free to do as we wish.

492
00:44:29,128 --> 00:44:30,798
Whatever choice I make,

493
00:44:33,008 --> 00:44:34,638
please tell me that you know

494
00:44:36,678 --> 00:44:37,848
it is for your sake.

495
00:44:43,808 --> 00:44:44,938
I am well aware of it.

496
00:44:46,358 --> 00:44:47,478
You are the one person

497
00:44:48,858 --> 00:44:51,198
I can always count to be on my side.

498
00:45:30,028 --> 00:45:31,818
Forgive my intrusion at this late hour.

499
00:45:32,198 --> 00:45:34,068
Before the division is restructured,

500
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:37,118
His Majesty ordered
that the Central Army commanders

501
00:45:37,198 --> 00:45:39,078
be punished for their sins.

502
00:45:39,658 --> 00:45:42,748
But they happened to seek refuge here
of all places.

503
00:45:43,368 --> 00:45:45,288
Take them away at once.

504
00:45:47,838 --> 00:45:49,588
Minister Cho, look here--

505
00:45:57,888 --> 00:45:59,258
This is official palace business.

506
00:45:59,808 --> 00:46:03,018
Anyone who interferes
will be punished by military law.

507
00:46:05,938 --> 00:46:07,518
-Take them away!
-Yes, my lord.

508
00:46:15,568 --> 00:46:17,278
I urge you to keep this in mind.

509
00:46:17,988 --> 00:46:21,078
His Majesty will not allow
relatives on his wife's side

510
00:46:22,078 --> 00:46:23,748
to go rampant.

511
00:46:23,828 --> 00:46:26,168
Relatives on his wife's side
who are loyal to him

512
00:46:27,458 --> 00:46:29,588
are those he needs.

513
00:46:31,418 --> 00:46:33,838
Next time, my sword
will be at your throat…

514
00:46:35,758 --> 00:46:37,178
unsheathed.

515
00:47:09,668 --> 00:47:10,588
The Minister of War

516
00:47:10,668 --> 00:47:14,298
dragged our people
out of our house like mutts.

517
00:47:15,508 --> 00:47:18,428
He must already think you are beneath him.

518
00:47:19,338 --> 00:47:21,388
It is nothing to fuss over.

519
00:47:21,468 --> 00:47:23,598
Do as His Majesty asks

520
00:47:25,978 --> 00:47:27,268
before our family is annihilated.

521
00:47:32,318 --> 00:47:33,188
My lady.

522
00:47:33,268 --> 00:47:35,108
As your wife and as a woman of rank,

523
00:47:35,488 --> 00:47:38,028
I complied with your orders
for the sake of this family.

524
00:47:39,488 --> 00:47:40,948
My life as a woman…

525
00:47:43,618 --> 00:47:44,698
was never a priority.

526
00:47:48,538 --> 00:47:50,708
It is why I say this
as the lady of this house.

527
00:47:51,878 --> 00:47:53,128
Assassinate…

528
00:47:55,548 --> 00:47:56,838
the Queen Dowager.

529
00:48:00,678 --> 00:48:03,348
Is that what you truly want?

530
00:48:33,918 --> 00:48:35,298
Jealousy got the best of me.

531
00:48:39,878 --> 00:48:41,048
Please forget what I said.

532
00:48:42,048 --> 00:48:44,718
Whenever our family's fate was at stake,

533
00:48:45,468 --> 00:48:48,638
you complied with my decisions
without any complaints.

534
00:48:53,688 --> 00:48:54,978
I am grateful.

535
00:48:59,858 --> 00:49:01,198
Once again,

536
00:49:01,698 --> 00:49:06,238
our family's fate hangs in the balance.

537
00:49:06,828 --> 00:49:08,748
Are you going to defy His Majesty?

538
00:49:09,788 --> 00:49:11,748
"Those who seek death shall live..."

539
00:49:19,008 --> 00:49:20,668
The true leader of this family

540
00:49:21,418 --> 00:49:22,548
is you, my lady.

541
00:49:39,068 --> 00:49:42,068
Has Councilor Park
still not sent any word?

542
00:49:42,818 --> 00:49:43,778
I am afraid not.

543
00:49:47,578 --> 00:49:49,828
May I ask what it is you await?

544
00:50:15,938 --> 00:50:17,228
<i>I propose a deal.</i>

545
00:50:17,308 --> 00:50:21,188
With the Sarim, officially investigate
the Queen Dowager's crimes

546
00:50:21,278 --> 00:50:24,898
and force her abdication
with those as a justification.

547
00:50:25,658 --> 00:50:26,738
I will do so.

548
00:50:26,818 --> 00:50:30,658
Will you be able to have only me

549
00:50:31,238 --> 00:50:32,828
take the fall?

550
00:50:34,118 --> 00:50:36,288
I give you my word.

551
00:50:37,998 --> 00:50:39,288
Then in return,

552
00:50:39,918 --> 00:50:42,588
I will have your status reinstated.

553
00:50:44,338 --> 00:50:45,468
Is there…

554
00:50:46,378 --> 00:50:47,548
a way?

555
00:50:48,298 --> 00:50:50,048
Only one person

556
00:50:51,308 --> 00:50:52,808
can make it happen.

557
00:50:53,728 --> 00:50:58,558
<i>Only His Majesty
can reinstate your status.</i>

558
00:51:11,658 --> 00:51:13,488
I approve the reinstatement of Yoo Haksoo

559
00:51:13,578 --> 00:51:15,788
who was executed
for the murder of Queen Inyoung.

560
00:51:16,618 --> 00:51:19,998
More than enough evidence proves
that he was framed.

561
00:51:20,588 --> 00:51:22,378
He will be reinstated
as Minister of Personnel

562
00:51:23,128 --> 00:51:24,958
and be given the epithet Chungmoon.

563
00:51:36,938 --> 00:51:40,978
I am humbled by your boundless generosity,
Your Majesty.

564
00:51:41,058 --> 00:51:42,228
-I am humbled
-I am humbled

565
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:45,688
-by your boundless generosity.
-by your boundless generosity.

566
00:51:55,948 --> 00:51:57,118
Your Majesty,

567
00:51:57,208 --> 00:52:00,458
there is also another
who must be reinstated.

568
00:52:02,248 --> 00:52:04,088
Yoo Haksoo's daughter

569
00:52:04,668 --> 00:52:07,468
who was killed as the Crown Princess.

570
00:52:09,048 --> 00:52:10,798
His daughter lives

571
00:52:11,678 --> 00:52:13,928
and I request her status be reinstated.

572
00:52:39,248 --> 00:52:40,748
The late Crown Princess is alive?

573
00:52:40,828 --> 00:52:43,498
She died in the fire after being deposed.

574
00:52:44,168 --> 00:52:46,548
She is alive, Your Majesty.

575
00:52:47,878 --> 00:52:52,178
And the fire that supposedly took her life
can be proven to have been arson.

576
00:52:53,218 --> 00:52:57,018
I requested the Ministry of Punishments
to reinvestigate the matter.

577
00:52:57,098 --> 00:52:59,478
I, the section chief of Ministry
of Punishments, greet His Majesty.

578
00:53:01,388 --> 00:53:05,518
Left State Councilor raised suspicion
regarding the fire that took place

579
00:53:05,608 --> 00:53:07,438
which prompted an investigation.

580
00:53:07,528 --> 00:53:11,528
The body of the deposed Crown Princess
was unrecognizable due to the fire

581
00:53:11,608 --> 00:53:16,448
and there was a report
of a dead body nearby going missing.

582
00:53:18,998 --> 00:53:20,458
<i>What are you playing at?</i>

583
00:53:21,578 --> 00:53:23,328
<i>Are you trying to reveal her identity</i>

584
00:53:23,828 --> 00:53:25,538
<i>to sentence her to an execution?</i>

585
00:53:27,958 --> 00:53:30,168
<i>He must be well aware
that revealing her identity</i>

586
00:53:31,088 --> 00:53:32,378
<i>will also put him in danger.</i>

587
00:53:37,308 --> 00:53:39,268
She is alive, Your Majesty.

588
00:53:40,268 --> 00:53:41,428
She…

589
00:53:42,518 --> 00:53:44,728
deceived the world, the royal family,

590
00:53:45,728 --> 00:53:49,108
and even you to set foot in this palace.

591
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:58,078
If the daughter of a traitor
entered the palace by deceiving everyone,

592
00:53:58,158 --> 00:53:59,908
she should be executed.

593
00:54:00,658 --> 00:54:02,828
But if what you are saying is a lie,

594
00:54:02,908 --> 00:54:05,458
you will pay for it with your life.

595
00:54:07,088 --> 00:54:09,168
She is someone you also know quite well.

596
00:54:16,928 --> 00:54:18,348
Your Majesty,

597
00:54:20,388 --> 00:54:22,478
she is Consort Park.

598
00:54:32,528 --> 00:54:34,108
Councilor Park!

599
00:54:39,078 --> 00:54:40,158
It seems as though

600
00:54:42,658 --> 00:54:44,708
you wish for her to die.

601
00:54:47,828 --> 00:54:49,788
<i>Only His Majesty can reinstate you.</i>

602
00:54:50,668 --> 00:54:54,088
Deceiving your husband
who is also your ruler

603
00:54:54,168 --> 00:54:56,088
is punishable by execution,

604
00:54:56,178 --> 00:54:57,718
but not if it was the husband and ruler

605
00:54:57,798 --> 00:55:00,138
who deceived the world to embrace you.

606
00:55:03,518 --> 00:55:05,018
A king has no shame

607
00:55:05,098 --> 00:55:06,848
and the matter is one
of the Internal Court.

608
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:13,688
No one would dare
to hold anyone accountable.

609
00:55:14,738 --> 00:55:16,608
I condoned it.

610
00:55:17,318 --> 00:55:20,948
Was it not I who acknowledged Consort Park

611
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:23,238
as Councilor Park's niece?

612
00:55:24,828 --> 00:55:26,578
The former King felt pity for her

613
00:55:27,328 --> 00:55:30,628
since we abandoned her
and ordered that she be saved.

614
00:55:30,708 --> 00:55:32,588
It is why I allowed her
to enter the palace.

615
00:55:33,498 --> 00:55:34,418
Consort Park…

616
00:55:36,338 --> 00:55:37,628
is innocent.

617
00:55:44,558 --> 00:55:45,518
Your Majesty,

618
00:55:45,598 --> 00:55:49,598
are you saying that Consort Park
is in fact Yoo Haksoo's daughter?

619
00:55:53,318 --> 00:55:55,608
Even if you allowed it,

620
00:55:55,688 --> 00:55:58,908
deceiving the Royal Court
as Councilor Park's niece

621
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:01,568
is an atrocious crime.

622
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:04,038
It was I who threatened her.

623
00:56:05,078 --> 00:56:07,828
The former King saved her life,

624
00:56:07,908 --> 00:56:09,958
my threats forced her into the palace,

625
00:56:11,378 --> 00:56:12,708
and His Majesty

626
00:56:14,248 --> 00:56:15,508
hid the fact

627
00:56:17,298 --> 00:56:19,048
and condoned it.

628
00:56:55,088 --> 00:56:56,668
What game are you playing?

629
00:56:57,878 --> 00:56:59,668
Did you reveal her identity

630
00:57:00,798 --> 00:57:02,758
so that she could be executed?

631
00:57:04,428 --> 00:57:05,428
Actually,

632
00:57:06,508 --> 00:57:08,388
I do not care to know.

633
00:57:08,468 --> 00:57:10,728
You confessed to threatening her

634
00:57:10,808 --> 00:57:12,648
which explains her entering the palace

635
00:57:12,728 --> 00:57:14,558
and I condoned it

636
00:57:14,648 --> 00:57:17,068
which justifies her actions to stay.

637
00:57:18,108 --> 00:57:19,108
Your Majesty,

638
00:57:20,148 --> 00:57:24,448
please consider what could have made me

639
00:57:25,158 --> 00:57:26,988
reveal the truth.

640
00:57:33,538 --> 00:57:34,878
Your reasons…

641
00:57:36,958 --> 00:57:38,418
are of no importance.

642
00:57:39,298 --> 00:57:40,918
You confessed to a crime

643
00:57:42,468 --> 00:57:43,878
and now you will pay for it.

644
00:57:45,548 --> 00:57:47,048
Have the State Tribunal

645
00:57:48,098 --> 00:57:49,848
imprison Left State Councilor Park Gyewon.

646
00:57:49,928 --> 00:57:52,688
Your order is my command.

647
00:58:06,528 --> 00:58:07,698
I told you to annihilate

648
00:58:09,118 --> 00:58:10,748
Councilor Park's family.

649
00:58:11,408 --> 00:58:13,998
I told you to have the Sarim

650
00:58:15,038 --> 00:58:16,748
make an official appeal,

651
00:58:18,248 --> 00:58:20,958
-but you refuse to do so.
-Your Majesty,

652
00:58:21,048 --> 00:58:25,338
official appeals are to be made
by the subjects, not the ruler himself.

653
00:58:27,388 --> 00:58:29,388
Please accept my loyal advice.

654
00:58:35,438 --> 00:58:37,228
Loyal advice or not,

655
00:58:38,438 --> 00:58:40,068
I simply do not care.

656
00:58:41,188 --> 00:58:43,028
Councilor Park is your mortal enemy.

657
00:58:43,398 --> 00:58:45,358
Why do you not want him
to answer to his crimes?

658
00:58:45,448 --> 00:58:46,818
Determining…

659
00:58:47,818 --> 00:58:49,738
the weight of his crimes must come first.

660
00:58:49,828 --> 00:58:51,828
Who are you to decide that?

661
00:58:52,698 --> 00:58:54,368
It was ordered

662
00:58:55,828 --> 00:58:57,378
by Consort Park whom he threatened.

663
00:58:59,588 --> 00:59:00,878
Consort Park?

664
00:59:09,598 --> 00:59:10,598
<i>Are you saying</i>

665
00:59:12,008 --> 00:59:13,638
that she is aware
of Councilor Park's actions?

666
00:59:14,268 --> 00:59:15,228
Yes, Your Majesty.

667
00:59:15,938 --> 00:59:17,228
How though?

668
00:59:18,648 --> 00:59:20,148
It is my belief

669
00:59:21,938 --> 00:59:23,778
that this was a collaborative decision.

670
01:00:10,988 --> 01:00:12,028
Did Councilor Park

671
01:00:13,118 --> 01:00:14,948
threaten you again?

672
01:00:18,828 --> 01:00:20,458
That is what I thought.

673
01:00:21,288 --> 01:00:23,958
You and Councilor Park forming an alliance
to take advantage of me?

674
01:00:25,208 --> 01:00:26,958
It is preposterous.

675
01:00:28,588 --> 01:00:29,468
Your Majesty…

676
01:00:32,468 --> 01:00:36,558
I will interrogate him myself
and have him speak the truth.

677
01:00:38,018 --> 01:00:39,138
It was I.

678
01:00:41,148 --> 01:00:42,348
It was I

679
01:00:43,188 --> 01:00:45,568
who formed an alliance
with Councilor Park.

680
01:00:47,898 --> 01:00:50,528
Once the Sarim fill in
for the meritorious subjects,

681
01:00:51,318 --> 01:00:54,488
you will divide them
in order to seize the power they have.

682
01:00:55,278 --> 01:00:56,988
When power shifts too much to one side,

683
01:00:57,078 --> 01:00:59,958
you will initiate a purge
to eliminate any threats.

684
01:01:00,708 --> 01:01:03,208
By arousing conflict and dividing,

685
01:01:04,588 --> 01:01:06,628
you will try to dominate your people.

686
01:01:06,708 --> 01:01:07,708
Because…

687
01:01:09,088 --> 01:01:11,048
it is the easiest way for you.

688
01:01:16,308 --> 01:01:17,388
I am afraid

689
01:01:19,768 --> 01:01:22,688
I cannot let you obsess
over the power of royal authority

690
01:01:22,768 --> 01:01:25,358
which will lead to purges
and the imprisonment of your subjects.

691
01:01:26,478 --> 01:01:30,148
I cannot let you suffer
the pain they entail.

692
01:01:32,568 --> 01:01:33,738
Are you saying…

693
01:01:36,238 --> 01:01:38,198
you would rather be my enemy?

694
01:01:43,118 --> 01:01:44,998
When you of all people

695
01:01:46,708 --> 01:01:48,798
are aware of how my life has been?

696
01:01:51,468 --> 01:01:53,508
When I am finally close to strengthening

697
01:01:54,928 --> 01:01:56,098
the royal authority--

698
01:01:56,178 --> 01:01:57,758
There will be no end to it.

699
01:02:00,768 --> 01:02:02,228
That is why I chose this path.

700
01:02:02,808 --> 01:02:03,638
No.

701
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:07,308
No, you are to stop.

702
01:02:08,688 --> 01:02:10,188
You must stop.

703
01:02:13,398 --> 01:02:14,988
If you choose to stand against me,

704
01:02:18,198 --> 01:02:19,288
I will…

705
01:02:24,248 --> 01:02:26,328
have to eliminate you.

706
01:02:40,258 --> 01:02:43,268
BLOODY HEART

707
01:03:03,748 --> 01:03:06,288
Councilor Park Gyewon is
the one who caused everything.

708
01:03:06,368 --> 01:03:07,668
<i>He'll be held responsible.</i>

709
01:03:07,748 --> 01:03:10,538
<i>The King must be trying to annihilate
everyone who's on my side.</i>

710
01:03:10,628 --> 01:03:14,838
<i>Your reign is
completely your responsibility.</i>

711
01:03:14,918 --> 01:03:17,128
<i>I am not your enemy, Your Majesty.</i>

712
01:03:17,218 --> 01:03:18,138
<i>Please accept me.</i>

713
01:03:18,638 --> 01:03:19,968
You must accept me.

714
01:03:20,048 --> 01:03:21,138
<i>Please do not waver.</i>

715
01:03:21,218 --> 01:03:22,888
<i>I only hoped to protect.</i>

716
01:03:22,968 --> 01:03:25,768
<i>The one thing that made
the ones I missed return and visit</i>

717
01:03:25,848 --> 01:03:26,978
<i>was power.</i>

718
01:03:28,228 --> 01:03:29,098
<i>I shall</i>

719
01:03:29,648 --> 01:03:31,228
<i>continue on my path.</i>

720
01:03:32,108 --> 01:03:33,648
<i>Please do so, Your Majesty.</i>

721
01:03:34,188 --> 01:03:35,858
<i>Go down your own path.</i>

722
01:03:36,198 --> 01:03:38,198
