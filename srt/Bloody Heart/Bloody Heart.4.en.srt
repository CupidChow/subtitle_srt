1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:05,460
BLOODY HEART

2
00:00:06,227 --> 00:00:09,147
THE PEOPLE, GROUPS, PLACES, AND INCIDENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE PURELY FICTIONAL

3
00:00:14,157 --> 00:00:18,657
You will take part in the queen selection
under my niece's name.

4
00:00:19,157 --> 00:00:20,247
And you shall…

5
00:00:21,247 --> 00:00:22,577
become…

6
00:00:24,077 --> 00:00:25,667
the Queen of this country.

7
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:30,837
How much do you know about me
to suggest such a proposal?

8
00:00:32,177 --> 00:00:33,047
Why…

9
00:00:34,047 --> 00:00:36,507
have you chosen me?

10
00:00:36,597 --> 00:00:40,057
Knowing the reason
will not change anything.

11
00:00:43,437 --> 00:00:44,647
It is not possible.

12
00:00:45,057 --> 00:00:47,817
How can I possibly deceive His Majesty
and the royal family?

13
00:00:48,977 --> 00:00:51,397
Even you will be punished if I am caught.

14
00:00:51,937 --> 00:00:55,277
It is a crime punishable
by execution and family annihilation.

15
00:00:55,907 --> 00:01:00,037
Then that means
my life and the fate of my family

16
00:01:00,117 --> 00:01:01,947
lie in your hands.

17
00:01:05,957 --> 00:01:07,667
Oh, dear.

18
00:01:15,297 --> 00:01:19,467
Before my family is annihilated,
I will make sure to slaughter yours first.

19
00:01:20,137 --> 00:01:23,347
Any friend of yours will also be hanged.

20
00:01:23,427 --> 00:01:26,397
Everyone you value and love…

21
00:01:31,317 --> 00:01:32,937
will be quartered.

22
00:02:03,677 --> 00:02:06,227
<i>I most definitely heard
that his niece resides in the annex,</i>

23
00:02:08,147 --> 00:02:09,517
<i>so why?</i>

24
00:02:11,437 --> 00:02:13,987
<i>Why did he choose
to put me of all people in her place?</i>

25
00:02:26,707 --> 00:02:27,617
Eat.

26
00:02:33,247 --> 00:02:36,337
Madame, why are you willingly
participating in this outrageous deed?

27
00:02:37,297 --> 00:02:39,837
-Please dissuade him--
-Refrain from talking.

28
00:02:41,217 --> 00:02:43,677
Within the palace walls,
running your mouth can get you killed.

29
00:02:44,677 --> 00:02:46,557
-Madame--
-Always stay collected.

30
00:02:47,557 --> 00:02:50,347
The nation's queen
should never show her emotions.

31
00:02:55,067 --> 00:02:58,647
Starting tomorrow, I will personally
educate you on royal etiquette.

32
00:02:59,237 --> 00:03:01,117
Where is my mentor?

33
00:03:01,817 --> 00:03:03,027
Has he received treatment?

34
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:06,367
A physician is seeing him,
so do not be worried.

35
00:03:07,407 --> 00:03:10,917
Then where is the niece
who should rightfully occupy this room?

36
00:03:13,877 --> 00:03:15,047
Where is she?

37
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:18,587
Do not inquire.

38
00:03:19,797 --> 00:03:23,007
It is in your best interest not to know.

39
00:03:26,267 --> 00:03:27,347
Mother.

40
00:03:30,347 --> 00:03:31,437
When did you get home?

41
00:03:32,687 --> 00:03:33,807
Just now.

42
00:03:33,897 --> 00:03:35,267
Has all been well?

43
00:03:36,027 --> 00:03:37,067
Of course.

44
00:03:38,027 --> 00:03:40,277
You should greet your father first.

45
00:03:41,317 --> 00:03:42,777
I already have.

46
00:03:45,447 --> 00:03:46,947
You must be Aok.

47
00:03:47,037 --> 00:03:50,037
I am your elder cousin. We finally meet.

48
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:54,087
<i>Councilor Park's only son.</i>

49
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,627
<i>The third inspector of
the Office of Inspector General.</i>

50
00:03:56,547 --> 00:04:00,547
<i>He is rumored to be a righteous noble
who abides by moral laws.</i>

51
00:04:01,217 --> 00:04:03,007
Aok must rest today,

52
00:04:04,257 --> 00:04:05,597
so greet her some other time.

53
00:04:05,677 --> 00:04:06,967
Cousin.

54
00:04:13,977 --> 00:04:15,897
I will greet you tomorrow.

55
00:04:19,317 --> 00:04:21,317
Sure. Tomorrow it is.

56
00:04:21,897 --> 00:04:23,407
I will come by the annex.

57
00:04:45,887 --> 00:04:49,177
It is one of the old poems
that stood out to me.

58
00:04:51,097 --> 00:04:52,307
Will you…

59
00:04:54,097 --> 00:04:55,557
accept this?

60
00:05:04,697 --> 00:05:05,607
Your Majesty,

61
00:05:05,697 --> 00:05:07,527
you are to be present at the royal office.

62
00:05:09,577 --> 00:05:11,537
I guess I should tell her.

63
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:17,497
Keeping the truth from her
is not an option anymore.

64
00:05:19,917 --> 00:05:21,837
I will tell her who I am…

65
00:05:24,507 --> 00:05:25,837
and finally…

66
00:05:28,467 --> 00:05:29,927
let her go.

67
00:05:41,187 --> 00:05:43,737
BLOODY HEART
EPISODE 4

68
00:05:53,117 --> 00:05:55,327
Master Park, what brings you by?

69
00:05:56,117 --> 00:05:58,037
I hear Aok's guests are here.

70
00:05:58,127 --> 00:06:00,127
Why are guests at the servants' quarters?

71
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:04,757
Lord Park ordered that no one enters.

72
00:06:04,837 --> 00:06:06,877
I have something for them.

73
00:06:07,507 --> 00:06:10,137
Do not worry for I will not stay long.

74
00:06:40,787 --> 00:06:42,127
My goodness!

75
00:06:42,207 --> 00:06:44,457
Help us. Please.

76
00:06:44,547 --> 00:06:46,087
-Call a physician.
-Look here.

77
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:47,127
My stomach!

78
00:06:47,217 --> 00:06:49,257
They are vomiting. Time is of the essence.

79
00:06:49,337 --> 00:06:51,137
-Take the other one.
-My goodness.

80
00:06:51,217 --> 00:06:52,717
Help us.

81
00:06:52,807 --> 00:06:56,267
But Lord Park ordered
for neither of them to leave!

82
00:06:56,347 --> 00:06:57,597
Master Park!

83
00:06:57,687 --> 00:06:59,807
My stomach!

84
00:07:01,517 --> 00:07:03,687
My stomach is killing me!

85
00:07:04,727 --> 00:07:06,237
<i>The one delivering the letter</i>

86
00:07:06,317 --> 00:07:08,987
<i>knows me as his cousin
and is showing me kindness.</i>

87
00:07:10,737 --> 00:07:13,157
<i>Use him to get out
of Councilor Park's house.</i>

88
00:07:14,907 --> 00:07:18,407
<i>The kind and noble man
will not turn his back away from the sick.</i>

89
00:07:25,747 --> 00:07:29,087
<i>Head to the land we prepared
in Gyeongsang Province.</i>

90
00:07:29,677 --> 00:07:31,387
<i>I will join you soon.</i>

91
00:08:08,207 --> 00:08:09,967
Cousin, you came.

92
00:08:23,477 --> 00:08:24,557
I feel terrible.

93
00:08:25,607 --> 00:08:28,897
I took your mentor
to see a physician for the vomiting,

94
00:08:29,647 --> 00:08:31,697
but he disappeared
while I let my mind wander.

95
00:08:34,277 --> 00:08:36,657
Where could he have gone in such pain?

96
00:08:39,447 --> 00:08:41,327
His condition must have improved.

97
00:08:49,337 --> 00:08:53,047
Can you not tell me what this is about?

98
00:08:58,387 --> 00:09:00,557
I am only asking to be of help.

99
00:09:09,937 --> 00:09:12,357
Madame Yoon looks out for me,

100
00:09:14,357 --> 00:09:15,907
I am in no need of further assistance.

101
00:09:20,947 --> 00:09:24,287
Please let me know
if there is anything I can help you with.

102
00:09:24,867 --> 00:09:27,787
As your cousin,
I will do what I can to help.

103
00:10:08,627 --> 00:10:10,667
Today, you will master
<i>Instructions for Women</i>.

104
00:10:11,497 --> 00:10:13,917
-Let us read--
-Allow me to see Councilor Park.

105
00:10:15,717 --> 00:10:17,127
How audacious of you.

106
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:20,507
I will not partake in the queen selection.

107
00:10:22,717 --> 00:10:24,637
If you still order me to,

108
00:10:25,557 --> 00:10:27,267
I will expose who I am

109
00:10:27,347 --> 00:10:30,437
in front of the Queen Dowager
and the royal family.

110
00:10:59,217 --> 00:11:00,927
Just let me go.

111
00:11:02,927 --> 00:11:06,767
Do so, and I will take
this affair to the grave.

112
00:11:07,977 --> 00:11:10,017
You will not partake
in the queen selection?

113
00:11:10,517 --> 00:11:12,147
Should I not return,

114
00:11:12,517 --> 00:11:15,607
my mentor will write complaints
to the Police Bureau and State Tribunal.

115
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:18,897
If you still choose to keep me here,

116
00:11:20,607 --> 00:11:24,157
I will make a report to your son,
who's in the Office of Inspector General.

117
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:27,367
Being as noble as he is,

118
00:11:27,747 --> 00:11:30,167
he will have me inspected.

119
00:11:31,377 --> 00:11:33,037
If the crime is minor,

120
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:35,457
he will investigate
even though I'm his father.

121
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:38,007
However, he is also
a member of this family.

122
00:11:39,297 --> 00:11:43,297
A crime that would have
his father executed, his mother enslaved,

123
00:11:43,847 --> 00:11:47,267
and his grandparents, uncles,
aunts, cousins beheaded?

124
00:11:50,137 --> 00:11:51,977
A crime that could annihilate his family?

125
00:11:52,597 --> 00:11:57,187
Even the noblest government official
will find it hard to bear.

126
00:12:09,747 --> 00:12:10,577
Speak.

127
00:12:12,037 --> 00:12:15,497
The crafters have left the capital
and are headed to Gyeongsang Province.

128
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:19,337
Keep following them.

129
00:12:20,877 --> 00:12:22,007
Yes, my lord.

130
00:12:29,427 --> 00:12:30,727
It is the 15th.

131
00:12:34,557 --> 00:12:35,977
You met with him

132
00:12:37,227 --> 00:12:39,317
every 15 days at Daegwangtong Bridge.

133
00:13:07,717 --> 00:13:09,597
I will leave you to decide the order.

134
00:13:10,597 --> 00:13:15,347
Your mentor, the crafter,
the workshop in Bamboo Grove Village,

135
00:13:18,187 --> 00:13:19,227
and the young noble.

136
00:13:22,187 --> 00:13:24,527
Whose life should I take first?

137
00:13:35,497 --> 00:13:36,577
My lord!

138
00:13:38,707 --> 00:13:41,547
Disobeying your order
is worthy of capital punishment,

139
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:44,837
but I beg for your mercy.

140
00:13:46,757 --> 00:13:48,217
Raise your head.

141
00:13:52,807 --> 00:13:54,477
I told you to raise your head.

142
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:02,397
From this moment on,

143
00:14:02,897 --> 00:14:06,107
you will not lower your head to anyone.

144
00:14:07,197 --> 00:14:08,487
You…

145
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,577
will become…

146
00:14:12,367 --> 00:14:14,407
the Queen of this country.

147
00:15:11,257 --> 00:15:13,387
<i>Did she have to leave in a hurry?</i>

148
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:29,647
<i>It does not fall entirely on the nobles.</i>

149
00:15:31,067 --> 00:15:32,817
The royal family sees the people

150
00:15:32,907 --> 00:15:34,737
as ignorant fools
rather than those to serve,

151
00:15:34,827 --> 00:15:38,207
so how can nobles in official positions
suggest policies that benefit the people?

152
00:15:38,707 --> 00:15:40,537
It can also be said that the people

153
00:15:40,617 --> 00:15:42,537
do not see the royals
as those to serve either.

154
00:15:44,207 --> 00:15:45,207
That is right.

155
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:48,667
The people serve something else entirely.

156
00:16:05,147 --> 00:16:08,277
What people serve is rice.

157
00:16:12,857 --> 00:16:14,237
<i>She did not leave.</i>

158
00:16:15,527 --> 00:16:17,237
<i>She is either on the run
or has been taken.</i>

159
00:16:36,717 --> 00:16:38,347
Send someone to Bamboo Grove Village.

160
00:16:39,177 --> 00:16:41,267
I think something happened to the lady.

161
00:16:44,557 --> 00:16:45,687
Find her.

162
00:16:47,767 --> 00:16:48,937
She must be found.

163
00:16:50,237 --> 00:16:52,947
Please ask around for me.

164
00:16:53,027 --> 00:16:54,607
I am sure she is here.

165
00:16:54,697 --> 00:16:58,287
I saw her enter this house
with my very own eyes!

166
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,327
I know nothing about it!

167
00:17:00,407 --> 00:17:01,447
Then…

168
00:17:01,537 --> 00:17:05,457
please tell Hyang
that Ttonggeum is waiting for her.

169
00:17:05,537 --> 00:17:07,587
There is no one by that name here!

170
00:17:08,207 --> 00:17:09,377
I do not know anything.

171
00:17:10,087 --> 00:17:12,797
And being nosy will get us both
beaten to death.

172
00:17:12,877 --> 00:17:14,677
What do you mean Hyang is not here?

173
00:17:14,757 --> 00:17:16,887
Hold on. Wait. Why is she not--

174
00:17:17,007 --> 00:17:20,267
Please! Just this once…

175
00:17:23,847 --> 00:17:24,807
Oh, no.

176
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:27,687
What now?

177
00:18:24,197 --> 00:18:25,707
Miss?

178
00:18:26,457 --> 00:18:27,457
Hold on a second.

179
00:20:15,227 --> 00:20:16,397
Why…

180
00:20:16,817 --> 00:20:21,107
Why is Miss entering the palace?

181
00:20:24,487 --> 00:20:26,367
I had payments to receive,

182
00:20:26,447 --> 00:20:28,077
but she fell off the face of the earth.

183
00:20:28,867 --> 00:20:30,867
It is not like
the crafter lady to do this.

184
00:20:31,657 --> 00:20:32,867
Do not get me started.

185
00:20:32,957 --> 00:20:35,377
She took off after promising
to pay for the ruined silk.

186
00:20:46,007 --> 00:20:48,967
<i>The first screening? Lord Park's niece
who resides in the annex?</i>

187
00:20:49,347 --> 00:20:50,727
<i>Do not go anywhere near there.</i>

188
00:20:51,057 --> 00:20:54,307
<i>The place was heavily guarded
and none of us got a glimpse of her face.</i>

189
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,477
<i>I hear she will become the Queen for sure.</i>

190
00:20:58,107 --> 00:21:02,737
Why did Miss head to the palace
in his niece's place?

191
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,197
What is going on, Miss?

192
00:21:07,277 --> 00:21:09,867
I am worried sick for you.

193
00:21:11,197 --> 00:21:12,117
Sorry?

194
00:21:12,207 --> 00:21:14,617
You will take Maksool as your court maid?

195
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:18,167
She will not embarrass me
being pretty and all.

196
00:21:19,497 --> 00:21:22,587
Thanks to you, the lowlife
will get to live in the palace.

197
00:21:22,837 --> 00:21:24,087
Lucky her.

198
00:21:24,677 --> 00:21:27,507
It sure must be nice to be her.

199
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:30,267
New clothes, new shoes,

200
00:21:30,347 --> 00:21:31,677
-and delicious food.
-The palace?

201
00:21:32,887 --> 00:21:35,437
I hear you told everyone that I like Kim.

202
00:21:35,517 --> 00:21:37,307
Why are you spreading lies?

203
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:41,067
But you said that Kim is dependable.

204
00:21:41,147 --> 00:21:43,567
I did not exactly make anything up.

205
00:21:43,647 --> 00:21:46,987
I will pick out my own accessories.
I have better taste.

206
00:21:47,367 --> 00:21:50,487
But it is a gift to you from my wife.

207
00:21:50,737 --> 00:21:53,327
-Just pretend to like it.
-You lovesick fool.

208
00:21:53,497 --> 00:21:55,867
That is what you said!

209
00:21:55,957 --> 00:21:59,167
Apparently, you can seduce any man
with that hip of yours.

210
00:21:59,247 --> 00:22:01,587
Even His Majesty!

211
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:02,757
When did I--

212
00:22:02,837 --> 00:22:05,677
How dare you think about
seducing His Majesty

213
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:07,137
before the queen selection?

214
00:22:07,217 --> 00:22:10,217
I bet you will flirt with him
once you step inside the palace.

215
00:22:10,307 --> 00:22:12,387
As if I would let you!

216
00:22:12,467 --> 00:22:15,847
-Let go!
-Anyone who humiliates Lady Yeonhee

217
00:22:15,937 --> 00:22:18,347
will answer to me!

218
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:19,517
Girls!

219
00:22:20,227 --> 00:22:21,897
Stop this immediately!

220
00:22:22,817 --> 00:22:23,857
My goodness.

221
00:22:24,397 --> 00:22:27,157
Is this how you teach your juniors?

222
00:22:27,277 --> 00:22:30,067
My apologies, my lady.
They will be rolled up and beaten.

223
00:22:30,737 --> 00:22:33,867
-You two, come with me.
-Oh, gosh.

224
00:22:33,947 --> 00:22:36,247
But Ttonggeum started it!

225
00:22:36,327 --> 00:22:38,707
-Yeonhee!
-She is the one…

226
00:22:38,787 --> 00:22:40,037
Please!

227
00:22:41,207 --> 00:22:43,877
What fine weather we have.

228
00:22:44,507 --> 00:22:45,587
Brother,

229
00:22:46,217 --> 00:22:49,757
does His Majesty sometimes show affection
toward a queen's court maid?

230
00:22:50,757 --> 00:22:53,557
Of course. At the Queen's Palace,

231
00:22:53,637 --> 00:22:56,477
she is who he sees the most
apart from the queen herself.

232
00:22:57,307 --> 00:23:00,977
Come to think of it,
Maksool has been blooming.

233
00:23:01,607 --> 00:23:03,317
His Majesty may take a liking to her.

234
00:23:03,397 --> 00:23:06,357
How dare you assume
the lowest of His Majesty!

235
00:23:07,647 --> 00:23:09,527
Take someone else if it bothers you.

236
00:23:09,947 --> 00:23:13,407
The best quality in servants is loyalty.

237
00:23:16,157 --> 00:23:17,707
Loyalty?

238
00:23:19,827 --> 00:23:22,087
Eunuch Jung was looking for the lady.

239
00:23:27,877 --> 00:23:31,967
His Majesty's affection for her
runs deeper than I expected.

240
00:23:34,757 --> 00:23:38,767
Continue to watch Eunuch Jung.

241
00:24:01,247 --> 00:24:02,997
I hear you have the gift.

242
00:24:05,587 --> 00:24:09,547
The spirit I serve
has great powers, Your Highness.

243
00:24:10,427 --> 00:24:12,717
All I do is listen to her.

244
00:24:15,137 --> 00:24:16,387
Then tell me…

245
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:19,927
What is she currently saying?

246
00:24:22,847 --> 00:24:28,027
She tells me that
your heart's desire will be fulfilled.

247
00:24:29,487 --> 00:24:31,817
A failed prediction
will cost you your life.

248
00:24:35,487 --> 00:24:36,447
Answer me again.

249
00:24:37,077 --> 00:24:40,077
What is she saying this time?

250
00:24:42,077 --> 00:24:43,367
That your heart's desire…

251
00:24:44,707 --> 00:24:46,207
will only be half-fulfilled.

252
00:24:48,547 --> 00:24:49,877
Your Highness,

253
00:24:49,957 --> 00:24:53,217
all I do is convey the spirit's words!

254
00:24:54,427 --> 00:24:56,677
The spirit you worship
must be out to end you.

255
00:24:57,597 --> 00:24:59,517
As I am the Queen Dowager,

256
00:24:59,597 --> 00:25:01,517
it is harder for the selection
to not go my way.

257
00:25:03,517 --> 00:25:05,097
We will wait and see.

258
00:25:16,197 --> 00:25:17,117
Your Highness.

259
00:25:17,657 --> 00:25:18,487
What?

260
00:25:18,987 --> 00:25:21,497
Have there been complaints about

261
00:25:22,037 --> 00:25:24,827
shamans in my chambers
being a sign of ruin?

262
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:27,037
As if anyone would dare.

263
00:25:27,627 --> 00:25:28,457
Save it.

264
00:25:30,127 --> 00:25:32,717
I'm sure Councilor Park
will keep word from spreading.

265
00:25:35,387 --> 00:25:37,967
How am I to survive my boring life…

266
00:25:40,807 --> 00:25:43,227
if I do not find entertainment
within these walls?

267
00:26:14,797 --> 00:26:16,507
<i>She's bad luck.</i>

268
00:26:17,007 --> 00:26:18,847
<i>Leave her and get the hell out of here.</i>

269
00:26:33,397 --> 00:26:34,527
No…

270
00:26:36,197 --> 00:26:37,357
Wait.

271
00:26:39,067 --> 00:26:42,027
Help. Please…

272
00:26:44,037 --> 00:26:45,407
Please help.

273
00:26:47,287 --> 00:26:49,497
Please…

274
00:27:48,347 --> 00:27:51,397
It's hot. You don't want to burn yourself.

275
00:27:57,317 --> 00:27:59,737
There is much to eat,
so how about you slow down?

276
00:28:02,407 --> 00:28:04,277
This was made for you.

277
00:28:04,367 --> 00:28:06,407
Eat it slowly to finish it all.

278
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:10,617
For me?

279
00:28:12,287 --> 00:28:14,337
-All for me?
-Eat it all.

280
00:28:14,917 --> 00:28:18,007
You will eat well, take your medicine,
and get better, all right?

281
00:28:26,427 --> 00:28:27,427
Miss.

282
00:28:28,057 --> 00:28:30,557
Just hold on until I get there.

283
00:28:33,187 --> 00:28:36,857
I will do everything I can to save you.

284
00:29:06,233 --> 00:29:07,153
What did you find out?

285
00:29:09,233 --> 00:29:11,363
It looks like something bad happened,
just as you said.

286
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:13,283
I have sent a messenger,

287
00:29:13,363 --> 00:29:16,533
but there is no way to know when
the crafters will arrive at the village.

288
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,923
You cannot come.

289
00:29:32,553 --> 00:29:33,843
I can.

290
00:29:33,923 --> 00:29:35,763
I do not want you to!

291
00:29:38,223 --> 00:29:39,803
My world is…

292
00:29:43,643 --> 00:29:46,143
a place you can't live in.

293
00:31:00,343 --> 00:31:02,593
Your Majesty,
to what do I owe the pleasure?

294
00:31:11,023 --> 00:31:13,773
Why did you not tell me

295
00:31:14,903 --> 00:31:16,903
that His Majesty was attending
the second screening?

296
00:31:16,983 --> 00:31:19,693
I myself did not receive any word.

297
00:31:20,653 --> 00:31:21,743
Then,

298
00:31:23,113 --> 00:31:26,533
am I to believe you came by unexpectedly?

299
00:31:27,543 --> 00:31:28,663
I was hoping…

300
00:31:29,793 --> 00:31:31,753
to take a look inside.

301
00:31:32,543 --> 00:31:34,253
For what reason?

302
00:31:36,923 --> 00:31:37,963
Your Majesty,

303
00:31:38,553 --> 00:31:42,553
it is inappropriate to partake in an event
without notifying your elder.

304
00:31:45,723 --> 00:31:47,853
How inconsiderate of me.

305
00:31:49,473 --> 00:31:50,433
Please enter,

306
00:31:51,433 --> 00:31:52,523
Mother.

307
00:31:59,533 --> 00:32:01,033
Is everything all right?

308
00:32:02,493 --> 00:32:04,413
It seems as though I was mistaken.

309
00:32:07,033 --> 00:32:08,953
Of course she would not be here.

310
00:32:13,423 --> 00:32:16,383
She is the daughter of Jinsa Park Soonduk.

311
00:32:58,173 --> 00:32:59,633
I made my decision.

312
00:32:59,963 --> 00:33:02,803
You can discuss it with your subjects
and make the announcement.

313
00:33:03,383 --> 00:33:05,473
Is there a lady you deem worthy?

314
00:33:06,183 --> 00:33:08,763
The niece
of Left State Councilor Park Gyewon.

315
00:33:14,393 --> 00:33:16,233
Then we have an issue

316
00:33:17,103 --> 00:33:20,653
for she is not the lady I have in mind.

317
00:33:22,113 --> 00:33:23,153
Then,

318
00:33:24,493 --> 00:33:26,243
would you go against my wishes?

319
00:33:26,493 --> 00:33:27,953
Is it because you look down on me…

320
00:33:28,993 --> 00:33:30,663
as I am not your birth mother?

321
00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:32,243
Mother.

322
00:33:34,873 --> 00:33:36,873
That is preposterous.

323
00:33:37,543 --> 00:33:40,083
I am sure His Majesty is aware

324
00:33:41,463 --> 00:33:44,053
that disobeying one's parents
is grounds for deposition.

325
00:33:51,263 --> 00:33:54,723
I only remind you out of motherly concern.

326
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:03,363
I will respect

327
00:34:04,233 --> 00:34:05,743
your wishes,

328
00:34:07,533 --> 00:34:08,613
Mother.

329
00:35:02,503 --> 00:35:03,463
Your Majesty,

330
00:35:03,543 --> 00:35:06,173
I, Left Minister No Kyungmoon,
address you.

331
00:35:06,253 --> 00:35:07,463
It is custom to adhere

332
00:35:07,553 --> 00:35:09,883
to the Queen Dowager's wishes
regarding the queen selection.

333
00:35:09,973 --> 00:35:13,683
I also agree with said custom.

334
00:35:16,603 --> 00:35:19,643
I, Minister of Personnel Ou Hanyul,
address His Majesty.

335
00:35:19,733 --> 00:35:22,943
Could there be another maiden
who has caught your eyes?

336
00:35:23,903 --> 00:35:25,653
It is uneasy of me to say this,

337
00:35:27,573 --> 00:35:30,703
but Maiden Cho
whom I accidentally encountered

338
00:35:30,783 --> 00:35:32,953
seemed wise and honorable
as a queen should be.

339
00:35:33,243 --> 00:35:36,493
However, my mother seems
to believe the same for Maiden Park,

340
00:35:36,583 --> 00:35:38,243
so how may one go about this?

341
00:35:38,623 --> 00:35:40,123
Your Majesty, the queen selection

342
00:35:40,203 --> 00:35:42,873
has always been decided
by the Queen Dowager.

343
00:35:42,963 --> 00:35:45,923
However, it is His Majesty
who is the one to wed.

344
00:35:46,003 --> 00:35:48,173
As the father of all people,

345
00:35:48,253 --> 00:35:50,133
he must set an example.

346
00:35:50,213 --> 00:35:52,433
The people will never be at ease

347
00:35:52,513 --> 00:35:54,053
if he is not fond of his own wife.

348
00:35:54,643 --> 00:35:56,553
That is a view we both share.

349
00:35:57,143 --> 00:35:58,683
The Queen is a mother to the people

350
00:35:58,773 --> 00:36:00,893
which is why
one cannot make a hasty decision.

351
00:36:01,483 --> 00:36:02,483
For that reason,

352
00:36:03,693 --> 00:36:05,063
I will seek advice from another.

353
00:36:05,733 --> 00:36:07,443
Whose advice would it be?

354
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:10,033
Chief Scholar
of the Office of Special Advisors.

355
00:36:10,653 --> 00:36:12,863
I requested a joint opinion
of the Three Offices.

356
00:36:17,373 --> 00:36:19,123
Why must it be the Chief Scholar?

357
00:36:19,703 --> 00:36:22,623
He is someone
not even Councilor Park can cajole.

358
00:36:26,923 --> 00:36:28,293
<i>Are you sure</i>

359
00:36:28,383 --> 00:36:30,803
that not even Councilor Park
can persuade Chief Scholar?

360
00:36:31,303 --> 00:36:32,343
Absolutely.

361
00:36:33,173 --> 00:36:35,473
So set your worries aside and wait.

362
00:36:44,443 --> 00:36:45,273
Your Majesty.

363
00:36:45,353 --> 00:36:48,523
Here is the joint opinion
of the Three Offices as ordered.

364
00:36:49,443 --> 00:36:50,693
Do speak.

365
00:36:51,483 --> 00:36:52,823
This selection of the queen…

366
00:36:53,863 --> 00:36:55,243
must be canceled.

367
00:36:58,453 --> 00:37:00,583
We are in the process
of making a decision.

368
00:37:00,993 --> 00:37:03,623
-Why do you say so?
-Your Majesty,

369
00:37:03,713 --> 00:37:07,543
it has not even been three years
since the late Queen passed away.

370
00:37:08,133 --> 00:37:10,383
A hasty selection of a new queen

371
00:37:10,463 --> 00:37:13,723
is not the proper way
to honor your marriage.

372
00:37:14,303 --> 00:37:16,013
Also, it is custom

373
00:37:16,093 --> 00:37:18,433
for the Queen to be from
a less privileged noble family.

374
00:37:18,513 --> 00:37:20,303
But those who attended the third screening

375
00:37:20,393 --> 00:37:22,433
were all from noble families
rich with power.

376
00:37:22,523 --> 00:37:25,313
It being an unfair process
is the second reason.

377
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:28,863
The result of that being
a possible power shift to her family

378
00:37:29,563 --> 00:37:32,023
is the third reason.

379
00:37:32,653 --> 00:37:34,193
We advise you to cancel the selection

380
00:37:34,283 --> 00:37:36,033
and follow custom.

381
00:37:36,113 --> 00:37:37,913
-We advise you to cancel the selection
-We advise you to cancel the selection

382
00:37:37,993 --> 00:37:40,323
-and follow custom.
-and follow custom.

383
00:37:43,163 --> 00:37:45,913
He took issue with the three-year
mourning period not being over?

384
00:37:46,963 --> 00:37:48,673
Are the Three Offices out of their minds?

385
00:37:49,043 --> 00:37:51,593
No king has ever stayed unmarried
for that long.

386
00:37:51,673 --> 00:37:54,883
The matter has taken
an odd twist of turns.

387
00:37:57,593 --> 00:37:59,343
Did Councilor Park say anything?

388
00:37:59,433 --> 00:38:01,763
He is deeply concerned of the fact

389
00:38:01,853 --> 00:38:03,773
that His Majesty is trying to buy time.

390
00:38:03,853 --> 00:38:05,483
Buy time?

391
00:38:06,563 --> 00:38:08,523
-What for?
-By any chance,

392
00:38:09,103 --> 00:38:11,443
if Minister of War's daughter
bears a child--

393
00:38:11,523 --> 00:38:15,073
His Majesty is without a child,
so a boy would become the prince.

394
00:38:17,653 --> 00:38:20,493
He dare show his disdain for me this way.

395
00:38:21,073 --> 00:38:22,623
To the King's Palace!

396
00:38:26,953 --> 00:38:28,003
Your Majesty,

397
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:30,003
The Queen Dowager has expressed her rage

398
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:34,053
and has requested the process
to be quickly finalized.

399
00:38:37,423 --> 00:38:38,343
Your Majesty,

400
00:38:38,423 --> 00:38:42,393
the Three Offices are
pressing unreasonable values.

401
00:38:42,473 --> 00:38:43,763
Customs cannot take priority

402
00:38:43,853 --> 00:38:45,933
when there is no heir to the throne.

403
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:49,443
Please consider
the weight and priority of the matter.

404
00:38:49,523 --> 00:38:52,363
Canceling a selection process in motion
is unprecedented.

405
00:38:52,443 --> 00:38:55,233
Your Majesty, please take
the Queen Dowager's advice to heart

406
00:38:55,323 --> 00:38:56,533
and choose Maiden Park.

407
00:38:56,613 --> 00:38:59,453
His Majesty has already voiced
his fondness of another,

408
00:38:59,533 --> 00:39:01,613
so why must he only consider
the Queen Dowager's words?

409
00:39:01,703 --> 00:39:02,993
-Such disloyalty!
-Then,

410
00:39:03,073 --> 00:39:05,623
are you suggesting
he disobey his own mother?

411
00:39:05,703 --> 00:39:06,873
Enough!

412
00:39:11,543 --> 00:39:15,043
The selection of a queen
is the event of the century.

413
00:39:17,053 --> 00:39:19,173
One cannot make a hasty decision.

414
00:39:19,883 --> 00:39:21,013
That is why

415
00:39:21,093 --> 00:39:23,803
you will stay in assembly

416
00:39:24,473 --> 00:39:26,013
until we come to a judgment.

417
00:39:40,323 --> 00:39:43,413
I have told you numerous times
that His Majesty is not the same.

418
00:39:43,493 --> 00:39:46,783
You believed I was clouded
by my hatred for late Queen Inyoung.

419
00:39:47,623 --> 00:39:48,793
I apologize.

420
00:39:51,663 --> 00:39:54,003
Why is His Majesty
prolonging his decision?

421
00:39:56,463 --> 00:40:00,303
Probably to have the officials yield.

422
00:40:15,063 --> 00:40:17,443
Your Majesty, it has been three days.

423
00:40:18,023 --> 00:40:21,533
Never has the selection of a spouse
been delayed for so long.

424
00:40:21,613 --> 00:40:25,823
The maidens have also been waiting
in the palace for days.

425
00:40:25,913 --> 00:40:27,873
Chief Scholar, do speak.

426
00:40:27,953 --> 00:40:30,083
Has there ever been a case

427
00:40:30,163 --> 00:40:32,753
where the Royal Court made candidates
wait and suffer for so long?

428
00:40:33,583 --> 00:40:35,003
There was not.

429
00:40:35,753 --> 00:40:38,793
However, this being
an unprecedented selection

430
00:40:38,883 --> 00:40:40,633
is also why it must be canceled.

431
00:40:41,923 --> 00:40:43,133
Goodness.

432
00:40:46,803 --> 00:40:47,803
I…

433
00:40:48,973 --> 00:40:51,023
have a proposal
that will satisfy everyone.

434
00:40:53,393 --> 00:40:55,653
It will not go against custom
as pointed out,

435
00:40:55,733 --> 00:40:57,903
nor will I be disobeying my mother.

436
00:40:57,983 --> 00:40:59,773
My reputation and dignity will be spared

437
00:41:01,693 --> 00:41:05,913
and an heir might be produced
as an outcome.

438
00:41:08,913 --> 00:41:10,163
Would you agree to it?

439
00:41:23,973 --> 00:41:26,803
Has a decision been made?

440
00:41:27,093 --> 00:41:28,223
Yes, my lady.

441
00:41:29,893 --> 00:41:31,563
Who is the chosen one?

442
00:41:32,353 --> 00:41:34,893
Yeonhee!

443
00:41:36,773 --> 00:41:39,403
Brother, what happened?

444
00:41:39,653 --> 00:41:41,403
You made it!

445
00:41:41,483 --> 00:41:43,443
Have I been selected?

446
00:41:43,693 --> 00:41:45,403
You made it!

447
00:42:58,233 --> 00:43:00,023
<i>Minister of War's in-law,
the Right State Councilor.</i>

448
00:43:01,693 --> 00:43:03,443
<i>His uncle, the Minister of Personnel.</i>

449
00:43:05,323 --> 00:43:06,483
<i>And Cho Sahyung.</i>

450
00:43:12,533 --> 00:43:13,573
Left State Councilor,

451
00:43:15,953 --> 00:43:17,413
the games begin.

452
00:43:34,513 --> 00:43:37,103
<i>Lady Park and Lady Cho</i>

453
00:43:37,773 --> 00:43:39,733
<i>are currently performing the wedding
by themselves.</i>

454
00:43:39,813 --> 00:43:41,733
DOKROIYEON:
WEDDING WHERE ONLY THE BRIDES ATTEND

455
00:43:50,283 --> 00:43:53,453
<i>I will take both Maid Cho
and Maid Park as my concubines.</i>

456
00:43:53,533 --> 00:43:55,623
<i>Once the three-year
mourning period is over,</i>

457
00:43:55,703 --> 00:43:59,253
<i>we will address this matter again</i>

458
00:43:59,913 --> 00:44:02,963
<i>and decide who is more eligible as Queen.</i>

459
00:44:06,883 --> 00:44:08,213
Taking them both as concubines.

460
00:44:09,093 --> 00:44:10,923
It is a bold move.

461
00:44:13,513 --> 00:44:15,893
Do you think it went as planned?

462
00:44:18,013 --> 00:44:19,063
Yes,

463
00:44:19,973 --> 00:44:21,433
I do.

464
00:44:22,273 --> 00:44:23,693
You have made a big mistake.

465
00:44:24,693 --> 00:44:27,573
His Majesty always wanted
to join forces with you,

466
00:44:27,653 --> 00:44:31,283
but it was never to share
his power and authority.

467
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:36,573
As a sword is most terrifying
when it remains sheathed.

468
00:44:38,163 --> 00:44:39,993
What are you saying?

469
00:44:40,623 --> 00:44:43,083
That you were also deceived
by His Majesty.

470
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:47,463
He will not easily let anyone

471
00:44:48,713 --> 00:44:51,343
take control of the Queen's Palace.

472
00:44:58,803 --> 00:45:02,023
His Majesty enters!

473
00:45:56,903 --> 00:45:59,413
<i>Not particularly benevolent,
but dauntless.</i>

474
00:45:59,743 --> 00:46:01,783
<i>Not wise, but cunning.</i>

475
00:46:01,993 --> 00:46:04,953
<i>Not virtuous, but highly patient.</i>

476
00:46:05,333 --> 00:46:08,673
<i>I guess one may say that
they are the makings of a king as well.</i>

477
00:47:21,063 --> 00:47:22,813
You possess striking dignity.

478
00:47:22,893 --> 00:47:23,983
The splendor I see…

479
00:47:24,853 --> 00:47:26,853
makes me realize
you were born to be Queen.

480
00:47:27,693 --> 00:47:29,863
What's so impressive
about being a concubine?

481
00:47:30,733 --> 00:47:31,693
I am still only a lady.

482
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,823
But I wanted to bow
at the Royal Ancestral Shrine.

483
00:47:34,903 --> 00:47:36,783
The only women allowed there

484
00:47:36,863 --> 00:47:39,123
are the queens and crown princesses
on their wedding day.

485
00:47:40,283 --> 00:47:43,583
But I had to wed His Majesty
all by myself without him present.

486
00:47:44,083 --> 00:47:45,923
Once you are crowned as Queen,

487
00:47:46,293 --> 00:47:48,923
you will be able to do
everything as you please.

488
00:47:49,593 --> 00:47:51,003
You are the one he adores.

489
00:47:52,713 --> 00:47:53,713
Right.

490
00:47:54,723 --> 00:47:58,393
His Majesty is… quite fond of me.

491
00:48:00,473 --> 00:48:03,773
Is the Office of Astrology
under Left State Councilor's influence?

492
00:48:04,433 --> 00:48:05,943
May I ask why you inquire?

493
00:48:06,023 --> 00:48:08,313
Because it decides
the night for consummation.

494
00:48:09,363 --> 00:48:13,783
If His Majesty beds Lady Park first…

495
00:48:14,403 --> 00:48:16,283
The Office of Astrology

496
00:48:17,493 --> 00:48:18,863
will have them consummate first.

497
00:48:19,573 --> 00:48:20,533
Father!

498
00:48:20,623 --> 00:48:21,783
I will not let that happen!

499
00:48:21,873 --> 00:48:24,833
We may both be concubines,
but I do not intend to share him with her.

500
00:48:25,703 --> 00:48:28,583
Of course. Please do not worry.

501
00:48:29,463 --> 00:48:32,253
His Majesty's hatred for Councilor Park
runs cold and deep.

502
00:48:32,343 --> 00:48:33,753
He will not grant her his affection.

503
00:48:36,053 --> 00:48:39,393
All you have to do is sit back and watch.

504
00:48:43,013 --> 00:48:44,223
Good night, my lord.

505
00:48:45,353 --> 00:48:46,893
Please take good care of Lady Cho.

506
00:48:47,523 --> 00:48:48,773
Do not fret.

507
00:48:51,653 --> 00:48:55,733
I will be of service to her
as if my life depended on it.

508
00:48:59,613 --> 00:49:00,953
You of all people?

509
00:49:01,993 --> 00:49:03,373
That is quite unexpected.

510
00:49:04,203 --> 00:49:06,753
His Majesty's affection heads her way.

511
00:49:07,293 --> 00:49:09,753
How could I not care for her
in every way I can?

512
00:49:10,833 --> 00:49:12,923
As His Majesty's loyal subject,

513
00:49:13,003 --> 00:49:15,803
I will serve the lady whom he loves.

514
00:49:18,093 --> 00:49:19,343
I will hold you to that.

515
00:50:37,383 --> 00:50:41,883
His Majesty will insist
on keeping you at arm's length.

516
00:50:42,473 --> 00:50:45,473
He will not even agree to a consummation.

517
00:50:46,103 --> 00:50:49,143
You must be someone His Majesty detests

518
00:50:50,273 --> 00:50:53,853
for him to knowingly mistreat me
just for being your niece.

519
00:50:54,903 --> 00:50:55,903
Yes.

520
00:50:56,153 --> 00:51:01,323
He even declared
never to see my niece's face.

521
00:51:03,073 --> 00:51:04,113
That is why

522
00:51:04,203 --> 00:51:08,703
you must do whatever you can to meet him.

523
00:51:10,663 --> 00:51:12,333
No matter what I do,

524
00:51:14,543 --> 00:51:15,793
will my people…

525
00:51:17,003 --> 00:51:18,383
be safe?

526
00:51:26,093 --> 00:51:27,723
Promise me at least that.

527
00:51:33,063 --> 00:51:34,313
That I promise.

528
00:51:37,153 --> 00:51:40,073
Then I will do whatever it takes
to be in his presence,

529
00:51:41,023 --> 00:51:42,233
Uncle.

530
00:51:55,543 --> 00:51:57,423
Why did it have to be me?

531
00:52:00,133 --> 00:52:01,553
There are more than enough women

532
00:52:01,633 --> 00:52:04,173
who would put their lives on the line
to be your niece.

533
00:52:06,683 --> 00:52:10,433
What you ask is something
that intrigues me too.

534
00:52:11,513 --> 00:52:15,483
Why you, you ask? Why must it be you?

535
00:52:19,653 --> 00:52:21,363
We will soon find out.

536
00:52:50,683 --> 00:52:52,553
What am I reading?

537
00:52:54,643 --> 00:52:57,483
All crafters were arrested…

538
00:52:58,983 --> 00:53:00,983
as ordered by the State Council?

539
00:53:01,063 --> 00:53:02,653
You must tread cautiously.

540
00:53:02,733 --> 00:53:06,743
If someone in the Royal Court
knows about Lady Jung and pursues her…

541
00:53:07,283 --> 00:53:09,073
Is it Councilor Park you suspect?

542
00:53:09,153 --> 00:53:10,703
Yes, Your Majesty.

543
00:53:14,873 --> 00:53:16,163
Your Majesty,

544
00:53:16,253 --> 00:53:18,663
The Office of Astrology sends word.

545
00:53:18,753 --> 00:53:19,963
Relay the message!

546
00:53:30,303 --> 00:53:34,183
The Office of Astrology says you are
to consummate with Lady Park tonight.

547
00:53:40,063 --> 00:53:43,773
Should I inform Lady Park that
you will soon make way to her chambers?

548
00:54:17,723 --> 00:54:18,683
Who am I speaking to?

549
00:54:19,273 --> 00:54:22,063
Please talk down to me as you outrank me.

550
00:54:22,853 --> 00:54:26,573
I am Court Lady Choi,
your lady-in-waiting.

551
00:54:29,483 --> 00:54:31,323
Are you here to monitor me?

552
00:54:32,403 --> 00:54:33,953
I am afraid

553
00:54:35,323 --> 00:54:36,413
I do not follow.

554
00:54:38,333 --> 00:54:39,873
His Majesty will see you tonight,

555
00:54:40,453 --> 00:54:42,083
so allow us to freshen you up.

556
00:54:43,463 --> 00:54:45,333
How do you guarantee that?

557
00:54:45,793 --> 00:54:47,963
He may see Lady Cho tonight.

558
00:54:48,843 --> 00:54:51,343
It is you whom he will see tonight.

559
00:54:57,183 --> 00:54:58,973
I see that the Left State Councilor

560
00:55:00,433 --> 00:55:02,273
has people within
the Office of Astrology too.

561
00:55:04,563 --> 00:55:07,153
Lady Park, I have word
from the King's Palace.

562
00:55:19,533 --> 00:55:20,583
Your Majesty,

563
00:55:21,753 --> 00:55:24,003
why are you disobeying
the consummation date?

564
00:55:24,793 --> 00:55:27,583
It is a day that even my father ignored.

565
00:55:29,713 --> 00:55:31,633
There is precedent.

566
00:55:34,553 --> 00:55:36,433
I will make my way to Lady Cho tonight.

567
00:55:42,183 --> 00:55:43,433
My apologies,

568
00:55:44,353 --> 00:55:46,563
but His Majesty will not come tonight.

569
00:55:48,653 --> 00:55:50,113
Why not?

570
00:55:51,443 --> 00:55:54,493
He is making his way
to Lady Cho's chambers…

571
00:55:58,533 --> 00:56:01,743
Please do not fret though, Lady Park.

572
00:56:02,453 --> 00:56:07,083
I have served His Majesty since his days
at the Crown Prince's Palace.

573
00:56:07,713 --> 00:56:11,593
Please put your faith in me

574
00:56:12,053 --> 00:56:15,723
and behave accordingly with grace.

575
00:56:16,883 --> 00:56:19,093
The Office of Astrology must have told him

576
00:56:19,183 --> 00:56:21,183
to consummate with me tonight.

577
00:56:21,813 --> 00:56:24,813
That is true, but His Majesty--

578
00:56:24,893 --> 00:56:27,443
Then tell him to adhere to custom and law.

579
00:56:28,233 --> 00:56:30,363
No woman shall be robbed
of her consummation night.

580
00:56:34,993 --> 00:56:37,073
The palace has its own set of rules.

581
00:56:37,703 --> 00:56:39,453
Maybe you should consider my loyal advice.

582
00:56:40,283 --> 00:56:43,083
It is a single night out of many to come.

583
00:56:43,453 --> 00:56:46,963
Please graciously allow
this night to Lady Cho and--

584
00:56:47,043 --> 00:56:48,753
You talk too much.

585
00:56:50,633 --> 00:56:53,923
Is being a eunuch a reason
for your talkative

586
00:56:54,923 --> 00:56:56,923
and ignorant behavior?

587
00:57:04,683 --> 00:57:06,733
I will relay your message word for word.

588
00:57:22,073 --> 00:57:23,703
Councilor Park must be getting old.

589
00:57:24,743 --> 00:57:26,703
His choice was to send that immature girl?

590
00:57:32,883 --> 00:57:35,003
That was highly inappropriate behavior.

591
00:57:35,593 --> 00:57:39,093
The Left State Councilor ordered
that I do anything I could

592
00:57:39,173 --> 00:57:40,683
to see his Majesty tonight.

593
00:57:44,013 --> 00:57:46,103
I am only doing as told by my uncle.

594
00:58:00,533 --> 00:58:01,533
Your Majesty,

595
00:58:01,613 --> 00:58:05,283
Lady Park has requested
that you adhere to the custom

596
00:58:05,373 --> 00:58:06,913
of the consummation date.

597
00:58:07,993 --> 00:58:09,253
Adhere…

598
00:58:10,833 --> 00:58:12,123
to custom?

599
00:58:12,463 --> 00:58:15,293
She only speaks
while unaware of palace rules.

600
00:58:16,343 --> 00:58:18,053
Please do not take it to heart.

601
00:58:21,343 --> 00:58:23,843
Councilor Park has sent
a questionable woman my way.

602
00:58:23,933 --> 00:58:27,143
Send Eunuch Jung to relay my words.

603
00:58:29,523 --> 00:58:30,983
Yes, Your Majesty.

604
00:58:41,653 --> 00:58:42,823
Lady Park,

605
00:58:42,903 --> 00:58:46,323
His Majesty has sent Eunuch Jung
to relay his order.

606
00:58:46,663 --> 00:58:49,123
Another eunuch? There is nothing to hear.

607
00:58:49,203 --> 00:58:51,123
The father of the people

608
00:58:51,203 --> 00:58:53,793
must not think lightly
of rules and customs.

609
00:58:57,883 --> 00:59:00,053
Relay my message back to His Majesty.

610
00:59:00,133 --> 00:59:02,173
If he will not come to my chambers,

611
00:59:03,683 --> 00:59:06,393
I will head to Lady Cho's myself.

612
00:59:11,853 --> 00:59:13,693
You look beautiful tonight.

613
00:59:15,063 --> 00:59:17,233
His Majesty will be here soon.

614
00:59:27,033 --> 00:59:28,493
If I do not show,

615
00:59:28,583 --> 00:59:30,793
she will make her way
to Lady Cho's chambers?

616
00:59:31,083 --> 00:59:31,953
Yes, Your Majesty.

617
00:59:33,913 --> 00:59:35,003
Chief Eunuch.

618
00:59:37,793 --> 00:59:39,213
Yes, Your Majesty.

619
00:59:39,793 --> 00:59:43,383
What are your thoughts
on Lady Park's behavior?

620
00:59:44,553 --> 00:59:46,593
Forgive me for saying this,

621
00:59:48,933 --> 00:59:50,853
but it seems like jealousy.

622
00:59:51,393 --> 00:59:54,433
Showing jealousy on her first night
which is grounds for deposal?

623
01:00:01,233 --> 01:00:05,073
<i>I am giving Your Majesty justification
to oust the Left State Councilor's niece.</i>

624
01:00:07,283 --> 01:00:09,703
<i>So, please come and remove me from court.</i>

625
01:00:12,413 --> 01:00:14,253
<i>I will receive any punishment gladly…</i>

626
01:00:15,663 --> 01:00:17,333
<i>if it means I can leave the palace.</i>

627
01:00:18,503 --> 01:00:20,003
<i>Arrogant as she may be,</i>

628
01:00:21,673 --> 01:00:23,513
I feel nothing but gratitude.

629
01:00:24,553 --> 01:00:26,933
She hurriedly desires to be deposed,

630
01:00:27,013 --> 01:00:28,893
so who am I to ignore her wishes?

631
01:00:30,603 --> 01:00:32,473
I will head to Lady Park's chambers.

632
01:00:55,793 --> 01:00:58,673
<i>You told me that
this game is of your design.</i>

633
01:01:07,803 --> 01:01:09,513
<i>I am impressed.</i>

634
01:01:10,593 --> 01:01:13,303
<i>You came out swinging
and made a clever move.</i>

635
01:01:32,163 --> 01:01:34,493
Lady Park, His Majesty shall enter.

636
01:01:36,413 --> 01:01:39,663
I am here as requested!
Let me see that face of yours.

637
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:09,403
I present my ultimate move

638
01:02:10,243 --> 01:02:11,363
that you…

639
01:02:12,203 --> 01:02:14,163
set up to be played.

640
01:03:00,453 --> 01:03:03,463
BLOODY HEART

641
01:03:10,999 --> 01:03:17,832
Translated by Hye-lim Park

642
01:03:25,103 --> 01:03:28,273
You were the Crown Prince all along?

643
01:03:28,363 --> 01:03:31,363
<i>It is a token of my loyalty.</i>

644
01:03:31,443 --> 01:03:32,743
