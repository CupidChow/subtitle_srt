BLOODY HEART

2
00:00:46,258 --> 00:00:49,178
THE PEOPLE, GROUPS, PLACES, AND INCIDENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE PURELY FICTIONAL

3
00:00:50,978 --> 00:00:52,268
How do you know that,

4
00:00:53,518 --> 00:00:55,148
Lady Park?

5
00:00:59,318 --> 00:01:00,528
I…

6
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:05,448
am the daughter of Yoo Haksoo.
The late deposed Crown Princess.

7
00:01:07,658 --> 00:01:08,948
I am Lady Yoo.

8
00:01:26,388 --> 00:01:28,138
Look here, Lady Park…

9
00:01:30,468 --> 00:01:33,478
Are you truly aware

10
00:01:35,308 --> 00:01:37,398
of what you are saying?

11
00:01:39,938 --> 00:01:42,188
You wish for my words to be false.

12
00:01:42,278 --> 00:01:43,358
More accurately,

13
00:01:44,778 --> 00:01:47,448
you wish to make it a false statement.

14
00:01:50,328 --> 00:01:52,698
Do not waste your time, Councilor.

15
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:55,668
You will be very…

16
00:01:56,998 --> 00:01:58,168
busy from now on.

17
00:01:58,248 --> 00:02:00,038
-Please grant your royal permission
-Please grant your royal permission

18
00:02:00,168 --> 00:02:02,628

21

26
00:02:23,608 --> 00:02:24,738
Your Majesty.

27
00:02:25,568 --> 00:02:27,068
Please set a consummate date.

28
00:02:34,118 --> 00:02:36,248
A wife's family interfering
with Internal Court business

29
00:02:37,498 --> 00:02:38,748
is highly frowned upon.

30
00:02:38,828 --> 00:02:39,748
Your Majesty!

31
00:02:41,038 --> 00:02:43,088
I am your loyal subject.

32
00:02:43,628 --> 00:02:44,668
Please…

33
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:47,548
allow me to die as one

34
00:02:49,218 --> 00:02:51,008
by awarding me your benevolence.

35
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:09,448
Eunuch, come forth.

36
00:03:12,868 --> 00:03:14,408
Yes, Your Majesty?

37
00:03:14,868 --> 00:03:16,448
Set a date in the near future

38
00:03:17,328 --> 00:03:19,208
for my consummation with Lady Cho.

39
00:03:19,288 --> 00:03:20,748
Yes, Your Majesty.

40
00:03:31,798 --> 00:03:33,638
I am humbled by your generosity,

41
00:03:34,928 --> 00:03:36,138
Your Majesty.

42
00:03:52,368 --> 00:03:54,908
BLOODY HEART
EPISODE 8

43
00:03:55,578 --> 00:03:58,078
We have word from
Bamboo Grove Village's governor.

44
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,638
Lady Park's origin seems suspicious.

45
00:04:18,718 --> 00:04:20,058
The fact that

46
00:04:21,058 --> 00:04:23,188
someone of the royal court
visited her so far away--

47
00:04:23,268 --> 00:04:25,398
His Majesty's heart beats for her.

48
00:04:26,148 --> 00:04:28,688
He must have sent a eunuch
to frequently check on her well-being.

49
00:04:28,778 --> 00:04:31,028
But it goes back seven years.

50
00:04:31,778 --> 00:04:34,868
And at that time, he was the Crown Prince.

51
00:04:35,278 --> 00:04:36,448
It is of no great deal.

52
00:04:41,538 --> 00:04:43,418
Do you remember Yoo Haksoo's daughter

53
00:04:43,828 --> 00:04:46,288
who was selected as Crown Princess?

54
00:04:48,498 --> 00:04:49,588
Yes.

55
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,798
What was she like?

56
00:04:52,378 --> 00:04:55,298
She was rumored to be an eccentric soul.

57
00:04:56,048 --> 00:04:57,598
However, she was well-educated

58
00:04:57,678 --> 00:04:59,388
and was knowledgeable in various matters.

59
00:05:00,428 --> 00:05:01,518
Of course.

60
00:05:02,308 --> 00:05:04,018
Her father did lament

61
00:05:04,098 --> 00:05:06,858
that if she had been born a boy,

62
00:05:07,818 --> 00:05:11,988
she would have easily become
a minister or someone of that value.

63
00:05:26,998 --> 00:05:30,668
Have the painter
draw a portrait of Eunuch Jung.

64
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:33,338
Once it is done,
take it to Bamboo Grove Village.

65
00:05:33,628 --> 00:05:35,508
Personally confirm

66
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:41,428
that the eunuch who visited
Bamboo Grove Village is Eunuch Jung.

67
00:05:42,098 --> 00:05:43,978
There is no time to waste.

68
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:46,268
Yes, my lord.

69
00:05:48,268 --> 00:05:50,518
How nice it is for you all
to pull me out of my boredom.

70
00:05:50,608 --> 00:05:52,898
I am overwhelmed with gratitude.

71
00:05:54,238 --> 00:05:55,948
-The gratitude is ours.
-The gratitude is ours.

72
00:05:56,988 --> 00:06:00,078
The palace is where you reside,
Your Highness.

73
00:06:00,158 --> 00:06:02,538
Any discomfort, as small as it may be,

74
00:06:02,618 --> 00:06:04,658
will be our delight to accommodate.

75
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:08,578
Of course. His Majesty will soon approve
of the crowning of the Queen

76
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,918
which will pave the way for your return.

77
00:06:12,918 --> 00:06:15,298
Her Highness is here
to recuperate from her illness.

78
00:06:15,588 --> 00:06:18,548
I am appalled by your irrelevant remark.

79
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:22,558
Your Highness,

80
00:06:22,638 --> 00:06:25,308
I humbly request that you be at ease.

81
00:06:25,888 --> 00:06:27,938
We hope our heartfelt prayers

82
00:06:28,018 --> 00:06:30,148
will help reclaim your health.

83
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:34,358
Madame Yoon, your words

84
00:06:35,318 --> 00:06:37,198
are nothing but kind.

85
00:06:54,298 --> 00:06:56,338
It has been a while, cousin.

86
00:06:57,048 --> 00:06:58,758
Why did you call for me?

87
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:07,938
OKDANG

88
00:07:08,018 --> 00:07:10,348
Funeral customs have been ignored
since the deposed King,

89
00:07:12,518 --> 00:07:15,648
and now you wish for His Majesty
to disobey the three-year mourning period!

90
00:07:16,238 --> 00:07:18,398
You scoundrels.

91
00:07:24,738 --> 00:07:27,958
If you are also here to persuade me,
I suggest you turn around.

92
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:29,418
How could I not be aware

93
00:07:29,788 --> 00:07:32,838
of your wishes to uphold
the customs of Confucian ritualism?

94
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:34,498
All I worry

95
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:37,378
is that His Majesty
will be written in history

96
00:07:38,128 --> 00:07:40,298
as the leader
who ignored scholars' petitions.

97
00:07:41,258 --> 00:07:43,508
I cannot believe you are
using him to plead your case.

98
00:07:44,258 --> 00:07:47,018
You and His Majesty
might have to give in to the scholars,

99
00:07:48,058 --> 00:07:50,438
but there is a way for you
to still follow custom.

100
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:17,878
You are late.

101
00:08:18,378 --> 00:08:19,548
Is His Majesty

102
00:08:19,628 --> 00:08:22,968
also aware of whom your father was?

103
00:08:24,428 --> 00:08:27,888
Would he knowing
be more beneficial to you,

104
00:08:28,718 --> 00:08:29,728
or…

105
00:08:30,768 --> 00:08:32,688
would it be better for me to say

106
00:08:34,058 --> 00:08:36,728
that I seduced the oblivious King?

107
00:08:36,818 --> 00:08:38,938
As if it would make any difference.

108
00:08:39,028 --> 00:08:41,148
I will look into it either way.

109
00:08:41,238 --> 00:08:42,778
Of course.

110
00:08:44,908 --> 00:08:46,278
Seeing as you still have

111
00:08:46,368 --> 00:08:48,828
not reported a traitor's daughter
to the State Tribunal

112
00:08:49,448 --> 00:08:52,408
tells me that I am quite valuable to you.

113
00:08:53,038 --> 00:08:57,338
I will make my decision
based on your answer.

114
00:09:03,878 --> 00:09:04,928
I…

115
00:09:06,638 --> 00:09:08,258
will propose a deal.

116
00:09:17,648 --> 00:09:20,108
My people whom you are after

117
00:09:20,188 --> 00:09:22,068
and those you imprisoned.

118
00:09:24,318 --> 00:09:25,948
Could you let them go?

119
00:09:35,498 --> 00:09:39,498
In no way can this be a deal.

120
00:09:41,588 --> 00:09:45,588
You have only given me
more cards to utilize.

121
00:09:46,338 --> 00:09:48,548
Your obsession regarding their safety

122
00:09:48,638 --> 00:09:52,428
tells me that I should
never let them free.

123
00:09:53,308 --> 00:09:54,478
Then,

124
00:09:56,268 --> 00:09:57,728
will this continue?

125
00:09:57,808 --> 00:09:59,978
Nothing has changed between us.

126
00:10:08,448 --> 00:10:09,528
Actually,

127
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:12,998
everything has changed.

128
00:10:14,828 --> 00:10:17,578
I can rob you of your heart's true desire.

129
00:10:19,998 --> 00:10:22,418
It may be difficult
to be crowned as a queen,

130
00:10:23,758 --> 00:10:25,468
but not being crowned as one…

131
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:29,848
is more than simple.

132
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,348
Chief Scholar,

133
00:10:33,428 --> 00:10:35,768
are you here to request
that I crown the Queen?

134
00:10:35,848 --> 00:10:37,388
Of course not.

135
00:10:37,478 --> 00:10:41,768
How could I possibly ask you
to overturn the decision you made?

136
00:10:42,648 --> 00:10:44,568
The crowning ceremony

137
00:10:44,648 --> 00:10:47,948
should be held
after the three-year mourning period,

138
00:10:48,028 --> 00:10:52,118
but there will be no harm in deciding
which lady should be Queen

139
00:10:52,908 --> 00:10:55,078
so that she could attend to
Internal Court affairs.

140
00:10:55,158 --> 00:10:57,618
Your solution is nothing but temporary.

141
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,078
Would the royal court
and scholars approve?

142
00:11:00,168 --> 00:11:02,708
If you declare
that a decision will be made yourself

143
00:11:03,298 --> 00:11:06,418
by the end of this month
while the Queen Dowager recuperates,

144
00:11:07,088 --> 00:11:11,088
the officials and scholars
will have no grounds to disapprove.

145
00:11:11,888 --> 00:11:13,718
In the absence of the Queen Dowager,

146
00:11:14,888 --> 00:11:16,478
I am to make…

147
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:18,688
a unilateral decision?

148
00:11:19,938 --> 00:11:21,188
Yes, Your Majesty.

149
00:11:26,488 --> 00:11:27,818
Chief Scholar,

150
00:11:29,028 --> 00:11:31,278
you are the most loyal subject.

151
00:11:31,948 --> 00:11:33,578
I am humbled, Your Majesty.

152
00:11:35,288 --> 00:11:37,658
We are selecting the head lady
of the Internal Court.

153
00:11:38,658 --> 00:11:41,168
Will it be decided without the advice
of its highest ranking lady?

154
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:44,458
You are the one
who brought about this outcome.

155
00:11:46,168 --> 00:11:47,588
Look here, Lady Park.

156
00:11:48,338 --> 00:11:50,178
Is it truly your intention

157
00:11:51,638 --> 00:11:54,178
to give up the title to Lady Cho?

158
00:11:56,098 --> 00:11:58,178
You still do not understand
the depth of my words.

159
00:11:58,268 --> 00:12:00,268
I could easily

160
00:12:02,018 --> 00:12:04,268
kill all your people.

161
00:12:05,938 --> 00:12:07,028
Have you…

162
00:12:08,818 --> 00:12:11,358
forgotten that I am here as your niece?

163
00:12:14,448 --> 00:12:15,698
The actual process may differ,

164
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:19,078
but a gracious attitude
is what people find valuable in a Queen.

165
00:12:19,158 --> 00:12:20,868
Never have I seen a concubine

166
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:24,078
end up as Queen
after displaying arrogance.

167
00:12:28,168 --> 00:12:29,258
Our deal

168
00:12:30,008 --> 00:12:31,428
is over.

169
00:12:31,508 --> 00:12:32,798
From this moment on,

170
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:37,558
I will threaten you instead.

171
00:13:01,288 --> 00:13:03,668
Lady Park, what brings you
to the Royal Secretariat?

172
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,168
I am here to reprimand you,
Chief Royal Secretary.

173
00:13:06,748 --> 00:13:08,378
Worries cloud over His Majesty

174
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:10,758
which has led him
to stay away from my chambers.

175
00:13:12,338 --> 00:13:15,678
All I do as the chief royal secretary
is receive and relay his orders--

176
00:13:15,758 --> 00:13:18,428
Exactly. That is why I am here to see you.

177
00:13:20,768 --> 00:13:22,598
Maybe you should talk to his court lady.

178
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:23,808
I do not understand why--

179
00:13:23,888 --> 00:13:27,188
Your incompetence is why
he has not been to see me.

180
00:13:29,898 --> 00:13:30,858
That is enough.

181
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:37,068
You are all dismissed.

182
00:13:46,248 --> 00:13:47,958
How far are you willing to go?

183
00:13:48,038 --> 00:13:50,298
This is hardly anything
to be alarmed about.

184
00:13:50,918 --> 00:13:54,678
At this month's congratulatory ceremony,
I will barge into the hall

185
00:13:55,258 --> 00:13:57,718
and yell at His Majesty
in the presence of all officials

186
00:13:57,798 --> 00:14:01,808
demanding an answer as to why
he has not been to my chambers.

187
00:14:05,188 --> 00:14:07,478
Would that not be written in history?

188
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:10,608
Until the 8th of this month,

189
00:14:10,688 --> 00:14:13,438
bring me the governor
of Bamboo Grove Village.

190
00:14:16,778 --> 00:14:17,608
You have…

191
00:14:19,118 --> 00:14:20,488
until the 8th.

192
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:32,088
You have… my word.

193
00:14:41,808 --> 00:14:43,718
I am only here
to briefly chat with Mother.

194
00:14:43,888 --> 00:14:45,138
Do not make a fuss.

195
00:15:00,028 --> 00:15:01,528
You have done enough

196
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:04,408
to provoke the crowning of the Queen.

197
00:15:08,038 --> 00:15:09,998
Are you sure about this though?

198
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:12,168
Once the Queen gives birth to a son,

199
00:15:12,748 --> 00:15:16,418
the subjects will fear her more
and will tiptoe less around you.

200
00:15:19,758 --> 00:15:22,138
Rather than the King's stepmother,

201
00:15:22,218 --> 00:15:24,808
they will revere the prince's mother.

202
00:15:26,848 --> 00:15:28,728
You made a hasty move.

203
00:15:34,648 --> 00:15:37,528
Trying to drive a wedge
between us, are you?

204
00:15:37,608 --> 00:15:40,908
Having Joseon in the palm of his hands
is still not enough for Councilor Park.

205
00:15:43,028 --> 00:15:44,828
What will happen once he has control

206
00:15:44,908 --> 00:15:47,038
over the Queen and the son
she gives birth to?

207
00:15:49,498 --> 00:15:53,088
Do you expect him to still have your back?

208
00:15:56,298 --> 00:15:58,088
As your son,

209
00:15:58,168 --> 00:16:01,378
I only say this out of concern
of you losing the power you hold.

210
00:16:03,098 --> 00:16:04,638
I ask that you let your anger subside.

211
00:16:15,318 --> 00:16:17,278
I see you have yet to receive news.

212
00:16:18,318 --> 00:16:20,278
Since you are recuperating,

213
00:16:23,528 --> 00:16:24,658
I am solely to decide

214
00:16:25,698 --> 00:16:27,578
on who will be Queen.

215
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,458
That is preposterous.

216
00:16:31,038 --> 00:16:32,538
A mother-in-law cannot be excluded

217
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:35,248
from the selection process
of her daughter-in-law.

218
00:16:43,298 --> 00:16:44,138
Court Lady Han!

219
00:16:46,558 --> 00:16:48,388
Summon Councilor Park this instant.

220
00:16:48,768 --> 00:16:49,808
This instant!

221
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:55,978
It is my blunder
that has led to this commotion.

222
00:16:56,898 --> 00:17:00,568
The storm must be weathered,
and thus I will make a decision.

223
00:17:01,608 --> 00:17:03,528
The Three Offices claim
only what is dutiful

224
00:17:03,608 --> 00:17:05,658
which is why I will continue
to mourn the late Queen.

225
00:17:05,738 --> 00:17:08,738
The royal court and scholars claim
only what is correct as well

226
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:12,158
which is why I will decide on a Queen
and treat her with respect

227
00:17:12,248 --> 00:17:14,618
<i>as she manages business
of the Internal Court.</i>

228
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:17,088
<i>She will be crowned
after the three-year mourning period.</i>

229
00:17:17,168 --> 00:17:21,458
Thank you for your boundless generosity,
Your Majesty.

230
00:17:21,968 --> 00:17:25,798
-Thank you for your boundless generosity.
-Thank you for your boundless generosity.

231
00:17:26,848 --> 00:17:30,638
The Queen should not be selected
without the Queen Dowager's approval,

232
00:17:31,428 --> 00:17:32,978
but time is of the essence

233
00:17:33,978 --> 00:17:36,058
and this matter
cannot be held off any further.

234
00:17:36,808 --> 00:17:38,318
If the Queen Dowager remains unstable

235
00:17:38,398 --> 00:17:40,728
and does not return to the palace
by the end of this month,

236
00:17:41,318 --> 00:17:43,778
I will take advisement
from the royal family and officials

237
00:17:45,238 --> 00:17:47,028
to reach a decision.

238
00:18:16,598 --> 00:18:19,398
Father. It is your son, Namsang.

239
00:18:34,578 --> 00:18:35,868
What brings you by?

240
00:18:37,998 --> 00:18:40,208
I hear you have been troubled these days.

241
00:18:40,538 --> 00:18:42,248
Mother is deeply worried.

242
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,968
Is it due to Lady Park?

243
00:18:46,468 --> 00:18:49,718
Chief Royal Secretary
did say something disturbing,

244
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:52,058
but those groundless rumors
will soon subside,

245
00:18:52,138 --> 00:18:53,308
so please do not worry.

246
00:18:53,768 --> 00:18:57,438
Lady Park is not one
to behave that erratically.

247
00:18:57,518 --> 00:19:01,058
After all, it was her wisdom
that solved the issue with the scholars.

248
00:19:04,108 --> 00:19:05,318
It was you.

249
00:19:08,108 --> 00:19:09,488
It was you all along.

250
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:13,078
Of course.

251
00:19:13,158 --> 00:19:15,868
Even the Chief Scholar
would be open to your suggestion.

252
00:19:16,618 --> 00:19:17,618
So tell me.

253
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:21,578
Did you relay her proposal as ordered?

254
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,918
All while knowing

255
00:19:25,918 --> 00:19:29,128
that it could ruin our family's chances
of being related to the Queen?

256
00:19:29,928 --> 00:19:33,758
Who becomes Queen is to be decided
by the royal family and His Majesty.

257
00:19:33,848 --> 00:19:37,428
The Queen failing to give birth
to an heir of the mainline of descent

258
00:19:39,018 --> 00:19:40,598
has been the root of this madness.

259
00:19:41,188 --> 00:19:44,228
A son from the mainline of descent
must receive proper education

260
00:19:44,318 --> 00:19:46,688
in order to be a sage ruler.

261
00:19:46,778 --> 00:19:50,778
How are we supposed to serve a king
who is handed the throne

262
00:19:52,028 --> 00:19:53,738
out of sheer luck?

263
00:19:54,738 --> 00:19:58,038
So you coveted the power
of the future Crown Prince too?

264
00:19:58,748 --> 00:19:59,958
Your greed for that is excessive.

265
00:20:00,038 --> 00:20:05,168
I will be the one
who crowns the future King.

266
00:20:06,088 --> 00:20:09,918
Never will we be ruled by a tyrant again.

267
00:20:10,628 --> 00:20:12,388
That is not your duty.

268
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,258
That is my duty!

269
00:20:16,218 --> 00:20:18,848
Only I am capable of this.

270
00:20:18,928 --> 00:20:22,648
Why can you not see
that the arrogance you display

271
00:20:22,728 --> 00:20:25,858
makes you seem
like a power-hungry subject?

272
00:20:26,978 --> 00:20:28,068
You foolish boy!

273
00:20:32,158 --> 00:20:34,028
If I were power-hungry,

274
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:39,868
I would have already
taken over the Three Offices!

275
00:20:42,078 --> 00:20:43,538
Your incorruptible demeanor.

276
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,918
Do you actually believe
it is of your free will?

277
00:20:47,918 --> 00:20:48,958
It is not.

278
00:20:50,218 --> 00:20:51,968
It is what I allowed.

279
00:20:52,838 --> 00:20:53,758
It was I.

280
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:56,808
It was I who allowed it!

281
00:21:00,728 --> 00:21:03,138
If your King were a tyrant,

282
00:21:12,488 --> 00:21:14,608
you would have taken
a much different path.

283
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:17,698
A much different path.

284
00:21:29,668 --> 00:21:31,208
You summoned me, my lord?

285
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:33,428
Out of the servants,

286
00:21:34,178 --> 00:21:37,178
single out two
who do not have mouths or ears.

287
00:21:38,098 --> 00:21:41,018
-Yes, my lord.
-And also find a fixer.

288
00:21:41,888 --> 00:21:43,388
Once the deed is over,

289
00:21:44,348 --> 00:21:46,398
their mouths must remain shut.

290
00:22:08,538 --> 00:22:11,248
To pray for Queen Dowager's recovery
at a temple,

291
00:22:11,378 --> 00:22:13,378
I wish to step outside the palace.

292
00:22:13,548 --> 00:22:15,928
I humbly request that you allow it.

293
00:22:17,138 --> 00:22:18,428
Tell me why

294
00:22:19,678 --> 00:22:21,178
you truly wish to leave the palace.

295
00:22:27,058 --> 00:22:29,438
It seems as though
the crafters are in Hanyang.

296
00:22:29,518 --> 00:22:33,528
I am hoping to get
a glimpse of them somehow.

297
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:37,908
Is that really the reason?

298
00:22:38,868 --> 00:22:42,038
Why would there be another one?

299
00:22:43,908 --> 00:22:44,948
I do not know.

300
00:22:46,828 --> 00:22:49,128
You have never been easy to read,

301
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:52,878
but it has become impossible nowadays.

302
00:22:56,758 --> 00:22:58,378
The palace guards will escort you.

303
00:22:59,338 --> 00:23:01,428
Return straight away
after delivering your prayer.

304
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:07,348
Are you…

305
00:23:08,098 --> 00:23:10,098
that concerned about me?

306
00:23:15,528 --> 00:23:16,648
Forgive my jest.

307
00:23:25,998 --> 00:23:27,078
I have always…

308
00:23:29,248 --> 00:23:30,828
worried about you.

309
00:23:41,928 --> 00:23:44,138
I will make sure to return safely.

310
00:23:44,808 --> 00:23:46,308
When is the date?

311
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:50,688
When is the date, my lord?

312
00:23:51,648 --> 00:23:52,768
This month…

313
00:23:53,358 --> 00:23:56,148
This month, on the 8th.

314
00:23:56,728 --> 00:23:57,938
…on the 8th.

315
00:24:28,018 --> 00:24:31,438
<i>Kill the male servant
once the deed is done.</i>

316
00:24:33,728 --> 00:24:35,648
<i>It is a slow-acting poison.</i>

317
00:24:36,318 --> 00:24:39,738
<i>Bear witness to Lady Park drinking the tea
and returning to the palace afterward.</i>

318
00:25:16,438 --> 00:25:18,898
-Tell Lord Park immediately.
-Of course.

319
00:26:25,338 --> 00:26:27,588
It sure is nice to escape the narrow walls

320
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:30,098
and breathe fresh air.

321
00:26:30,848 --> 00:26:34,388
I hope to escort you outside
more often from now on.

322
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:39,038
Councilor Park?

323
00:27:40,878 --> 00:27:43,668
Councilor Park!
Bring us cold water. This instant!

324
00:27:47,838 --> 00:27:50,128
You came out of nowhere and now this?

325
00:27:50,588 --> 00:27:51,678
I thought you could not come.

326
00:27:52,718 --> 00:27:54,718
Did you know I would be here?

327
00:27:56,218 --> 00:27:57,058
I…

328
00:27:57,768 --> 00:27:59,138
informed her.

329
00:28:05,978 --> 00:28:09,318
For what reason are you at this temple?

330
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:11,158
Lady Park suggested

331
00:28:11,238 --> 00:28:13,948
that a Buddhist prayer
fighting off my nightmares

332
00:28:14,908 --> 00:28:17,498
would offer a good excuse
for my return to the palace.

333
00:28:48,648 --> 00:28:50,988
There is something between
Councilor Park and Lady Park…

334
00:28:53,608 --> 00:28:55,828
that I am clearly not aware of.

335
00:29:01,788 --> 00:29:04,748
CHEONWANGMUN

336
00:29:07,418 --> 00:29:09,708
I knew you had another idea in mind

337
00:29:09,798 --> 00:29:13,628
when you agreed to bring me
the governor on such short notice.

338
00:29:14,638 --> 00:29:16,678
But this is a move I saw miles ahead.

339
00:29:17,178 --> 00:29:19,678
You were willing to kill me
and give up having the Queen's powers.

340
00:29:20,098 --> 00:29:22,018
I must clearly be a threat to you.

341
00:29:24,148 --> 00:29:26,188
The poison in today's tea.

342
00:29:27,318 --> 00:29:29,568
Is it the same poison
consumed by the late Queen Inyoung?

343
00:29:30,438 --> 00:29:32,448
I had the most to gain

344
00:29:33,198 --> 00:29:36,658
if the late Queen were deposed.

345
00:29:36,738 --> 00:29:40,658
However, she was poisoned to death

346
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,498
and things took the worst turn…

347
00:29:45,538 --> 00:29:46,538
for me.

348
00:29:49,918 --> 00:29:50,758
I will

349
00:29:51,338 --> 00:29:54,628
let your people free.

350
00:29:56,048 --> 00:29:57,088
Will that…

351
00:30:01,518 --> 00:30:02,768
put an end to this?

352
00:30:08,608 --> 00:30:09,688
No.

353
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:13,948
I no longer trust your words.

354
00:30:14,028 --> 00:30:15,398
I will do what I can

355
00:30:15,658 --> 00:30:19,028
to provide His Majesty with the tool
that will allow him to seal your fate.

356
00:30:19,698 --> 00:30:23,618
That is how I will save my people.

357
00:30:28,498 --> 00:30:33,458
No one in this country
could ever have the power…

358
00:30:39,048 --> 00:30:40,598
to decide whether I live or die.

359
00:30:41,848 --> 00:30:42,888
You are wrong.

360
00:30:44,098 --> 00:30:46,228
Anyone can possess that power.

361
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:52,688
I entered the palace
with no way to retreat.

362
00:30:53,358 --> 00:30:54,438
It is why

363
00:30:55,398 --> 00:30:57,068
I can make whatever move I want.

364
00:31:14,168 --> 00:31:15,378
Forgive my tardiness.

365
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:16,718
I am ashamed, Your Majesty.

366
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:20,388
The Queen Dowager has yet to arrive,
so you are not late.

367
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:01,388
Pressure the shaman
for a consummation date.

368
00:32:04,388 --> 00:32:06,428
It is the birth date
of a high-ranking nobleman.

369
00:32:06,768 --> 00:32:08,638
Do you see a son in his future?

370
00:32:16,358 --> 00:32:19,528
GYEONGSHIN YEAR, EULCHUK MONTH,
GABO DAY, MYO HOUR

371
00:32:20,488 --> 00:32:21,948
I see a son in his future.

372
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:25,578
Then tell me the date
of when he will be conceived.

373
00:32:26,788 --> 00:32:28,868
Who is it that seeks this date?

374
00:32:30,038 --> 00:32:31,668
The nobleman's mother.

375
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:36,748
Looking at this,
the nobleman's mother is deceased.

376
00:32:37,878 --> 00:32:39,378
She must be his stepmother.

377
00:32:40,968 --> 00:32:45,258
Do you recognize
whom was born on this date?

378
00:33:03,318 --> 00:33:04,908
The date must have been requested…

379
00:33:07,078 --> 00:33:08,408
by the Queen Dowager.

380
00:33:10,198 --> 00:33:11,288
That's right.

381
00:33:12,538 --> 00:33:14,628
Allow me to meet her in person.

382
00:33:15,328 --> 00:33:18,048
Of course not.
What you are asking is preposterous.

383
00:33:21,338 --> 00:33:25,258
The son conceived on the consummation date
will be the Crown Prince.

384
00:33:26,468 --> 00:33:28,218
I would not dare to have it relayed.

385
00:33:32,018 --> 00:33:32,848
What?

386
00:33:34,518 --> 00:33:36,938
Did you request
that I allow a monk to enter the palace?

387
00:33:37,018 --> 00:33:41,278
He possesses great power of premonition,
Your Highness.

388
00:33:41,898 --> 00:33:44,778
Someone with such great power
must be aware of the outcome

389
00:33:44,858 --> 00:33:46,868
should he enter the palace.

390
00:33:47,578 --> 00:33:49,488
The royal court and scholars
will be in an uproar.

391
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:53,908
He claims that the Crown Prince
will be conceived on said date.

392
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:58,338
Such a sacred date
cannot be relayed via my lowly words.

393
00:33:58,418 --> 00:34:02,418
It is why he wishes
to inform you in person.

394
00:34:06,928 --> 00:34:08,928
Speak to me…

395
00:34:10,308 --> 00:34:11,848
of this great power he possesses.

396
00:34:30,118 --> 00:34:31,618
-My goodness!
-Uncle Ma!

397
00:34:32,788 --> 00:34:34,288
Get in here. Hurry.

398
00:34:37,828 --> 00:34:39,458
Master Lim!

399
00:34:39,788 --> 00:34:41,798
-Master Lim!
-Goodness me.

400
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:44,168
This is not how one should behave.
Let me see you.

401
00:34:46,758 --> 00:34:49,348
I do not remember you being this gaunt.

402
00:34:49,888 --> 00:34:51,258
I lost sleep worrying about you.

403
00:34:51,678 --> 00:34:53,308
Just a second.

404
00:34:54,978 --> 00:34:57,598
This. Miss gave it to me.

405
00:34:58,768 --> 00:35:02,108
I told her to bring anything she could
from Lady Jeong.

406
00:35:02,188 --> 00:35:03,358
-Is that it?
-Yes.

407
00:35:20,828 --> 00:35:24,668
Was it Eunuch Jung
who visited Bamboo Grove Village?

408
00:35:26,048 --> 00:35:27,508
<i>I never saw his face.</i>

409
00:35:28,548 --> 00:35:32,218
But… there is something I did see.

410
00:35:59,078 --> 00:36:01,378
<i>Miss called him a swordsman.</i>

411
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:05,458
<i>It must not be a nickname
considering the big gash on him.</i>

412
00:36:20,598 --> 00:36:21,688
It was you.

413
00:36:22,268 --> 00:36:24,478
You took her to Jeolla to keep her hidden.

414
00:36:26,858 --> 00:36:28,148
Chief Eunuch.

415
00:36:28,238 --> 00:36:30,488
Eunuch Jung will be leaving office.

416
00:36:30,568 --> 00:36:32,068
Have it be that way.

417
00:36:32,738 --> 00:36:33,988
Yes, my lord.

418
00:36:38,538 --> 00:36:41,668
Eunuch Jung did not report for duty today?

419
00:36:41,748 --> 00:36:45,838
No, my lady. He also left
in a hurry last night due to a fever.

420
00:36:47,048 --> 00:36:50,508
Eunuch Jung recuperates from his fever
at his home outside the palace?

421
00:36:59,638 --> 00:37:03,098
It is right around the time I expected.

422
00:37:07,108 --> 00:37:08,068
I see.

423
00:37:08,148 --> 00:37:10,318
You can find it way over there.

424
00:37:10,398 --> 00:37:12,648
-That is right.
-Goodness.

425
00:37:20,498 --> 00:37:23,668
POLICE BUREAU

426
00:37:54,568 --> 00:37:57,318
You are to answer my questions truthfully.

427
00:37:59,368 --> 00:38:00,698
Was it you?

428
00:38:02,038 --> 00:38:04,958
Did you save the life
of traitor Yoo Haksoo's daughter?

429
00:38:06,078 --> 00:38:09,458
Someone placed a dead body
pretending to be hers,

430
00:38:09,548 --> 00:38:11,128
lit it on fire,

431
00:38:12,008 --> 00:38:15,258
and brought a guilty prisoner to safety.

432
00:38:15,338 --> 00:38:16,678
Was it you?

433
00:38:19,388 --> 00:38:20,718
Speak!

434
00:38:25,018 --> 00:38:26,098
Yes.

435
00:38:29,228 --> 00:38:31,228
It was my doing.

436
00:38:31,818 --> 00:38:33,358
By whose orders?

437
00:38:34,448 --> 00:38:36,198
The late King?

438
00:38:36,988 --> 00:38:38,028
Or…

439
00:38:43,158 --> 00:38:45,368
His Majesty?

440
00:38:59,428 --> 00:39:02,718
How far are you willing
to go for His Majesty?

441
00:39:05,808 --> 00:39:08,518
May I ask what provokes such an inquiry?

442
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:11,358
Allow me to rephrase.

443
00:39:13,228 --> 00:39:14,528
What is it

444
00:39:15,988 --> 00:39:19,358
that you truly wish to do
for His Majesty's sake?

445
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:42,888
What are you playing at?

446
00:39:47,728 --> 00:39:50,308
It has been a while, my lord.

447
00:39:50,398 --> 00:39:52,018
You will make a report

448
00:39:52,898 --> 00:39:54,648
to the Police Bureau?

449
00:39:56,028 --> 00:39:58,068
How dare you.

450
00:39:58,148 --> 00:39:59,488
By the looks of it,

451
00:40:01,108 --> 00:40:03,618
you seem to know what I am here to report.

452
00:40:50,158 --> 00:40:51,458
Chief Eunuch,

453
00:40:52,038 --> 00:40:53,458
give us privacy.

454
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:02,968
No one is allowed to enter.

455
00:41:03,798 --> 00:41:04,848
Yes, my lord.

456
00:41:06,388 --> 00:41:07,428
Your Majesty,

457
00:41:08,388 --> 00:41:10,388
Left State Councilor
is here for an audience.

458
00:41:18,148 --> 00:41:20,898
Councilor Park has made his way
to His Majesty's chambers.

459
00:41:55,518 --> 00:41:56,728
Your Majesty,

460
00:41:58,188 --> 00:42:00,228
the daughter of traitor Yoo Haksoo…

461
00:42:01,858 --> 00:42:03,278
still lives.

462
00:42:08,778 --> 00:42:10,118
Your Majesty!

463
00:42:11,118 --> 00:42:14,458
Why did you save
the daughter of a traitor?

464
00:42:15,918 --> 00:42:17,748
Even if the late King ordered it,

465
00:42:19,288 --> 00:42:23,168
you should not have complied!

466
00:42:26,928 --> 00:42:28,178
And now…

467
00:42:29,678 --> 00:42:33,848
I am choosing to rectify the error
of this despicable incident.

468
00:42:33,928 --> 00:42:37,728
The one who had a traitor's daughter
submitted in the Queen selection process

469
00:42:39,478 --> 00:42:40,728
is you.

470
00:42:51,788 --> 00:42:53,078
It is why

471
00:42:54,618 --> 00:42:56,708
I will punish Lady Park

472
00:42:57,958 --> 00:43:00,168
and also pay the price

473
00:43:01,918 --> 00:43:03,838
for my misconduct.

474
00:43:21,148 --> 00:43:22,978
I must speak to His Majesty.
Announce my arrival.

475
00:43:23,568 --> 00:43:26,398
The Left State Councilor
is here for an audience.

476
00:43:26,858 --> 00:43:28,448
As they converse privately--

477
00:43:28,528 --> 00:43:31,158
Your Majesty, it is Lady Park.

478
00:43:31,238 --> 00:43:34,078
I wish to make a report
regarding the Left State Councilor.

479
00:43:40,748 --> 00:43:41,958
Your Majesty,

480
00:43:42,038 --> 00:43:43,998
please allow me to enter.

481
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:47,588
Let her enter!

482
00:44:37,558 --> 00:44:41,478
I requested an audience
to make a truthful report.

483
00:44:45,068 --> 00:44:46,228
I…

484
00:44:46,978 --> 00:44:49,108
am the former Crown Princess

485
00:44:49,188 --> 00:44:51,068
and the daughter

486
00:44:52,658 --> 00:44:53,908
of traitor Yoo Haksoo.

487
00:44:56,908 --> 00:44:57,788
Lady Park…

488
00:44:57,868 --> 00:45:00,038
The world believes
that I was burned to ashes--

489
00:45:00,118 --> 00:45:02,868
-Enough!
-But someone broke me out of prison

490
00:45:02,958 --> 00:45:05,288
and escorted me
to Bamboo Grove Village. He is…

491
00:45:06,288 --> 00:45:07,958
-Lady Park…
-That is enough!

492
00:45:08,708 --> 00:45:10,468
It is Left State Councilor Park.

493
00:45:16,758 --> 00:45:18,308
Councilor Park deceived the world

494
00:45:18,388 --> 00:45:20,228
and saved the life
of a traitor's daughter.

495
00:45:20,308 --> 00:45:23,268
He then had her become
a royal concubine as his niece.

496
00:45:24,518 --> 00:45:26,228
He deceived you, violated the law,

497
00:45:26,308 --> 00:45:28,528
and humiliated the royal family
which is an act of treason.

498
00:45:29,108 --> 00:45:30,688
Turn me into the State Tribunal

499
00:45:30,778 --> 00:45:33,488
so that the whole truth can be proved.

500
00:45:43,458 --> 00:45:44,288
Your Majesty,

501
00:45:46,288 --> 00:45:48,418
how long are you willing to put up…

502
00:45:56,678 --> 00:45:58,428
with this nonsense?

503
00:45:58,508 --> 00:46:00,678
Councilor Park is already aware
of this matter.

504
00:46:04,638 --> 00:46:05,768
Your Majesty,

505
00:46:05,848 --> 00:46:07,978
turn me into the State Tribunal.

506
00:46:08,058 --> 00:46:09,818
The one who broke me free

507
00:46:10,528 --> 00:46:12,938
and escorted me
to Bamboo Grove Village will testify.

508
00:46:13,028 --> 00:46:15,068
I received the order…

509
00:46:18,448 --> 00:46:21,408
from the Left State Councilor
at the time which was you.

510
00:46:21,998 --> 00:46:23,458
You ordered me

511
00:46:23,538 --> 00:46:25,998
to save the life
of traitor Yoo Haksoo's daughter.

512
00:46:26,078 --> 00:46:28,998
The one who helped me take refuge
in Bamboo Grove Village will also testify.

513
00:46:29,088 --> 00:46:30,458
It was you, Lord Park.

514
00:46:30,548 --> 00:46:33,548
You asked me to keep
the traitor's daughter safely hidden

515
00:46:35,008 --> 00:46:36,588
so that you could make her Queen

516
00:46:36,678 --> 00:46:38,548
after adopting her as your niece.

517
00:46:38,638 --> 00:46:40,718
And then I,

518
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:42,678
traitor Yoo's daughter,

519
00:46:43,728 --> 00:46:45,308
will attest to that fact.

520
00:46:49,358 --> 00:46:50,568
Lady Park…

521
00:46:52,478 --> 00:46:53,858
If you do,

522
00:46:55,398 --> 00:46:56,778
you will lose your life.

523
00:46:59,738 --> 00:47:01,028
Your Majesty,

524
00:47:01,698 --> 00:47:04,498
you accepted me as Lord Park's niece
in order to spare my life,

525
00:47:04,578 --> 00:47:05,868
but the tables have turned.

526
00:47:06,748 --> 00:47:08,418
I might lose my life,

527
00:47:10,038 --> 00:47:12,338
but Councilor Park can also be executed.

528
00:47:25,478 --> 00:47:29,308
In this confidential letter,
all of our crimes have been listed.

529
00:47:30,858 --> 00:47:32,648
Should any of us three die…

530
00:47:32,728 --> 00:47:33,818
No,

531
00:47:34,568 --> 00:47:36,438
even if all of us should die,

532
00:47:38,528 --> 00:47:40,738
this letter will give you enough reason

533
00:47:41,948 --> 00:47:43,198
to ruin

534
00:47:44,238 --> 00:47:46,958
Councilor Park and his family.

535
00:48:50,518 --> 00:48:51,598
Are you truly…

536
00:48:54,518 --> 00:48:56,728
choosing to die for this cause?

537
00:49:02,658 --> 00:49:04,198
Please do not do this.

538
00:49:06,828 --> 00:49:08,158
You have done enough…

539
00:49:11,498 --> 00:49:14,038
to discourage Councilor Park.

540
00:49:15,458 --> 00:49:17,958
You will be granted
what you have been fighting for,

541
00:49:19,298 --> 00:49:21,048
so please end this right now.

542
00:49:25,258 --> 00:49:27,098
You must.

543
00:49:30,558 --> 00:49:32,848
I once wished to live as well.

544
00:49:34,518 --> 00:49:35,938
But then it occurred to me

545
00:49:37,858 --> 00:49:41,238
that I had no option
but running away like I once did.

546
00:49:42,398 --> 00:49:44,448
Then that is what you shall do.

547
00:49:44,528 --> 00:49:46,278
I did not want to run away

548
00:49:46,988 --> 00:49:49,948
and live out my life as a living corpse.

549
00:49:51,328 --> 00:49:52,828
Embracing death

550
00:49:53,708 --> 00:49:55,128
revealed a new path for me.

551
00:49:57,588 --> 00:49:59,338
A path to save my people…

552
00:50:01,918 --> 00:50:04,548
and to accomplish your objective.

553
00:50:06,848 --> 00:50:08,678
Rather than a living corpse,

554
00:50:09,558 --> 00:50:10,768
I choose to die

555
00:50:12,098 --> 00:50:14,348
and live within the hearts…

556
00:50:20,978 --> 00:50:22,818
of my people.

557
00:50:24,238 --> 00:50:25,358
Do you really…

558
00:50:27,948 --> 00:50:30,158
wish to die this way?

559
00:50:36,248 --> 00:50:37,168
Just

560
00:50:37,918 --> 00:50:39,838
promise me one thing.

561
00:50:39,918 --> 00:50:42,708
My people who are held hostage
at Bamboo Grove Village

562
00:50:43,548 --> 00:50:47,338
and those who are living on the run.
Allow them to live freely.

563
00:50:47,928 --> 00:50:49,718
Do not let any more innocents

564
00:50:49,798 --> 00:50:53,428
lose their lives
at the cost of a political war.

565
00:50:53,848 --> 00:50:55,308
Do not let…

566
00:50:59,438 --> 00:51:03,778
hundreds of scholars cease to breathe
in the same way my parents did.

567
00:51:14,788 --> 00:51:15,788
Please…

568
00:51:16,828 --> 00:51:18,578
become a wise and benevolent king.

569
00:51:21,708 --> 00:51:23,298
Then I will gladly

570
00:51:25,008 --> 00:51:28,048
drag the Left State Councilor
down to hell with me.

571
00:52:05,668 --> 00:52:07,048
Thank you.

572
00:52:08,508 --> 00:52:10,548
I am truly grateful.

573
00:52:12,298 --> 00:52:13,468
You are…

574
00:52:16,518 --> 00:52:18,638
the most loyal subject.

575
00:52:22,518 --> 00:52:25,898
Your sacrifice will pave the way
for royal authority…

576
00:52:27,818 --> 00:52:29,358
to be strengthened.

577
00:52:31,488 --> 00:52:33,028
The degradation my father faced

578
00:52:34,578 --> 00:52:36,158
and the blood my mother shed…

579
00:52:41,418 --> 00:52:43,628
formed the crown that sits on my head.

580
00:52:45,298 --> 00:52:47,628
A single drop of blood shed from you…

581
00:52:49,758 --> 00:52:51,718
would make no difference.

582
00:52:56,388 --> 00:52:57,558
You…

583
00:52:59,558 --> 00:53:01,598
will die alongside Councilor Park.

584
00:53:02,148 --> 00:53:03,308
And I…

585
00:53:05,058 --> 00:53:06,318
will rise

586
00:53:08,068 --> 00:53:10,238
as Joseon's true King.

587
00:54:16,388 --> 00:54:17,758
Has Joseon

588
00:54:19,008 --> 00:54:21,428
ever seen a ruler

589
00:54:22,888 --> 00:54:24,768
quite like her?

590
00:54:26,978 --> 00:54:31,318
A ruler who is willing
to sacrifice one's own life…

591
00:54:33,568 --> 00:54:35,358
to save the people?

592
00:55:00,258 --> 00:55:02,268
Your Majesty,
it has been reported that tomorrow is

593
00:55:02,348 --> 00:55:03,928
an auspicious day for you and Lady Cho.

594
00:55:05,728 --> 00:55:08,228
If you have another date in mind…

595
00:55:09,648 --> 00:55:11,268
There is no need to postpone.

596
00:55:15,608 --> 00:55:16,948
Proceed…

597
00:55:20,448 --> 00:55:21,698
as announced.

598
00:55:28,578 --> 00:55:31,668
I hope there will not be an issue
with our consummation tomorrow.

599
00:55:31,998 --> 00:55:33,548
I hardly doubt it.

600
00:55:34,048 --> 00:55:35,798
I only speak out of concern.

601
00:55:36,168 --> 00:55:37,428
The day before our consummation,

602
00:55:37,508 --> 00:55:39,928
a royal relative dies or thunder strikes.

603
00:55:40,008 --> 00:55:42,428
His Majesty will not use such an affair
as an excuse this time.

604
00:55:42,968 --> 00:55:46,558
Father notified me
that he strong-armed His Majesty…

605
00:55:49,098 --> 00:55:50,268
What…

606
00:55:51,938 --> 00:55:54,068
did you just say?

607
00:56:00,278 --> 00:56:01,698
I hear you urgently summoned me.

608
00:56:02,238 --> 00:56:05,748
Did you pressure His Majesty into settling
on a consummation date with me?

609
00:56:08,208 --> 00:56:09,788
But why?

610
00:56:09,868 --> 00:56:12,838
Why would you bother him
with a frivolous matter?

611
00:56:15,248 --> 00:56:17,628
-Lady Cho--
-I am unlike his former concubines.

612
00:56:18,258 --> 00:56:21,468
His Majesty chose me out of love.

613
00:56:24,008 --> 00:56:25,928
I do not approve of your interference.

614
00:56:26,428 --> 00:56:29,478
I will request that
the consummation be pushed back.

615
00:56:30,438 --> 00:56:32,808
His Majesty knew Lady Park
since her days outside the palace.

616
00:56:33,058 --> 00:56:34,648
It could be her…

617
00:56:35,938 --> 00:56:37,358
that he truly desires.

618
00:56:40,658 --> 00:56:43,158
Who he finds fitting
will be crowned as Queen,

619
00:56:43,778 --> 00:56:45,538
so cease those childish thoughts.

620
00:56:45,618 --> 00:56:46,788
Our family's fate

621
00:56:47,948 --> 00:56:49,708
lies in your hands.

622
00:56:57,668 --> 00:56:59,718
The woman that he truly desires…

623
00:57:01,838 --> 00:57:03,798
could be Lady Park?

624
00:57:33,288 --> 00:57:34,828
She is the Queen Dowager.

625
00:57:35,378 --> 00:57:36,838
Show respect.

626
00:57:45,798 --> 00:57:47,598
Relay the consummation date.

627
00:57:51,598 --> 00:57:54,898
I am much obliged, but there is
something I must confirm first.

628
00:57:55,098 --> 00:57:56,188
What?

629
00:57:56,518 --> 00:57:58,728
Is the conception
of His Majesty's eldest son

630
00:58:00,478 --> 00:58:02,108
what you truly desire?

631
00:58:02,188 --> 00:58:05,318
Such insolence.
How dare you speak to her this way?

632
00:58:05,408 --> 00:58:06,408
Court Lady Han.

633
00:58:26,048 --> 00:58:28,888
Are you suggesting
that I desire something else?

634
00:58:35,518 --> 00:58:38,898
I have yet to foresee
what it is you desire.

635
00:58:39,898 --> 00:58:40,728
However,

636
00:58:41,438 --> 00:58:42,938
a son conceived on this date

637
00:58:44,278 --> 00:58:46,948
will possess the utmost power
and authority in Joseon.

638
00:58:52,288 --> 00:58:54,078
Is that what you truly desire?

639
00:59:22,478 --> 00:59:23,858
His Majesty enters.

640
00:59:58,938 --> 00:59:59,898
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

641
01:00:01,108 --> 01:00:02,938
Carry on your path.

642
01:00:04,478 --> 01:00:06,738
I will do what I must.

643
01:00:25,088 --> 01:00:26,338
The full moon is in sight.

644
01:00:28,298 --> 01:00:29,718
You should head back.

645
01:00:30,468 --> 01:00:31,718
His Majesty…

646
01:00:33,548 --> 01:00:35,638
must be with Lady Cho by now.

647
01:00:37,978 --> 01:00:39,518
The air is chilly.

648
01:00:40,688 --> 01:00:41,808
Truth be told,

649
01:00:45,018 --> 01:00:46,978
I wanted him to stop him from going.

650
01:00:50,238 --> 01:00:52,278
I also wanted to fully resent him.

651
01:00:53,568 --> 01:00:55,198
But I could not.

652
01:00:59,118 --> 01:01:01,828
Not when I still remember
how he told me to live…

653
01:01:04,538 --> 01:01:06,998
while shedding tears that I could not.

654
01:01:08,458 --> 01:01:10,798
Forgive me but I do not follow.

655
01:01:13,928 --> 01:01:15,598
I wish to be alone for a while.

656
01:01:17,718 --> 01:01:18,808
Please.

657
01:02:28,668 --> 01:02:29,838
I apologize.

658
01:02:39,638 --> 01:02:40,678
Your Majesty!

659
01:02:43,138 --> 01:02:43,978
Your Majesty!

660
01:03:25,808 --> 01:03:27,388
Where is Lady Park?

661
01:04:11,978 --> 01:04:13,728
<i>Tonight, I will allow you to embrace me.</i>

662
01:04:37,168 --> 01:04:40,178
BLOODY HEART
