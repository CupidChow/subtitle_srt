BLOODY HEART

2
00:00:46,258 --> 00:00:49,178
THE PEOPLE, GROUPS, PLACES, AND INCIDENTS
IN THIS DRAMA ARE PURELY FICTIONAL

3
00:00:51,728 --> 00:00:52,888
Are you saying…

4
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,728
you would rather be my enemy?

5
00:01:00,898 --> 00:01:02,898
When you of all people

6
00:01:04,448 --> 00:01:06,568
are aware of how my life has been?

7
00:01:09,238 --> 00:01:11,248
When I am finally close to strengthening

8
00:01:12,618 --> 00:01:13,868
the royal authority--

9
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:15,788
There will be no end to it.

10
00:01:18,498 --> 00:01:19,998
That is why I chose this path.

11
00:01:20,628 --> 00:01:21,668
No.

12
00:01:23,298 --> 00:01:25,088
No, you are to stop.

13
00:01:26,508 --> 00:01:27,888
You must stop.

14
00:01:31,178 --> 00:01:32,768
If you choose to stand against me,

15
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:36,978
I will…

16
00:01:42,108 --> 00:01:44,028
have to eliminate you.

17
00:01:54,038 --> 00:01:56,368
I wanted power desperately

18
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:58,918
only to protect you.

19
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:05,758
I did not want to lose my wife in vain
just as my late father did.

20
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:08,218
I shall

21
00:02:09,298 --> 00:02:13,308
continue on my path.
It is the only way to protect you.

22
00:02:20,268 --> 00:02:22,068
Please do so, Your Majesty.

23
00:02:23,568 --> 00:02:25,028
Go down your own path.

24
00:02:26,398 --> 00:02:27,448
However,

25
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:32,618
take that journey for yourself,
and not for my sake.

26
00:02:35,408 --> 00:02:36,618
I will

27
00:02:38,288 --> 00:02:40,498
protect myself.

28
00:02:42,998 --> 00:02:44,708
I will protect myself…

29
00:02:47,128 --> 00:02:48,508
with everything I have.

30
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:16,868
BLOODY HEART
FINAL EPISODE

31
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,708
What do you mean?

32
00:03:23,788 --> 00:03:26,208
The consort is Yoo Haksoo's daughter,
the deposed crown princess?

33
00:03:26,298 --> 00:03:27,508
That is correct.

34
00:03:28,588 --> 00:03:30,338
What will happen to Councilor Park

35
00:03:30,428 --> 00:03:31,548
if that is true?

36
00:03:32,428 --> 00:03:34,558
His crime is too dire.

37
00:03:47,028 --> 00:03:49,778
Why did you make such a foolish choice?

38
00:03:52,108 --> 00:03:54,448
If I didn't shake around
His Majesty's design,

39
00:03:54,528 --> 00:03:56,538
all members of Sarim and the Royal Court

40
00:03:56,618 --> 00:03:58,998
would have been pushed around by him.

41
00:03:59,078 --> 00:04:01,288
I do not know
what your deal with the consort was,

42
00:04:02,248 --> 00:04:03,458
but you'll regret this.

43
00:04:03,538 --> 00:04:08,208
I think through every choice I make
so that I do not regret anything.

44
00:04:20,518 --> 00:04:22,898
Respectfully escort him
to the State Tribunal.

45
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:24,148
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

46
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:04,768
What did I want to do with power?

47
00:05:06,768 --> 00:05:07,728
Nothing.

48
00:05:10,858 --> 00:05:12,528
I only hoped to protect.

49
00:05:15,108 --> 00:05:18,658
The one thing that made
the ones I missed return and visit

50
00:05:20,658 --> 00:05:21,658
was power.

51
00:05:29,088 --> 00:05:30,248
Let us go.

52
00:05:49,518 --> 00:05:52,318
Your Highness. And also Mother.

53
00:05:52,398 --> 00:05:54,358
How could you do something this serious?

54
00:05:55,698 --> 00:05:56,738
I have no excuses.

55
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:00,278
You shouldn't dare to rebuke the consort.

56
00:06:00,868 --> 00:06:03,248
This is something your father and I did.

57
00:06:03,328 --> 00:06:04,158
Mother.

58
00:06:06,078 --> 00:06:07,878
My lord has kept his promise.

59
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:09,668
It's now your turn.

60
00:06:10,878 --> 00:06:13,008
You must keep your promise
to keep our family

61
00:06:13,508 --> 00:06:15,088
and Councilor Park safe.

62
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:18,468
I shall do that.

63
00:06:19,138 --> 00:06:20,598
I will trust your words.

64
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,878
The consort was the former crown princess?

65
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,128
What does that mean?

66
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,748
You must calm down, Lady Cho.

67
00:06:52,838 --> 00:06:55,048
She had committed such a grave crime.

68
00:06:55,378 --> 00:06:57,338
Why won't you discuss her punishment?

69
00:06:57,418 --> 00:06:58,878
Didn't I tell you?

70
00:06:59,468 --> 00:07:01,348
Even His Majesty turned a blind eye to it.

71
00:07:01,428 --> 00:07:02,348
Father.

72
00:07:02,428 --> 00:07:04,308
We cannot bring down the consort.

73
00:07:04,388 --> 00:07:06,268
But Councilor Park is over.

74
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:10,268
Stay low.

75
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:13,608
You are to be the queen,
but you have not been installed yet.

76
00:07:13,688 --> 00:07:15,228
And His Majesty is

77
00:07:15,688 --> 00:07:18,068
capable of deposing you
even after you become one.

78
00:07:20,408 --> 00:07:21,448
Aren't you happy?

79
00:07:22,528 --> 00:07:23,828
I'm scared.

80
00:07:24,488 --> 00:07:28,578
Father and Brother.
Do you wish for me to become queen?

81
00:07:35,338 --> 00:07:36,878
You can only survive in the palace

82
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,258
only if you have
His Majesty's favor or power.

83
00:07:40,298 --> 00:07:43,388
What I'm the most afraid of
is that you might end up

84
00:07:45,138 --> 00:07:46,768
growing old all alone.

85
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:13,498
The consort is afraid
I'll take the path of the deposed king

86
00:08:14,288 --> 00:08:15,588
and his queen.

87
00:08:16,548 --> 00:08:17,418
Do you

88
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,088
also believe I'll walk down that path?

89
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:22,298
No matter which path you take,

90
00:08:22,888 --> 00:08:24,968
the path you choose is the right one.

91
00:08:26,508 --> 00:08:27,558
You are

92
00:08:29,178 --> 00:08:31,058
always stronger than me.

93
00:08:31,638 --> 00:08:34,648
I am nothing but a lowly man.

94
00:08:36,608 --> 00:08:39,028
This lowly servant was
taken in and taught to be useful,

95
00:08:40,238 --> 00:08:43,568
then I was freed from my servanthood
and acknowledged

96
00:08:43,658 --> 00:08:44,818
only by the late King.

97
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:47,488
And the late King said

98
00:08:48,158 --> 00:08:50,868
I was the only one he could trust.

99
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,168
He asked me to look after you.

100
00:08:57,418 --> 00:08:59,508
I have seen the humiliation
of the late King,

101
00:08:59,588 --> 00:09:02,378
and I saw
the devastating death of his queen.

102
00:09:04,338 --> 00:09:07,258
I cannot let you go in misery too.

103
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:11,178
Please do not waver.

104
00:09:16,648 --> 00:09:18,188
Call in the Three Offices.

105
00:09:18,268 --> 00:09:21,858
The least I can do… is warn her.

106
00:09:23,528 --> 00:09:25,488
My father is Scholar Yoo Haksoo,

107
00:09:25,568 --> 00:09:27,658
and I am his daughter.

108
00:09:28,528 --> 00:09:31,078
My father and I have
our foundation in the Sarim.

109
00:09:31,788 --> 00:09:35,168
I am one with all of you.

110
00:09:36,418 --> 00:09:39,798
Therefore, please join me.

111
00:09:40,378 --> 00:09:41,918
We shall do that.

112
00:09:42,008 --> 00:09:44,048
We were unfairly framed
and banished to the wild,

113
00:09:44,428 --> 00:09:47,468
unable to even breathe at ease
as criminals.

114
00:09:47,548 --> 00:09:49,848
Yes, you were chased down as a traitor,

115
00:09:49,928 --> 00:09:51,888
then you came to this place all alone.

116
00:09:52,468 --> 00:09:54,438
We will do everything in our power

117
00:09:54,768 --> 00:09:56,688
to make you the queen
and your son, the prince.

118
00:09:57,398 --> 00:09:58,608
Thank you.

119
00:09:58,688 --> 00:10:00,728
-Thank you for your grace.
-Thank you for your grace.

120
00:10:00,818 --> 00:10:02,648
-Consort Yoo.
-Consort Yoo.

121
00:10:02,738 --> 00:10:06,988
For this issue, please join forces
with the meritorious subjects.

122
00:10:08,238 --> 00:10:10,448
I promised Councilor Park
that I will reduce his sentence

123
00:10:10,948 --> 00:10:14,538
in return
for taking my true identity back.

124
00:10:20,248 --> 00:10:21,168
Your Majesty.

125
00:10:21,248 --> 00:10:24,758
The consort's social status
shakes the foundation of this nation.

126
00:10:24,838 --> 00:10:26,178
We cannot condone this.

127
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:28,588
Councilor Park confessed everything
as his fault.

128
00:10:28,678 --> 00:10:30,428
Why do you blame the consort?

129
00:10:30,508 --> 00:10:34,268
So should we not hold her responsible
for deceiving her superiors?

130
00:10:34,348 --> 00:10:36,558
His Majesty condoned this
and took a part in this.

131
00:10:37,228 --> 00:10:40,148
If you wish to hold her responsible,
hold His Majesty responsible first.

132
00:10:40,228 --> 00:10:42,148
Then first, we must hold
the late King responsible

133
00:10:42,228 --> 00:10:43,478
for letting the consort live.

134
00:10:43,568 --> 00:10:45,358
And punishing the late King?

135
00:10:45,438 --> 00:10:46,818
That is unprecedented!

136
00:10:54,368 --> 00:10:55,578
What should I do?

137
00:10:56,158 --> 00:10:57,748
Should I punish myself?

138
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:01,378
Or should I punish
the former King, my father?

139
00:11:01,838 --> 00:11:04,798
Your Majesty, please do not say that.

140
00:11:04,878 --> 00:11:08,758
We cannot discuss this issue anymore.

141
00:11:10,928 --> 00:11:13,308
But how astounding is this?

142
00:11:14,308 --> 00:11:17,178
The subjects and the Sarim are enemies,
yet you two stand together.

143
00:11:20,438 --> 00:11:23,148
Councilor Park Gyewon is
the one who caused everything.

144
00:11:24,068 --> 00:11:25,688
He'll be held responsible.

145
00:11:37,368 --> 00:11:39,408
Father. It is I, your son.

146
00:11:40,248 --> 00:11:41,168
Come in.

147
00:12:41,558 --> 00:12:44,148
Your Highness!

148
00:12:44,228 --> 00:12:46,608
Please spare my life, Your Highness.

149
00:12:47,358 --> 00:12:49,358
-No!
-Your Highness.

150
00:12:49,438 --> 00:12:52,398
I received His Majesty's order to take Han
and have her interrogated.

151
00:12:52,988 --> 00:12:53,818
Take her away.

152
00:12:53,908 --> 00:12:55,948
Your Highness.

153
00:12:56,028 --> 00:12:58,198
Your Highness.

154
00:12:59,118 --> 00:13:02,288
The King must be trying to annihilate
everyone who's on my side.

155
00:13:02,368 --> 00:13:03,288
Your Highness!

156
00:13:14,508 --> 00:13:16,298
I will meet the King myself

157
00:13:18,258 --> 00:13:20,638
and speak with him in person.

158
00:13:32,988 --> 00:13:35,988
THE KING'S QUARTERS

159
00:13:38,828 --> 00:13:40,538
I beg you, Your Majesty.

160
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:44,918
Please forgive your mother's sins.

161
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:00,178
Mother.

162
00:14:00,888 --> 00:14:02,428
Why are you doing this?

163
00:14:03,348 --> 00:14:06,598
If I dishonored you in any way,
please just lash me!

164
00:14:06,688 --> 00:14:08,268
I heard the royal office

165
00:14:08,358 --> 00:14:10,728
has been chaotic every single day
because of me.

166
00:14:10,818 --> 00:14:13,028
I wish to grovel and plead for your mercy.

167
00:14:13,938 --> 00:14:15,818
Your Majesty, you must abandon me

168
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:17,358
and show your majesty.

169
00:14:20,868 --> 00:14:22,328
That's enough.

170
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:27,208
You are most unsightly.

171
00:14:38,968 --> 00:14:41,638
Will your subjects kill me

172
00:14:42,808 --> 00:14:44,138
to save themselves?

173
00:14:44,768 --> 00:14:45,978
Or…

174
00:14:46,058 --> 00:14:47,138
will they begin a coup

175
00:14:47,228 --> 00:14:49,558
and dethrone an undutiful son like you?

176
00:14:52,318 --> 00:14:53,648
No matter which side it is,

177
00:14:55,398 --> 00:14:57,698
there won't be any justification.

178
00:15:01,578 --> 00:15:03,118
But if I hurt myself,

179
00:15:04,748 --> 00:15:07,658
their rebellion will be more justified.

180
00:15:14,338 --> 00:15:16,338
What must I do to apologize

181
00:15:17,218 --> 00:15:18,378
for my disobedience?

182
00:15:19,128 --> 00:15:21,928
Send me to the palace in Onyang
along with my court ladies.

183
00:15:28,058 --> 00:15:32,398
I no longer have any strength
to hold out in the palace.

184
00:15:36,738 --> 00:15:38,068
I will allow it,

185
00:15:41,068 --> 00:15:42,028
Mother.

186
00:16:35,538 --> 00:16:37,918
The palace is filled with people
who'll stab your back

187
00:16:38,508 --> 00:16:40,508
once you show them mercy.

188
00:16:42,508 --> 00:16:46,508
That is why I need someone
who will absolutely take my side.

189
00:16:49,928 --> 00:16:51,768
If they weren't with me,

190
00:16:52,808 --> 00:16:54,648
they were always against me.

191
00:16:55,558 --> 00:16:56,688
I will…

192
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:01,648
take your side and live with you

193
00:17:02,528 --> 00:17:04,278
until the end of my life.

194
00:17:11,748 --> 00:17:13,248
Then why are you doing this?

195
00:17:13,328 --> 00:17:15,498
Because I do not wish to lose you.

196
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:20,168
I am not your enemy, Your Majesty.

197
00:17:20,878 --> 00:17:23,088
I wish to be a subject
who gives you candid advice.

198
00:17:25,718 --> 00:17:26,968
Please accept me.

199
00:17:29,598 --> 00:17:31,058
You must accept me.

200
00:17:50,868 --> 00:17:53,118
The Queen Dowager is leaving today.

201
00:17:55,288 --> 00:17:56,208
Your Majesty.

202
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:59,788
I never expected the Sarim to collude

203
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:01,458
with the Royal Court.

204
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:04,008
If two enemies can work together,

205
00:18:04,088 --> 00:18:06,798
your subjects may work
with the Queen Dowager again.

206
00:18:08,928 --> 00:18:10,178
I know that.

207
00:18:12,638 --> 00:18:14,888
The Queen Dowager
will be attacked by muggers

208
00:18:14,978 --> 00:18:17,188
on her way down to Onyang.

209
00:18:19,358 --> 00:18:21,608
These are the same men
who broke into the palace.

210
00:18:21,978 --> 00:18:25,948
When they weren't paid for their service,
they decided to attack her out of grudge.

211
00:18:26,318 --> 00:18:30,488
I will make them confess
that they killed the Queen Dowager.

212
00:18:30,578 --> 00:18:33,158
-Kyun.
-This is the easiest way.

213
00:18:33,748 --> 00:18:35,538
You must take this path.

214
00:18:37,918 --> 00:18:39,168
Your Majesty.

215
00:18:39,998 --> 00:18:42,248
You must take the right path.

216
00:18:45,048 --> 00:18:46,468
I await your order.

217
00:18:57,768 --> 00:18:58,768
Your Highness.

218
00:18:58,848 --> 00:19:02,318
We are ready to leave.

219
00:19:05,608 --> 00:19:06,778
We should go.

220
00:19:07,698 --> 00:19:08,778
All right.

221
00:19:14,118 --> 00:19:14,998
You have

222
00:19:15,828 --> 00:19:17,078
all done well.

223
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:25,918
You may leave.

224
00:20:29,188 --> 00:20:30,278
You need to stop.

225
00:20:31,278 --> 00:20:35,198
I must contemplate deeply
on what I'll do with the Queen Dowager.

226
00:20:44,878 --> 00:20:47,248
They'll arrive at the palace in Jinwi
around tomorrow.

227
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:49,048
This is the Queen Dowager.

228
00:20:49,758 --> 00:20:51,378
You must let her pass without pain.

229
00:20:55,178 --> 00:20:58,888
The Queen Dowager has left
for the palace in Onyang?

230
00:20:58,968 --> 00:21:03,348
Yes, she put everything together quickly,
so it wasn't even properly done.

231
00:21:04,058 --> 00:21:05,608
When did she leave?

232
00:21:05,688 --> 00:21:06,898
About two days ago.

233
00:21:06,978 --> 00:21:09,398
She'll probably stay
at the palace in Jinwi today.

234
00:21:10,818 --> 00:21:14,358
She set her dwelling on fire
to avoid getting pushed out.

235
00:21:14,448 --> 00:21:17,368
On top of that, she knows
she's a target of assassination.

236
00:21:17,948 --> 00:21:20,498
Yet she left the palace,
the safest place for her?

237
00:21:26,248 --> 00:21:28,458
I must leave immediately.

238
00:21:28,548 --> 00:21:29,588
No, my lord.

239
00:21:29,668 --> 00:21:31,418
The only way is to break out of jail.

240
00:21:31,508 --> 00:21:33,548
Let me leave immediately!

241
00:21:54,648 --> 00:21:57,318
Your Majesty, there is an urgent message.

242
00:21:58,778 --> 00:21:59,828
Come in.

243
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:10,838
YOUR MAJESTY

244
00:22:11,418 --> 00:22:12,298
What is this?

245
00:22:12,378 --> 00:22:14,838
The Queen Dowager
left this letter for you.

246
00:22:16,258 --> 00:22:17,388
When did she leave this?

247
00:22:17,888 --> 00:22:20,178
She has left two days ago.

248
00:22:20,258 --> 00:22:24,268
She told her adjunct overseer
to give it to you after two days.

249
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:37,818
<i>Eunuch Jung has not come in</i>

250
00:22:37,908 --> 00:22:40,368
<i>since the day after
the Queen Dowager has left.</i>

251
00:22:41,488 --> 00:22:43,238
YOUR MAJESTY

252
00:22:55,378 --> 00:22:57,428
<i>Didn't I tell you, Your Majesty?</i>

253
00:22:58,678 --> 00:23:00,678
<i>If I shed a drop of blood from my neck,</i>

254
00:23:00,758 --> 00:23:02,928
<i>did you think
you were safe on your throne?</i>

255
00:23:04,388 --> 00:23:06,598
<i>Once I die, there will be signs
in my handwriting</i>

256
00:23:07,598 --> 00:23:11,518
<i>put up all over the country
that says I was killed by you.</i>

257
00:23:12,568 --> 00:23:13,608
<i>"The King…</i>

258
00:23:14,398 --> 00:23:16,108
<i>has killed his mother."</i>

259
00:23:18,198 --> 00:23:19,278
<i>Your Majesty, I'm sure</i>

260
00:23:20,278 --> 00:23:23,448
<i>you will now want to save me from death.</i>

261
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:35,958
<i>There is no stronger justification
for the royal family to rebel against you.</i>

262
00:23:36,258 --> 00:23:38,678
<i>You'll become a child
who killed his own mother.</i>

263
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:40,128
<i>I hope</i>

264
00:23:42,348 --> 00:23:44,968
<i>you live in the pain I leave behind,</i>

265
00:23:45,888 --> 00:23:48,058
<i>caught up in bloody rebellion and purge.</i>

266
00:24:00,108 --> 00:24:02,028
Send the cavalry guard
to Jinwi Palace now.

267
00:24:02,118 --> 00:24:04,698
-Yes, Your Majesty.
-Where's Eunuch Jung?

268
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:06,328
Tell him to go to Jinwi Palace now,

269
00:24:06,408 --> 00:24:07,908
that this is urgent!

270
00:24:07,998 --> 00:24:10,618
Eunuch Jung has not come in
since yesterday.

271
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:12,418
Then where is he?

272
00:25:30,948 --> 00:25:31,998
Did the King

273
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,708
send you here?

274
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:37,128
Did you

275
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:40,708
come to kill me?

276
00:25:43,678 --> 00:25:45,298
Shall I die for you?

277
00:25:46,638 --> 00:25:49,058
Once I die, you'll all live in pain.

278
00:25:50,218 --> 00:25:52,848
So I can gladly die for all of you.

279
00:25:53,268 --> 00:25:54,388
Your Highness.

280
00:25:55,058 --> 00:25:56,848
I am the reason…

281
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:00,108
for all of your sins.

282
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:02,488
So please,

283
00:26:03,948 --> 00:26:05,448
you must live.

284
00:26:07,318 --> 00:26:09,778
Did the King tell you to make sure I live?

285
00:26:10,578 --> 00:26:13,288
Your Joseon will stay as a whole
only if I live,

286
00:26:15,118 --> 00:26:17,328
so you finally want to save me now.

287
00:26:26,968 --> 00:26:28,848
Were you so troubled?

288
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:31,258
Is that why

289
00:26:32,178 --> 00:26:34,098
you want to lay down everything?

290
00:26:37,308 --> 00:26:39,978
You said you wanted to live as a housewife

291
00:26:40,728 --> 00:26:43,398
who cooks dinner for her husband
and wait for him to come home.

292
00:26:43,898 --> 00:26:45,238
I forgot that

293
00:26:46,488 --> 00:26:48,988
you were someone who could be happy

294
00:26:51,078 --> 00:26:52,988
with the small things in life.

295
00:26:55,498 --> 00:26:58,498
I should have let you live that life.

296
00:27:00,078 --> 00:27:01,378
I regretted

297
00:27:02,248 --> 00:27:03,918
and regretted again.

298
00:27:06,838 --> 00:27:07,928
Your Highness.

299
00:28:29,628 --> 00:28:30,968
Your Highness.

300
00:28:33,928 --> 00:28:35,638
Please live.

301
00:28:38,018 --> 00:28:39,888
Though life may be…

302
00:28:40,478 --> 00:28:43,398
more humiliating and harsher…

303
00:28:44,478 --> 00:28:45,938
than death.

304
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:50,238
When flowers bloom,

305
00:28:50,778 --> 00:28:53,238
you can look at those flowers

306
00:28:54,068 --> 00:28:54,988
and live a day…

307
00:28:57,158 --> 00:28:59,288
When it snows in the middle of winter,

308
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:02,208
you can look at the snow

309
00:29:02,828 --> 00:29:05,708
and live yet another day.

310
00:29:07,298 --> 00:29:08,918
When you live like that,

311
00:29:09,918 --> 00:29:10,968
one day,

312
00:29:13,888 --> 00:29:16,968
you will find yourself smiling once again.

313
00:29:31,398 --> 00:29:33,028
Let me…

314
00:29:36,158 --> 00:29:38,868
Let me rest for a short while.

315
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:49,768
He died?

316
00:30:52,858 --> 00:30:54,568
Just like that?

317
00:30:55,238 --> 00:30:56,568
Your Majesty.

318
00:31:01,198 --> 00:31:02,238
I must

319
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:05,658
leave the palace for a while.

320
00:31:07,618 --> 00:31:08,828
What do you mean?

321
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:11,378
The Central Army saw me.

322
00:31:12,628 --> 00:31:14,548
They will testify that

323
00:31:14,628 --> 00:31:16,718
I killed Councilor Park

324
00:31:17,298 --> 00:31:18,838
and tried to kill the Queen Dowager.

325
00:31:22,258 --> 00:31:23,308
In the meantime,

326
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:28,348
it will be difficult for me to serve you.

327
00:31:28,438 --> 00:31:29,938
It won't just be for a while.

328
00:31:30,518 --> 00:31:32,018
I will be within the city limits.

329
00:31:33,108 --> 00:31:35,068
I will hide nearby

330
00:31:36,148 --> 00:31:38,148
so that I can run to you
whenever you need me.

331
00:32:20,448 --> 00:32:21,988
If you leave,

332
00:32:22,738 --> 00:32:24,658
who am I supposed to trust?

333
00:32:25,238 --> 00:32:27,788
I asked the consort to look after you.

334
00:32:33,538 --> 00:32:36,628
Just as the late King
asked me to look after you,

335
00:32:38,168 --> 00:32:40,718
the only one I trust in this world

336
00:32:42,298 --> 00:32:43,888
is the consort.

337
00:33:15,788 --> 00:33:19,918
<i>Have you ever considered
that your decisions were not right?</i>

338
00:33:21,218 --> 00:33:23,218
Do you have any intention

339
00:33:25,048 --> 00:33:26,718
of asking for forgiveness

340
00:33:27,298 --> 00:33:29,808
from the ones you killed, from my father?

341
00:33:29,888 --> 00:33:31,058
That will not

342
00:33:32,268 --> 00:33:33,348
happen.

343
00:33:35,728 --> 00:33:38,608
My enemy,
the daughter of a rebel was queen.

344
00:33:38,688 --> 00:33:41,568
And the daughter
of my political enemy, the Sarim,

345
00:33:41,648 --> 00:33:43,528
became the crown princess.

346
00:33:44,108 --> 00:33:46,068
If I did not eliminate them first,

347
00:33:46,158 --> 00:33:48,868
my people and my comrades

348
00:33:50,448 --> 00:33:52,038
would have died.

349
00:33:59,338 --> 00:34:00,708
That is

350
00:34:01,588 --> 00:34:03,088
politics.

351
00:34:09,678 --> 00:34:10,968
<i>I have come to visit.</i>

352
00:34:12,518 --> 00:34:13,888
<i>I will show you</i>

353
00:34:14,638 --> 00:34:16,058
<i>that my politics, my reign</i>

354
00:34:17,648 --> 00:34:20,358
<i>will take a different path than yours.</i>

355
00:34:24,858 --> 00:34:27,568
IN MOURNING

356
00:34:37,498 --> 00:34:39,498
You should not get up so soon.

357
00:34:40,128 --> 00:34:41,998
You lost consciousness for two days.

358
00:34:42,088 --> 00:34:44,418
Who served our guests in that while?

359
00:34:44,508 --> 00:34:46,048
Aunt stepped up.

360
00:34:46,128 --> 00:34:48,218
She's not well-trained in etiquette.

361
00:34:48,928 --> 00:34:52,718
We must have served our guests poorly
as your father had passed.

362
00:34:53,768 --> 00:34:56,018
Mother, you don't have to strain yourself.

363
00:34:58,188 --> 00:34:59,608
I must do this.

364
00:34:59,688 --> 00:35:01,358
I am the lady of this house,

365
00:35:01,438 --> 00:35:04,568
who lived half of my life
as the wife of the councilor.

366
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:07,238
Even though your father has passed,

367
00:35:07,818 --> 00:35:09,368
that fact does not change.

368
00:35:10,448 --> 00:35:12,528
I have much to look after,

369
00:35:12,618 --> 00:35:15,748
our family and the mouths to feed.

370
00:35:17,918 --> 00:35:18,788
And you.

371
00:35:20,958 --> 00:35:23,168
So I must remain strong.

372
00:36:03,338 --> 00:36:04,798
I have won.

373
00:36:06,838 --> 00:36:08,088
Your death

374
00:36:09,628 --> 00:36:11,178
is humble indeed.

375
00:36:26,688 --> 00:36:27,938
All deaths

376
00:36:29,108 --> 00:36:30,528
are humble.

377
00:36:31,698 --> 00:36:33,528
Your era has ended.

378
00:36:34,658 --> 00:36:36,078
This is now my era.

379
00:36:37,158 --> 00:36:40,498
Do you believe your talent was overlooked

380
00:36:41,288 --> 00:36:43,168
because of your subjects?

381
00:36:45,208 --> 00:36:48,508
Do you not know that your subjects

382
00:36:49,588 --> 00:36:52,048
also help you cover up your faults?

383
00:36:52,888 --> 00:36:54,428
I never asked you

384
00:36:55,348 --> 00:36:56,888
to cover up my faults.

385
00:36:57,968 --> 00:37:00,348
From now on, your reign…

386
00:37:01,138 --> 00:37:04,768
is completely your responsibility.

387
00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:11,198
Do you believe…

388
00:37:13,948 --> 00:37:15,368
I will manage well?

389
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:22,828
I do not know.

390
00:37:23,958 --> 00:37:25,128
That is why

391
00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:27,958
I could not trust you.

392
00:37:30,758 --> 00:37:33,928
However, your subjects are
only here to give you advice.

393
00:37:34,678 --> 00:37:36,258
All decisions are made

394
00:37:37,428 --> 00:37:39,678
by the sovereign ruler over our people,

395
00:37:40,888 --> 00:37:44,728
according to your will, Your Majesty.

396
00:39:27,288 --> 00:39:28,918
Why do you cry?

397
00:39:30,578 --> 00:39:31,628
Now,

398
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:35,838
the one I must resent…

399
00:39:37,468 --> 00:39:38,878
is gone.

400
00:40:51,748 --> 00:40:53,958
I will depose you.

401
00:40:55,918 --> 00:40:58,418
It will become a long and tedious fight.

402
00:40:59,008 --> 00:41:00,918
The people will be split
for their own reasons.

403
00:41:01,428 --> 00:41:03,678
It'll take years to convince the officials

404
00:41:05,258 --> 00:41:07,058
and my people.

405
00:41:07,968 --> 00:41:10,138
Even after that, I will be criticized

406
00:41:10,728 --> 00:41:13,018
for dishonoring my parent
until the end of my reign.

407
00:41:14,438 --> 00:41:15,358
However,

408
00:41:15,438 --> 00:41:18,318
it will be much better
than seeing flyers around the country

409
00:41:19,188 --> 00:41:21,568
about how a son has killed his mother.

410
00:41:23,608 --> 00:41:25,368
So please come with me,

411
00:41:26,578 --> 00:41:28,118
back to the tormenting life

412
00:41:29,998 --> 00:41:31,368
which you created.

413
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,248
Just…

414
00:41:36,998 --> 00:41:38,128
kill me.

415
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:41,668
Your Majesty.

416
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:46,888
Please.

417
00:41:49,468 --> 00:41:50,678
Even if you hang yourself

418
00:41:51,678 --> 00:41:54,058
or drink poison, I will save you.

419
00:41:55,098 --> 00:41:58,188
I must show that the King is
fulfilling his duty as a son.

420
00:41:59,938 --> 00:42:01,738
So please continue to live

421
00:42:04,448 --> 00:42:06,198
all alone in this palace

422
00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:11,498
and enjoy

423
00:42:13,368 --> 00:42:14,408
a long life.

424
00:42:35,768 --> 00:42:36,978
Live a long life

425
00:42:40,108 --> 00:42:42,278
all alone?

426
00:43:34,698 --> 00:43:36,458
What is this?

427
00:43:36,828 --> 00:43:39,328
Isn't this a letter from Lady Jeong?

428
00:43:39,418 --> 00:43:40,498
Isn't it?

429
00:43:40,578 --> 00:43:42,288
What's with all the fuss?

430
00:43:43,498 --> 00:43:46,258
-Take a look.
-Okay, I'll look.

431
00:43:46,338 --> 00:43:47,298
I'll look.

432
00:43:49,548 --> 00:43:50,838
Are you teasing me?

433
00:43:51,338 --> 00:43:52,548
You know I can't read.

434
00:43:52,638 --> 00:43:54,508
What did she say?

435
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:55,638
Is she well?

436
00:43:55,888 --> 00:43:58,098
Is her mother-in-law nice to her?

437
00:43:58,808 --> 00:43:59,938
She's well.

438
00:44:00,728 --> 00:44:02,978
-She asks if we're all well.
-Goodness.

439
00:44:03,058 --> 00:44:04,438
She thinks of all of you a lot.

440
00:44:04,518 --> 00:44:07,488
I hear there's an uproar in Hanyang.

441
00:44:07,568 --> 00:44:09,358
Please don't go out and get in trouble.

442
00:44:09,448 --> 00:44:12,448
Make sure you stay home.

443
00:44:12,528 --> 00:44:14,368
Okay?

444
00:44:14,448 --> 00:44:16,698
Okay… Okay?

445
00:44:17,828 --> 00:44:19,368
Can you write that for me?

446
00:44:19,998 --> 00:44:23,078
I hear the Queen Dowager is
becoming something or whatever.

447
00:44:23,168 --> 00:44:27,708
And that crown princess
suddenly died, then came back alive.

448
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:29,378
And who was it? That consort or something…

449
00:44:29,468 --> 00:44:32,798
Anyway, I can't believe
there is so much trouble.

450
00:44:32,888 --> 00:44:34,388
Everyone is talking about it.

451
00:44:35,388 --> 00:44:37,388
There's no use in giving advice here.

452
00:44:38,018 --> 00:44:39,638
She'll manage.

453
00:44:40,228 --> 00:44:43,308
Lord Lim, you're really cold-hearted.

454
00:44:45,898 --> 00:44:47,148
Goodness.

455
00:44:53,868 --> 00:44:54,828
Hey.

456
00:44:54,908 --> 00:44:56,868
You need me around here, don't you?

457
00:44:56,948 --> 00:44:59,788
What do you mean?
You don't do anything around here.

458
00:45:02,038 --> 00:45:06,548
I take care of the tributary payment
and the things with the local government.

459
00:45:06,628 --> 00:45:08,128
That's not a big deal.

460
00:45:08,508 --> 00:45:10,338
If you aren't around, we'll still manage.

461
00:45:10,418 --> 00:45:12,218
We can go on even without Lady Jeong.

462
00:45:15,718 --> 00:45:16,558
Why?

463
00:45:17,218 --> 00:45:19,558
Did the men up high in Hanyang
ask you to come?

464
00:45:19,638 --> 00:45:20,638
Will you go?

465
00:45:23,268 --> 00:45:25,058
What will I do there anyway?

466
00:45:25,648 --> 00:45:27,898
I'll end up seeing bureaucrats
bickering one another,

467
00:45:28,648 --> 00:45:30,738
instead of hearing our people.

468
00:45:31,318 --> 00:45:33,568
The noblemen who can
listen to what we have to say

469
00:45:33,658 --> 00:45:35,988
keep avoiding such places out of disgust.

470
00:45:36,068 --> 00:45:39,328
That's why only those
who won't listen to us remain there.

471
00:45:43,158 --> 00:45:44,368
So?

472
00:45:45,128 --> 00:45:46,168
Are you telling me to go?

473
00:45:47,168 --> 00:45:48,248
Me?

474
00:45:50,208 --> 00:45:52,628
Why do you do this to me?

475
00:45:58,178 --> 00:46:01,058
<i>How are you, master?</i>

476
00:46:01,678 --> 00:46:03,388
<i>Is everyone well?</i>

477
00:46:04,188 --> 00:46:07,478
<i>I see Bamboo Grove Village
once in a while in my dreams.</i>

478
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:11,818
<i>The village holds dearly in my heart.</i>

479
00:46:14,858 --> 00:46:16,108
Look at this.

480
00:46:16,198 --> 00:46:19,118
<i>Although there are many,
none are too wise.</i>

481
00:46:19,908 --> 00:46:21,948
<i>So it is always a challenge.</i>

482
00:46:22,908 --> 00:46:26,418
<i>Please, be by my side in the palace.</i>

483
00:46:34,048 --> 00:46:35,258
<i>Consort Yoo.</i>

484
00:46:35,588 --> 00:46:37,678
<i>Fifth Left Officer
of the Ministry of Taxation is here.</i>

485
00:46:49,398 --> 00:46:52,978
Fifth Left Officer Lim is here
to report to Consort Yoo.

486
00:46:56,148 --> 00:46:57,948
I hear the Ministry of Taxation is busy,

487
00:46:58,028 --> 00:46:59,448
and it must be true.

488
00:47:00,698 --> 00:47:02,078
You came to the palace a while ago,

489
00:47:02,158 --> 00:47:03,998
but only come see me now.

490
00:47:04,078 --> 00:47:06,498
I obtained my office
thanks to the Left Minister,

491
00:47:06,998 --> 00:47:08,378
so I focused on staying low

492
00:47:09,078 --> 00:47:11,588
and doing my job the best I can.

493
00:47:12,548 --> 00:47:14,008
I'm glad you're here.

494
00:47:15,918 --> 00:47:17,468
I heard you wanted to take the exam

495
00:47:17,548 --> 00:47:19,758
instead of accepting the recommendation.

496
00:47:20,348 --> 00:47:23,058
Many members of the Sarim
have become officials,

497
00:47:23,138 --> 00:47:24,808
which makes them
other meritorious subjects,

498
00:47:25,638 --> 00:47:27,938
and the harm they do is
also quite troubling.

499
00:47:29,148 --> 00:47:31,108
Is there a reason
why you changed your mind?

500
00:47:31,898 --> 00:47:33,358
I began to feel the urgency.

501
00:47:34,228 --> 00:47:37,648
The crops continue to be bad.
If we do not reduce labor and offerings,

502
00:47:38,738 --> 00:47:42,868
come next year, we will see
even people in the city starving to death.

503
00:47:43,868 --> 00:47:44,948
That is why

504
00:47:46,448 --> 00:47:48,618
I needed you, Master Lim.

505
00:47:55,548 --> 00:47:56,718
Consort Yoo has…

506
00:47:57,218 --> 00:47:58,928
Bring the royal physician at once!

507
00:48:11,768 --> 00:48:14,188
Your Majesty,
Consort Yoo gave birth to a child.

508
00:48:14,268 --> 00:48:15,688
How is she?

509
00:48:15,778 --> 00:48:17,318
Is she all right?

510
00:48:17,398 --> 00:48:19,528
Yes, Your Majesty. She is healthy.

511
00:48:31,248 --> 00:48:33,628
Your Majesty, congratulations.

512
00:48:33,708 --> 00:48:35,418
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

513
00:48:50,018 --> 00:48:51,018
Are you all right?

514
00:48:51,768 --> 00:48:52,848
Yes.

515
00:48:55,818 --> 00:48:57,858
He's a boy.

516
00:48:59,358 --> 00:49:00,568
He looks…

517
00:49:03,448 --> 00:49:04,488
really ugly.

518
00:49:06,488 --> 00:49:08,408
He looks exactly like you.

519
00:49:09,618 --> 00:49:12,418
Do I look like this?

520
00:49:12,498 --> 00:49:15,748
Everyone complimented him and said
he is a handsome boy.

521
00:49:16,338 --> 00:49:17,208
Do you not think so?

522
00:49:17,798 --> 00:49:19,258
I do.

523
00:49:23,638 --> 00:49:25,048
Would you like to hold him?

524
00:49:35,728 --> 00:49:37,318
I am your father.

525
00:49:43,398 --> 00:49:44,818
You've done well.

526
00:50:09,098 --> 00:50:10,348
<i>You fool.</i>

527
00:50:11,428 --> 00:50:14,348
<i>After creating a world
where everything runs by your command,</i>

528
00:50:15,398 --> 00:50:16,938
<i>what will you do?</i>

529
00:50:20,648 --> 00:50:25,068
<i>Are you confident
that you will be different from a tyrant?</i>

530
00:50:28,528 --> 00:50:30,618
<i>Are the people by your side
in this new world</i>

531
00:50:31,408 --> 00:50:33,408
<i>genuinely loyal subjects…</i>

532
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:36,288
<i>or are they treacherous?</i>

533
00:50:53,218 --> 00:50:54,268
Minister Cho.

534
00:50:55,518 --> 00:50:56,518
Yes?

535
00:50:56,598 --> 00:50:58,398
I need you to go into exile for a while.

536
00:51:09,318 --> 00:51:11,158
The Minister of War became too big

537
00:51:11,778 --> 00:51:13,868
after our reorganization.

538
00:51:15,368 --> 00:51:18,998
The Three Offices and the Sarim scholars
petition every single day.

539
00:51:21,128 --> 00:51:22,248
What can I do?

540
00:51:23,248 --> 00:51:25,218
Someone will have to be responsible.

541
00:51:25,298 --> 00:51:26,378
Was this

542
00:51:27,928 --> 00:51:29,888
the end of my worth from the start?

543
00:51:34,428 --> 00:51:35,848
<i>What are the guards doing?</i>

544
00:51:35,928 --> 00:51:37,978
Why is the commandant standing still?

545
00:52:03,038 --> 00:52:04,998
How could I ever forget

546
00:52:06,168 --> 00:52:08,048
that you were also a meritorious subject?

547
00:52:10,888 --> 00:52:12,548
I'll consider your contributions

548
00:52:12,638 --> 00:52:14,388
and won't punish you any further.

549
00:52:18,938 --> 00:52:20,188
What about Lady Cho?

550
00:52:21,308 --> 00:52:23,308
She's a royal concubine I adore.

551
00:52:23,898 --> 00:52:25,228
She will be…

552
00:52:27,398 --> 00:52:28,608
cared for.

553
00:52:30,818 --> 00:52:32,028
I am grateful…

554
00:52:34,028 --> 00:52:35,408
for your mercy.

555
00:52:52,968 --> 00:52:55,008
Didn't you want a subject
that is absolutely loyal?

556
00:52:58,978 --> 00:53:03,768
Instead of those who use
all kinds of justifications to stop you,

557
00:53:05,768 --> 00:53:08,068
I can be more loyal to you.

558
00:53:08,148 --> 00:53:09,148
So…

559
00:53:10,488 --> 00:53:12,108
why do you abandon me?

560
00:53:55,948 --> 00:53:57,028
Father.

561
00:53:59,448 --> 00:54:00,498
What are you stitching?

562
00:54:01,698 --> 00:54:04,418
It's a present for my sister-in-law
once the baby is born.

563
00:54:04,998 --> 00:54:06,498
Why do you look after her?

564
00:54:07,538 --> 00:54:09,798
My silly brother is unsightly,

565
00:54:11,048 --> 00:54:13,718
but what can I do?
The baby will still be my nephew.

566
00:54:18,178 --> 00:54:19,388
Lady Cho.

567
00:54:20,428 --> 00:54:21,598
I must…

568
00:54:24,138 --> 00:54:25,728
travel far for a while.

569
00:54:28,518 --> 00:54:29,978
Where are you going?

570
00:54:38,158 --> 00:54:39,328
Lady Cho!

571
00:54:40,908 --> 00:54:42,698
I will make my case with His Majesty!

572
00:54:42,788 --> 00:54:46,168
He cannot do this.
He cannot do this to you!

573
00:54:46,248 --> 00:54:47,628
This is a process we must go through.

574
00:54:47,708 --> 00:54:49,958
Why should you get exiled?

575
00:54:50,038 --> 00:54:51,998
Consort Yoo committed a crime,

576
00:54:52,338 --> 00:54:54,918
yet she continues to dwell here
under the Sarim's protection.

577
00:54:55,008 --> 00:54:56,548
Why should you go?

578
00:54:59,428 --> 00:55:00,808
Is it because…

579
00:55:03,268 --> 00:55:04,678
I did not gain his favor?

580
00:55:04,768 --> 00:55:05,728
No.

581
00:55:07,098 --> 00:55:08,728
I forgot for a moment

582
00:55:08,808 --> 00:55:12,068
that His Majesty will not condone
the domination of his wife's family.

583
00:55:14,108 --> 00:55:15,398
Father…

584
00:55:24,698 --> 00:55:26,748
The Sarim won't hold power forever.

585
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:29,628
Hold out until their power dwindles.

586
00:55:48,388 --> 00:55:51,478
His Majesty dismissed
Minister Cho from his office

587
00:55:51,898 --> 00:55:53,478
and sent him on an exile.

588
00:55:55,318 --> 00:55:56,488
His Majesty drove out

589
00:55:57,068 --> 00:56:01,028
someone who could have taken his side.

590
00:56:03,238 --> 00:56:06,908
Did you find out the sentiment
of the Sarim in Yeongnam?

591
00:56:06,998 --> 00:56:09,038
Do you really plan on using them?

592
00:56:09,998 --> 00:56:12,418
Left Minister will protest violently.

593
00:56:13,748 --> 00:56:18,418
I'll also need those in power
who will hold my people in check.

594
00:56:46,488 --> 00:56:48,288
Why did you come out this far?

595
00:56:48,788 --> 00:56:52,498
You will fall into trouble
if Consort Yoo finds out.

596
00:56:56,748 --> 00:56:58,458
His Majesty gave me his permission.

597
00:57:01,678 --> 00:57:03,388
You must stay strong and hold out.

598
00:57:04,638 --> 00:57:07,928
I will protect our family and our name.

599
00:57:10,138 --> 00:57:13,898
I brought you up like this
to let you live a comfortable life.

600
00:57:14,688 --> 00:57:17,858
Do not do anything until the day I return.

601
00:57:17,938 --> 00:57:18,898
No.

602
00:57:20,188 --> 00:57:23,278
Even if I must beg His Majesty,
I will lie with him.

603
00:57:26,078 --> 00:57:27,488
I will bear him a son.

604
00:57:28,488 --> 00:57:30,248
I will humor the consort if I must

605
00:57:30,908 --> 00:57:32,748
and relieve you from your exile.

606
00:57:33,958 --> 00:57:37,498
I will build up enough strength
so that no one dare

607
00:57:38,498 --> 00:57:40,128
to hurt you or my brother.

608
00:57:45,428 --> 00:57:47,048
I will protect you now,

609
00:57:48,718 --> 00:57:49,968
Father.

610
00:57:53,268 --> 00:57:54,768
I may not be the queen,

611
00:57:56,148 --> 00:57:57,608
but I shall become

612
00:57:58,358 --> 00:57:59,818
the Queen Dowager.

613
00:58:37,898 --> 00:58:40,898
I'd like to make Lady Cho
a Noble Lady of rank junior one.

614
00:58:41,688 --> 00:58:42,988
I see.

615
00:58:43,648 --> 00:58:46,658
I shall adore Lady Cho and look after her.

616
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:49,578
Before I do that,

617
00:58:52,368 --> 00:58:53,948
I'd like to hold your installation

618
00:58:55,158 --> 00:58:56,208
as the queen.

619
00:58:58,878 --> 00:58:59,958
Your Majesty.

620
00:59:01,128 --> 00:59:02,878
From the moment I first met you,

621
00:59:03,838 --> 00:59:07,508
I knew you were worthy of being the mother
and a loyal subject of this nation.

622
00:59:10,968 --> 00:59:13,348
That you're a woman who sees and knows

623
00:59:14,888 --> 00:59:16,638
the things I overlook.

624
00:59:16,728 --> 00:59:21,228
"She'll prove to be useful,
so I shall take her in."

625
00:59:22,728 --> 00:59:24,188
That's what I thought.

626
00:59:26,318 --> 00:59:29,778
If I had known you were
such a frightening and mean subject…

627
00:59:30,368 --> 00:59:32,788
If you did, you wouldn't have had me
in the selection.

628
00:59:37,498 --> 00:59:38,748
Even if I knew,

629
00:59:40,288 --> 00:59:41,788
I would have done the same.

630
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:46,718
It's a tough journey to stay together,

631
00:59:47,758 --> 00:59:50,178
but it's still easier
than losing you and the Prince.

632
01:01:00,658 --> 01:01:01,918
Congratulations,

633
01:01:01,998 --> 01:01:03,208
Your Highness.

634
01:01:03,958 --> 01:01:06,878
Escorting you to the ceremony
is my job as a royal concubine.

635
01:01:08,298 --> 01:01:10,548
I'd like to escort you to the ceremony.

636
01:01:10,628 --> 01:01:12,718
Please allow me to do so.

637
01:01:15,388 --> 01:01:16,718
Thank you for your help.

638
01:01:19,348 --> 01:01:20,428
It's an honor.

639
01:02:15,818 --> 01:02:17,318
<i>Do you regret it?</i>

640
01:02:20,908 --> 01:02:22,658
<i>I already do.</i>

641
01:02:25,788 --> 01:02:28,378
<i>You are a shimmering blade</i>

642
01:02:28,918 --> 01:02:30,668
<i>hanging above my head.</i>

643
01:02:33,628 --> 01:02:36,388
<i>They say there must be a sword
hanging above</i>

644
01:02:37,138 --> 01:02:39,308
<i>in order to feel
the gravity of the throne.</i>

645
01:02:40,678 --> 01:02:43,978
<i>You are my one and only sanctuary.</i>

646
01:02:45,688 --> 01:02:49,228
<i>I shall eternally be your sanctuary.</i>

647
01:04:09,478 --> 01:04:11,478
So I shall walk with you.

648
01:04:12,768 --> 01:04:14,728
For you are the sword above my head

649
01:04:15,858 --> 01:04:17,358
and my sanctuary.

650
01:04:24,788 --> 01:04:26,448
<i>You are my lover,</i>

651
01:04:27,748 --> 01:04:29,498
<i>my Queen,</i>

652
01:04:32,168 --> 01:04:33,168
<i>and…</i>

653
01:04:34,668 --> 01:04:36,008
<i>my political rival.</i>

654
01:05:01,658 --> 01:05:04,238
BLOODY HEART

655
01:05:55,418 --> 01:05:58,588
