[The Wanted Detective]

2
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,780
[Episode 28]

3
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,950
I really didn't expect

4
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,070
to encounter man-eating monsters here.

5
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,270
Let me put it this way.

6
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,039
If we had run slower,

7
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,039
you wouldn't have seen us again.

8
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,920
I have an idea.

9
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,509
Just to be on the safe side,

10
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:54,200
let's take turns keeping watch tonight.

11
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,460
Don't put out the fire.

12
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,789
Okay.

13
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,280
I'll take the first shift tonight.

14
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,870
Okay.

15
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:22,680
I can't believe

16
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,280
such creatures truly exist.

17
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,329
Don't be afraid.

18
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,470
There is no such thing
as ghosts or monsters.

19
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,600
That creature is...

20
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:29,600
probably a species

21
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,600
we've never seen.

22
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,560
I'm not afraid.

23
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,890
Pretend to be asleep.

24
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,710
Why is it a child?

25
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,200
Follow up to check it out!

26
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:39,400
What's this stuff?

27
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,530
Where did you get it?

28
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,370
How come they're all women?

29
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,430
You're not Haiya people.

30
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,490
Where are you from?

31
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,750
There are survivors indeed.

32
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,120
We're from the Qi Kingdom.

33
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,190
Can we have a word?

34
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:18,880
Go away!

35
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,750
We mean no harm.

36
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,950
Go away now!

37
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,550
Let's go.

38
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,300
Even though we've found survivors,

39
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,600
they all seem savage.

40
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,510
Yeah.

41
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,390
They wouldn't hesitate
to launch fatal strikes.

42
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,020
Beiming,

43
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,830
let's just raid their campsite.

44
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,070
We're investigators,

45
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,100
not bandits.

46
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,159
Why attempt a raid?

47
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,750
But they have our luggage now.

48
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,420
Besides,

49
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,150
Madman's medical chest

50
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,310
was taken too.

51
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,220
Did you deliberately tell them

52
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,620
we're from the Qi Kingdom

53
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,390
just to see

54
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,390
how they'd react?

55
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,460
Yes.

56
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,660
Evidently, they do know

57
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,220
what exactly happened

58
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,280
in Haiya years ago.

59
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,390
This is

60
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,460
good news for us.

61
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:14,980
But they're very hostile

62
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,020
toward us.

63
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,460
How should we...

64
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,260
It's okay.
Let's resume the discussion tomorrow.

65
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,300
Beiming.

66
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:33,540
Why do we have to

67
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,740
prepare so much food?

68
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,630
This will be

69
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,100
our ticket in.

70
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,510
Those we saw on the campsite yesterday

71
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,020
all seemed feeble and weak.

72
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,420
That kid had the nerve to sneak in

73
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,480
and steal our food.

74
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:46,420
Also, I noticed that the people

75
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,280
on that campsite were all female.

76
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,710
Given that, I suspect

77
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,430
all the men there already...

78
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,310
I got it.

79
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,659
The food can buy

80
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,150
our way into their place.

81
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,980
After all,

82
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,870
people are the most fragile

83
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,980
when they're hungry.

84
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,660
Right?

85
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,720
They're having a hard time now.

86
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,520
We...

87
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,920
should help them,

88
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,870
no matter what.

89
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,830
Those monsters have appeared

90
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,070
more and more frequently lately.

91
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,510
We've been hiding here the entire time.

92
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,440
Our food supplies are running low.

93
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,660
I'm afraid we can't sustain ourselves
for too much longer.

94
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,750
Still no word from Dasong and the guys?

95
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,410
They've gone for over a month.

96
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,600
I'm afraid they're already...

97
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,950
Luo Shu!

98
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,460
Luo Shu!

99
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,930
Those from the Qi Kingdom
we met last night

100
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,130
have come here again.

101
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,210
Let's go.

102
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,590
How dare you come back? What do you want?

103
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,630
Do you have a death wish or what?

104
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,580
Miss, please calm down.

105
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,680
Look carefully.

106
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,220
We're not carrying any weapons.

107
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,880
We've brought you something.

108
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,100
What exactly do you want?

109
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:05,980
We've notice that you seem

110
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,100
to have starved for a long time,

111
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,220
so we decided to bring you food.

112
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:08,870
That's right.

113
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,220
We can have a nice chat.

114
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,870
Take your things back!

115
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,070
Stop pretending to be compassionate,

116
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,270
you Qi people!

117
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,460
Step back!

118
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:18,570
Get out of here!

119
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,580
Okay!

120
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,070
We'll step back.

121
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,980
I'll leave these things on the ground.

122
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,580
Beiming...

123
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,220
It's okay.

124
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,290
Come get them yourselves!

125
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,960
Place the food here.

126
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,040
We're leaving now!

127
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,420
Let's go.

128
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,770
How do we deal with those things?

129
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,420
Qi people would never be that kind.

130
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,220
I bet something must be wrong

131
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,020
with what they brought us.

132
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:45,750
But...

133
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,310
that is food.

134
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,710
Where is your pride?

135
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,900
I have children at home.

136
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,340
They've been hungry for days.

137
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,340
I must do something

138
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,540
before they starve to death!

139
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,420
Enough. Stop bickering.

140
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,830
Bring those things in.

141
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,710
Test if they're poisoned.

142
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,970
Distribute them if they're proven safe.

143
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,850
We offered them so much food,

144
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,150
yet

145
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,580
they shot arrows at you.

146
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,310
We're unable to

147
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,770
soothe their resentment.

148
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,630
I just hope they would realize

149
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,710
that we mean well.

150
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,460
Besides,

151
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,120
at least that arrow today

152
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,450
was aimed at the ground,

153
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,919
not at us.

154
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,480
But, Beiming,

155
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,059
now the problem is

156
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,140
our supplies are running low,

157
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,090
since we've given them

158
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,020
much of our food.

159
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,870
Only these Haiya people

160
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,570
can help us

161
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,830
find out what really happened years ago.

162
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,100
Let's go pluck some fruits.

163
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,180
Fine.

164
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,430
Does everyone have a portion now?

165
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,450
You should eat something too.

166
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,380
I'm not used to this kind of food.

167
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,580
Keep it for yourself.

168
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,090
Are you going out?

169
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,500
We got food from those Qi people,

170
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,760
but it won't last long.

171
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,540
I must go to that place.

172
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,300
But it's too dangerous there.

173
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,580
Won't we be left in the lurch

174
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,110
if anything happens to you?

175
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,810
I'm going there alone this time.

176
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,470
If I can't come back in 15 days,

177
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,420
you and the others must leave here.

178
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,240
Staying put will only
get yourselves killed.

179
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,120
Luo Shu...

180
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,060
Keep yourself safe.

181
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:27,780
Xing?

182
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,610
Why are you out again?

183
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,420
Go back now.

184
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,970
You're not allowed to follow me.

185
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,060
This place is dangerous.

186
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:38,730
Go back now.

187
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,380
What's wrong?

188
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:49,450
Xing!

189
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:57,380
Xing!

190
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:07,950
Go check it out.

191
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,540
Xing, Xing!

192
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,420
Back off!

193
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,660
There's poison in him.

194
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,210
Touch him,

195
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:20,300
and I'll kill you!

196
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,330
He's a physician.

197
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,730
He's here to save the boy.

198
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,300
He was bitten by a viper.

199
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,060
My medical chest...

200
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,210
There's first-aid medicine in it.

201
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,340
My medical chest...

202
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,140
They stole it.

203
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,470
It is now on Haiya people's campsite.

204
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,260
Make way.

205
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,140
Let's take him to the campsite.

206
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:46,850
Hold on!

207
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,330
You can't go there.

208
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,780
We don't have time to hear you

209
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,900
talking about the feuds between Qi people

210
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,500
and Haiya people now.

211
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,570
If you are to save the boy's life,

212
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,700
you must do as we say.

213
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,140
Let's go.

214
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:58,900
Hurry.

215
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:02,780
Open the gate.

216
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,380
But they're from the Qi Kingdom.

217
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,500
I told you to open the gate.

218
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,960
Xing was bitten by a viper!

219
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,260
Open up now!

220
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,210
Be quick!

221
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,090
Go fetch my medical chest.

222
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:22,210
I didn't take it.

223
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,140
I don't know where it is.

224
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,180
It's a black chest

225
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:24,850
with a little white dragon on it.

226
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:25,730
Look for it!

227
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,500
Go!

228
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,060
Make it quick!

229
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:27,730
Everyone, search for it!

230
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,390
Make sure you find that chest!

231
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,920
The venom is getting to his heart.

232
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:37,100
We can't delay the treatment anymore.

233
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,300
My medical chest... Where is it?

234
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,570
Found it!

235
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:42,370
Bring it here!

236
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,140
Give it to me.

237
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:43,450
The chest...

238
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,110
Put it here.

239
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:48,810
Hand me my acupuncture kit.

240
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,800
-Xing.
-Xing.

241
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,500
Xing!

242
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:11,820
Thank God!

243
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,500
Though you're from the Qi Kingdom,

244
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,290
we Haiya people

245
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,660
can tell you're nice and kind.

246
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,120
Thank you for saving Xing.

247
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,970
Also, thank you for saving Luo Shu,

248
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:31,540
and for the food you sent us,

249
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,620
which has saved many of our people.

250
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,730
Don't mention it.

251
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,090
It was just a small favor.

252
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,020
I'd also like to thank you

253
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,350
for putting trust in us.

254
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,850
I'll persuade the others

255
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,450
to let you stay here for the night.

256
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,020
You may leave tomorrow morning.

257
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,180
Okay. Thanks.

258
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,500
I have a question...

259
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,300
Why do Haiya people

260
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,060
harbor enormous hatred

261
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,320
toward the Qi Kingdom?

262
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,190
I also have a question.

263
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,170
The Qi Kingdom has enforced
a blockade on Haiya.

264
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,500
There is no way in or out.

265
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,090
How did you get reach this place?

266
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,420
What's the purpose of your visit to Haiya?

267
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:04,810
An elder

268
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:05,970
gave me a map.

269
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,060
We came to Haiya

270
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:07,930
for an investigation

271
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:08,730
on the Haiya Case.

272
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:09,660
Investigation?

273
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:12,660
Don't you know

274
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,780
what your own kingdom did?

275
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,440
Is your visit even necessary?

276
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:17,970
The Haiya Case is

277
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,180
classified in the Qi Kingdom.

278
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:20,830
That is why

279
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,020
we had to make this visit.

280
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,820
It should really be classified.

281
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,540
After all, how can the Qi Kingdom

282
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,180
reveal its own unconscionable

283
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,910
and inhuman acts to the public?

284
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,380
I'm done talking.

285
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,070
Get some rest now, you lot.

286
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,980
Didn't get an answer?

287
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,390
She still has doubts about us.

288
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,150
Why not let me give it a try?

289
00:14:58,850 --> 00:14:59,710
If you're here to ask me about

290
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:00,780
the history
between the Qi Kingdom and Haiya,

291
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,240
I have nothing to tell you.

292
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,280
Try not to ruin

293
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,230
the good impression you left on me.

294
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,380
Miss Luo,

295
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:10,680
I don't know

296
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,120
what's on your mind,

297
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,210
but I can tell

298
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,470
that everyone here counts on you.

299
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,430
To put myself in your shoes,

300
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,550
though we're both women,

301
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,950
I'm afraid I can't do

302
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,640
what you're doing here—

303
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,110
shouldering all the responsibilities.

304
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:25,780
Outsiders such as ourselves

305
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,190
can hardly imagine

306
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,660
the hardships you've been through.

307
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,110
What is it that you're trying to say?

308
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:30,900
Above all,

309
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,230
we only want to help you.

310
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,500
Help us?

311
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,070
If it weren't for the Qi Kingdom,

312
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,710
we wouldn't be in the current situation.

313
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,710
All the misery and suffering

314
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,500
imposed on us

315
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,190
are attributed to your kingdom.

316
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,850
But you're offering help now.

317
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,010
Doesn't it sound ridiculous?

318
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,710
I'm a citizen of the Qi Kingdom,

319
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,740
but I'm actually from Haiya.

320
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,740
You're from Haiya?

321
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,350
Not just me.

322
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,190
That young man, Mr. Xiao, is

323
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,460
also from Haiya.

324
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,690
How is that possible?

325
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:05,880
I'm not lying to you.

326
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,270
We were born in Haiya.

327
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,740
But because of what happened years ago,

328
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,470
we were taken to the Qi Kingdom.

329
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,830
Also because of those happenings,

330
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,910
our families were torn apart.

331
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,140
So, we can actually feel

332
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,310
the pain and grief

333
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,900
you've experienced.

334
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,880
The purpose of our visit

335
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,880
is to find out what truly happened.

336
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,860
When the truth is out,

337
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,350
perhaps we'll be able to
diffuse the tension

338
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,210
between the Qi Kingdom and Haiya.

339
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,550
Suppose you're telling the truth,

340
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,810
what can you and your little group

341
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,220
do to help?

342
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,920
But we have to try first, right?

343
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,110
We're just like you.

344
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,740
You've been taking care of your fellows.

345
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,550
I believe you've never
thought of quitting,

346
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,310
despite all the difficulties.

347
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:06,940
Similarly, there are tasks

348
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,550
we must complete.

349
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,980
So, I implore you to trust us.

350
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,349
We would never harm

351
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:13,380
our own people.

352
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,000
Xiaoyue,

353
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,630
bring in some water.

354
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:21,910
Sit down and talk.

355
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:22,599
Okay.

356
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:29,780
Thank you.

357
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,680
Answer my question.

358
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,600
Haiya is a forbidden topic
in the Qi Kingdom.

359
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,660
How did you find out

360
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,390
you're originally from Haiya?

361
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,900
We learned

362
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,310
that the Qi army committed a massacre.

363
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,420
Then, from an orphan registry,

364
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,830
we found out about our origins.

365
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,510
But we don't know why the Qi Kingdom

366
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,750
would do that kind of crime.

367
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,860
This is the reason we...

368
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,110
You don't know the cause.

369
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,380
Neither do we.

370
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,560
You don't know that either?

371
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,060
Luo Shu is telling the truth.

372
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,310
Back then, we lived

373
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,350
in a mountain village bordering Haiya.

374
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,080
The Qi army didn't discover us,

375
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,060
so we luckily escaped death.

376
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,700
Being little kids at that time,

377
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,190
we didn't know anything,

378
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,500
except for the fact

379
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,180
that from then on,

380
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,750
we started being

381
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,990
surrounded by many, many monsters.

382
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,380
Didn't the adults tell you

383
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,550
what was going on?

384
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,220
All they told us was

385
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,510
that the Qi Kingdom slaughtered

386
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,510
our people,

387
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,880
that the Qi Kingdom
introduced those monsters to our land,

388
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,340
and that the Qi Kingdom
destroyed our homes.

389
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,790
In fact, even they didn't know

390
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,380
how all of that happened.

391
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,430
A catastrophe just befell.

392
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:38,150
Haven't you thought of
figuring out the truth?

393
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:40,860
Over these years,

394
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,550
we've been

395
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,310
in a living hell,

396
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,950
hiding from place to place.

397
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,180
We've helplessly watched our beloved ones

398
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,350
die of cold, starvation,

399
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,080
and the monsters' attacks.

400
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,140
Every day when we wake up from sleep,

401
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,620
all we can think of is

402
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,480
how to survive.

403
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,420
Find out the truth?

404
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,590
How?

405
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,420
What can we do even if we know the truth?

406
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,020
What can we possibly change?

407
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,750
We're nothing but a cloud of ants

408
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,590
that haven't been crushed.

409
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,940
We're not that capable.

410
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,990
We have told you

411
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,660
everything we know.

412
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,420
Sorry.

413
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,070
On this matter,

414
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,310
we can't be of much help.

415
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:26,910
I understand.

416
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,510
Thank you both for being honest with me.

417
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:44,590
Did you

418
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,550
hear any noise?

419
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,380
Is it the wind outside?

420
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,940
I think it's Xiaoyue.

421
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,550
Let's go!

422
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,270
She's not beyond cure.

423
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,370
Did wild beasts get in here?

424
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,060
She was bitten by a human,

425
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,750
rather than a beast.

426
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,560
How could it be a human?

427
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,660
Miss Xiaoyue,

428
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,860
what just happened?

429
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,830
I don't know.

430
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,110
I simply came out to light the lanterns.

431
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:24,590
When there was light,

432
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,070
I looked down

433
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,140
and found her here.

434
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,620
Miss Huo,

435
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,040
get me my medical chest.

436
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,470
Okay.

437
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,380
Beiming.

438
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,110
There are bloodstains on the eave,

439
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,840
extending all the way outward.

440
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:43,790
Xueman,

441
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:44,510
gather everyone

442
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,310
on the campsite.

443
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,460
Tong Shuang, let's go check it out.

444
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,220
Wait!

445
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,180
There are many wild animals outside.

446
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,110
Maybe you should give up the chase.

447
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,900
Don't worry.

448
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,270
Where?

449
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:57,940
Here.

450
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,550
Beiming, over there.

451
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,110
Let's go.

452
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,970
The blood trail ends here.

453
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:22,840
It's hard to conduct a search
in this vast forest.

454
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:25,700
Let's go.

455
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,760
I smell blood.

456
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,540
Tong Shuang.

457
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:42,900
It's still warm.

458
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,570
Like the what happened on the campsite,

459
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,730
it was bitten and killed by a human.

460
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,140
What kind of monster could that be?

461
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,160
This person had the guts

462
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,490
to eat such a scary hare.

463
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,150
Watch out.

464
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,590
There might be beasts nearby.

465
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,660
How is that girl doing?

466
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,160
She was revived.

467
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,970
Thank you.

468
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,400
What exactly happened tonight?

469
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,790
As you know,

470
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,970
monsters appear quite often here.

471
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,880
They break in sometimes.

472
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,550
That monster

473
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,640
didn't just break in, right?

474
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,070
What do you mean?

475
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,230
I don't understand.

476
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,460
Do you not understand,

477
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,720
or are you concealing something?

478
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,380
At that time, Feng Qingzhuo said...

479
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,780
She was bitten by a human,

480
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,790
rather than a beast.

481
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,490
Your reaction upon hearing

482
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,850
a human bitting another human seemed odd.

483
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,700
I guess

484
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,220
the same thing had happened before, right?

485
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,080
I examined the footprints nearby

486
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,590
and found that monster

487
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,140
didn't come from outside.

488
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,430
Instead, he seemed to be here
the entire time.

489
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,380
Miss Luo,

490
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,380
I don't know if our meaning

491
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,510
has got across to you,

492
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,030
or if you would trust us.

493
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,380
But the monster we're facing now

494
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,440
is very dangerous.

495
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,750
There's no way you and your fellows

496
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,410
can take him down yourselves.

497
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,460
If you don't want anyone around you

498
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,720
to get in danger again,

499
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,220
then please trust us.

500
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,660
Fine.

501
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,360
I'll take you to a place.

502
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,240
Why is there a smell of corpses?

503
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,510
Aren't you wondering

504
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,830
about that monster?

505
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,680
Come down here with me.

506
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,760
Hand me that torch.

507
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,110
Be careful.

508
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,060
I'll examine the bodies.

509
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,550
No need.

510
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,270
They all starved to death.

511
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,440
Starved to death?

512
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,040
How come?

513
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:45,750
Were they

514
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,970
your enemies?

515
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,220
They were our family members.

516
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,140
Why would you lock your family members

517
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,100
in cages and let them starve to death?

518
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,300
Have you gone insane?

519
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,670
We're not insane.

520
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,560
They were.

521
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:01,900
Didn't you see

522
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,070
that monster?

523
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,750
Actually,

524
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,940
that is my brother, Luo Sen.

525
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,350
This is the cage

526
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,510
he was kept in.

527
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,950
How did all that happen?

528
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,550
Years ago,

529
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,030
the Qi army

530
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,690
committed a massacre in a town

531
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,660
in the center of Haiya,

532
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,070
which we called

533
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,830
the Lonely Town.

534
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,980
After the Qi army's atrocities,

535
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:31,980
the Lonely Town

536
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,890
became the most mysterious

537
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,580
and dangerous place in Haiya.

538
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:38,270
It's said that all visitors to that town

539
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,220
would end up losing their souls to demons

540
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,250
and turning into monsters.

541
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,590
The supplies on the campsite

542
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,660
were not enough to sustain us

543
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,790
through the winter.

544
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,640
In order to survive,

545
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,260
my older brother

546
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,180
and the other men on the campsite

547
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,870
decided to take a risky trip
to the Lonely Town.

548
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,860
It was once a prosperous town after all.

549
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,320
All those horror stories about that town

550
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,180
didn't seem as daunting

551
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,030
as the threat of death.

552
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,660
Any supplies we could get from there

553
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:11,250
meant a higher chance of survival for us.

554
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,420
They successfully

555
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,150
returned from the Lonely Town.

556
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,180
They brought sufficient supplies back

557
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,310
to support us through the cold winter.

558
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,790
However, little did we know

559
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,790
that it was the start of a nightmare.

560
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,420
Those who visited the Lonely Town

561
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:29,580
went insane one after another.

562
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,940
Just like the rumor had it,

563
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,800
they lost their souls

564
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,600
and humanity,

565
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,310
ending up being monsters.

566
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,380
Every time after they went rogue,

567
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,620
they would pass out.

568
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,820
But once they woke up,
they'd be violent again.

569
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,700
No one knew

570
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,310
how they became like that.

571
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,900
We had no other choice.

572
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,510
So, my brother decided to

573
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,110
lock these people up

574
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,380
in this secret dungeon

575
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,890
when they were unconscious,

576
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:59,090
keeping them out of contact with anyone

577
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,380
till these people

578
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,980
who had turned into monsters

579
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:05,070
starved to death.

580
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:09,900
My brother

581
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,760
was the last one to turn.

582
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:13,690
Sen,

583
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,550
maybe this is unnecessary.

584
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,700
You seem fine to me.

585
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,280
I know my own condition.

586
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,220
You must take good care of

587
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,660
the elderly and the children.

588
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,420
Sen, don't do this.

589
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,510
You are fine.

590
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,140
Let's go.

591
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,140
Sen!

592
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:26,460
Sen!

593
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,110
Leave here now.

594
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:28,700
Sen!

595
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,140
Leave!

596
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:29,380
Sen!

597
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:29,790
Leave!

598
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,110
Sen!

599
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,590
Sen!

600
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:34,510
Sen!

601
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,510
Sen!

602
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,510
Sen!

603
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,220
Sen...

604
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,510
Sen... Sen...

605
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:47,620
Sen...

606
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:54,510
Sen is my only family.

607
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,590
I can't just sit back

608
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,750
and watch him die.

609
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,270
So, after everyone

610
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,460
falls asleep,

611
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,900
I'd secretly thrown him some food.

612
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,100
But when I visited him tonight,

613
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,220
I found that he had broken the chains

614
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,790
and fled from his cage.

615
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,030
I panicked

616
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,260
and chased after him,

617
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,160
but it was too late.

618
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,140
My brother...

619
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,700
already mauled a girl.

620
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,690
What's done cannot be undone.

621
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,410
We must figure out a way

622
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,880
to find your brother now.

623
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,340
Do you have any ideas?

624
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,770
My brother is a huge menace now.

625
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,070
However prominent the problem is,

626
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,330
we must try solving it.

627
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:30,590
Never have we believed

628
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,200
any of that supernatural nonsense.

629
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,620
Your brother
might've changed like you said,

630
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,080
but I'm sure there's a cause for it.

631
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,150
As long as we find the cause,

632
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,810
we'll come up with a solution.

633
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,510
Don't you find

634
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:57,380
Luo Sen's behavior tonight

635
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,530
familiar?

636
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,620
It did seem familiar.

637
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,340
According to
what you and Tong Shuang described,

638
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,490
Luo Sen's crazy acts were identical

639
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:09,020
to Old Bug's before he died.

640
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,350
Look.

641
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,350
His heart

642
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,680
is swollen and deformed

643
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,310
just like Old Bug's.

644
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,030
Old Bug gained immense strength

645
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,030
after taking

646
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,050
a mysterious pill

647
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,320
he cooked for Yesha.

648
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,300
Those Haiya men

649
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:29,740
turned into monsters

650
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,520
after their visit to the Lonely Town.

651
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,870
All their hearts

652
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,130
swelled in the same way.

653
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,620
They also exhibited
a similar pattern of behavior.

654
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,660
There wasn't a tie

655
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,700
between these two groups of people.

656
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,510
How did they end up the same?

657
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,510
It really puzzles me.

658
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,350
Could it be possible that the supplies

659
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,620
Haiya people found

660
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,510
in the Lonely Town
contained Yesha's pills,

661
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:52,350
and that they ate them by mistake?

662
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,180
Who would take an unknown pill?

663
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,380
Besides, the making of such pills

664
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,350
was not finished by Huang Wuchang
until recently.

665
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,790
Those Haiya people turned

666
00:29:58,790 --> 00:29:59,920
at a different time.

667
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,940
If what Luo Shu said is true,

668
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,590
the cause of those people's illness

669
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:05,250
should lie in the Lonely Town.

670
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,260
We still need to find Luo Sen.

671
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,030
If we manage to
bring him back to his senses,

672
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,130
maybe we'll find some clues

673
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,030
from him.

674
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:12,790
After all, among us,

675
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,350
only he has been to the Lonely Town.

676
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,590
But Luo Sen is still delirious now.

677
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,590
We can't just search

678
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,150
the entire forest for him, can we?

679
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,380
Even if we're lucky enough

680
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,270
to find him,

681
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,350
he might go berserk

682
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,410
and hurt us, right?

683
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:25,900
Beiming,

684
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,660
don't keep us in suspense.

685
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,180
Do you have a finding?

686
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,590
After Luo Sen escaped from the dungeon,

687
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:32,650
he bit a girl first,

688
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,180
and then ate meat in the forest.

689
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,630
It means he is very hungry.

690
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:37,460
But since he's not really a beast,

691
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,650
we can set up a trap

692
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,130
and wait for him to emerge.

693
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,380
Where is he? Is he coming here or not?

694
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,670
The chicken is going to be overcooked.

695
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,070
Be patient.

696
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,550
Wipe that drool off your face.

697
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,170
Not after you wipe yours.

698
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,450
There he is.

699
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,620
That's impossible.

700
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,550
I put in enough drug

701
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,940
to knock out two bulls.

702
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,590
How did he manage to stand up?

703
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,940
Be careful.

704
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:12,560
Don't worry.

705
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:12,910
Okay.

706
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,420
Monster!

707
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,320
Come help me!
