[The Wanted Detective]

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,780
[Episode 35]

3
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,509
Where are we going?

4
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,509
Chessboard Alley.

5
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:42,570
Chessboard Alley?

6
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,509
I remember that's where

7
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:45,229
the families
of Ministry of Works officials live.

8
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:45,950
That's right.

9
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:46,640
Chessboard Alley

10
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,950
is just a nickname the locals use.

11
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,280
The people from the Ministry of Works
are so set in their ways

12
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,170
that not only did they build their houses

13
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,430
exactly the same,

14
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,690
[Qiluo Pavilion]

15
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,000
but also lined them up perfectly straight,

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,950
nineteen rows across and lengthwise,

17
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,009
like a chessboard.

18
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:56,120
But why are we there

19
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,120
instead of going
to the Ministry of Justice

20
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,430
to investigate the case?

21
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,200
Because some things

22
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,480
the Ministry of Justice can't handle,

23
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,140
but the Ministry of Works can.

24
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,510
So who exactly are we looking for?

25
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,200
Feng Bamao,

26
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,510
a clerk at the Ministry of Works.

27
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,640
I dealt with him

28
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,840
before the Fengbo Lake case.

29
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,639
He's just a clerk.

30
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,690
How can he help us?

31
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,890
Of course he can.

32
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,960
Because the work he does

33
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,360
is different from most people's.

34
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,630
What kind of work does he do?

35
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,150
Under the Ministry of Works,

36
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,710
there's a small office
called the Office of Rodents and Insects.

37
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,400
They handle

38
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,560
every snake, insect, rat,

39
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,960
and ant problem in the capital.

40
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,030
Most people

41
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,280
don't want the job,

42
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,960
but Feng Bamao is different.

43
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,030
He loves this work,

44
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,240
spending his days with bugs.

45
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,680
No one in the world
can match him in this field.

46
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,000
Spending his days with bugs?

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,870
So strange?

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,930
Strange indeed.

49
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,750
But finding the right person
is what matters.

50
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,490
So the place we're going

51
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,560
is full of bugs.

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
No wonder Zhuge Kongyun

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,280
and Dairong didn't come.

54
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,610
Kongyun is a neat freak.

55
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,280
Huo Dairong was probably terrified

56
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,030
the last time in the underground tomb.

57
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,360
The one who got bitten was me.

58
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,750
If I'd known,
I would've brought some insect repellent.

59
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,280
Let's go.

60
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,630
Stand still!

61
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:13,750
Lift your foot! Lift your foot!

62
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,350
Lift it up.

63
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,280
Lift it.

64
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,360
Easy.

65
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,470
Easy.

66
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,520
You can step on me if you want,

67
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,960
just don't step on it.

68
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,240
What are you looking for?

69
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,800
A very rare black silkworm

70
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,660
from the Kingdom of Mulberry.

71
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,710
-How about we help you find it?
-Don't move!

72
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,190
Get up.

73
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,630
Its skin changes color,

74
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,470
blending perfectly

75
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,800
with its surroundings.

76
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,840
It's extremely sneaky.

77
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,500
Don't move.

78
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,000
If it gets stepped on,

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,040
who knows when

80
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,320
I'll find another one.

81
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,910
Just stand still for now.

82
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,570
Don't move.

83
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,280
Sorry for the poor hospitality.

84
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,200
Don't move.

85
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,070
It's afraid of strong light.

86
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,220
It must be in this room.

87
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,740
But it also hates the dark,

88
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,970
so it won't go into that dark chamber.

89
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,810
It has to still be in this room.

90
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,750
Why are you laughing?

91
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,630
Didn't you say

92
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,159
when faced with a difficult problem,

93
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,190
you should use your brain?

94
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:55,980
So use it.

95
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,310
My little treasure,

96
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,800
you're getting sneakier and sneakier.

97
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,680
In the future, tie a red thread

98
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,720
around its head.

99
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,720
It can change color,

100
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,920
but the thread won't.

101
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,350
That way, if it runs out again,

102
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,550
it'll be easy to spot.

103
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,650
Makes sense.

104
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,920
But using silk spun by its own kind

105
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,600
to tie it up…

106
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,870
isn't that a bit…

107
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,800
Xiao?

108
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,510
How come it's you?

109
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,920
Long time no see, Feng.

110
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,270
I came this time

111
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,470
to ask you for a favor.

112
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,240
You just helped me

113
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,070
with such a big favor.

114
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,360
If there's anything I can do,

115
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,360
just say the word.

116
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,010
I found this

117
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,270
at three crime scenes.

118
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,120
Their bodies

119
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,580
were arranged in a spiral.

120
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,070
You're an expert in this field,

121
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,670
so I'd like you to take a look.

122
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:09,920
These ants

123
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,600
are all showing signs of molting,

124
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,240
which indicates
they were extremely agitated

125
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,560
before death.

126
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,160
Extremely agitated?

127
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,920
That means extremely excited.

128
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,190
To put it bluntly,

129
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,870
they literally excited themselves
to death.

130
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:24,830
Excited to death?

131
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,760
I'm telling you,

132
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,680
I'm a doctor.

133
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,410
Don't try to fool me.

134
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,880
You can heal people,

135
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,510
but can you heal insects?

136
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,830
People can die from excitement,

137
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,040
so can insects.

138
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,010
These insects

139
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,680
must have come into contact with something

140
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,000
before death to end up like this.

141
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,830
You mean…

142
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,290
they were poisoned?

143
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,560
You're sharp.

144
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,800
Someone must have been using

145
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,310
certain substances while these insects

146
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,040
happened to be present,

147
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,800
causing their deaths as collateral damage.

148
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,130
What kind of substance?

149
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,360
I don't know.

150
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,270
It definitely

151
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,510
wasn't a pesticide.

152
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,260
I only specialize in

153
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,150
insecticides.

154
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,270
Alright.

155
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,240
This trip was a waste of time.

156
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,800
We didn't find any clues.

157
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,360
Sir, you speak so bluntly.

158
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,560
Do you look down on me?

159
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,430
Feng, please don't take offense.

160
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,670
He's not good with words.

161
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,600
Just ignore him.

162
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,410
I may not know

163
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,190
the exact poison
that killed these insects,

164
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,160
but I feel like I've seen bugs

165
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,050
die the same way somewhere before.

166
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,040
Where?

167
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,990
My brain isn't working well.

168
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,190
I can't remember right now.

169
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,780
Are you messing with me?

170
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,290
Don't rush.

171
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,800
See this inner room?

172
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,070
It has specimens of all kinds of insects.

173
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,480
For each one, there's a record

174
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,680
of how it died,
what its death looked like,

175
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,600
and where it died.

176
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,480
Let me

177
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,720
go in and check.

178
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,750
Thank you.

179
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,800
There are quite a lot of specimens.

180
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,430
Can anyone help me?

181
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,070
Coroner Feng.

182
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,240
Me?

183
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,160
Yes, yes.

184
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,600
Go.

185
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,750
You already know how to heal people.

186
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,480
If you learn to heal insects too,

187
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,480
you'll reach the pinnacle of medicine.

188
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:21,830
I...

189
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,950
Doctor,

190
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,430
would you help me?

191
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,680
I'm telling you,

192
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,160
insect bodies

193
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,800
are far more interesting
than human bodies.

194
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,200
What are you doing?

195
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,480
I have a few poisonous insects inside.

196
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,320
They will attack my face.

197
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,280
What about me?

198
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,410
You'll be fine.

199
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,370
The one they hate...

200
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,000
is me.

201
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,070
You'll reach the pinnacle of medicine.

202
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,670
How did you get to know this person?

203
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,750
Once, a palace in the capital collapsed,

204
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,680
causing deaths.

205
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,270
The Ministry of Justice thought
the Ministry of Works officials

206
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,200
had cut corners,

207
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,100
so they arrested the supervisor.

208
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,480
I was there at the time
and sensed something was off.

209
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,150
Later, Feng Bamao approached me,

210
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,860
wanting to investigate together.

211
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,790
Isn't he from
the Office of Rodents and Insects?

212
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,790
What does he have to do

213
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,670
with a palace accident?

214
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,910
He believed the collapse

215
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,570
was caused by termite damage,

216
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,480
which was later confirmed.

217
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,500
He seems to be quite selfless.

218
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,960
Not only that,

219
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,000
the supervisor

220
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,480
had previously had conflicts with him,

221
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,150
yet instead of taking advantage,

222
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,550
he helped uncover the truth

223
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,720
and cleared his name.

224
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,850
On this point alone,

225
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,320
he seems reliable.

226
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,000
We have a lead.

227
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,200
It's Yunji Palace.

228
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,550
I once saw

229
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,440
identical dead insects there.

230
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,630
Yunji Palace?

231
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:05,890
Isn't that

232
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,550
where Taoist Yunji lives?

233
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,640
Who is Taoist Yunji?

234
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,600
He's a sorcerer from a foreign land,

235
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,670
skilled in all kinds of magic tricks,

236
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,000
especially illusions.

237
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,010
During festivals,

238
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,140
nobles in the capital

239
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,740
would invite him to perform.

240
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,630
I even invited you to watch once.

241
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,320
I remember.

242
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,620
I couldn't go

243
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,440
because of official duties.

244
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,600
That's a shame.

245
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,080
One year at the Mid-Autumn Festival,

246
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,080
he was invited into the palace

247
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,840
and performed a trick

248
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,510
called "Thousand Miles Landscape"

249
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,840
in front of His Majesty
and all the officials.

250
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,240
He stood alone on the stage,

251
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,240
and with a wave of his hand,

252
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,080
a vision of "Thousand Miles Landscape"

253
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,670
appeared.

254
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,200
Rivers, lakes, towering mountains,

255
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,600
the sun, moon, and stars—

256
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,600
all amidst swirling clouds and mist,

257
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,240
accompanied by faint Buddhist chants.

258
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,000
It was truly magnificent,

259
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,080
absolutely breathtaking.

260
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,080
It seems that

261
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,630
Taoist Yunji's

262
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,150
"Thousand Miles Landscape" trick

263
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,600
bears some resemblance to Yesha's

264
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,130
"Demonized Four Symbols".

265
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,910
If they're

266
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,630
the same kind of tricks,

267
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,360
then finding Taoist Yunji

268
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,280
could help us solve our mystery.

269
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,200
Thanks.

270
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,650
You're welcome.

271
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,390
So this is Yunji Palace?

272
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,460
He's just a mechanical sorcerer.

273
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,660
Do you really think he lives in a palace?

274
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,000
That's right.

275
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,440
Why are you here?

276
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,440
For trivial matters like finding bugs,

277
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,390
you're fine.

278
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,300
Catching people is my specialty.

279
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,010
Maybe there are bugs in there too.

280
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,480
Alright.

281
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,510
Enough joking.

282
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,970
Let's go in and take a look.

283
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,000
No one's here.

284
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,270
Judging by the dust,

285
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,510
it's been some days.

286
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:49,030
There are clear signs of a struggle.

287
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,780
He didn't leave on his own;

288
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,960
he was taken.

289
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,080
It must have been Yesha.

290
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,550
He took Taoist Yunji

291
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,700
probably to use

292
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:57,860
his illusion skills

293
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,960
to stage
the Case of the Demonized Four Symbols.

294
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,840
So we're late again?

295
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,080
He could take him,

296
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,200
but not necessarily

297
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,080
everything.

298
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,910
Let's split up

299
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,000
and see if we can find any clues.

300
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:12,150
[Unpredictable Changes]

301
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,270
I'll search outside.

302
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:08,790
Okay.

303
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,120
Look.

304
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,930
There are dead insects.

305
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,750
Two locks?

306
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,170
Perfect chance.

307
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,440
Let's have a competition

308
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,370
to see who can pick the lock faster.

309
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,440
Stop it.

310
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,300
It must be tung oil in this barrel.

311
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,340
This is probably what we're looking for.

312
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,360
What is this thing?

313
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,320
I know now.

314
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,240
What?

315
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,630
Bosuo Flower.

316
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,320
There are scattered petals

317
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,600
of Bosuo Flowers all over the yard,

318
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,120
though the blooms have been picked.

319
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,360
But I still found

320
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,690
their seeds in the soil.

321
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,960
Bosuo Flower?

322
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,510
I've never

323
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,980
heard of them before.

324
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,360
Have you?

325
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,670
Then why aren't you surprised?

326
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,530
You're so calm.

327
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,550
I'm used to it.

328
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,200
He often talks about things

329
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,360
that are hard to understand.

330
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,320
Quickly, explain—

331
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,150
what are Bosuo Flowers?

332
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:00,360
Bosuo Flowers
are plants from foreign lands.

333
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,550
According to Yin-Yang Book,

334
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,910
if you grind and refine

335
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,750
their flowers and seeds into powder,

336
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,150
it can become a medicine.

337
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,180
What medicine?

338
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,600
A sedative.

339
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,530
It's non-toxic.

340
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,510
When inhaled by humans,

341
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,000
it causes dullness of consciousness

342
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,270
and numbing of the five senses.

343
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,160
The numbness

344
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,150
doesn't last long,

345
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,440
so it's hard to detect.

346
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,200
But if insects come into contact with it,

347
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,480
they die instantly.

348
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,150
I'm now certain

349
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,910
that there was a large amount
of Bosuo Flower pollen

350
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:25,980
at the crime scene.

351
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,120
This is the key to the illusion technique.

352
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,480
The Bosuo Flower pollen

353
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,430
is only an aid to make viewers

354
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,530
more immersed

355
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,600
in the illusion.

356
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,480
That's right.

357
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,360
By itself,

358
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,960
it cannot create illusions.

359
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,670
Let's take all these things back

360
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,810
and see if we can find

361
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:41,890
anything crucial.

362
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,000
Bosuo Flowers appeared

363
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,460
at all three crime scenes.

364
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,360
But if you wanted everyone present

365
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,290
to experience dull consciousness

366
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,440
and numbed senses,

367
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,360
the few at Yunji Palace

368
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,910
wouldn't be nearly enough.

369
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,630
Qi Kingdom
doesn't grow this kind of plant.

370
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,390
If a large quantity
of Bosuo Flowers is needed,

371
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,510
they must be transported
from the Western Regions.

372
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,370
In the capital,

373
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,670
the trading houses Xilaigui and Liluxi

374
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,480
specialize in goods

375
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,840
from the West.

376
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,150
I'll check and see

377
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,630
if I can trace the source

378
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,850
and find some clues.

379
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,270
Such things

380
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,790
might also be sold at the Ghost Market.

381
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,920
We can go look there.

382
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,360
Okay.

383
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,000
Then I'll stay here with Coroner Feng

384
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,440
to continue investigating
the secrets of this illusion technique.

385
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,510
Let's split up.

386
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,080
Be careful.

387
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,390
I don't know.

388
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:35,820
[Talc] [Soda Ash] [Alum][Fragrant Bone]

389
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,530
[Tung Oil]

390
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,310
[Lime] [Charcoal Powder]

391
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,640
[Talc] [Green vitriol] [Fragrant Bone]

392
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,120
I'll talk!

393
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,960
I'll tell you everything!

394
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,840
Jiuxiao powder.

395
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,270
The owners of the two trading houses
confessed.

396
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,790
Someone recently purchased
a large quantity

397
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,690
of Bosuo Flowers from them

398
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,820
at a very high price.

399
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,790
Who was it?

400
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,550
Did they see the person?

401
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,470
The buyer is extremely cautious

402
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,720
and has never shown their face.

403
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,060
Their method of payment

404
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,720
is like that
of a traveling theater troupe.

405
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,530
A box of gold and silver

406
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,960
suddenly appeared in front of the shop.

407
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,680
As the saying goes, "Men die for wealth,

408
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,810
birds die for food."

409
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,960
Though they sensed

410
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,030
something suspicious,

411
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,030
the lure of great profit
was enough for them to take the risk.

412
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,589
At first, they were unwilling to speak,

413
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:19,589
probably because

414
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:20,589
they feared being implicated

415
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:21,619
in other cases.

416
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,810
So how did the transaction take place?

417
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,069
With so many flowers,

418
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:26,470
how did they manage them?

419
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,540
There was an instruction in the box

420
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,400
telling them to deliver the flowers

421
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,960
to a courtyard in the north of the city.

422
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,790
Did you check it out?

423
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,430
Of course.

424
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,480
But we were still a step too late.

425
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,200
By the time Li Long and Fang Yin arrived,

426
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,050
the courtyard

427
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,140
was empty,

428
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,110
leaving only

429
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,510
a few Bosuo Flower leaves.

430
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,000
This only proves
that the trading house owners

431
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,880
weren't lying.

432
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,250
It seems he had already prepared for this.

433
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,570
The clues we have now

434
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,400
are too few.

435
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,790
I'm afraid it will get even harder

436
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,920
to investigate later.

437
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,780
I actually managed to find some

438
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,980
useful information.

439
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,000
You found leads at the Ghost Market?

440
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,530
Although

441
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,160
there's no seller of Bosuo Flowers there,

442
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,440
we found that recently

443
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,440
someone transported a large quantity
of Bosuo Flowers

444
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,570
to the Ghost Market.

445
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,830
Why did they transport them
to the Ghost Market?

446
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,880
It's probably to refine them into powder.

447
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,750
I see.

448
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,150
Refining Bosuo Flower powder
isn't difficult.

449
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:07,780
But refining

450
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,060
such a large amount of it

451
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,270
isn't easy.

452
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,270
If it were done openly,

453
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,110
the unique effects of the Bosuo Flower

454
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,070
would attract

455
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,720
many insects during the process,

456
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,550
making it easy

457
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,510
for us to notice.

458
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,680
That's why

459
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,310
they placed a large amount
of Bosuo Flower powder

460
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,880
in the pharmacies in the Ghost Market.

461
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,640
Exactly.

462
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,790
The pharmacies in the Ghost Market

463
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,880
are meant for refining

464
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,240
forbidden and highly toxic substances.

465
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,920
They strictly follow
the Ghost Market rules—

466
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,930
never asking about the source

467
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:31,720
or the purpose.

468
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,080
So, sending the Bosuo Flowers there

469
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,240
for processing is both the safest

470
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,160
and most secure option.

471
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,090
Let's go to my place

472
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,540
and see if we can find

473
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,890
any other useful clues.

474
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,220
Since the people in the Ghost Market

475
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,270
are so rule-abiding,

476
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,730
what have you discovered?

477
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,440
Even the most rule-abiding people
fear death.

478
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,970
Unlike the trading houses,

479
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,510
the powders in the Ghost Market pharmacies

480
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,590
were collected
by someone specifically assigned.

481
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,240
Someone specifically assigned?

482
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,490
Everyone entering the Ghost Market

483
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:56,720
must cover their faces.

484
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,830
But the pharmacy staff said

485
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:58,850
the person who collected the powders
had a left hand

486
00:18:58,850 --> 00:18:59,720
that was very limited in movement.

487
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,790
It was wrapped in bandages

488
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,590
and looked as if it were injured.

489
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,310
Someone with their left hand bandaged?

490
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,180
I believe he must be

491
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,240
one of Yesha's men.

492
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,430
But this clue is too broad

493
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,960
to point to anyone specific.

494
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,290
Still, something is better than nothing.

495
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,720
Indeed.

496
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,970
I'll send people
to investigate right away.

497
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,320
Oh, right.

498
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,450
How's your investigation into

499
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,720
Taoist Yunji's belongings going?

500
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,200
It's all

501
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,480
a jumble of things.

502
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,680
There's even sugar.

503
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,880
We really can't make

504
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,830
anything out.

505
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,500
Where's my senior?

506
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,070
He hasn't found any clues,

507
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,240
so he went out for a walk

508
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,640
and hasn't returned yet.

509
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,540
[11 PM]

510
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:32,040
[1 AM][3 AM][5 AM]

511
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,800
He's been gone for two hours.

512
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,200
I need to find him.

513
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:36,850
Follow me.

514
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,010
Where have you been?

515
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,200
These are the three crime scenes

516
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,350
of the Four Symbols case.

517
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:52,960
Beiming,

518
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,590
did you discover something?

519
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:57,720
I've uncovered the secret
behind the Four Symbols case.

520
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,380
[Peace]

521
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,650
Bosuo Flowers.

522
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
When inhaled by humans,

523
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,310
it causes dullness of consciousness

524
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,400
and numbing of the five senses.

525
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,110
But if insects come into contact with it,

526
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,400
they die instantly.

527
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:15,110
So intricate.

528
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,740
It's absolutely mind-boggling.

529
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,040
If the method you described

530
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,170
really works,

531
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,160
then next,

532
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,500
he will surely use it

533
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:24,680
to commit the Black Tortoise case.

534
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,010
So when and where

535
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,230
will he strike again?

536
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,200
Here,

537
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:36,550
and here.

538
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,920
According to my analysis,

539
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,640
there are only a few places

540
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,240
where the final Black Tortoise case

541
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,640
could take place.

542
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:58,160
The Heaven Worship Ceremony is tomorrow?

543
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,560
Why hold it at such a time?

544
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,590
Won't that only make things more chaotic?

545
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,050
I understand His Majesty.

546
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,020
The people of Qi Kingdom are in panic.

547
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,790
Rumors that the kingdom will fall

548
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,030
and divine punishment is coming

549
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,440
are spreading like wildfire.

550
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,720
Qi Kingdom
is in a state of fear and paranoia.

551
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,400
If His Majesty
doesn't calm the people soon,

552
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,200
the situation will only worsen.

553
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,000
That's right.

554
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,110
This is our only option.

555
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,160
Previously,
preparing for a Heaven Worship Ceremony

556
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,070
took the Ministry of Rites

557
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,440
several months.

558
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,920
Given the current situation,

559
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,550
His Majesty wants it done
as quickly as possible.

560
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:27,110
We can only choose a nearby auspicious day

561
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,310
and handle it simply.

562
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,350
Where will the ceremony be held?

563
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,750
At the Heaven Worship Altar, of course.

564
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,350
Now we know

565
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,780
when and where he plans

566
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,710
to commit the Black Tortoise case.

567
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,020
Everything happening right now

568
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,370
is part of his plan.

569
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,750
Demonized Four Symbols,

570
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,160
with each step linked to the next,

571
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,360
is truly terrifying.

572
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,810
But what is his goal

573
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,680
in doing all this?

574
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,240
The Heaven Worship Ceremony
is a grand ritual.

575
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,420
His Majesty, the officials,

576
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,850
[Honest, Wise, Magnanimous, Insightful]

577
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,710
and the imperial family will all attend.

578
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,600
His goal couldn't be...

579
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,640
To use this case

580
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,850
to make the officials—and even His Majesty
—of Qi Kingdom

581
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,000
take the Swift Wind Pill,

582
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,480
turning them into monsters
in front of the people.

583
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,790
Then he could,
under the guise of divine punishment,

584
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:11,070
easily seize control of all of Qi Kingdom.

585
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:11,960
If that's really the case,

586
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,320
we must enter the palace immediately

587
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,030
and ask His Majesty
to cancel the ceremony.

588
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:15,920
It's too late.

589
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
The imperial edict
has already been issued.

590
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:20,940
[Honest, Wise, Magnanimous, Insightful]

591
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,110
If it were withdrawn,

592
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,240
the people would only think

593
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,240
His Majesty is afraid

594
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,100
of this so-called will of heaven.

595
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:24,160
Rumors would spread even more,

596
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,400
potentially shaking

597
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,270
the very foundation of Qi Kingdom.

598
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,880
That would be far too dangerous.

599
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,010
If Yesha really poisons the ceremony,

600
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,670
how can we defend against it?

601
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,360
Although I still haven't found

602
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,290
an antidote to the Swift Wind Pill,

603
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,320
no one understands its toxicity

604
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,910
better than I do.

605
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,590
These are bamboo sticks

606
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,110
soaked in a special solution I prepared.

607
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,680
They can't neutralize the poison,

608
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,000
but when they come into contact
with the Swift Wind Pill,

609
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,830
they turn black,

610
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,640
offering a degree of protection.

611
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,400
Chiefs, please enter the palace at once

612
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,350
and inform His Majesty
of the seriousness of the situation,

613
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,310
then distribute these sticks

614
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,330
to the palace personnel

615
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:55,310
and officials,

616
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,790
asking them to carefully check

617
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,100
all food and drink

618
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,510
before consuming anything.

619
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,620
But what if tomorrow

620
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,810
the Black Tortoise illusion

621
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,070
really occurs

622
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,800
and deceives the people again?

623
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,610
We won't give him another chance.

624
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,750
Hail the deity!

625
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:13,750
We respectfully invite the Heavenly Emperor
to descend and receive the offerings!

626
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,680
Bow!

627
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,230
Rise!

628
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,030
First offering: jade and silk!

629
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,270
Bow!

630
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,310
Rise!

631
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,030
Second offering: grains!

632
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,440
Bow!

633
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,310
Rise!

634
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:58,750
Final offering: wine and food!

635
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,030
Ceremony complete!

636
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,200
Heavenly Emperor, please manifest

637
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:07,160
and bless Qi Kingdom.

638
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,510
The emperor of Qi Kingdom is unjust.

639
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,830
Heaven has abandoned him.

640
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:15,480
Submitting to the new ruler

641
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,070
is what aligns with the will of Heaven!

642
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,480
The emperor of Qi Kingdom is unjust.

643
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:23,910
He really came.

644
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:26,650
Submitting to the new ruler

645
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,260
is what aligns with the will of Heaven.

646
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,470
The emperor of Qi Kingdom is unjust.

647
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,080
Heaven has abandoned him.

648
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,030
Submitting to the new ruler...

649
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,400
Where is Xiao Beiming?

650
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,860
Why has it gone silent?

651
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,420
Is it just this thing?

652
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,310
Foreign lands really do have

653
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,400
quite a few strange things.

654
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,610
Through this thing,

655
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,460
the so-called

656
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,610
divine beasts' decrees

657
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,070
can be spread into the sky?

658
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,200
What's going on?

659
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,350
What's happening?

660
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,480
I have no idea.

661
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,160
I'll go out and check.

662
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,640
Okay.

663
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,300
Don't move if you want to live.

664
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:26,910
Step back.

665
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,240
Beiming, you were right.

666
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,640
My Lords,

667
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,240
I'm not with him.

668
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,550
I was forced into cooperation

669
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,920
after he captured me.

670
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,220
So you're Taoist Yunji?

671
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,700
Yes, that's me.

672
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:43,880
Taoist Yunji.

673
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,240
We know you were coerced,

674
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,510
but the situation is urgent.

675
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,840
There's something we need your help with.

676
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,880
The demons have been vanquished!

677
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,480
Yesha has been slain!

678
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,880
Heaven's will returns to Qi Kingdom!

679
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,650
It will bless us!

680
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:07,380
The demons have been vanquished!

681
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,030
Yesha has been slain!

682
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,270
Heaven's will returns to Qi Kingdom!

683
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,710
It will bless us!

684
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:19,110
Heaven bless Qi Kingdom!

685
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,750
Turning the plan against him?

686
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,500
He's quite something.

687
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,400
It worked.

688
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,700
"Heaven's will returns to Qi Kingdom.
It will bless us."

689
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,500
Didn't expect you to be so brave.

690
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,860
[One day ago]

691
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,440
What does this mean?

692
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,760
This is the method
of creating images with fire

693
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,880
recorded in the Book of Mechanics.

694
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,550
By using a dark room and light,

695
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,920
you can produce phantom illusions.

696
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,400
This is one of the methods

697
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,400
used in the Four Symbols case,

698
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,240
and the most crucial one.

699
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,640
You mean

700
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,640
the divine beasts that appeared in the sky

701
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,160
were illusions, just like

702
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,550
the candle's reflection?

703
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,790
But the divine beasts

704
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,000
are so different

705
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,240
from the reflections in the sky.

706
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:12,340
[Honest, Wise, Magnanimous, Insightful]

707
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,680
Could Yesha

708
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,510
have hung a cloth in the sky?

709
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:13,750
Exactly.

710
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,400
That cloth

711
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,270
is the clouds in the sky.

712
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,350
You mean

713
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,270
those divine beasts

714
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,200
were actually projected

715
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,130
onto the clouds?

716
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:21,830
Then where did

717
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,160
those clouds come from?

718
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,270
They were created

719
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,510
by Taoist Yunji

720
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:28,040
using the substances
in his jars and bottles.

721
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,270
Celestial stone powder and sugar?

722
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:35,920
Exactly.

723
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,110
By using celestial stone powder
and sugar as the main ingredients,

724
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,880
then mixing in various pigments,

725
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,740
one could produce colored smoke.

726
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,390
Adding crystal powder to the mix

727
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,030
would allow the clouds

728
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,630
to reflect light and shadow.

729
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,480
Most importantly,

730
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,650
they included

731
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:51,920
a large amount of Bosuo Flower pollen.

732
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,400
Once the clouds rose into the sky,

733
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,000
the pollen would drift down,

734
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:55,940
and the onlookers—

735
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,110
unaware—

736
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,480
would have their five senses numbed,

737
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,680
making them more likely to believe

738
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,140
the illusion before them.

739
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,830
But even if he could make those clouds,

740
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,510
they weren't solid objects.

741
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:06,600
How could he carry them around

742
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,030
and use them at will?

743
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,090
Of course he could.

744
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,180
In Yunji Palace,

745
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:10,750
we found large quantities

746
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,210
of silk cloth and tung oil.

747
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:14,310
When the silk was soaked in tung oil,

748
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,570
it became waterproof.

749
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,070
By sewing them together,

750
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:19,680
they could make so-called
oil-silk pouches.

751
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,650
Then he put the drug powders

752
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:21,640
inside these pouches,

753
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,160
and when needed, opening them

754
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,310
would release

755
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,370
the colored smoke.

756
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,680
Using this method,

757
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,510
whether for the illusion chambers

758
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,750
or the drifting clouds,

759
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,660
the setup would have to be deployed

760
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,590
from a height to work effectively.

761
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,480
Follow me.

762
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,720
Both the street
where the White Tiger case took place

763
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,160
and the execution ground
of the Azure Dragon case

764
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:47,430
[Tranquility]

765
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,880
happened to have watchtowers nearby.

766
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,590
These watchtowers are meant
for city defense

767
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,110
and are not used in peacetime.

768
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,720
I believe that, at the time,

769
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:53,690
Yesha's men were hiding atop

770
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:54,740
that watchtower.

771
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,080
Then how do you explain the injuries

772
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,830
on Wu Zhui and Wu Lie's bodies?

773
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,770
Of course, they were faked.

774
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,720
The bite and claw marks

775
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,960
on their bodies

776
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,510
were deliberately made

777
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:07,070
using the fangs of wild beasts.

778
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:09,350
If Wu Zhui
had really died in a tiger's jaws,

779
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:11,570
his body would show marks

780
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,400
from the tiger's tongue scraping him,

781
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,240
and his corpse

782
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,160
would have been dull and yellowed.

783
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,400
Once the bodies are returned,

784
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,340
I want you to re-examine

785
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,870
Wu Zhui and Wu Lie's bodies.

786
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,310
You want me to perform an autopsy?

787
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,550
The Four Symbols killings
never actually happened.

788
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,750
It's all nonsense.

789
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,870
We must have missed

790
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:28,960
some crucial clue.

791
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,510
During the original examination,

792
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:32,310
Feng Qingzhuo was misled by the illusion
and jumped to conclusions,

793
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,570
so he didn't notice it.

794
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,510
That was my oversight.

795
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,900
We were also deceived

796
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:37,830
by Yesha at the time.

797
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,270
Fortunately,
we discovered it before it was too late.

798
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,290
But how did he manage

799
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,350
to escape riding a dragon?

800
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,400
I had Fang Yin investigate the executioner

801
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,550
from that day,

802
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,350
only to find he had been missing
for several days.

803
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,000
I suspect

804
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,110
he was either bribed by Yesha

805
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,240
or already dead.

806
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,160
Moreover,
the execution blade used that day

807
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,310
was fake.

808
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,030
Smoke filled the stage,

809
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,510
and while everyone's attention

810
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:56,240
was drawn to the Azure Dragon in the sky,

811
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,480
Yesha changed his appearance,

812
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,550
left behind the shackles,

813
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,080
and blended into the crowd.

814
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,140
That explains everything.

815
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,200
No, that's not right.

816
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:10,870
[Honest, Wise, Magnanimous, Insightful]

817
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,200
This method could indeed work for

818
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,340
the Azure Dragon and White Tiger cases,

819
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,270
but the Vermilion Bird case is different.

820
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,750
It happened in Feng Prison,
a Heavenly Prison.

821
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,310
This method definitely wouldn't work.

822
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:18,000
Besides,
I fought with the Vermilion Bird myself.

823
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,100
If it were just a phantom,

824
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,030
I would have noticed

825
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,000
immediately.

826
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,440
As I just said,

827
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,830
this is only one method

828
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,350
used in the Four Symbols case.

829
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,350
The Vermilion Bird case

830
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,680
employs a different technique

831
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,740
from the other two.

832
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,110
What do you mean?

833
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,140
The author of this book

834
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,490
was obsessed
with magical arts and illusions.

835
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:38,790
[The Complete Collection of Magical Arts]

836
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,030
He recorded all the strange phenomena
and wonders

837
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,360
he witnessed in his lifetime in this book.

838
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,880
Although he didn't know the key methods,

839
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,440
I found clues

840
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,710
in his descriptions.

841
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:47,860
What does it say?

842
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,720
This book records

843
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,200
the lifelong mastery

844
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,790
of Taoist Yunji.

845
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,030
His "Thousand Miles Landscape"

846
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,310
was created using the method

847
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,270
I mentioned earlier.

848
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,100
But Taoist Yunji

849
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,480
had another ultimate skill

850
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,680
called Mind Control.

851
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,310

It's a hypnotism

will only remember

864
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,710
what they were commanded to remember.

865
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,110
The greatest use of Bosuo Flowers

866
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,030
lies in this.

867
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,400
Are you saying

868
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,000
I was under Mind Control at that time?

869
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,360
The Heavenly Prison was built underground,

870
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,360
with each level's vents

871
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,360
leading straight to the surface.

872
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,710
These vents are extremely narrow.

873
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,510
Only insects can pass through them,

874
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,370
so no one pays them any attention.

875
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,550
But the Bosuo Flower pollen

876
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:33,880
could travel through these vents

877
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,340
all the way to the lowest level
of the prison.

878
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,810
The prison was sealed,

879
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,620
so inhaling

880
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:40,480
a large amount of Bosuo Flower pollen

881
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,210
in a short time would likely do more

882
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:42,690
than just numb the senses;

883
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,360
it would blur one's consciousness.

884
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,880
I suspect that at the time,
it wasn't just you—

885
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,030
Tiangang and Disha, the two top experts,

886
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,000
and even Wu Lie,

887
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,290
were all affected.

888
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,469
But how exactly

889
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,480
did we fall victim to it?

00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,550
some repeated actions or sounds

893
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,230
to subtly

894
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,320
trap a person.

895
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,410
For example...

896
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,190
When you faint,

897
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,190
someone will come to save you.

898
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,330
So that day,

899
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:03,630
all my memories of the Vermilion Bird

900
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,920
were fabricated?

901
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,920
My mind was being controlled?

902
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,980
After you fainted,

903
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,110
Zhuge Kongyun and I also arrived.

904
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,370
Although we were late,

905
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,530
we still noticed

906
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,950
some oddities about you.

907
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,710
You said you entered the fire

908
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,230
and were knocked out
by the Vermilion Bird.

909
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,590
Zhuge Kongyun and I also went in,

910
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,120
but we didn't see anything.

911
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:22,190
The entire Buddhist hall was made of wood.

912
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,440
After the fire,

913
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,320
our shoe soles

914
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,800
were coated with some ash,

915
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,860
but yours were completely clean.

916
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,650
Moreover, there was

917
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:30,210
no trace of smoke on you.

918
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,420
You claimed to have been knocked out

919
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,750
by flames expelled by the Vermilion Bird,

920
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,630
yet not a single strand of your hair

921
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,630
was singed or curled from the heat.

922
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,960
All of this proves that

923
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,600
you never entered the fire,

924
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,880
nor did you see
the so-called Vermilion Bird.

925
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,070
In other words,

926
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:47,010
the Vermilion Bird murder

927
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,710
was just a false memory implanted in me

928
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,960
through his control?

929
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:50,710
Making you

930
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,920
the sole witness

931
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,880
was his goal.

932
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,280
The so-called Demonized Four Symbols

933
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,060
is nothing more than

934
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,190
an illusion created

935
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,720
using unorthodox methods.

936
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,220
Now that we've uncovered

937
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,430
all his methods,

938
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:05,010
the final Black Tortoise case...

939
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,670
We will certainly stop him.

940
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:11,230
That's enough.

941
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:11,760
Thank you.

942
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,400
You were the one
who bought the Bosuo Flower pollen

943
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,230
in the Ghost Market, weren't you?

944
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,430
He trusts you so much.

945
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,880
So let me see

946
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,810
your true face.

947
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,670

948
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:23,360
Beiming,

949
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,440
you know him?

950
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,320
Remember what I told you

951
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,590
about Feng Bamao?

952
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,440
He's the supervisor

953
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,480
who was taken to take the blame.

954
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,710
Your hand

955
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,190
was injured during

956
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:35,390
the Ministry of Justice's
forced confession, wasn't it?

957
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,960
I didn't expect you to remember me.

958
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,130
You're also an orphan from Haiya?

959
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:40,930
That's right.

960
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,030
Back then, my foster parents

961
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,110
sold me into the palace,

962
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,710
and I almost became a eunuch.

963
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,840
By a twist of fate,
I ended up in the Ministry of Works.

964
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,100
I didn't expect the world to be so unjust.

965
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:52,070
Just because of some termites,

966
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,030
my left hand was crippled.

967
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,000
Fortunately,

968
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,630
I met Master then.

969
00:37:59,110 --> 00:37:59,920
Where is he?

970
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,840
Tell me,

971
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,840
and I'll make sure you survive.

972
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,150
Survive?

973
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,510
Do you think

974
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,910
I would betray Master

975
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,320
for my own life?

976
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,000
Your show is over.

977
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:12,010
Sooner or later, we'll catch him.

978
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,960
Over?

979
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,520
You think solving the Four Symbols case

980
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,760
will stop Qi Kingdom from falling?

981
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,590
Xueman!

982
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:35,810
We can't catch up.

983
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,280
It's the Swift Wind Pill.

984
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,500
These must have been prepared

985
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,360
for His Majesty
and the officials during the sacrifice.

986
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,880
This time we stopped him.

987
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,400
But once the Four Symbols case is solved,

988
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,710
if they get desperate

989
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,590
and start spreading poison
throughout the capital,

990
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:00,440
we won't be able to defend against it.

991
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,760
I might know

992
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,920
where they are now.

993
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,320
It's where

994
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,000
I was imprisoned before.
