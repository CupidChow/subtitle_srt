1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,920
大家一定要不要放棄

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,440
Shufeng,

3
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,720
when is your own mission?

4
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,800
White Dragon.

5
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,840
Deputy Chief.

6
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,680
So what happened that day?

7
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,000
Do you know which side Zhu Yuheng went to?

8
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,760
Why are you here?

9
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,000
I have a new mission.

10
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,760
It'll be fine soon after you recover.

11
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,760
Junior.

12
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,040
I can see it.

13
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,280
You're too dangerous this time.

14
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,320
If it weren't for Tong Shuang

15
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,440
when he went to find Feng Jingzhuo,

16
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,880
I wouldn't even know

17
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,320
how to save you.

18
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,040
But your body...

19
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,320
My body is fine now.

20
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,120
If you don't believe me,

21
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,240
touch it.

22
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,960
Is it different from the temperature in Chang'an?

23
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,480
Although we didn't get the fire silk,

24
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,880
at least we know

25
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,040
who is holding it.

26
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,000
As long as we have the fire silk,

27
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,520
we can detoxify it.

28
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,480
By the way, Feng Wuzuo.

29
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,240
Do you know the old man

30
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,320
we met in the ghost city?

31
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,160
No.

32
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,360
Then why did he do that to us?

33
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,400
He...

34
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,720
In the ghost city,

35
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,800
most of them are the evil ones.

36
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,840
They are evil in their hearts.

37
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,320
So they do nothing bad.

38
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,480
That's right.

39
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,480
He wanted your eyes when he came up.

40
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,960
He's not a good person at first sight.

41
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,040
Junior.

42
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,160
You and your girlfriend

43
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,880
dare to use your eyes to exchange for the wind?

44
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,800
Although so,

45
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,240
he didn't really want my eyes.

46
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,240
Feng Wuzuo.

47
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,360
Are you sure you really don't know him?

48
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,960
I really don't know him.

49
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,200
I saw the poison in his hands.

50
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,640
So I wanted to stop him.

51
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,240
But I'm not good at martial arts.

52
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,560
I couldn't stop him.

53
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,480
Luckily, you came in time.

54
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,040
Otherwise, today,

55
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,320
it's all my fault.

56
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,160
I shouldn't have taken you to the ghost city.

57
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,000
I insisted on going.

58
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,120
Not your fault.

59
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,640
Miss, it's late.

60
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,440
It's time to rest.

61
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,320
What's wrong, Miss?

62
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,720
Qingying.

63
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,080
Tomorrow morning,

64
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,360
go to find Zhong Xue for me.

65
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,200
Yes.

66
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,760
Stone House

67
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,440
You know GuiBea?

68
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,360
You know everything.

69
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,360
She's from A rebooting valley.

70
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,400
He's cambium herbophax.

71
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,880
The one I took as my teacher.

72
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,200
No wonder you could do so much to save you.

73
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,160
맞아요 overlap is connected to our case.

74
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,520
What?

75
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,400
I just want to warn you before you faint.

76
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,120
The one who bought the

77
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,080
liver mean really cheating.

78
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,880
It's because I remember

79
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,760
he got the contact plumeria clearly on the aid book.

80
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,320
Aid book?

81
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,120
My master's life experience is recorded in the Yin Yang Book.

82
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,800
He left it to my master before he passed away.

83
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,600
Master.

84
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,200
Master, when did you call me to the Yin Yang Book?

85
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,120
This is a painful experience.

86
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,120
Do you remember?

87
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,440
The reason he killed my master

88
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,440
was to steal the Yin Yang Book.

89
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,040
But my master had already left the Yin Yang Book to me.

90
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,040
So, Old Shou Chong failed to get it.

91
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,040
So,

92
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,240
the Chijing is related to your Poisonous Bone?

93
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,040
When I found the Chijing in the body of the medicine,

94
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,040
I suspected it was related to Poisonous Bone.

95
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,240
But the training process of Chijing is very complicated.

96
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,040
It's not impossible to be a master.

97
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,440
Even I can't practice it.

98
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,240
And only Old Shou Chong can practice Poisonous Bone now.

99
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,840
I can't tell you the truth.

100
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,840
Then Old Shou Chong may be related to the Night Fiend.

101
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,840
Old Shou Chong is a bad person.

102
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,840
He can do anything.

103
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,840
It's a pity that

104
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,840
he ran away last night.

105
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,840
As long as he is still in the capital,

106
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,840
we will have a chance to find him.

107
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,840
Don't you plan to tell them about your identity?

108
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,840
I'm not a good person.

109
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,840
I'm just a good person.

110
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,840
What good people can come out of Poisonous Bone?

111
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,840
Aren't you a good person?

112
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,840
Not everyone thinks like you.

113
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,840
The trust between people

114
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,840
is hard to build.

115
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,840
And it's easy to dissipate.

116
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,840
I don't want everyone to misunderstand.

117
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,440
But paper can never cover fire.

118
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,440
If one day they find out your identity,

119
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,440
the misunderstanding may be deeper.

120
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,440
Let me think about it.

121
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,440
Miss Huo, you are...

122
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,440
The case of Jia Ci is in the deep.

123
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,440
It was supposed to be a trial.

124
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,440
This time, it can be a pre-courtsy trial.

125
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,440
It's all up to the help of the Divine Department.

126
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,440
If this meal is not enough,

127
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,440
I will feel bad.

128
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,040
The dead are the greatest.

129
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,040
You are welcome, Miss Huo.

130
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,040
But you asked me here today

131
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,040
not just for a meal, right?

132
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,040
Just tell me.

133
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,040
There is something.

134
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,440
Please take a look.

135
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,440
The account book of the Huo family.

136
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,040
This account book

137
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,440
was managed by Miss Huo and Li Xiao.

138
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,440
Now I have it.

139
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,440
When I was sorting the accounts,

140
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,440
I found some strange things.

141
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,640
The account book of the Huo family has problems.

142
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,640
I have to check it.

143
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,640
I have to check it.

144
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,640
I have to check it.

145
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,640
I have to check it.

146
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,640
I have to check it.

147
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,640
I have to check it.

148
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,840
Why do you want to see me

149
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,840
when your account is not good?

150
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,840
Every half year,

151
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:56,960
there will be a big

152
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,760
romance between мне and me.

153
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,760
But in fact I sigh now.

154
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,000
Do you think

155
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,840
Miss Huo took away one step

156
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,840
to Res entity?

157
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,160
I want to ask you,

158
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,760
what happened

159
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,120
to hullulong palette and pictures?

160
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,400
Diese UK

161
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,240
and the other.

162
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,160
My father died.

163
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,800
My mother died too.

164
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,840
I want to find out my identity.

165
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,720
This is the only clue

166
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,080
I can find.

167
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,480
Maybe

168
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,280
Master Chu can help me solve the problem.

169
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,240
But I don't know Master Chu.

170
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,000
I don't know anything about Guang Sha Villa.

171
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,600
If I go there rashly,

172
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,320
he might suspect me.

173
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,280
So I want to ask Zhong Bu Kui for help.

174
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,640
Help me find out my identity as soon as possible.

175
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,240
Two buns.

176
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,800
Okay.

177
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,760
Take it.

178
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,920
Thank you for saving me yesterday.

179
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,280
I didn't expect you to be so brave

180
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,680
and dare to go to the ghost town.

181
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,280
I'm sorry.

182
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,160
I didn't expect you to be so brave

183
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,320
and dare to go to the ghost town.

184
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,800
I promised Brother Xiao to save him.

185
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,120
I promised him

186
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,080
that I would do it with all my life.

187
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,160
That girl,

188
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,400
the middle school students,

189
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,800
are you really willing to give up your eyes

190
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,040
for Huo Chan?

191
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,880
That's a chance to save Brother Xiao.

192
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,320
He won't give up.

193
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,120
But he treated Brother Xiao like that before.

194
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,480
Their relationship

195
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,600
is not something ordinary people can understand.

196
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,160
Not to mention an eye,

197
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,960
even if it's a life,

198
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,880
I don't think he will refuse.

199
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,040
Mr. Feng.

200
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,640
Well...

201
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,960
I pushed you that day

202
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,520
and I was angry at you.

203
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,280
Can you hit me?

204
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,800
Let's settle it, okay?

205
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,360
Okay.

206
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:04,840
I hit you.

207
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,400
But it's still me.

208
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,720
What's the difference between

209
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,520
my flesh and mine?

210
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,360
Can I hit you?

211
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,880
Then you cut it with a knife.

212
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:12,960
I don't want it.

213
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,240
You!

214
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,200
Call me Feng in the future.

215
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,160
Call me Feng.

216
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,200
I'm not used to it.

217
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:18,960
Feng,

218
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,120
do you have a good ear for this?

219
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,280
I checked the ledger carefully.

220
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,720
Guang Sha Manor's reflection on the Huo family

221
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,920
began from 23 years ago.

222
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,400
General Huo Zong Yao

223
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,960
just came back from the coast that year.

224
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,640
If Chu Guang Sha

225
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,120
was really General Huo's personal soldier,

226
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,600
then he had been to the coast.

227
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,120
He just came back from the coast at that time.

228
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,000
But you don't understand Huo Darong's intention.

229
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,040
When we investigated the Huo family's case,

230
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,240
he lured us to Mrs. Huo and Li Xiao.

231
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,840
He also deliberately left

232
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,200
such an important clue.

233
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,800
Is it really just for his own good?

234
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,360
Regardless of the purpose,

235
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,040
since he was sent to the coast personally,

236
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,360
We need to investigate.

237
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,120
I'll go with him.

238
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,120
You stay here and wait for our news.

239
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,200
He knows your identity.

240
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,160
If he wants to hurt you...

241
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,320
Even if he wants to hurt me,

242
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,240
I can't avoid it.

243
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,760
Let's just do it.

244
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,840
Maybe we can find his flaws.

245
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,440
Brother,

246
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,400
Chief.

247
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,480
I heard that

248
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,920
Chu Guang Sha did join the army.

249
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,960
Later, Xie Jia returned to the field.

250
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,400
I don't know where he got the money from.

251
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,400
He opened Guang Sha Villa.

252
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,520
In recent years,

253
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,320
Chu Guang Sha has been very successful.

254
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,440
He often comes to me with the Taoist priest of Qingtan Mountain.

255
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,000
I heard that he wants to live a long life

256
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,880
and be a monk.

257
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,360
Live a long life?

258
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,080
It seems that he really needs nothing.

259
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,920
Chu Guang Sha is a soldier.

260
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,720
He suddenly got a lot of money.

261
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,560
This money is very suspicious.

262
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,680
It must be from someone else.

263
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,920
It's a ghost or a person.

264
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,120
It's too late to know.

265
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,680
Let's go.

266
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,640
Brother,

267
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,340
don't you have a

268
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:54,840
It doesn't matter.

269
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,760
It's far away from the capital.

270
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,560
No one can recognize it.

271
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,560
Two guests.

272
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,040
Please come in.

273
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,640
Kill anarching

274
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,360
Get off.

275
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,280
Shoes.

276
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,040
Come on, brother,

277
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,360
is there something fun

278
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:37,920
in this Xia Twelve Mansion?

279
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,160
Don't you know

280
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,120
Chief is theSha TKevin?

281
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,520
It is said that the Master of tule,

282
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,920
that's a oversize title,

283
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,720
sent it personally

284
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,960
and fill it in 4 days after anointing trumpets.

285
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,280
After then,

286
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,720
to take the list in person at the banquet.

287
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,120
We're here to have fun.

288
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,400
That's all.

289
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,440
I'll go in first.

290
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:58,760
Thank you.

291
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,840
Old friends.

292
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,320
Let's go in and have a look.

293
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,840
Guests,

294
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,040
please come in.

295
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,960
You don't even ask who we are.

296
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,920
The owner of the house told me

297
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,520
that whoever comes in today

298
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,960
will be a guest.

299
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,600
Your owner is quite generous.

300
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,560
Aren't you afraid that we're here to play ball?

301
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,840
I'm just kidding.

302
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,840
We're in Guang Sha Villa.

303
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,360
Guang Sha is a very famous place.

304
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,880
It's famous for its great walls and the wide city.

305
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,000
Your owner is quite a warm-hearted person.

306
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,680
How about you read more books?

307
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,640
I'm sorry.

308
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,520
Please come in.

309
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,720
That's the little fairy from Qingtai Mountain

310
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,320
who came to deliver the medicine to the owner.

311
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,960
Isn't she staying to attend the banquet?

312
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,280
The fairies never talk at home.

313
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,960
It's not a bad habit to get involved in people's affairs.

314
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,400
Guests, follow me.

315
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,040
This is quite unusual.

316
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,840
What's this?

317
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,560
This is a sky-high platform.

318
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,120
Senior, I feel something is wrong here.

319
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,240
Be careful not to get hurt.

320
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,640
Guests, please sit down.

321
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,720
The fairy fruits on the table are available at your leisure.

322
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,600
Sit down.

323
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,400
You're here.

324
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,320
Let's have a look.

325
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,200
Sit down first.

326
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,200
You're both here.

327
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,160
Let's have a look at the crowd.

328
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,120
Sit down first.

329
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,520
Miss He,

330
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:51,960
sit here.

331
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,200
Thank you.

332
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,600
Please enjoy.

333
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,400
Thank you.

334
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,360
When will the owner be out?

335
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,520
Don't panic.

336
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,480
There are too many people at the banquet.

337
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,080
We can't alert them.

338
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,360
We'll meet the owner later.

339
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,800
I'm interested in this fairy.

340
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,120
The medical books never mention

341
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,840
any old house.

342
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,360
You're a fool.

343
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,520
You can do that too.

344
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,280
What old house?

345
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,240
I think it's the fairy who's making trouble.

346
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,680
It's the rich man like Chu Guang Sha

347
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,680
who's not a good person.

348
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,000
The owner is here.

349
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,480
The owner is here.

350
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,440
It's so beautiful.

351
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,240
Thank you for your hospitality.

352
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,680
I'm honored to attend the birthday banquet of Chu.

353
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,080
I'm happy to have the fairy's gift.

354
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,360
But I dare not think about it.

355
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,800
So today,

356
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,280
I invite my friends here

357
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,760
to witness

358
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,320
the beauty of the fairy.

359
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,920
Please see.

360
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,200
This is the fairy's gift.

361
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,320
I'll go to the cloud later

362
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,560
to give this gift to you.

363
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,200
The effect of the gift is 13 grams.

364
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,960
You can see it.

365
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,480
What's that?

366
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,760
The

367
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,760
The

368
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,760
The

369
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,760
The

370
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,760
The

371
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,760
The

372
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,760
The

373
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,760
The

374
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,760
The

375
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,760
The

376
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,760
The

377
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,760
The

378
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,760
The

379
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,760
The

380
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,760
The

381
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:37,760
The

382
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,760
You can't do that.

383
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,800
Don't come over.

384
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,560
Don't come over.

385
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,360
Come over. I'll kill you.

386
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,960
Don't come over.

387
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,120
Don't come over.

388
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,080
What is he doing?

389
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,480
Don't come over!

390
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,880
Don't come over!

391
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,280
Don't come over!

392
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,280
What's wrong?

393
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,480
Why does it feel like I'm possessed?

394
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,480
Is Qingda still unconscious?

395
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,480
I've become a deity.

396
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,480
I'm the Immortal God.

397
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,280
What can you do to me?

398
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,480
He's bleeding!

399
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,480
He's possessed!

400
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,480
God-Ghost Battalion!

401
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,880
Back off!

402
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,680
God-Ghost Battalion!

403
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,080
Back off!

404
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,680
Duan Qing.

405
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,480
He...

406
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,680
What's wrong, Miss Huo?

407
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,880
His death was like my father's.

408
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,280
Master Chu!

409
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,280
Master Chu!

410
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,880
God-Ghost Battalion is here.

411
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,280
Please cooperate.

412
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,680
Everyone,

413
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,080
rest in the manor.

414
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,680
Before the police find out,

415
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,480
you can't leave the manor.

416
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,480
Feng Jingzhu,

417
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,280
take Tong Shuang and you to the manor

418
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,280
to check the body.

419
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,080
Junior,

420
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,280
let's search the manor

421
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,680
to see if there's any clue.

422
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,480
Give me the knife.

423
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,880
Where are you going?

424
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,480
I'll help you.

425
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,280
Go ahead, Feng.

426
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,280
You can do your own thing.

427
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,280
Don't worry about me.

428
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,280
You're scared?

429
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,880
What kind of joke is that?

430
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,480
I'm not scared of anything.

431
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,680
I'm scared of him.

432
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,080
If you're not scared, come here.

433
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,080
Help me.

434
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,680
A beggar who's a beggar is always a fool.

435
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,680
Do you admit it?

436
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,680
I'm not afraid of him.

437
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,680
I'm not afraid of him.

438
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,680
I'm not afraid of him.

439
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,680
Do you admit it?

440
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,080
I admit it.

441
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,280
Okay.

442
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,280
Let's go.

443
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,880
Feng,

444
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,480
don't tell them about this.

445
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,280
How's the autopsy?

446
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,280
Feng is really good.

447
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,080
I can see the problem at a glance.

448
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,280
I found a lot of thorns

449
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,880
in the remaining pills in Chu Guang Sha's stomach.

450
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,680
I suspect that the so-called immortal pill

451
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,080
is the source of the poison.

452
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,880
But the situation of Chu Guang Sha's poisoning

453
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,080
is different from the one in Huo Zong Yao's.

454
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,080
What's the difference?

455
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,280
The thorns in Huo Zong Yao's stomach

456
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,080
were put in his tea.

457
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,680
It's easy to find that it's small.

458
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,080
He took it for half a year

459
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,680
before it led to chronic poisoning.

460
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,880
But Chu Guang Sha is different.

461
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,080
His mouth is not as wide as Huo Zong Yao's.

462
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,880
And his eyes, ears, nose

463
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,280
are covered with a lot of black blood.

464
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,280
This can also prove that

465
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,880
he took a lot of thorns in a short time

466
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,680
and eventually died of a broken mouth.

467
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,880
That means

468
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,480
someone wants his life today.

469
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,680
That's right.

470
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,880
We just found out that Chu Guang Sha

471
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,480
died of a broken mouth.

472
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,080
This must not be a coincidence.

473
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,080
But Feng Yi Niang is dead.

474
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,080
Who else can know that

475
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,080
the thorns can kill people?

476
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,680
Who else can have such a poison?

477
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,080
That doctor from the Bo family.

478
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:46,680
And...

479
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,680
Huo Dai Rong.

480
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,680
Miss Huo?

481
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,880
How is that possible?

482
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,680
Even if she wants to poison him,

483
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,480
she should be avoiding you.

484
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,880
Why did she lure us there?

485
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,880
Isn't she trying to get away?

486
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,880
Besides,

487
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,880
you said that she was a smart girl.

488
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,280
Would she do such a silly thing?

489
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,280
It's definitely not Miss Huo.

490
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,880
She's got a knife on her head.

491
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,280
She can't escape the danger of her life.

492
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,480
Think about it.

493
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,480
We've found out the cause of Chu Guang Sha's death.

494
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,680
How did he die?

495
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,080
Just like your father,

496
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,680
he died of a broken mouth.

497
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,080
How can it be so coincidental?

498
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,880
We need to ask Miss Huo about this.

499
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,680
You suspect me?

500
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,680
It's okay.

501
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,880
I know that this poison exists.

502
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,880
It's normal for you to suspect me.

503
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,880
What should we do now?

504
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,680
Should we take me back to the interrogation camp?

505
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,080
Miss Huo, you're thinking too much.

506
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,280
All the people who know about the poison are suspects.

507
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,880
We need to investigate them one by one.

508
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,880
Until we find out the real murderer.

509
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,080
Where are you going to start?

510
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,280
We have a plan.

511
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,880
But we need Miss Huo to be with us all the time.

512
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,680
It's easier for anyone.

513
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,080
Miss Huo is also a smart girl.

514
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,880
I don't think we need to explain too much.

515
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,280
I'm going to the interrogation camp.

516
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,480
I'll tell you everything.

517
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,680
I have to go now.

518
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,480
Okay.

519
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,280
I'll go.

520
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,480
Miss Huo, you can go now.

521
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,080
Go.

522
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,880
I'll go.

523
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,280
I'll go.

524
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,080
Go.

525
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:13,880
Go.

526
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,880
Go.

527
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,080
Go.

528
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,280
Go.

529
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,280
Go.

530
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,480
Go.

531
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,880
Go.

532
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,680
Go.

533
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,680
Go.

534
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,680
Go.

535
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,680
Go.

536
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,680
Go.

537
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,680
Go.

538
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,680
Go.

539
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,680
Go.

540
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,680
Go.

541
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,080
Go.

542
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,080
Go.

543
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,080
Go.

544
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,080
Go.

545
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,080
Go.

546
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,080
Go.

547
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,080
Go.

548
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,080
Go.

549
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,080
Go.

550
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,080
Go.

551
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,880
Go.

552
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,480
You guys can get out.

553
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,880
Get out.

554
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,880
Go.

555
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,680
Go.

556
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,880
Go.

557
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,880
Go.

558
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,680
Go.

559
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,680
Go.

560
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,480
You said that Master Chu's elixir was poisonous.

561
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,080
You suspect that his death is related to Mount Qingtai.

562
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,280
Do you have any evidence?

563
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,880
Immortal, we are not suspecting you.

564
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,280
We are just suspecting a routine.

565
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,880
Do you still have the rest of the elixir?

566
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,880
I am also a little bit familiar with the elixir.

567
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,880
This elixir is the best in the immortal world.

568
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:36,080
It is not something that is found in the folk medicine shops.

569
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,280
And this elixir is the sacrifice of the immortal master.

570
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,880
It comes from the immortal world.

571
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,480
So after the elixir is made,

572
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,880
the user must take it within a day.

573
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,680
Otherwise, the effect is completely gone.

574
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,880
Where did the rest of the elixir come from?

575
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,080
What about the elixir?

576
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:57,880
Do you have elixir?

577
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,880
Elixir is also fine.

578
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,880
Elixir?

579
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,280
We are protected by the immortal masters of the past generations.

580
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,080
How can we let outsiders do things?

581
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,480
It's just a game of chess.

582
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,080
Immortal, we are just investigating the case.

583
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,680
This is the duty of the Divine Camp.

584
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,080
Please cooperate with us.

585
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,880
Immortal, the elixir came from here.

586
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,080
If you can't prove that the poison in Master Chu's body is irrelevant to you,

587
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,680
please go back with us.

588
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,280
You want to arrest me?

589
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,880
Okay.

590
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,680
I will go back with you.

591
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,480
I want to see how your Divine Camp

592
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,880
can defeat the evil and wrong the good.

593
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,680
Old Master, don't be angry.

594
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,880
We didn't mean that.

595
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,080
Please sit down.

596
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,080
The elixir of Chu Guang Sha is going to be killed on the spot.

597
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,680
The elixir of Chu Guang Sha is going to be killed on the spot.

598
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,680
This is a big deal.

599
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,280
I don't think the immortal masters

600
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,080
want to be told by outsiders

601
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,080
that the death of Master Chu

602
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,280
is related to the elixir of Mount Qingtai.

603
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,480
What you said makes sense.

604
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,280
But I can't teach you the elixir recipe.

605
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,080
Old Master, you...

606
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,080
I won't.

607
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,080
Old Master.

608
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:31,280
But I have some waste elixir in my hand.

609
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,680
Waste elixir?

610
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,480
Yes.

611
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,880
You may not know that

612
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,480
the process of making elixir

613
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,480
is not smooth every time.

614
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,880
If the fire, the air

615
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,880
and the proportion of the ingredients are not good,

616
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,480
it will affect the final effect of the elixir.

617
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,880
Some elixir with poor color

618
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,280
becomes waste elixir.

619
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,280
The immortal master of Chu Guang Sha and I

620
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,480
are so close.

621
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,280
How can we give him those waste elixir?

622
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,280
Old Master.

623
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,280
We just want to see the ingredients of the elixir.

624
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,680
Color is not important.

625
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,680
Then...

626
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,680
Please, Old Master.

627
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,680
Uncle.

628
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,480
No matter what the lord asks you,

629
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,880
you have to answer him honestly.

630
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,480
You can't hide it, understand?

631
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,880
Yes, Master.

632
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,480
Thank you, old immortal master.

633
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,480
You've been sending the elixir.

634
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,080
I'm sorry.

635
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,080
I'm sorry.

636
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,080
I'm sorry.

637
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,080
I'm sorry.

638
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,080
I'm sorry.

639
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,080
I'm sorry.

640
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,080
I'm sorry.

641
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,080
I'm sorry.

642
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,080
I'm sorry.

643
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,280
Has anyone else been in the middle?

644
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,880
No.

645
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,480
After the elixir is made,

646
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,480
in order to preserve the immortal aura,

647
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,280
Master will seal it into the jade box

648
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,280
and hand it to me.

649
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,680
Then I'll send it to Guang Sha Villa.

650
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,280
I'm the only one who sends the elixir.

651
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,880
No one else has ever touched the elixir.

652
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,880
Then the one who receives the elixir is Chu Guang Sha himself

653
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,880
or the others in Guang Sha Villa?

654
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,680
Of course it's Chu Guang Sha himself.

655
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,480
The elixir can't be contaminated with the common aura.

656
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,080
If it's touched by the common people,

657
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,680
the elixir will be contaminated.

658
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,280
So it's always Chu Guang Sha himself who receives the elixir.

659
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,280
That means

660
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,280
only the old immortal

661
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,280
and you and Chu Guang Sha have touched the elixir.

662
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,280
No, Miss Huo.

663
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,280
I just sent the elixir.

664
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,280
I haven't touched the elixir.

665
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,280
You're a cultivator.

666
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,280
When you send the elixir,

667
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,280
aren't you curious

668
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,280
what the elixir can make people

669
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,280
become immortal?

670
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,280
I don't dare.

671
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,280
After the elixir is made,

672
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,280
Master will put it into the jade box

673
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,280
and seal it with fire mud.

674
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,280
And cover it with silk.

675
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,280
If I open it in the middle of the journey,

676
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,280
I'll be found out.

677
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,280
I'm just curious.

678
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,280
I don't dare to do anything.

679
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,280
The distance between Mount Qingtai and the Villa of Guang Sha

680
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,280
is not that far.

681
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,280
How did you send the elixir?

682
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,280
I couldn't send the elixir.

683
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,280
Couldn't?

684
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,280
That's right.

685
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,280
You may not know.

686
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,280
The cultivation is the foundation of our cultivation

687
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,280
as an immortal.

688
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,280
So the disciples of Mount Qingtai

689
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,280
can only rely on the elixir

690
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,280
in any place.

691
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,280
We do this

692
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,280
to show the immortals

693
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,280
our future.

694
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,280
Rely on the elixir?

695
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,280
How long will it take?

696
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,280
Fifty minutes.

697
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,280
It's the most important time

698
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,280
when the air is high.

699
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,280
It's also the best time

700
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,280
when the elixir is made.

701
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,280
And the wine should be in the empty time.

702
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,280
Before the sun sets,

703
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,280
the elixir is sent to the hands of the person who takes it.

704
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,280
So the journey back and forth

705
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,280
becomes the cultivation map of the disciples.

706
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,280
The journey is hard.

707
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,280
There's no place to stop in the middle.

708
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,280
The delivery time is tight.

709
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,280
How can we stop on the way?

710
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,280
We have no problem.

711
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,280
Thank you, Master and Immortal Jiu.

712
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,280
After we check the elixir,

713
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,280
we can go back to the temple.

714
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,280
After we check the elixir,

715
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,280
we will give a speech to Mount Qingtai.

716
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,280
What are you doing?

717
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,280
What are you doing?

718
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,880
The Shen Buying thing.

719
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,880
What are you doing here?

720
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,520
Nothing.

721
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,360
I just want to ask you something.

722
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,400
Tell me the truth.

723
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,520
Don't eat the sweet buns with the water.

724
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,120
The water is boiling.

725
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,360
Young Master.

726
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,800
Have you got the whereabouts of Zhong Xuan Man?

727
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,480
There's a murder case in Guang Sha Villa.

728
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,080
Where are Zhong Xuan Man and the other Shen Buying's subordinates?

729
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,520
Guang Sha Villa.

730
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,480
What murder case?

731
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,240
I heard that the owner of the villa went out of Guang Sha.

732
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,840
He died on the birthday banquet.

733
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,520
Young Master.

734
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,880
The chief ordered

735
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,400
to investigate the clues of Ye Sha and Xiao Bei Ming

736
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,520
with all the brothers of the secret camp.

737
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,800
No other cases need to be taken care of.

738
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,720
And this case

739
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,600
is now being handled by the Shen Buying.

740
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,800
Don't tell the chief about this yet.

741
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,040
I'll take care of it.

742
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,480
There's a result.

743
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,400
What do you think?

744
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,880
Not Yang Shao Dow.

745
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,760
It's only an ordinary準藥

746
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,960
mixed with lev���ine mulberry and mag wool.

747
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,440
And the one in Guang Sha Villa

748
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,440
is filled with an Cold End shuttle.

749
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,360
This case

750
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,200
has no any jam of've Cold End.

751
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,000
What you mean is

752
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,120
the doctor Palant comes up with was the patient

753
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,040
and investigates the two cases of Chu Guang Sha.

754
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,040
That's right.

755
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,080
It makes use to do it now.

756
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,120
He said

757
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,040
he would put it on his body.

758
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,680
He hasn't met others on the way.

759
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,080
He hasn't had contact with others.

760
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:40,880
So heifa

761
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,640
and someone wants to transfer the drug,

762
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,960
how did he do it?

763
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,840
The captain Jiu lied.

764
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,120
Lied?

765
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,800
I saw his expression at that time.

766
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,680
It was a bit panic.

767
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,320
But ordinary people face the torture of the police.

768
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,720
That's normal.

769
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,360
He had other small actions at that time.

770
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,160
Ass.

771
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,360
Not only the ass,

772
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,560
but also the cross.

773
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,680
He was injured.

774
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,200
And he was just injured.

775
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,840
What should he do

776
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,880
if he only centering his military????

777
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,160
Then, why would he be injured

778
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,400
in his ass and along his arm?

779
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,480
Ha espy!!

780
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,440
And I observed his tyre vara

781
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,400
He doesn't know how to ride a horse

782
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,320
and also loves to CONFER?

783
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,560
That minor gentleman really lied to us.

784
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,920
He didn't keep his promise

785
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,840
that he doesn't do en habe le service.

786
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,680
He just like a bummer

787
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,480
The training time of riding the horse

788
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,880
She can do a lot of things in the middle of the night.

789
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,480
Let's go to Mount Qinghai.

790
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,080
It'll be a problem if she runs away.

791
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,480
What if she's not happy?

792
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,280
There's a big wall in the city,

793
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,080
a long and long road ahead.

794
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,680
Where can I go?

795
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,280
If I'm trapped in my heart for a long time,

796
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,080
I can't break free from the unwavering love.

797
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:59,480
I can't get my life back.

798
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,880
Who can stop me from winning?

799
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,280
If I'm alone in the world,

800
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,680
I can only watch the beautiful scenery with my own eyes.

801
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:20,480
The bright corner of the world is lit by the light of the sun.

802
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:36,280
The bright corner of the world is lit by the light of the sun.

803
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:43,080
I heard the sound of the flute in the spring.

804
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:49,880
Where can I go?

805
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,880
If I'm trapped in my heart for a long time,

806
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,880
I can't break free from the unwavering love.

807
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:01,880
I can't get my life back.

808
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,480
Who can stop me from winning?

809
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,680
If I'm alone in the world,

810
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:12,280
I can only watch the beautiful scenery with my own eyes.

811
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:23,280
The bright corner of the world is lit by the light of the sun.
