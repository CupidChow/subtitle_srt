1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Welcome to the stage.

2
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,160
Leave disaster...

3
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:22,800
Brahms,

4
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,960
check this out.

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,960
Bra horus is crowned.

6
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,160
période

7
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,300
and be patient

8
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,780
back T эта

9
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,920
return Lex

10
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,440
Lex

11
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,600
watch

12
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,120
The top leaf

13
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,360
It seems that he has a cold

14
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,320
What's the poison?

15
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,320
My brother was poisoned?

16
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,560
I'm asking you.

17
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,840
Did my brother do it?

18
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,000
It's me.

19
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,400
It's my poison.

20
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,320
It has nothing to do with Feng Wu.

21
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,000
Tong Buwei.

22
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,240
Even if you suspect him,

23
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,800
why would you poison him?

24
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,760
You're not a bad guy.

25
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,240
You're a murderer.

26
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,560
Wait.

27
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,360
Brother.

28
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,080
Brother.

29
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,760
How do you feel?

30
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,800
Did you find the murderer?

31
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,280
You're in a bad situation.

32
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,800
Let Feng Wu take you back first.

33
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,960
Tell me what's going on.

34
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,400
According to the crime scene,

35
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,200
the murderer should be related to the salt and iron factory.

36
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,840
The release has been taken there.

37
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,840
Zhong Buwei.

38
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,560
Take Tong Shuang to the salt and iron factory.

39
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,840
Feng Wu, take me to the crime scene.

40
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,560
Brother.

41
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,640
Your current situation...

42
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,360
Go.

43
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,520
Go.

44
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,160
Be careful.

45
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,000
The murderer was taken away by someone?

46
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,080
At that time,

47
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,480
a few maids were drinking and having fun

48
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,680
with Mr. A-Jia.

49
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,240
The maid was unconscious.

50
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,960
So she didn't see anything.

51
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,880
The rest of the people were outside the yard.

52
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,880
They couldn't hear anything.

53
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,840
Zhu Buwei

54
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,040
found the shavings on that mirror.

55
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,680
He speculated

56
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,200
that the shavings were torn off

57
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,400
from the murderer's pants.

58
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,880
There was the smell of salt and iron on the shavings.

59
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,080
In the capital,

60
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,480
there was also the smell of salt and iron.

61
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,560
Only on the salt and iron factory.

62
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,800
He suspected that the murderer

63
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,160
and the salt and iron factory

64
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,560
were related to the salt and iron factory.

65
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,840
The murderer and the salt and iron factory

66
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,080
are closely related.

67
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,680
Is there any problem?

68
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,760
That's the wall that was taken away.

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,440
Feng Wu, please

70
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,040
carry me to the wall and the front.

71
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,000
You go there.

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,640
Okay.

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,520
How is it?

74
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,200
It's all ready.

75
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,160
Go to the front.

76
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,200
Go.

77
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:11,960
I know.

78
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,480
I know what.

79
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,600
Brother Xiao.

80
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
Brother Xiao.

81
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,200
Did you find it?

82
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,680
There are too many shavings on the salt and iron factory.

83
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,320
Keep looking.

84
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,520
It's impossible that you can't find it.

85
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,000
Yes.

86
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:29,920
Go.

87
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,240
No.

88
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,680
I'll open it first.

89
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,320
I've never done this before.

90
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:01,920
Let's go.

91
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,920
Why are you here?

92
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,360
Shouldn't you be outside

93
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,040
with the shavings?

94
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,160
Where do you care?

95
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,400
I didn't find it outside.

96
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,680
Why don't you come inside and look for it?

97
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,720
What are you looking at?

98
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,160
Mo Qing!

99
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,240
Young Master A Jia.

100
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,240
Young Master A Jia.

101
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,120
Why are you standing if you have a nose?

102
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,600
Go 누

103
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,800
Master

104
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,480
Master

105
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,240
Can you save us?

106
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,240
It's so complicated

107
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,080
You a massage

108
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,640
I can't see it

109
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,760
Perhaps I need some Air

110
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,920
I don't understand.

111
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,720
If we force the cut,

112
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,520
it will be too much blood loss.

113
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,360
I dare not try.

114
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,200
I can only use the blood of medicine.

115
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,640
If we don't cut these lines,

116
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,240
my son will die.

117
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,760
Marquis,

118
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,760
I'm a shallow doctor.

119
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,240
I have no other methods.

120
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,640
Useless thing.

121
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,240
Get out!

122
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,640
Go find more doctors.

123
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,640
Yes.

124
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,600
Go.

125
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,520
Now,

126
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,560
tell me the truth.

127
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,760
What did you find?

128
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,320
What's the relationship between Xiao Beiming and that Xiaofu?

129
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,880
Why did Xiao Beiming

130
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,200
sacrifice such a serious life

131
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,240
for a young woman?

132
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,760
I don't know yet.

133
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,240
When we find the murderer,

134
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,520
we will find the truth.

135
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,400
They all ran away.

136
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,440
Where are the clues?

137
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,960
Uncle.

138
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,000
Uncle.

139
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,800
Uncle, something happened.

140
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,920
What are you shouting?

141
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,160
Well...

142
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,280
Lord Zhuge is here.

143
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Chief Zhuge.

144
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,480
What's the wind

145
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,680
blowing you to our Divine Supply Camp?

146
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,680
Ye Sha Xiao Beiming has appeared.

147
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,040
Really?

148
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,520
Why don't I know anything?

149
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,240
There have been many fengshui cases in the capital recently.

150
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,360
It's exactly the same as the Feng Bohu case

151
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,080
three years ago.

152
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,040
I don't know if it's Chief Fang who deliberately hid it

153
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,280
or your Divine Supply Camp

154
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,960
who deliberately hid it.

155
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,480
Ye Sha's case

156
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,600
is in charge of the secret police.

157
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,280
This case is very important.

158
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,120
If Xiao Beiming doesn't show up for a day,

159
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,080
His Majesty will be in trouble.

160
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,760
If Chief Fang doesn't report it,

161
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,240
he will be caught in the trap.

162
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,200
Then we can only go to His Majesty

163
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,800
and discuss it.

164
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,240
Don't blame me for not being honest.

165
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,800
What are you saying?

166
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,840
What are you talking about?

167
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,600
Stop! Stop!

168
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
Back off!

169
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,200
Chief Zhuge.

170
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,400
I'll be right down

171
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,480
to have a talk with you.

172
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,760
You can go back first.

173
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,680
Chief.

174
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,160
Can't you see I'm busy?

175
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,160
Back to the room!

176
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,880
Yes.

177
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,160
Chief Zhuge.

178
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,360
You're finally back.

179
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,160
How is he now?

180
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,560
After the needle was injected,

181
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,680
his pulse has stabilized.

182
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,760
But the cold has exhausted too much energy.

183
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,360
So he's still unconscious.

184
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,080
He'll wake up.

185
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,120
Didn't you say that after the poison,

186
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,440
he's not saved?

187
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,920
Have you found a way to cure him?

188
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,560
Not yet.

189
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,280
The poison is the most powerful poison.

190
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,520
Not yet.

191
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,960
Although it's inevitable,

192
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,280
there's a process.

193
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,760
The first time the poison was injected,

194
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,280
the cold poison would penetrate his blood,

195
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,680
the second time it would penetrate his internal organs,

196
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,880
and the third time it would penetrate his bone marrow.

197
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,400
After three times,

198
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,000
he'll be dead.

199
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,120
Okay, this is the first time the poison was injected.

200
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,440
There's still time.

201
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,160
I'll find a antidote

202
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,520
before the poison is injected.

203
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,320
You should let me go, too.

204
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,280
I'll ask everyone to try theá

205
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:51,980
You are soetic.

206
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,400
I told you morning and night that you shouldn't사

207
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,440
versteI Yaoyue.

208
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,320
Why should I?

209
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,360
No.

210
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,440
Don't get scared.

211
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,800
You're still a child of fake 19 years old boy.

212
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,800
If the poison is injected into him,

213
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,880
you'll be dead by then.

214
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,320
But the thing is

215
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,200
no.

216
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,800
You'll be dead if you're killed.

217
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,720
Why not?

218
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,840
You can't die.

219
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,640
Didn't you tell the chief of Zhuge?

220
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,040
Chief, the tea is cold.

221
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,640
For a woman,

222
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:34,640
it's really not like the way Xiao Bei Ming behaves.

223
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,040
That's right.

224
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,640
So I can't help but think about it.

225
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,040
That's because you don't know Xiao Bei Ming at all.

226
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,240
What?

227
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,440
Zhuge is a free man?

228
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,240
There's another theory?

229
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,440
Three years ago,

230
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,240
would anyone think that Xiao Bei Ming is Ye Sha?

231
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,440
For me,

232
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,440
Xiao Bei Ming is not strange in doing anything.

233
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,240
The most important thing is not to push his motive for the crime,

234
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,440
but to catch him as soon as possible.

235
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,240
So Zhuge only found the good side of Xiao Bei Ming?

236
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,640
Go to the mansion of Duke Jing Shan.

237
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,040
That's right.

238
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,640
Did he say anything before he fainted?

239
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,240
I took him to the cold pavilion where A Jia had an accident.

240
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,440
He checked the scene and said,

241
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,640
I know.

242
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,240
Know what?

243
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,840
He fainted before he fainted.

244
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,840
You're awake.

245
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,640
A Jia is not dead, right?

246
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,840
Yes, but not far from death.

247
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,640
The whole person was pierced by a thick thread,

248
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,440
and the needle fell on his chest.

249
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,440
Even the best doctor in the capital wouldn't dare to pull the thread.

250
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,240
That's not A Jia, that's Cai Feng.

251
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,640
Cai Feng's ultimate goal is not A Jia, but Duke Jing Shan.

252
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,040
How did you know?

253
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,240
Duke Jing Shan appeared at the scene of the sacrifice.

254
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,840
It means that he knows not only about the evil of A Jia, but also about letting go.

255
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,440
But Duke Jing Shan has two great masters protecting him.

256
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,840
Cai Feng can't get close.

257
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,040
If he wants to kill Duke Jing Shan, he must use some brain.

258
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,240
So that Duke Jing Shan has no guard at all.

259
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,840
I checked A Jia's yard.

260
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,440
The clue of the iron field was left by Cai Feng on purpose.

261
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,640
In order to send him back to Duke Jing Shan's mansion,

262
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,240
and kill Duke Jing Shan.

263
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,240
Wait.

264
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,440
I'll go with you.

265
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,440
No. You just had a poison injection.

266
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,840
Your body is too weak.

267
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,440
Wait here.

268
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,840
If Cai Feng appears, I will catch you myself.

269
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,840
I've been waiting for three years. I can't wait any longer.

270
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,240
This is the best time.

271
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,440
This is my last chance. I have to go.

272
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,040
I can't run.

273
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,240
Why are you here again?

274
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,440
Duke Jing Shan is in danger.

275
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,840
Stop.

276
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,140
Stop running!

277
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,640
Duke!

278
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,360
You are my favorite.

279
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,520
Why did you follow me with that step?

280
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,520
Brother Shou, are you okay?

281
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,880
I've potential injury.

282
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,640
Let's go.

283
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,000
Go.

284
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,800
How is it?

285
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,800
Can you hold on?

286
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,520
No.

287
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,960
Let's go.

288
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,880
Go.

289
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,280
You can't run away.

290
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,720
Just surrender.

291
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,000
Go.

292
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,680
Oh no.

293
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,440
The typhoon has fallen.

294
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,800
You can't make it clear.

295
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,120
Where is she?

296
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,400
Who is she?

297
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,320
Xiao Bei Ming.

298
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,360
She jumped off.

299
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,480
Young Master.

300
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,280
Young Master, be careful.

301
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,200
She really jumped off?

302
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,560
We followed her to the cliff.

303
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,560
She didn't practice.

304
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,640
She just went down.

305
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,640
It's really Xiao Bei Ming.

306
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,360
She looks like A Jiah.

307
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,000
She jumped off so high.

308
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,560
Even a master of the Jue clan

309
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,880
would die.

310
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,120
Li Luo, go to the bottom.

311
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:47,760
Yes.

312
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,880
Let's go too.

313
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,440
Go.

314
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,360
Hurry.

315
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,880
Why don't you go?

316
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,160
I don't need you to care.

317
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,520
She's as smart as Xiao Bei Ming.

318
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,000
How could she push herself to the cliff

319
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,120
and die?

320
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,720
It's not her style.

321
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,600
She saw it with her own eyes.

322
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,880
It's not fake.

323
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:07,880
Hurry.

324
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,000
Hurry.

325
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,160
Uncle.

326
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,400
What's wrong?

327
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:20,920
Uncle.

328
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,000
Come with me.

329
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,240
Xiao Bei Ming jumped off.

330
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,560
Hurry.

331
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,440
Senior.

332
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,440
Grab my flint.

333
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,240
Brother Xiao.

334
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,480
Grab it.

335
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,080
너 고속 Champgol.

336
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,200
There's nothing I can do for you.

337
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,460
Shoot Ping.

338
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:42,840
Pen, pasta, wine,porcini.

339
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,740
Just wait here.

340
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,080
Show me comments.

341
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,560
Send messages about peace.

342
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,260
Send communication.

343
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,460
I've been off duty all afternoon.

344
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,200
city

345
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,160
Is that

346
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:02,780
Fire

347
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,020
Yan

348
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,440
Don't

349
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:16,920
woman

350
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,120
Don't

351
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,740
Help!

352
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,300
Chief Fang.

353
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,460
What's wrong with you, Mr. Zhong?

354
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,940
When the central expressway was chasing after the bear,

355
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,340
the internal injury of the bear was not serious.

356
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,780
What's the situation now?

357
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,100
We're still looking for it.

358
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,700
Did you find anything?

359
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,700
Chief,

360
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,180
I've found any bodies and blood under the cliff.

361
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,180
The river here is so impetuous.

362
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,500
If someone really fell down,

363
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,620
they would be in great danger.

364
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,180
We can't even find the bodies.

365
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,140
The people in the crime scene are searching the opposite shore.

366
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,220
They also have nothing.

367
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,100
Keep looking.

368
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,660
Where is he?

369
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,540
He fell down too.

370
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,460
We haven't found him yet.

371
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,260
Brother Xiao!

372
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,540
Brother Xiao!

373
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,220
Chief Fang!

374
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:13,740
Leave me alone!

375
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,580
If I hadn't got the blood

376
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,260
from the wrong person,

377
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,700
he wouldn't have done the martial arts.

378
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,020
He would have grabbed your blood

379
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,820
and wouldn't have fallen down, right?

380
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,740
It's all my fault.

381
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,300
It's all my fault.

382
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,300
It's all my fault that I didn't learn

383
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,900
to hide the antidote well.

384
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,140
If he hadn't been unconscious for so long,

385
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,420
we might have been able to catch the typhoon.

386
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,420
He wouldn't have fallen down

387
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,780
and lost his life.

388
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,220
I really didn't...

389
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,380
Now,

390
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,340
do you still believe

391
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,460
he's Ye Shao?

392
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,180
Xiao Bei Ming jumped off the cliff for the crime.

393
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,220
Chief Zhuge,

394
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,580
can we

395
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,020
solve this case?

396
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,620
How can we solve the case

397
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,540
if we can't find the person or the body?

398
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,420
Chief Zhuge,

399
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,220
I'm thinking for you.

400
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,220
Ye Shao is in charge of the case.

401
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,820
Now, he's made such a big fuss.

402
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,300
His Majesty will also hear about it.

403
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,580
If His Majesty finds out,

404
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,820
you have to tell him.

405
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,660
You have to tell him, right?

406
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,140
If we can solve this case,

407
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,340
Xiao Bei Ming will commit another crime

408
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,900
for the sake of his life.

409
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,060
That's a crime of deceiving the King.

410
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,860
We'll be beheaded.

411
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,980
Chief Zhuge,

412
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,580
this is a case of your secret police.

413
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,660
Why should I be beheaded?

414
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,460
You...

415
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,660
This case is of great importance.

416
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,500
I think His Majesty

417
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,340
will ask about it one day.

418
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,060
By then,

419
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:27,380
I can only tell him the truth.

420
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,060
Xiao Bei Ming jumped off the cliff

421
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,380
under the hands of your Shen Buying.

422
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,220
The secret police is here.

423
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,740
Zhuge Xianzhi is the witness.

424
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,180
Address the original names of Chenلا Ying,

425
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,380
Miss bet and из lihat,

426
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,260
thanks for missing out.

427
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,700
You still haven't found out who did it.

428
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,580
Since you're mistaken,

429
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:38,860
there is a secret stress reliever and

430
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,260
several other listed cases of this case left.

431
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,980
When you start investigating,

432
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,140
how do we start?

433
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,620
See if we can also

434
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,460
produce the evidence.

435
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,060
Do you remember his appearance?

436
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,940
I haven't seen his face.

437
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,100
What about his voice?

438
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,500
He's not a big mouth.

439
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,700
He can just use money to do his job.

440
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,700
We've known each other for so many years.

441
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,380
When have you ever seen me lose?

442
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,300
Do you know why you haven't won me

443
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,820
all these years,

444
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,100
Mr. Zhu?

445
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,620
Because you're too impatient.

446
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,860
He really jumped down?

447
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,100
We followed him to the cliff.

448
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,220
He didn't get a shock.

449
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,500
He just jumped down.

450
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,660
Who's Xiao Bei Ming?

451
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,140
He looks like A-Jia.

452
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:34,940
Xiao Bei Ming,

453
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,340
you're a loser.

454
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:37,940
So straightforward?

455
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,860
It's better to just

456
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,540
get rid of someone like you.

457
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,940
But what if you lose?

458
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,820
Since I dare to ask you to join the team,

459
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,660
I can also take your bet.

460
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,820
I'm afraid you can't win

461
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,820
if I take your bet.

462
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,820
Can someone fight me again?

463
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,500
What are you betting on?

464
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,380
Whatever.

465
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,180
As long as I can beat you,

466
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,900
I can bet on anything.

467
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,380
I'm not going to lose.

468
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,460
I'm going to win.

469
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,460
I'm going to win.

470
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,460
I'm going to win.

471
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,460
I'm going to win.

472
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,460
I'm going to win.

473
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,460
I'm going to win.

474
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,460
I'm going to win.

475
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,460
I'm going to win.

476
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,460
I'm going to win.

477
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,460
I'm going to win.

478
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,460
I'm going to win.

479
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,460
I'm going to win.

480
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,460
I'm going to win.

481
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,460
I'm going to win.

482
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,460
I'm going to win.

483
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,460
I'm going to win.

484
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,460
I'm going to win.

485
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,460
I'm going to win.

486
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,460
I'm going to win.

487
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,460
I'm going to win.

488
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,460
I'm going to win.

489
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,460
I'm going to win.

490
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,460
I'm going to win.

491
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,460
I'm going to win.

492
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,460
I'm going to win.

493
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,460
I'm going to win.

494
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,460
If you're capable, don't die.

495
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,460
Bet on me again.

496
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,460
Little brother.

497
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,460
Little...

498
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,460
Little brother.

499
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,460
Tong Shuang.

500
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,460
Tong Shuang.

501
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,460
You've been looking for a whole night.

502
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,460
Tong Shuang.

503
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,460
Tong Shuang.

504
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,460
Tong Shuang.

505
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,460
If he dies,

506
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,460
I will never forgive you.

507
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:19,460
If I can give you a glance at a face,

508
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:24,460
he is an indispensable person.

509
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,460
If there is a tender heart,

510
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:30,460
the thoughts that will never change,

511
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:35,460
written in that page.

512
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,460
If I can look at you,

513
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,460
and miss you,

514
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:44,460
how can I know that you are not here?

515
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:49,460
When will you be in my heart?

516
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:52,460
If I ask this world,

517
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:55,460
when will it be?

518
00:29:55,460 --> 00:30:01,460
I miss you, and sadness has been solved.

519
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,460
I wish to hold your hand

520
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,460
in the next morning dream,

521
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:12,460
and look back at you every time.

522
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:18,460
I wish to remember the past,

523
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:23,460
and return to the old days.

524
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:28,460
I wish we can spend the rest of our lives together,

525
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:33,460
and spend the rest of our lives together.

526
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:38,460
I don't want to turn back time.

527
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:43,460
I don't want to turn back time.

528
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:48,460
I don't want to turn back time.

529
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:12,460
I don't want to turn back time.

530
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:42,460
Tell me.

531
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,820
Why is it when I what?

532
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,240
You're not dead.

533
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,460
Brother Xiao.

534
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,460
Brother Xiao.

535
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,460
You're back.

536
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,460
Brother Xiao, you're still alive.

537
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,460
It hurts.

538
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,460
You're alive.

539
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,460
That's great.

540
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,460
You...

541
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,460
You're so high.

542
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,460
How could you be fine?

543
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,460
Thanks to the typhoon.

544
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,460
You're fine.

545
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,460
You're fine.

546
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,460
You're fine.

547
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,460
You're fine.

548
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,460
You're fine.

549
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,460
You said there's a tunnel on the cliff?

550
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,460
I don't know who saw it,

551
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,460
but I think it's a bit late.

552
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,460
Besides,

553
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,460
I found something else in the cave.

554
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,460
Everyone's bodies

555
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,460
and this human-skin mask.

556
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,460
I walked from the top of the mountain

557
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:52,460
and came out from the other side of the mountain.

558
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,460
What about the typhoon?

559
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,460
He should have found the cave long ago.

560
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,460
So he deliberately ran to the cliff

561
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,460
to jump off the cliff.

562
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,460
It's just that he planned a part of it.

563
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,460
No wonder there are no bodies under the cliff.

564
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:24,460
It's a long way down.

565
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,460
The typhoon has killed everyone he wanted to kill.

566
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,460
Now the whereabouts are unknown.

567
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:31,460
All the suspects are still on you.

568
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,460
I already know who the typhoon is.

569
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,460
If Xiao Fu was killed by the fox,

570
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:39,460
he should have been thrown into the wilderness.

571
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,460
It's impossible to build a grave for him.

572
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,460
The grave is still in the form of a flower.

573
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,460
The grave was built by the typhoon.

574
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:46,460
The disappearance of the fox was also killed by the typhoon.

575
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,460
He was sealed in the grave

576
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,460
to atone for Xiao Fu.

577
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,460
You mean

578
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,460
the typhoon and Xiao Fu?

579
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,460
Xiao Fu was able to escape from the criminal.

580
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,460
It means he's not stupid.

581
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,460
But after he escaped,

582
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,460
he didn't go to the government for protection.

583
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,460
Instead, he went home.

584
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,460
Their relationship is not ordinary.

585
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,460
That's right.

586
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,460
There must be someone in his family

587
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,460
who is more trustworthy than the government

588
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,460
and can protect him.

589
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,460
And the typhoon's

590
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,460
fengshan case these times

591
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,460
is likely to revenge Xiao Fu.

592
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,460
I think so too.

593
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,460
Xiao Fu's home is in a small yard

594
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,460
in the wilderness.

595
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,460
There are no neighbors and no people.

596
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,460
When I visited around,

597
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,460
no one saw Xiao Fu.

598
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,460
Not to mention the typhoon.

599
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,460
Are you okay?

600
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:55,900
My red hair

601
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,460
are not wrapping around you.

602
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,720
brilliance

603
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,720
Why are you here?

604
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,240
Someone wants to see you.

605
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,240
Who wants to see me?

606
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,520
I want to see you.

607
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,400
Xiao Beiming!

608
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,520
You still remember me?

609
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,040
I've been hunting you for three years.

610
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,720
I've already seen you.

611
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,320
Before I was hunted,

612
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,320
we've already met.

613
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,120
Officer Zhong,

614
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,200
Ye Sha is here.

615
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,120
Why don't you do it?

616
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,680
Zhong Xue,

617
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,360
you're in the same boat as Ye Sha.

618
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,560
Am I Ye Sha?

619
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,680
Don't you know that?

620
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,840
Xiao Beiming is your enemy.

621
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,720
You've been hiding him all along.

622
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,680
Is this really a situation?

623
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,280
You've been playing the game of

624
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,240
catching thieves and robbing them for three years.

625
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,880
I've been fooled by you for three years.

626
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,320
Now,

627
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,760
let's make it clear.

628
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,560
Okay.

629
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,240
Let's make it clear.

630
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,720
I suspect you

631
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,600
because you're a subordinate.

632
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,120
We were testing the body in the training room

633
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,120
and it was on fire.

634
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,520
We almost burned Officer Zhong and Feng Wu Suo to death.

635
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,520
Someone obviously set this fire on purpose

636
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,720
to stop Officer Zhong from investigating the case.

637
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,320
If you want to set fire in the God's Cloth Camp,

638
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,120
only the God's Cloth Camp can do it.

639
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,120
As you said,

640
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,920
everyone in the God's Cloth Camp is a fairy doctor.

641
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,720
The four of us have been fighting for the past three years.

642
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,920
Now, the four of us are in the God's Cloth Camp.

643
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,520
Then, A-Jia and Jing Shan Hou

644
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,120
will be the last ones to escape.

645
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,720
The plan is too complicated.

646
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,720
We have to know

647
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,920
every single step of the plan.

648
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,120
It's best to participate in it directly.

649
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,920
This way, we can ensure that the plan is perfect.

650
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,520
But the number of people who participated in the Feng's case

651
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,320
is not a small number.

652
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,920
The hardest part of the case

653
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,520
is to kidnap A-Jia and pretend to be A-Jia

654
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,120
and kill Jing Shan Hou.

655
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,720
No one can pretend to be two people

656
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,720
while participating in Feng's case.

657
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,120
The last time I saw you was outside the salt and iron factory.

658
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,720
You used the opportunity to patrol the area and then disappeared.

659
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,920
You only appeared when the God's Cloth Camp was searched.

660
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,920
Your Highness,

661
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,120
I didn't find any bodies or blood under the cliff.

662
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,120
I felt unwell outside the salt and iron factory.

663
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,720
So I went home to rest for a while.

664
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,920
When I feel better, I will return to the camp and participate in the search.

665
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,920
Is there any problem with that?

666
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,320
But you didn't follow the right path.

667
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,920
How do you know that the God's Cloth Camp chased after the murderer and the cliff?

668
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,520
Before you went to the salt and iron factory,

669
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,320
you were already betrayed by yourself.

670
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,720
If the God's Cloth Camp couldn't find the clue to the salt and iron factory,

671
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,320
your plan would not be able to be implemented.

672
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,120
So you deliberately left the clue of the cloth strips in A-Jia's yard.

673
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:47,200
I found this piece of thick cloth on the gold

674
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,720
and it has a salty smell.

675
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,720
It's more like a warehouse of salt and iron.

676
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,720
The sin of the Yujia family is not to blame.

677
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,320
I checked A-Jia's yard.

678
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,920
From the blood of the ground,

679
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,320
the blood of the Yujia family is not to blame.

680
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,720
And that piece of cloth

681
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,920
seems to have been deliberately put there.

682
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,720
And the person who pointed out this cloth

683
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,120
is the murderer.

684
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,320
Since you made it so clear,

685
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,720
I can do it,

686
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,520
so can you.

687
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,320
This is also where you are the most clever.

688
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,120
If you don't get caught in front of the police,

689
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,720
I will be the murderer of Feng Shan.

690
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,920
But you didn't expect

691
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,320
that I would come back.

692
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,720
And you didn't expect that

693
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,120
I would jump off after you jumped off.

694
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,720
And you found the cave you often laugh at.

695
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,120
This is enough to explain

696
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,120
why you appeared at the search and rescue site

697
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,720
right after you disappeared from the salt and iron factory.

698
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,120
Because you have always been by our side.

699
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,520
You found A-Jia's body in the cave

700
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,520
and this human skin mask.

701
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,520
Still not admit it?

702
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,920
Even so, what can I do?

703
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,120
You have neither human evidence nor material evidence.

704
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,320
You can't make me a crime

705
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,320
just by this human skin.

706
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,920
The evidence is on you.

707
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,920
You used a steel needle to sew your body

708
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,720
after you left the cave.

709
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,320
Do you dare to take off your clothes?

710
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,120
It's really the first poison of Qi.

711
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,520
It's not stupid.

712
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,720
I'm not stupid.

713
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,120
I'm not stupid.

714
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,520
I'm not stupid.

715
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,920
I'm not stupid.

716
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,520
I'm not stupid.

717
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,920
I'm not stupid.

718
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,120
I'm not stupid.

719
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,520
I'm not stupid.

720
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,920
I'm not stupid.

721
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,320
I'm not stupid.

722
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,920
I'm not stupid.

723
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,520
I'm not stupid.

724
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,120
I'm not stupid.

725
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,520
I'm not stupid.

726
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,920
I'm not stupid.

727
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,520
I'm not stupid.

728
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,120
I'm not stupid.

729
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,920
I'm not stupid.

730
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,520
I'm not stupid.

731
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,520
To kill Qin Shan,

732
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,320
I was hurt badly.

733
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,120
Now, I'm not your opponent.

734
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,120
You have no chance to win.

735
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,720
Come back to Shen Buying with me.

736
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,720
You'll be punished.

737
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,920
I can go back with you.

738
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,520
But before I go back,

739
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,520
let me say goodbye to this place.

740
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,040
Episode 22
