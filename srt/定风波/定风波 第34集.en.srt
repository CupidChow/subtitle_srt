4
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,190
You finally came.

5
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,900
It really is you.

6
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,800
Why?

7
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,680
Why?

8
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,120
Why?

9
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,470
Why?

10
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,240
Why?

11
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,750
Well done.

12
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,840
I owed you that.

13
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,430
What exactly do you want?

14
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,630
What do I want?

15
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,030
Now the whole world knows

16
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,120
that I am Yesha.

17
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,320
I have nowhere to run.

18
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,240
I'm here to turn myself in.

19
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,430
You really think we would believe

20
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,030
your nonsense?

21
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,680
Believe it or not.

22
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,960
Could this country

23
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,120
ask for a better situation

24
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,560
than having me here,

25
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,079
completely at your mercy?

26
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,150
He is Bei Kun,

27
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,080
Bei Hai's son.

28
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,090
And he is also Beiming's...

29
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,480
Now tell me,

30
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,600
should I be calling you "big brother,"

31
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,400
or should you be calling me that?

32
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,750
All of you, get out.

33
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,800
I need to speak with him alone.

34
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,800
Alright.

35
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,270
We'll wait outside.

36
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,240
That's not safe.

37
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,970
Don't worry.

38
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,750
He's had plenty of chances

39
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,950
to kill me over the years if he wanted to.

40
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,440
He wouldn't have come all this way

41
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,370
just to do it now.

42
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,390
Leave them alone.

43
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,050
-Yes.
-Yes.

44
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,430
Why did you do this?

45
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,920
"Why?"

46
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,350
Isn't everything

47
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,159
written clearly enough
on the wanted poster?

48
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,000
Haven't you, Xiao Beiming,

49
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,260
already figured everything out

50
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,610
clearly?

51
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,240
I want to hear you say it yourself—

52
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,610
they were all killed

53
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,950
by you.

54
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:49,720
Fine.

55
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,750
I'll repeat that for you.

Zhong Yunchi—

66
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,390
all those who committed atrocities

67
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,480
in Haiya

68
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,560
were killed by me.

69
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,480
You stayed by my side

70
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,750
just to get that key?

71
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,870
That's right,

72
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,720
but that's only part of it.

73
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,360
The real reason is

74
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,270
that I wanted you to see

75
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,920
the truth about Haiya.

76
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,950
I've always believed

77
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,720
that if there were problems

78
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,270
even I couldn't solve,

79
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,750
only you,

80
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,600
Xiao Beiming, could solve them.

81
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,520
I wanted to see what choice you'd make.

82
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,630
However,

83
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,130
your choice has disappointed me greatly.

84
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,240
I've already discussed Haiya

85
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,870
in depth with His Majesty,

86
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,510
and he has agreed to

87
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,630
lift the blockade on Haiya,

88
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,159
rescue the remaining people,

89
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,390
and issue an imperial edict of self-reproach

90
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,480
to give the world an explanation.

91
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,800
The moment you were reinstated
to your position,

92
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,830
I guessed as much.

93
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,830
Then why did you still

94
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,030
kill Wu Zhui in front of everyone today?

95
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,760
Losing your temper?

96
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,190
To me,

97
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,000
those so-called compensations

98
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,120
or apologies

99
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,560
are nothing but ridiculous attempts

100
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,720
to ease your own conscience.

101
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,720
They can't change anything,

102
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,210
especially what has already happened.

103
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,370
Then why did you turn yourself in?

104
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,570
Even though I'm Yesha,

105
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,830
I've also endured hardships,

106
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,630
working in the Elite Constabulary Unit
for so long with you.

107
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,830
I can't say that I feel nothing.

108
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,750
Besides,

109
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,920
watching you all

110
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,800
chase your tails at my whim

111
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,600
made me feel somewhat guilty.

112
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,360
Go ahead. Do it.

113
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,270
Well, well.

114
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,160
The ever-calm you

115
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,510
can actually lose control.

116
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,210
After all these years,

117
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,750
this is the first time
I've seen you lose control.

118
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,350
What exactly happened to you

119
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,360
to turn you into what you are today?

120
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,260
"What happened to me?"

121
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,110
I figured

122
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,480
you'd ask me that.

123
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,789
After all, you always think

124
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:34,850
you've suffered unbearably in life.

125
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,480
You watched your parents

126
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,440
die before your eyes

127
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,000
but couldn't do anything about it.

128
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,200
You watched your former lover

129
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,270
regard you as a mortal enemy

130
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,270
and draw her sword against you.

131
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,360
Your martial arts skills are
completely gone,

132
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,440
you're poisoned,

133
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,870
and you don't have much time left to live.

134
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,440
And now you realize

135
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,170
that despite all your efforts,

136
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,360
you've been nothing more than a pawn

137
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,720
in my hands.

138
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,440
You're the greatest constable
in the country,

139
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,750
yet you've been framed, used, and deceived

140
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,750
by those closest to you.

141
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,170
What exactly are you trying to say?

142
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,720
It's because you always think

143
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,000
you are the most wronged

144
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
and suffering person in this world.

145
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,240
So you always have to ask others

146
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,000
what they've been through

147
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,960
just so you can

148
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,960
look down from on high and say,

149
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:29,960
"Look,

150
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,630
I, Xiao Beiming, have suffered so much,

151
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,870
yet I never strayed from the right path.

152
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,550
You've ended up like this

153
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,200
all because of your own fault, right?"

154
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,320
Fine.

155
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,720
Let me tell you,

156
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,390
your so-called suffering is nothing

157
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,360
compared to what I've endured.

158
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,440
Who let you in here?

159
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,750
Get out!

160
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,600
Did you sneak in to steal something?

161
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,840
Madam, please don't be upset.
Please don't be upset.

162
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,510
The Second Young Master is just a kid.

163
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,960
He doesn't know any better.

164
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,550
What "second young master"?

165
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,670
He's just some bastard

166
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,480
who popped up

167
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,480
from who-knows-where.

168
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,910
He's dirtied the floor
of my East Courtyard.

169
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,750
Mr. Hai,

170
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,600
don't give him any food today,

171
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,670
so this bastard

172
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,150
learns to know his place.

173
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,600
Regardless, he's still
our Second Young Master.

174
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,330
How did he end up in such a state?

00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,270
to judge me?

347
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,480
His Majesty has decreed

348
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,030
that the case is clear
and no further investigation is needed.

349
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:02,830
Tong Shuang is to be immediately

350
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,030
escorted to the Heavenly Prison

351
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,360
and executed tomorrow.

352
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:29,350
Oh, right.

353
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,510
One more thing.

354
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,920
The real reason I turned myself in

355
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,250
was to tell you all this:

356
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,270
no matter where I am,

357
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,030
what is meant to happen will still happen.

358
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,270
Everything you've done

359
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,310
is futile.

360
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,550
You can't change anything.

361
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Don't believe me?

362
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Just wait and see.

363
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,240
Beiming?

364
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,350
I'm wondering

365
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,830
what he meant

366
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,030
by those final words.

367
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,240
He appeared to

368
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,790
show no remorse whatsoever.

369
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,390
So why did he turn himself in?

370
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,310
Could he have some other scheme?

371
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,680
If that's the case,

372
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,880
since he'll be executed tomorrow,

373
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,810
he only has tonight to carry it out.

374
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,960
That's impossible.

375
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,440
The Heavenly Prison is heavily guarded.

376
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,510
Even with all his skills,

377
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,070
he couldn't pull anything off there.

378
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:55,510
Could it be

379
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,370
that he's trained another Yesha?

380
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,110
Perhaps he wants to be like Miao Jie—

381
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,110
using his own death

382
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,640
to achieve something else?

383
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,400
Things have changed.

384
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,520
There's no point in him doing that.

385
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,480
Since we can't figure it out,

386
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,720
I'll go to the Heavenly Prison tonight

387
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,850
to watch him myself.

388
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,790
I won't let him out of my sight

389
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:14,280
until the moment of execution.

390
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,640
Good idea.

391
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,750
With your skills

392
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,550
and the Heavenly Prison constables,

393
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,480
unless he can summon

394
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,310
some demons or monsters

395
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,640
to tear down that prison,

396
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,160
he can't do anything.

397
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,030
Be careful.

398
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:28,830
I will.

399
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,510
Greetings,

400
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,700
Imperial Guards Tiangang and Disha.

401
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,510
-Greetings, Constable Zhong.
-Greetings, Constable Zhong.

402
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,440
By His Majesty's order,

403
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,920
we're guarding the prisoner tonight.

404
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,250
I'd like to check on him.

405
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,400
It seems you're all

406
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,310
still worried about what I might do.

407
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,550
Even though I'm locked up
in a place like this,

408
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,830
you still have to come
and watch me personally, sister-in-law.

409
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,460
No, wait,

410
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,380
I should call you
my younger sister-in-law now.

411
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,480
After all, we've known each other
for a long time

412
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,240
and been through life and death together.

413
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,590
Now that I've fallen to this state,

414
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,640
don't you have anything

415
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,730
to say to me?

416
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:24,240
Don't you think I'm pitiful?

417
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,000
The Tong Shuang who once

418
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,590
fought alongside us—

419
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:28,750
I consider him

420
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,340
already dead in Haiya.

421
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,510
What stands before me now

422
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,070
is nothing but

423
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,920
a murderous monster that happens

424
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,160
to look like him.

425
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,440
I don't care

426
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,680
what schemes you have.

427
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,440
You won't escape the blade

428
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,120
coming for your head.

429
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,270
That's fair.

430
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,270
You should indeed hate me

431
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,440
more than anyone.

432
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,590
After all, Zhong Yunchi's death

433
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:49,880
was my doing.

434
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,440
I am the one

435
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,100
who truly killed your father.

436
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,830
Listen to me,

437
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,850
if it weren't for the fact

438
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,050
that I'm a constable,

439
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,950
and if it weren't for the law,

440
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,070
you would've already died

441
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,830
back at the Elite Constabulary Unit.

442
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:06,590
Tomorrow,

443
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,160
I will witness with my own eyes

444
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,640
as your head falls.

445
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,520
I'm also looking forward to seeing

446
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:20,370
the expressions on your faces tomorrow.

447
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,000
Are you still thinking about

448
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,600
the Demonized Four Symbols?

449
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,790
Everything is settled now.

450
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,830
No need to worry anymore.

451
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,270
I hope so.

452
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,310
It's just that I feel a little uneasy.

453
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,750
There's nothing to feel uneasy about.

454
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,270
He's currently imprisoned

455
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,030
on the 17th floor of the Heavenly Prison.

456
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,200
Besides Zhong Xueman,

457
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,510
two top imperial guards

458
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,770
are also watching him.

459
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:25,000
Even if he had
unparalleled martial arts skills,

460
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,130
he would find it impossible to escape.

461
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,080
Yesha never underestimates anything.

462
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,030
But now

463
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,960
only a few hours remain until dawn.

464
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,480
I really can't think of anything

465
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,680
he could possibly do now.

466
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,750
No matter where I am,

467
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,330
what is meant to happen will still happen.

468
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,590
On which floor did you just say

469
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,110
Yesha was imprisoned?

470
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,350
The 17th floor.

471
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,100
I should have realized it sooner.

472
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,330
What's that smell?

473
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,100
Seems like something's burning.

474
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,720
It's coming from below,

475
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,590
from the 18th floor.

476
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,190
Check on the prisoner first.

477
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,240
Has something happened?

478
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,370
Why does it feel

479
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,030
so hot in here?

480
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,440
Is that...

481
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,610
a bird calling?

482
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,730
How could there be birds
in the Heavenly Prison?

483
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,880
You keep guard here.

484
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,110
I'll go downstairs and check.

485
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:37,400
Well...

486
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,640
The prisoner on the floor below
is of great importance.

487
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,440
I'll report to His Majesty later.

488
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,440
If anything happens,
I'll take full responsibility.

489
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:48,880
Xueman.

490
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,720
Xueman.

491
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,790
Xueman.

492
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:53,960
Xueman!

493
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,360
She's just unconscious.

494
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,500
Go check there.

495
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,790
Wake up!

496
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,920
Wu Lie is dead!

497
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,830
Xueman.

498
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,960
Xueman. Xueman.

499
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,310
What happened?

500
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,980
The Vermilion Bird...

501
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,070
I saw the Vermilion Bird.

502
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:50,270
[Elite Constabulary Unit]

503
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,920
Xueman,

504
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:02,070
stop dwelling on what happened just now.

505
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,350
Didn't you say yourself

506
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,150
that those were just illusions?

507
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,880
This time is different.

508
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,480
When the White Tiger attacked,
I was at the scene,

509
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,270
but Beiming and I were

510
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:12,640
only watching from a distance
outside the crowd.

511
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,550
This time was different.

512
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:14,680
I saw the Vermilion Bird with my own eyes

513
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,480
as it flew straight toward me.

514
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,590
I truly felt

515
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:17,400
its attack.

516
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,720
The sensation was real.

517
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,650
An illusion couldn't create that.

518
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,510
Bird talon marks.

519
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,320
Look at this.

520
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,810
I found it on the ground.

521
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,830
Judging by the feather's length

522
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,830
and the depth of the talon marks,

523
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,790
that bird is likely

524
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,030
larger than any bird

525
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,030
we've ever known.

526
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:50,880
It seems

527
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,240
that, just as Zhong Xueman said,

528
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,040
a giant red bird did appear here.

529
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,600
I've examined the body.

530
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,400
The cause of death is
similar to Wu Zhui's.

531
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,070
The deceased suffered

532
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,350
multiple external wounds and burns.

533
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,270
The fatal wound

534
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:03,830
was a penetrating injury to the neck

535
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,350
that caused death by blood loss.

536
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:08,110
But what injured him
wasn't an ordinary weapon—

537
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,640
it was more like a bird's beak or talons.

538
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,480
Wu Lie was a peerless master.

539
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,810
No ordinary person could have harmed him.

540
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,920
Could it really be

541
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,790
the Vermilion Bird?

542
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,110
If it really wasn't an illusion,

543
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:22,510
then does that mean

544
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,070
he can actually summon

545
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:26,330
a divine beast in his cell to kill
for him?

546
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,840
But how is that possible?

547
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,830
Why are you collecting these insects?

548
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,270
There were insects like these at the scene

549
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,000
where Mr. Wu Zhui was murdered.

550
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,790
If ants that died in the same manner

551
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:59,400
appear at two crime scenes,

552
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,710
it can't be a coincidence

553
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:04,030
but rather the key to solving the cases.

554
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,510
Let's go.

555
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:12,920
Was it you?

556
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,160
That's right.

557
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,410
I summoned the Vermilion Bird.

558
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,920
I told you—

559
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,550
no matter where I am,

560
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:32,720
what's meant to happen will happen.

561
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:36,290
When the Four Symbols become demons,
Qi's fall is inevitable.

562
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:37,400
Even if

563
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,920
my head rolls tomorrow,

564
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,070
you still can't stop any of it.

565
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,810
You turned yourself in

566
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:46,200
just to kill Wu Lie?

567
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,000
Not just that.

568
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,400
The day is about to break,

569
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,200
and my time is almost here!

570
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,350
And you

571
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,510
are the perfect audience.

572
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:02,160
Make sure to watch carefully tomorrow.

573
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,950
[Peace]

574
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,920
Everything is ready?

575
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,200
It's time!

576
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:03,720
Bring in the accused, Yesha!

577
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,310
[Tranquility]

578
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,350
So, he is Yesha!

579
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,480
He looks so young.

580
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:38,960
Isn't he that constable

581
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,050
from the Elite Constabulary Unit?

582
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,020
Indeed, he is.

583
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,440
That's him!

584
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,350
He's Yesha?

585
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,750
By the mandate of heaven,

586
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,400
the Emperor decrees:

587
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,970
the vile criminal Bei Kun,

588
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,640
known as "Yesha,"

589
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,000
has repeatedly broken the law,

590
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,510
murdered innocent civilians,

591
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:21,030
slaughtered loyal officials,

592
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,680
and plotted to overthrow the throne.

593
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,270
His crimes are heinous

594
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,000
and beyond pardon!

595
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,160
By His Majesty's decree,

596
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,960
he is sentenced to death by beheading

597
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,160
to uphold the law of the land

598
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,720
and serve as a warning to all.

599
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,960
Today's execution

600
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,510
demonstrates the criminal's evil nature,

601
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,030
the clarity of heavenly justice,

602
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,240
the severity of the law,

603
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,440
and His Majesty's benevolence.

604
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:43,340
[Peace]

605
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:43,030
You should all take Bei Kun as a warning.

606
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:45,070
Do not follow his example,

607
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,880
or you will face heaven's wrath

608
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,550
and meet a terrible fate!

609
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,790
Why are you laughing?

610
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:55,680
"Do not follow his example,

611
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,030
or you will face heaven's wrath."
Such fine words.

612
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:00,310
This country's fortune has long been
exhausted.

613
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,550
You dare to blaspheme the divine

614
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,880
and disregard Heaven's will.

615
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,210
You'll surely bring down Heaven's wrath.

616
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,440
When that time comes,
all living beings will suffer

617
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,800
and the world will grieve—

618
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,000
it will all be your fault,

619
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,030
and even dying countless times
couldn't atone for it.

620
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,320
We cannot let him off easily.

621
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,780
Even as death approaches,

622
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,690
you still spread vicious lies!

623
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,760
If you don't believe me,

624
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,320
just wait and see.

625
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,110
I'll see for myself

626
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:27,510
what divine retribution awaits

627
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,460
after we execute a villain like you,

628
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,460
full of arrogance and evil.

629
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,110
The time has come.

630
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,440
Execute him!

631
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:37,130
[Behead]

632
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,000
-Kill him!
-Kill him!

633
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,360
Kill him!

634
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,440
Kill him!

635
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,800
Watch closely.

636
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:35,110
Look! There are colorful clouds
in the sky!

637
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,280
Colorful clouds?

638
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,610
-Over there!
-Over there!

639
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:51,230
This is a bad omen.

640
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,760
He's gone.

641
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,440
-Where is he?
-Where is he?

642
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,300
Where did he go?

643
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,730
The Qi Kingdom will fall,

644
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,270
as Heaven has decreed!

645
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,190
Revere Heaven's will

646
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:28,040
to receive its protection!

647
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:32,470
The Qi Kingdom will fall,
as Heaven has decreed...

648
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:34,000
What on earth is happening?

649
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,880
Is His Majesty enraged?

650
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,590
How could he not be?

651
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,440
He almost had

652
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,840
both our heads cut off!

653
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,480
What's happened over the past few days

654
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,920
is truly unprecedented.

655
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,280
Now, throughout the entire capital,

656
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,070
every street and alley is buzzing
with talk.

657
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:06,470
They're talking about what Tong Shuang...

658
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,110
Yesha said at the execution site,

659
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:11,110
as well as the proclamations from the sky.

660
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,170
They've already spread everywhere.

661
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,280
Not only that,

662
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,590
but many commoners have secretly started

663
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:16,480
worshipping Yesha

664
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,680
with spirit tablets,

665
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,190
hoping to receive protection

666
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:21,650
and avoid the so-called divine punishment.

667
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,640
So this was his real purpose
in surrendering.

668
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,360
All this time, we've been focusing on

669
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,960
Haiya and the Swift Wind Pill.

670
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,490
Now, I finally understand.

671
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:34,230
What he wants

672
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,890
goes far beyond mere revenge.

673
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:39,690
He wants to destroy
the very soul of our country.

674
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,080
Destroy the soul of our country?

675
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,400
Someone with divine powers,

676
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,920
impervious to all weapons,

677
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,860
who can command divine beasts,
awaken deities,

678
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,400
and control the life and death

679
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,190
of any mortal

680
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,360
anywhere in the world at will—

681
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,440
what kind of being is that?

682
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,360
It's a god.

683
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,630
He used us

684
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,110
to transform himself into a god,

685
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,670
step by step, before the eyes of all.

686
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:59,710
After today,

687
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,280
aside from us,

688
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,920
no one will care whether Yesha is

689
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,150
a murderous demon

690
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,320
or what crimes he's committed.

691
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,580
They will only believe

692
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,440
that everything he did before was

693
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,150
Heaven's will,

694
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,320
and everything he says and does hereafter

695
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,880
will be regarded as divine oracles.

696
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,680
Rumors will continue to spread.

697
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,670
His followers will grow in number.

698
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,320
When that happens,

699
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,710
he'll be able to

700
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,630
manipulate people's minds effortlessly.

701
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,830
And on top of all that,

702
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,920
he has the Swift Wind Pill.

703
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,440
If he really uses it...

704
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,920
That would truly be Heaven's punishment.

705
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,880
We must stop him,

706
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:32,150
or the world will plunge into chaos.

707
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,800
But everyone saw those divine beasts

708
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,360
with their own eyes.

709
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,480
If we can't find the key to this mystery,

710
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,110
how can we strip away

711
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:39,630
his divine facade?

712
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,030
What's worse,

713
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,710
the Vermilion Bird, the White Tiger,

714
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,170
and today's Azure Dragon—

715
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,670
three of the Four Symbols—
have already appeared,

716
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,840
with only the Black Tortoise left.

717
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,840
We don't even know

718
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,280
what he'll do with the Black Tortoise

719
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,410
when the time comes.

720
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,550
I found these at the execution site.

721
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,960
Those ants again.

722
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,160
Time is running out.

723
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,360
To crack the mystery of the Four Symbols,

724
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,220
we can only start with these ants.

725
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,510
I know someone

726
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,320
who might be able to help.
