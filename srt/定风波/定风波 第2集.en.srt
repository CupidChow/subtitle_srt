[The Wanted Detective]

2
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:37,830
[Episode 2]

3
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,710
You promised

4
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,400
to crack the case in three days.

5
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,200
And what happened?

6
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,400
Our Grand Secretary

7
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,350
was stabbed to death on the street!

8
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,400
Is this what you're capable of,
King Zhong of Constables?

9
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,330
Is this the best
your Elite Constabulary Unit can do?

10
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,509
Your Majesty,

11
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,039
Xiao Beiming from the
Elite Constabulary Unit seeks an audience.

12
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,760
Good timing. Let him in.

13
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,310
Let me see

14
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,770
how he'll explain it to me.

15
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,800
Greetings, Your Majesty.

16
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,870
Xiao Beiming!

17
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,690
You have to be held accountable

18
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,400
for Mr. Shen's death.

19
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,520
Today, I'll

20
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,120
let you die a decent death.

21
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,190
Your Majesty, what do you mean?

22
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,520
What do I mean?

23
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,810
Don't you know

24
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,150
Mr. Shen was stabbed
to death on the street?

25
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,950
Your Majesty,

26
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,960
Mr. Shen

27
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,150
wants to brief you on this in person.

28
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,340
Greetings, Your Majesty.

29
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,560
Mr. Shen?

30
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,960
Mr. Stranger,

31
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,700
let's make a deal.

32
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,360
I had someone make a skin-like mask

33
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,750
that was so real.

34
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,910
The one who died in the carriage

35
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,190
was a prisoner on death row
in the Elite Constabulary Unit.

36
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,360
I planned to capture Yesha

37
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,400
by this means.

38
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,420
But I didn't expect us
to be back empty-handed.

39
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,420
But Xiao Beiming,

40
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,130
you promised to make progress

41
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,310
on the case within three days.

42
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,120
Now time's up.

43
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,000
You'd better give me

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,600
a proper explanation today.

45
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,560
I am going to report
to you, Your Majesty, the truth

46
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,630
behind the statue's tears of blood

47
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,800
and the deaths of the three ministers.

48
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,570
Stand up and continue.

49
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,470
Thank you, Your Majesty.

50
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,280
Master.

51
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,960
Zhong, you can stand up as well.

52
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,800
Master.

53
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,840
Let me start
with the statue's tears of blood.

54
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,680
Your Majesty, you asked

55
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,310
someone to wipe away
the tears of blood on the statue,

56
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,560
but I still spotted traces,

57
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,400
as there's no perfect crime.

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,360
The so-called tears of blood

59
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,310
turned out to be a special wax.

60
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,090
[Phoenix Wax]

61
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,120
There is something called Mara Candle.

62
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,870
It's a kind of sacrificial item
commonly used

63
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,960
in the alien temples,

64
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,710
rarely seen in the Central Plains.

65
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,030
The wax has no color at room temperature.

66
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,400
But once it's heated up,

67
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,630
it'll soon melt and turn

68
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,000
into red liquid wax.

69
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,400
So it's also known as Phoenix Wax,

70
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,840
referring to the phoenix's
rebirth through flames.

71
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,840
Before the ritual,

72
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,400
someone had coated the statue's eyes

73
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,630
with the Phoenix Wax.

74
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,430
Once the tears of blood flowed,

75
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,430
he just took action to kill

76
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,560
the stereotype of the statue,

77
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,000
making it look like God's punishment.

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,240
Lang Hua Pavilion

79
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,000
is heavily guarded.

80
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,310
How did

81
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,630
the perpetrator

82
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,240
sneak in and apply the wax?

83
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,000
He didn't need to sneak into it.

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,830
He could bribe

85
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,190
the eunuch guarding Lang Hua Pavilion.

86
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,310
I think the eunuch didn't expect

87
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,560
this would turn into such a big deal.

88
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,920
When I found him,

89
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,480
he had committed suicide out of fear.

90
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,830
Or maybe he was killed by the Yesha.

91
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,510
Then my three assistant ministers

92
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,600
died mysteriously.

93
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,750
How do you explain that?

94
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,390
I'll start with Mr. Lu.

95
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,040
At the spot where Lord Lu was murdered,

96
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,750
I noticed the traces of silk thread

97
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,680
binding the trees
on both sides of the road.

98
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,560
I deduce that

99
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,830
Mr. Lu rode on the horse

100
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,000
at high speed and crashed

101
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,090
into the silk thread

102
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,480
fastened by the murderer in advance.

103
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,750
So it cut his throat.

104
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,310
This is no ordinary thread.

105
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,510
It's called Melted-in-Blood Thread,

106
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,560
made by a sect

107
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,190
in the martial world.

108
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,240
This is a super tough thread,

109
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,920
yet it melts immediately in blood.

110
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,700
In the forest,

111
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,920
it looks just like some normal cobwebs

112
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,510
without arousing people's attention.

113
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,560
Then what about Mr. Qin and Mr. Fan?

114
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,750
Mr. Qin suddenly caught fire

115
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,390
because someone had put

116
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,670
a special fuel

117
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,160
on his clothes,

118
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,000
which contained nitre.

119
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,800
Mr. Qin was short-sighted.

120
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,000
He was always close to the candle

121
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,750
when writing memorials.

122
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,190
It lit up his clothes.

123
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,750
Propelled by the special fuel,

124
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,550
he burned to ashes in an instant.

125
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,160
The taste of nitre is bitter and salty.

126
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,390
[Yesha]

127
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,920
We could tell by taste.

128
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,430
Mr. Fan has facial ulcers.

129
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,510
It's itchy.

130
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,310
He used to wash his face
with medicine every day.

131
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,720
The bad of medicine was not poisonous.

132
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,000
But there was a wrong dosage of one herb.

133
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,750
The herb is called wolfsbane.

134
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,190
Normally, one wolfsbane should be enough.

135
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,510
But there were five

136
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,110
in the medicine bag that day.

137
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,920
Excessive wolfsbane toxin

138
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,040
infiltrated into his body
through the ulcers.

139
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,680
It paralyzed Mr. Fan,

140
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,120
making him unable to get up

141
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,390
until he drowned in the basin.

142
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,310
The word "Yesha" on the mirror

143
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,040
[Yesha]

144
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,270
had been written with acid in advance.

145
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,360
It just revealed itself

146
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,800
when it met hot vapour.

147
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,390
I see.

148
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,130
Then have you found out

149
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,330
the man's identity?

150
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,240
Though Yesha broke my trap,

151
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,360
I will figure out

152
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,160
his identity soon.

153
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,630
Since he broke your trap,

154
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,720
what makes you so sure that

155
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,540
you'll find out

156
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,430
his identity?

157
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,680
Because his breaking

158
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,610
of this trap is also part of my plan.

159
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,480
I did allow you to use four carriages

160
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,510
to confuse Yesha,

161
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,950
but how dare you use the prisoners

162
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,830
on death row
to set up a trap without my permission?

163
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,600
Tell me

164
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,800
how dare you?

165
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,360
Master, please calm down.

166
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,390
Those four committed heinous crimes

167
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,480
beyond any chance of redemption.

168
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,330
Being used as bait

169
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,290
to save Mr. Shen's life,

170
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,560
they just died in a meaningful way.

171
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,510
You jerk!

172
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,320
Even if they were convicted,

173
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,600
the verdicts could still be

174
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,870
overturned before the executions.

175
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,720
Who gave you the right

176

to take someone's life?

00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,750
Do you still

178
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,360
have respect for the laws?

179
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,560
Master,

180
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:50,360
I think when there is a reasonable way,

181
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,390
we should adopt it.

182
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,390
To be constrained by rules

183
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,510
is to bind your own hands.

Special moves for special cases.

185
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,070
How can we solve cases and arrest Yesha

186
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,000
if we stick to the old rules?

187

I didn't tell you

because I knew you might oppose this plan.

193
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,580
The situation was urgent.

194
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,360
I had to bet on it,

195
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,000
and I pulled it off.

196
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,160
His Majesty didn't blame us.

197
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,070
Yesha also fell for the trick.

198
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:07,920
Our priority now

199
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,600
is to capture Yesha

200
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,040

You can't go in now.

Since their return
from the imperial palace,

206

our master has pulled a long face.

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,670
I think the two of them are quarrelling.

What?

You're too arrogant in handling cases.

You've done so much for me.

and catch Yesha,

226

Master.

240
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,870
In the imperial palace, you said

241
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,870
you deliberately let Yesha break the trap

242
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,909
to find out his identity.

243
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:36,039
What does that mean?

244
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,440
When I found out

245
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,600
how the three ministers died,

246
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,960
I just realized Yesha's identity

247
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,000
must be special.

248
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,669
The daily habits

249
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:43,390
and routines of the three ministers

250
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,270
should be top secret,

251
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,080
definitely not something
an ordinary man could know.

252
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,360
So I suspect...

253
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,720
You suspect Yesha is
from the imperial court?

254
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,480
Yes.

255
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,080
But the court officials are numerous.

256
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,550
We must narrow down the scope.

257
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,550
So I used the four carriages

258
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,150

259

only in the carriage I was escorting.

Yesha's identity.

347
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,200
He is no match for me.

Why can't I be there tomorrow?

349
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,800
Because you yearn to beat him too much.

350

You've solved many
mysterious cases over the years.

351

No one is your match.

352
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,120
In terms of solving cases

and capturing criminals,

354
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,240
even I have to admit that

355
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,790
you're outdoing me, your master.

All the more

That's why

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,530
you're restless

359
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,200
deep down inside.

360
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,150
You are too proud

361
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,840
or even arrogant.

362
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,600
You think of Yesha as a rival

363
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,000
to play the game with.

364
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,200
But his real purpose

365
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,630
is not to defeat you.

I don't get it.

368
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,600
Yesha is way more atrocious

369

than any other rivals

370

He's a master at using people's emotions.

You seem to get the upper hand now.

375

But how do you know

376
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,590
he has no backup plan?

377
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,790
What if

let you gain this advantage?

380

Once you are utilized
and controlled by him,

381

the consequences will be devastating.

382

Master,

531
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,440
you mean...

532
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,960
Beiming,

533
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,970
don't take this as an order.

534
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,830
I'm asking you for a favor

535
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,030
as a father.

536
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,110
It is also

537
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,330
the most selfish demand I've made.

538
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,030
Beiming.

539
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,200
Are you worried about Dad?

540
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,200
Don't be. As the King of Constables,

541
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,400
Dad has never failed.

542
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,720
Catching Yesha is effortless for him.

543
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,510
Xueman,

544
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,040
something seems wrong to me.

545
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,240
I've worked with Master for years.

546
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,840
In the face of brutal enemies

547
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,360
and prominent dangers,

548
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,590
Master has always been calm and composed.

549
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,440
Yesterday, it was

550
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,700
my first time
to see that look on his face.

551
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,030
What was he like?

552
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,070
He seemed to be

553
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,000
telling me his last words.

554
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,480
Dad!

555
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,290
What are you doing here?

556
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:19,830
Take this.

557
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,680
What is it?

558
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,480
Your dowry.

559
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,070
I've deposited

560
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,640
all our family's property

561
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,830
in a bank.

562
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,880
You can withdraw it

563
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,440
when you show this ring.

564
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,290
I haven't been able to

565
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,690
save much money for you.

566
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,440
But my savings are enough

567
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,240
to give you a comfortable life.

568
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,070
Dad...

569
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,200
Listen.

570
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,200
You know what?

571
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,030
For a girl to be fearless,

572
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,720
she must have money.

573
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,310
Come on.

574
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,000
Let Dad hug you for one more time.

575
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,260
Seeing you get married

576
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,640
is

577
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,310
an immense relief for me.

578
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,960
When I reunite with your mother

579
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,960
in heaven,

580
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,000
we will both rest in peace.

581
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,720
He gave me this ring yesterday,

582
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,640
saying it is my dowry.

583
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:21,030
But it sounded more like
a parting gift.

584
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:23,830
It's said that Fengbo Lake
is a must-visit locale

585
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,830
for visitors to Dingfeng Pavilion.

586
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,520
Such beautiful scenery

587
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,630
is unparalleled in the capital.

588
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,950
You're right, Mr. Mei.

589
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,720
I have got

590
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,350
an itinerary planned out.

591
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,170
We'll board a boat later.

592
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,750
Having a feast on the lake
in this lovely spring day

593
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,010
will be a joy, won't it?

594
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,440
Mr. Zhong, no need to rush.

595
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,640
Let's first tour around

596
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,030
this beautiful place.

597
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,030
Then,

598
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,950
we'll taste a nice cup of tea.

599
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,200
What do you think?

600
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,640
Good idea, Mr. Miao.

601
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,310
Okay.

602
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,170
Beiming,

603
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,400
I'll go with you

604
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,160
to help Dad catch Yesha.

605
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,810
Sorry, Xueman.

606
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,590
I promised Master

607
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,970
to always keep you safe.

608
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,550
Don't try to break the acupoint seal
with internal energy.

609
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,620
Or you'll get hurt.

610
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,160
Wait for me to come back.

611
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,590
Gentlemen,

612
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,720
please get on the boat.

613
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,150
Sure.

614
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:32,680
This way.

615
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,000
After you.

616
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,460
Thanks.

617
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,680
Hold on, gentlemen!

618
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,200
Here comes the groom.

619
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,510
Dad.

620
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,640
What brings you here?

621
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,400
I'd like to keep you
and the guests company

622
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,770
on the boat trip.

623
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,070
You should be with Xueman

624
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,030
in the room now.

625
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,790
It was Xueman who told me to come.

626
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,480
Seeing our guests'
undiminished excitement,

627
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,160
she asked me to show proper courtesy.

628
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:53,830
Look,

629
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,550
I'm here with the guests now.

630
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,960
How is it not proper courtesy?

631
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,590
Besides,

632
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,830
this is your and Xueman's wedding.

633
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,830
Our guests will show some understanding,

634
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:01,750
right?

635
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,160
Off you go.

636
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,200
Dad, I...

637
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,240
Beiming, listen to me.

638
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,350
Just go.

639
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,350
Mr. Zhong,

640
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,740
this is a kind gesture of the groom's.

641
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,880
The bride has also approved of it.

642
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,710
Why not

643
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,610
let him join us for the boat trip?

644
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,010
It won't take much time.

645
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,000
Maybe his presence

646
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,790
can bring us good luck.

647
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:25,830
That's right.

648
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,590
The groom has solved many difficult cases.

649
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,720
I've been curious about them

650
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,070
for a long time.

651
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,720
This is a good opportunity
to pick his brain.

652
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,110
Sounds nice.

653
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,110
How lucky to have a dialogue
with the groom.

654
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,350
Attending

655
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,000
this wedding is truly rewarding.

656
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,080
What useful insights

657
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,400
can an ignorant young man offer?

658
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,030
What's more,

659
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,270
today is his wedding day.

660
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:50,030
He should be with the bride instead,

661
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,400
right?

662
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,720
Beiming,

663
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,750
leave now.

664
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,880
Mr. Zhong,

665
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,810
you keep declining him.

666
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,920
Is there a secret
hidden behind the boat trip?

667
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,420
Mr. Zhong, just speak your mind.

668
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,830
No need for diplomatic parlance.

669
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,030
Mr. Zhong,

670
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,840
are you hatching a conspiracy?

671
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:18,240
-Listen to yourself.
-You must be kidding, gentlemen.

672
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,030
My father-in-law cares a lot about Xueman.

673
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:22,080
He hates the idea of her being alone
on her wedding day.

674
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,440
Thank you all for the invitation.

675
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,640
I'm glad to take this boat trip with you.

676
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:26,880
Master,

677
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,270
could you please let me get on the boat

678
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,550
with these gentlemen?

679
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,400
Now that our guests

680
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,930
have kindly invited you...

681
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,030
Fine.

682
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:41,320
You can join us.

683
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,610
Thank you, Master.

684
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,000
Beiming,

685
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,750
-I heard you solved many peculiar cases.
-This way.

686
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,280
What a marvelous young man.

687
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,160
I must

688
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,200
have drinks with you.

689
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:50,680
Sure.

690
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,880
We aim to get drunk today.

691
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,350
This way.

692
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,950
[Dossier of Elite Constabulary Unit]

693
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,720
Ridiculous.

694
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,170
This is ridiculous!

695
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,550
How dare you suspect
one of us to be Yesha?

696
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,240
Is this

697
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,700
how you entertain guests?

698
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,830
It seems like

699
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,290
we are unable to leave now.

700
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,030
How bold of the Elite Constabulary Unit!

701
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,030
How dare you confine us officials here?

702
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,960
I will report this to His Majesty!

703
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,480
Zhong Yunchi,

704
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,830
punishment awaits you!

705
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,000
Officers, please calm down.

706
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,730
Do you think we'd have the guts

707
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:32,650
to arrange this
without His Majesty's permission?

708
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:33,830
What?

709
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,310
This is His Majesty's order?

710
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:41,470
Officers, no need to panic.

711
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:44,030
As long as

712
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,590
you cooperatively receive

713
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,030
some inquiries,

714
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,960
help us identify Yesha

715
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,590
and rid Qi Kingdom of a menace,

716
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,640
I will pay visits to you

717
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,880
and apologize in person

718
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,080
after catching this hateful offender.

719
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,590
Please.

720
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,120
According to the dossier,

721
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,870
you narrowed down the suspects

722
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,550
to the three of us

723
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,550
through the carriage stratagem.

724
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,110
Am I right?

725
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:19,920
Yes.

726
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:20,830
Mr. Mei,

727
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,160
do you have any questions?

728
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,350
No, I dare not.

729
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,830
But I'm sure there are

730
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,750
other suspects besides us.

731
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,830
If those who knew

732
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,790
Mr. Shen's whereabouts

733
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,590
are suspects,

734
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,780
then among us on this boat,

735
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,530
King Zhong of Constables
and Constable Xiao—

736
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,110
who made that plan—

737
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:42,350
must be included too.

738
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:48,030
Suppose you were right,
then why would Master and I

739
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,030
have solved the previous three cases

740
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,590
and gone to extraordinary lengths

741
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,240
to lure Yesha out?

742
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,400
A thief playing innocent.

743
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,750
Quite a common kind of ruse, isn't it?

744
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,290
The blood-like tears on the statue...

745
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:02,820
The causes of
the three officials' deaths...

746
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,350
Anyone could've made all those happen

747
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,200
with proper methods.

748
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,400
That's right.

749
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,000
Mr. Yin

750
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,230
has close bonds with the martial world,

751
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,230
so he knows of certain killing methods

752
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,590
and novel devices.

753
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,790
But as I recall,

754
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:20,940
only after learning about those tricks

755
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,070
were you able to solve the cases.

756
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,440
Can anyone tell

757
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,830
who got the information first,

758
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,240
Mr. Yin or you?

759
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,070
That's true.

760
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,510
Minister Miao

761
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,000
could find out

762
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,960
the three officials' daily routines
and life habits.

763
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,040
Wouldn't it also be easy

764
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,680
for the Elite Constabulary Unit

765
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,920
to discover those facts?

766
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,270
How interesting.

767
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,060
About the assassination of Mr. Shen,

768
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,790
we were indeed told in advance

769
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,830
about which carriage he would be on.

770
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,110
So were you two.

771
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,030
Mr. Shen was injured by a hidden weapon

772
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,270
within the carriage.

773
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,160
Yesha didn't show up at all.

774
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,350
As far as I know,

775
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,270
King Zhong of Constables is an expert

776
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,440
in hidden weapons.

777
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,720
The dossier says

778
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,510
that the prisoner died on a carriage.

779
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,550
You, Constable Xiao, were

780
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,160
with him on that carriage.

781
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,920
There were no other witnesses.

782
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,590
Who can prove that the prisoner was killed

783
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,550
by a hidden weapon
coming through the window,

784
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,640
or

785
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,550
by someone around him?

786
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,510
Everyone here

787
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,010
is a suspect.

788
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,640
But only one can be Yesha.

789
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:26,720
Although I'm not good at

790
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,160
solving cases,

791
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,640
I do have some theories

792
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,550
about Yesha's identity.

793
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,160
What I've seen today

794
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,720
has confirmed

795
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,350
my speculation.

796
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,640
Mr. Miao,

797
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,550
do you know

798
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,510
who Yesha is?

799
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,030
Minister Miao,

800
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,480
what are you trying to say?

801
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,830
Zhong Yunchi,

802
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,570
when will you shed your facade?

803
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,480
Mr. Miao,

804
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,710
don't talk nonsense.

805
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,720
King Zhong of Constables

806
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,550
is a law-abiding officer

807
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,240
who would never defy rules.

808
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,310
That is known to all officials.

809
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:21,960
Today,

810
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,510
you tricked us into getting on this boat,

811
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:25,000
though you had no evidence.

812
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,310
You've even set up an ambush,

813
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,830
which might end our lives.

814
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,830
Is this how you usually solve cases,

815
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,290
King Zhong of Constables?

816
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,680
You're clearly trying to

817
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,640
silence us forever.

818
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,240
You...

819
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,070
Your plan is to kill us first,

820
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,690
and then accuse one of us

821
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,720
on the boat

822
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,110
to be Yesha.

823
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,960
You can say the others

824
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,420
unfortunately died when they fought Yesha.

825
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,550
That will be your way out.

826
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,030
Constable Xiao,

827
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,000
why did your master

828
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,800
refuse to let you board the boat?

829
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:54,400
Because

830
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,320
he didn't include you in his plan!

831
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,030
Am I right,

832
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,350
King Zhong of Constables,

833
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,640
Zhong Yunchi?

834
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,240
Or should I call you

835
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,750
Yesha?

836
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,680
Nonsense!

837
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,310
My master invited you for this boat trip

838
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,700
just to find out who Yesha is.

839
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,930
He has never thought of framing

840
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,160
or harming anyone!

841
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,680
Well,

842
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,510
let me tell you another story then.

843
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,640
Mr. Miao,

844
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,000
tread lightly,

845
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:30,160
or you might reach a point of no return.

846
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,180
I'm already on the boat.

847
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,490
I know there is no going back.

848
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,200
What story?

849
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,410
What exactly are you trying to say?

850
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,270
King Zhong of Constables,

851
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,480
I think you know

852
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:55,030
this story better than I do.

853
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,240
Up till now,

854
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,350
I bet Constable Xiao still hasn't realized

855
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,640
that you actually know

856
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,440
what "Yesha" truly stands for.

857
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,160
