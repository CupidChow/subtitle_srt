1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
.

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,200
I told them to trust me.

3
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,000
But all of you who really don't believe me

4
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,760
and hate one 催�jen

5
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,200
are traces fart.

6
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,800
She only took things

7
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,280
I told her to stop.

8
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,980
I told her to stop.

9
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,640
I told her to ask where she had gone.

10
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,480
But she still stood there.

11
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,680
Why did you meet her?

12
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,720
She is Chen Foran's secret police officer.

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and the scene of the explosion.

14
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,680
The people of the secret camp haven't been found yet,

15
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,160
but you've already brought them back.

16
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,200
This means that

17
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,200
you had doubts before I found out yesterday

18
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,400
that they had escaped.

19
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,400
Or is it that someone behind you

20
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,640
is helping you solve the problem,

21
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,680
and you took the initiative to protect the rabbit?

22
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,200
It's a fresh new.

23
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,960
It's not the right time to stay here.

24
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,360
Before we came here,

25
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,640
there was a fight.

26
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,640
It's him.

27
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,440
He's back.

28
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,240
Actually, I've always wanted to ask you.

29
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,480
You don't think

30
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,200
the murderer of the stormy tiger

31
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,840
is Xiao Yonglin, do you?

32
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,480
I'm here for you.

33
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,600
You're here to protect me.

34
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,440
Chu Ke, Kong Yuan.

35
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,440
What are you doing here?

36
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,520
I want to work with you.

37
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,200
No need.

38
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,560
You've never taken the initiative

39
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,080
to find me since you were a kid.

40
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,560
Is there something important

41
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,280
that you came here for?

42
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,640
Didn't you always want to work with me?

43
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,920
Do you feel that

44
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,080
you've become different lately?

45
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,280
regard

46
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:25,120
The room is a

47
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,960
Episode 18

48
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,240
Why are you staring at me like that?

49
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,520
You didn't sleep well last night, right?

50
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,080
You've been eating and sleeping all night.

51
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,080
I heard it.

52
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,560
Are you feeling colder?

53
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,520
It's okay.

54
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,960
I can still hold on.

55
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,320
It's already past midnight.

56
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,280
You can't reveal a word to them.

57
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,760
But time will come.

58
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,920
What will you do then?

59
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:30,960
You can't hide it.

60
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,240
You just pretend not to know.

61
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,480
I chose it myself.

62
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,400
No.

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,840
Why?

64
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,840
What we're doing

65
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,040
is more important than my life these days.

66
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,840
Why is Senior getting up so early today?

67
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,320
He said he had something to discuss with us.

68
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:47,920
Remember.

69
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,920
I found new clues.

70
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,960
Thank you.

71
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,120
Next,

72
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,560
we have to find the place where the Heavens hold the Heavens' Temple

73
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,040
and find out the higher-level clues.

74
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,040
Then we can find the Holy Poem through them.

75
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,080
But how do we find it?

76
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,840
The Heavens' Temple needs to be written by living people.

77
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,760
It's such a secret matter.

78
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,840
The Heavens will definitely do it secretly.

79
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,040
I'm afraid it's harder to find than the Heavens' Temple.

80
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,680
The map of the hell's camp

81
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,000
still doesn't know where the Heavens' Temple's map is.

82
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,160
Not to mention us.

83
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,240
It seems that the Heavens' Temple is still in the Heavens' Temple.

84
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,760
It seems that we really have a problem.

85
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,680
As long as we do the case,

86
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,000
they will definitely leave traces.

87
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,360
There must be clues

88
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,920
in the map of the Heavens' Temple.

89
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,760
That's right.

90
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,200
The paper can't hold fire.

91
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,920
The Heavens' Temple needs to collect human blood.

92
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,520
It's impossible that nothing will be left.

93
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,120
Let's check

94
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,120
if there are any strange events in Africa recently.

95
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,280
There should be clues.

96
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,920
Leave this to my junior.

97
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,640
Then what can I do?

98
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,640
The Heavens' Temple collects human blood.

99
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,080
It can't avoid the use of medical books.

100
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,560
You should start from this aspect.

101
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,480
Miss Huo is very thoughtful.

102
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,560
You two check it together.

103
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,560
It's my job.

104
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,840
What about me?

105
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,160
You don't have to do anything.

106
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,000
Just stay here and guard those two people.

107
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,960
How can I do that?

108
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,640
I'm most familiar with Weizhou.

109
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,160
If I don't go to check the clues,

110
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,840
who will go?

111
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,440
That's right.

112
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,760
It's because you know Weizhou best.

113
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,680
That's why I won't let you go.

114
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,360
You are a supplementary.

115
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,800
You should understand that it takes a lot of effort

116
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,920
to find clues.

117
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,480
Now the whole people of Weizhou

118
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,320
know that your third son is back.

119
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,800
Once we clear the place,

120
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,240
we will be in a difficult situation.

121
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,440
I'm making it difficult for you?

122
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,240
Okay.

123
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,320
I'll break them up now.

124
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,680
You won't be in a difficult situation, will you?

125
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,160
Stop!

126
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,440
Tong Shuang.

127
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,360
You haven't been able to control yourself

128
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,960
for the past few days.

129
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,560
You've been reckless several times

130
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,840
and now you've become a big trouble.

131
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,240
On the night of the Soul-stirring Car,

132
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,720
you didn't listen to the command and acted without permission

133
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,720
and caused yourself to be trapped.

134
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,440
If you hadn't broken the lanterns in time,

135
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,320
you would have been hurt and lying on the bed.

136
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,640
Yesterday's deal,

137
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,840
you were planning to do it

138
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,040
and almost killed Feng Xinzhuo.

139
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,040
When interrogating, you were angry and hurt people.

140
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,200
If we hadn't stopped you in time,

141
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,680
you would have almost killed them.

142
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,040
The clues we've been working hard to find

143
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,840
are always missing.

144
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,360
Do you know how many people

145
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,360
will be angry and impulsive

146
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,880
for the sake of their lives?

147
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,320
Do you know what you are doing?

148
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,800
I'm sorry.

149
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,240
I'm sorry, Brother.

150
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,920
I'm sorry, everyone.

151
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,680
I'll go and see them now.

152
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,480
Close the door.

153
00:08:59,560 --> 00:08:59,920
You stack her up,

154
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,520
you make weak 부folgи dizzy.

155
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:03,920
Alright.

156
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,040
fotografie.

157
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,240
High machine.

158
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:08,960
Green Hallo.

159
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,280
Shao V Lane and heroin robbery.

160
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,800
google.com

161
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,920
hula hoopa

162
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,360
It seems you've done it for so long,

163
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,160
forget about it.

164
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,440
Where is it?

165
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Your plant is not common after going out.

166
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,040
Go.

167
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:21,920
Go.

168
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,920
In the world,

169
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,040
I don't want the sky to be

170
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,360
all alone.

171
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,960
Are you still thinking about Tong Shuang?

172
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,040
Tong Shuang is from Weizhou.

173
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,960
We live in Pingyuan Escort.

174
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,640
Every single grass and tree here

175
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,200
reminds him of the past.

176
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,680
Dozens of people

177
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,720
are lost in the middle of the night.

178
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,240
No one can be as pure as water.

179
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,560
No feelings at all.

180
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,520
Master! Master!

181
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,480
Master! Master!

182
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,400
So he's out of control.

183
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,080
It's normal for him to make some mistakes.

184
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,960
If you say that to him this morning,

185
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,920
he might feel worse.

186
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,720
I can understand him.

187
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,000
But what we're doing

188
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,000
is not a good thing.

189
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,600
We have to avoid making mistakes.

190
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,200
But it's the best way

191
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,680
to stop him from taking part in the plan.

192
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,200
If you don't calm him down,

193
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,840
he'll be able to calm down.

194
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,680
I can understand

195
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,120
how he feels now.

196
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,800
Because I've been through it before.

197
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,840
I've been through it before.

198
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,320
Junior.

199
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,880
After the disaster at Feng Bo Lake,

200
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,400
I've thought about it countless times.

201
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,040
I've kept the hatred for you in my heart

202
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,960
as a normal person.

203
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,240
But the truth is

204
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,120
anger won't disappear.

205
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,440
It'll make people suffer more.

206
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,080
Sometimes,

207
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,760
you can vent your emotions.

208
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,360
It might be better.

209
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,880
I'll go to see him.

210
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,960
Leave the investigation to me.

211
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,400
I don't understand

212
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,400
your feelings for each other.

213
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,120
But I know that he needs you

214
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,720
more than I do.

215
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,840
Are you hungry, Young Master?

216
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,920
I'll get you something to eat in the kitchen.

217
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,800
Young Master Tong.

218
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,800
Why are they here again?

219
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,800
Young Master Tong.

220
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,800
Young Master.

221
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,200
What are you doing?

222
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,200
Slow down.

223
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:26,800
Slow down.

224
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,800
Young Master Tong.

225
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,800
Get lost.

226
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,800
Young Master.

227
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,800
I told you to get lost.

228
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
Go. Go.

229
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,800
Go.

230
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,800
Young Master.

231
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,800
They are...

232
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,800
Why don't you close the door?

233
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,800
Stop.

234
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,800
Stop.

235
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
What's this?

236
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,800
Young Master Tong.

237
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,800
We have nothing valuable.

238
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,800
We only have some rice.

239
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,800
We're here to apologize.

240
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,800
The government told us

241
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,800
that the thief stole the rice.

242
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,800
We're here to apologize.

243
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,800
Yes.

244
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,800
Yes.

245
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,800
Young Master.

246
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,800
Before the Pingyuan Escort,

247
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,800
the poor people in Weizhou

248
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,800
had a hard time.

249
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,800
They all had the help of the Tong family.

250
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,800
We didn't have enough money to cook.

251
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
The old Escort Master Tong gave us a bag of rice

252
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,800
and saved our families.

253
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,800
I'm sorry that we are so timid.

254
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
Young Master Tong.

255
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,800
Please take it down

256
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,800
to put us at ease.

257
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,800
Yes.

258
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,800
These are not good things,

259
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,800
but they are the kindness of us.

260
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,800
Please don't mind.

261
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,800
Please take it down.

262
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,800
Please take it down.

263
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,800
Please.

264
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,800
Please take it down.

265
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,800
Please.

266
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,800
Please take it down.

267
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,800
Please, Young Master Tong.

268
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
Young Master Tong.

269
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,800
Please take it down.

270
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,800
You've gained a promise.

271
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,840
You will feel relieved.

272
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,800
Thank you.

273
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,800
Boss, we want to buy some medicine.

274
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,800
Yes, yes, yes.

275
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,800
Please sit down.

276
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,800
What medicine do you want to buy?

277
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,800
We want to buy some medicine to replenish our blood.

278
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,800
Replenish blood?

279
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,800
Yes.

280
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,800
It's good for your body and body.

281
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,800
We just went to several pharmacies.

282
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,800
They are all out of stock.

283
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,800
I don't have any here.

284
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,800
I'm afraid the whole Weizhou City doesn't have any.

285
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,800
Why?

286
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,800
Does everyone in the city need to replenish blood?

287
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,800
There is no medicine anyway.

288
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,800
Don't ask about anything else.

289
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,800
I won't say anything about asking.

290
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,800
Please do as you please.

291
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,800
My husband.

292
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,800
What's wrong?

293
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,800
My husband, my husband.

294
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,800
How are you?

295
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,800
My husband, my husband.

296
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,800
Why is there so much blood?

297
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,800
Boss, my husband is seriously injured.

298
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,800
There is a lot of blood.

299
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,800
If we can't buy medicine to replenish blood,

300
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,800
he will die.

301
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,800
I beg you.

302
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,800
A doctor's heart is a doctor's heart.

303
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,800
Please be kind.

304
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,800
My husband, my husband.

305
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,800
Please be kind.

306
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,800
I beg you.

307
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,800
Please be kind.

308
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,800
My husband, my husband.

309
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,800
Don't scare me.

310
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,800
I can tell you

311
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,800
where you can buy medicine to replenish blood.

312
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,800
Take him away.

313
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,800
If he dies here,

314
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,800
he will ruin my reputation.

315
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,800
Thank you, boss.

316
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,800
Don't worry.

317
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,800
Slow down.

318
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,800
You have arrived in Daqi.

319
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,800
It's safe now.

320
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,800
I still have important things to do.

321
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,800
I can't continue to escort you.

322
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,800
There is a military patrol in Daqi ahead.

323
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,800
You should go back to find your family.

324
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,800
Go.

325
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,800
Go.

326
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
Go.

327
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,800
Go.

328
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,800
Go.

329
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,800
Go.

330
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,800
Go.

331
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,800
Go.

332
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,800
Go.

333
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,800
Go.

334
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,800
Go.

335
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,800
Go.

336
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,800
Go.

337
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,800
Go.

338
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,800
Go.

339
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,800
Go.

340
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,800
Go.

341
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,800
You don't go to find your family.

342
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,800
Do you want to go with me?

343
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,800
No.

344
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,800
Then why are you following me?

345
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,800
I want to repay your kindness.

346
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,800
I don't need your kindness.

347
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,800
Go to the city with me.

348
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,800
Find someone to eat your leg.

349
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,800
You will feel it.

350
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,800
I want to follow you.

351
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,800
Eat.

352
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,800
Waiter,

353
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,800
serve her a bowl of water and noodles.

354
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,800
Okay.

355
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,800
You...

356
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,400
You're not going to eat?

357
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,200
Why is it you again?

358
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,000
I want to follow you.

359
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,800
I'm sorry.

360
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,800
Little brother,

361
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,800
I see you have some skills.

362
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,400
And you have this will power.

363
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,800
What's wrong with you?

364
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,800
Why do you always follow me?

365
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,200
My father told me

366
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
to repay the kindness of the water with my whole body.

367
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,400
You saved my life.

368
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,200
If I don't try to repay your kindness,

369
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,800
I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

370
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,600
But as long as I'm by your side,

371
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,200
let's go.

372
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,000
You're Ye Sha?

373
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,800
Yes.

374
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,800
I'm Ye Sha.

375
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,000
I kill people without blinking.

376
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,400
If you follow me again,

377
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,600
I'll kill you.

378
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,800
You saved my life.

379
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,000
You can take it.

380
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,200
I admit that

381
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,000
you saved my life.

382
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,000
Come here.

383
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
Come here.

384
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Wake up.

385
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,400
Where's your home?

386
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,400
Wuyi State.

387
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,800
Pianyuan Escort.

388
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
You've been...

389
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,000
Yes.

390
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,200
I've been killed.

391
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,800
There are 74 people in the whole escort.

392
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,200
They died in one night.

393
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,000
So you don't have any other relatives?

394
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,600
Okay.

395
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,200
Then follow me.

396
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,200
But I'll tell you first.

397
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,200
I'm very troublesome.

398
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,400
Once something happens,

399
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,600
I'll run away first.

400
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
I can't care about you.

401
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,600
What's your name?

402
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,600
My name is Tong Shuang.

403
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,200
Tong Shuang.

404
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,200
I was right this morning.

405
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,600
I apologize to you.

406
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,400
Brother.

407
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,200
From the first day I came home,

408
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,600
I miss my father.

409
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,600
I remember that year was very hot.

410
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,600
I ran away like a dog.

411
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,000
Ten years.

412
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I grew up.

413
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,200
And I'm back.

414
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,400
But I don't know

415
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,200
who my enemy is.

416
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,000
I can't revenge for my father.

417
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,600
I saw what happened outside.

418
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,200
They sincerely apologized

419
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,200
because in their heart,

420
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,000
Pianyuan Escort

421
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,200
is a place worth being respected and remembered.

422
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,800
But I can't see my father.

423
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,200
Your father is gone.

424
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,200
But Pianyuan Escort is still here.

425
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,400
Escort is like this now.

426
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,600
Pianyuan Escort is remembered

427
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,200
not because of that plaque

428
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,000
or the bright door.

429
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,000
Not because of the wide yard.

430
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,600
But because of people.

431
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,800
Your father and those escort masters

432
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,800
risked their lives to protect the peace.

433
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,000
So Pianyuan Escort

434
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
has a place worth being remembered.

435
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,800
Now,

436
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,800
you're the only one left.

437
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,200
You're Pianyuan Escort.

438
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,000
When you do anything,

439
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,000
you'll be remembered by Pianyuan Escort.

440
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,800
So whether you're revenge

441
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,200
or investigation,

442
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,400
you have to bear the weight

443
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,400
of these four words.

444
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,400
I know, brother.

445
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,200
Brother.

446
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,000
I'm sorry

447
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
for what happened these days.

448
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,400
I'm sorry.

449
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,400
Can you

450
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,400
tell them about this?

451
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,400
I wonder why

452
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,000
you're here.

453
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,000
Greetings, Lord Wang.

454
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,200
Have some tea.

455
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,200
No need.

456
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,200
Is the agent of Shen Buying

457
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,600
here in Weizhou?

458
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,400
Yes.

459
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,000
How many of them?

460
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,400
I wonder why

461
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,200
you're asking about the agent.

462
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,000
You don't have to ask about Pianyuan Escort

463
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,400
when you're working in the secret camp.

464
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,800
Just answer.

465
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,600
There are five people in total.

466
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,800
Except for the agent,

467
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,000
there are

468
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,400
Mo Chong and Mo Bu Kuan.

469
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,600
Tong Zhuang and Tong Bu Kuan.

470
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
And a coroner and a girl.

471
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,000
But that girl

472
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,200
should not be here.

473
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,800
You don't have to tell them that I'm here.

474
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,800
How should we cooperate with Shen Buying in Weizhou?

475
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,800
Just cooperate.

476
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,200
Just take it as a accident.

477
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,600
I see.

478
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,600
I didn't expect you to be so good.

479
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,600
No.

480
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,200
I was lying there

481
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,000
and didn't move.

482
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,200
Miss Huo, you're good at acting.

483
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,600
You...

484
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,600
I didn't wipe it clean.

485
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,800
Let me do it.

486
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,800
I...

487
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,800
I'll give it back to you after I clean it.

488
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,600
It's okay. Let me do it.

489
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,800
I'll give it back to you after I clean it.

490
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,600
Crazy!

491
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,800
Crazy!

492
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:53,800
Crazy!

493
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,800
Oh, no!

494
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
My brother...

495
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,800
Crazy!

496
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,000
What's wrong with my brother?

497
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,600
Didn't you say the poison was cured?

498
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,200
The poison of Xiao Bei Ming

499
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,600
was not cured at all.

500
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,000
But his arm

501
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,600
must have a light blood stain.

502
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,200
Because that poison

503
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,800
has already entered his meridians.

504
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,400
I'm just a Wu Kuan who wants to find out the truth.

505
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,800
Even if I die,

506
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I'll die on the way to the investigation.

507
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,800
Say something.

508
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,800
Brother.

509
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,000
Don't blame Feng Xin Zhu.

510
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,400
I chose it myself.

511
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,800
Brother, you...

512
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,600
Why did you hide it from us?

513
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,800
Say something!

514
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,400
It's Brother Xiao who didn't let me tell you.

515
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,800
Why?

516
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,200
He's worried that you'll know

517
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,400
that he's the only one who cares about the investigation.

518
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,600
Not only can't he save his life,

519
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,400
but it will also delay the case.

520
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,800
What we're doing

521
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,400
is more important

522
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,000
than my life.

523
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,800
I'm not afraid of you.

524
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I'm not afraid of you.

525
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,200
I'm not afraid of you.

526
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,400
I'm not afraid of you.

527
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,600
It's more important.

528
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,600
It's time.

529
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,200
He's still thinking about the investigation.

530
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,800
He said

531
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,200
that on the way to the investigation,

532
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,400
it's his life.

533
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,200
Tong Shuang! Tong Shuang!

534
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,200
Tong Shuang, what are you doing?

535
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,000
Looking for Old Chou Chong.

536
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,800
Why are you looking for him?

537
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,000
He has a way to detoxify the poison.

538
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,800
Stop it!

539
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,200
Stop it!

540
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Brother is like this.

541
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,400
He has no time.

542
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,800
I know you're worried.

543
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,600
I'm more worried than you.

544
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,400
Can you find Old Chou Chong now?

545
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,600
Can you make it?

546
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,600
Then tell me what to do.

547
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,200
Can we watch him die?

548
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,400
Tong Shuang,

549
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,000
it's time.

550
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,800
Don't let Brother Xiao worry about you anymore.

551
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,800
He treats you as his own brother.

552
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,200
At this time,

553
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,200
you should stay by his side.

554
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,200
How many days are left?

555
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,200
One month.

556
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,800
It's already over half a month.

557
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,600
Sister.

558
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,000
I know.

559
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,800
I know everything.

560
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,400
You're my senior.

561
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,800
But you're Shen Buying's subordinate.

562
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,400
I know you have something to do.

563
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I'm sorry.

564
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,000
Let's talk about the case first.

565
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,600
Let's all

566
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,000
talk about the clues we found.

567
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,800
Brother, you're like this.

568
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,200
I and Feng Wu

569
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,000
don't have anything else strange.

570
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,800
But the medicine for blood transfusion

571
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,000
has been sold out.

572
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,200
I don't have this either.

573
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,600
I'm afraid the whole Weizhou City

574
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,600
has nothing.

575
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,600
It seems to have been bought by a mysterious rich businessman.

576
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,000
Sister,

577
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,000
what did you find?

578
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,400
I talked to the customers of Tea House,

579
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,200
Yang Chun House for a day.

580
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,400
It sounds like

581
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,200
there is a strange thing recently.

582
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,400
A son is old.

583
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,400
Recently, a group of foreign rich businessmen came to Weizhou.

584
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,600
They have no children

585
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,400
but want to adopt their parents.

586
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,400
They have a filial son.

587
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,400
A son is serving his parents.

588
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,800
When his parents return to the heaven,

589
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,400
he will leave his family business to his son.

590
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,400
I also found out that they recently

591
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,800
booked a salt business meeting

592
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,200
to recruit a son.

593
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,600
It is said that the conditions of the assessment are very strict.

594
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,600
There are family members

595
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,000
or double relatives

596
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
who are unfamiliar with it.

597
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,000
So most of the people who came to the school

598
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,200
are some shepherds and beggars.

599
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:18,800
By the way,

600
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,600
the rich businessman who bought the medicine

601
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,800
also lives in the salt business meeting.

602
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,000
There are a lot of people who care about the medicine for blood transfusion.

603
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,200
But the medicine shop is different.

604
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,600
The shop is empty.

605
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,400
Some people go to the salt business meeting.

606
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,200
It is possible that the heaven will raise people first.

607
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,200
They will be treated with blood first.

608
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,800
When the time is right,

609
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,800
they will be trained.

610
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,800
Then who are those people?

611
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,800
A son is old.

612
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,400
It is very possible that it is the heaven's trap.

613
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,200
There is also violence.

614
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,000
The king of the fake king

615
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,800
is killing people.

616
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,200
Most of the people who went to the salt business meeting

617
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,600
are shepherds and beggars without double relatives.

618
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,200
Even if they disappear,

619
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,800
no one will protect them even if they die.

620
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,400
What should we do next?

621
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,400
The best way now

622
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,000
is to have someone pretend to be a son

623
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,600
and go to the salt business meeting

624
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,800
to find out the truth.

625
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,200
I'll go.

626
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,000
No.

627
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,400
You are from Weizhou.

628
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,800
You will be found out.

629
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,200
I'll go.

630
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,400
I can dress up as a man.

631
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,800
The situation is unclear.

632
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,800
It is easy to be found out if you dress up as a man.

633
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:22,800
I'll go.

634
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,600
How can you do that?

635
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Your martial arts are too poor.

636
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,200
If you are found out,

637
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,400
it will be difficult to protect yourself.

638
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,400
You are timid.

639
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,600
If you are exposed,

640
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,600
it will be more troublesome.

641
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,600
I am not good at martial arts.

642
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,400
But I am going to pretend to be a son

643
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,400
and not to fight and rob.

644
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Compared to you,

645
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,400
I am a little timid.

646
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,200
I am not brave enough to fight and kill.

647
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,200
But I am definitely brave enough to go to the salt business meeting.

648
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,400
Don't worry.

649
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,600
Besides, if you want to succeed in this matter,

650
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,200
you have to be careful.

651
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,600
I am a coroner.

652
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,000
I am more careful than Xinxin.

653
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,000
No one can compare to me.

654
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,000
No one is more suitable than me.

655
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,800
Brother.

656
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,800
I'll go.

657
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,800
Then do as Feng Wu said.

658
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,000
Sister Huo.

659
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,800
Help Feng Wu cover up the wound.

660
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,600
Tong Shuang.

661
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,200
Go to the salt business meeting and visit.

662
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,200
See if there are any places

663
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,400
suitable for ambush outside.

664
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,600
In case something really happens,

665
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,600
we should go to save people as soon as possible.

666
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,200
You can go.

667
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,600
What you are doing

668
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,800
is more useful to me

669
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,400
than any antidote in the world.

670
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,800
I am waiting for you to come back.

671
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,000
Brother.

672
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,200
Tong Shuang.

673
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I believe you.

674
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,200
Okay.

675
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Feng Wu Ze.

676
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,200
Don't think too much.

677
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,000
We are here.

678
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,600
Don't be afraid.

679
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,800
What's there to be afraid of?

680
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,600
I am afraid...

681
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,200
I won't have a chance to do more for you.

682
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,800
I'll go first.

683
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,600
Brother.

684
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,400
I...

685
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,600
I think Old Chou Chou

686
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,800
is just trying to escape.

687
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,800
He is eavesdropping.

688
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,800
You are not the only one who is in danger.

689
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,400
Just rest in peace.

690
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,200
I have told Uncle Hai.

691
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,800
If you still feel cold,

692
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,400
I'll make you a fire.

693
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,000
Don't worry about it.

694
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,000
I am here.

695
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:23,200
If I could give you a glance at a face,

696
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:27,400
it is an unforgettable fate.

697
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,400
If there is a tender heart,

698
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,600
the thoughts will be remembered.

699
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:38,600
Write a poem about that night.

700
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:44,000
If I could look at you and think about the past,

701
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,600
why didn't I believe you?

702
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,400
If I had believed you earlier,

703
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,200
you wouldn't have...

704
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,600
I never blamed you.

705
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,400
I also want to thank you

706
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,800
for saving my life

707
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,600
and giving me the last chance to survive.

708
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,400
Are you happy?

709
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,000
Your poison

710
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,200
has finished my big heart.

711
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,400
No matter the trip to Weizhou goes well or not,

712
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,400
as long as we have enough time,

713
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,000
I will help you with the case.

714
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,000
Of course I am happy.

715
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,600
Are you worried about something?

716
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,800
No.

717
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,200
I am just worried about the trip to Weizhou.

718
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,200
There is nothing to worry about.

719
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,800
Maybe we can catch Ye Sha this time.

720
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Let's hope so.

721
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,000
It's not a wish.

722
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,200
It's a must.

723
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,400
Brother Xiao

724
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,400
is still guilty and wronged.

725
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,200
When he is cleared of his guilt,

726
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,000
everything will be fine.

727
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,600
I will wait for him.

728
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,200
Mr.

729
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,400
Mr.

730
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,400
Mr.

731
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,800
Have you found out the whereabouts of the snowman?

732
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,800
Mr.

733
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,200
Weizhou is too big.

734
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,600
It's no wonder that we can't find it in the sea.

735
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,400
They are here to find the sick horse.

736
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,400
Is there a whereabouts of the horse farm?

737
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,800
I found the horse farm.

738
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,200
The magazine said

739
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,200
there was a man and a woman

740
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,400
who looked like Feng Qingzhuo.

741
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,600
But the woman

742
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,000
described by Zha Yi

743
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,200
is not as tall as the snowman.

744
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,800
She is not as tall as the snowman.

745
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,800
And Zha Yi

746
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,800
doesn't know

747
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,600
where the woman and man are.

748
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,200
Mr.

749
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,600
Should we send more people to come here?

750
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,800
We two...

751
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I know a place

752
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,400
where we can find them.

753
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,400
Mr.

754
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,200
Do you want me to find out?

755
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,400
We don't have to do anything.

756
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,600
We just need to keep an eye on them.

757
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,800
Yes.

758
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,600
