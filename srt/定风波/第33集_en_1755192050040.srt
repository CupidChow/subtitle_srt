[Episode 33]

3
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,970
He still didn't eat anything.

4
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,840
What is the matter?

5
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,509
He only told us

6
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,070
not to disturb him

7
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,730
until Zhuge Kongyun returns.

8
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,400
I don't know what happened.

9
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,000
He's been in there for days.

10
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,430
Shall we go check on him?

11
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,520
-Young Master.
-Young Master.

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,960
Is he in there?

13
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,430
Young Master.

14
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,030
Yes.

15
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,960
It is confirmed.

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,200
You guessed it right.

17
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,150
[Yesha]

18
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,590
I remember one thing

19
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,400
said by King Zhong of Constables.

20
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,430
When all the impossibilities are excluded,

21
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,400
what remains—

22
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,120
though you may not believe it—

23
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,910
must be the truth.

24
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,360
He looked like a young man.

25
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,190
Judging from the physique,

26
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,100
that was probably a middle-aged man.

27
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,190
He showed up every time
with his face covered.

28
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:49,810

00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,400
I couldn't see what he really looked like.

00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,460
[Yesha]

32
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,560
On the right side of his eye,

33
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,760
there's a black mole.

34
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:54,610
Beiming,

35
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,400
have you discovered something?

36
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,520
Yesha is Xiao Beiming.

37
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,310
But he's probably dead now.

38
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,510
Master is a divinity.

39
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,910
He never dies.

40
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:02,630
In fact,

41
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,430
every Haiya survivor

42
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,310
is Yesha.

[Haiya orphans]

45
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,870
I haven't fulfilled my duty as a father.

46
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,400
Now, I trust my children to your care.

47
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,470
Was the collapse
of Bei Hai's underground tomb

48
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,120
planned

49
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,360
by the second Yesha

50
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,310
to kill all of us?

51
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,190
But could anyone

52
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,150
have followed us,

53
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,400
escaped all mechanisms,

54
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,750
and remained undetected?

55
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,870
How could he have possibly done all that?

56
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,310
Instead of his ability,

57
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,510
timing was the point.

58
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,520
I've figured out

59
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,750
who the new Yesha is.

60
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,960
Who exactly?

61
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,300
The whole story

62
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,800
started after the Haiya Case.

63
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,120
As we previously deduced,

64
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,030
the Canfeng Army committed

65
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,150
severe crimes in Haiya.

66
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,400
Miao Jie returned to
the Imperial Secretariat

67
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,680
with bitter enmity,

68
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,430
planning to avenge Haiya people.

69
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,820
Being well aware that he couldn't

70
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,420
complete the revenge alone,

71
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,160
he began grooming a successor.

72
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,400
But the one he chose pretended to be

73
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,750
mentally challenged.

74
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,520
Right.

75
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:56,900
I bet he considered

76
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,460
[Miao Yun]

77
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,360
killing Miao Yun.

78
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,960
But he couldn't bring himself to do it,

79
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,760
since they were both from Haiya.

80
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,000
So, he made a risky decision

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,400
of sending Miao Yun away,

82
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,610
leaving him to fend for himself.

83
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,920
[Miao Yun]

84
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,430
And then?

85
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,810
Then, he started

86
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,000
training a new successor.

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,630
That was the very beginning of

88
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,130
the deaths of the Canfeng Army members

89
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,390
recorded in the Haiya orphan registry.

90
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,600
Those Haiya orphans were

91
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,040
taken away one after another.

92
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,310
He meant to select one of the orphans

93
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,240
to be the new Yesha?

94
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,840
I guess I was a candidate too.

95
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,920
But Master's protection

96
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,040
for me

97
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,870
denied him any chance to make a move.

98
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,040
However, eventually,

99
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,870
he still found an ideal successor.

100
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,470
That child was just like him,

101
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,000
as they both harbored deadly hatred.

102
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,240
The child was brutal, heartless,

103
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,840
and extremely intelligent.

104
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,800
Then, they started

105
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,400
planning for the first case.

106
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,270
That very case led to

107
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,560
all the events we knew of later.

108
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,070
Which case was it?

109
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,130
Pingyuan Escort Agency...

110
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,390
One thing has been bewildering me.

111
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,390
As part of his revenge,

112
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,000
Miao Jie killed many of
the Canfeng Army members
involved in the slaughter

113
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,830
and the officials
who suggested this ruthless act.

114
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,040
But he only killed the people of interest

115
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,480
and spared their families.

116
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,480
There is only one explanation for it—

117
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,410
he had to conceal the real identity

118
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,770
of the child he chose.

119
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:09,800
Dead people

120
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,500
can't be suspects.

[Tong Xin] [Male Infant]
[Tong Peng]

122
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,800
The child he picked

123
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,070
was Tong Shuang.

124
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,830
How could that be possible?

125
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,630
You're saying Tong Shuang is...

126
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,750
I've been wondering about one thing.

127
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,360
How did the new Yesha get to know

128
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,480
each move of our plan,

129
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,220
including the time

130
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,430
we set off for Haiya?

131
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,580
That secret complaint letter of misconduct

132
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,120
against Chief Fang was delivered

133
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,600
to the Secret Investigation Unit

134
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,130
precisely
before we returned to the capital.

135
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,750
There could only be one reason—

136
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,240
that person has been around us
the entire time.

137
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,040
Impossible.

138
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,830
Absolutely impossible.

139
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,360
I know

140
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,940
you find it unbelievable.

141
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,600
But during my visit to Weizhou...

142
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,210
The second young master Tong Peng

143
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,400

Nobody knows who his mother is.

146
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,430
The third young master was about

147
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,830
the second one's age at that time.

148
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,950

provoke the second young master.

can you take me

[Tomb of Tong Peng]

00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,430
Look at this...

00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,240
How do we explain it to Master?

161
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,120
I remember these two brothers

162
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,320
once got into a fight.

163
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,600
The second young master

164
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,680
pushed the third young master
to the ground.

165

The third young master's right arm broke.

166
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,870
His right arm bone

167
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,560
is noticeably thinner than the left one,

168
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,070
which means his right arm

169
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,390
was injured before he died.

170
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,190
Children's bones grow quickly.

171
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,000
This kid's injured right arm

172
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,240
wasn't able to move for a long time.

His right arm bone

174
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:04,800
became

175
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,310
like this after it healed.

176
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,270
Mr. Hai,

177
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,000
if your memory

serves you right about that fight,

179
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,570
then I can conclude

180
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,560
that the boy in this coffin
is not Tong Peng,

181
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,750
but Tong Shuang,

00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,050
to a house,

194
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,240
which was surrounded by mountains.

195
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,360
If my guess is right,

196
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,190
the person
who poisoned and killed Mr. Shen

197
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,120
was the man who was with him

198
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,560
the whole time—Tong Shuang.

199
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,600
Do you remember who was with Qing Ying

200
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,630
when she died?

201
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,920
What exactly happened

202
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,000
in Haiya back then?

203
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,270
Do you think I'm a spineless coward

204
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,480
like Zhu Yitie?

205
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,190
I won't say anything.

206
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,680
Do you remember who was the last person

207
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,540
Huang Wuchang met before he died?

208
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,800
Attack!

209
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,410
Could those be coincidences?

210
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,370
These incidents aren't enough to prove

211
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:31,970
that their deaths

212
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,720
were orchestrated by Tong Shuang.

213
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,630
What Beiming said

214
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,690
is probably right.

215
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,000
When I untied Tong Shuang,

216
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,630
I noticed the rope marks were very light.

217
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,960
I didn't give it too much thought.

218
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,080
But now that I think about it,

219
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,270
if he had been tied during the long time

220
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,600
he was held as hostage,

221
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,750
the marks would've been deep,

222
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,320
and there might have been bruises.

223
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,840
But the situation was the opposite.

224
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,910
Are you suggesting

225
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,880
that he didn't tie himself up

226
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,090
until he realized

227
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,840
we were about to reach the peak?

228
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,170
Besides, Huang Wuchang

229
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,700
committed suicide without hesitation.

230
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,960
If I'm not mistaken,

231
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,240
they must have discovered

232
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,440
Bei Hai's underground tomb

233
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,370
and even entered it more than once.

234
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,200
Given their capability,

235
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,080
it wouldn't be difficult for them

236
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,600
to solve

237
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,720
the three riddles there.

238
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,440
But since they didn't have the key,

239
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,310
they failed to access

240
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,370
the inner chamber.

241
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,960
So, he approached you

242
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,510
in order to find the key.

243
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,030
Miao Jie knew

244
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,290
Master was the person

245
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,150
who Bei Hai last met.

246
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,060
If that key

247
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,230
truly exists,

248
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,400
Bei Hai must've

249
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,690
given it to Master.

250
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,720
After Master died,

251
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,820
they couldn't find this key

252
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,670
even after searching
the entire Elite Constabulary Unit.

253
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,000
If I were Yesha,

254
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,150
I would also assume

255
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,170
Master gave me the key

256
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:29,960
in the end.

257
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,970
So, the explosion
in the underground tomb that day

258
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,600
was triggered by his people

259
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,400
who he planted there in advance.

260
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,330
He already got

261
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,530
what he wanted.

262
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,450
Faking his own death

263
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,810
under the fallen rocks

264
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,790
was his final escape plan.

265
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,390
After all, none of us

266
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,980
have really seen his body.

267
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,910
What he wanted to get...

268
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,550
It was the Swift Wind Pills.

269
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,040
He made us go to Haiya

270
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,210
because he believed

271
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,510
there were Swift Wind Pills left

272
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,200
in that secret chamber.

273
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:00,910
This is bad.

274
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,540
Now, he has the formula

275
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,770
of the Swift Wind Pills.

276
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,370
What he wants

277
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,490
more than anything now is...

278
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,950
To take the final revenge.

279
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,690
[Zhu Yitie] [Huang Wuchang]
[Swift Wind Pills]

280
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,410
I disagree.

281
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,260
This is essentially a gamble.

282
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,930
Once we start doing this,

283
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,050
there will be

284
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,050
no returning.

285
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,510
Do we have another choice?

286
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,490
We have no choice.

287
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,770
We have to take this gamble.

288
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,080
What's the urgent matter
that brings you here?

289
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,880
Your Majesty,

290
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,770
the Secret Investigation Unit has found

291
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,370
trails of Xiao Beiming.

292
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,320
Where is he?

293
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,490
He is not in custody.

294
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:40,050
Instead, he is waiting outside the hall.

295
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:42,920
Outside?

296
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:43,810
Your Majesty,

297
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,370
the Secret Investigation Unit

298
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,800
has obtained new evidence

299
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,650
on the case regarding Yesha.

300
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:50,490
Now, it is confirmed

301
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,290
that Xiao Beiming is not Yesha,

302
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,680
and that the crimes he is accused of

303
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,490
are false accusations.

304
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:56,920
What do you mean?

305
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,250
Your Majesty,

306
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,680
since the Fengbo Lake case,

307
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,320
Xiao Beiming has been wronged

308
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,650
and on the run for three years,

309
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:04,490
adamantly looking for evidence

310
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,490
to clear his name.

311
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,130
Chief Fang

312
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,840
believed the proof he presented,

313
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,650
so he risked his life

314
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,770
to release Xiao

315
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,050
in order to verify the truth.

316
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,170
Since the truth has been revealed now,

317
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,600
Xiao Beiming is
voluntarily surrendering himself.

318
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,200
The truth has been revealed?

319
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,650
What exactly is it?

320
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:21,410
Xiao Beiming's findings

321
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,650
are inconceivable,

322
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,770
astounding,

323
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,440
and far beyond my imagination.

324
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,680
The Yesha case has wide implications.

325
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,600
It is even related to

326
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,170
the safety of the Qi Kingdom.

327
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,050
We couldn't come up with
a final resolution.

328
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,250
After deliberation,

329
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,080
we decided to bring Xiao Beiming here

330
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,300
to meet Your Majesty.

331
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,730
We long for an imperial edict
from Your Majesty

332
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,390
after hearing his statement.

333
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,920
Do you two believe

334
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,410
Xiao Beiming?

335
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:53,920
Bring him in.

336
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:55,980
Yes.

337
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:32,070
This humble commoner Xiao Beiming
pays respects to Your Majesty.

338
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,880
Rise.

339
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,480
Thank Your Majesty.

340
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,050
Remove his shackles.

341
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:48,170
I'm afraid it's inappropriate,
Your Majesty.

342
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,200
How is it inappropriate?

343
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,440
Both the Elite Constabulary Unit
and the Secret Investigation Unit

344
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,950
are working to clear this man's name now.

345
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:53,840
I'd trust these two divisions

346
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,340
of the Ministry of Justice,

347
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:58,340
even if I don't believe Xiao Beiming,
don't you think?

348
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,730
Thank Your Majesty.

349
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,050
Long time no see, Xiao Beiming.

350
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,410
You look haggard now,

351
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,600
unlike what you used to be—

352
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,080
a spirited young man.

353
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,600
I haven't been faired well.

354
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,400
I feel so blessed to have a chance

355
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,940
to speak for myself before Your Majesty.

356
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,410
They all say you were wronged.

357
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,530
How exactly were you treated unjustly?

358
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:37,290
How is Yesha related to

359
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,800
the safety of the Qi Kingdom?

360
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,880
Your Majesty,

361
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,460
do you know about Haiya?

362
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,390
You seem to have known it all along.

363
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,650
Eunuch Wang.

364
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:54,290
Yes.

365
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:56,500
All of you,

366
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,320
leave now.

367
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,200
Yes.

368
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,530
How did you get to know about

369
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,200
that place?

370
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,660
Not only do I have knowledge of it,

371
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,010
I've also been there myself

372
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,720
in quest of the truth.

373
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,200
I already learned

374
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:21,060
what happened 20 years ago,

375
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,530
namely the history
that the Qi Kingdom tries to cover up.

376
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,610
How could you possibly have been there?

377
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:31,560
Haiya was already...

378
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,320
Burned and concealed.

379
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,380
Even erased by the Qi Kingdom, right?

380
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,230
It didn't cease to be.

381
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,250
On top of that,

00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,210
No.

756
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:45,450
Have you seen this man?

757
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,120
No.

758
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:47,080
Seen him?

759
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:47,640
Have you seen this guy?

760
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,360
Never.

761
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:56,360
Xueman.

762
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,370
Beiming, what brings you here?

763
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:41,320
Let's go.

764
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:53,730
Are you saying His Majesty

765
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:55,560
has pardoned Xiao Beiming

766
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,080
and Fang Tianzheng,

767
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,400
reinstated them to their old jobs,

768
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,560
and put Xiao Beiming

769
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,360
in charge of the Yesha case?

770
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:04,360
Yes, My Lord.

771
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:07,050
I can't believe

772
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:08,770
he did make it happen.

773
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,640
Yesha's identity has been confirmed.

774
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,300
His wanted posters
are all over the streets now.

775
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,640
Mr. Wu.

776
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,080
Come in.

777
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,610
Does the portrait look like me?

778
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,730
Mr. Wu, don't be afraid.

779
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:57,970
I'm here

780
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:00,050
to simply ask you for a favor.

781
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,730
Bravo! Bravo!

782
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:02,010
Look,

783
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,360
the pattern on the flags

784
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,620
seems to have changed.

785
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,530
The talisman...

786
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,440
Why is it different from before?

787
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:13,550
All four symbols turned demonic.

788
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:16,050
The Qi Kingdom is going to collapse!

789
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,080
Yesha has descended.

790
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,560
The world will be in his reign!

791
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,600
All four symbols turned demonic.

792
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,160
The Qi Kingdom is going to collapse!

793
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,530
Yesha has descended.

794
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:31,080
The world will be in his reign!

795
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:45,600
Why is there a tiger?

796
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,530
There's a tiger!

797
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,800
A tiger!

798
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:52,400
What's going on?

799
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:01,730
Mr. Wu!

800
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:02,840
Mr. Wu!

801
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,480
-His uniform...
-Mr. Wu!

802
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,970
All four symbols turned demonic.

803
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:08,600
The White Tiger...

804
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,560
The White Tiger killed a man!

805
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,770
The White Tiger killed a man!

806
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:12,360
The White Tiger killed a man!

807
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,880
A man died! A man died!

808
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:17,050
Secure the area!

809
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:51,970
What did you find?

810
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:54,080
All his bones are fractured,

811
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,340
and organs displaced.

812
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,750
He must've died in a fall from height.

813
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,880
But these lacerations and puncture wounds

814
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,560
appeared before his death.

815
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,330
What caused these injuries?

816
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:04,690
Beasts.

817
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:06,290
Fierce beasts

818
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,360
with sharp claws and fangs.

819
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:09,800
Animals like tigers and leopards

820
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,290
with sharp teeth and claws

821
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:13,530
could cause these injuries
by biting and mauling.

822
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:14,160
Did you really

823
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,560
see a tiger in the clouds?

824
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,090
Not just us,

825
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:18,860
everyone saw it.

826
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,050
A tiger flew into the sky to kill a man...

827
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:22,400
How could that be possible?

828
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,530
I'm puzzled too.

829
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,490
Were those dancing in the street

830
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,950
from your theater troupe?

831
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,360
Are you the leader?

832
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:38,970
Yes, I am.

833
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,550
Get up and talk to us.

834
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:43,010
I was just frightened at the sight of you,

835
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:43,560
officers.

836
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,560
You didn't do anything wrong.

837
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,490
Why so afraid?

838
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:47,640
Officers,

839
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,290
we're just performers.

840
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:50,690
We got paid to perform

841
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:52,120
a sacrificial ritual for the Four Symbols.

842
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,800
As for what exactly happened,

843
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,210
we have no idea at all.

844
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:57,530
You'd better be honest.

845
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:58,840
You're the troupe leader.

846
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,880
How could you not know

847
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,770
who paid you for this job?

848
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:02,010
I really don't know.

849
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:03,650
A few days ago, when I woke up,

850
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,840
I found a box at my door,

851
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:07,120
plus a tael of gold.

852
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,280
There was a letter,

853
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,929
specifying the time and place
for our dance.

854
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:11,409
I really don't know

855
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,639
who planned all that.

856
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,159
You took that job

857
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,489
without meeting your patron?

858
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:16,120
Officer,

859
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,929
one tael of gold is no small sum.

860
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:19,560
It's as much as our earnings
in six months.

861
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,330
Besides,

862
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:21,679
it was just a dance.

863
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,449
We were not

864
00:34:22,449 --> 00:34:23,810
asked to kill or set fires.

865
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:25,280
What reason did I have to turn it down?

866
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,530
We just didn't expect

867
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:28,130
those terrible happenings.

868
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,969
Those weird flags

869
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:31,850
were placed

870
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:32,760
in the box too.

871
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:37,889
Sign your statement now.

872
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,199
Look at this flag.

873
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,600
What's special about it?

874
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,450
The pattern

875
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,410
was painted with dye

876
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:06,850
made from Ziyang Grass.

877
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,470
How knowledgeable of you.

878
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,010
Ziyang Grass is usually green,

879
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:13,010
but it turns red when there's heat.

880
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:14,240
As the dancers

881
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,840
waved the flags in sunlight,

882
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:16,720
the pattern

883
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,760
would change.

884
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:20,490
Just hocus-pocus.

885
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:21,810
This must be

886
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,080
his doing.

887
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,080
He wouldn't easily give himself away.

888
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,680
There's no use
asking the troupe leader anymore.

889
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,080
It's time to release him.

890
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,370
Is there

891
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:38,890
a hallucinogenic drug

892
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:40,010
that can make a crowd of people

893
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,490
have the same illusion?

894
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,410
All sorts of peculiar things

895
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:44,810
exist in this vast world.

896
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,890
Some hallucinogens

897
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:48,590
like the red crystal we know of

898
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,080
can induce

899
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,080
hallucinations.

900
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:52,850
But I haven't heard of any drugs

901
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,650
that can cause the same illusion

902
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,080
among a group of people.

903
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,200
Right.

904
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,240
The White Tiger killer

905
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,680
was all a ruse

906
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,890
just like the flags.

907
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,280
We just haven't figured out

908
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,450
their connections.

909
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:05,510
We know it was just deceit,

910
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,280
but what do the people think?

911
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,560
Now those lines

912
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,720
and the White Tiger's killing

913
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,050
have reached every corner of the capital.

914
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,240
Many people

915
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,490
believe that Yesha is sent

916
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:14,410
by the divine beings

917
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:15,850
to save the world.

918
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:16,680
At this rate,

919
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,160
there will be serious disruption.

920
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,160
I'm afraid this is what he'd like to see.

921
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,120
Killing Mr. Wu

922
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,240
in broad daylight

923
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,210
was equal to declaring war on us.

924
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:26,010
Beiming,

925
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,810
what's on your mind?

926
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,410
"Four symbols transform into demons."

927
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:31,720
"Yesha has descended."

928
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,160
"The world will be in his reign."

929
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,560
What's with these lines?

930
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,890
"Four symbols transform into demons."

931
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,410
Now, the White Tiger already took a life.

932
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:38,410
It means

933
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:40,120
three more murders will happen.

934
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,450
Three more?

935
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,010
This is the tricky part.

936
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,280
Yesha is lurking in the dark.

937
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,850
We know he's in the capital

938
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:46,720
and what he plans

939
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,600
to do next,

940
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,970
but we have no idea

941
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,760
when and where

942
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:52,050
he'll strike at whom.

943
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,280
Worst case scenario—

944
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,850
we'll have to wait till a case happens

945
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:55,720
