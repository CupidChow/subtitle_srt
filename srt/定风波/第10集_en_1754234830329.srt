Isn't she?

You are our

7
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,200
rather unscrupulous butterfly

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:40,960
up in the sky.

maybe

15
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,520
you don't bothering to tell

16
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,960
When you find it,

17
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,760
you can't pull it out.

18
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,720
You keep doing as planned.

19
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,040
Yes.

Episode 16

25
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,720
When Master was young,

26
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,080
he killed enemies on the battlefield.

27
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,680
I don't know how many wounds he got

28
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,920
and how many sick spots he got.

29
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,360
Usually,

30
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,720
he used these tonics to take care of his body.

31
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,120
But he was killed by a man.

32
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,320
He was killed by a man.

00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,520

00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,720
He was killed by a man.

40
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,920

00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,520
He was killed by a man.

49
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,720
He was killed by a man.

50
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,920

57
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,320
He was killed by a man.

58
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,520

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,720
He was killed by a man.

61
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,920
What Miss Huo said

62
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,120
has no doubt about it.

63
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,920
Miss Huo is the only daughter of the Huo family.

64
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,120
Is there anyone in this mansion

65
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,320
who can hurt you?

66
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,720
a woman who is unquestionable.

67
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,800
It seems that Madam Feng is awake.

68
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,320
Since Madam Feng is awake,

69
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,600
is it convenient to see her?

70
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,080
Madam Feng is not in good health.

71
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,320
She has been over-sad these days.

72
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,040
I'm afraid...

73
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,840
No.

74
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,320
Please wait a moment.

75
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,120
How is it?

76
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,160
I can't see anything for now.

77
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,080
I need to take all these drugs back for testing

78
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,160
to get a conclusion.

79
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,560
Where is Zhong Bukui?

80
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,240
Zhong Bukui and Tong Bukui

81
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,480
are asking around in the Eastern Courtyard.

82
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,680
Tong Bukui?

83
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,400
You've met him before?

84
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,360
Tong Shuang?

85
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,200
Let's go.

86
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,320
Take me to see them.

87
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,640
Wait.

88
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,600
Wait.

89
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,880
I'll take a few more bottles of drugs.

90
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,040
To test them more.

91
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,000
To test them more.

92
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,320
Take that too.

93
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,240
Let's go.

94
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,240
This way, please.

95
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,960
This way, please.

96
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,720
Why hasn't she come yet?

97
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,440
It's almost time.

98
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,640
It's time to see Xiao Man.

99
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:36,880
Wait!

100
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,880
Madam Feng, what's wrong?

101
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,960
I think I forgot something.

102
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,120
What's that?

103
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,440
The token of the Divine Camp.

104
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,080
Why don't you two

105
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,440
go back and get it with me?

106
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,280
Let's go.

107
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,520
Go back by yourself.

108
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,880
Please.

109
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,200
Ouch!

110
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,560
Madam Feng, are you okay?

111
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,400
I'm fine.

112
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,640
I'm fine.

113
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,120
Look at me.

114
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,240
I'm so careless.

115
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,560
These are all objects.

116
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,960
What should I do?

117
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,480
It'll be fine soon.

118
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,640
The Demon King

119
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,040
You are...

120
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,600
Mr. Chu Ge, are you okay?

121
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,720
Mr. Chu Ge, are you okay?

122
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,680
Where's Mao Zao?

123
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,680
I'll take you there.

124
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,960
That way.

125
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,360
I'll...

126
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,040
Hurry up.

127
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,040
Madam Feng is so sad for General Huo.

128
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,080
It seems that you two are close.

129
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,760
Yes.

130
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,400
When General Huo came back from the battlefield,

131
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,560
he took me as his concubine.

132
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,800
It's been 23 years.

133
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,160
These years,

134
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,440
we've been close to each other.

135
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,440
We're very close.

136
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,920
Now that he's gone,

137
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,360
my heart

138
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,440
hurts so much.

139
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,720
I'm so worried.

140
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,520
Madam Feng.

141
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,840
My mother is very weak now.

142
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,840
If there's nothing wrong with you two,

143
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,760
then...

144
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,240
Thank you, Madam Feng and Miss Huo.

145
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,520
Sorry for the interruption.

146
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,680
We should leave now.

147
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,920
We're sorry for the inconvenience.

148
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,400
Take care, sirs.

149
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,560
Li Xiao took her to the toilet.

150
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm afraid it won't be long.

151
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You should leave now.

152
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,720
We'll hold off Zhuge Kongyun.

153
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,440
You should leave now.

154
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,800
We'll meet at the third floor.

155
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,160
Tong Bukui.

156
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,640
Miss Huo.

157
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,480
Didn't Tong Bukui

158
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,040
stay with Zhong Bukui?

159
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,640
Why are they acting separately now?

160
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,320
I have something important to do.

161
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,280
I need to go back to the camp.

162
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,320
Miss Huo,

163
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,320
you're here.

164
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,600
You have something to ask me.

165
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,840
I've been thinking.

166
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,040
I'm afraid the person in front of me is not Tong Bukui.

167
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,040
She's the old friend

168
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,240
I mentioned earlier.

169
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,640
Miss Huo,

170
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,840
we haven't met before.

171
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,000
You must have mistaken her for someone else.

172
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm not good at learning

173
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,800
and I'm not good at martial arts.

174
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,240
But I know a little bit about dressing up.

175
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,200
Besides,

176
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,880
your eyes

177
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,040
are so familiar to me.

178
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,040
So...

179
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:54,760
Miss Huo,

180
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,840
you've mistaken me for someone else.

181
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,520
It's been a long time,

182
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,600
Xiao Beiming.

183
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,880
We've met before.

184
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,320
I'm a little embarrassed to say this.

185
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,440
I was not very fond of

186
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,920
Xiao Shen before.

187
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,720
I know your case

188
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,120
very well.

189
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,920
I've secretly

190
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,840
seen you at the gate of Shen Buying several times.

191
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,680
Since you know my identity,

192
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,440
aren't you afraid that I'll kill you?

193
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,920
I don't believe you're Ye Sha.

194
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,480
Why do you say that?

195
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,880
Because Zhong Xue Man has been by your side.

196
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,360
You're really something.

197
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,320
You can even think of this.

198
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,520
Brother Xiao is amazing.

199
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,480
He's always thinking about

200
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,520
the person in front of the camp.

201
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,520
He's amazing.

202
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,960
Here it comes.

203
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,040
Mr. Zhuge.

204
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,240
What's wrong?

205
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,120
Mr. Zhuge,

206
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,040
what's wrong with you?

207
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:17,260
This is called the

208
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,920
I did it.

209
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,760
The pill.

210
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,240
Look at my memory.

211
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,640
I forgot to tell you.

212
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,680
That Juewei Pill

213
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,120
can seal your sense of taste and sense of smell.

214
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,200
But some people

215
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,400
have other symptoms.

216
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,640
What symptoms?

217
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,160
I don't know.

218
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,760
How can you

219
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,400
give Mr. Zhuge

220
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,080
this kind of food?

221
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,960
I don't want to give it to him either.

222
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,680
He can't stand the smell of the wet food.

223
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,960
That's why I gave him food.

224
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,680
But it's just wet food.

225
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,560
Everyone is happy.

226
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,120
Yes.

227
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,280
You can't stand this.

228
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:48,920
Yes.

229
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,640
And you have to take medicine.

230
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,800
You...

231
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,440
You...

232
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,000
It's okay, Mr. Zhuge.

233
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,360
You just need to clean it.

234
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,520
When you're clean tomorrow,

235
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,720
we'll talk about the case.

236
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,120
No matter who hates you the most

237
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,120
and wants to kill you the most,

238
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,040
it's not him.

239
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,160
But he's been with you

240
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,200
and taking risks with you.

241
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,800
It means you've got his trust.

242
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,560
Since he can do it,

243
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,920
why can't I?

244
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,280
You're really smart.

245
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,240
I'm so honored

246
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,680
to be praised by you.

247
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:27,960
But

248
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,360
I have something to tell you.

249
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,720
I hope you can tell me the truth.

250
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,680
Please.

251
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,640
You're a criminal now.

252
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,560
Why are you so sad

253
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,520
about my father's case?

254
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,680
You even risked your life

255
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,800
to investigate the Huo Mansion.

256
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,560
There must be something wrong with it.

257
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,480
Could it be

258
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,680
that my father's case

259
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,920
is related to Feng Bo Lake?

260
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,360
Yes.

261
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,360
We found out that General Huo

262
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,560
is related to our clues.

263
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,080
When we first came to Huo Mansion,

264
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,600
General Huo died.

265
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,560
It's too coincidental.

266
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,840
It's hard to avoid people's doubts.

267
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,320
But...

268
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,720
But my father

269
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,520
killed himself.

270
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,680
He also took the blame.

271
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,560
He might not be the one to blame.

272
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,720
Mr. Li.

273
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,280
Someone's here.

274
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,480
Someone's guarding the front.

275
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,820
There's a

276
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,480
I have an idea. Come with me.

277
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,400
The Huo family has a lot of mothers.

278
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,040
Especially that Miss Huo.

279
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,520
She's very quiet.

280
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,240
Really?

281
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,480
I think it's okay.

282
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,800
I found that you always

283
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,200
spoke for Miss Huo.

284
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,480
No.

285
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,640
Hmm.

286
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,280
Why didn't Brother Xiao come back?

287
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,400
He said he would come back

288
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,280
earlier than us.

289
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,040
Did something happen?

290
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,040
Brother Zhu found out?

291
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,400
Young Master, are you feeling better?

292
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,640
I'm fine.

293
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,760
Brother Zhu, go back and rest.

294
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,640
I'll be with you if you need me.

295
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:14,920
Uncle Wu.

296
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,560
Why are you here at this time?

297
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,680
Okay, okay. Let's go.

298
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,480
Why are you dressed like this?

299
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,680
Huo Dai Rong dressed me up

300
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,280
to avoid the tea sweat of the Chinesechina.

301
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,320
Huo Dai Rong?

302
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,200
He...

303
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,760
He exposed my identity.

304
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,000
What?

305
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,520
He recognized you

306
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,000
and helped you escape?

307
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,800
You two are really good friends, aren't you?

308
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,040
I...

309
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,600
I really haven't seen him before.

310
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,920
I swear I really haven't seen him.

311
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,320
Brother Xiao,

312
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,800
why did he help you?

313
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,160
He asked me to help him find out

314
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,520
the truth of his father's death.

315
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,200
His words are not reliable.

316
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:10,920
That's right.

317
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,080
Huo Pu Shui Zhen.

318
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,720
Huo Dai Rong is very smart.

319
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,880
It's hard to understand.

320
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,080
But at present,

321
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,720
he shouldn't have done anything to harm me.

322
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,920
And he also told me

323
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,720
some clues about his father's death.

324
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,320
What clues?

325
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,000
Since Miss Huo also thinks

326
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,600
General Huo's death is strange,

327
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,320
with Miss Huo's intelligence,

328
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,160
there will be no one who doubts it.

329
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,160
Mrs. Huo.

330
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,600
Mrs. Huo?

331
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,480
That's right.

332
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,320
Although my father is a tempered person,

333
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,200
he never hurt anyone.

334
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,720
But half a year ago,

335
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,960
my father suddenly became weird.

336
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,320
He was always violent.

337
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,320
He was a little impatient

338
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,960
and would hurt people.

339
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,920
My aunt's illness...

340
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,280
If my aunt was too sad,

341
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,280
it's better

342
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,440
to say that my father tortured her.

343
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,400
Then why do you suspect Mrs. Huo?

344
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,720
I asked the doctor.

345
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,720
If a person is wise and wise,

346
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,160
he will never be so cruel to his people.

347
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,560
So I suspect

348
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,240
my father was poisoned.

349
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,280
The food and medicine

350
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,280
my father ate

351
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,960
were all under Mrs. Huo's control.

352
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,520
She is the most suspicious.

353
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,600
But I just suspect

354
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,640
I have no evidence.

355
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,520
So I want to investigate it.

356
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,680
Huo Derong said

357
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,760
Mrs. Huo was married to General Huo five years ago.

358
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,000
She was 16 when she came to the mansion.

359
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,560
What about Mrs. Yuan Pei?

360
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,000
Mrs. Yuan Pei died five years ago.

361
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,200
She didn't leave any children.

362
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,720
I observed Mrs. Huo that day.

363
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,320
She was light-hearted

364
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,480
and didn't look like a noble lady.

365
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,960
Huo Derong also said

366
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,760
Mrs. Huo's father was a military man.

367
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,320
After Mrs. Huo got married,

368
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,960
the military man became the designated partner.

369
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,840
She exchanged her daughter's happiness

370
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,560
for the wealth of the family.

371
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,720
It's a good deal.

372
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,120
I don't know whether it's a deal or not.

373
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,120
But Mrs. Huo was not happy

374
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,200
after she got married.

375
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,520
She was depressed all the time.

376
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,360
She didn't go out and didn't talk to anyone.

377
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,120
Until three years ago, she got better.

378
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,560
She smiled a little more.

379
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,120
Three years ago?

380
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,800
Huo Derong has a deep resentment for Mrs. Huo.

381
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,760
We can't just listen to her.

382
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,960
We still have to find a way

383
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,040
to see Mrs. Huo.

384
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,360
Miss Huo is unpredictable.

385
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,640
You'd better not show up in the mansion again.

386
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,960
If it's really Mrs. Huo,

387
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,800
General Huo's death

388
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,440
has nothing to do with the night kill.

389
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,240
General Huo died in the middle of our investigation.

390
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,840
Maybe it's really a coincidence.

391
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,600
Anyway,

392
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,880
let's find out.

393
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,600
General Huo's death

394
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,880
was caused by the drug he had been taking for a long time.

395
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,240
So the murderer is locked in the mansion.

396
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,480
But there is one thing

397
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,720
I really don't understand.

398
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,240
It has nothing to do with the night kill Xiao Weiming.

399
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,400
That's right.

400
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,760
Maybe it has nothing to do with him.

401
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,760
Yan'er,

402
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,720
you and I have made a military order

403
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,160
in front of His Majesty.

404
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,160
We can't waste time for nothing.

405
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,680
But I feel

406
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,760
Xiao Weiming is right next to him.

407
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,840
Do you have any evidence?

408
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,680
Not yet.

409
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,120
But father,

410
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,320
please give me a few more days.

411
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,480
Maybe we can find the night kill

412
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,000
if we solve General Huo's case.

413
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,720
If we can't catch Xiao Weiming,

414
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,280
even if we solve a hundred cases,

415
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,360
we can't make up for it.

416
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,560
If His Majesty blames us,

417
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,560
we can't take the responsibility.

418
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,200
But now

419
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,040
we have more clues.

420
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,760
We shouldnever let our j pupils sit alone!

421
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,560
Why isn't anyone from Jiu部分 coming back?

422
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,320
Is something going on?

423
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,440
Nothing happens.

424
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,240
Peie Li said

425
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,980
People get together to see each other's sacrifices.

426
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,480
Interestingly,

427
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:25,420
in the pastOld Orchidville boxers

428
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,100
He asked someone and he was born a wafer.

429
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,760
He's also a great martial artist.

430
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,880
If there's a fight between him and I,

431
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,720
he'll just be a wolf.

432
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,400
Yes.

433
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,760
Don't be too anxious.

434
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,760
Don't be suspicious.

435
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,560
He's sneaky.

436
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,240
He's not doing anything good.

437
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,640
Let's go.

438
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,880
It's a secret place.

439
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:37,960
There are tall buildings

440
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,520
and a special guard at the door.

441
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,680
There must be something fishy.

442
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,160
According to the police report

443
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,680
I found in the capital city,

444
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,360
it's likely to be a black gambling house.

445
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,840
A black gambling house?

446
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,600
It's different from the gambling houses outside.

447
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,640
The gambling houses outside are under the supervision of the court.

448
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,880
People who gamble

449
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,880
will be registered.

450
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,440
But the black gambling house is not used.

451
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,600
Not only is it not under supervision,

452
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,720
the gambling house is also not small.

453
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,520
It seems that Xue Shan Shan is not only good at gambling,

454
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,760
but also plays well.

455
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,280
That's strange.

456
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,600
He's a disciple of the daily calendar.

457
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,520
How could he go to such a gambling house?

458
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,720
Where did he come from?

459
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,320
Someone is coming.

460
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,320
Come on.

461
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,920
Give me back my stuff.

462
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,400
Okay.

463
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,880
If you get another 500 taels,

464
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,520
I'll give it to you.

465
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,160
This business is a bit out of place.

466
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,000
What?

467
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,200
It's him.

468
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,360
Not only 500 taels.

469
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,160
You...

470
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,160
Let me have some fun.

471
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,120
I'll go with you.

472
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,120
Keep an eye on Xue Shan Shan.

473
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:14,800
I'll follow him.

474
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,840
We'll meet at the summit.

475
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,440
Be careful.

476
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,060
Zhao Mu Guan.

477
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,160
So handsome.

478
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,140
Zhao Mu Guan.

479
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,340
It doesn't matter.

480
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,280
Zhou Mushan.

481
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,880
This guy...

482
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:44,840
Zhou Mushan.

483
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,040
You'll find a way tospeaks.

484
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,360
Zhou Mushan is airport 실행.

485
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,260
Zhou Mushan.

486
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,800
Is he a big pick yet?

487
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,560
No.

488
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,840
Zhou Mushan set up a scheme.

489
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,780
Try to come to this.

490
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,680
Yes.

491
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,320
Zhou Mushan.

492
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,880
How about we come to this Party.

493
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,280
Really?

494
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,280
What are you doing here?

495
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,280
I'm asking you.

496
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,280
Are you following Xue Qian Shan?

497
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,280
I ran into Xue Qian Shan on my way to the mansion.

498
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,280
I remembered that she was not around today.

499
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,280
So I came to see what she was doing.

500
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,280
So it is.

501
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,280
Wait.

502
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,280
You went to the mansion alone.

503
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,280
You didn't call me.

504
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,280
You want to act alone again.

505
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,280
Isn't your stomach hurting?

506
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,280
No.

507
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,280
Do you want to go to the mansion too?

508
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,280
I want to go to the mansion alone.

509
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,280
I can't.

510
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,280
I can't.

511
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,280
Do you want to go to the mansion too?

512
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,280
You didn't call me.

513
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,280
I...

514
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,280
He is a man.

515
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,280
Why does he need to buy rouge?

516
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,280
You ask me.

517
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,280
You dress like this every day.

518
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,280
It smells like a coriander.

519
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,280
You should know it best.

520
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,280
Be serious when you fry it.

521
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,280
Let's go and have a look.

522
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,280
This is the powder.

523
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,280
Ten taels.

524
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,280
Just a small powder like this

525
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,280
costs ten taels of silver.

526
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,280
This powder is called West Stone Pond.

527
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,280
It is made of 100-year-old incense

528
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,280
and western red and blue.

529
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,280
It is extremely expensive.

530
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,280
Not to mention ten taels of silver.

531
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,280
When it comes to making money,

532
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,280
someone has to grab twenty taels of silver.

533
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,280
You don't even know this, do you?

534
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,280
How can I know this?

535
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,280
I don't need it.

536
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,280
But you are a big man.

537
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,280
You can't just take it.

538
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,280
You can't just take it.

539
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,280
You can't just take it.

540
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,280
You can't just take it.

541
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,280
You can't just take it.

542
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,280
But you are a big man.

543
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,280
You know a lot.

544
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,280
As a cashier,

545
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,280
you have to know a little bit about everything.

546
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,280
It seems that

547
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,280
you are not qualified

548
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,280
as a woman or a cashier.

549
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,280
The ten taels of silver

550
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,280
Mr. Zhuge spent

551
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,280
is not just to mock me, is it?

552
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,280
Of course it's for the investigation.

553
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,280
Xue Qianshan's rough and reckless husband

554
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,280
should not be free

555
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,280
from this kind of expensive powder.

556
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,280
That's right.

557
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,280
Smell it.

558
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,280
The smell of this powder is very special.

559
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,280
I think I've smelled this kind of smell

560
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,280
in someone in the household.

561
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,280
I've smelled it too.

562
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,280
When we were interrogating yesterday.

563
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,280
Are we talking about

564
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,280
the same person?

565
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,280
Let's go to the household.

566
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,280
Now?

567
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,280
The border is sacred.

568
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,280
Do you have anything else to do?

569
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,280
No.

570
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,280
I'm not in a hurry.

571
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,280
Do you feel

572
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,280
that you've changed a lot recently?

573
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,280
What?

574
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,280
Not like the old one.

575
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,280
You don't look so serious.

576
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,280
Especially the murderous spirit in your eyes.

577
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,280
You were so aggressive

578
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,280
until three years ago.

579
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,280
Time is so short.

580
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,280
The changes are so big.

581
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,280
I'm not in a hurry.

582
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,280
Not in a hurry?

583
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,280
Did you meet something happy?

584
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,280
And the person?

585
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,280
I've always been like this.

586
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,280
It's just that we have a deep communication.

587
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,280
You don't know me.

588
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,280
Really?

589
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,280
I don't want to talk to you.

590
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,280
I'm going to the household now.

591
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,280
You can come or not.

592
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,280
Mr. Zhu Ge.

593
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,280
You're late.

594
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,280
What's the matter?

595
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,280
Miss Huo.

596
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,280
We found the key clue

597
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,280
to General Huo's case.

598
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,280
I can only visit him at night.

599
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,280
Sorry to bother you.

600
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,280
I'm really sorry.

601
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,280
What's the new discovery?

602
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,280
You want to see me at night?

603
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,280
Miss Huo.

604
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,280
I'm sorry.

605
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,280
I'm sorry.

606
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,280
I'm sorry.

607
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,280
I'm sorry.

608
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,280
I'm sorry.

609
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,280
I'm sorry.

610
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,280
I'm sorry.

611
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,280
Miss Huo, do you recognize this?

612
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,280
This is the blood of the West Division.

613
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,280
This blood of the West Division

614
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,280
should be the one

615
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,280
Miss Huo uses every day.

616
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,280
I'm really using the blood of the West Division.

617
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,280
It's not you who bought it.

618
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,280
It's from someone else.

619
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,280
Do I need someone else

620
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,280
to give me some cosmetics?

621
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,280
I went to the butler

622
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,280
and checked Miss Huo's money.

623
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,280
I found that the household requires

624
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,280
extreme strictness

625
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,280
for food and clothing.

626
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,280
Especially for you.

627
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,280
Especially for you and Miss Huo's money.

628
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,280
I'm afraid it's hard to afford

629
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,280
these cosmetics.

630
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,280
Even if this blood of the West Division

631
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,280
is from someone else,

632
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,280
what's the point?

633
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,280
Today, we found that

634
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,280
Xue Qianshan's situation is suspicious.

635
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,280
After following up, we found that

636
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,280
she bought this blood of the West Division.

637
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,280
The blood of the West Division is expensive.

638
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,280
There are only a few bottles

639
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,280
in the whole capital for a month.

640
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,280
If it's an accident,

641
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,280
this blood of the West Division

642
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,280
was given to you by Xue Qianshan.

643
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,280
I don't know what the relationship

644
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,280
between you and your mother is.

645
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,280
Xue Qianshan gave me

646
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,280
this blood of the West Division.

647
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,280
But we have no relationship.

648
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,280
I can't

649
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,280
have anything to do with her.

650
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,280
She has been pestering me.

651
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,280
I just don't want to

652
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,280
get too close to her.

653
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,280
What's wrong with that?

654
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,280
Nothing wrong.

655
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,280
Since Xue Qianshan

656
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,280
has a clear intention to Miss Huo,

657
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,280
will Miss Huo

658
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,280
help us?

659
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,280
Help?

660
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,280
What help?

661
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:39,280
Bao relaxing

662
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,280
service

663
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,280
Thanks.

664
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,280
It's windy tonight.

665
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,680
I'll shut the windows.

666
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,280
Just for a take.

667
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,280
Let me go with you.

668
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:25,760
Bueno, follow me to the front

669
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,440
The assessments in the city

670
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,320
Wait for the three years

671
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,800
You can earn the money

672
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:34,840
Do not question me

673
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,400
Damn me

674
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,480
Tong Shuang

675
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,240
If

676
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,280
I mean, if

677
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,440
Because you made your fault

678
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,920
I got you and your people

679
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,760
That made them suffer

680
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,920
What would you do?

681
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,920
You're the only one I have.

682
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,760
We're like a chain of bones.

683
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,200
If I made a mistake and got you into trouble,

684
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,440
you wouldn't blame me, would you?

685
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,720
Of course not.

686
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,440
I...

687
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,200
If it were someone else,

688
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,680
even strangers,

689
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,440
If it were someone else,

690
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,320
you'd have to make it up to them.

691
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,320
Make it up?

692
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,640
Look.

693
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,960
If it were your house,

694
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,880
and you accidentally ordered a house for someone else,

695
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,160
you wouldn't have to watch others sleep on the street.

696
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,000
You'd have to make it up to them to get the house back.

697
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,680
You're so right.

698
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,680
Hurry up.

699
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,480
Don't cause trouble for the neighbors.

700
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,720
You've been through a lot.

701
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,920
You've been through a lot.

702
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,360
Brother, did I say something wrong again?

703
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,080
No.

704
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,040
You said it very well.

705
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,360
Thank you.

706
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,520
Rong Mei?

707
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,080
Why did you come to me?

708
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,920
I was so worried.

709
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,240
I was walking around.

710
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,600
I didn't expect to come to you.

711
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,480
It seems that you've been in trouble.

712
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,000
Tell me.

713
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,800
I'll help you solve it.

714
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,600
I'm sorry for what I've done.

715
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,960
I'm sorry for what I've done.

716
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,200
I'm sorry for what I've done.

717
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,200
I'm sorry for what I've done.

718
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,280
My father left suddenly.

719
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,400
He didn't help me look after others.

720
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,080
You know that

721
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,080
you can't tolerate me and my aunt.

722
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,440
My mother and I

723
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,440
don't know who to rely on in the future.

724
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,400
You're crying so easily.

725
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,840
Miss Huo is not easy.

726
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,640
Rong Mei, don't worry.

727
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,000
As long as I'm here,

728
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,360
I won't let you suffer.

729
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,960
Thank you for your kindness.

730
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,880
But the daily food and drink of our women's house

731
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,360
are always very expensive.

732
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,360
I know your thoughts.

733
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,920
I'm afraid that my mother and I

734
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,280
are also very worried.

735
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,360
Rong, why are you bothering Brother Xue?

736
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,120
Rong Mei, don't worry.

737
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,280
I've been lucky recently.

738
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,600
I found a way to make money.

739
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,480
I made a fortune today.

740
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,120
This number.

741
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,280
50 taels?

742
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,720
500 taels.

743
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,280
There will be more good things in the future.

744
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,200
I don't know where Brother Xue got the money from.

745
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,280
I'm afraid that the money he got from luck is not enough.

746
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,080
I have a treasure.

747
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,520
I can't rely on him to make money.

748
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,440
Treasure?

749
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,800
What treasure is so valuable?

750
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,520
This treasure is not valuable in itself.

751
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,960
But it can bring me a lot of money.

752
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,280
Rong Mei, as long as you are willing to follow me,

753
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:42,040
I can guarantee that you will live a life of endless glory.

754
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,520
Really?

755
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,080
I don't believe it.

756
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,160
Brother Xue, are you lying to me?

757
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,680
Rong Mei, you don't believe me?

758
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,400
I'll get the treasure for you right now.

759
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,680
I'll let you see.

760
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,880
Wait for me, Rong Mei.

761
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,920
He didn't tell you what the treasure is.

762
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,240
Where did he go?

763
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,480
He hasn't come back for so long.

764
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,480
He's killing me.

765
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,320
The Wind and the Five Sages?

766
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,240
Why are you here?

767
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,080
What happened just now?

768
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,680
What's wrong with you?

769
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,400
Wake up.

770
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,400
What's wrong with the knife in your hand?

771
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,400
Knife?

772
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,000
He's dead.

773
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,400
How did Xue Qian Shan die?

774
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,400
I didn't kill him.

775
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I don't know.

776
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,800
I didn't kill him.

777
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,400
I didn't kill him.

778
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:07,800
Stop him.

779
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,800
I didn't kill him.

780
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,800
Take the murderer away.

781
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,600
Wait.

782
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,800
We haven't figured it out yet.

783
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,800
What are you still investigating?

784
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,800
Are you going to see the whole family

785
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,200
of Huo's Mansion?

786
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,400
Mrs. Huo,

787
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,800
we don't want to see

788
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,200
another murder in Huo's Mansion.

789
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,200
I know Feng Wu Zuo.

790
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,400
He doesn't even kill a chicken.

791
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,600
How could he kill someone?

792
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,600
There's something wrong with this.

793
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,400
Give me some time to figure it out.

794
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,400
Don't arrest the wrong person.

795
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,600
Are you going to kill him?

796
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,600
Of course not.

797
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,600
I don't know.

798
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,200
But it won't be easy to convict.

799
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,800
There are still a lot of doubts

800
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,800
about this case.

801
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,800
The knife is in his hand.

802
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,200
He's also dead.

803
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,400
What are the doubts?

804
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,800
Is your case

805
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,800
just a mouth?

806
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Mr. Zhuge,

807
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,800
it's hard to say.

808
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,800
Actually, it's not complicated at all.

809
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,600
There are no big traces on the scene.

810
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,200
And Xue Qian Shan

811
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,600
was stabbed in the heart.

812
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,600
This means that he was

813
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,600
stabbed in the face

814
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,600
and killed.

815
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,600
Xue Qian Shan is very good at martial arts.

816
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,600
And the murderer can be killed with one stab.

817
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,200
Either the murderer

818
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,400
is a master of martial arts.

819
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,000
Or...

820
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Or the murderer

821
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,600
is someone very familiar with Xue Qian Shan.

822
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,200
He can sneak attack

823
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,200
without any guard.

824
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,200
Feng Wu Zuo is not familiar with Xue Qian Shan.

825
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,400
Do you think

826
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,000
he will sneak attack?

827
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Maybe

828
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,600
he's a master of martial arts.

829
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,000
What master of martial arts

830
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,200
doesn't run after killing people

831
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,400
and sit on the ground

832
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,200
and let you guys

833
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,000
catch him so easily?

834
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,600
Shut up.

835
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,800
I don't have the right to talk to you.

836
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,000
Miss Huo is right.

837
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,400
The most important thing is

838
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,400
Feng Wu Zuo has no reason to kill Xue Qian Shan.

839
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,400
Who knows?

840
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,600
Anyway,

841
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,800
we can't just let him go.

842
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,600
Feng Wu Zuo is a member of our Shen Buying.

843
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,800
Even if he is a suspect,

844
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,000
he has to be handed over to our Shen Buying.

845
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,800
He has fainted now.

846
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,600
Please let me take him back.

847
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
But you are a team.

848
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,000
Mrs. Huo,

849
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,200
please don't point at me.

850
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,600
I'll say it one last time.

851
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,600
Teach people.

852
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,600
Li,

853
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,400
I have a reminder for you.

854
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,800
The case is not cleared yet.

855
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
It's a serious crime to torture him privately.

856
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,400
Recently, there are enough things

857
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,400
in our Huo Mansion.

858
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,000
You...

859
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,400
Take him away.

860
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,600
Thank you.

861
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,000
We'll take Feng Wu Zuo back

862
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,200
to interrogate him

863
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,400
and give an explanation to the Huo Mansion.

864
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,600
But before we find out the truth,

865
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,000
please don't leave the Huo Mansion.

866
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,400
As for the body,

867
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,400
I'll keep it for now.

868
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,200
Thank you for your kind words.

869
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,000
It's nothing.

870
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,200
I didn't expect this to happen.

871
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,600
How are you going to deal with him?

872
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,600
According to the law.

873
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,600
Don't worry.

874
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,800
We'll figure it out.

875
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,800
Thank you, gentlemen.

876
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,200
I'll go back now.

877
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,400
Take Feng Wu Zuo back.

878
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,800
I'll go back and find someone to deal with the body.

879
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,400
You're not going to interrogate him?

880
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
It's not complicated.

881
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,200
There's nothing to interrogate.

882
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,800
And you said it.

883
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,400
The murderer is either a master

884
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,800
or a familiar person.

885
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,400
It's useless to interrogate him.

886
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,400
What did you find out?

887
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,200
I did a lot for your Feng Wu Zuo today.

888
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,400
I'm tired.

889
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,600
I'm going back to rest.

890
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,200
But you...

891
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:01,600
Don't worry.

892
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,400
I'll come back tomorrow morning.

893
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,600
The night is deep in the valley.

894
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,800
The mountain is dark and the clouds are dark.

895
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,800
The shadow is thin and the shadow is thin.

896
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:52,000
The night is silent but I want to...

897
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,800
The blood is so bitter.

898
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,000
The heart is so sad.

899
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
The flowers are blooming.

900
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,800
The wind is so strong.

901
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,200
The body is so heavy.

902
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,800
The body is so heavy.

903
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,600
Where can I go?

904
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,200
If I can't get my heart back,

905
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:14,200
I can't get my heart back.

906
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,400
I can't get my heart back.

907
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,000
Who can stop me?

908
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,200
If I can't get my heart back,

909
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,000
I can't get my heart back.

910
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,800
Look at the beautiful scenery.

911
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,200
The bright and bright sky.

912
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,000
The bright and bright sky.

913
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,600
The beautiful scenery.

914
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:02,400
I heard the sound of the flute in the boat.

915
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:09,200
Where can I go?

916
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,200
If I can't get my heart back,

917
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,800
I can't get my heart back.

918
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:21,200
I can't get my heart back.

919
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,800
Who can stop me?

920
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,000
If I can't get my heart back,

921
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,600
I can't get my heart back.

922
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,400
Look at the beautiful scenery.

923
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:36,000
The bright and bright sky.

924
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,200
The beautiful scenery.
