1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,020
Why is it you and I

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:06,020
who are waiting for him?

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,740
Really.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,220
I will follow this leaf

5
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,020
The first round of the competition is over.

6
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,020
The second round of the competition is over.

7
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,020
The third round of the competition is over.

8
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,020
The fourth round of the competition is over.

9
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,020
The fifth round of the competition is over.

10
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,020
The sixth round of the competition is over.

11
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,020
The seventh round of the competition is over.

12
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,020
The eighth round of the competition is over.

13
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,020
The ninth round of the competition is over.

14
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,020
The tenth round of the competition is over.

15
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,020
The tenth round of the competition is over.

16
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,020
The tenth round of the competition is over.

17
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,020
The tenth round of the competition is over.

18
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,020
The tenth round of the competition is over.

19
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,020
Find your state and come back.

20
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,020
Mai Dong, the monster is watching the top wind.

21
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,020
Master.

22
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,020
You are looking for revenge, right?

23
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,020
I'm not afraid of you.

24
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,020
Master.

25
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,020
You are looking for revenge, right?

26
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,020
Master.

27
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,020
Master.

28
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,020
Master.

29
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,020
Master.

30
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,020
Master.

31
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,020
Master.

32
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,020
Master.

33
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,020
Give it back to you.

34
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,020
Give it back to me.

35
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,020
You want me to find him and investigate with him?

36
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,020
Do you remember when I told you about the sea cliff accident?

37
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:12,020
In 1936.

38
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,020
Miao Jie once said that

39
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,020
Master was very afraid that the thing was just known by others.

40
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,020
If that thing refers to the sea cliff destruction,

41
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,020
then that year should be 1936.

42
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,020
Since Miao Jie said that,

43
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,020
it means that he is also an informant of this matter.

44
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,020
So we have to check the history books of Master and Miao Jie.

45
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,020
See where they are and what they are doing in that year.

46
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,020
There should be clues.

47
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,020
But all the official history books are in the Tianshu Pavilion.

48
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,020
Shen Buying has no right to enter the Tianshu Pavilion

49
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,020
and check the documents according to the law of the atmosphere.

50
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,020
That's why you asked me to find Zhuge Kongyuan.

51
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,020
But he is suspicious.

52
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,020
How could he help me?

53
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,020
Of course you need to use the bait.

54
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,020
Master, you haven't slept all night.

55
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,020
I have read the history books of these four masters

56
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,020
several times.

57
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,020
I really can't see any problem.

58
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,020
I can only see that these four masters

59
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,020
are willing to do anything for the country and the people.

60
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,020
I really don't understand

61
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,020
why Xiao Beiming

62
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,020
would do anything to these four masters.

63
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,020
Master, you are right.

64
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,020
I have to find out the truth.

65
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,020
I have to find out the truth.

66
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,020
Why did Xiao Beiming

67
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,020
do anything to these four masters?

68
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,020
Master, did we find the wrong direction?

69
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,020
No, we found the right direction.

70
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,020
Master, did you see anything

71
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,020
in the history books?

72
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,020
A momentary place.

73
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,020
The problem is in the moment.

74
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,020
In 1936,

75
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,020
the late emperor passed away.

76
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,020
When the emperor ascended the throne,

77
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,020
the late emperor was seriously ill

78
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,020
and he had no power to go to court.

79
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,020
So he took away

80
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,020
some officials who were not in charge

81
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,020
to help the late emperor deal with the affairs.

82
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,020
The store that the masters were in charge of

83
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,020
became the history books.

84
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,020
In 1936?

85
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,020
This year is the 22nd year of the news.

86
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,020
Even if the four masters

87
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,020
have worked together in the history books,

88
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,020
it has been more than 20 years.

89
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,020
Is this why Xiao Beiming killed them?

90
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,020
Xiao Beiming was still in his prime.

91
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,020
What about the other four masters?

92
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,940
Except for the statue of the

93
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,020
sad man,

94
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,020
we can only find

95
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,020
the only management of these four masters.

96
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,020
The momentary place is indeed not the reason for the murder.

97
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,020
So I'm wondering

98
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,020
if these four masters

99
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,020
have done anything together

100
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,020
and left any trouble.

101
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,020
But nothing is recorded in these documents.

102
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,020
That's because it's not recorded.

103
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,020
That's why it's more suspicious.

104
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,020
What on earth

105
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,020
happened in 1936?

106
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,020
Sir, someone is asking for an audience.

107
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,020
Who?

108
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,020
The candidates of Shenmu Camp.

109
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,020
Since I was a child,

110
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,020
the Central Committee has never taken the initiative to look for me.

111
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,020
This time,

112
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,020
is there something important?

113
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,020
Didn't you always want to cooperate with me?

114
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,020
Have you figured it out?

115
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,020
I have.

116
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,020
Why did you change your mind all of a sudden?

117
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,020
Is Mr. Shen dead?

118
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,020
I'm not surprised that you know.

119
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,020
Seven masters died three years ago.

120
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,020
One of them is my father.

121
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,020
Not long ago,

122
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,020
seven of them died in Fengshan.

123
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,020
In addition to Mr. Shen,

124
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,020
a total of 15 people were killed by night.

125
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,020
Compared with these people,

126
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,020
the conflict between Shenmu Camp and the secret camp

127
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,020
is nothing.

128
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,020
As long as the night can be over,

129
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,020
everyone can be released one day earlier.

130
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,020
I hate the night,

131
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,020
but it's not that I don't know.

132
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,020
It's really admirable

133
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,020
that the Central Committee can think like this.

134
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,020
So you agreed?

135
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,020
Mr. Shen died tragically.

136
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,020
His Majesty was furious.

137
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,020
The night was killed in a month

138
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,020
in the secret camp.

139
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,020
I can't ask for help

140
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,020
because of you.

141
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,020
But now all my clues are broken.

142
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,020
I have no clue.

143
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,020
I have a clue.

144
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,020
Tell me.

145
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,020
Tell you?

146
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,020
First, you have to promise me to investigate the case with you.

147
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,020
It depends on whether this clue is useful.

148
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,020
If it's useless...

149
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,020
Zhuge Kongyun,

150
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,020
if it wasn't for catching the night,

151
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,020
I would never come to see you.

152
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,020
Now I have already committed Shenmu Camp's great deed.

153
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,020
But you are still playing tricks on me.

154
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,020
Since you don't believe me,

155
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,020
then let's say goodbye here.

156
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,020
Wait.

157
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,020
Light the fire and it's over.

158
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,020
What does Chang'an need?

159
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,020
Calm down.

160
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,020
You are a stupid person.

161
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,020
Okay.

162
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,020
I promise you.

163
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,020
But I have a condition too.

164
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,020
Tell me.

165
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,020
If I catch Ye Sha and Xiao Bei Ming,

166
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,020
you can't be executed privately.

167
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,020
You have to be punished according to the camp.

168
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,020
What do you think?

169
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,020
Okay.

170
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,020
You can't win if you are not calm.

171
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,020
You can't win if you are not calm.

172
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,020
You can't win if you are not calm.

173
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,020
You should listen to others.

174
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,020
You can't win if you are not calm.

175
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,020
You can't win if you are not calm.

176
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,180
It's because of Shen Bi,

177
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,020
you,

178
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,020
Shen Bi.

179
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,020
Shen Bi died because of me.

180
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,020
Shen Bi died because of me.

181
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,020
I have no clue.

182
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,020
So

183
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,020
you took a risky move

184
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,020
and told Xue Man to go to Zhuge Kongyun.

185
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,020
and told Xue Man to go to Zhuge Kongyun.

186
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,020
The public interest is the phone.

187
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,300
is also a living thing.

188
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,660
But the other Kongyuns

189
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,820
won't be willing to be your pawns.

190
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,380
If you make a mistake,

191
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,060
he'll jump out of the chessboard.

192
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,060
By then,

193
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,980
you won't be able to win.

194
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,300
Luo Ze.

195
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,140
Master.

196
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,340
I'm afraid

197
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,680
you might see

198
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,060
little remorse.

199
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,940
I didn't expect

200
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,420
Xiao Beining to come back

201
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,220
and study sell the tamas.

202
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:05,420
Only to see

203
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,340
one laugh again.

204
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,380
Master,

205
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:19,240
is the ocean

206
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,020
related to you?

207
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,780
I don't know.

208
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,180
I just heard a few words.

209
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,660
Which words?

210
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,340
Ningtai Thirty-six Years.

211
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,580
What does it mean?

212
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,580
Ningtai Thirty-six Years.

213
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,380
I don't know what it means

214
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,540
before I was born.

215
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,980
But they are arguing.

216
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,900
There must be something wrong

217
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,980
with mentioning this year.

218
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,300
I'm thinking

219
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,740
what happened this year

220
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,260
and whether it has anything to do

221
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,300
with the death of my father.

222
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,180
Ningtai Thirty-six Years.

223
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,380
Where did Lord Zhongbo get the job?

224
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,020
My father said before

225
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,940
he was a soldier before he entered the interrogation camp.

226
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,140
But I don't know

227
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:02,980
which army he got the job in.

228
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,540
So I came to you

229
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,420
to check my father's resume.

230
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:19,980
My lords,

231
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,460
here are the documents you asked for.

232
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:23,900
Please.

233
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,060
How could this happen?

234
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,420
My lords,

235
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,500
do you need my help

236
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,660
with any questions?

237
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,180
How could this document

238
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,140
be touched by someone?

239
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,060
Well...

240
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,860
My lords, you are so wise.

241
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,460
I... I dare not say that.

242
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,660
Look at it yourself.

243
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,140
Lord Zhongbo's Ningtai Thirty-six Years

244
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,580
and all the previous resume

245
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,540
were torn off.

246
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,260
Well...

247
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,420
Well...

248
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,780
I don't know

249
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,780
what's going on.

250
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,700
Officials of the same rank as Lord Zhongbo

251
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,980
only get the papers

252
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,540
after the imperial court and the cabinet

253
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,820
personally check their documents every year.

254
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,540
Not to mention being torn off,

255
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,620
even if they are transferred,

256
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,580
they need your permission.

257
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,140
What's going on with you?

258
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,700
Unless

259
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,980
the money has been torn off.

260
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,860
What nonsense are you talking about?

261
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:29,940
I dare not.

262
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,220
Please forgive me.

263
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,380
Leave us.

264
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:35,980
Yes.

265
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,180
Does he mean

266
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,140
His Majesty...

267
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,300
What should we do now?

268
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,980
Although Lord Zhongbo's resume

269
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,860
has been torn off,

270
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,860
after Ningtai Thirty-six Years,

271
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,100
he did transfer from the Ministry of War to the Ministry of Justice.

272
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,220
Then we'll check the documents of the Ministry of War.

273
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,180
Since Lord Zhongbo was once in,

274
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,140
there must be a partner to be searched.

275
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,220
Let's see which generals

276
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,220
have fought with Lord Zhongbo

277
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,660
in Ningtai Thirty-six Years.

278
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:43,020
八阿鼠

279
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,180
Brother.

280
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,980
Brother, we've been waiting for so long.

281
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,500
Zhong Bu Hui hasn't come back yet.

282
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,300
Is something wrong?

283
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,940
That woman can't even hurt him.

284
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,340
You think Brother Zhu Kong Ying is like you?

285
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,940
You know how to fight all day.

286
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,780
What's there to be afraid of?

287
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,340
Brother, the tofu I just bought is still hot.

288
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,460
I'm not hungry.

289
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,700
You cook it for Feng Xin.

290
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,940
As long as you're overalled with surprise.

291
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,700
Don't you want to taste it?

292
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,500
It's so hot.

293
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,820
Xiao Bei Ming,

294
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,540
how much more does it matter for you

295
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,420
to refuse Xiang Xun to give you a portter's gold chain?

296
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,140
Tell me,

297
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,180
how much time do you have left?

298
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,340
OK.

299
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,380
Just take one.

300
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,180
You'll go empty-handed,

301
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,860
and then give me the opportunity again.

302
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,020
I'm sorry.

303
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:51,980
Speaking of business,

304
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,300
have you found anything?

305
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,500
Miao Jie and Huo Zong Yao?

306
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,540
They are the same as Lord Zhong Bo.

307
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,300
The Lv Li who was in Ning Tai

308
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,500
was killed 36 years ago.

309
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:09,820
It seems that

310
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,300
someone really doesn't want us

311
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,460
to find out what happened back then.

312
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,380
Lord Liao was killed

313
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,980
in Feng Bo Lake three years ago.

314
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,940
Now he's only called General Huo.

315
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,540
He was dismissed from the Ministry of War last year.

316
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,180
Now he's retired.

317
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,500
Let's go find him.

318
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,060
General Zhong Bo,

319
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:28,980
I remember that three years ago,

320
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,620
when you and Xiao Bei Ming got married,

321
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,100
General Huo came here.

322
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,460
How is he usually related to your father?

323
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,100
I've seen General Huo a few times.

324
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,180
It's just a normal relationship.

325
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,540
We don't have any private relationships.

326
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,980
We don't have any meetings.

327
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,620
I don't know the Huo family at all.

328
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,580
That's strange.

329
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,180
General Huo and Lord Zhong Bo were in the army.

330
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,420
It should be a good relationship.

331
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,780
It's not as familiar as you remember.

332
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,340
I'm sure I remember it right.

333
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,660
The front door is almost there.

334
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:07,260
Go ask the

335
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,300
General Huo.

336
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,740
Who are you looking for?

337
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:23,020
I'm here to visit General Huo Zong Yao.

338
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,300
You shouldn't have come.

339
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,500
My father passed away last night.

340
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,260
General Huo is dead?

341
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,140
Yes.

342
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,140
Why is he dead again?

343
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,180
What's the cause of death?

344
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,100
The Huo family said that he died of an emergency.

345
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,380
General Huo is powerful.

346
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,820
At this time, Zhuge Kongyun can't enter the mansion.

347
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,540
He can only wait until the funeral is over.

348
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,340
We found out that Lord Shen died.

349
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,580
We found out that General Huo died.

350
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,860
General Huo is dead too.

351
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,180
This is definitely not a coincidence.

352
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,620
You suspect the people from the Night Fiends did it?

353
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,860
We have to check it out.

354
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,740
I'm going to the Huo family.

355
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,660
Brother, no.

356
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,940
You're a wanted criminal now.

357
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,500
Yes, it's too dangerous.

358
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,060
An Zhenying knows you're not dead.

359
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,140
The investigation is very practical.

360
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,900
Many key evidence is in order.

361
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,980
If I can be there when Lord Shen dies,

362
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,980
then I can find out the cause of his death as soon as possible.

363
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,100
Then the murderer who poisoned him may not be able to escape.

364
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,460
General Huo died last night.

365
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,460
There's still time.

366
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,820
But if the funeral is over,

367
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,340
it may be too late.

368
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:15,900
Sister.

369
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,060
Lord Shen's order.

370
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,940
We can't repeat it.

371
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,700
I got it.

372
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,940
I'll figure it out.

373
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,780
What's this?

374
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,540
The moon is coming down.

375
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,780
Are you afraid that others can't see us?

376
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,260
You're a scoundrel.

377
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,020
General Huo is in the forest.

378
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,340
Many people will come to

379
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,020
display the corpse's body.

380
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,980
The Huo family needs a lantern.

381
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,020
Someone has to watch the lanterns all night.

382
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:47,780
Look.

383
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:52,020
The people who light the lanterns are all dressed like this.

384
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,980
This is called dressing up as a night guard.

385
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:54,420
Wait.

386
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,540
What does the baton moon mean?

387
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,300
Batons are the same.

388
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,500
Four bats are surrounded by the moon

389
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,540
like a coin.

390
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,540
The dead are loyal.

391
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,220
So they have to guard the moon.

392
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,700
The night guard

393
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,820
is a noble guest

394
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,620
except for the family and the descendants.

395
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,140
So the guests won't ask too much.

396
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,980
Good.

397
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,100
You're not tall.

398
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,100
You know a lot.

399
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,500
Let's check General Huo's body first.

400
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,140
Be careful.

401
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,620
If I'm found out,

402
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,620
you can escape.

403
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,340
I'm a man.

404
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,460
You're the best.

405
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,540
Okay.

406
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,220
Let's go together.

407
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,340
Everyone, be smart.

408
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,260
Act quickly.

409
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,620
Especially you, Dong Shuang.

410
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,700
Don't be impulsive.

411
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,580
Don't worry, brother.

412
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,940
I'm trying.

413
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,660
I'm leaving.

414
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,140
Do you hear me?

415
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,180
Don't be impulsive.

416
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:38,700
Be smart.

417
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,820
You be smart.

418
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,220
General Huo

419
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,220
instances of sons barrels of poison

420
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,480
Verified

421
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,340
both their bodies and their blood

422
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:17,620
have a chocolate

423
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,860
I heard General Huo

424
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,980
Those in the front hall are probably the scum.

425
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,420
We must not provoke them.

426
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,860
The warehouse is too big.

427
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,220
The study, the bedroom,

428
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,100
and the place where General Huo often goes in

429
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,740
may all have important clues.

430
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,140
Now that the people in the warehouse are scattered,

431
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,900
it's the best time to get in.

432
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,140
Let's split up.

433
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,100
Chong Shuang, let's go to General Huo's yard.

434
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,900
Shi Mei, you take Feng Jingzhu to the backyard.

435
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,580
We'll meet here in half an hour.

436
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,180
Be careful.

437
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,860
Go to the other side.

438
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,700
What about you?

439
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,640
I'll go to the

440
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,580
I think we'd better not separate.

441
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,100
Are you afraid?

442
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,540
Who's afraid?

443
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,580
Please don't kill me.

444
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,460
You're not here to guard the night.

445
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,940
Who are you?

446
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,420
Tell me.

447
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,100
What are you doing in my house?

448
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,780
You're a girl.

449
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,940
I don't want to hurt you.

450
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,340
Be honest.

451
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,660
Don't yell.

452
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,620
You're a girl too.

453
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,060
I don't want to hurt you.

454
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,460
I don't want to hurt you.

455
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,660
I don't want to hurt you.

456
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,060
I don't want to hurt you.

457
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,460
I don't want to hurt you.

458
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,020
You're a girl too.

459
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,780
You're a girl.

460
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,700
Why bother a girl?

461
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,340
Look at you.

462
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,580
I guess you're not here to steal.

463
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,620
This is the training ground.

464
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,740
There are weapons and armors everywhere.

465
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,940
There are no expensive items.

466
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,860
No matter how stupid the thief is,

467
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,700
he won't come here to steal.

468
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,700
I found you.

469
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,740
You didn't run away or kill anyone.

470
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,580
It means you haven't done

471
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,700
what you want to do.

472
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,180
Are you here to investigate

473
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,660
what's going on

474
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,020
with General Huo's death?

475
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,980
You're wearing the school uniform.

476
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,100
Who are you to General Huo?

477
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,940
To be honest,

478
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,020
my name is Huo Dai Rong.

479
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,780
I'm the daughter of Huo Zong Yao.

480
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,660
You suspect that Huo Zong Yao's death

481
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,780
is related to the night killing of Xiao Bei Ming?

482
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,980
Do you have any evidence?

483
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,980
Do you have any evidence to prove it?

484
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,260
It's a direct conclusion.

485
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,380
If the case is based on a direct conclusion,

486
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,060
why do you need to be legal?

487
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,460
Don't say that in front of me again.

488
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,100
Father.

489
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:22,740
All right.

490
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,740
If Huo Zong Yao's death is really problematic,

491
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,180
the Huo family will report it.

492
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,300
You're too obsessed with Xiao Bei Ming

493
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,380
and you don't know what's going on.

494
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,820
But time is limited.

495
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,020
Any one of them

496
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,220
could be the key to the night killing.

497
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,180
If the murder of the capital

498
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,820
is related to the night killing,

499
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,300
even the three of us

500
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,700
in the secret police can't find it out.

501
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,740
If you try your best,

502
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,220
you'll be killed by Xiao Bei Ming.

503
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,900
Calm down and think about it.

504
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,580
I'll go.

505
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,740
She's General Huo's daughter.

506
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,100
She wasn't in the temple at that time,

507
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,620
but she appeared at the training ground.

508
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,300
She didn't light the lantern and was wearing a weapon.

509
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,580
No matter how you look at Miss Huo,

510
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,620
it seems like she's doing something dangerous.

511
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,540
It seems that you're not an ordinary woman.

512
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:15,940
That's right.

513
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,300
Father suddenly passed away.

514
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,060
There are many doubts.

515
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,300
I came here

516
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,020
to find out the cause of father's death.

517
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,140
Don't be afraid.

518
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,900
As long as you stay quiet,

519
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,300
I won't hurt you.

520
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,020
You're Zhong Xue Man?

521
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:58,900
You don't

522
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,340
wear dress,

523
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,460
but the boots on your feet are ens neighbors.

524
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,580
The whole Baby Hearth

525
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:13,220
has few women who can wear Albania feet.

526
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,620
Those who know nothing can earn less蹤아

527
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,300
If I guess it right,

528
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,020
would I have been fans

529
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,220
In other words,

530
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,420
the weapon in your hand

531
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,020
is the secret weapon in the legend.

532
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,660
Don't think too much.

533
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,900
I'm usually interested in

534
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,260
the theory of the sandstorm.

535
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,940
I just know more than others.

536
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,620
I've heard a lot of stories about the Shadow Division.

537
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,500
Looking at you now,

538
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,980
I guess you're right.

539
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,700
Since we have the same goal,

540
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,220
why don't we work together?

541
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,660
You don't even know what my purpose is.

542
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,820
You're willing to believe me?

543
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,380
Compared to believing you,

544
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,300
I'm more untrustworthy

545
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,900
in the whole Huo Mansion.

546
00:25:59,140 --> 00:25:59,980
Besides,

547
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,340
I also want to see

548
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,980
if the legendary Zhong Xue Man

549
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,660
is really that powerful.

550
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,020
If my father has a secret,

551
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,700
he'll definitely hide it in the bedroom.

552
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,100
If I need to investigate,

553
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,220
I can lead the way.

554
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,980
De типа

555
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:47,140
Wei's

556
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,140
What's your plan?

557
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,340
I...

558
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:50,860
I'll go find her.

559
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,500
Help!

560
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,580
Let's go.

561
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,140
Let's go.

562
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,540
Madam, are you hurt?

563
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,580
I was just packing up my master's belongings.

564
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,140
He suddenly broke in

565
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,100
and tried to invade me.

566
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,220
How dare you!

567
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,740
How dare you break into the mansion at night!

568
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,900
Packing up your belongings?

569
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,220
Then why are you lying on the bed?

570
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:28,700
You...

571
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,420
It's a woman!

572
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,820
Brother, I'll help her.

573
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,300
No need.

574
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:39,900
Brother,

575
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,420
we can't just go and get the money, right?

576
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,620
Dong Shuang, you go...

577
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,340
Who are you?

578
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,780
What do you want to do in the mansion?

579
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,580
The Guards of the Divine Cloth Store are slow.

580
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,580
I'm here to investigate.

581
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:56,940
Smart.

582
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,180
Let's go.

583
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:00,620
Let's go.

584
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,340
You said you were from the Guards of the Divine Cloth Store.

585
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,660
Do you have any evidence?

586
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,620
Of course.

587
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,100
You're really a bad guy.

588
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:10,940
Hai Ran!

589
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:11,900
You...

590
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:14,980
Stop!

591
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,380
There is a female agent in the Guards of the Divine Cloth Store.

592
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,780
She is the daughter of Lord Zhong Bu, Zhong Xue Man.

593
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,180
They are the same as Lord Zhong Bu.

594
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,020
The record of the 36 years of Ning Tai

595
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:37,980
has been lost.

596
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,660
Someone really doesn't want us to find out

597
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,620
what happened that year.

598
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,980
Lord Liao met with your father

599
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,460
in the Wind Waves Lake three years ago.

600
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,660
Now, he only has the right to live.

601
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:50,860
What happened in the 36 years of Ning Tai?

602
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:51,980
Li Long.

603
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,060
Young Master.

604
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,300
Prepare the horse.

605
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,180
It's so late.

606
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,220
Where are you going?

607
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,580
Bad news!

608
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:01,700
Bad news!

609
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,020
Speak.

610
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,740
Someone stole Lord's body.

611
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,340
Where are the guards?

612
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,700
They just ran here.

613
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,580
Oh no.

614
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,860
It's a chance to distract the tiger from the mountain.

615
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,580
They have accomplices.

616
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,620
Tie them up.

617
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,140
When I catch your accomplices,

618
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,140
interrogate them together.

619
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,060
Hurry up and get Lord's body back.

620
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:19,860
Chase them!

621
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:30,860
No.

622
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,380
This is the good way you said.

623
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,660
The identity of the Junior Guards of the Divine Cloth Store

624
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,780
plus the daughter of Lord Zhong Bu,

625
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,220
the Huo family won't do anything to her.

626
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,900
As long as the body of Huo Zeng Yao is in our hands,

627
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,220
we can get her back.

628
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,300
Why do we have to change the body?

629
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,780
Because there must be something wrong with this body.

630
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,940
You and this one go prepare the horse.

631
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,460
Yes.

632
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:52,940
Yes.

633
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,460
Stop.

634
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,740
Go and see what's going on.

635
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,500
Yes.

636
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:05,820
Stop.

637
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,460
Stop.

638
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,220
Stop.

639
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:08,780
Stop.

640
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,820
Chase them quickly.

641
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:11,980
Where are we going now?

642
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,020
Bai Shui He and Yi Zhuang.

643
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,220
They're coming after us.

644
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:14,700
What should we do?

645
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,820
Is there a way to stop them?

646
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,300
Stop.

647
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,300
Stop.

648
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,220
Stop.

649
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:25,780
Stop.

650
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,300
Be steady.

651
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,660
Stop.

652
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:30,940
Stop.

653
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,220
Stop.

654
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,100
Did you see him?

655
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,900
I don't know where he is picking a fight now.

656
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,100
Hurry.

657
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:55,900
Kill him.

658
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,640
I don't have time for this.

659
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,160
I'll go with you.

660
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,200
Let's go.

661
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,440
What are you doing?

662
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,800
I'll go with you.

663
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,200
I'll go with you.

664
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,400
Go.

665
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,200
Go.

666
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,200
Go.

667
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,200
Go.

668
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,200
Go.

669
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,200
Go.

670
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,200
Go.

671
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,200
Go.

672
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,200
Go.

673
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,200
Go.

674
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,200
Go.

675
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,200
Go.

676
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,200
Go.

677
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,200
Go.

678
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,200
Go.

679
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,200
Go.

680
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,200
Go.

681
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,200
Go.

682
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,200
Go.

683
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,200
Go.

684
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,200
Go.

685
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,260
What will we do?

686
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,500
Isn't there any other idea?

687
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,980
This is the only way.

688
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,140
However,

689
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:35,820
Who...

690
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,180
How about this,

691
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:22,920
your

692
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,920
Yes, sir.

693
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,120
Hurry up.

694
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,120
Hurry up.

695
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,120
Hurry up.

696
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,120
Hurry up.

697
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,120
Fu Ying Zhuo,

698
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,520
do you still have poison?

699
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,720
Yes, in my box.

700
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,920
You can light it with the spark.

701
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,120
Why is it different from before?

702
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,120
The poison is used up.

703
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,320
It's from Qu Wen.

704
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,120
It's enough to scare them.

705
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,120
There's poison in it.

706
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,720
What are you waiting for?

707
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,720
Go get the master's will back.

708
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,920
Someone will use poison in it.

709
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,520
Listen to me.

710
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,920
Give me my master's will back.

711
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,120
I'll spare your lives.

712
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,920
Tian Hua,

713
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,320
get the people inside out.

714
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,120
Yes, sir.

715
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,120
Don't touch them.

716
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,120
There are people inside.

717
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,520
I don't care who they are.

718
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,920
What if they are hurt by my master's will?

719
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,920
Kill them.

720
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,920
Yes, sir.

721
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,520
What's going on outside?

722
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,920
They're going to set fire.

723
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,720
Are you afraid?

724
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,920
I'm a coroner.

725
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,720
Before the autopsy is complete,

726
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,120
I won't stop even if the knife is stuck on my neck.

727
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,720
General Huo's body is still inside.

728
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,120
Do you want to burn General Huo's body too?

729
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,920
I'll give you one last chance

730
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,520
to hand over my master's body.

731
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,520
Enough.

732
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,320
Stop talking nonsense.

733
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,920
Who is being impudent here?

734
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,920
You're finally here.

735
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,520
I just fixed my clothes.

736
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,520
And I lost weight.

737
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,320
Do you know that

738
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,120
it's a serious crime to set fire in my country?

739
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,120
Chief Fang,

740
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,320
the people from the interrogation camp

741
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,920
stole my master's body.

742
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,120
How should I settle this crime?

743
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,320
Who are you?

744
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,720
Greetings, Chief Fang.

745
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,520
I'm Yi Xiao, a disciple of the Naihuo Sect.

746
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,520
This is my senior brother,

747
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,920
Xue Qianshan.

748
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,320
I'm General Huo's wife.

749
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,920
Greetings, Chief Fang.

750
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,520
The Huo family was a bit reckless just now.

751
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,120
I apologize for them.

752
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:12,120
But your loyal subordinates broke into the Huo Mansion last night.

753
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:15,520
Two other people stole our general's body.

754
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,720
What we did just now

755
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,320
was really forced.

756
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,920
Such a big case.

757
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,120
Shouldn't the interrogation camp

758
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,920
give an explanation to the Huo family?

759
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,120
Chief Zhong,

760
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,320
they're telling the truth.

761
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,320
Come here and talk to me.

762
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,520
I said come down.

763
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,920
Who's in there?

764
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,320
Hurry up and hand over General Huo's body.

765
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,920
Impossible.

766
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,120
It's unreasonable.

767
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,720
His tongue is black and blood is coming out of his eyes.

768
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,920
This is a feature of death.

769
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,720
But his skin is smooth and his color is normal.

770
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,720
No scratches.

771
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,720
No signs of external force.

772
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,720
No injuries or poisoning.

773
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,120
No broken bones.

774
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,320
Impossible.

775
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,720
I suspect General Huo's death

776
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,120
is related to the case of Night Fiend.

777
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,120
What are you talking about?

778
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,120
The reason why you brought General Huo's body here

779
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,320
is to find out the truth.

780
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,920
According to the law of Qi,

781
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:27,120
all the officers and officers above the five-ranked

782
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,320
are killed.

783
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,720
Whether the case is reported or not,

784
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,120
the Ministry of Justice has the right to investigate.

785
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,120
Since General Huo's death

786
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,720
involves the evidence of the Night Fiend case,

787
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,920
then what Zhong Bu Kui did today

788
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,920
is to investigate the case according to the law.

789
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,320
That was before.

790
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,520
Chief Fang,

791
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,520
now the big case in the capital

792
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,120
is under the charge of Night Fiend.

793
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,120
Even if we want to investigate,

794
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,520
we have to do it.

795
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,520
What is your Shen Buying?

796
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,120
What did you say?

797
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,320
What did you say?

798
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,920
What did you say?

799
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,120
If I'm not wrong,

800
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:04,520
please give my master's body to the Shen Buying

801
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,920
and make a charge for Zhong Xue Man.

802
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,920
Yes, that's right.

803
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,520
Who is looking for Night Fiend?

804
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,320
Since only Night Fiend can investigate,

805
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,320
then I'll follow your order.

806
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,720
It's really Zhong Bu Kui.

807
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,320
He found out the suspiciousness of General Huo's case so quickly.

808
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,320
It really makes me surprised and happy.

809
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,920
Brother Zhu is in a coma.

810
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,120
If the police find you,

811
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,920
it'll be a big trouble.

812
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,720
What do you mean?

813
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,120
That's right.

814
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,120
That's right.

815
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,920
I found out that

816
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,920
General Huo's death may be suspicious.

817
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,320
But due to the funeral of the Huo family,

818
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,120
I asked Zhong Bu Kui

819
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,520
to help me secretly investigate General Huo's body

820
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,120
and make such a big trouble.

821
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,520
It's my bad plan.

822
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,120
I apologize to all of you in the Huo family.

823
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,320
The Dark True Camp will cooperate with Shen Buying?

824
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:22,520
Do I need you to teach me how to work in the Dark True Camp?

825
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,120
That's right.

826
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,920
The Dark True Camp and Shen Buying

827
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,320
are in the same department.

828
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,520
They usually work together in the capital.

829
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,320
Now, when they encounter a case,

830
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,920
they should serve each other.

831
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,920
Don't you let go of the rope?

832
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,320
I'm sorry.

833
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,320
I'm sorry.

834
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,320
I think the autopsy is almost over.

835
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,320
Zhong Bu Kui,

836
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,120
let the people in it open the door.

837
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,320
I'll help you solve it.

838
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,320
Yes.

839
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,320
Zhong Bu Kui, please.

840
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,520
I'll help you solve it.

841
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,520
