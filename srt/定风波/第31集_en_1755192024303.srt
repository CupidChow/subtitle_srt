155
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,940

156
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,270

157
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,660

158

159

Let him see what you've become.

160
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,720

161
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,130

162
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,440

but all we found in the rubble

167
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,720
was this.

168

00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,370
I'll bring you

193
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,050
pastries from Phoenix Market

194
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,120
and wine from Huangni Village.

195
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,600
I'll keep every promise

196
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,060
I made to you.

197
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,840
As for the tofu maker's daughter,

198
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,240
stop thinking about her.

199
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,170
With your hot temper,

200
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,960
you'd probably scare her off.

201
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,320
Tong Shuang,

202
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,150
just watch.

203
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,870
Watch Beiming

204
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,510
catch Yesha with us.

205
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:18,690
[Here lies Tong Shuang,
Xiao Beiming's brother]

206
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,070
We will catch him,

207
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,600
avenge you and your family,

208
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,930
and then bring you home.

209
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,150
Trust me.

210
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,550
It won't be long.

211
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,200
We'll be back soon.

212
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:50,720
Let's go.

213
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:14,960
[Here lies Tong Shuang,
Xiao Beiming's brother]

214
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,750
Are you saying

215
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,240
my brother and the others were poisoned

216
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,270
because of the water?

217
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,070
That's right.

218
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,130
They drank water from Lonely Town.

219
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,750
What's wrong with the water?

220
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,950
So many people died

221
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:35,790
in Lonely Town back then.

222
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,080
There must have been a lot of corpses,

223
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,020
but inside the town,

224
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,550
we didn't see many remains.

225
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,630
So I think

226
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,670
the Canfeng Army

227
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,360
must have burned

228
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,360
all those bodies.

229
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,120
What about the burned remains?

230
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,790
They were dumped into that lake.

231
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,960
It's stagnant water,

232
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,150
and over the years,

233
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,150
the pill toxin spread
throughout the entire lake.

234
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:51,870
I guess

235
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,200
your brother and his group

236
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,220
came into contact with it

237
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,480
while gathering supplies

238
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,720
in the town,

239
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,080
and that's how they got poisoned.

240
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,080
After they returned,

241
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,000
the poison gradually took effect.

242
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,400
So that's what happened.

243
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:04,750
As for those wild beasts,

244
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,320
they probably drank from the lake too

245
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,790
while foraging in the town.

246
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,240
After generations,

247
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,050
they've turned into

248
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,790
the crazed beasts we see now.

249
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,360
I-Is there a cure for this poison?

250
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,000
Although we don't have a cure now,

251
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,920
we've obtained

252
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:26,910
the Swift Wind Pill's formula.

253
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,240
We have the best physician with us.

254
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,070
He'll definitely

255
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,200
create an antidote.

256
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,080
But before then,

257
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,840
if you must go to Lonely Town,

258
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,790
don't touch the lake water.

259
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,960
I understand.

260
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,910
The danger isn't over yet.

261
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:40,960
Are you sure

262
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,220
you won't come with us?

263
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,000
Mr. Xiao,

264
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,270
we're grateful for everything

265
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,000
you and your friends have done,

266
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,150
but the journey ahead is too dangerous.

267
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:51,870
We'd only

268
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,000
slow you down.

269
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,910
Most importantly,

270
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,360
no matter what,

271
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,320
this is our home.

272
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,270
Until this is resolved,

273
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,460
we don't wish

274
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,090
to set foot in the Qi Kingdom.

275
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,840
I understand.

276
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,960
But if anyone

277
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,790
should be thankful, it's me.

278
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,390
Thank you for waking me up,

279
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,790
for reminding me

280
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,030
what the living

281
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,390
should do.

282
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,910
I promise you,

283
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,320
my friends and I

284
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,150
will make sure the people of Haiya

285
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,070
get an answer.

286
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,010
Let us help.

287
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,140
-Thank you.
-Let me.

288
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,720
Thank you, Miss Xiaoyue and Miss Luo,

289
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,790
for looking after us all this time.

290
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,790
Don't mention it.

291
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,030
Thank you.

292
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,390
We couldn't have done it

293
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,390
without your help.

294
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,320
That hope—

295
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,850
we'll keep it in our hearts

296
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,560
and never go back on our word.

297
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,320
Farewell.

298
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,600
Take care.

299
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,010
This white jade thumb ring

300
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:54,840
was the key

301
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,650
Bei Hai gave my father back then,

302
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,890
but my father never told me a thing.

303
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,570
Master didn't tell you

304
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:02,980
because he wanted

305
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,440
to end all of this himself.

306
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,200
Beiming,

307
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,640
have you already...

308
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,240
It all started with

309
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,440
the Case of the Blood-Weeping Statues.

310
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,590
Back when the late emperor
was gravely ill,

311
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,850
those four officials were senior aides.

312
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,700
According to my father's records,

313
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,680
these four officials were the ones

314
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,600
[Kill]

315
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,810
who orchestrated the Haiya massacre.

316
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,110
When Yesha took revenge,

317
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,790
they were on the kill list.

318
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,460
My father served in the Canfeng Army.

319
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,230
He knew right away

320
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,200
that the Case of the Blood-Weeping Statues

321
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,310
was connected to Haiya.

322
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,160
Not just that,

323
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,750
even before the Fengbo Lake case,

324
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,720
Master had already known

325
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
who Yesha was.

326
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,070
The real Yesha,

327
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,440
or rather the first Yesha,

328
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,680
was Miao Jie.

329
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,550
Miao Jie?

330
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,590
After the Canfeng Army disbanded,

331
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,590
Miao Jie transferred
to the Ministry of Personnel

332
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,350
and later became
the Minister of the Imperial Secretariat.

333
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,880
With the intelligence network
of the Imperial Secretariat,

334
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,930
he could easily track those

335
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,070
who advised

336
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,270
and promoted the massacre,

337
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,480
as well as the whereabouts
of the Canfeng Army members.

338
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,510
But that isn't enough to prove

339
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,880
that Yesha was Miao Jie.

340
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,050
[Zhong Yunchi]

341
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,400
That's right.

342
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,960
He served in the Canfeng Army too.

343
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,620
It makes no sense that after the massacre,

344
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,920
he'd seek revenge against himself.

345
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,640
Exactly.

346
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,760
Mr. Zhong and my father

347
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,070
were both in the Canfeng Army,

348
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,050
and they remained silent

349
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,480
about what happened back then.

350
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,040
There's no way

351
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,240
they had thought about revenge.

352
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:11,790
Because Miao Jie

353
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,400
was different from everyone else.

354
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,750
Miao Jie was from Haiya.

355
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,720
He witnessed his hometown

356
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,440
being massacred with his own eyes.

357
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,500
He was also the first orphan of Haiya.

358
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,790
How do you know

359
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,030
he was from Haiya?

360
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:29,000
This gesture looks familiar.

361
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,830
I think I saw it somewhere before.

362
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,510
This is the gesture

363
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,880
the Haiya people made
at Luo Sen's funeral.

364
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,590
That's right.

365
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,720
I asked Luo Shu about it.

366
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,350
She told me

367
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,750
it's a farewell gesture,

368
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,870
meant to guide the souls of the deceased

369
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:39,830
back to their homeland.

370
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,490
It's a custom unique to Haiya.

371
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,360
But that wasn't

372
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,790
the first time I'd seen it.

373
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,880
The first time

374
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,270
was three years ago.

375
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,880
Three years ago?

376
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,370
When I saw it,

377
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,000
I didn't think much of it.

378
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,640
I thought Miao Jie did it unintentionally.

379
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,470
[Lu Wenzhong] [Qin Ye]

380
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,880
But now it seems

381
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:54,690
[Shen Bi] [Huo Zongyao]

382
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,940
Miao Jie was indeed
bidding farewell to the dead,

383
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,260
[Zhong Yunchi] [Fan Jingzhi]

384
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,720
but the one he was saying goodbye to

385
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,880
was himself.

386
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,080
He wished

387
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,270
his soul could return home.

388
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,480
The entire Fengbo Lake case

389
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,510
was a death trap

390
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,200
that he and Master set for each other.

391
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,220
They used themselves as bait

392
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,870
and staked their lives on it.

393
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,270
I don't understand.

394
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,110
I just said

395
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,830
Master had known who Yesha was

396
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,720
before the Fengbo Lake case.

397
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,470
[Ghostly Judge Yin Er,
Psychic Mei Baiyu, Minister Miao Jie]

398
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,160
I understand now.

399
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,000
Miao Jie and my father
fought side by side on the battlefield.

400
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,400
My father knew he was from Haiya.

401
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,510
So when Miao Jie's name appeared

402
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,750
among the three suspects,

403
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,600
my father connected

404
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,350
all the dots.

405
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,680
From start to finish,

406
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,480
he had his eyes

407
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,480
on Miao Jie alone.

408
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,200
Exactly.

409
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,790
And Master knew

410
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,880
that Miao Jie's next target

411
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,800
would be him.

412
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,930
That's why he set up

413
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,200
the trap at Fengbo Lake

414
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,070
and why he left final instructions
with us.

415
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,350
If I fall

416
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,720
in the fight with Yesha this time,

417
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,030
having you by her side

418
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,200
will set my mind at ease.

419
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,550
What exactly

420
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,550
was my father's plan at Fengbo Lake?

421
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,830
I believe Master's original plan

422
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,440
was to put knockout drops

423
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,590
in the tea on the ship.

424
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,160
The unsuspecting Yin Er and Mei Baiyu

425
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,510
would certainly drink it and pass out.

426
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,750
Miao Jie was right.

427
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,680
Master meant to kill him to silence him.

428
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,240
For the stability of the Qi Kingdom,

429
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,200
Master had already prepared

430
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,550
to sacrifice himself.

431
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,880
How was that possible?

432
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,720
Are you saying my father poisoned himself?

433
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,720
Because that poison was used twice.

434
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:16,640
What?

435
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,440
Back then, after Miao Jie fell for

436
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,680
the four-carriage trap,

437
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,880
he knew his identity

438
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,750
couldn't be hidden anymore,

439
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,400
and he knew our wedding

440
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,790
was just nothing but a trap.

441
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:25,960
He even foresaw

442
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,110
all of Master's plans.

443
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,070
So that means

444
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,460
the second poisoning…

445
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,960
It was done by Miao Jie.

446
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,280
He replaced the incense on the ship

447
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,310
with knockout drops,

448
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,330
so whether they drank

449
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:35,160
Master's tea or not,

450
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,510
they'd be poisoned and pass out—

451
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,440
something Master never anticipated.

452
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,250
Afterward, Zhu Yitie

453
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,350
followed Miao Jie's orders

454
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,350
and sewed and killed

455
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,720
everyone on the ship except me,

456
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,320
including Miao Jie himself.

457
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,920
This is the true story

458
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,600
behind the Fengbo Lake case.

459
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,400
If he had known

460
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,640
all the plans,

461
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,000
why didn't he run?

462
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,110
Why did he have to

463
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,160
kill himself too?

464
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,070
And why did he spare your life?

465
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,470
That doesn't make sense.

466
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,880
Because for Miao Jie,

467
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,750
his own death
was the most important step.

468
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,640
He wanted to use his death

469
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:04,790
to kill

470
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,320
three birds with one stone.

471
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,010
Three birds with one stone?

472
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,800
With his identity exposed,

473
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,030
killing Master

474
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,310
was his first goal.

475
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,270
And the second?

476
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,000
I was shot and fell into the lake.

477
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,960
I blacked out

478
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
and woke up in the shallows.

479
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,880
I thought I was just lucky,

480
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,030
but now I realize

481
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:23,990
Miao Jie must have

482
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,350
instructed his men ahead of time,

483
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,110
making sure

484
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,440
I could survive

485
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,720
and become a fugitive.

486
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,120
As long as you were alive,

487
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,420
everyone's attention

488
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,350
would be on you.

489
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,640
So his second goal

490
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,880
was to frame you.

491
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,270
No.

492
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,270
Framing me was just a cover-up.

493
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,550
His second goal

494
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,750
was to hide someone—

495
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,920
the one we've been fighting all this time.

496
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,580
That person

497
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,640
is also the one mentioned

498
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,200
by Qing Ying, Huang Wuchang, and Old Bug.

499
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,680
He should be a young man

500
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,160
who's the second Yesha.

501
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,750
The second Yesha?

502
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,310
Miao Jie used his own death

503
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,920
to mislead all investigations,

504
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,200
making it impossible for us to verify

505
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,460
whether Zhu Yitie's testimony was true.

506
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,750
My God,

507
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,160
how could someone

508
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,890
be so scheming and terrifying?

509
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,830
The most terrifying part isn't that.

510
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,290
Miao Jie's third goal—

511
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,110
and his most important one—

512
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,310
was me.

513
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,030
He framed you,

514
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,070
hid the second Yesha,

515
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,280
forced you into a dead end,

516
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,070
and nearly got you killed.

517
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,240
What more could he want?

518
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,110
From the moment I boarded that ship,

519
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,120
everything was already

520
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,450
part of Miao Jie's plan.

521
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,270
He knew

522
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:23,640
how close I was to Master,

523
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,200
and he knew my competitive nature.

524
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:25,830
Look,

525
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,640
I'm here with the guests.

526
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,000
Nothing's improper here.

527
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,830
Father, I...

528
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,550
Beiming, go back.

529
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,270
Mr. Zhong,

530
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,510
since the groom wants to come

531
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,000
and the bride doesn't mind,

532
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,640
why not let him

533
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,040
go out on the lake with us?

534
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,240
A long time ago,

535
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,590
on the border of the Qi Kingdom,

536
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,110
there was a small city

537
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,510
called Haiya.

538
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,200
-What do you want to say?
-King Zhong of Constables,

539
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,200
I suppose Constable Xiao has no idea

540
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,640
that you actually know

541
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,400
what Yesha really means.

542
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,400
Have you never told him

543
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,640
because you're afraid

544
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,550
he'll discover what you did back then?

545
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,680
So he deliberately mentioned

546
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,720
Haiya on the ship,

547
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,110
forcing Master to attack him.

548
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,640
Apart from making me suspect Master,

549
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,510
his real aim

550
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,640
was to etch the word "Haiya"

551
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,880
on my mind.

552
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
According to his plan,

553
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,510
he knew that after I escaped,

554
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,400
I'd dig into everything about Haiya

555
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,510
to uncover that history.

556
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,310
You mean

557
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,160
we...

558
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,030
Yes.

559
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,880
Us being here now

560
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,920
is also part of his plan.

561
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:20,930
How could he have

562
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,680
calculated things to this extent?

563
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,240
What about the second Yesha?

564
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,900
Have you figured out who it is?

565
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:39,400
[Miao Jie, male infant, Miao Yun]

566
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,830
The boy Miao Jie adopted back then.

567
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,030
Miao Yun?

568
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,160
If Miao Jie had been
planning revenge all along,

569
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,550
then the boy he adopted

570
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,430
would indeed be the perfect successor.

571
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,630
No, that's not right.

572
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,350
We looked into that child.

573
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,270
He

574
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,160
went missing.

575
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:55,920
Whether he is

576
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,960
the second Yesha or not,

577
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,360
we need to find him first.

578
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,720
With less than 30 miles to go,

579
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,510
we can reach the capital tomorrow.

580
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,640
We need to go faster.

581
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,160
Chief Fang is covering for us.

582
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,310
The sooner we get back,

583
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,270
the less trouble
for the Elite Constabulary Unit.

584
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,680
Then we'll travel through the night

585
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,680
and try to reach the capital by dawn.

586
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,480
We can go without rest,

587
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,010
but the horse needs to eat.

588
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,480
Alright then,

589
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,150
let's take a short break.

590
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,800
What's wrong?

591
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,300
Chief Fang has been taken
by the Secret Investigation Unit.

592
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,470
What happened?

593
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,640
Yesterday, my father

594
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,310
received a mysterious tip-off.

595
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,240
He then led men to storm

596
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,440
the Elite Constabulary Unit's prison.

597
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,240
Fang Tianzheng,

598
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,000
as the Chief
of the Elite Constabulary Unit,

599
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,480
you actually released a key criminal.

600
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,810
Have you lost your mind?

601
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,960
Tell me—

602
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,640
why did you release Xiao Beiming?

603
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,270
Where did he go?

604
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,320
Despite being tortured,

605
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,110
Chief Fang didn't say a word.

606
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,830
However, His Majesty has decreed

607
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,710
that if he doesn't confess within 10 days,

608
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,230
he'll be executed

609
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,680
for releasing a key criminal.

610
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,680
Fortunately, you sent me a message

611
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,830
by carrier pigeon a few days ago

612
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,030
and told me about Haiya.

613
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,080
Then I rushed here

614
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,310
as quickly as I could.

615
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,510
We need to hurry back

616
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,240
to save Chief Fang.

617
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,170
Absolutely not!

618
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,440
You are now

619
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,550
wanted criminals.

620
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,550
The Elite Constabulary Unit
has been shut down,

621
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,750
and everyone you know

622
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,110
is being watched
by the Secret Investigation Unit.

623
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,720
If you go back and get caught,

624
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,200
everything will be over.

625
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,320
But we've already uncovered

626
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,200
the secrets of Haiya

627
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:23,960
and figured out

628
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,960
Yesha's identity.

629
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,480
Yes.

630
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,110
If we go back and tell the truth,

631
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,240
proving that the Fengbo Lake case

632
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,510
had nothing to do with Beiming,

633
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,570
the charge of releasing a key criminal

634
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:31,700
can be re-examined,

635
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,560
and Chief Fang will be saved.

636
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,800
It's not too late

637
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,730
if we go back now.

638
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,830
Beiming.

639
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,750
Beiming.

640
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,650
We can't reveal ourselves yet.

641
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,440
Why not?

642
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,090
Even if we know

643
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,240
who the new Yesha is,

644
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,750
Miao Jie is already dead.

645
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,110
Right.

646
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,580
Even if all your deductions

647
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,350
are correct,

648
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,710
there isn't enough evidence

649
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:54,400
to prove them.

650
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,480
More importantly,

651
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,790
if we tried to prove

652
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:57,590
that I'm not Yesha

653
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,490
by revealing everything

654
00:27:58,490 --> 00:27:59,820
we discovered at Haiya,

655
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,210
it'd mean exposing

656
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,920
that dark history to everyone.

657
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,240
Neither His Majesty

658
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,590
nor the Qi Kingdom

659
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:06,880
is ready

660
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,070
to face it.

661
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,750
The nation would be thrown into chaos,

662
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,210
and that's exactly
what the new Yesha wants.

663
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,680
So we'll just stand by

664
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,560
and watch Chief Fang be executed?

665
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,440
There's only one way
to break this deadlock.

666
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,440
Within 10 days,

667
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,160
we must capture the new Yesha.

668
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,960
We need to find Miao Yun quickly.

669
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,970
You sent me a message

670
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,550
by carrier pigeon a few days ago,

671
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,310
so I looked into Miao Yun's whereabouts.

672
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:29,180
Miao Jie lived his entire life alone,

673
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,640
with no family or servants.

674
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,880
He even ate and slept
at the Imperial Secretariat.

675
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,270
He was aloof and cold

676
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,440
and never spoke of personal matters
to anyone,

677
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,680
so no one knew

678
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,880
he had an adopted son.

679
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,740
But his name is

680
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:40,830
on the registry.

681
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,480
He might have hidden Miao Yun somewhere.

682
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,510
I thought so too,

683
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,440
so I checked

684
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,030
all the documents related to him

685
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,550
and found that he bought a house

686
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,070
in Mount Nan, outside the capital.

687
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,070
Very suspicious.

688
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,680
Unfortunately, with what suddenly happened
with the Elite Constabulary Unit,

689
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,110
I never had the chance to check it out.

690
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,840
The situation has changed now.

691
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,240
If you continue investigating,

692
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,400
your father will become suspicious.

693
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,200
I understand.

694
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,020
I'll prepare some uniforms

695
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,720
of the Secret Investigation Unit for you.

696
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,640
But from now on,

697
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,160
you're on your own.

698
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,400
Thank you.

699
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,760
About Tong Shuang…

700
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,250
He was a good constable.

701
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,450
[Wanted]

702
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,790
This is the house Zhuge Kongyun

703
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:50,750
tracked down.

704
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,570
Miao Jie wouldn't have bought

705
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:54,400
such a rundown house
in these remote mountains for no reason.

706
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,060
Something's definitely off.

707
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,410
If Miao Jie had really raised Miao Yun

708
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:58,720
to become the second Yesha,

709
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,790
then the fewer people who knew,

710
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,640
the better.

711
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,210
A house in such a remote place

712
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:03,070
would be ideal.

713
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:04,640
But

714
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,680
there's no village for miles.

715
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:07,810
Who can we even ask?

716
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,580
Over there.

717
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,920
Excuse me, sir.

718
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,880
Secret Investigation Unit.

719
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:21,830
[Secret Investigation Unit]

720
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:22,680
Officers,

721
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,160
I'm just a physician.

722
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,000
I've just come back from gathering herbs.

723
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,640
Relax.

724
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,770
We just want to ask you a few questions.

725
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:30,420
Officers,

726
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,580
go ahead and ask.

727
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,460
I'll tell you everything I know.

728
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,140
Sir,

729
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,230
how long have you been
practicing medicine here?

730
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,840
I've been practicing medicine here

731
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,880
for over 10 years.

732
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,710
So the villagers nearby

733
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,570
all come to you when they're sick?

734
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,750
Folks living in Mount Nan

735
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:45,790
are all poor,

736
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,950
and it's hard for them
to go downtown for treatment,

737
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:48,660
so I

738
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,030
settled down here.

739
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:50,900
I usually

740
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,270
just treat small ailments

741
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,800
like headaches and fevers.

742
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,660
You're a true physician with a kind heart.

743
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,380
You flatter me.

744
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,510
It's just a physician's duty.

745
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,180
Sir,

746
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,350
have you ever treated anyone
from this house?

747
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,510
This house has been abandoned

748
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,620
for over 10 years,

749
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,550
but I do

750
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,470
remember its owner.

751
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:13,950
What do you remember?

752
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,750
It was when I

753
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,820
first started practicing medicine here.

754
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,620
It was pouring rain that day.

755
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:22,510
The owner of this house

756
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,620
told me

757
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,900
that his son had a high fever
that wouldn't break

758
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,360
and asked me to take a look.

759
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,230
My son has had a high fever for days.

760
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,230
He's unconscious

761
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,830
and rambling nonsense.

762
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,900
Don't worry. Let me examine him.

763
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,510
All right.

764
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:41,140
There were only two people in that house.

765
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,750
One glance at the boy,

766
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:43,660
and I never forgot him.

767
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,820
Why?

768
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,750
Because that boy was very unusual.

769
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,510
His entire body

770
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,900
was covered in scars

771
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:53,630
and all kinds of wounds,
both fresh and old.

772
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:55,800
And he had a slight limp.

773
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:57,540
Though just a child,

774
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,660
he looked like

775
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,340
an old soldier

776
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,140
who had just returned from battle.

777
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,790
It gave me quite a shock.

778
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:04,950
Sir,

779
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:05,790
do you still remember

780
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,190
what the boy looked like?

781
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:10,030
I can't recall his face,

782
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,340
but I do remember

783
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,620
that when I went,

784
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,470
he had been ill for a long time,

785
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,180
and his condition was very serious.

786
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,550
I prescribed two doses of medicine,

787
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,660
but they didn't help,

788
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,420
so I had no choice but to leave.

789
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,900
Later,

790
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,420
when I wanted to check on him again,

791
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,340
they had already moved away.

792
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,350
All right. Thank you for your help.

793
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,340
Judging by the dust

794
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,710
in the house,

795
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:41,750
it's been at least a decade

796
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:42,900
since anyone entered.

797
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,750
If what that physician said

798
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,750
is true,

799
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,140
Miao Jie must have taken Miao Yun away

800
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,100
for treatment.

801
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,550
But Miao Jie was
an Imperial Secretariat official.

802
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,030
According to Zhuge Kongyun,

803
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,990
he lived alone in the capital,

804
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,270
even residing in the Imperial Secretariat.

805
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,660
There's no way Miao Yun could have

806
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,750
stayed with him without being noticed.

807
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,470
So

808
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,900
he hid Miao Yun somewhere?

809
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:02,710
The Imperial Secretariat officials

810
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:04,340
didn't know about Miao Yun's existence.

811
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,580
Master and General Huo were both
in the capital,

812
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,380
and they also had adopted

813
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,340
Haiya orphans.

814
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,180
If he had deliberately hidden Miao Yun,

815
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,180
it'd have aroused their suspicion.

816
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:13,900
So how did he

817
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,710
conceal Miao Yun's existence

818
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,950
without drawing the attention of Mr. Zhong

819
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,420
and my father?

820
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,580
A method that Minister Miao Jie

821
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,660
would use,

822
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:27,720
but Yesha wouldn't.

823
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,380
You mean

824
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,750
the Cixin Orphanage?

825
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:35,010
[Cixin Orphanage]

826
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,070
I never knew

827
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,620
the Secret Investigation Unit
had female officers.

828
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,080
It's for the convenience of investigation.

829
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,820
The boy you're talking about, Miao Yun—

830
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,860
I remember him.

831
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,580
Is he still here?

832
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:52,990
He left long ago.

833
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:55,070
Do you know where he went?

834
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,860
Children leaving the Cixin Orphanage

835
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,230
should have records.

836
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,990
Regular children certainly do,

837
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,470
but Miao Yun

838
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,580
was an exception.

839
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,179
To be honest,

840
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,949
when he arrived,

841
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:12,139
he was already mentally impaired.

842
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:13,300
Mentally impaired?

843
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:15,620
We have a rule here—

844
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:17,389
never ask about a child's past.

845
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,030
As for who sent him here

846
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:20,949
or why he was mentally impaired,

847
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:22,070
nobody knows.

848
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:23,350
When he arrived,

849
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:25,100
he couldn't speak,

850
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:26,550
only smiled foolishly,

851
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:28,100
and often wandered off.

852
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:30,550
Shortly after, he disappeared.

853
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,780
We sent people to look for him

854
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,179
but never found him.

855
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,659
The matter

856
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:37,739
was eventually dropped.

857
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:40,699
Do you remember what he looked like?

858
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:42,389
I do.

859
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:44,219
He had

860
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:47,070
scars all over his face and body

861
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,179
and a limp in his right leg.

862
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:50,909
A truly pitiful boy.

863
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,429
Could you draw

864
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:55,560
his portrait for us?

865
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,140
It's been so long,

866
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,700
but I'll try.

867
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,560
So this is the second Yesha?

868
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:10,180
This boy with an intellectual disability

869
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,780
is Miao Jie's successor?

870
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,260
The intellectual disability
might be a disguise,

871
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,830
a way to deceive others.

872
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,580
After all, if he had been a normal child,

873
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,550
Miao Jie would have had no excuse

874
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,990
to send him to the Cixin Orphanage.

875
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:21,510
Whether Miao Yun was
actually mentally impaired

876
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,640
isn't the point now.

877
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,180
The point is—

878
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,470
where do we find him?

879
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:25,140
This is what he looked like

880
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,550
many years ago.

881
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,300
People's looks change.

882
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,700
Just one portrait

883
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,800
is far from enough.

884
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,300
Besides, we can't be sure

885
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,470
if he's in the capital.

886
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,140
Even if he is,

887
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,430
with the capital so large

888
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,620
and the few of us

889
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,780
hiding while searching,

890
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,180
there's not enough time.

891
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:10,610
Father.

892
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,260
What is it?

893
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:15,210
Regarding Chief Fang...

894
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,880
Regarding Fang Tianzheng's case,

895
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:19,580
I believe

896
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,830
there's more to it,

897
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,830
so could you please

898
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:24,030
petition His Majesty

899
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,950
to postpone the execution?

900
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,950
His Majesty's word is law.

901
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,220
How can it be changed so easily?

902
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:31,510
Besides,

903
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:34,580
the Chief of the Elite Constabulary Unit
turned traitor.

904
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,910
It's such a shocking scandal.

905
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:39,260
If we don't execute him quickly
to appease the public,

906
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,220
the imperial court will lose its dignity.

907
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,100
But Father,

908
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,660
you know better than anyone

909
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:46,270
that Fang Tianzheng is cautious and timid.

910
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,390
Could something

911
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:48,660
have happened

912
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,140
to force him

913
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,780
into such an audacious act?

914
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,510
You've seen for yourself

915
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:00,070
how tight-lipped he is now.

916
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,910
I no longer care about

917
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:03,550
why he turned traitor.

918
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:06,390
It's a fact
that he released a key criminal.

919
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,870
What we need to do

920
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:10,450
is capture Xiao Beiming
as soon as possible.

921
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:12,870
But Father,

922
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,870
have you considered one possibility?

923
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:16,300
Are you trying to say

924
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,780
that Xiao Beiming might not be Yesha?

925
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,900
I've been thinking about it.

926
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,830
Maybe Xiao Beiming

927
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:25,140
somehow

928
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,100
gained Fang Tianzheng's trust

929
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,350
and convinced him

930
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,780
he wasn't Yesha,

931
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,580
which is why Fang risked his life

932
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,700
to help clear his name.

933
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,100
After all, the Fengbo Lake case

934
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,180
and the Huang Wuchang case

935
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,350
are full of holes.

936
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,950
Full of holes?

937
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:42,030
What if there's

938
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,510
another possibility?

939
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,510
Maybe Xiao Beiming and Fang Tianzheng

940
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,570
were Yesha's accomplices all along.

941
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,030
Their sinister ambitions

942
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,220
were discovered by Zhong Yunchi,

943
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,830
so they killed him
on Fengbo Lake to silence him.

944
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:52,580
Then one fled,

945
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,870
and the other stayed
in the Elite Constabulary Unit

946
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,530
to continue their evil deeds.

947
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,870
After Xiao Beiming was captured,

948
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:00,180
Fang Tianzheng went to great lengths

949
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,430
to release him,

950
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,220
but his plot was exposed,

951
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,030
and he was caught on the spot.

952
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,510
Father,

953
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,180
d-don't you think that assumption

954
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:12,030
is too far-fetched?

955
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:14,300
You'd rather believe that a fugitive

956
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,700
might be wrongly accused

957
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:16,470
than trust

958
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,100
the evidence we've gathered.

959
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,560
Whose theory sounds more far-fetched here?

960
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,070
At this point,

961
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,660
I'll just speak my mind.

962
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,220
Regarding the Yesha case,

963
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,830
your approach and judgment

964
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,220
have never convinced me.

965
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,150
What did you say?

966
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,660
I still can't understand—

967
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:34,740
with so many

968
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,350
unanswered questions in the Yesha case,

969
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,350
why are you so sure

970
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,100
that Xiao Beiming is the only suspect?

971
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,990
If he truly had such malicious intent,

972
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:42,470
wouldn't the King of Constables,

973
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:44,320
who was so close to him, have noticed?

974
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,950
Because Zhong Yunchi himself was

975
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:47,750
a hypocritical and cunning man!

976
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,830
The Elite Constabulary Unit

977
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:51,870
appears righteous and honorable,

978
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:54,030
but they're actually filthy
and corrupt inside,

979
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,220
treacherous and despicable!

980
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,300
I'm not surprised by any evil deeds

981
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,350
committed by the disciples

982
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:58,740
and subordinates trained

983
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,180
by such a person!

984
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:00,990
Father,

985
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,550
why are you

986
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,150
so prejudiced against them?

987
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,510
Because I became like this

988
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,910
all because of Zhong Yunchi!

989
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:20,000
You keep calling him King of Constables,

990
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:22,100
but do you really know him?

991
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,220
Let me tell you—

992
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:24,510
I know Zhong Yunchi

993
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,180
better than anyone else.

994
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,220
Because I was once

995
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,430
a constable
in the Elite Constabulary Unit!
