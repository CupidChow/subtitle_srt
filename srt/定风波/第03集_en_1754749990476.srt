00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,630
after the Fengbo Lake case

191
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,910
three years ago,

192
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,960
the Elite Constabulary Unit is no longer
what it was before,

193
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,120
completely falling out of favor

194
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,440
with His Majesty.

195
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,200
The Secret Investigation Unit
is in charge of

196
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,150
every important and major case.

197
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,920
Especially your senior...

198
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,720
The Yesha case.

199
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,010
What on earth are you trying to say?

200
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,460
I want to work with you.

201
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,240
Work with me?

202
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:04,630
Over the past three years,

203
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,000
many murders following Yesha's method

204
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,840
have occurred.

205
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,870
At all the crime scenes,

206
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,670
his name was left.

207
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,120
Every time a case occurred,

208
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,750
you conducted an investigation.

209
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,910
But in the end?

210
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,630
They just imitated him

211
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,150
to frame him.

212
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,030
It's been three years.

213
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,440
Yucheng, Kuizhou,

214
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,080
East Sea, and West Wastelands.

215
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,510
You've been to so many places

216
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,790
and solved so many cases,

217
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,320
but you've still failed to find him.

218
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:26,960
Am I right?

219
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,030
Why don't you consider working with me?

220
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,430
We can find him together.

221
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,030
No need.

222
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,390
In this world,

223
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,960
besides you,

224
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,440
I want to find him more than anyone else.

225
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,480
Now you have proved

226
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,000
your ability to investigate a case
and hunt for a murderer.

227
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,550
And we have the same goal.

228
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,790
If we work together

229
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,960
and share information,

230
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,750
we will find him

231
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,720
in time.

232
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,870
I told you I don't need it.

233
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,130
What else do you want to say?

234
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,380
I've always wanted to ask you.

235
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,950
You don't think

236
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,120
Xiao Beiming

237
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,850
is the murder of the Fengbo Lake case,
right?

238
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,640
I only believe in evidence.

239
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,310
Fengbo Lake was tightly surrounded
that day.

240
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,480
At the crime scene,

241
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,550
no one else

242
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:14,640
could get a chance to get on the boat
to commit murder.

243
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,790
Per the coroner's exam results,

244
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,750
the people on the boat
were all poisoned by knockout drops.

245
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,470
Then, they were sewn and murdered

246
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,950
while in a coma.

247
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:21,930
However, Xiao Beiming

248
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,480
was the only sober person.

249
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:24,160
He escaped

250
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,750
right under the crowd's noses.

251
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,400
We have solid evidence.

252
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,920
We both know his talent.

253
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,960
If he's not Yesha,

254
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,920
why did he run away?

255
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,510
If he is really wronged,

256
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,550
over the past three years,

257
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,830
why hasn't he shown up

258
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,030
and proved his innocence?

259
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,630
That's why I need to find him.

260
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,350
I must uncover the truth

261
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,550
from back then.

262
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,200
If you really catch him,

263
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,110
and if he admits it,

264
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,310
what will you do?

265
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,090
I will kill him myself.

266
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:06,520
[Eastern suburbs, the capital]

267
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,680
It's a sewn corpse.

268

Xueman.

269
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,720
Long time no see.

270
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,960
Xiao Beiming, you finally showed yourself.

271
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,480
I didn't kill Master.

272
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,460
I gave you

273
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,810
the clue you got.

274
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,400
I know

275
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,860
you would find this place.

276
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,310
For the past three years,

277
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,480
I've been tracking leads

278
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,640
on Yesha.

279
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,240
Xueman,

280
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,550
if you're willing to believe me,

281
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,070
I will prove to you personally that

282
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,750
what happened on the boat

283
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,960
at Fengbo Lake three years ago

284
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,400
is never my doing.

285
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,640
Why should I trust you?

286
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,160
Don't move.

287
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,310
If you move again,

288
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,640
I'll kill you right now.

289
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,250
I'll show you the evidence.

290
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,590
You also found these pinholes

291
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,270
come from three crime scenes.

292
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,170
The victims are three brides.

293
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,240
But they weren't burnt

294
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,590
but rather

295
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,200
sewn to death.

296
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,240
These pinholes

297
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,970
are exactly the same as

298
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,070
those on the boat at Fengbo Lake
three years ago.

299
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,110
It means

300
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,070
Yesha has reappeared.

301
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,600
You showed up right when the sewing murder
happened.

302
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,880
Doesn't that just mean

303
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,960
you are Yesha?

304
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,270
Master's tunnel

305
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,160
is a good place to hide.

306
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,110
If you

307
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,510
don't make it clear,

308
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,350
this place can be your grave.

309
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,920
I spared your life

310
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:03,870
because I want

311
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:04,830
to know what on earth happened

312
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,230
at Fengbo Lake back then.

313
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,310
My dad treated you like his own son.

314
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,550
Why did you do that?

315
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,000
If you dare to lie,

316
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,730
I'll kill you immediately.

317
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,110
I can only tell you,

318
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,350
not long after I got on the boat,

319
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,270
I passed out.

320
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:24,750
When I woke up,

321
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,720
what I saw is exactly the same

322
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,720
as what you saw.

00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,550
As for what happened during the period
when I passed out,

324
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,150
I also know nothing about it.

Whether you believe me or not,

326

I can only tell you

327
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,110
that I'm not Yesha.

328
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,500
You still won't tell me?

330
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:56,720

378
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,340
he or she will die in half a day.

379
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,640
This one is called Heart-piercing Arrow.

380
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,920
It will attack the heart directly

381
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,920
with no visible wounds left.

382
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,510
Take it, one's heart will race like crazy,

383
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,270
and he will die

384
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,980
in an hour if there's no antidote.

385
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,640
I'm not trying to kill anyone.

386
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,380
Is there any medicine that can

387
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:27,110
seal someone's internal energy

388
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,400
and martial arts skills, depriving

389
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,440
him of his strength

390
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,920
to make him even unable to stand up?

391
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,750
Yes.

392
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,680
This one!

393
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,720
This is called Paralysis Pill.

394
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,270
Even a cow will be paralyzed

395
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,790
after taking it.

396
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,000
If you feed it to a man,

397
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,400
even the top martial artist

398
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,110
will be as weak

399
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,240
as a baby for half a month.

400
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:42,960
Even someone like me

401
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,310
can beat him up.

402
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,570
Then I'll take this.

403
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,640
My decoction h-has dried up!

404
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,440
Take it.

405
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,750
Thank you.

406
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,400
Constable Zhong!

407
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,770
Feel free to come again!

408
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,350
I've finally got a chance

409
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,160
to repay her help.

410
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,510
My decoction h-has dried up!

411
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,310
Take it.

412
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,310
Oh no.

413
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,270
Use the medicine
to deprive me of my internal energy

414
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,920
and prevent me from fleeing away.

415
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,590
And it'll make the interrogation easier.

416
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,590
Cut the crap.

417
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,880
You keep saying you're innocent.

418
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,160
What?

419
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,500
Afraid I'll kill you with poison?

420
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,410
You don't have to go through

421
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,310
all this trouble if you want to kill me.

422
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,790
I chose to show up today,

423
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,310
and I never thought of running away.

424
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,680
Cut it out.

425
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,680
If you are wronged,

426
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:01,360
why have you been hiding
for three whole years

427
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,790
until another sewing murder case
occurred in the capital?

428
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,990
You appeared at the scene immediately!

429
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:11,070
Because he's disappeared
for three years as well.

430
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,880
Were it not for
another sewing murder case in the capital,

431
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,880
I would have kept lurking in the dark

432
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,310
and continued to investigate it

433
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,480
just like the way you looked for me

434
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,030
before catching him.

435
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,200
I showed up at the crime scene today

436
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,250
because I was betting my life.

437
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,160
On what?

438
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,750
On a person.

439
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,400
Even if everyone
in the Qi Kingdom believes

440
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,270
I am Yesha,

441
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,150
there's still one person

442
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:38,920
who will definitely

443
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,320
suspect it and get
to the bottom of it for me.

444
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,720
Because no one

445
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,120
knows me better than her.

446
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,680
I met her today

447
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,750
because I was betting on her suspicion.

448
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,720
If she really thought

449
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,310
I killed her father,

450
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,200
when we met today,

451
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,400
her Bi'an Sword

452
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,910
should have pierced my heart

453
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,920
instead of my shoulder.

454
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,510
I'm not asking you

455
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,000
to completely forgive me.

456
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,030
But I hope you can

457
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,880
keep this trace of suspicion

458
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,730
and let me stay by your side

459
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,780
to investigate the case with you.

460
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:26,720
I promise you

461
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,780
I won't let him get away with it again.

462
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,960
I will fetch you the truth

463
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,640
submerged in the Fengbo Lake
three years ago

464
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,270
with my own hands.

465
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,350
Constable Zhong.

466
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,830
Constable Zhong.

467
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,920
Constable Zhong.

468
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,550
C-Constable Zhong.

469
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,680
Constable Zhong!

470
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,720
Coroner Feng, what's wrong?

471
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,770
Constable Zhong!

472
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:11,900
The medicine!

473
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:12,880
I gave you the wrong one!

474
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,680
Did you take it?

475
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,080
Did you feed it to others?

476
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,830
What happened?

477
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,640
It's all my fault.

478
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,310
I gave you the bottle

479
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,640
without taking a close look.

480
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,920
You didn't take the Paralysis Pill,

481
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,830
but the Blood-freezing Frost.

482
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:34,920
What is it?

483
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,800
A deadly

484
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,350
and extremely rare poison.

485
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,440
How could you mix it up

486
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,440
with a deadly poison?

487
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,040
I'm sorry.

488
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,070
But it's not the time to blame me.

489
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,590
Let me give him some acupuncture.

490
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,520
Maybe there's a chance to save him.

491
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,700
Constable Zhong,

492
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,030
I'll give him acupuncture treatment.

493
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,890
Can you leave us alone for a while?

494
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,750
Why did he kill my father?

495
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,160
He killed several officers,

496
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:34,960
including your father,

497
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,550
just to stir up rumors

498
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:37,920
and spread fear.

499
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,960
The case about the statue's
tears of blood was done in secret.

500
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,720
But the Fengbo Lake case is different.

501
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,750
Don't forget that

502
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,790
it was my wedding day.

503
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,070
We were surrounded by our men.

504
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,070
Even if he made it,

505
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,640
he'd have been spotted.

506
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:51,600
My father

507
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:53,030
and the others were already in a coma

508
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,050
because of the knockout drops.

509
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,850
It was as easy as pie to kill them.

510
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,550
Why did he have to

511
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,550
choose the cruelest sewing murder?

512
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,270
The sewing murder technique

513
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:04,000
is not something
that can be mastered overnight.

514
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,680
I had spent more than ten years with him.

515
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,750
If he really were

516
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,920
a crazy murderer

517
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,690
who managed to hide it from me,

518
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,620
could he have deceived my dad?

519
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,400
Even if everyone in the Qi Kingdom

520
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,790
believes I am Yesha,

521
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,710
there's still one person

522
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,590
who will definitely

523
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,990
suspect it and get
to the bottom of it for me.

524
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,160
Constable Zhong!

525
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,000
How is he now?

526
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,790
Though I've used acupuncture on him,

527
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:30,310
the frost toxin

528
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,150
has already infiltrated into his body.

529
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:34,000
Blood-freezing Frost
is a slow-acting poison.

530
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,080
It will gradually seep

531
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,810
into his organs and meridians.

532
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,270
You mean there's no way to cure him.

533
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,110
Not really.

534
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,690
I've held the poison at bay.

535
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,200
He still has some time

536
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,830
before the next outbreak.

537
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,550
But as for how many days he can survive—

538
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,720
several months or several years—

539
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,180
it all depends on himself.

540
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,960
If we can find the antidote,

541
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,590
maybe

542
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:54,200
there's still a chance to save him.

543
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,800
You don't have the antidote?

544
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,640
This poison is extremely thorny.

545
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,240
All these years,

546
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,480
I've been working on the antidote.

547
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,110
But

548
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,790
no progress so far.

549
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,960
But don't worry.

550
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:10,000
The felon has lost all his martial arts

551
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,200
and internal energy.

552
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,640
Constable Zhong,

553
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,310
sorry for getting you into trouble.

554
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,030
Despite his identity as a felon,

555
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:19,110
I caused you to use the wrong poison.

556
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,350
I will go back with you

557
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,750
to explain it to the unit.

558
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,680
Be it imprisonment or punishment,

559
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,070
I won't implicate you.

560
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,300
[Wanted]

561
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,200
A fugitive?

562
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,590
He is Yesha, Xiao Beiming?

563
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,790
He is Yesha?

564
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,270
Good gracious!

565
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,150
It's okay, Constable Zhong.

566
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,640
Thank God we deprived him

567
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,700
of his martial arts

568
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,060
and internal energy!

569
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,160
Constable Zhong,

570
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,400
this is a great merit!

571
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,510
You caught Yesha!

572
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,030
And I made him...

573
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:51,640
Shut up!

574
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,510
Don't worry.

575
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,160
You won't die for now.

576
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:18,790
Thanks.

577
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,590
No, no.

578
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,960
I'm still not sure

579
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,600
if it's a merit or a mistake.

580
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Constable Zhong,

581
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,970
about the Fengbo Lake case,

582
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:31,680
I know

583
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,540
you still have a lot of questions.

584
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:52,790
You said you fainted

585
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,450
soon after boarding the ship.

586
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,790
But I saw you holding a weapon

587
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:56,660
in front of my father

588
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,860
with my own eyes.

589
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,530
How do you explain that?

590
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,640
I did black out.

591
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,550
And then I woke up

592
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,880
to the scene where the Master
and the other three

593
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,400
were all sewn and murdered.

594
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,070
The first thing I did

595
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,530
was try to save the Master.

596
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:10,400
But the Master was sewn

597
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,929
onto the corner of the ship.

598
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:12,800
When I just pulled

599
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,330
the steel needle out of him,

600
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,630
you showed up.

601
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,429
I was poisoned back then.

602
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,889
My tongue was numb, and I couldn't speak.

603
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,670
Then I was shot by an arrow

604
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,560
and fell off the boat.

605
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,800
The four victims

606
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,550
were indeed hit with knockout drops,

607
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,110
leaving them

608
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,570
no strength to fight back.

609
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:30,760
As for whether you were poisoned,

610
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,360
that's just your statement.

611
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,440
Five people on the ship.

612
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,400
Four died.

613
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,199
You can make up a story as you please.

614
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,000
It can't be counted as evidence.

615
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:38,840
Of course.

616
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,530
If you didn't murder them,

617
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,920
with the four of them being drugged,

618
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,630
who could sew and kill the others

619
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,480
and himself

620
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,550
in that state,

621
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,670
letting you survive?

622
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,420
This is also what confuses me.

623
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,880
As you said,

624
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:52,880
there's no way

625
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,190
the murderer sewn and killed

626
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,110
the others and himself

627
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,230
after being drugged.

628
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:56,630
But what if

629
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,360
there is another possibility?

630
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,110
What if there was

631
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,670
a sixth man on the ship

632
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,320
besides the five of us?

633
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,360
Impossible.

634
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:07,370
Fengbo Lake was heavily guarded.

635
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,070
I was watching from upstairs
the whole time.

636
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,230
Anyone who tried to board the ship

637
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,630
would surely be spotted.

638
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,560
What if he was there the whole time?

639
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,230
I was too cocky three years ago.

640
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,150
I made an inference

641
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,550
that even misled myself.

642
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,190
I thought there was only one Yesha.

643
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,650
Over the past three years,

644
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,400
I've never stopped deducing.

645
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,280
From the murders of several ministers

646
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,800
to the Fengbo Lake case,

647
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:43,450
the victims died in different ways.

648
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,230
So,

649
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,920
I came up with an assumption.

650
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,360
If these people

651
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,880
were not killed by the same guy,

652
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,800
then the so-called Yesha

653
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,190
should be more than one person.

654
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,190
Yesha might be

655
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,520
an evil group scheming for something big.

656
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,670
How can you prove it?

657
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,590
I understand that

658
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,280
I can't win your trust

659
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,360
just with some deductions.

660
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,150
But one thing's for sure.

661
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,880
There are countless killers in this world,

662
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,150
but a lunatic who's skilled
in killing by sewing

663
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,610
should be one in a million.

664
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,880
Ordinary people can hardly do that.

665
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,670
Or maybe you

666
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:14,760
had been practicing

667
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,150
this evil technique

668
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,710
behind everyone's back.

669
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:19,280
You still have no solid evidence.

670
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,000
Of course.

671
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,550
Let's not talk about whether

672
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,610
this evil man is me.

673
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,510
He is good at sewing murder,

674
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:25,910
so let's call him Tailor.

675
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,920
The recent three
sewing murder cases in the capital

676
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,280
are exactly the same in method

677
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,140
as the Fengbo Lake case back then.

678
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,630
If they were all done by Tailor,

679
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,670
as long as we catch him,

680
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,880
we'll get the evidence

681
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,630
to prove that

682
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,000
I'm not the culprit

683
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,730
of the Fengbo Lake case.

684
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,400
If you're telling the truth,

685
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,400
why were

686
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,670
the bodies in the three cases

687
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,670
all burned?

688
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,590
The burning

689
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:48,590
and the victims' blood coagulation

690
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,880
didn't happen at the same time.

691
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,190
They were sewn and killed first,
and then burned.

692
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,280
Someone burned their bodies

693
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,550
to cover up the truth

694
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,630
deliberately.

695
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,110
If Tailor really exists,

696
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,710
why did he sew and kill them first,
and then burn the bodies?

697
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,230
Wasn't that unnecessary?

698
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,050
Tailor didn't burn the bodies.

699
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,280
It was the Elite Constabulary Unit.

700
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,480
Let's go.

701
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,550
I found this

702
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,920
at the crime scene.

703
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,630
You know what this is.

704
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:31,360
Isn't it
the Elite Constabulary Unit's igniter?

705
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:32,470
Sorry.

706
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,110
You two go on.

707
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,030
It's Fang Tianzheng.

708
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:39,840
Exactly.

709
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,510
Since the Fengbo Lake case,

710
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,480
the Elite Constabulary Unit

711
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,760
has lost His Majesty's favor.

712
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,710
Even the Yesha case has been handed

713
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:45,920
over to the Secret Investigation Unit.

714
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,800
Now the sewing murders occurred again.

715
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,480
I guess

716
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,710
Fang Tianzheng wants to

717
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,150
cover it up to avoid

718
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,710
unnecessary trouble

719
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,710
by burning the corpses.

720
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,630
Even if what you said is true,

721
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,400
as the sewing murders did happen,

722
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,230
it still can't prove

723
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,400
the existence of Tailor.

724
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,210
Neither can it prove

725
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:03,400
that you're not the so-called
Yesha and Tailor.

726
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,600
Do you have a map here?

727
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,400
Western suburbs.

728
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,000
No case has occurred there.

729
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,800
The victims

730
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,710
are all weak,

731
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,770
female newlyweds.

732
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,040
Tailor brought these brides

733
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,400
to such a remote place,

734
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,630
sewn and killed them.

735
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,550
It was meticulously arranged

736
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:30,810
for a special purpose.

737
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:34,190
Then what do they want?

738
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:36,760
East,

739
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,630
south,

740
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,550
west,

741
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,480
and north.

742
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,190
These four directions

743
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,790
are of special significance

744
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,570
in the legend of the Qi Kingdom.

745
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,510
Constable Zhong,

746
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,600
you are familiar with folk novels.

747
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:50,840
Do these four directions

748
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,170
remind you of anything?

749
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,100
[Eastern suburbs]

750
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,680
[Map of the Capital of Qi]

751
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,440
Four Devils Formation?

752
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,810
What is the Four Devils Formation?

753
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:10,890
When the Qi Kingdom was founded,

754
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,760
the former dynasty didn't give up.

755
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,190
They set up the Four Devils Formation
around the capital.

00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,400
Word has it that those who died

757
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,070
in the formation in wedding clothes

758
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,320
will be haunted by devils forever

759
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,980
and never go to the afterlife.

760
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,400
Tailor committed the three sewing murders

761
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,070
at the three corners
of the Four Devils Formation.

[Eastern suburbs]

763
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,630
That means

764
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,870
there will be the fourth sewing murder.

765
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:33,400
If there's really going
to be the fourth one,

766
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,660
then it will happen...

767
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:35,840
What time is it now?

768
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,800
It's just past 3 a.m.

769
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,590
The corpse-sewing cases happened

770
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:40,920
every three days in the capital.

771
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,590
And today

772
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,150
happens to be the third day

773
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,280
after the third case.

774
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,410
Previous cases all happened at night.

775
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:47,320
If Tailor really

776
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,880
killed based on the Four Devils Formation,

then tonight, there might be

779
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:52,400
the fourth murder in the western suburbs.

780
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,530
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

781
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,710
Keep an eye on him before I come back.

782
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:58,840
Let no one out.

783
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,550
Wait.

784
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:01,800
No one has ever seen

785
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,840
Tailor's real face.

786
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,240
We don't know how good
he is at martial arts.
