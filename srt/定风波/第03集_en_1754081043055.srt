You'll die

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,400
2 days before

5
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,300
Another typed

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,320
Doctor Chen

7
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:09,880
Yes

8
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,520
Who's the Doctor?

9
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:16,800
Doctor Su

10
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:17,400
That's me

11
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:17,880
Brother nÃ£o

12
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,840
Didn't you see her

13
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:19,760
Yeah

14
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,080
That's me

15
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,040
its me

16
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,800
Brother

17
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,040
I saw she

18
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,640
She came after you

19
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,480
And now I finally

20
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,920
I heart her

21
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:29,920
Sis

22
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,960
Who are these people?

23
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,160
Take your clothes off!

24
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,160
My sister.

25
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,200

Come on.

69
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,920
Come on.

70
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,920
Senior!

71
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,920
Senior, save me!

72
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,920
It's the Chinese elephant that's trying to steal my hand!

73
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,920
There it is.

74
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,920
Come on.

75
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,920
Come on.

76
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,920
Where are the files of Fan Shi'an?

77
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,920
How would I know?

78
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,920
Find it yourself.

79
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,920
When did you get this place?

80
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,920
I just said I was appointed.

81
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,920
The case is in the Shen Buying's attention.

82
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,920
Every clue in the file

83
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,920
could be the key to the case.

84
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,920
The files here are always neatly arranged.

85
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,920
They're not even a little bit.

86
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,920
Now you've ruined it like this.

87
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,920
You're a chicken with a chicken egg.

88
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,920
You're full of bones.

89
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,920
Just eat it.

90
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,920
I don't care how you got this position.

91
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,920
You're the one who's on the right track.

92
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,920
You should be loyal to the army.

93
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,920
What was the original look of the file?

94
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,920
What did you restore to me?

95
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,920
Zhong Xue Man, who do you think you are?

96
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,920
Do you know the name of the Shen Buying now?

97
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,920
Do you know?

98
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,920
I'll let you recover immediately.

99
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,920
I won't.

100
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,920
Chief, the eastern suburb forest has been taken care of.

101
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,920
This case is of great importance.

102
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,920
Before the real murderer catches the goods,

103
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,920
all the clues must be strictly kept secret.

104
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,920
Deputy Chief, this is the leader of the Yulin Wolf,

105
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,920
General Huo Zongyao.

106
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,920
General Huo.

107
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,920
You can't tell anyone about the people in Shen Buying.

108
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,920
Chief, you mean...

109
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,920
I heard that he went back to Beijing today.

110
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,920
I understand.

111
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,920
Yi Tie, you've been in office for less than three years.

112
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,920
You're thoughtful and careful.

113
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,920
I've been trying to remind you.

114
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,920
This is a good opportunity.

115
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,920
Do it well.

116
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,920
I won't let you down, Deputy Chief.

117
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,920
Tong Shuang.

118
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,920
Yes.

119
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,920
I'm sorry.

120
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,920
You're new here.

121
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,920
You'll be successful in a few days.

122
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,920
But you have to learn from Zhu today.

123
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,920
I understand.

124
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,920
During the sub-class,

125
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,920
the sword and the token must be kept.

126
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,920
The left and the token must be kept.

127
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,920
This is the rule of Shen Buying.

128
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,920
You remember it well.

129
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,920
What if it's the left side?

130
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,920
Are you sure?

131
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,920
No.

132
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,920
Then follow the rules.

133
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,920
I understand.

134
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,920
When there's no case,

135
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,920
you must be on time.

136
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,920
You must be on time at noon and late at night.

137
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,920
You can only be on time.

138
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,920
If you're late tomorrow,

139
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,920
go to the street and take the punishment.

140
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,920
Senior.

141
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,920
Who's following Shen Buying?

142
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,920
Mr. Hao.

143
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,920
Damn it.

144
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,920
It's heavy.

145
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,920
Good timing. Come and help.

146
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,920
What's wrong?

147
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,920
Move.

148
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,920
Junior.

149
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,920
Get up.

150
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,920
What's wrong?

151
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,920
Why are you fighting?

152
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,920
Senior.

153
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,920
You too.

154
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,920
This is Zhong Xue Man, the daughter of Lord Zhong Bu.

155
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,920
Zhong Xue Man?

156
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,920
I put it here just now.

157
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,920
I didn't lose it.

158
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,920
Pick it up right away.

159
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,920
I'll take this scroll first.

160
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,920
It's not closed yet.

161
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,920
Okay.

162
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,920
That's it.

163
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,920
Don't stand there.

164
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,920
Just do what you should do.

165
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,920
Okay.

166
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,920
Young Master.

167
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,920
I just got the news.

168
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,920
After Zhong Xue Man returned to Shen Buying,

169
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,920
I saw the recent machine that happened in the capital.

170
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,920
The selection of the Fenshi case.

171
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,920
Fenshi case?

172
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,920
I've been named as Zhen Ying.

173
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,920
I've transferred the files here.

174
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
Zhong Xue Man has been

175
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,920
investigating the clues of Xiao Bei Ming all these years.

176
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,920
How could he be interested in such a case?

177
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,920
There is only one possibility.

178
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,920
This case is related to Xiao Bei Ming.

179
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,520
The royal court Biden and the northerner airflow's

180
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,400
investigation is performed according to

181
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:43,780
the supporting

182
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,920
What are theyï¿½ï¿½

183
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,880
Pure í

184
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,920
He was shot by a sword and was badly injured.

185
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,920
He could only jump into the stormy lake and escape.

186
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,920
He had no chance to escape.

187
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,920
It's been three years since then.

188
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,920
Who saw the thief?

189
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,920
The most miserable thing is that

190
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,920
he was raised by his own son,

191
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,920
the King of Zhongbu.

192
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:13,920
He was killed by him.

193
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,920
He was a cruel man.

194
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,920
He was a good man.

195
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,920
He was not only cruel,

196
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,920
but also a man of high rank.

197
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,920
Have some grapes.

198
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,920
You still have a bad temper.

199
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,920
Just say it.

200
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,920
I don't like you

201
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,920
the way you are now.

202
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,920
Wait.

203
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,920
I have something to tell you.

204
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,920
About Xiao Beiming.

205
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,920
You know that

206
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,920
three years ago,

207
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,920
after the stormy lake,

208
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,920
your Shen Buying was no longer the same.

209
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,920
He lost his reputation in front of His Majesty.

210
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,920
I was in charge of all the cases.

211
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,920
Especially your senior.

212
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,920
Ye Sha's case.

213
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,920
What do you want to say?

214
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,920
I want to cooperate with you.

215
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,920
Cooperate?

216
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,920
There have been many cases

217
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,920
that have been against the law of Ye Sha.

218
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,920
The crime scene

219
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,920
left the name of Ye Sha.

220
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,920
Every time it happened,

221
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,920
you had to investigate it.

222
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,920
But the result

223
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,920
was just a mutual help.

224
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,920
You were accused of fraud.

225
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,920
Three years.

226
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,920
Yucheng, Kuizhou,

227
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,920
Donghai, Xihua.

228
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,920
You went to so many places

229
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,920
and handled so many cases.

230
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,920
But you still haven't found him.

231
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,920
Isn't it?

232
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,920
Why don't you consider cooperating with me?

233
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,920
You and I will find him together.

234
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,920
No need.

235
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,920
The person who wants to find him the most in this world

236
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,920
is me except you.

237
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,920
You have now proven

238
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,920
your ability to investigate cases.

239
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,920
And I have a goal.

240
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,920
As long as we cooperate,

241
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,920
we will find him when the time comes.

242
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,920
I've said no need.

243
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,920
What else do you want to say?

244
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,920
Actually, I always want to ask you.

245
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,920
You don't think

246
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,920
the murderer of Feng Bo Lake

247
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,920
is Xiao Beiming, do you?

248
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,920
I only believe in evidence.

249
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,920
Feng Bo Lake was surrounded by the group.

250
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,920
At the crime scene,

251
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,920
there was no one else

252
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,920
who could board the ship to investigate the case.

253
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,920
Five testers were on board.

254
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,920
The people on board were hit by the Milon umbrella.

255
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,920
Then they were killed by Feng Sha in the coma.

256
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,920
Xiao Beiming was the only one who was awake.

257
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,920
He only escaped in the dark.

258
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,920
He is the master of evidence.

259
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,920
We know his talent best.

260
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,920
If he is not a night killer, why did he escape?

261
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,920
If he was really framed,

262
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,920
why didn't he show up

263
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,920
and prove his innocence for three years?

264
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,920
That's why I want to find him.

265
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,920
I want to ask the truth of that year.

266
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,920
If you really catch him,

267
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,920
he also admitted it.

268
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,920
What will you do?

269
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,920
I will kill him myself.

270
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,920
Good!

271
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,920
Feng Shi

272
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,920
It's Feng Shi.

273
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,920
Junior.

274
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,920
Long time no see.

275
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,920
Xiao Beiming, you finally show up.

276
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,920
I didn't kill the master.

277
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,920
I gave you the clue you received.

278
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,920
I know you will find it here.

279
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,920
These three years,

280
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,920
I have been pursuing the clue of the night killer.

281
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,920
Junior, if you believe me,

282
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,920
I will prove it to you.

283
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,920
I didn't do anything

284
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,920
that Feng Muhu did three years ago.

285
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,920
Why should I believe you?

286
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,920
Don't move.

287
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,920
If you move, I will kill you right now.

288
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,920
I will show you the evidence.

289
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,920
You also found these evidence.

290
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,920
From the three crime scenes,

291
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,920
the dead are three new women.

292
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,920
But they are not the broken-up.

293
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,920
But Feng Shi.

294
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,920
Feng Shi

295
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,920
Feng Shi

296
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,920
Feng Shi

297
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,920
Feng Shi

298
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,920
These evidence

299
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,920
is the same as the evidence on Feng Muhu's ship three years ago.

300
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,920
This means

301
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,920
the night killer shows up again.

302
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,920
You show up when Feng Shan case appears.

303
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,920
This doesn't mean you are the night killer.

304
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,920
Master's knife is a good place to stab.

305
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,920
If you don't make it clear today,

306
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,920
this is where you will die.

307
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,920
I saved your life

308
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,920
to know what happened

309
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,920
on Feng Muhu.

310
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,920
My father treated you as if you were a chicken.

311
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,920
Why did you do that?

312
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,920
If you dare to say a word,

313
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,920
I will kill you right now.

314
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,920
I will kill you right now.

315
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,920
I will kill you right now.

316
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,920
I will kill you right now.

317
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,920
I will kill you right now.

318
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,920
I will kill you right now.

319
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,920
I can only tell you

320
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,920
that I was on the ship for a long time.

321
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,920
It was exactly the same as what you saw when you woke up.

322
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,920
As for what happened in the middle,

323
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,920
I don't know.

324
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,920
Whether you believe me or not,

325
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,920
I only have one word.

326
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,920
I am not the night killer.

327
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,920
What are you talking about?

328
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,920
The night killer.

329
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,920
How can you say that?

330
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,920
I didn't kill you.

331
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,920
You have to kill me because of that.

332
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,920
How can you say that?

333
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,920
You have to kill me because of that.

334
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,920
Then I'll kill you.

335
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,920
No.

336
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,920
You have to kill me.

337
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,920
I'm sorry.

338
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,920
I'm sorry.

339
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,920
I'm sorry.

340
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,920
I'm sorry.

341
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,920
I'm sorry.

342
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,920
I'm sorry.

343
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,560
I think you're so impulsive.

344
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,160
This time, you're lucky.

345
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,040
I know I was wrong.

346
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,640
I'll be careful next time.

347
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,040
Dad, Senior is hurt.

348
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,160
Don't teach him.

349
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,560
I'm not talking about you.

350
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,080
I've taught you how to wrap the dirt.

351
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,920
You haven't learned it yet.

352
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,480
If you do this,

353
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,000
his wound will not get better for a month.

354
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,600
Dad, you...

355
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,320
Master.

356
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,960
Does it hurt?

357
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,400
Let Junior come.

358
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,280
Master.

359
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:56,960
Does it hurt?

360
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,040
Let Junior come.

361
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,400
You stink.

362
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,560
Master.

363
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,640
What happened that day?

364
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,800
Let me sit.

365
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,400
You're so clumsy.

366
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,840
Don't get me wrong.

367
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,760
This is not human.

368
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,840
I just want to see

369
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,920
what's the difference between

370
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,840
the human and the pig.

371
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,560
I want poison.

372
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,320
What about the official document of the Divine Camp?

373
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,240
It needs to be reported.

374
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,240
It's a serious crime.

375
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,720
It's not good to alert the enemy.

376
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,040
After I'm lost,

377
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,480
I'll report it to the camp.

378
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,280
You don't believe me?

379
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,800
My life is not going to be saved.

380
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,560
I'll never give up.

381
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,160
No need.

382
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,760
Just keep it a secret for me.

383
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,960
Don't know where are you from and where you're from.

384
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,320
These are all the poison that I'm keeping.

385
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,960
This poison is called Heart Tissue scar.

386
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,960
After having this,

387
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,080
the skin infected with blood and can't level up.

388
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,400
If there is noé utilized over half a day,

389
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,440
you have to die.

390
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,040
This is

391
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:38,840
Hmm esquJin.

392
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,160
No external wounds.

393
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,200
Only heart.

394
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:49,040
Duplicç¹¼çº h tem

395
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,520
the kind of medicine that can't stand up.

396
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,480
Yes, yes, yes.

397
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,240
This one.

398
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,400
This medicine is called Tan Tan Pill.

399
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,040
Even if it's a cow after taking it,

400
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,480
it has to be on the ground.

401
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,600
If you give it to someone,

402
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,040
no matter how powerful its martial arts are,

403
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,800
it won't be able to hold a chicken for half a month.

404
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,600
Someone like me

405
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,000
can give it two thousand.

406
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,040
Just this one.

407
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,280
I'm going to drink it up.

408
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,000
Take it.

409
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,400
Thanks.

410
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,040
Let's go.

411
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,920
Zhou Mokai, come again if you need me.

412
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,640
You should have given me a chance

413
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,400
to repay her kindness.

414
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,200
I have the medicine.

415
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:33,800
I'll open it.

416
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,480
Take it.

417
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,640
Oh no.

418
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,640
So, thisis the Set that Lu Zhao had.

419
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,040
Yes.

420
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,560
This whole thing is made by Sanxin.

421
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,520
Optimize the Professor Xiao Yan

422
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,040
so that he oven perspectives will be hidden.

423
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,360
Stop íï¿½ÐµÐ·iling me.

424
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,280
You become emotional by being so noticeable everywhere.

425
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,160
Sorry.

426
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,280
Alright.

427
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,840
Move over.

428
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,680
ishes.

429
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,000
Why do you always make trouble for me?

430
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,000
I choose to show up today

431
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,120
and never want to run away.

432
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,560
Don't do this.

433
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,720
If you are really innocent,

434
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,800
why don't you show up for three years?

435
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,600
When the crime in Beijing is recorded,

436
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,600
you'll show up at the scene right away.

437
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,040
Because he also disappeared for three years.

438
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,800
If it were not for the killing case in Beijing,

439
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,680
I may continue to hide in the crime scene.

440
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,480
If you find me,

441
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,680
I've been investigating it all the time.

442
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,120
I've been investigating it until I caught him.

443
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,240
I dared to go to the crime scene today.

444
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,080
I'm risking my life to hide.

445
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,360
What are you hiding from?

446
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,840
Hiding from a person.

447
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,200
Even if the whole Qi

448
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,480
believes that I am Ye Shang,

449
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,960
there is one person

450
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,360
who will leave me

451
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,720
the last trace.

452
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,440
Because no one knows me better than him.

453
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,040
I dared to meet him today

454
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,760
to hide from this trace.

455
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,200
If he really thinks

456
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,600
I'm his murderer,

457
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,680
then when we met today,

458
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,720
his secret weapon

459
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,080
pierced my heart

460
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,200
and not my shoulder.

461
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,040
I don't expect you to forgive me completely.

462
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,240
But I hope you can

463
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,880
keep this trace

464
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,960
and let me stay by your side

465
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,480
and investigate the case with you.

466
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,840
I promise you

467
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,600
I won't let him get away with it.

468
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,240
I will tell you the truth

469
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,000
that was buried in the windmills three years ago

470
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,600
and get it out for you.

471
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,120
X Crispy

472
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,560
Steven Sponge

473
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,200
ë§

474
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,960
I'm sorry.

475
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,600
Mr. Feng, what's wrong?

476
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,640
I'm sorry.

477
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,320
The medicine...

478
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,760
I made the wrong medicine.

479
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,560
You didn't eat it, right?

480
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,760
You didn't give it to anyone, right?

481
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,000
Hurry up.

482
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,960
What happened?

483
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,640
It's all my fault.

484
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,560
I gave you the medicine without looking carefully.

485
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,840
You didn't take the pill.

486
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,800
It's Ning Xuehan.

487
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,000
What's Ning Xuehan?

488
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,200
It's a rare poison.

489
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,320
It's such a powerful poison.

490
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,360
How could you make a mistake?

491
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,280
I'm sorry.

492
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,000
When Dai Tian wasn't blaming me,

493
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,520
you asked me to wake him up.

494
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,840
Maybe there's a way out.

495
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,040
Zhou Muhua, I'll wake him up.

496
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,320
Can you avoid it?

497
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,680
Zhu Muhua.

498
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,320
Zhu Muhua.

499
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:32,840
Mike,

500
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:35,840
this morning.

501
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,920
Is there something wrong with your nose?

502
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,080
Are you serious?

503
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,560
Let me go.

504
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,960
The few adults who killed your father

505
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,560
were all trying to create rumors

506
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,840
and scare the people.

507
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,560
The sad bloodshed is in the dark.

508
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,560
But the wind and fire are different.

509
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,760
Don't forget

510
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,720
that day was my happy night.

511
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,080
Even if you succeed in every step,

512
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,320
you will be seen.

513
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,040
My father and his friends were hit by the dragon umbrella

514
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,080
and were already unconscious.

515
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,560
Killing them is easy.

516
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,840
Why use the most cruel feng shui?

517
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,320
The feng shui

518
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,160
can't be practiced in one move.

519
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,480
I've been with him for more than ten years.

520
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,080
If he's really a crazy man who kills people like a horse,

521
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,400
even if he can hide it from me,

522
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,400
can he hide it from my father?

523
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,800
Even if the whole country believes that I'm Ye Shang,

524
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,400
there's one person

525
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,240
who will leave me the last trace.

526
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,040
Zhou Mugui.

527
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,960
How is he now?

528
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,760
He didn't go to the expedition just now.

529
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,760
But the coldness still enters his body.

530
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,800
The bloodshed is a chronic poison.

531
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,760
It will gradually enter his organs and meridians.

532
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,920
You mean he's out of life?

533
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,240
Not really.

534
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,600
I've suppressed the toxicity.

535
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,280
Before the next poisoning,

536
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,000
he can live for a while.

537
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,600
But how long can he live?

538
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,760
A few months or years?

539
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,920
It depends on him.

540
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,960
If he can find the antidote,

541
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,040
maybe he can be saved.

542
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,440
You don't have the antidote.

543
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,480
The poison is very sharp.

544
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,680
I've been developing antidotes these years.

545
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,800
But there's no progress.

546
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,920
But don't worry.

547
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,800
The drug dealer's martial arts are all lost.

548
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,960
He has no internal force.

549
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,080
Zhou Mugui, I've got you into trouble.

550
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,760
Although he's a drug dealer,

551
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,120
he used the poison because of me.

552
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,640
I will definitely go back to the camp with you to confess.

553
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,120
I will punish him.

554
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,960
I will never get you into trouble.

555
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,240
The fugitive?

556
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:50,920
He's...

557
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,040
He's Ye Sha, Shang Bei Bing.

558
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,120
He's Ye Sha.

559
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,680
I'm so scared.

560
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,080
It's okay, Zhou Mugui.

561
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,000
Luckily, I just destroyed his martial arts.

562
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,480
His internal force is also lost.

563
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,880
Zhou Mugui, this is a piece of cake.

564
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,880
You take care of Ye Sha.

565
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,600
I'll take care of his martial arts...

566
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,320
Shut up!

567
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,560
Don't worry.

568
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,320
You won't die for now.

569
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,840
Thank you.

570
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,680
You're welcome.

571
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,520
I don't know if it's a good deed or a bad one.

572
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,120
Zhou Mugui,

573
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,920
I'm sorry about what happened.

574
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,760
I'm sorry.

575
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,520
I'm sorry.

576
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,320
I'm sorry.

577
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,120
I'm sorry.

578
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,000
I'm sorry.

579
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,840
I'm sorry.

580
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,680
About the Fengbo Tiger case,

581
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,000
I know you have a lot to ask.

582
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,880
You said you fainted after you boarded the ship.

583
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,520
But I saw you holding a weapon

584
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,720
and standing in front of my father.

585
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,360
How do you explain it?

586
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,520
I did faint at that time.

587
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,440
After I woke up,

588
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,760
I saw my master and the other three people

589
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,760
all being sealed.

590
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,160
I wanted to save my master as soon as possible.

591
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,560
But my master was on the pillar of the ship.

592
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,960
I just took off the steel dust on my master.

593
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,520
Then you appeared.

594
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,200
I was poisoned at that time.

595
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,320
I couldn't speak with the horse.

596
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,560
Then I was shot in the back.

597
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,320
I fell into the ship.

598
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,280
The four dead people were indeed hit by the Dragon-slaying Powder.

599
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,280
This made them lose their power to fight back.

600
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,840
As for whether you were poisoned,

601
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,120
only you can say it.

602
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,320
Five people died on the ship.

603
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,800
You can just leave.

604
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,520
It's not any evidence.

605
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,800
Of course.

606
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,360
If you're not the murderer,

607
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,480
then the four people were poisoned.

608
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,480
Who can kill the other person first

609
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,560
and then kill himself after being poisoned?

610
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,600
And you still have a way to live.

611
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,320
This is also where I'm trapped.

612
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,880
Just as you said,

613
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
the murderer can't kill himself

614
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,120
after being poisoned.

615
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,000
But what if there's another possibility?

616
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,560
At that time, there were six people on the ship

617
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,240
except for the five of us.

618
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,240
Impossible.

619
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,280
The Fengbo Lake was surrounded by layers.

620
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,800
I've been watching upstairs.

621
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,120
If someone boarded the ship,

622
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,360
it's impossible not to be found.

623
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,160
What if he's been there all the time?

624
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,560
Three years ago, I was too selfish

625
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,600
and made a conclusion that I was even deceived.

626
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,320
I thought only one person was killed.

627
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,560
For the past three years,

628
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,480
I've been trying to make excuses.

629
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,080
From the few people who were killed,

630
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,040
to the Fengbo Lake,

631
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,760
the death of the person is different.

632
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,200
I've been trying to make excuses.

633
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,640
But I was too selfish.

634
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,720
I was too selfish.

635
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,920
I was too selfish.

636
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,280
I was too selfish.

637
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,400
I was too selfish.

638
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,600
I was too selfish.

639
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,760
I was too selfish.

640
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,000
I was too selfish.

641
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,720
The death of the person is different.

642
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,520
So,

643
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,080
I had an assumption.

644
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,040
If these people were not killed by one person,

645
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,080
the so-called Night Killers

646
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,360
are not one person.

647
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,240
It's very likely that it's a vicious organization

648
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,440
that wants to be a great one.

649
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,960
How can you prove what you said?

650
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,720
I understand.

651
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,560
I can't make you believe it just by lying.

652
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,400
But there is one thing that is not true.

653
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,040
There are many killers in this world.

654
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,160
But there is no such thing as

655
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,560
using the method of long needle sewing and killing.

656
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,520
It's hard to prove it.

657
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,080
If you have been secretly

658
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,280
practicing this kind of evil tricks behind everyone's back,

659
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,360
it's not impossible.

660
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,240
You still don't have solid evidence.

661
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:39,960
Of course.

662
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,320
Let's not talk about whether this person is me or not.

663
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,480
He used the sewing method.

664
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,920
Let's call him a tailor first.

665
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,920
Recently, the three-step sewing method in the capital

666
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,200
is exactly the same as the method of the Fengbo Lake case.

667
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,560
If it's really done by the tailor,

668
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,640
then as long as you catch him,

669
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,840
you can find evidence

670
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,960
to prove that the real murderer of the Fengbo Lake case three years ago

671
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,360
is not me.

672
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,160
If what you said is true,

673
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,520
then why were the bodies of the three cases

674
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,560
burned?

675
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,480
The time of burning

676
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,480
is different from the time of the dead blood clinging to the body.

677
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,080
The front is burned, the back is burned.

678
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,600
Burn is done on purpose to cover up the truth.

679
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,960
If the tailor is real,

680
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,200
why did he burn the body first and then the body?

681
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,000
Isn't it a lot of things?

682
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,800
The tailor didn't burn it.

683
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,280
It's the God's will.

684
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:31,800
Fire mauve.

685
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,560
What above is a sparkler?

686
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:43,880
guess right.

687
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,440
I found this at the crime scene.

688
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,240
You should know what this is

689
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,960
Isn't this the god's fire longer?

690
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,240
Say sorry.

691
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,720
You all continue.

692
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,480
After the case was announced,

693
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,480
the Ministry of Justice lost His Majesty's favor.

694
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,880
Even the case of the Night Fiend was handed over to Lan Zhen Yi.

695
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,880
Now the world is in the line of sewing.

696
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,360
I guess Fang Tianzhen might want to do more,

697
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,200
not less,

698
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,680
to avoid unnecessary trouble.

699
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,680
So he used the dust to cover it.

700
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,480
Even if what you said is true,

701
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,000
the sewing indeed happened.

702
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,480
But it can't prove that the typhoon really exists.

703
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,000
It can't prove that the so-called Night Fiend and Typhoon are not you.

704
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,480
Do you have a map?

705
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,180
Wu Never

706
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,160
West herzlich.

707
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,800
There is no case here.

708
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,840
The dead were intermarried ladies

709
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,640
who had no father and wife.

710
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,160
By sub werden,

711
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,560
you have to carry these lilies

712
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,480
into some remote areas and severe severe tw trendy traffic.

713
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,440
All areWarriors,

714
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,800
with different conditions.

715
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,040
So what do they want to do?

716
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,480
East, South, West, North.

717
00:38:59,480 --> 00:38:59,960
â¦

718
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,080
These four directions

719
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,720
have a special meaning

720
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,080
in the legend of Daqi.

721
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,320
Zhong Buhui,

722
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,920
you are familiar with the folk painting.

723
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,680
Can you think of anything

724
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,080
about these four directions?

725
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,360
The Four Murder Faction.

726
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,400
What is the Four Murder Faction?

727
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,360
The Four Murder Faction.

728
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,400
When the Qi was built,

729
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,200
the previous dynasty was not a traitor.

730
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,760
They set up the Four Murder Faction

731
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,680
around the capital.

732
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,320
It is said that the one who wears the wedding dress

733
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,400
and dies in the formation

734
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,240
will be entangled by the evil spirits

735
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,640
and never be allowed to survive.

736
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,400
The three fengshan cases of the typhoon

737
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,920
are not the three corners of the Four Murder Faction.

738
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,440
That means

739
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,440
there will be the fourth fengshan case.

740
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,960
If there is really the fourth,

741
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,120
it will be...

742
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,680
What time is it now?

743
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,680
It should be past the time of the ugly.

744
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,120
The fengshan case of the capital

745
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,600
is the case of the third day.

746
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,720
And today

747
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,840
is the third day after the third period.

748
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,040
Every time the case is released,

749
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,240
it is after the night.

750
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,640
If the typhoon really kills the people,

751
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,000
then tonight's wedding will

752
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,720
probably take place on the fourth day.

753
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,400
I didn't mean to hear that.

754
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,360
Watch him before I come back.

755
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,720
No one is allowed to go out.

756
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,360
Wait.

757
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,760
No one has ever seen the real appearance of the typhoon.

758
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,040
I don't know how his martial arts are.

759
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,320
Have you ever experienced such a typhoon?

760
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:25,960
So you...

761
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,200
time won't be too quick.

764
