00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:28,760
only

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,580
I'm going to make a

4
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,580
good

00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,580
good

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,580
good

00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,580
good

00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,580

00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,040
go

21
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,520
good

22
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,580
You don't know?

23
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,180
Chu Guang Sha's matter has nothing to do with me.

24
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,780
Since it has nothing to do with you,

25
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,500
why did you run away at night?

26
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,740
I just went down the mountain to enjoy the moon.

27
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,100
Is that a crime?

28
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,140
You're still pretending?

29
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,140
Do you think you can hide the fact that you ride a horse to deliver the order?

30
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,260
At least you can go to the Guang Sha Manor

31
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,140
and save at least an hour.

32
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,260
Where did you go in this hour?

33
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,900
I don't understand what you're talking about.

34
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,780
You're still not going to tell me?

35
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,260
I'll tell you! I'll tell you!

36
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:03,860
I'll tell you!

37
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,380
Where did you go?

38
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,940
I went to eat.

39
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,860
I just ate.

40
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,500
You're still not going to tell me the truth?

41
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,100
You just ate.

42
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,020
Why did you lie to us?

43
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,340
I ate the Star of Marriage.

44
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,620
Our Qingtai Mountain has a strict rule that disciples should cultivate hard.

45
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,300
It's a big deal to eat the Star of Marriage.

46
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,700
But I really can't control my appetite.

47
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,660
I'm afraid that I'll be addicted to my own appetite.

48
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,260
Every time I take the opportunity to deliver the order,

49
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,300
I'll go to the Manor to steal food.

50
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,940
Since you broke the rule, it's no big deal to return the custom.

51
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,140
Why did you choose to run away?

52
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,940
We have strict rules.

53
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,980
If you break the rule,

54
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,860
you'll be punished.

55
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,820
I've broken so many rules.

56
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,580
Even if I hit the board a few times, I'll be killed.

57
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,260
I'm afraid you'll find out the case.

58
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,500
How dare you not run away?

59
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,740
Which Manor did you go to?

60
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,740
Where is it?

61
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,580
It's not far from Qingtai Mountain.

62
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,540
The Manor.

63
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,420
Chu Guang Sha's drug problem

64
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,060
has nothing to do with me.

65
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,500
What I said is true.

66
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,340
I don't believe that the shopkeeper can testify for me.

67
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,700
Come with me.

68
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,220
Say what you just said.

69
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,260
You just went to the Manor?

70
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,740
He doesn't look like he's lying.

71
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,940
And he didn't kill Chu Guang Sha.

72
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,980
If what he said is true,

73
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,140
the Manor is full of people.

74
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,900
The Ninth Fairy is very attentive.

75
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,740
And she's all over the fish.

76
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,380
It's possible that the drug was caught by someone

77
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,580
without being noticed.

78
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,700
I'm getting more and more confused about this case.

79
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,340
Chu Guang Sha and General Huo are friends.

80
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,580
They have this kind of money and money.

81
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,860
They're both dead.

82
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,020
I really don't understand.

83
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,660
Doesn't that mean that the murderer of these two cases

84
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,580
is likely the same person?

85
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,700
You're saying it's Miss Huo again, aren't you?

86
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,700
Impossible.

87
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,700
If the drug was transferred during the delivery process,

88
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,780
Miss Huo would have been with us all the time.

89
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,660
She didn't have time to change it.

90
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,420
This is something I can't figure out.

91
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,700
I can't figure it out either.

92
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,940
Did the ghost master find out?

93
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,940
You went to find the old...

94
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,820
The old man?

95
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,260
I didn't find him.

96
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,900
But I found the ghost master's watchman.

97
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,020
What are you going to do?

98
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,620
Nothing.

99
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,220
I just want to ask you something.

100
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,540
He told me that after the old man left,

101
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,940
he never appeared again.

102
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,420
But I'm Li Qiu's 16th.

103
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,940
I have a lot of ghost ideas.

104
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,620
I found this in his drug store.

105
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,180
Crazy, you're an expert.

106
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,980
Look at this mark.

107
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,260
What do you mean?

108
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,380
This...

109
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,380
This is just a normal print.

110
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,860
That's exactly what I guessed.

111
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,180
Brother, I'll find someone to find this mark.

112
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,340
If there are similar drugs in the capital,

113
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,620
I'll know right away.

114
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,620
Let's go.

115
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,860
Remember to investigate in secret.

116
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,340
Don't alert the police.

117
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,340
Don't worry.

118
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,340
Come on.

119
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,500
I'm doing my best.

120
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,620
You're not taking this?

121
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,340
No need.

122
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,340
It's stuck in my head.

123
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,020
Junior, go check tomorrow

124
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,220
if the ghost master's dress is real.

125
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,220
Feng Xin Zhuo,

126
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,220
let's go find Miss Huo tomorrow.

127
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,220
Miss Huo.

128
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,220
How's your investigation going?

129
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,460
The old master of Qingtan Mountain made the pill

130
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,060
and the last pill Chu Guang Sha took

131
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:50,980
are two different pills.

132
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,980
The problem is on the way to the disaster relief.

133
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,260
I was with you all the time that day.

134
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,980
I didn't have time to change the pills.

135
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,740
Can you clear the suspicion this afternoon?

136
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,420
Of course.

137
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,980
We're both your witnesses.

138
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:07,980
Miss Huo,

139
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,980
do you know the mark on this?

140
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,700
The old master is gone.

141
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,260
You don't have to wait for him to check it.

142
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,860
The tea bag is useless.

143
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,900
You can throw it away.

144
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,100
I remember

145
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,860
the mark on the pill that the old master gave my mother.

146
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,620
The box is still in the warehouse.

147
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:34,980
So

148
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,620
the old master is related to Chu Guang Sha's death.

149
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,580
What's wrong with this account book?

150
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,700
I didn't make the murder case.

151
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,700
But I've sorted out the account book.

152
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,060
It looks like

153
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,460
there's nothing wrong with the account book of Guang Sha Villa.

154
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,300
But Chu Guang Sha's private account book

155
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,580
has a secret.

156
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,580
What secret?

157
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,060
You can go.

158
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,580
Young Master, I've asked around.

159
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,580
Chu Guang Sha was the so-called late-sale monkey.

160
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,820
He suddenly died in front of everyone.

161
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,700
Where's the corpse?

162
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,420
The person from the Divine Service Division took it to the courier.

163
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,740
Where did you get it from?

164
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,740
Qingtai Mountain.

165
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,060
He's not eating outside.

166
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:30,980
He's not eating outside.

167
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,980
This way, please.

168
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,260
You know,

169
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,020
the late-sale monkey can't be rebellious.

170
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,940
The Nine Immortals are afraid of being seen by others.

171
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,220
Every 15th of every month,

172
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,420
he will enter this house from the back door.

173
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,900
The back door is usually not open.

174
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,780
He's sitting here.

175
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,020
I'll prepare his favorite dishes in advance.

176
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,220
After eating...

177
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,980
This way, please.

178
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,860
After eating,

179
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,580
he'll go out from the back door

180
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,980
and ride on the horse I prepared for him in advance.

181
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,780
He's not eating outside.

182
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,780
He's not eating outside.

183
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,780
He's not eating outside.

184
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,780
He's not eating outside.

185
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,540
You've gotta hands on all the details.

186
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,500
Let's go.

187
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,820
Your work is so detailed.

188
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,220
It seems that the Nine Immortals

189
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,340
have given you many benefits.

190
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,620
It's not worth mentioning.

191
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,140
According to what you said,

192
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,100
the Nine Immortals

193
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,260
can't really get in touch with anyone.

194
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,740
Of course.

195
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,260
These contracts and documents

196
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,860
are from the Ministry of War and the Ministry of Works.

197
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,180
In the early years,

198
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,940
the border of Qi was not stable.

199
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,980
There were many battles.

200
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,860
The earliest development of Guang Sha Manor

201
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,300
was to sell iron weapons.

202
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,860
These iron weapons

203
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,580
were sold to the Ministry of War and the Ministry of Works.

204
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,700
Why did the Ministry of War and the Ministry of Works

205
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,780
want iron weapons?

206
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:09,940
They were used as weapons.

207
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,500
General Huo also had the profit in it.

208
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,700
General Huo has been working in the Ministry of War.

209
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,060
And Chu Guang Sha was once

210
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,180
General Huo's subordinate.

211
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,940
He must have something to do with it.

212
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,180
So it's a conspiracy.

213
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,980
The army needs weapons.

214
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,100
As long as this amount of money is fair,

215
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,300
why not?

216
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,940
Then Chu Guang Sha

217
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,940
will not go to the Ministry of War and the Ministry of Works

218
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,980
regularly to collect money.

219
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,380
What's wrong with this account?

220
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,380
Later, the business of Guang Sha Manor

221
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,300
grew bigger and bigger.

222
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,980
The wealth also grew more and more.

223
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,780
But I found that

224
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,420
in addition to the money for the Ministry of War and the Ministry of Works,

225
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,740
Guang Sha Manor

226
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,860
also spent a lot of money to go to Weizhou.

227
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:46,900
Weizhou?

228
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,940
In this account,

229
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,100
I can't tell where they will go to Weizhou

230
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,300
and who will collect money.

231
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,340
Why is it related to Weizhou?

232
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,980
I don't understand either.

233
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,860
Chu Guang Sha spent money on my father

234
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,780
and he can still talk about it.

235
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,020
But such a big sum of money will go to Weizhou.

236
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,940
There is no business deal.

237
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,620
I really can't figure it out.

238
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,380
If we find out the death of Chu Guang Sha,

239
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,540
we may know.

240
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,780
It's the same as the result of my investigation.

241
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,820
The wine master said that

242
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,620
when he was eating,

243
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,980
the pill was in his arms.

244
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,100
He didn't drink and didn't contact other guests.

245
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,340
In such an environment,

246
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,500
it's impossible to change the pill in his arms

247
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,980
without knowing it.

248
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,260
This is so strange.

249
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,300
What should we do?

250
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,020
Let's go.

251
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,500
It's almost time.

252
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,380
Where?

253
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,380
We'll walk the same way.

254
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,180
Even if we want to check,

255
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,860
we don't have to go there in person.

256
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,660
It's a long time.

257
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,380
If we don't go there in person,

258
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,660
how can we find the suspicious point?

259
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:37,580
Let's go.

260
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,620
No, you still suspect Miss Huo?

261
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,620
You're right.

262
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,340
This is the place

263
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,380
where the wine master comes

264
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,220
every time he sends the pill.

265
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,860
He eats in this room.

266
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,300
As he said,

267
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,740
he can't contact anyone.

268
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:02,620
Yes.

269
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,180
There are many people on this road.

270
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,940
Besides, the wine master's pill

271
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,940
has been in his pocket.

272
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,380
Even if he's a thief,

273
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,500
it's impossible to change the pill

274
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,580
from his arms.

275
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,860
So,

276
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,460
it's directory regions

277
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:27,260
which don't have

278
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,420
any sleeping pills.

279
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,500
Me�

280
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,020
What's the secret

281
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,980
in my whole life?

282
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:35,860
MissSL.

283
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,140
It's time.

284
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,020
My lords,

285
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,820
I wonder if there's anything I can help you with.

286
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:42,780
Officer Li,

287
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,820
we want to ask you.

288
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,100
After the pill is delivered,

289
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,020
does Master Chu receive it himself?

290
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:47,660
Yes.

291
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,420
Every time.

292
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,460
There's no exception.

293
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,700
Where does Master Chu go

294
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,660
after receiving it?

295
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,420
The questions that Mr. Zhu asked today,

296
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,540
yesterday,

297
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,460
the central part of the Shenzhen Camp

298
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,980
has been asked.

299
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,060
And

300
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,100
a few days ago,

301
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,140
he also caught a disciple of mine.

302
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:09,820
Old Jia,

303
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,620
tell me what happened

304
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,060
in detail.

305
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,780
Please come in.

306
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,420
The government ordered

307
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,900
that before the case is cleared,

308
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,100
we are not allowed to come in.

309
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,300
So after the owner died,

310
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,620
these doors are locked.

311
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,460
Officer Li,

312
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,700
can I take a look inside?

313
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,740
Please.

314
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,220
Officer Li,

315
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,740
can I open this?

316
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,020
Of course.

317
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,300
In this box,

318
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,420
it should be something

319
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,860
that the master used to worship the gods.

320
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,300
This should be

321
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,980
the box for the elixir.

322
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,460
Yes.

323
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,660
Why are you back?

324
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,660
Miss Huo,

325
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,300
you are...

326
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,420
Since my aunt was buried,

327
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,940
I've been disbanded by all the servants in the family.

328
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,340
The disciples in the family

329
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,780
also went to the camp.

330
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,380
I plan to sell this house

331
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,860
and change it into a smaller one with Qi Ying.

332
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,500
The case is also moving forward?

333
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,220
We came here for this.

334
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,060
But it doesn't matter.

335
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,740
About Chu Guang Sha's death,

336
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,540
we've been mistaken.

337
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,340
We think the elixir was taken away

338
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,260
on the way to Song Dan.

339
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,500
If that's true,

340
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,420
then Miss Huo has no suspicion.

341
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,420
But until I found this box

342
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,940
in Chu Guang Sha's room,

343
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,860
I knew the murderer was the real one.

344
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,940
What's wrong with this box?

345
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,060
Open it.

346
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,780
How come?

347
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,860
Close it and open it again.

348
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,300
This is the mechanical box?

349
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,180
Yes.

350
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,660
The murderer just needs to put the poison in the box

351
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,860
and send it to Mount Qingtai.

352
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,780
After the old gentleman opened it,

353
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,020
he thought it was empty,

354
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,220
so he put the elixir in.

355
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,500
But as soon as the box is closed,

356
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,900
the mechanism will automatically

357
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,300
suck the top layer.

358
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,220
When it's sent to Chu Guang Sha,

359
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,340
Chu Guang Sha can only see the poison in the box.

360
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,900
That means

361
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,340
the elixir was replaced

362
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,620
after the poison was released.

363
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,260
Then go check

364
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,740
which family made this box.

365
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,340
Chu Guang Sha

366
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,820
specially made the jade box.

367
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,580
This is the box

368
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,580
we brought from the store.

369
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,780
I checked it.

370
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,060
It's a very ordinary box.

371
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,580
Since the box is fine,

372
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,060
how did the mechanical box

373
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,100
get to the old gentleman?

374
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:19,860
It's simple.

375
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,780
Just like the principle of the mechanical box,

376
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,980
it's a secret.

377
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,860
Before the elixir is sent out of the furnace,

378
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,940
on the morning of the 15th of every month,

379
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,340
I will send the box

380
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,340
to Mount Qingtai on time.

381
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,940
Where is Mount Qingtai?

382
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,100
Down the mountain.

383
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,860
There will be a gentleman to pick it up.

384
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,700
That box was indeed

385
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,340
sent here on the morning of the 15th of every month.

386
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,300
The boss of the jade shop

387
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,500
sent it down the mountain in person.

388
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,220
But yesterday,

389
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,380
the man who sent the box was a man.

390
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,740
He went up the mountain.

391
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,420
He went up the mountain?

392
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,540
That's right.

393
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,020
As soon as I left the temple,

394
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,500
I met him here.

395
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,780
I was still thinking

396
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,140
he might be a new man.

397
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,300
That's great.

398
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,340
Save my energy.

399
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,260
I understand.

400
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,460
The man who sent the box

401
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,900
was sent down the mountain.

402
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,140
But the man who picked up the box

403
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,980
was at the entrance of Mount Qingtai.

404
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,420
The murderer disguised as

405
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,620
the gentleman of Mount Qingtai

406
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,740
and fooled the boss of the jade shop down the mountain.

407
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,580
He disguised as a man

408
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,620
and sent the box to the gentleman of Mount Qingtai.

409
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,460
He was so smart.

410
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,900
You are really smart.

411
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,900
But even if you know the method of the crime,

412
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,580
you can't find out who the murderer is.

413
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,500
Not necessarily.

414
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,700
You know who the murderer is?

415
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:26,820
Miss Huo,

416
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,620
how long are you going to hide?

417
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,620
Why do you know that?

418
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,420
Now you are calling my name.

419
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,700
Now you have no choice.

420
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,420
You still suspect me?

421
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,180
Zhu Bao.

422
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:57,980
死的那天

423
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,140
我可一直都跟你们在一起

424
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:04,540
That means only the old immortal and you and Chu Guang Sha have touched the elixir.

425
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,940
No, Miss Huo.

426
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,940
I just gave the elixir.

427
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,140
I didn't touch the elixir.

428
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,740
None of us have introduced our names to the Nine Immortal.

429
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,140
But the Nine Immortal took Miss Huo's name out of the mouth.

430
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,140
It means that the people of Mount Qingtai have known you for a long time.

431
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:18,740
So I asked Tong Shuang to investigate the family servants of the Huo family who were dismissed by you.

432
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,940
The people of the Huo family said that since Mrs. Feng was ill,

433
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:26,140
Miss Huo would go to Mount Qingtai every 15th of every month to pray for Mrs. Feng.

434
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,140
Is that true?

435
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,540
If the elixir was really transferred on the way to Song Dan,

436
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,340
Miss Huo would not have had the chance.

437
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:35,140
But if Miss Huo had arrived at Mount Qingtai early in the morning and then rushed back to the Huo Mansion,

438
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,140
and then went to Mount Guang Sha with us,

439
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,540
it would still be enough to finish the task quickly.

440
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,540
This...

441
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,940
The old immortal also said that the elixir of Chu Guang Sha has been with her for a long time.

442
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,940
Miss Huo goes to Mount Qingtai every month.

443
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,740
It's not difficult to understand the process of sending the elixir.

444
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,740
Moreover, no one can compare Miss Huo's disguise.

445
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,340
The old immortal of the disguise factory is good,

446
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,340
and the Nine Immortals are also great.

447
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,740
They are all not under the influence of the painting.

448
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,740
You pretended to investigate the family servants of the Huo family and went to Mount Guang Sha with us.

449
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,740
It's to make us the best time witness for you.

450
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,940
This is all your speculation.

451
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,940
There is no evidence at all.

452
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,940
No, there is evidence.

453
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,340
This elixir helped us a lot.

454
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,940
Do you still remember the immortal who received the box?

455
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,940
Can you recognize it?

456
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,940
No, I can't remember it clearly.

457
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,740
But the immortal who came to receive the box every time is different.

458
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:28,740
I remember that the immortal had a very strong and special scent.

459
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:32,740
Yes, the one who sent the box had a special scent.

460
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,740
It's a very special smell.

461
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,740
So I remember it very clearly.

462
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,740
Is it this smell?

463
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,740
I was still thinking at that time.

464
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,740
The immortal on the mountain should have a fire scent.

465
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,740
How can it be a scent?

466
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,740
Strange.

467
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,740
Do you still remember this smell?

468
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,740
Yes, that's right.

469
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,740
It's this smell.

470
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,740
The boss of the jade qi shop and the immortal on Mount Qingtai are all sure that it is this scent.

471
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,740
Miss Huo, what else do you have to say?

472
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,740
This can be considered evidence.

473
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,740
Why should I kill Chu Guang Sha?

474
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,740
This is a long story.

475
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,740
Maybe it has something to do with the night veil.

476
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,740
Xiao Beiming, are you crazy?

477
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:18,740
You actually forced the night veil's charge on me for the sake of the case.

478
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,740
You are talking too much.

479
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,740
Come back with me.

480
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,740
You don't think about it.

481
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,740
I'm afraid I can't let you.

482
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,740
Qin Yu, he actually knows martial arts.

483
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,740
He is not the girl you know.

484
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,740
What's going on?

485
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,740
It's already happened.

486
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,740
Don't resist anymore.

487
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,740
When did you start to doubt me?

488
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,740
You disguised yourself very well, but still made a few mistakes.

489
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,740
First of all, it was the mother of Feng Yi Niang, a mother who loved her daughter as if she were her own.

490
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:33,740
The most reluctant and most wanted to see her before she died should be her own daughter.

491
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,740
But when she was only left with the last breath, she looked at you.

492
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,740
And entrusted her daughter to you.

493
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,740
Mother.

494
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,740
I'm sorry.

495
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,740
I'm sorry.

496
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,740
I'm sorry.

497
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,740
I'm sorry.

498
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,740
I entrusted her to you.

499
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,740
Mother.

500
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,740
I'm sorry.

501
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,740
I'm sorry.

502
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,740
I'm sorry.

503
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,740
Yes.

504
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,740
The instinct tells me that this is not a simple entrust.

505
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,740
But to ask you for a promise.

506
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,740
Because you have her daughter's life.

507
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,740
There were so many people at the scene.

508
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,740
No one suspected me.

509
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,740
Just a little bit of a flaw.

510
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,740
You found out.

511
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,740
Not only that.

512
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,740
What we just said to Miss Huo is all true.

513
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,740
Except for Miss Huo.

514
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,740
There is another person who goes to Qingtai Mountain every month.

515
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,740
And she uses the same kind of fragrance as Miss Huo.

516
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,740
This person is always by her side.

517
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,740
And it won't cause anyone to suspect the maid.

518
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,740
Miss Huo.

519
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,740
Does the elite also use the blood of the West?

520
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,740
We both have the same cosmetics since we were young.

521
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,740
People are used to their own taste.

522
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,740
But they can't feel the change.

523
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,740
Miss Huo has been working lately.

524
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,740
She's not a fragrance fan at all.

525
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,740
So this person is only possible to be you.

526
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,740
Since you all know.

527
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,740
Then I have nothing to say.

528
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,740
Not good.

529
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,740
Why did you kill Chu Guang and Huo Zong Yao?

530
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,740
Because they deserve to die.

531
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,740
It's because of Haiya.

532
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,740
You are also an orphan of Haiya.

533
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,740
That's right.

534
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,740
Everything is done according to the master's plan.

535
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,740
But Xiao Bei Ming...

536
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:33,740
If you bite your ears, you won't be able to let go easily.

537
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,740
You should continue to follow the plan.

538
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,740
Yes.

539
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,740
And you.

540
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,740
You are the one who killed the master.

541
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,740
You are the one who killed the master.

542
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,740
What happened to Haiya?

543
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,740
You think I will be the soft bone pain like Zhu Yitian?

544
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,740
I won't say anything.

545
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,740
Miss Huo.

546
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,740
Don't be too sad.

547
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,740
Your health is important.

548
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,740
I never thought it would be Qingying.

549
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,740
She has been with me for so long.

550
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,740
Fortunately, you cleared the suspicion.

551
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,740
Isn't it?

552
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,740
Did I say something wrong?

553
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,740
Yes.

554
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,740
I'm sorry.

555
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,740
I'm sorry.

556
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,740
I'm sorry.

557
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,740
Did I say something wrong?

558
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,740
I'm sorry.

559
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,740
How is Shen?

560
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,740
He won't say anything.

561
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,740
That's right.

562
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,740
They are all people who are not afraid of death.

563
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,740
How is he?

564
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,740
Don't worry.

565
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,740
We didn't give him to Shen Buying.

566
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,740
We won't do anything to him.

567
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,740
But it's not a way to go on.

568
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,740
That's why we came to you.

569
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,740
To me?

570
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,740
But I don't know how to interrogate.

571
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,740
No need to understand.

572
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,740
Miss Huo.

573
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,740
Because you know him best.

574
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:32,740
And you may be the one he cares about most.

575
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,740
Tong Bukui.

576
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,740
You go out first.

577
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,740
He won't hurt me.

578
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,740
Let me ask him.

579
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,740
Be careful.

580
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,740
You want to cry again?

581
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,740
I told you before.

582
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,740
Tears are the most useless thing in this world.

583
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,740
You lied to me.

584
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,740
You lied to my mother.

585
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,740
Just to kill my father.

586
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,740
What the hell is going on?

587
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,740
You were sold by Ren Yazi.

588
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,740
At the gate of the brothel, you were beaten to death.

589
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,740
I saved you.

590
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,740
You are a good girl.

591
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,740
You were beaten to death.

592
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,740
I saved you from the bitter sea.

593
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,740
You are my maid.

594
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,740
But my mother and I never treated you as a servant.

595
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,740
I treat you as my sister.

596
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,740
How can you...

597
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,740
Why?

598
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,740
It's not you who saved me.

599
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,740
I let you save me.

600
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,740
I chose you.

601
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,740
Don't hurt me.

602
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,740
Stop talking nonsense.

603
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,740
Let me go.

604
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,740
We are just talking.

605
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,740
Get in there.

606
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,740
Stop it.

607
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,740
What's going on?

608
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,740
What's going on?

609
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,740
What's going on?

610
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,740
What's going on?

611
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,740
What's going on?

612
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,740
What's going on?

613
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,740
Because you are the same as me.

614
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,740
You are all orphans.

615
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,740
Where is the sea?

616
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,740
I was born in Huo's Mansion.

617
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,740
I wanted to find a chance to tell you

618
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,740
your real identity

619
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,740
and let you make the right choice.

620
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,740
Just like me.

621
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:14,740
But I didn't expect

622
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,740
Aunt Feng to be by your side all the time.

623
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,740
She made you so cowardly.

624
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,740
I thought you would be braver

625
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,740
if your parents left you.

626
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:25,740
But I didn't expect

627
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,740
you would be so bold again.

628
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,740
You planned my mother's death.

629
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,740
Yes.

630
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:39,740
I introduced that doctor to Aunt Feng.

631
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,740
That is to say,

632
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,740
I asked him to put the poison powder

633
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,740
into your father's tea.

634
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,740
I also ordered him to confess.

635
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,740
Why would he listen to you?

636
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,740
It's simple.

637
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,740
Just use your life to threaten him.

638
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,740
He can do anything for you.

639
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,740
Even if I let him take the poison that day,

640
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,740
he didn't even frown.

641
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,740
Why on earth

642
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,740
did you do that?

643
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,740
You are inhumane.

644
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,740
I'm not the one who is inhumane.

645
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,740
It's your father, Chu Guang Sha,

646
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,740
and those people from the Cang Feng family.

647
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,740
The evil deeds I did

648
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,740
are not as good as

649
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,740
what those people did to Hai Ya.

650
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,740
I just did what I should do.

651
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,740
I just let them have what they deserve.

652
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,740
What Cang Feng family?

653
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,740
What are you talking about?

654
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,740
Forget it.

655
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,740
These are the things

656
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,740
you should know.

657
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,740
Come in.

658
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,740
You, the great men of Qi,

659
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,740
listen to me.

660
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,740
How hypocritical is your justice

661
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,740
and law?

662
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,740
Mr. Zheng.

663
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,740
I heard that

664
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,740
Zhong Xue Man took someone

665
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,740
to Guang Sha Villa and Qingtai Mountain today.

666
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,740
He is...

667
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,740
He is investigating the murderer

668
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,740
who killed Chu Guang Sha.

669
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,740
It's possible

670
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,740
that he killed General Huo.

671
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,740
Isn't it like killing General Huo

672
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,740
is a crime?

673
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,740
Didn't Zhong Xue Man say

674
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,740
that he committed suicide for the crime?

675
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,740
He didn't say it was Qian Bu.

676
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,740
Then why did he kill him?

677
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,740
It's a crime.

678
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,740
He may not be Qian Bu.

679
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,740
Then we...

680
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,740
I know where to find him.

681
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,740
Come with me.

682
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,740
What is the Three-Wind Armor?

683
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,740
Hai Ya is on the border of Qi.

684
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,740
In 1936,

685
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,740
Qi sent an army

686
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,740
called the Three-Wind Armor

687
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,740
to help Hai Ya.

688
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:03,740
We must win!

689
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,740
But it's unexpected

690
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,740
that the Three-Wind Armor

691
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,740
destroyed the people of Hai Ya

692
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,740
as soon as it reached Hai Ya.

693
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,740
In a few days,

694
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,740
the whole of Hai Ya

695
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,740
was in danger.

696
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,740
The people of Hai Ya

697
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,740
who had no iron

698
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,740
could only be under the knife of the Three-Wind Armor

699
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,740
and beg for mercy.

700
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,740
But they still couldn't escape the cruel fate.

701
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,740
This includes

702
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,740
my parents.

703
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,740
The Three-Wind Armor was destroyed.

704
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,740
How could Qi

705
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,740
do such a thing to the people?

706
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,740
Believe it or not,

707
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,740
if your father and Chu Guang Sha were still alive,

708
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,740
they would never dare to face me in person.

709
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,740
Because they

710
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,740
are all members of the Three-Wind Armor.

711
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,740
In that case,

712
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,740
there must be a reason

713
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,740
for the Three-Wind Armor to be destroyed.

714
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,740
What is it?

715
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,740
I don't know.

716
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,740
I only know

717
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,740
that the Three-Wind Armor did the evil.

718
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,740
The people who tried to kill the late emperor

719
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,740
are the Taoist priests from three years ago.

720
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,740
They are innocent.

721
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,740
No matter what the reason is,

722
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,740
they must die

723
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:20,740
after killing people.

724
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,740
Moreover, that is a city.

725
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,740
So I just need to follow the plan of His Majesty

726
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,740
to let them live.

727
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,740
I don't care about anything else.

728
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,740
His Majesty?

729
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,740
You mean Ye Sha?

730
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,740
Of course.

731
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,740
Zhu Yi Tie said

732
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,740
Ye Sha might have died

733
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,740
three years ago

734
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,740
on the Feng Bo Lake.

735
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:43,740
Who gave you the task

736
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,740
of killing Chu Guang Sha and Huo Zong Yao?

737
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,740
How could His Majesty die?

738
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,740
I'm telling you.

739
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,740
His Majesty is God.

740
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,740
He is the belief

741
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,740
and the light

742
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,740
of all the people of the Ocean.

743
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,740
He will never die.

744
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,740
He will live on

745
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,740
