[The Wanted Detective]

2
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:37,850
[Episode 15]

3
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,560
Xueman.

4
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,620
Thank you.

5
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:10,530
Beiming.

6
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,320
Huo Zongyao and my father

7
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,470
served together.

8
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,590
Was my dad part of the Canfeng Army?

9
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,790
Three years ago, at Fengbo Lake,

10
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,310
what Miao Jie wanted to reveal

11
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,160
must have been about

12
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,820
the Canfeng Army's massacre.

13
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,680
If it's true

14
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,320
that my father was in the Canfeng Army,

15
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,829
then he would also be

16
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:41,430
Yesha's target for revenge.

17
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,520
Then he couldn't possibly be Yesha.

18
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,560
I've never believed

19
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,820
that Master was Yesha,

20
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,520
and I certainly don't believe

21
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,910
he would salughter

22
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:50,610
the defenseless people

23
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,610
of Haiya.

24
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,800
There are many suspicious points

25
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,460
about Canfeng Army and Haiya.

26
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,980
Zhu Yitie said

27
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,320
he never actually saw

28
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,380
Yesha's true face,

29
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,080
but on the boat,

30
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,570
he heard a voice

31
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,120
that sounded like Yesha's.

32
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,660
Now, Qing Ying claimed

33
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,940
that Yesha isn't dead.

34
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,560
Their testimonies

35
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,310
have many contradictions.

36
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,310
Are you doubting

37
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,590
my conclusion that Yesha was on the boat

38
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,910
at Fengbo Lake that year?

39
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,900
I hope I'm wrong too.

40
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,990
That way, Master

41
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,720
would be free of any suspicion.

42
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,579
The deeper we investigate this case,

43
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,280
the more it feels like we're entering

44
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,590
a pitch-black cave.

45
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,230
There's a path ahead,

46
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,520
but the further we go,
the more dangerous it seems,

47
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,180
and the less certain it feels.

48
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,560
No matter how long the night,

49
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,240
the sun

50
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,800
will always rise.

51
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,030
According to Qing Ying's confession.

52
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,080
Yesha ordered her

53
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,360
to first poison Huo Zongyao
through Madam Feng.

54
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,240
Then she switched
Chu Guangsha's immortality pill

55
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,470
and poisoned him too.

56
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:18,870
[Upright and Honest]

57
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,240
Why would Yesha

58
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,920
target these two men?

59
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,040
Qing Ying was just following orders.

60
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,899
She didn't know Yesha's motives.

61
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:25,880
Is that all?

62
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,950
That's all.

63
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,690
Before we could learn more,

64
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,280
Qing Ying took her own life.

65
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,310
Then how did you

66
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,680
find out about Chu Guangsha?

67
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,620
Why were you present

68
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,450
at the scene of his sudden death?

69
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,270
It was because of
the Huo Mansion's account books.

70
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,159
Huo Dairong discovered

71
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:43,430
discrepancies in the accounts

72
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,000
that involved Guangsha Villa,

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,530
so I took some people there.

74
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,000
Unexpectedly,

75
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:48,890
we witnessed

76
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:50,570
Chu Guangsha's sudden death.

77
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,630
At that time, I didn't realize

78
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,590
that Chu Guangsha's death

79
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,040
had any connection to Yesha,

80
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,909
so I didn't promptly

81
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:56,159
report to the Secret Investigation Unit.

82
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,159
What exactly was wrong

83
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,650
with those account books?

84
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:01,600
Chu Guangsha once benefited
from Huo Zongyao.

85
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,880
Over the years, he had been

86
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,430
secretly transferring money
to the Huo Mansion,

87
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,720
all of which can be proven.

88
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,310
If Chief Zhuge requires it,

89
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,970
I can submit the evidence.

90
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,050
My main concern is Yesha, Xiao Beiming.

91
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,210
Besides this,

92
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,800
have you discovered any other

93
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,000
clues about Yesha?

94
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,480
When we get to
the Secret Investigation Unit,

95
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,080
what do you plan to tell them?

96
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,600
I want to tell
the Secret Investigation Unit everything,

97
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,860
so they can help us too.

98
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,020
No.

99
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,720
You can tell them

100
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,980
what they should know,

101
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,870
but what they shouldn't know

102
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,360
must not be revealed.

103
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,600
Why not?

104
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,060
All public records

105
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,320
of Canfeng Army's actions in Haiya

106
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,720
have been erased.

107
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,070
In this world,

108
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,800
only one person

109
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,720
can do this.

110
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,760
You mean...

111
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,530
Massacring an entire city

112
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,240
is such a heinous crime.

113
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,370
If it wasn't covered up,

114
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,870
it would shake the Qi Kingdom to its core.

115
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,950
His intentions

116
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,720
are beyond our understanding,

117
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,040
but if the Zhuge father and son
learned of this,

118
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,770
it could cost them their lives.

119
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,060
That's all.

120
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,540
I've told you

121
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:17,690
everything I know.

122
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,710
Beiming, food's ready.

123
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,010
Beiming.

124
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,750
Beiming, food's ready.

125
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,120
Beiming!

126
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,580
Beiming!

127
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,610
Beiming.

128
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,380
My needle technique is useless

129
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,120
to him now.

130
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,750
We must find the Fire Cicada,

131
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,600
or Beiming won't survive.

132
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,800
How long can he last?

133
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,220
Maybe three days.

134
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,630
Maybe five days.

135
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,040
Maybe

136
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,450
tomorrow...

137
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,510
Where are you going?

138
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,440
To find someone.

139
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,250
Feng,

140
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,800
is there anything else

141
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,000
we can do for Beiming?

142
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,430
For a city-wide manhunt,

143
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,510
even Chief Fang

144
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,860
needs official documents
from the Ministry of Justice

145
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,560
to proceed.

146
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,040
This person is extremely important to me.

147
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,480
I must find him as soon as possible.

148
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,310
Yes, I...

149
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,830
I can help you unofficially,

150
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,310
right?

151
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,640
The others can help too,

152
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,680
but this kind of thing

153
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,950
goes against protocol.

154
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,810
If the Ministry of Justice finds out,

155
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,120
the Elite Constabulary Unit
will be in serious trouble.

156
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,950
Jiang Yi,

157
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,090
I'm begging you this time.

158
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,720
I...

159
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:21,920
I...

160
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,870
Who is this person?

161
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,780
You don't know.

162
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,270
You don't even know

163
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,360
what crime he's committed.

164
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,300
Xueman,

165
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,750
I can't help you.

166
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:34,960
I...

167
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:36,960
I'm sorry.

168
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,510
It happened so quickly!

169
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,740
I swept my leg

170
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,090
and tripped that thief.

171
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:52,800
Who knew

172
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,550
there was another one
hiding behind to ambush me?

173
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,410
That's how I got injured.

174
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,230
Easy, easy.

175
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,160
Where did this medicine come from?

176
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:21,110
[Fuxing Pharmacy]

177
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,080
You came indeed.

178
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,960
How did you know I was coming?

179
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,720
I lured you here on purpose.

180
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,710
Otherwise,

181
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,390
would I be stupid enough to sell medicine

182
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,320
to a constable
from the Elite Constabulary Unit?

183
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,120
You knew I was looking for you,

184
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,850
yet you still lured me here.

185
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,820
Aren't you afraid I'll arrest you?

186
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,830
Put down what you're holding.

187
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,100
If I were afraid,

188
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,960
I wouldn't have done this.

189
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,990
What exactly are you trying to do?

190
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,370
I want to make a deal with you.

191
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,510
A deal?

192
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,630
What kind of deal?

193
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,840
He's dying, isn't he?

194
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,000
Who's dying?

195
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,270
You may fool others,

196
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,400
but you can't fool me.

197
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,490
You know who I'm talking about.

198
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,440
No one knows the look of

199
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,600
someone approaching death
better than I do.

200
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,000
That day at the Ghost Market,

201
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,210
I only glimpsed him from afar,

202
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,330
but I knew his days were numbered.

203
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,380
If I'm not mistaken,

204
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,860
he was likely afflicted by
a type of frost toxin.

205
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,750
The fact that he's survived until now

206
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,590
is already a miracle.

207
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,320
What else do you know?

208
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,600
You came to the Ghost Market that day
looking for me

209
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,550
because you wanted
the Fire Cicada I possess

210
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,550
to detoxify him.

211
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,120
I'm right, aren't I?

212
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,390
Since you want to make a deal,

213
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,120
state your terms.

214
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,120
I remember telling you

215
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,520
about my rules.

216
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,910
If you want my eyes,

217
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,820
then take them.

218
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,100
You're such a straightforward girl.

219
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,770
I quite like that about you.

220
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,930
But such a pretty face

221
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,430
without eyes...

222
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,050
I'd really hate to see that happen.

223
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,820
What exactly do you want?

224
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,860
I want the Little White Dragon.

225
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,000
Who is the Little White Dragon?

226
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,200
It seems that guy

227
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,180
hasn't told you

228
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,600
his true identity.

229
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,320
Constable Zhong.

230
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,480
How is Beiming doing?

231
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,660
Beiming is still unconscious.

232
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,030
Constable Zhong.

233
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,360
I know

234
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,570
you're still worried about Beiming.

235
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:39,910
You did your best.

236
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,720
If it weren't for my mistake,

237
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,060
Beiming wouldn't be

238
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,350
in this condition now.

239
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,980
After all we've been through together,

240
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,000
there's no need

241
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,190
to separate you and me,

242
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,390
or who's right and who's wrong.

243
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,050
None of that matters anymore.

244
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,630
Constable Zhong.

245
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,490
No matter what it takes,

246
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,360
I will heal Beiming.

247
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,550
Trust me.

248
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,440
Coroner Feng.

249
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,440
There's something I've been

250
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,500
wanting to ask you.

251
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,120
Go ahead.

252
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,420
Do you really not know

253
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,320
the old man we me

254
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,740
tat the Ghost Market that day?

255
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,510
I don't know him.

256
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,080
Why are you suddenly asking?

257
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:33,750
It's nothing.

258
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,640
It's just that I don't think
I've ever heard you

259
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,320
talk about your childhood.

260
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,030
I was just a farm boy.

261
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,110
When I was young, I met

262
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,140
a traveling doctor from the martial world

263
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,600
who taught me some skills.

264
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,020
There's nothing much to tell.

265
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,100
Poison Valley is
the evilest sect in the world.

266
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,260
They've committed countless crimes

267
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,220
and are unforgivable.

268
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,910
This so-called Coroner Feng

269
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:03,040
is actually the Little White Dragon
from Poison Valley.

270
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,070
Poison Valley?

271
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,800
Little White Dragon?

272
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,850
How many lives he has taken

273
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,910
is something only he knows.

274
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,490
That's impossible.

275
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,380
Coroner Feng

276
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,860
isn't that kind of person.

277
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,700
Don't tell me you think

278
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,760
the personal disciple
of the Poison Valley Chief

279
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,630
is some kind of saint who wouldn't even

280
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,890
dare to kill a chicken?

281
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,050
It's all an act

282
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,690
to deceive you all.

283
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,470
He is ambitious and killed his master

284
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,290
to steal Poison Valley's sacred

285
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,330
Yin-Yang Book.

286
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,510
I'm looking for him

287
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,030
to avenge my senior.

288
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,760
You consider him a friend,

289
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,710
but who knows

290
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:46,710
what he wants to trade

291
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,710
your lives for?

292
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,230
I see you still don't believe me.

293
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,550
That's fine.

294
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,550
Just bring him to me

295
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,480
and I'll confront him face to face.

296
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:00,930
The truth will come out naturally.

297
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,360
Think about it carefully.

298
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,650
Is the person you want to save
more important

299
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:11,770
or someone full of lies

300
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,790
who might harm you all

301
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,640
at any moment?

302
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,040
Constable Zhong.

303
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,080
Constable Zhong.

304
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,510
You seem a bit off today.

305
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,590
It's nothing.

306
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,890
Beiming is seriously ill,

307
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,280
so I'm not in a good mood.

308
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,390
I just wanted someone to talk to.

309
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:34,790
Don't worry.

310
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,610
Even if it costs me my life,
I will save him.

311
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,400
Coroner Feng.

312
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,900
Miss Huo?

313
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,250
Miss Huo, what...

314
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,400
What are you doing here?

315
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,240
Qing Ying is dead.

316
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,160
I'm the only one left

317
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,510
in the vast Huo Mansion.

318
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,400
I really couldn't bear to stay there.

319
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,280
I wanted to chat with

320
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:41,710
Beiming and Xueman,

321
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,950
but I couldn't find them.

322
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,710
They've gone to bed.

323
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,540
You've been drinking?

324
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,080
Something's troubling you?

325
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,610
No... not really.

326
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,000
Let me walk with you.

327
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:08,270
Medical texts all say
that emotional distress

328
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,130
can only be relieved

329
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,290
by following one's feelings.

330
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,950
Coroner Feng.

331
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,140
If you trust me,

332
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:17,349
perhaps

333
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,150
you could share your troubles with me.

334
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,040
Miss Huo,

335
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:22,240
what is a friend?

336
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,619
Why do you ask?

337
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,520
If you

338
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,500
deceived your friends,

339
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,650
would they still want to
be your friends?

340
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,390
Would they blame you?

341
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,020
Relationships

342
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,200
are built on trust.

343
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,440
And even more on honesty.

344
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,070
If you deliberately deceive someone,

345
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,330
that's unacceptable.

346
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:47,880
At the very least,

347
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,660
I wouldn't be friends

348
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,150
with someone full of lies.

349
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,050
But there are exceptions.

350
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,150
What exceptions?

351
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,590
If there's no intention to harm

352
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,220
or a selfish motive,

353
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,390
what's wrong with a white lie?

354
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,400
Who has never

355
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,150
told a few lies in life?

356
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,240
It's like me and Beiming,

357
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,530
and Constable Zhong.

358
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,960
They once suspected me,

359
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,160
causing me a lot of trouble.

360
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,960
I've also deceived them,

361
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,110
causing them many problems.

362
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,280
Now, everything is over.

363
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,890
The case of my parents

364
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,390
has been solved.

365
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,440
I actually hope to become

366
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,500
friends with them.

367
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,250
A gentleman judges by actions,
not intentions.

368
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,480
To understand someone,

369
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,680
look at their everyday words and deeds.

370
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,110
True friends

371
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,240
don't care about

372
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,570
what you did in the past.

373
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,090
They only look forward.

374
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:47,960
Really?

375
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,920
Of course.

376
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,990
Isn't that what you've done?

377
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,000
Me?

378
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:54,390
You're willing to stay by Beiming's side

379
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,150
and haven't

380
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,390
feared or avoided him because he is

381
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,390
Qi Kingdom's most wanted criminal.

382
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,960
Isn't it because,

383
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:00,960
deep down, you believe

384
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,240
in his character

385
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,970
and believe he's not Yesha?

386
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,110
That's why

387
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,390
you fight to clear his name

388
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,720
and worry about his safety.

389
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,110
Why do you still have doubts

390
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,180
about something
you've already accomplished?

391
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,750
Judging by your expression,

392
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,670
have your doubts been resolved?

393
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:25,680
Thank you,

394
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,590
Miss Huo.

395
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,700
Is the person you want to save
more important

396
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,790
or someone full of lies

397
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,850
who could harm you all

398
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:40,670
at any moment?

399
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,520
Think about it carefully.

400
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,200
Have you made up your mind?

401
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,420
As long as it can save his life,

402
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,080
I'll do whatever you ask.

403
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,790
I can give you the person,

404
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,880
but what about the Fire Cicada?

405
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,680
Hand him to me

406
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,040
and I'll give you the Fire Cicada.

407
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,960
Where is he?

408
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,040
It's not safe here.

409
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,950
I've locked him up

410
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,310
somewhere in the suburbs.

411
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,520
I can take you there,

412
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,110
but let me be clear.

413
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,310
If you try any tricks,

414
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:20,270
I will hunt you down
to the ends of the earth.

415
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,200
Lead the way.

416
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,110
He's here.

417
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,950
Where is the Fire Cicada?

418
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,240
I'll take him with me.

419
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,000
We won't be meeting again.

420
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,240
I'll go find Constable Zhong right away.

421
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,040
Coroner Feng.

422
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,070
Constable Zhong?

423
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,440
Constable Zhong,

424
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm sorry.

425
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,350
I've been lying to you all along.

426
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,690
I actually have another identity.

427
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,270
I am Little White Dragon.

428
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,760
I'm sorry.

429
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,040
I'm sorry,

430
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,720
I've been deceiving you all this time.

431
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,250
I already know everything.

432
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,760
Old Bug told me.

433
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,150
You met Old Bug?

434
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:01,550
What did he say?

435
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,210
He said

436
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,770
you killed your master

437
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,310
and stole the Yin-Yang Book.

438
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,040
No,

439
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,050
that's impossible.

440
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,920
I couldn't have killed my master.

441
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,160
I didn't steal the Yin-Yang Book.

442
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,590
I know!

443
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,770
I didn't steal the Yin-Yang Book!

444
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:15,570
I believe you

445
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,120
aren't that kind of person.

446
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,760
I've been looking for a chance all day

447
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,820
to say these words.

448
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,660
You're willing to believe me?

449
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,150
Seeing isn't always believing,

450
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,920
and hearing is even less reliable.

451
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,630
Exactly.

452
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,040
Old Bug was trying to drive us apart.

453
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,280
But he doesn't know

454
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,070
what we've been through together.

455
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,350
If you were a bad person,

456
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,050
Beiming and I

457
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:40,040
would have died countless times by now.

458
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,550
But I...

459
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,240
How could I let his words

460
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:42,850
make me...

461
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,480
But I'm from Poison Valley.

462
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
Does that matter?

463
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,480
Thank you.

464
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,900
Thank you.

465
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,490
Old Bug approached you

466
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,110
just to sow discord?

467
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:11,760
No.

468
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,470
He wants me to use

469
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:17,000
Coroner Feng to exchange for
the Fire Cicada.

470
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,900
Don't worry, I won't do that.

471
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,840
I'll think of a solution myself

472
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,070
for the Fire Cicada.

473
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,080
Constable Zhong,

474
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,980
use my life for the exchange.

475
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:29,790
Coroner Feng!

476
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:30,520
No way.

477
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,770
What kind of person do you think I am?

478
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:32,700
Listen to me.

479
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,010
What I mean is,

480
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,510
I have a plan.

481
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,550
So this is where you've been
hiding all along?

482
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,010
Fengbo Lake is over there.

483
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,030
It's the place that changed

484
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,830
Beiming's fate three years ago.

485
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,870
Not just his, but mine too,

486
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,720
and that of many others,

487
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,940
including yours.

488
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,590
Indeed,

489
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,520
no one would think of this place.

490
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,600
Beiming is safe here.

491
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,010
Since you brought me here,

492
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,080
does that mean

493
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,690
you completely trust me now?

494
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,520
Actually, there's another purpose

495
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,720
in bringing you here.

496
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,870
He's unconscious and can't speak now,

497
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,400
so I'll speak on his behalf.

498
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,570
About what?

499
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,390
We misunderstood you before.

500
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,330
We apologize to you.

501
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,520
You little girl,

502
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,240
going back on your word!

503
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,860
How dare you be so dishonorable,

504
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:40,300
stabbing me in the back!

505
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,830
Respected elder,

506
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,920
I'm the one who stabbed you in the back.

507
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,790
Please don't misunderstand dear Zhong.

508
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,480
She'll hand me over;
you'll hand over the item.

509
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,790
She handed me over,

510
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:49,850
but you couldn't take me away.

511
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:50,540
That's your own incompetence.

512
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,740
How is that her fault?

513
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,470
Twisting words, shameless,

514
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:58,120
cruel-hearted, lowly,

515
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,200
conspiring together, venomous!

516
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,040
Enough.

517
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,260
Just keep that little bit

518
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,790
of vocabulary to yourself.

519
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,140
You already have the Fire Cicada.

520
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,870
What more do you want?

521
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:08,960
Let's keep matters separate.

522
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,830
The business between us
isn't finished yet.

523
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:11,630
Avenging your Master,

524
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:13,360
that old fool?

525
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,880
Do you have what it takes?

526
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,440
How dare you mention it?

527
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,040
Your enemy is standing right before you,
yet you can't kill him.

528
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,700
You worthless piece of trash.

529
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,150
I wish I could kill you right now.

530
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,390
But I'm no longer

531
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:33,550
the Little White Dragon of Poison Valley.

532
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:36,000
I am Feng Qingzhuo
of the Elite Constabulary Unit.

533
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,880
We will definitely

534
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,680
get to the bottom of your crimes,

535
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,720
take you back
to the Elite Constabulary Unit,

536
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,600
and make you face justice.

537
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:44,960
We're running out of time.

538
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,320
We need to quickly bring
the Fire Cicada back

539
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,450
for Beiming to take.

540
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,360
What are you laughing about?

541
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,250
I'm laughing at your Master,

542
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,550
that old fool,

543
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,240
for having such poor judgment

544
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,110
in choosing disciples.

545
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,390
You fool.

546
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:02,050
I'm laughing at you
for sending him to his death,

547
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,290
instead of saving him.

548
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:05,760
What do you mean?

549
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,200
Fire Cicadas can indeed

550
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,000
counteract cold-based toxins.

551
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,920
But using poison to fight poison

552
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,720
requires the toxins not to conflict.

553
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,960
The Fire Cicada's poison is so potent

554
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,550
that if he takes it directly,

555
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:19,390
the hot and cold toxins
will battle inside him.

556
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,550
Forget about detoxification.

557
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,680
He'll die instantly.

558
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,920
You fool.

559
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,070
How should the Fire Cicada be used then?

560
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,890
You must use special herbs

561
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,080
to process the Fire Cicada.

562
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,040
Only then will it slowly release

563
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,030
its warming poison to dispel the cold,

564
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,870
gradually wearing away the frost toxin.

565
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,240
This is

566
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,450
the correct detoxification method.

567
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,880
Do you know
how to process the Fire Cicada?

568
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,020
Coroner Feng?

569
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:49,010
Do you know how to process it?

570
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,090
The method of processing Fire Cicadas

571
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:53,280
is known only to me in this world.

572
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,560
This idiot

573
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,750
wouldn't know.

574
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,230
Is what he's saying true?

575
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,790
He's right.

576
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,520
Old sir,

577
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,040
if you're willing to save Beiming,

578
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,760
I'll trade my life for his.

579
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,970
But I can't give you Feng Qingzhuo.

580
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,170
Take my life and do

581
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,270
whatever you want with me.

582
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,470
I'm at your disposal.

583
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,280
Xueman, no!

584
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,690
What do you say?

585
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,920
Why would I want your life?

586
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,930
It's completely useless to me.

587
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,310
Actually, Little White Dragon's life

588
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,920
is useless to me too.

589
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,860
This whole time,

590
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,140
I only want...

591
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,070
the Yin-Yang Book.

592
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,720
If you give me the Yin-Yang Book,

593
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:42,930
I can help you

594
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,360
process the Fire Cicada.

595
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,720
We can't give you the Yin-Yang Book.

596
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,840
Then he can just wait to die.

597
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,140
If you don't teach us

598
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,280
how to process the Fire Cicada,

599
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,680
you'll die immediately.

600
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,110
Young lady,

601
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,390
if you kill me,

602
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,590
then

603
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,960
there will be no one left to save him.

604
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,890
Old Bug was trying to drive us apart.

605
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,910
But he doesn't know

606
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,830
what we've been through together.

607
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,200
If you were a bad person,

608
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,180
Beiming and I

609
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,790
would have died countless times already.

610
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,380
How could I doubt a friend I trust

611
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,040
because of something he said?

612
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,480
But I'm from Poison Valley.

613
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:35,870
Does that matter?

614
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,790
[Yin-Yang Book]

615
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,320
For this method,

616
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,630
be mindful of the dosage.

617
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,920
Aren't you going to tell them

618
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,280
about your identity?

619
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,080
Someone from Poison Valley

620
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,320
can't possibly be a good person.

621
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,840
Aren't you a good person?

622
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:28,340
[Yin-Yang Book]

623
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,020
I'll give it to you.

624
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,500
[Yin-Yang Book]

625
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,370
But this is your Master's memento.

626
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:38,540
[Yin-Yang Book]

627
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,390
Books are dead objects.

628
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,650
If I disregard my friend's life

629
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,790
because of a book,

630
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,280
then I, Feng Qingzhuo,

631
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,080
am not worthy of being a doctor.

632
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,550
Exchanging a book for my friend's life

633
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,100
is worth it.

634
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,710
Give me the Yin-Yang Book.

635
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:06,690
I can immediately

636
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:07,790
prepare the Fire Cicada for you.

637
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:08,810
I can do it!

638
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,730
Give it to me.

639
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,720
G-Give it to me.

640
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:12,830
Hurry!

641
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:17,190
[Yin-Yang Book]

642
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,170
Give it to me.

643
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,500
What are you doing?

644
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:19,550
Are you crazy?

645
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,040
I...

646
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:33,110
I know exactly
what kind of person you are.

647
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,750
I'll give you half first.

648
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,200
After you successfully detoxify him,

649
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,950
I'll give you the other half.

650
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,280
Give me that.

651
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:06,990
Are you dumb?

652
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,550
Right.

653
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,000
It should be fine.

654
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,000
Although Old Bug
has done many evil things,

655
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,680
he is skillful in making medicine.

656
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,040
I watched him the whole time.

657
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,440
He didn't try any tricks.

658
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,920
Besides this antidote,

659
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,470
you have no other options.

660
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,200
Why not let him try it?

661
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,810
Master.

662
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,480
Were you in the Canfeng Army?

663
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,790
Am I an orphan from Haiya?

664
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:38,550
What exactly happened

665
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:39,550
at Fengbo Lake back then?

666
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:40,350
Who is Yesha?

667
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,250
Master,

668
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,720
I don't have much time left.

669
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,960
Please speak, Master,

670
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,590
Master!

671
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:45,680
-Master!
-Actually,

672
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,350
every Haiya survivor is Yesha.

673
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,440
As long as there's one survivor

674
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,310
still breathing,

675
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:49,940
Yesha

676
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,310
will keep coming back,

677
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:53,590
-including you, Xiao Beiming.
-Master is a god.

678
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:54,730
He is the faith and light

679
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,630
for all Haiya survivors.

680
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,960
He will never die.

681
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,790
He will lead us

682
00:32:58,790 --> 00:32:59,960
to live on

683
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,200
until the Qi Kingdom

684
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,680
pays the price it deserves.

685
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,650
Until we avenge

686
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,020
all the people of Haiya!

687
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,200
Beiming.

688
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:16,810
Beiming.

689
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:17,590
Beiming.

690
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,110
Beiming, Beiming!

691
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,390
Beiming.

692
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,690
Take it easy.

693
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,740
How are you feeling, Beiming?

694
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,610
I don't feel as cold anymore.

695
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:32,920
Feng,

696
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,920
you're so smart!

697
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,020
That's wonderful!

698
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,110
You developed an antidote?

699
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,110
It wasn't me.

700
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,630
It was him.

701
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,240
Seems we have quite a connection.

702
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,830
Sir, thank you for your trouble.

703
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,080
But you're now involved in

704
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:51,920
a very important case.

705
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,360
Until the case is solved,

706
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:56,010
I'm afraid we'll have to
inconvenience you.

707
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,110
You promised

708
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,200
to let me go after I cured your poison.

709
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,440
Now the poison is gone,

710
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,920
but you're going back on your word.

711
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,000
You people

712
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,570
have absolutely no honor.

713
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:07,870
Forget it.

714
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,719
I won't hold it against you.

715
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,550
Speak.

716
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,340
What case is it?

717
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,710
The Yesha case.

718
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,710
Yesha?

719
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,590
Aren't you Yesha?

720
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,210
Everyone in the world

721
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:20,840
knows

722
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,790
that you, Xiao Beiming, are Yesha.

723
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,400
And you have the nerve to ask me?

724
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,750
What a joke.

725
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:26,679
Sir,

726
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,960
if this is how our conversation will go,

727
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,190
I'm afraid you won't be leaving so easily.

728
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,630
Beiming has already found
plenty of evidence

729
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,320
connecting you to Yesha.

730
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,780
You'd better come clean

731
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,980
and tell us everything,

732
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,540
unless you want to suffer.

733
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,300
Even if you have evidence,

734
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,360
what can you do to me?

735
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,350
Turn me over to the authorities?

736
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,800
Then I'll just keep accusing Xiao Beiming.

737
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,710
Or does anyone here have the guts

738
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,210
to kill me right now?

739
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,920
We won't kill you.

740
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,840
We have our own methods.

741
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,650
What do you have in mind?

742
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,800
Old Bug's reputation

743
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:06,190
is notorious throughout the martial world.

744
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,300
You must know clearly

745
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,310
how many victims

746
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,840
and enemies you have.

747
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,400
All we need to do is spread word

748
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,360
of your whereabouts,

749
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,000
and within two days,
you'll be dead for sure,

750
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,920
and it won't be a pretty death.

751
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:18,190
-You're shameless!
-My master taught me

752
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:18,850
to treat people

753
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:19,750
the way they deserve to be treated.

754
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,570
Your master wouldn't think of

755
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:21,870
such underhanded tactics.

756
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,650
You've learned bad habits from them.

757
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:24,650
Cut the nonsense.

758
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,000
Don't you want the Yin-Yang Book?

759
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,790
As long as you tell us

760
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:27,590
about Yesha,

761
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:28,730
I'll not only guarantee

762
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:29,960
your temporary safety,

763
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,440
but I'll also give you

764
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,520
the other half of the Yin-Yang Book.

765
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:41,400
Fine,

766
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,040
I'll tell you,

767
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:45,350
but I'll only tell you alone.

768
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:51,230
Alright.

769
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,750
Feng,

770
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,590
being alone with him

771
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,590
is too dangerous.

772
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,320
Don't worry.

773
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:59,840
He can't do anything to me.

774
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,150
But you don't know martial arts.

775
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,520
Isn't he tied up?

776
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,230
We've searched him thoroughly.

777
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,830
-Don't worry.
-Tong Shuang.

778
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,550
listen to Feng Qingzhuo.

779
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,640
Beiming.

780
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:14,880
Come.

781
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:23,670
We've prepared plenty of food.

782
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,290
These past few days,

783
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:25,470
we've all been so worried
about your condition

784
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,800
that we haven't eaten properly.

785
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,320
Please sit down and eat something.

786
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,450
Thank you, Miss Huo.

787
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,320
I actually intended

788
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,320
to visit you again,

789
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,920
but I unexpectedly fell ill.

790
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,100
Constable Zhong

791
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,530
already told me what you wanted to say.

792
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,230
It's all in the past.

793
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,430
Don't worry about it.

794
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,580
Where's Coroner Feng?

795
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,360
Old Bug wanted to have
a private chat with him.

796
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,040
This...

797
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:51,960
Don't worry,

798
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,310
nothing will happen.

799
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,380
I'll go up and check on them again.

800
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,120
Don't worry, it's fine.

801
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,970
What you most want to know

802
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,230
is probably how your Master

803
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,670
died.

804
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,040
You killed him.

805
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:20,000
You lost to my master

806
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,320
in the Valley Chief Competition

807
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,550
and were poisoned.

808
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,000
My master not only spared your life

809
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,190
but also saved you.

810
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,070
You repaid kindness with betrayal.

811
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,520
You murdered my master

812
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,070
for that Yin-Yang Book.

813
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:30,520
You think

814
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,580
I killed him

815
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,270
for the Yin-Yang Book?

816
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:33,440
Isn't that true?

817
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,590
In Poison Valley,

818
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,800
it's always been our tradition

819
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,840
for disciples to test poisons
on each other.

820
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,350
Whoever dies from another's poison

821
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,770
simply lacks skill.

822
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,860
Only you and your master

823
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,170
are hypocrites pretending to be saints,

824
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,000
learning only antidote methods.

825
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,040
Since your master became Valley Chief,

826
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,150
he banned disciples
from poisoning each other.

827
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,550
If this continued,

828
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:53,750
Poison Valley would be filled with

829
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:54,840
weaklings like you

830
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,960
and your master.

831
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:56,850
Then how could Poison Valley

832
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:59,040
still strike fear in the martial world?

833
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,190
My master's kindness

834
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,920
became your reason to kill him?

835
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,960
Calling you a fool

836
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,930
isn't unfair at all.

837
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,960
Cut the nonsense.

838
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:07,840
Tell me,

839
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,920
how did you kill him with poison?

840
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,200
The ice-heart grass.

841
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,000
The ice-heart grass?

842
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,320
Even I can cure
the ice-heart grass's poison!

843
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,580
How could my Master possibly die from it?

844
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,270
It's ironic.

845
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,900
You're now a coroner,

846
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
but back then,

847
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:26,230
you couldn't bear to perform

848
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:28,070
an autopsy on your own master.

849
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,630
You'd been with your master
since you were old enough to remember.

850
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,710
Since you were young,

851
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,480
I'd poisoned him countless times,

852
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,010
but when did I ever harm him?

853
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,860
Giving him the ice-heart grass

854
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,230
was no different
than the usual matches

855
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,590
we'd always had.

856
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,630
But I never expected

857
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,160
that he would actually die.

858
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,520
You're lying!

859
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,670
You never think carefully

860
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,750
with your brain.

861
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,040
If I had possessed the kind of poison

862
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,360
that could kill him,

863
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:55,840
how could I have possibly

864
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,630
lost the Valley Chief position to him?
