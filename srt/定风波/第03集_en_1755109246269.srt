00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,090
How treacherous his intentions are!

187
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,080
Great! Great! Great!

188
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,510
Then this junior

189
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,320
is really pitiful.

190
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:22,840
Yeah.

191
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,750
Not only was she tricked
into getting married,

192
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:28,080
but she also witnessed
her biological father being killed.

193
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,090
Have a grape.

194
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,080
You're still so hot-tempered.

195
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,270
Just say it.

196
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,080
I don't like the person

197
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,910

198
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,510
Wait.

199
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,760
I do have something to tell you.

200
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,400
It's about Xiao Beiming.

201
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,080
As you know,

202
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,630
after the Fengbo Lake case

203
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,910
three years ago,

204
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,960
the Elite Constabulary Unit is no longer
what it was before,

205
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,120
completely falling out of favor

206
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,440
with His Majesty.

207
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,200
The Secret Investigation Unit
is in charge of

208
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,150
every important and major case.

209
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,920
Especially your senior...

210
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,720
The Yesha case.

211
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,010
What on earth are you trying to say?

212
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,460
I want to work with you.

213
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,240
Work with me?

214
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:22,630
Over the past three years,

215
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,000
many murders following Yesha's method

216
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,840
have occurred.

217
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:26,870
At all the crime scenes,

218
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,670
his name was left.

219
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,120
Every time a case occurred,

220
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,750
you conducted an investigation.

221
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,910
But in the end?

222
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,630
They just imitated him

223
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,150
to frame him.

224
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,030
It's been three years.

225
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,440
Yucheng, Kuizhou,

226
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,080
East Sea, and West Wastelands.

227
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,510
You've been to so many places

228
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,790
and solved so many cases,

229
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,320
but you've still failed to find him.

230
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:44,960
Am I right?

231
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,030
Why don't you consider working with me?

232
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,430
We can find him together.

233
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,030
No need.

234
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,390
In this world,

235
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,960
besides you,

236
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,440
I want to find him more than anyone else.

237
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,480
Now you have proved

238
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,000
your ability to investigate a case
and hunt for a murderer.

239
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,550
And we have the same goal.

240
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,790
If we work together

241
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,960
and share information,

242
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,750
we will find him

243
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,720
in time.

244
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,870
I told you I don't need it.

245
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,130
What else do you want to say?

246
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,380
I've always wanted to ask you.

247
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,950
You don't think

248
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,120
Xiao Beiming

249
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,850
is the murder of the Fengbo Lake case,
right?

250
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,640
I only believe in evidence.

251
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:29,310
Fengbo Lake was tightly surrounded
that day.

252
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,480
At the crime scene,

253
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,550
no one else

254
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,640
could get a chance to get on the boat
to commit murder.

255
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,790
Per the coroner's exam results,

256
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:35,750
the people on the boat
were all poisoned by knockout drops.

257
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,470
Then, they were sewn and murdered

258
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,950
while in a coma.

259
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:39,930
However, Xiao Beiming

260
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,480
was the only sober person.

261
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,160
He escaped

262
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,750
right under the crowd's noses.

263
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,400
We have solid evidence.

264
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,920
We both know his talent.

265
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,960
If he's not Yesha,

266
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,920
why did he run away?

267
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,510
If he is really wronged,

268
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,550
over the past three years,

269
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,830
why hasn't he shown up

270
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,030
and proved his innocence?

271
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,630
That's why I need to find him.

272
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,350
I must uncover the truth

273
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,550
from back then.

274
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,200
If you really catch him,

275
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,110
and if he admits it,

276
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,310
what will you do?

277
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,090
I will kill him myself.

00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,680

281

Long time no see.

282
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,960
Xiao Beiming, you finally showed yourself.

283
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,480
I didn't kill Master.

284
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,460
I gave you

285
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,810
the clue you got.

286
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:32,400
I know

287
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,860
you would find this place.

288
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,310
For the past three years,

289
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,480
I've been tracking leads

290
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,640
on Yesha.

291
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,240
Xueman,

292
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,550
if you're willing to believe me,

293
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,070
I will prove to you personally that

294
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,750
what happened on the boat

295
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,960
at Fengbo Lake three years ago

296
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,400
is never my doing.

297
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,640
Why should I trust you?

298
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,160
Don't move.

299
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,310
If you move again,

300
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,640
I'll kill you right now.

301
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,250
I'll show you the evidence.

302
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,590
You also found these pinholes

303
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,270
come from three crime scenes.

304
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,170
The victims are three brides.

305
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,240
But they weren't burnt

306
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,590
but rather

307
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,200
sewn to death.

308
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,240
These pinholes

309
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,970
are exactly the same as

310
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:40,070
those on the boat at Fengbo Lake
three years ago.

311
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,110
It means

312
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,070
Yesha has reappeared.

313
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,600
You showed up right when the sewing murder
happened.

314
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,880
Doesn't that just mean

315
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,960
you are Yesha?

316
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,270
Master's tunnel

317
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,160
is a good place to hide.

318
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,110
If you

319
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,510
don't make it clear,

320
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,350
this place can be your grave.

321
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,920
I spared your life

322
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:21,870

323
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:22,830
to know what on earth happened

324
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,230
at Fengbo Lake back then.

325
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,310
My dad treated you like his own son.

00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,550
Why did you do that?

327
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,000
If you dare to lie,

328
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,730
I'll kill you immediately.

I can only tell you,

00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,350
not long after I got on the boat,

331
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,270

that I'm not Yesha.

00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,830
Any official documents
from the Elite Constabulary Unit?

375
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:57,160
We need to report it
if you need any poison.

376
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,200
It concerns a felon.

377
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,900
We don't want to alert him.

378
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,960
After it's done,

379
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,960
I will report it to the unit myself.

380
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,510
You don't believe me?

381
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:12,030
You saved my life, Constable Zhong.

382
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,440
I'll do anything for you.

383
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,200
It's okay.

384
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,110
Just help me keep it a secret.

385
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,440
These are the precious poisons
I've stored.

386
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,790
This poison is called Cracking Pill.

387
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,680
Take it,

388
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,830
and one's skin will crack
and bleed nonstop.

389
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,680
Without an antidote,

390
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,340
he or she will die in half a day.

391
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,640
This one is called Heart-piercing Arrow.

392
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,920
It will attack the heart directly

393
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,920
with no visible wounds left.

394
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,510
Take it, one's heart will race like crazy,

395
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,270
and he will die

396
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,980
in an hour if there's no antidote.

397
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,640
I'm not trying to kill anyone.

398
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,380
Is there any medicine that can

399
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,110
seal someone's internal energy

400
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,400
and martial arts skills, depriving

401
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,440
him of his strength

402
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,920
to make him even unable to stand up?

403
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,750
Yes.

404
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,680
This one!

405
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,720
This is called Paralysis Pill.

406
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,270
Even a cow will be paralyzed

407
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,790
after taking it.

408
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,000
If you feed it to a man,

409
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,400
even the top martial artist

410
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,110
will be as weak

411
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,240
as a baby for half a month.

412
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:00,960
Even someone like me

413
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,310
can beat him up.

414
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,570
Then I'll take this.

415
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,640
My decoction h-has dried up!

416
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,440
Take it.

417
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,750
Thank you.

418
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,400
Constable Zhong!

419
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,770
Feel free to come again!

420
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,350
I've finally got a chance

421
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,160
to repay her help.

422
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,510
My decoction h-has dried up!

423
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,310
Take it.

424
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,310
Oh no.

425
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,270
Use the medicine
to deprive me of my internal energy

426
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,920
and prevent me from fleeing away.

427
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,590
And it'll make the interrogation easier.

428
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:57,590
Cut the crap.

429
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,880
You keep saying you're innocent.

430
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,160
What?

431
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,500
Afraid I'll kill you with poison?

432
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,410
You don't have to go through

433
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,310
all this trouble if you want to kill me.

434
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,790
I chose to show up today,

435
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,310
and I never thought of running away.

436
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,680
Cut it out.

437
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,680
If you are wronged,

438
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:19,360
why have you been hiding
for three whole years

439
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,790
until another sewing murder case
occurred in the capital?

440
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,990
You appeared at the scene immediately!

441
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:29,070
Because he's disappeared
for three years as well.

442
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,880
Were it not for
another sewing murder case in the capital,

443
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,880
I would have kept lurking in the dark

444
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,310
and continued to investigate it

445
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,480
just like the way you looked for me

446
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,030
before catching him.

447
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,200
I showed up at the crime scene today

448
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,250
because I was betting my life.

449
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,160
On what?

450
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,750
On a person.

451
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,400
Even if everyone
in the Qi Kingdom believes

452
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,270
I am Yesha,

453
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,150
there's still one person

454
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,920
who will definitely

455
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,320
suspect it and get
to the bottom of it for me.

456
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,720
Because no one

457
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,120
knows me better than her.

458
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,680
I met her today

459
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,750
because I was betting on her suspicion.

460
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,720
If she really thought

461
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,310
I killed her father,

462
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,200
when we met today,

463
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,400
her Bi'an Sword

464
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,910
should have pierced my heart

465
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,920
instead of my shoulder.

466
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:34,510
I'm not asking you

467
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,000
to completely forgive me.

468
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,030
But I hope you can

469
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,880
keep this trace of suspicion

470
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,730
and let me stay by your side

471
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,780
to investigate the case with you.

472
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:44,720
I promise you

473
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,780
I won't let him get away with it again.

474
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,960
I will fetch you the truth

475
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,640
submerged in the Fengbo Lake
three years ago

476
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,270
with my own hands.

477
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,350
Constable Zhong.

478
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:18,830
Constable Zhong.

479
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,920
Constable Zhong.

480
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,550
C-Constable Zhong.

481
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,680
Constable Zhong!

482
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,720
Coroner Feng, what's wrong?

483
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,770
Constable Zhong!

484
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:29,900
The medicine!

485
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:30,880
I gave you the wrong one!

486
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,680
Did you take it?

487
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,080
Did you feed it to others?

488
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,830
What happened?

489
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,640
It's all my fault.

490
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,310
I gave you the bottle

491
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,640
without taking a close look.

492
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,920
You didn't take the Paralysis Pill,

493
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,830
but the Blood-freezing Frost.

494
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:52,920
What is it?

495
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,800
A deadly

496
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,350
and extremely rare poison.

497
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,440
How could you mix it up

498
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,440
with a deadly poison?

499
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,040
I'm sorry.

500
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:01,070
But it's not the time to blame me.

501
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,590
Let me give him some acupuncture.

502
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,520
Maybe there's a chance to save him.

503
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,700
Constable Zhong,

504
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,030
I'll give him acupuncture treatment.

505
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,890
Can you leave us alone for a while?

506
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,750
Why did he kill my father?

507
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,160
He killed several officers,

508
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,960
including your father,

509
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,550
just to stir up rumors

510
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:55,920
and spread fear.

511
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,960
The case about the statue's
tears of blood was done in secret.

512
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,720
But the Fengbo Lake case is different.

513
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,750
Don't forget that

514
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,790
it was my wedding day.

515
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,070
We were surrounded by our men.

516
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,070
Even if he made it,

517
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,640
he'd have been spotted.

518
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:09,600
My father

519
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,030
and the others were already in a coma

520
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,050
because of the knockout drops.

521
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:13,850
It was as easy as pie to kill them.

522
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,550
Why did he have to

523
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,550
choose the cruelest sewing murder?

524
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,270
The sewing murder technique

525
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:22,000
is not something
that can be mastered overnight.

526
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,680
I had spent more than ten years with him.

527
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,750
If he really were

528
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,920
a crazy murderer

529
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,690
who managed to hide it from me,

530
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,620
could he have deceived my dad?

531
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,400
Even if everyone in the Qi Kingdom

532
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,790
believes I am Yesha,

533
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,710
there's still one person

534
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,590
who will definitely

535
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,990
suspect it and get
to the bottom of it for me.

536
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,160
Constable Zhong!

537
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,000
How is he now?

538
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,790
Though I've used acupuncture on him,

539
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,310
the frost toxin

540
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,150
has already infiltrated into his body.

541
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:52,000
Blood-freezing Frost
is a slow-acting poison.

542
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,080
It will gradually seep

543
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,810
into his organs and meridians.

544
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,270
You mean there's no way to cure him.

545
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,110
Not really.

546
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,690
I've held the poison at bay.

547
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,200
He still has some time

548
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,830
before the next outbreak.

549
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,550
But as for how many days he can survive—

550
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,720
several months or several years—

551
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,180
it all depends on himself.

552
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,960
If we can find the antidote,

553
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,590
maybe

554
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,200
there's still a chance to save him.

555
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,800
You don't have the antidote?

556
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,640
This poison is extremely thorny.

557
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,240
All these years,

558
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,480
I've been working on the antidote.

559
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,110
But

560
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,790
no progress so far.

561
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:25,960
But don't worry.

562
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:28,000
The felon has lost all his martial arts

563
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,200
and internal energy.

564
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,640
Constable Zhong,

565
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,310
sorry for getting you into trouble.

566
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,030
Despite his identity as a felon,

567
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:37,110
I caused you to use the wrong poison.

568
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:38,350
I will go back with you

569
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,750
to explain it to the unit.

570
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,680
Be it imprisonment or punishment,

571
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,070
I won't implicate you.

572
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,300
[Wanted]

573
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,200
A fugitive?

574
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,590
He is Yesha, Xiao Beiming?

575
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,790
He is Yesha?

576
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:59,270
Good gracious!

577
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,150
It's okay, Constable Zhong.

578
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,640
Thank God we deprived him

579
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,700
of his martial arts

580
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,060
and internal energy!

581
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,160
Constable Zhong,

582
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,400
this is a great merit!

583
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,510
You caught Yesha!

584
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,030
And I made him...

585
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:09,640
Shut up!

586
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,510
Don't worry.

587
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,160
You won't die for now.

588
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:36,790
Thanks.

589
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,590
No, no.

590
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,960
I'm still not sure

591
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,600
if it's a merit or a mistake.

592
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Constable Zhong,

593
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,970
about the Fengbo Lake case,

594
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,680
I know

595
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,540
you still have a lot of questions.

596
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:10,790
You said you fainted

597
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:12,450
soon after boarding the ship.

598
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,790
But I saw you holding a weapon

599
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:14,660
in front of my father

600
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,860
with my own eyes.

601
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,530
How do you explain that?

602
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:19,640
I did black out.

603
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,550
And then I woke up

604
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:23,880
to the scene where the Master
and the other three

605
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,400
were all sewn and murdered.

606
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,070
The first thing I did

607
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,530
was try to save the Master.

608
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:28,400
But the Master was sewn

609
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,930
onto the corner of the ship.

610
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:30,800
When I just pulled

611
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,330
the steel needle out of him,

612
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,630
you showed up.

613
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,430
I was poisoned back then.

614
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,890
My tongue was numb, and I couldn't speak.

615
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,670
Then I was shot by an arrow

616
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,560
and fell off the boat.

617
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,800
The four victims

618
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,550
were indeed hit with knockout drops,

619
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,110
leaving them

620
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,570
no strength to fight back.

621
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,760
As for whether you were poisoned,

622
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,360
that's just your statement.

623
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:51,440
Five people on the ship.

624
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,400
Four died.

625
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,200
You can make up a story as you please.

626
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,000
It can't be counted as evidence.

627
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:56,840
Of course.

628
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,530
If you didn't murder them,

629
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,920
with the four of them being drugged,

630
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,630
who could sew and kill the others

631
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,480
and himself

632
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,550
in that state,

633
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,670
letting you survive?

634
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,420
This is also what confuses me.

635
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,880
As you said,

636
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:10,880
there's no way

637
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,190
the murderer sewn and killed

638
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,110
the others and himself

639
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,230
after being drugged.

640
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:14,630
But what if

641
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,360
there is another possibility?

642
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,110
What if there was

643
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,670
a sixth man on the ship

644
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:21,320
besides the five of us?

645
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,360
Impossible.

646
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:25,370
Fengbo Lake was heavily guarded.

647
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,070
I was watching from upstairs
the whole time.

648
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,230
Anyone who tried to board the ship

649
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,630
would surely be spotted.

650
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,560
What if he was there the whole time?

651
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,230
I was too cocky three years ago.

652
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,150
I made an inference

653
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,550
that even misled myself.

654
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,190
I thought there was only one Yesha.

655
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,650
Over the past three years,

656
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,400
I've never stopped deducing.

657
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,280
From the murders of several ministers

658
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,800
to the Fengbo Lake case,

659
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:01,450
the victims died in different ways.

660
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:02,230
So,

661
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,920
I came up with an assumption.

662
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,360
If these people

663
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,880
were not killed by the same guy,

664
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,800
then the so-called Yesha

665
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,190
should be more than one person.

666
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,190
Yesha might be

667
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:13,520
an evil group scheming for something big.

668
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,670
How can you prove it?

669
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,590
I understand that

670
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,280
I can't win your trust

671
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,360
just with some deductions.

672
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,150
But one thing's for sure.

673
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,880
There are countless killers in this world,

674
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,150
but a lunatic who's skilled
in killing by sewing

675
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,610
should be one in a million.

676
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,880
Ordinary people can hardly do that.

677
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,670
Or maybe you

678
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:32,760
had been practicing

679
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,150
this evil technique

680
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,710
behind everyone's back.

681
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,280
You still have no solid evidence.

682
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,000
Of course.

683
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,550
Let's not talk about whether

684
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:40,610
this evil man is me.

685
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,510
He is good at sewing murder,

686
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,910
so let's call him Tailor.

687
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,920
The recent three
sewing murder cases in the capital

688
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,280
are exactly the same in method

689
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,140
as the Fengbo Lake case back then.

690
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,630
If they were all done by Tailor,

691
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,670
as long as we catch him,

692
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:52,880
we'll get the evidence

693
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,630
to prove that

694
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,000
I'm not the culprit

695
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,730
of the Fengbo Lake case.

696
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:00,400
If you're telling the truth,

697
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,400
why were

698
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,670
the bodies in the three cases

699
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,670
all burned?

700
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,590
The burning

701
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,590
and the victims' blood coagulation

702
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,880
didn't happen at the same time.

703
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,190
They were sewn and killed first,
and then burned.

704
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,280
Someone burned their bodies

705
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,550
to cover up the truth

706
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,630
deliberately.

707
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,110
If Tailor really exists,

708
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,710
why did he sew and kill them first,
and then burn the bodies?

709
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,230
Wasn't that unnecessary?

710
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,050
Tailor didn't burn the bodies.

711
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,280
It was the Elite Constabulary Unit.

712
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,480
Let's go.

713
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,550
I found this

714
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,920
at the crime scene.

715
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,630
You know what this is.

716
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:49,360
Isn't it
the Elite Constabulary Unit's igniter?

717
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:50,470
Sorry.

718
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,110
You two go on.

719
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,030
It's Fang Tianzheng.

720
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:57,840
Exactly.

721
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,510
Since the Fengbo Lake case,

722
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,480
the Elite Constabulary Unit

723
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,760
has lost His Majesty's favor.

724
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,710
Even the Yesha case has been handed

725
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:03,920
over to the Secret Investigation Unit.

726
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,800
Now the sewing murders occurred again.

727
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,480
I guess

728
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,710
Fang Tianzheng wants to

729
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,150
cover it up to avoid

730
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,710
unnecessary trouble

731
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,710
by burning the corpses.

732
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,630
Even if what you said is true,

733
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,400
as the sewing murders did happen,

734
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,230
it still can't prove

735
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,400
the existence of Tailor.

736
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,210
Neither can it prove

737
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:21,400
that you're not the so-called
Yesha and Tailor.

738
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,600
Do you have a map here?

739
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,400
Western suburbs.

740
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,000
No case has occurred there.

741
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,800
The victims

742
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,710
are all weak,

743
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,770
female newlyweds.

744
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,040
Tailor brought these brides

745
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,400
to such a remote place,

746
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:45,630
sewn and killed them.

747
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,550
It was meticulously arranged

748
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,810
for a special purpose.

749
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:52,190
Then what do they want?

750
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:54,760
East,

751

These four directions

Constable Zhong,

758
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,600
you are familiar with folk novels.

759
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:08,840
Do these four directions

760
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,170
remind you of anything?

764
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,810
What is the Four Devils Formation?

765
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:28,890
When the Qi Kingdom was founded,

766
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,760
the former dynasty didn't give up.

767
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,190
They set up the Four Devils Formation
around the capital.

768
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,400
Word has it that those who died

769
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,070
in the formation in wedding clothes

770
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,320
will be haunted by devils forever

771
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,980
and never go to the afterlife.

If there's really going
to be the fourth one,
