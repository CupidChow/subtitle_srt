00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,830
[Episode 26]

3
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:48,120
You're awake?

4
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,900
You scared us to death.

5
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:52,840
Dairong.

6
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,670
Where's Beiming?

7
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:58,039
He's been taken
by the Elite Constabulary Unit again.

8
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,190
Take it easy.

9
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,060
You're still very weak.

10
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,140
I need to find him.

11
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,090
Constable Zhong,

12
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,220
where are you going?

13
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,080
I need to find Beiming.

14
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,400
I'm afraid that's not possible right now.

15
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,360
What do you mean?

16
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,870
Chief Fang has given orders

17
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,670
that no one is allowed to see him.

18
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,710
Why?

19
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,360
Huang Wuchang

20
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,910
died at the worst possible time.

21
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,120
With Huang Wuchang dead,

22
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,920
Beiming's suspicion

23
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,240
is even harder to clear now.

24
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,590
And that old bastard Zhuge

25
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,120
keeps watching
the Elite Constabulary Unit,

26
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,000
saying he'll report
to the Ministry of Justice

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,190
to co-investigate Beiming.

28
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,870
Chief Fang has no choice in this matter.

29
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,150
Huang Wuchang is dead,

30
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,110
but before he died,

31
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,280
didn't he say Yesha was at Haiya?

32
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,470
You all heard it.

33
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,710
Isn't that proof

34
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,520
that Beiming isn't Yesha?

35
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,280
You're right,

36
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,360
but at that time,

37
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,800
only the few of us heard it.

38
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,510
Our relationship with Beiming

39
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,970
is well known to everyone,

40
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,460
so we can't be witnesses.

41
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,650
I still need to find Chief Fang

42
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,480
and explain everything clearly.

43
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,600
-Constable Zhong.
-Xueman.

44
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,570
Finding Chief Fang now

45
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:54,950
won't solve the problem.

46
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,480
Let's think of another way.

47
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,390
-Beiming.
-Beiming.

48
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,510
Beiming!

49
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,130
It's all right.

50
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,640
Weren't you arrested
by the Elite Constabulary Unit

51
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,040
and not allowed to leave?

52
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,240
How come you're here?

53
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,230
I escaped.

54
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,550
Escaped?

55
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:49,740
W-What?

56
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,990
Beiming, are you crazy?

57
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,640
What happened?

58
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,990
Someone helped me.

59
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,829
Yesha is at Haiya?

60
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,270
That's what Huang Wuchang told you

61
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,160
before he died?

62
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,600
I never expected

63
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,320
Huang Wuchang

64
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,180
would take his own life like that.

65
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,040
Now that he's dead,

66
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,440
things are even more complicated.

67
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,300
Now, Zhuge Tong

68
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,200
is pushing for a joint trial
with the Ministry of Justice.

69
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,860
I've tried my best to delay it,

70
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,000
but there's no one now

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,640
who can clear your name.

72
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,120
Once convicted,

73
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:22,390
you'll be beyond salvation.

74
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:23,880
I understand.

75
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,960
What do you mean?

76
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,320
I'm letting you go.

77
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,590
I've already sent everyone else away.

78
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,560
Letting me go?

79
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,290
If there's anyone in this world

80
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,680
who can stop Yesha,

81
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,409
I'm afraid you're the only one.

82
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,440
-But the whole capital...
-Do you remember

83
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,240
how you tricked Yesha

84
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,220
with Shen Bi's fake death?

85
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,030
I'll use the same method.

86
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,510
I'll find a death row prisoner
to replace you.

87
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,800
But that's too risky.

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,080
He'll be exposed immediately
during questioning.

89
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,880
I'll report to the Ministry of Justice

90
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,350
that you've contracted a plague

91
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,910
and no one can come near you.

92
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,440
Those people

93
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,120
value their lives too much

94
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,200
to take such a risk.

95
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,910
However,

96
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,880
this plan won't work for long.

97
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,120
I can only give you

98
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,950
half a month at most.

99
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,510
If you catch Yesha

100
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,030
within half a month,

101
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,430
everything will be fine.

102
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,120
This is too dangerous.

103
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,909
If they discover
you've released a key criminal,

104
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:35,120
you won't just be dismissed
and investigated.

105
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,590
You'll be executed.

106
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,270
Someone has to

107
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,440
do something, right?

108
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:54,760
Xiao Beiming,

109
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,590
I've noticed you're
very much like your Master

110
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,320
when he was young.

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,660
You're equally intelligent.

112
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,030
But you both let your emotions

113
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,160
get the better of you

114
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,830
and act recklessly,

115
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,000
often making

116
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,200
foolish decisions.

117
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,120
He once told me

118
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,120
that right and wrong
are more important than life and death.

119
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,950
I disagreed.

120
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,200
Because of this,

121
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,710
we often argued.

122
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,590
Now that I'm older,

123
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,540
I've actually started

124
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,340
to understand him more and more.

125
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,200
I even envy him somewhat.

126
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,360
I've been a coward my whole life.

127
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:32,880
Trusting you

128
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,680
is the most daring decision

129
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,150
I've ever made.

130
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,310
The feeling is quite addictive.

131
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:46,470
Even if I lose this gamble,

132
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,060
when I meet your master in the afterlife,

133
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,260
I'll still be able to stand tall

134
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:52,950
and tell him

135
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,590
that I,

136
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,570
Fang Tianzheng,

137
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,200
have lived up to the title of Chief

138
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,390
of the Elite Constabulary Unit.

139
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,270
I never thought

140
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,120
Chief Fang would do something like this.

141
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,560
I knew

142
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,750
I wasn't wrong about Chief Fang.

143
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,640
Since he's so loyal,

144
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,640
if he's in trouble,

145
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,270
I can risk my life for him once.

146
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,090
Just once?

147
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,870
Just once.

148
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,170
Right now,

149
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,270
besides Chief Fang,

150
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,070
there are many people behind us.

151
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,140
We will definitely defeat Yesha.

152
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,530
How's the situation outside?

153
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,830
Huang Wuchang's body

154
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,080
was taken by
the Secret Investigation Unit.

155
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,630
What about those
remaining Yellow Heaven members?

156
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,470
They've been arrested.

157
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,140
They're still being interrogated.

158
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,160
Scarface's wife and daughter

159
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,080
have been rescued,

160
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,470
which proves

161
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,630
that Scarface was coerced.

162
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,990
What about the pill? How is it?

163
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:49,630
The pill?

164
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:50,990
The pill was destroyed

165
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:51,800
and ruined.

166
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,160
Huang Wuchang used thunder gold
to make the pill,

167
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,800
and Old Bug's body

168
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,680
also contained thunder gold.

169
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,680
I suspect

170
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,320
the pill Old Bug took

171
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,320
and the one Huang Wuchang made

172
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,320
are the same type.

173
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,680
If that's the case,

174
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,800
then the thunder gold in Old Bug's body

175
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,520
must have come from

176
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,980
the pill he took at the end.

177
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,110
I still need to examine

178
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,470
Old Bug's body myself.

179
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,110
The Secret Investigation Unit
still has his body.

180
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,990
That's easy.

181
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,200
I'll figure something out.

182
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,990
Eat more.

183
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,920
If that half-blind Zhuge knew

184
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,830
that we've been treating

185
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,200
the Secret Investigation Unit
like our own home,

186
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,350
coming and going as we please,

187
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,350
his one good eye

188
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,040
would probably go blind with anger.

189
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,830
If you ask me,

190
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,800
now that Zhuge Kongyun

191
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,680
has been released,

192
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,870
we shouldn't

193
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,110
go through all the trouble

194
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,630
of sneaking in anymore.

195
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,630
Have him

196
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:37,410
take us inside.

197
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,940
Huh? What are you thinking?

198
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,230
Even if Zhuge Kongyun

199
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,200
is willing to help us,

200
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,870
what if Beiming gets discovered entering

201
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:43,950
the Secret Investigation Unit?

202
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,110
What about the Elite Constabulary Unit?

203
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,280
The body needs to be examined.

204
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,680
Just not at the Secret Investigation Unit.

205
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,590
Beiming, what do you mean?

206
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,440
I don't understand.

207
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,160
Tong Shuang,

208
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:51,800
after we finish eating,

209
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,870
prepare a carriage for me.

210
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,470
All right.

211
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,470
Miss Huo,

212
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,280
after dinner, please help me

213
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,350
tell Zhuge Kongyun,

214
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,080
"That place."

215
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,110
That place?

216
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,350
I'll take you there later.

217
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:00,990
Let's eat.

218
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,030
Is this the place you mentioned?

219
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,560
You've been meeting

220
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,350
with Zhuge Kongyun here all along?

221
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,470
Before the Fengbo Lake case,

222
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,750
I used to come occasionally.

223
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,990
Looks like he's already here.

224
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:15,800
Who's this?

225
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,230
Didn't you say that Zhuge Kongyun

226
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,440
once handled a case where

227
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,710
he used the victim as bait

228
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:20,970
to lure out the killer?

229
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,750
Later, the victim was so frightened

230
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,200
that she developed hysteria,

231
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,560
and tragically drowned

232
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,920
during an episode.

233
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,800
Her mother was so devastated

234
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,880
that she cried until she went blind.

235
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,470
Is this the victim's mother?

236
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,180
All these years,

237
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,460
Zhuge Kongyun has been

238
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,520
taking care of her.

239
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:40,520
I got it.

240
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,560
I'm almost done.

241
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,380
When did you find out about this?

242
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,520
I discovered it

243
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,070
by chance a long time ago.

244
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:49,040
You know how peculiar

245
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,350
Zhuge Kongyun's temper is.

246
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,680
He absolutely forbade me
from telling anyone.

247
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,320
Have some water too, Mrs. Lin.

248
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,230
Let me fan you.

249
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,350
Is that better?

250
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,280
Thank you.

251
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,350
Fan yourself instead.

252
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:57,710
I'm fine.

253
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,440
Mrs. Lin!

254
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,730
That voice sounds like
Beiming has arrived.

255
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:04,830
Beiming!

256
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,960
I've come to see you.

257
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,230
Oh, Beiming.

258
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:07,990
Mrs. Lin.

259
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,350
Beiming.

260
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,040
Mrs. Lin,

261
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,710
how have you been?

262
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,040
Good, I'm doing well.

263
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,280
I've asked Kongyun many times,

264
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,080
but he always tells me

265
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,690
that you're out catching criminals.

266
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,160
I haven't seen you for so long.

267
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,920
I've been so worried.

268
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,460
You must've been through a lot

269
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,470
out there all these years.

270
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,390
It's nothing,

271
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,390
Mrs. Lin. I'm doing fine.

272
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:35,950
Now that I'm back,

273
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,210
I'm here to stay.

274
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,200
Good,

275
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,870
good.

276
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,520
By the way,

277
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,990
you two must have things to talk about.

278
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,630
I'm a bit tired,

279
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,440
so I'll go rest in my room.

280
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,080
Mrs. Lin.

281
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,750
How about

282
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,280
I accompany you?

283
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,710
Who's this stranger?

284
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,590
Zhong Xueman.

285
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,440
The one you know about.

286
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,590
Really?

287
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:01,710
Miss Zhong,

288
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,560
Beiming's wife?

289
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,750
Beiming told me

290
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,120
that once he married you

291
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,510
and brought you home,

292
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,350
he would bring you to see me.

293
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,350
And just like that,

294
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,990
three years have passed.

295
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,280
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lin.

296
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,320
But I brought her to see you

297
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,080
as soon as I returned
to the capital, didn't I?

298
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,160
Miss Zhong,

299
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:22,870
come.

300
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,920
Please come inside.

301
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:25,990
Let's go.

302
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,630
That's nice.

303
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,130
Watch your step.

304
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,790
I can't believe Fang Tianzheng

305
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,250
actually released you.

306
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,230
Chief Fang may be cautious,

307
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,520
but he's a man of integrity.

308
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,320
Thanks

309
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:50,050
for not telling Mrs. Lin
about my situation.

310
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,190
If I had known...

311
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,400
If I'd known, I would've
arrested you myself

312
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,320
and told her

313
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,260
you died in the line of duty.

314
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,680
Miss Zhong.

315
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,560
Those two always mention you.

316
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,160
They haven't said

317
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,090
anything nice about me, have they?

318
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,870
They speak very highly of you.

319
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,750
By the way,

320
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,830
you've been married for so long.

321
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,320
Haven't you thought about having a child?

322
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,090
He's always busy with official duties.

323
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,520
You people

324
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,560
are different from us

325
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,520
common folk.

326
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,080
Your hearts

327
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,440
are always filled with grand matters.

328
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,800
If it's not justice and fairness,

329
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,730
then it's the people of Qi Kingdom.

330
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,630
But then again,

331
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,110
how can all evil

332
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,870
possibly be eliminated?

333
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,700
How can all the bad people

334
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,080
possibly be caught?

335
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,920
Sometimes,

336
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:00,200
you even forget

337
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,030
that you're nothing more

338
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,160
than children after all.

339
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,080
Don't put all those burdens

340
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,320
on your own shoulders.

341
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,840
And don't wait until someday

342
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:16,230
when you've lost something and regret it

343
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,680
to realize

344
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,710
that the people around you

345
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,280
are the most precious.

346
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,200
If I were to

347
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,440
arrest you right now,

348
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:33,520
would the Elite Constabulary Unit

349
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,160
be completely done for?

350
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:38,680
This is indeed

351
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,740
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

352
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,230
Mr. Zhuge,

353
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,610
you're welcome to try.

354
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,110
Your sarcasm

355
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,650
is truly irritating.

356
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,780
You need my help?

357
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,830
Yes.

358
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,160
Old Bug's body?

359
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,880
Not just that.

360
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,750
Fang Tianzheng

361
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,920
took the risk to free you.

362
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,200
This means you told him

363
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,520
quite a lot.

364
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,160
But I'm not Fang Tianzheng.

365
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,860
Tell me what you know.

366
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,280
Let's see if you can

367
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,940
convince me not to arrest you.

368
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,920
Beiming is fortunate

369
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,550
to have met you.

370
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,040
This boy

371
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,590
is like cotton wrapped in iron.

372
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,470
He looks tough on the outside,

373
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,990
but his heart

374
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,110
is too soft.

375
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,950
As they say, what's too rigid
breaks easily.

376
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,470
If he can't hold on anymore

377
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,760
and the iron breaks,

378
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,750
that little bit of cotton

379
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,350
will scatter away.

380
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,040
Miss Zhong,

381
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:56,110
you must take good care of him.

382
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:58,110
Don't let him be too stubborn.

383
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,130
Don't worry, Mrs. Lin.

384
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,560
I'll look after him.

385
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,180
Are you saying

386
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,260
Yesha wants to use

387
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,720
the pill that Huang Wuchang
and Old Bug created

388
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,360
to do something?

389
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,680
That's why we need to

390
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,710
examine Old Bug's body quickly

391
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,080
to confirm my theory.

392
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,470
But the clues from Haiya
are also important.

393
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,350
There are no records

394
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,470
of the soldiers who served

395
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,130
in the Canfeng Army back then.

396
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,230
Huo Zongyao's case

397
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,920
left behind many clues

398
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,350
because he once held

399
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,470
an important position in the military.

400
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,560
This indicates that someone

401
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,000
in the court
is connected to the Canfeng Army.

402
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,630
That's right,

403
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,160
and that's why I came to you.

404
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,280
You want me to help you find out

405
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,110
if there's anyone else who knows about

406
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,280
the Haiya clues?

407
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,920
With my current status,

408
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,510
investigating would be very difficult,

409
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,830
with obstacles everywhere.

410
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,360
After much consideration,

411
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,280
I believe you're the most suitable person.

412
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:01,670
I can help you.

413
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:03,900
However,

414
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,490
I've saved you so many times

415
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:07,829
Do you plan on

416
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,630
continuing to owe me this favor?

417
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,630
Mr. Zhuge,

418
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,910
what do you want?

419
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,490
The day we catch Yesha

420
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,349
and your name is cleared,

421
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,109
I want you to hold my horse

422
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,670
and announce to the world

423
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,310
that I, Zhuge Kongyun,

424
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,990
am better than you, Xiao Beiming.

425
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:27,319
I am the greatest detective in Qi Kingdom.

426
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,040
Agreed?

427
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,240
Mr. Zhuge,

428
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,440
without your help these past years,

429
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,670
I wouldn't have made it this far.

430
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:38,120
The title of greatest detective
in Qi Kingdom

431
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,830
has long been rightfully yours.

432
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:40,880
Cut the flattery.

433
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,350
I'm asking if you agree or not?

434
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,080
Fine.

435
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,630
Alright,

436
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,320
I'll be waiting for that day.

437
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,910
I'll arrange for you
to examine the body as soon as possible.

438
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:50,240
As for the Haiya clues,

439
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,300
just wait for news.

440
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:02,800
About Mrs. Lin...

441
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,560
After I catch Yesha,

442
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,090
I'll ask Xueman
to keep it a secret for you.

443
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,080
This is my first time

444
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,150
examining a corpse in a carriage.

445
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,040
We need to hurry.

446
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,870
Zhuge Kongyun only gave us

447
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:25,830
two hours

448
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,320
and we need to return
the body after examination.

449
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,080
Understood.

450
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,320
Any findings?

451
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,000
Just as we suspected,

452
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,350
besides the thunder gold,

453
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,810
there's also red crystal.

454
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,520
How come

455
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,110
Old Bug's heart is so swollen?

456
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,080
Xueman said

457
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,010
on the day that Old Bug died,

458
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,480
after taking the pill...

459
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,150
His internal energy was so strong

460
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,800
that he could injure her
with a single strike.

461
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,770
Old Bug wasn't skilled in martial arts.

462
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,320
If he could possess enough power

463
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,080
to overpower Constable Zhong

464
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,670
after taking this pill,

465
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,960
and if this pill were mass-produced,

466
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,320
wouldn't it cause chaos
throughout the land?

467
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:06,910
This is likely

468
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,150
Yesha's plan.

469
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,240
Wait.

470
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:10,870
Old Bug's heart

471
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,190
is so swollen like this.

472
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,280
Even if someone briefly possessed

473
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,240
such power,

474
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,320
their heart would rupture

475
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,040
and they would die shortly after.

476
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,590
Even if the pill could be mass-produced,

477
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,520
they wouldn't cause much trouble.

478
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:22,320
I suspect this pill is still incomplete.

479
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,670
That's why Huang Wuchang
forced Tong Shuang

480
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:24,720
to take the pill

481
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,960
that day on the mountaintop.

482
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,800
It was to verify

483
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,960
the pill's potency.

484
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,350
But Old Bug understood pharmacology.

485
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,110
This pill is still a prototype.

486
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,010
Its toxicity is severe,

487
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,110
and no antidote can reverse it.

488
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,560
He knew that after taking it,

489
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,870
he would certainly die shortly after,

490
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,800
even if he could temporarily escape.

491
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,150
Why would he still take it?

492
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,590
That's also

493
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,870
what's been puzzling me.

494
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:42,670
Xueman said

495
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,720
Old Bug rambled incoherently

496
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,040
before he died.

497
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,650
Looks like we'll need to visit Haiya.

498
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,190
[Wu Zhui fell ill. His Majesty ordered him
to heal in the capital's suburbs]

499
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,960
Wu Zhui?

500
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,240
Who is Wu Zhui?

501
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,560
The clues Zhuge Kongyun found

502
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,590
must be related to the Canfeng Army.

503
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,520
Why does the name Wu Zhui

504
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,430
sound so familiar?

505
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,670
Of course it's familiar.

506
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:07,430
He's a prominent figure

507
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,630
in the Qi Kingdom

508
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:09,960
and one of the people

509
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,560
I respect most in my life.

510
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,240
Beiming, you know this person?

511
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,630
He came from humble beginnings,

512
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,910
yet he possesses an unyielding spirit.

513
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,560
Shortly after passing the imperial exam,

514
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,000
he dared to stand in the imperial court

515
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,390
and openly declare to the late emperor

516
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,520
that the national policies
at the time were flawed.

517
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,320
Afterward,
he harshly rebuked court officials,

518
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,320
saying they couldn't guide
the emperor above,

519
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,350
nor benefit the people below.

520
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,390
He said they weren't earning their keep.

521
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,430
That's so bold!

522
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,520
Why didn't the late emperor behead him?

523
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,490
The late emperor valued talent,

524
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:35,940
believing he was just a scholar

525
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,280
who could only talk theory,

526
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,870
so he sent Wu Zhui
to the army at the border,

527
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,390
hoping to temper his spirit.

528
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,390
Little did he know,

529
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:43,960
Mr. Wu was no mere theorist.

530
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,320
Clad in white, he stayed at the border

531
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,320
for several years,

532
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,190
never holding a weapon,

533
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,320
and never staining himself with blood.

534
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,480
With just paper and brush,

535
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,830
using brilliant strategies,

536
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:53,030
he repelled multiple enemy invasions.

537
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,240
That's incredible!

538
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,460
Then his name should be

539
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,860
on the Lang Hua Pavilion.

540
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,460
After the late emperor passed away,

541
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,760
he returned to the court.

542
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,520
After His Majesty ascended the throne,

543
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,090
Wu Zhui didn't take a position in court.

544
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,110
Instead, he requested

545
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,080
to carry the royal staff

546
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,480
and serve as an envoy
to foreign countries.

547
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:09,670
He traveled
the Western Regions for many years,

548
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,570
secretly resolving countless conflicts

549
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,010
for the Qi Kingdom.

550
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,190
He's truly a legend.

551
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,280
Zhuge Kongyun mentioned in his letter

552
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,900
[Wu Zhui fell ill. His Majesty ordered him
to heal in the capital's suburbs]

553
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,870
that Wu Zhui fell seriously ill
six months ago.

554
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,630
His Majesty ordered him
to return to the capital to recover,

555
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:21,620
and he's now staying in

556
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,110
a farmstead in the suburbs.

557
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,350
Perhaps it was

558
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,190
his military service at the border

559
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,110
that aroused Zhuge Kongyun's suspicion

560
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,510
of him being connected to
the Canfeng Army.

561
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,280
Let's go find him now.

562
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,000
Xueman.

563
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,000
Let me go this time.

564
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,000
How can you go alone?

565
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:42,800
Beiming,

566
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,100
if this Mr. Wu

567
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,560
is truly connected to the Canfeng Army,

568
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,420
then he likely is

569
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,860
Yesha's next target.

570
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,240
-Should we…
-What happened to Mr. Shen

571
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,350
cannot happen again.

572
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,110
If Yesha's men

573
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,280
are still in the capital,

574
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,170
your every move

575
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,590
will be constantly watched.

576
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,480
However, I should

577
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,480
be in the Elite Constabulary Unit's
prison right now,

578
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,390
so I'm the most suitable person for this.

579
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,240
Besides,

580
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,860
I've recovered from my illness,

581
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,840
and my internal energy is restored.

582
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,060
Even if something happens to me,

583
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,290
I have ways to escape.

584
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,050
Tong Shuang,

585
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,610
prepare a carriage for me.

586
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:16,760
Alright.

587
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,000
Don't worry.

588
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,320
Old sir.

589
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,320
Young Master, how can I help you?

590
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,720
I'm looking for someone.

591
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:58,080
Young Master, who are you looking for?

592
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,760
You.

593
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,190
Mr. Wu.

594
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,630
You've mistaken me for someone else.

595
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,480
I'm just a farmer.

596
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,390
There's no Mr. Wu here.

597
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,320
Young Master,

598
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,590
it's raining hard.

599
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,030
You should hurry home and take shelter.

600
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,480
I heard that in the Battle of Juyong Pass,

601
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,390
you were unfortunately hit
in the leg by a stray arrow,

602
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,650
leaving you disabled.

603
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,810
I saw you walking just now.

604
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,440
You must've injured your right leg.

605
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,520
Ordinary farmers
have calluses on their hands,

606
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,390
but mostly between
the thumb and index finger,

607
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,630
while yours are on your fingertips.

608
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,520
This comes from years of holding a brush

609
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,370
to write.

610
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,430
Moreover,

611
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,160
that murderous aura you carry

612
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,650
cannot be concealed

613
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:49,980
by that straw raincoat.

614
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,910
Who are you,

615
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,830
and what do you want with me?

616
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,350
[Elite Constabulary Unit]

617
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,760
I'm a constable from
the Elite Constabulary Unit.

618
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,190
I have important matters to discuss.

619
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:04,960
Mr. Wu,

620
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,890
please find a quiet place
where we can talk in detail.

621
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,960
With such observation
and deduction skills,

622
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,000
you must not be an ordinary person.

623
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,280
Coincidentally,

624
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,590
of all young people of the Qi Kingdom

625
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,720
that I know of,

626
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,390
only two possess such skills.

627
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,520
One is the son of the Chief
of the Secret Investigation Unit,

628
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,580
known as Qi Kingdom's top detective.

629
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:39,190
The other is the disciple
of the King of Constables

630
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:41,720
and is now Qi Kingdom's
most wanted criminal.

631
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,080
You just displayed

632
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,320
the token of the Elite Constabulary Unit,

633
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,760
so you must not be

634
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,590
from the Zhuge family.

635
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,320
Mr. Wu, you're indeed impressive.

636
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,150
I am Xiao Beiming.

637
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:54,590
Sit.

638
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:56,720
At this moment,

639
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,390
you should be in prison.

640
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,500
It seems the Elite Constabulary Unit

641
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,590
has had some serious trouble.

642
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:01,800
It's a long story.

643
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,240
I've risked coming here

644
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,560
out of desperation.

645
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,670
Are you here to kill me?

646
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,760
Mr. Wu, you misunderstand.

647
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,000
It was villains

648
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,390
who framed me as Yesha.

649
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,630
I've come to you

650
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,480
to uncover some truths.

651
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:17,870
What truths?

652
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:19,210
Haiya.

653
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,110
How much do you know?

654
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,830
Mr. Wu, you must have been

655
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,150
part of the Canfeng Army

656
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,430
with my master,

657
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:40,040
General Huo Zongyao, and Mr. Miao Jie.

658
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,280
I've come to you

659
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,150
to discover the truth
about the Canfeng Army

660
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,720
and Haiya.

661
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,910
It seems

662
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,910
you've uncovered quite a bit.

663
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,800
My old friends

664
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,520
probably didn't understand

665
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,870
that these matters

666
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,760
can't be kept a secret

667
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,830
even if they've died.

668
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,670
Mr. Wu, I...

669
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,760
I once swore with my life

670
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,710
that I would never reveal

671
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,630
anything about Haiya to anyone.

672
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,960
I cannot help you with this matter.

673
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,830
If you are Yesha,

674
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,350
you can take

675
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,670
this old life of mine.

676
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:39,560
Mr. Wu,

677
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,830
I am not Yesha.

678
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,040
That doesn't matter.

679
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,080
You only have two choices now.

680
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,240
Either kill me

681
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,350
or leave.

682
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,910
Mr. Wu,

683
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,240
there's a massive conspiracy behind Yesha.

684
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,670
If his plot succeeds,

685
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,280
the entire Qi Kingdom will face disaster.

686
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:54,750
Mr. Wu,

687
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:56,150
you've devoted yourself to the Qi Kingdom.

688
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:56,850
Surely you don't want

689
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:57,960
to see this happen?

690
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,670
Some calamities

691
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,350
are destined to happen

692
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,960
and cannot be stopped by human effort.

693
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,160
You think you're investigating a case,

694
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:08,150
but you don't realize

695
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:09,560
that what you're investigating

696
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,760
will cause bloodshed

697
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,020
throughout the Qi Kingdom in the future.

698
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,430
In a sense,

699
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,830
you are no different from Yesha.

700
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:21,720
I don't agree

701
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,570
with what you said, Mr. Wu.

702
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:24,590
In this world, there are

703
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,190
no predestined calamities,

704
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,240
only the treachery of human hearts.

705
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,830
And the only thing

706
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,490
that can stop it is justice.

707
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:32,760
All these years,

708
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,870
what has kept me going

709
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,680
is also the word "justice."

710
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,520
Mr. Wu,

711
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,720
I will not kill you,

712
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,690
but before I find out the truth...

713
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,680
I will not leave either.

714
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:13,480
Follow me.

715
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,350
Mr. Wu,

716
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:20,880
what's the meaning of this?

717
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,240
I'm putting in poison.

718
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,390
A deadly poison.

719
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:31,870
In my life, I've faced
countless dead ends,

720
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,670
but I've always found a way out.

721
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,760
This poisoned drink

722
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,870
is the solution I offer you.

723
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,090
I don't understand.

724
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,080
Although I once swore

725
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,040
never to reveal Haiya's truth

726
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,320
to anyone,

727
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,560
that doesn't include the dead.

728
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,350
If you drink this,

729
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,350
you'll have about 15 minutes to live.

730
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,390
During this time,

731
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,560
you may ask me

732
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,960
three questions.

733
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:56,800
If you refuse,

734
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:58,280
then I will drink it.

735
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,320
This will spare Yesha the trouble,

736
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:03,280
and I can meet your master sooner

737
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,110
to reminisce about the past.

738
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,020
What do you think?

739
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,960
From everything you just said,

740
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,590
I only agree

741
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,760
that human hearts are treacherous.

742
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:16,800
Just like how

743
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,430
I can't verify whether you are

744
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,630
Yesha or not,

745
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,150
nor do I wish to.

746
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,800
Let's make it simple.

747
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,430
Who lives and who dies

748
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,060
will be as clear as day.

749
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,590
You have ten counts

750
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,830
to decide.

751
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,590
Mr. Wu.

752
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,040
Ten.

753
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,830
Nine.

754
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,830
Eight.

755
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,020
Seven.

756
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,040
Six.

757
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,380
Five.

758
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,110
Four.

759
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,110
Three.

760
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,120
Two.

761
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,830
One.

762
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,000
What are you doing, young man?

763
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,870
Will you drink it or not?

764
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,350
I will...

765
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,080
drink this.

766
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,160
You really dare to drink it?

767
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:18,690
But before I drink,

768
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,430
I have three requests.

769
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,020
Consider them my dying wishes.

770
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,540
I hope you will grant them.

771
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,450
Fine, let's hear them.

772
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,720
First.

773
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,530
I hope you will keep your promise.

774
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,590
You must answer my three questions

775
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,960
without hiding anything.

776
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,420
That goes without saying.

777
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:38,800
Second.

778
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,320
After I die,

779
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,920
please notify Zhong Xueman

780
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,110
from the Elite Constabulary Unit
to collect my body,

781
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,000
and ensure my body

782
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,870
is returned to her intact.

783
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,040
Alright.

784
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:53,760
Third,

785
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,040
my investigation

786
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,960
is of utmost importance

787
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,690
and must remain confidential.

788
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,150
I can die,

789
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,980
but I cannot allow

790
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:04,610
the Elite Constabulary Unit
to be implicated.

791
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,800
I hope you will keep this secret for me.

792
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:08,870
You're honorable.

793
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,240
I promise you.

794
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,080
It's a deal.

795
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,640
You don't have much time left.

796
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,340
Ask whatever you want.

797
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,560
Did the Canfeng Army
massacre people in Haiya?

798
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,150
That year, I was a military advisor

799
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:45,350
in the Canfeng Army.

800
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,390
The massacre did happen.

801
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,830
I personally

802
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,810
killed civilians in Haiya too.

803
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,550
Why did the Canfeng Army

804
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:59,280
target the civilians of Haiya?

805
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,110
It's extremely complicated.

806
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,960
It's a long story.

807
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,430
You don't have enough time

808
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,830
to hear me finish.

809
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,520
All I can tell you is

810
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,290
this had to be done.

811
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,400
Those people had to die.

812
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,850
Are there still any Canfeng Army soldiers

813
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,240
and Haiya orphans

814
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,390
in the army?

815
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,670
On the 12th bookshelf of

816
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,390
the Imperial Secretariat's
Heavenly Chamber,

817
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:33,560
there's a registry of Haiya orphans.

818
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,830
It documents

819
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,830
the surviving Canfeng Army soldiers

820
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,280
and the adopted orphans.

821
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,970
I'm telling you this,

822
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:47,780
but you'll never be able to find it.

823
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:51,780
I should remind you

824
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,040
that even if you've made records

825
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,020
of our conversation today,

826
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:57,890
I'll burn all these scraps

827
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,330
after your death.

828
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:02,670
I suggest you save some time

829
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,240
to leave your last words quickly,

830
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,100
so I can pass them to Zhong Xueman.

831
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,560
What are you doing?

832
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:16,060
When the Elite Constabulary Unit's
constables are on missions,

833
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,670
they always carry wax balls

834
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:18,720
so that in critical moments,

835
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,980
they can hide important information
inside their bodies.

836
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:27,040
Some people

837
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:28,960
also treat it as a will.

838
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,430
I've always kept this habit.

839
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,320
Mr. Wu,

840
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:38,690
you've been loyal to your principles
all your life.

841
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,160
You won't go back on your word, will you?

842
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,800
I didn't expect that in just ten counts,

843
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,730
you'd already devised a strategy.

844
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,440
I have traveled throughout all kingdoms,

845
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:53,240
and met countless heroes and talents,

846
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,350
but today,

847
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:57,630
I must admit that you, Xiao Beiming,

848
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,720
have impressed me.

849
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,520
Secrets

850
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,630
can be buried forever,

851
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,230
but the truth

852
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,960
cannot.

853
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:24,810
Guards!

854
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,040
-My Lord.
-My Lord.

855
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,190
Go to the Elite Constabulary Unit

856
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,449
and find Zhong Xueman.

857
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,560
-Yes.
-Yes.

858
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,710
Secrets can be buried forever,

859
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,560
but the truth cannot.

860
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,670
Yunchi,

861
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,880
you've trained
a remarkable disciple.

862
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,670
Beiming, you're awake.

863
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,320
How did this happen?

864
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,580
What exactly happened?

865
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,310
Xueman,

866
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,010
how did I get back here?

867
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,090
Two farmers

868
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,140
came to the Elite Constabulary Unit
looking for me,

869
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,310
saying they had urgent business.

870
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,840
But I never actually saw them.

871
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,110
There was only a carriage,

872
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,920
where I found you unconscious.

873
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,040
You had no injuries,

874
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,500
so I brought you back here.

875
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,100
Just sit still.

876
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,480
I've sent Tong Shuang
to find Feng Qingzhuo.

877
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,810
What on earth happened?

878
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,560
Madman!

879
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,110
Madman!

880
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:29,710
He's here.

881
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,310
Hurry!

882
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:30,710
Beiming.

883
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,040
Beiming, you're awake.

884
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,440
He's fine.

885
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,080
Beiming,

886
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,560
what on earth happened?

887
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,750
Didn't you go to find Wu Zhui?

888
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:47,710
Did you meet him?

889
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:49,750
I did.

890
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,660
But Mr. Wu

891
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,800
gave me a test.

892
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,880
What test?

893
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,750
It's a long story.

894
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:57,480
Xueman, I need you

895
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,310
to go to the Imperial Secretariat

896
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:58,880
and retrieve

897
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,010
something crucial.

898
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,760
Mind the step, Constable Zhong.

If it were me,

The fact that I'm fine now

908
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:29,750
proves that Mr. Wu

909
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:32,080
has doubts about the Haiya incident,

910
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,550
and his previous actions

911
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:35,190
were just to test me.

He used death to test one's heart.

He really is

915
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,560
a ruthless and unpredictable man.

916
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:45,520
That damned Wu Zhui

917
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,040
actually made you take poison!

Calm down.

920
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,000
Didn't I test it?

921
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,400
It wasn't poisoned.

922
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,630
But what if it had been?

923
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,960
Beiming would be dead now!

I'm fine now, aren't I?
