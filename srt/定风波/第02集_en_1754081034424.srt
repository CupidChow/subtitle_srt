2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,720
You said you could solve the case in three days.

3
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,000
But what happened?

4
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The minister of the State was assassinated on the street.

5
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,200
Is this how you, Lord Zhong Bu,

6
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,800
and Shen Buying,

7
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,040
Your Majesty, Shen Buying, Xiao Beiming, wants to see you.

8
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,480
Good timing. Let him in.

9
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,280
I'd like to see how he explains to me.

10
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Xiao Beiming greets Your Majesty.

11
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,840
Good for you, Xiao Beiming.

12
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,480
You can't even blame Lord Shen for his death.

13
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,240
I'll give you a decent visit today.

14
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,240
Your Majesty, where does this come from?

15
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,440
Where does it come from?

16
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,160
From the fact that Lord Shen was assassinated on the street.

17
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,160
Your Majesty, Lord Shen wants to report this to you in person.

18
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,320
I, Shen Bi, greet Your Majesty.

19
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,440
Lord Shen.

20
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,920
Chen Lai Sheng.

21
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,440
Make a statement.

22
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,120
I asked someone to make a mask.

23
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,520
It's enough to prove your innocence.

24
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,640
The man who died on the horse was Shen Buying's death.

25
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,320
I wanted to use this opportunity to catch Ye Shao.

26
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,160
But I couldn't return without a credit.

27
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,760
Xiao Beiming, you promised me

28
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,120
that this case would progress in three days.

29
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,760
Now that the time has come,

30
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,600
you'd better give me an explanation today.

31
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,600
I'm going to report to Your Majesty

32
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,760
the death of the three lords,

33
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,000
the Saddle of Blood and the Three Deadly Sins.

34
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,440
Stand up and speak.

35
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

36
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,440
Master.

37
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,920
Zhong Ai, stand up, too.

38
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,920
Master.

39
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,480
I'll start with the Saddle of Blood.

40
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,120
Although His Majesty ordered people to wipe the blood on the Saddle,

41
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,800
I found the traces of blood on the Saddle.

42
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,640
In fact, the so-called blood is just a special kind of spicy.

43
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,920
There is a kind of spicy, called the Moluo Spicy.

44
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,800
It's a ritual item commonly used in the temple.

45
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,520
It's very rare in the Central Plains.

46
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,880
This spicy food is not colored at normal temperature.

47
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,280
But when it's heated,

48
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,880
it immediately melts and turns red.

49
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,200
It's also called Phoenix Spicy.

50
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,640
It needs the meaning of Phoenix's fire.

51
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,640
Before the ritual,

52
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,840
someone put a Phoenix Spicy on the Saddle's eyes.

53
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,320
Once the Saddle shed blood,

54
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,440
he killed the palace official on the Saddle

55
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,880
and caused the punishment of the Heaven.

56
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,120
The Wolf's Hall is heavily guarded.

57
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,640
How did the thief sneak in and out?

58
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,880
He didn't need to sneak in.

59
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,080
He just went to buy and guard the eunuch of the Wolf's Hall.

60
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,480
He didn't expect it to be so big.

61
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,800
When I found him,

62
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,360
he committed suicide for the crime

63
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,720
or was killed by the Night God.

64
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,440
How do you explain that

65
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,680
my three subordinates died?

66
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,480
I'll start with Mr. Lu.

67
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,840
I found the trees on both sides of the road

68
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,680
at the scene of Mr. Lu's murder.

69
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,560
There are traces of silk threads tied up.

70
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,320
I guess it's because Mr. Lu

71
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,880
ran away at high speed

72
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,400
and hit the silk thread that the murderer tied up in advance

73
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,920
and cut off the throat.

74
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,360
This thread is special and called the Blood Dragon Thread.

75
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,080
It's made by a kind of dark-brewed sect in the martial arts world.

76
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,800
This thread is strong and has a light and clear color.

77
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,840
It's only used as a bamboo thread in the jungle.

78
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,400
It won't cause suspicion.

79
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,640
What about Mr. Qin and Mr. Fan?

80
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,680
Mr. Qin was burned to death

81
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,320
because someone had applied a special fuel

82
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,240
to his clothes in advance.

83
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,080
It had the ingredient of xiao-tide.

84
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,760
Mr. Qin had a bad eye.

85
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,960
When he was writing the report,

86
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,680
he was always in the mood for the scene.

87
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,120
He was burned by the fire and burned his clothes.

88
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,640
The fire was lit by the special fuel

89
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,600
and burned into ashes.

90
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,080
The xiao-tide was salty and bitter.

91
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,920
It could be distinguished by the taste.

92
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,360
Mr. Fan had a face wound.

93
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,480
He was in pain.

94
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,240
He had to wash his face with medicine every day.

95
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,720
The medicine bag was poisonous.

96
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,840
But there was one medicine

97
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,320
with the wrong amount.

98
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,760
The doctor named Mr. Lang

99
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,200
had one medicine in his mouth.

100
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,520
But there were five medicine bags in his mouth.

101
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,880
Mr. Lang's poison

102
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,000
was injected through the damage of the face wound.

103
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,680
Mr. Fan was paralyzed

104
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,080
and couldn't get up.

105
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,280
He was dying in the face wound.

106
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,400
The word night-dream in the mirror

107
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,240
was written in the morning with a sour leaf.

108
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,320
He was burning with heat

109
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,880
and was in a dangerous situation.

110
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,600
So that's how it is.

111
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,160
Did you find out

112
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,600
who he was?

113
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,480
Although the night-dream broke my trap,

114
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,160
I found out his identity very soon.

115
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,160
Since he broke your trap,

116
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,760
why were you so confident

117
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,440
that you could find out his identity?

118
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,440
Because I made him break the trap on purpose.

119
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,600
I agreed to let you

120
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,560
confuse the night-dream with the four-wheeled carriage.

121
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,480
But how dare you

122
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,880
play the game behind my back?

123
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,960
Tell me, what do you think?

124
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,960
Master, please calm down.

125
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,360
The four-wheeled carriage is the biggest evil trick.

126
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,640
It's hard to get rid of them.

127
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,360
It's their fault.

128
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,560
It's their fault that they saved Shen Dan's life.

129
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,840
You bastard!

130
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,360
Even if they are convicted,

131
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,600
they might have been killed

132
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,880
before they were executed.

133
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,080
You have no right to take other people's lives.

134
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,760
Do you think it's legal?

135
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,280
Master,

136
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,320
I think there is a way to punish them.

137
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,400
We should follow the rules.

138
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,520
We should be careful.

139
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,880
Special training and special measures.

140
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,120
How can we break the case without any changes?

141
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,960
How can we arrest Night-Dream?

142
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,720
You...

143
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,800
I'll beat you to death.

144
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,880
Master, master.

145
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,120
No, I'm hiding it from you

146
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,600
because I'm afraid you'll object to it.

147
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,560
I was too cautious.

148
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,320
I only made one mistake.

149
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,040
I made the right one.

150
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,200
His Majesty didn't blame us.

151
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,120
Night-Dream was also set.

152
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,600
The most important thing now is to arrest Night-Dream.

153
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,040
We shouldn't argue here.

154
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,200
Master.

155
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,080
Is my father and my senior inside?

156
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,720
Don't go in there.

157
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,000
After they came back from the palace,

158
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,320
Master was so angry.

159
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,520
They seemed to have quarreled.

160
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,400
What?

161
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,760
You are so arrogant.

162
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,880
I'm afraid you'll be

163
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,040
on your arrogance sooner or later.

164
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,120
You are still young.

165
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,520
You'll marry Xue Man soon.

166
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,680
I don't want you to go

167
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,960
and regret it in the future.

168
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,040
Do you understand?

169
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,640
Master, you raised me up

170
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,640
and taught me skills.

171
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,880
You are so kind.

172
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,040
You are my biological father.

173
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,400
I will never be disloyal to you.

174
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,120
You said I was wrong.

175
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,280
After the case was over,

176
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,360
Night-Dream was caught.

177
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,920
I'm asking for your father's forgiveness.

178
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,160
I'll punish you

179
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,280
according to your order.

180
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,800
Forget it.

181
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,840
Shen Renyu,

182
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,600
never give up

183
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,160
and never give up.

184
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,000
Only after

185
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,400
the disaster is over

186
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,280
can you know

187
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,480
to be careful.

188
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,720
Let's not talk about it for now.

189
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,360
Let's talk about it after the case is over.

190
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,800
Thank you, Master.

191
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,520
Master.

192
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,480
Hey.

193
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,600
You said in the palace

194
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,800
you wanted to let Night-Dream break the trap

195
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,880
to find out his identity.

196
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,840
What happened?

197
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,480
When I found out the three lords'

198
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,480
death,

199
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,920
I found out that Night-Dream's identity

200
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,800
was not ordinary.

201
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,520
The three lords' life habits,

202
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,440
where they were hiding,

203
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,280
were always confidential.

204
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,880
It's not something ordinary people can find out.

205
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,200
So I suspected...

206
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,680
You suspected Night-Dream was a court official?

207
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,400
Yes.

208
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,160
But there are many court officials.

209
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,400
They must narrow the scope.

210
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,480
So I used the four-horse carriage

211
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,080
that came out of the Shen Mansion

212
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,000
to make an article.

213
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,400
I used the name of the court official

214
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,160
to pass the fake news

215
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,760
of Lord Shen on the four-horse carriage

216
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,040
to officials with

217
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,480
the ability to commit crimes.

218
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,440
However,

219
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,840
only I had problems

220
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,440
with the carriage.

221
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,080
Lord Shen.

222
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:28,960
Lord Shen.

223
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,760
That means

224
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,240
the person who knew about this route

225
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,080
is the most suspicious.

226
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,960
The second-in-command of the Military Command

227
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,320
is a powerful man with a mysterious behavior.

228
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,440
He also has a close relationship with Jianghu.

229
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,960
Night-Dream has so many

230
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,800
strange and strange cases.

231
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,080
He is highly suspicious.

232
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,000
All things are ok.

233
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:54,400
Kindness,

234
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,480
You looks нашited.

235
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,600
Nakashima.

236
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,000
Hurry.

237
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,080
We are close to the deliver.

238
00:09:59,240 --> 00:09:59,760
We need more不要.

239
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,720
Vada.

240
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,600
Maid Mei.

241
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,760
S jours des 4 heures.

242
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,360
but no direct evidence.

243
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,160
And these three people are highly skilled

244
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,160
and smart.

245
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,760
If they follow up on the investigation,

246
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,160
they will definitely be found.

247
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,160
If they want new clues,

248
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,760
they have to go back to the case.

249
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,160
If they go back to the case,

250
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,560
more high-ranking officials will die.

251
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,760
Now the court

252
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,360
can't take

253
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,160
more momentum.

254
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,960
Actually, there is a way.

255
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,560
We just need to find an opportunity

256
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,960
to gather them

257
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,960
and try to question them.

258
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,360
If you are confident,

259
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,360
you can tell who is the real Ye Sheng.

260
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,560
What's the way?

261
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,760
What do you think?

262
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,160
This is the best chance

263
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,160
for you and Xue Man.

264
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,160
How can you do this?

265
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,560
This is the best time.

266
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,560
We missed this time.

267
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,160
I don't know how many cases Ye Sheng will commit.

268
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,160
Ye Sheng is a cruel man.

269
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,160
If something happens,

270
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,160
how will you handle it?

271
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,160
It's better to learn from the tiger than to learn from the tiger.

272
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,160
Master, have some tea.

273
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,560
Master,

274
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,160
play chess with me.

275
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,360
This is not the way I taught you.

276
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,960
You are

277
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,960
playing the game with me.

278
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,360
I created this.

279
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,160
Master,

280
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,160
would you like to play chess with me?

281
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,160
Go ahead.

282
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,160
I never play chess

283
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,160
to play any game.

284
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,760
Once I have a bad idea,

285
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,960
the game will be not pure.

286
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,760
Master,

287
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,360
I have already

288
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
exposed Ye Sheng's identity.

289
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,360
He is not my opponent.

290
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,160
Why can't I be there tomorrow?

291
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,160
Because you want to win him.

292
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,160
You have been through many cases.

293
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,760
No one is your opponent.

294
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,960
In terms of breaking the case,

295
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,160
you have to admit

296
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,160
your talent.

297
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,160
You have already been out of the game.

298
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,160
Then you should treat me better tomorrow.

299
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,160
Because of this,

300
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,160
your heart

301
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,160
can't calm down.

302
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,160
You are too proud

303
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,160
and even a father.

304
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,160
You treat Ye Sheng

305
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
as a opponent

306
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,160
who can play games with you.

307
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,160
But his real purpose

308
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,160
is not to win.

309
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,160
Master,

310
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,160
I don't understand.

311
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,160
Ye Sheng

312
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,160
is more terrible

313
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,160
than all the opponents

314
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,160
you have met before.

315
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,160
He is good at using people's hearts.

316
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,160
And your proud and restless heart

317
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,160
is your biggest weakness.

318
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,160
It seems that

319
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,160
you beat him.

320
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,160
But how do you know

321
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,160
he has no backup?

322
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,160
How do you know

323
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,160
he didn't let you win

324
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,160
on purpose?

325
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,160
Once he uses you,

326
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,160
the consequences

327
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,160
will be unimaginable.

328
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,160
You are showing off

329
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,160
your ambition.

330
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,160
You should also show off.

331
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,160
Master,

332
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,160
I won.

333
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,160
Why is the bride

334
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,160
not doing her hair?

335
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,160
What is she doing?

336
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,160
Did you hear that?

337
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,160
Someone is asking you.

338
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,160
I am not an ordinary bride.

339
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,160
The horse dress I'm wearing

340
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,160
is also extraordinary.

341
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,160
Zhou Hanyuan,

342
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,160
you can wear

343
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,160
the bad dress you usually wear.

344
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,160
Why are you still wearing the red dress today?

345
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,160
I can wear whatever I want.

346
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,160
Can you handle it?

347
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,160
Zhou Hanyuan,

348
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,160
I'm getting married today.

349
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,160
I want to hear a good news.

350
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,160
Ye Sheng hasn't been caught yet.

351
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,160
Don't be too proud.

352
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,160
Shuangxi is coming.

353
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,160
I'll let you catch up.

354
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,160
Brother Cheng,

355
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,160
congratulations.

356
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,160
Lord Bo wants you to get married.

357
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,160
Please let us be the rightful ones.

358
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,160
Brother Zheng,

359
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,160
I'm honored.

360
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,160
I'm flattered.

361
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,160
I'm flattered.

362
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,160
It's a great honor

363
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,160
for you to come.

364
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,160
It's said that Brother Zhong loves his daughter like his life.

365
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,160
I wonder if Brother Zhong

366
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,160
is reluctant to marry his daughter today.

367
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,160
Who said no?

368
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,160
My daughter has her own reason.

369
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,160
Now that someone has married her,

370
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,160
it's kind of a good news for me.

371
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,160
But Brother Zhong,

372
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,160
you're marrying in Dingfeng Pavilion.

373
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,160
The situation is a little too big.

374
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,160
People who don't know

375
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,160
may think that

376
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,160
there's something important

377
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,160
going on in your Shen Buying.

378
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,160
You're so evil.

379
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,160
You're going to put everyone

380
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,160
in danger?

381
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,160
What if something happens?

382
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,160
How will you end up?

383
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,160
As long as the plan works,

384
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,160
I'm confident

385
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,160
that I can ensure

386
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,160
the safety of all the soldiers on the battlefield.

387
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,160
Vice Minister Fang,

388
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,160
this is General Huo Zongyao,

389
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,160
the commander of Yulin Lang.

390
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,160
Thank you, General,

391
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,160
for coming to help us today.

392
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,160
Greetings, General Huo.

393
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,160
Brother Zhong,

394
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,160
you and I don't have to be polite.

395
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,160
It's a big matter.

396
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,160
Tell me about your plan.

397
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,160
This is my land,

398
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,160
not my home.

399
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,160
I can't stay here for the night.

400
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,160
I have to find a place

401
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,160
where the scenery is beautiful.

402
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,160
It's a good place.

403
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,160
Okay.

404
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,160
It's reasonable.

405
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:51,000
Here comes the

406
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,160
General Huo.

407
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,160
Thank you.

408
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,160
Thank you.

409
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,160
First, bow to Heaven and Earth.

410
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,160
Second, bow to the parents.

411
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,160
What about Xue Man?

412
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,160
Have you considered her feelings?

413
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,160
Marriage and children are very important.

414
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,160
All these years,

415
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,160
she has given you so much love.

416
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,160
She has been afraid of this day for so long.

417
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,160
Do you want her to worry about

418
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,160
her husband's safety on this day?

419
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,160
I've heard what you said.

420
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,160
I agree with Brother Zhong's plan.

421
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,160
Sister.

422
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,160
When did you come?

423
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,160
Father,

424
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,160
I have been looking forward to this wedding for a long time.

425
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,160
But before that,

426
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,160
I am a compensator.

427
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,160
As a compensator,

428
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,160
I can't let the murderer go out of the way.

429
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,160
I can't let the innocent die.

430
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,160
Brother and I are under the government's control.

431
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,160
We are being fed by the people.

432
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,160
We can't live in the mountains and the sea.

433
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,160
Besides, it's just a wedding.

434
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,160
And if we can take this wedding

435
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,160
and successfully capture the night,

436
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,160
it will be the best wedding gift

437
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,160
Brother and I can give ourselves.

438
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,160
Father,

439
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,160
Brother has never lost.

440
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,160
I trust him more than anyone.

441
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,160
There will be no trouble tomorrow.

442
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,160
Love is like a shooting star

443
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:06,160
Love is like a shooting star

444
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:13,160
That moment, the wind blows gently

445
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:20,160
I can remember the past

446
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,160
This time, I will fight against the night.

447
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,160
Fight against the night.

448
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,160
In case I have a misdeed,

449
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:31,160
I will be relieved to have you by his side.

450
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,160
Master,

451
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,160
what do you mean?

452
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,160
Wei Ming,

453
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,160
this is not a mission.

454
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,160
It's a request from you as a father.

455
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,160
It's also my biggest selfish wish.

456
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,160
Wei Ming,

457
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,160
are you worried about father?

458
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,160
Don't worry.

459
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,160
Father is the Lord of the Dead.

460
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,160
He never makes mistakes.

461
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,160
With the night, he will be the first to come.

462
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,160
Junior Sister,

463
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,160
I always feel something wrong.

464
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,160
I've been working with my master for many years.

465
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,160
No matter how fierce our opponents are or how dangerous the situation is,

466
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,160
Master is calm and composed.

467
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,160
But I've never seen him so cool like yesterday.

468
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,160
Wei Ming,

469
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,160
What's the color?

470
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,280
What color?

471
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,360
Master,

472
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,320
seems to be explaining the future.

473
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,200
Dad, why are you here?

474
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,160
Here.

475
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,000
What's this?

476
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,760
This is your dowry.

477
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,640
I have all the land

478
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,840
and land assets

479
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,040
in the house.

480
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,720
You can take them out

481
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,160
with the money.

482
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,040
I have

483
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,520
not saved much in my life.

484
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,360
But if I save all of them,

485
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,920
you can have no worries.

486
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:01,920
Dad.

487
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,000
Listen to me.

488
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,960
Do you know

489
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,600
that girls' houses

490
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,960
have money

491
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,440
to have land assets?

492
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,240
Come on.

493
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,200
Let me carry it.

494
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:13,760
Dad.

495
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,640
Now that you're married,

496
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,080
I've done

497
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,720
a good deed.

498
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,400
In the future, when I go to Jiuxuan,

499
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,400
I'll see your mother

500
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,280
and I'll have an explanation.

501
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,040
He handed me this paper yesterday.

502
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,960
He said it was my dowry.

503
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,680
He's more like a man of duty.

504
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,160
I heard that

505
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,920
there's a windmill lake in Dingfeng Pavilion.

506
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,160
The view of the windmill lake

507
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,000
is really amazing.

508
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,400
You're right.

509
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,920
I've arranged it well.

510
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,520
We'll board the boat later.

511
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,520
The lake is bright and beautiful.

512
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,360
It's beautiful.

513
00:21:59,360 --> 00:21:59,760
Yes.

514
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,040
Brother Zhong, don't worry.

515
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,560
Let's enjoy the view of the yard first.

516
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,680
Then

517
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,800
let's have a cup of tea.

518
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,320
Let's go.

519
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,080
You're a good girl.

520
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,080
Brother, I'll send you there

521
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,960
to help dad capture Ye Sha.

522
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,520
Sorry, sister.

523
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,240
I promised Master

524
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,640
I wouldn't let you get hurt.

525
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,520
I'll be back.

526
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,120
Don't force yourself to be hurt by the snow.

527
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,520
Wait for me.

528
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:46,920
Everyone,

529
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,360
board the boat quickly.

530
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:48,920
Okay.

531
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,440
Please.

532
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:50,840
Please.

533
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,360
Okay.

534
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,000
Please wait a moment.

535
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,640
The groom is here.

536
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,040
Dad.

537
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,120
Why are you here?

538
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,920
I'm here to accompany you and Uncle Shu

539
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,360
to board the boat and ride the lake.

540
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,720
You should be with Xue Man in the room.

541
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,400
Xue Man asked me to come.

542
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,160
She saw Uncle Shu and Uncle Shu

543
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,440
and they went to the lake together.

544
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,240
She saw Uncle Shu was not in a good mood

545
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,480
and asked me not to lose Uncle Shu.

546
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,480
Look,

547
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,240
I'm here to accompany you.

548
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,600
How can I lose Uncle Shu?

549
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,320
Besides,

550
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,440
on the day of the wedding,

551
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,040
you won't blame me, right?

552
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,680
Go back quickly.

553
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,800
Dad, I...

554
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,880
Bei Ming,

555
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,000
listen to me.

556
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:26,960
Go back.

557
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,880
Brother Zhong,

558
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,240
since the groom has this kind of heart,

559
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,600
the bride doesn't mind.

560
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,600
Why don't you let her

561
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,120
ride the lake with us?

562
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,600
It won't be too late.

563
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,560
We can

564
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,360
enjoy the wedding ceremony.

565
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,280
Yes.

566
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,040
The groom has been to many weddings.

567
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,320
I'm already curious

568
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,760
about these cases.

569
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,520
Today,

570
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,240
I happen to be here to ask for advice.

571
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,760
Good.

572
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,680
You're lucky to ask for advice in person.

573
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,560
You shouldn't come here to attend the wedding ceremony.

574
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,680
I'm a young man.

575
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,960
Why should I ask for advice?

576
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,720
Besides,

577
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,440
I heard that on the wedding day,

578
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,480
the bride can't be alone in the wedding room.

579
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:12,840
Bei Ming,

580
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:13,840
go back.

581
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:15,960
Brother Zhong,

582
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,760
you're so stubborn.

583
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,000
Is there another reason

584
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,080
for you to be on this boat?

585
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,160
Brother Zhong,

586
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,640
you can say whatever you want.

587
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,960
Don't be so stubborn.

588
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,080
Brother Zhong,

589
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,040
are you having a miscarriage?

590
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:36,960
Look at you.

591
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,920
I'm just kidding.

592
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,960
My father loves women.

593
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,840
He doesn't want the bride to be alone in the wedding room.

594
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,520
Thanks to your kindness,

595
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,440
I'm honored to be here.

596
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,840
Master,

597
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,360
let me and all the uncles

598
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,480
board the boat.

599
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,480
Since you think so,

600
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:58,960
fine.

601
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,080
Let's board the boat together.

602
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,360
Thank you, Master.

603
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,320
Master,

604
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:04,840
please.

605
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,320
Please.

606
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,560
I didn't expect you to be so talented.

607
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,560
You must give me a toast.

608
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,120
Of course.

609
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,240
I'll drink to my heart's content.

610
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,680
Please.

611
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,920
Duan Yu'ron

612
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,240
Mo Xian Yu

613
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,000
hillarious,

614
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,800
hillarious.

615
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,600
How dare you suspect us?

616
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,600
This is your way of treating guests?

617
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,600
It seems that we can't leave yet.

618
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,600
Shen Buying is so bold.

619
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,600
He dared to kill an official in the court.

620
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,600
I will report this to His Majesty.

621
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,600
Zhong Yunche, you just wait to be punished.

622
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,600
Please calm down.

623
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,600
If His Majesty doesn't approve,

624
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,600
how can I do this?

625
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,600
What?

626
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,600
This is under His Majesty's order?

627
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,600
You don't have to panic.

628
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,600
As long as you can cooperate with our interrogation,

629
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,600
and find out the real murderer,

630
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,600
and solve our big problem,

631
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,600
and catch the murderer,

632
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,600
I will come to you to apologize.

633
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,600
Please.

634
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,600
You are the murderer of Ye Sha,

635
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,600
just because you used a carriage?

636
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,600
Am I right?

637
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,600
Yes.

638
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,600
Master Mei, do you have any questions?

639
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,600
I don't dare to ask.

640
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,600
But in terms of suspicion,

641
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,600
it must be more than us three.

642
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,600
If you know that the person you are going to kill is a suspect,

643
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,600
then there are suspects on this ship,

644
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,600
and the person who is going to kill is a suspect.

645
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,600
And the person who made this plan is

646
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,600
Lord Zhong Bu and Lord Xiao Shen.

647
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,600
If you have a suspicion with my master,

648
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,600
why do you have to solve the three cases?

649
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,600
Why do you have to go to Ye Sha and show up?

650
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,600
Isn't it the most common trick to catch the thief?

651
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,600
Just like the real cause of the death of Liu Xueli and the three masters,

652
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,600
as long as you know one way,

653
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,600
anyone can do it.

654
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,600
You are right.

655
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,600
Lord Yin has a deep background in the martial arts world,

656
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,600
and he knows some killing techniques and tricks.

657
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,600
But it seems that you two started solving the case after you knew it.

658
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,600
Who can say clearly that

659
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,600
Lord Yin knew it early,

660
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,600
or you knew it early?

661
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,600
Yes.

662
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,600
Miao Tianguan knows the whereabouts of the three masters,

663
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,600
and the habits of life.

664
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,600
Isn't it easy for you to investigate these things?

665
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,600
Interesting.

666
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,600
And the case of Lord Shen being stabbed,

667
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,600
we know which carriage Lord Shen is on.

668
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,600
You two naturally know it.

669
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,600
And Lord Shen was hurt by the hidden weapon in the carriage.

670
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,600
Ye Sha didn't show up.

671
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,600
As far as I know,

672
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,600
Lord Zhong Bu's hidden weapon skill is not bad.

673
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,600
According to the case,

674
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,600
the prisoner died on the carriage.

675
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,600
But you were the only one on the carriage.

676
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,600
No one else can prove

677
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,600
that the prisoner died of the hidden weapon,

678
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,600
or the person beside him.

679
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,600
Although everyone here has a suspicion,

680
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,600
Ye Sha is the only one.

681
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,600
Although I'm not good at solving cases and chasing after murder,

682
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,600
I have my own guess about Ye Sha's identity.

683
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,600
What I saw today

684
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,600
is more proof of Miao's speculation.

685
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,600
Lord Miao,

686
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,600
do you know who Ye Sha is?

687
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,600
Miao Tianguan,

688
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,600
what do you want to say?

689
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,600
Zhong Yunchi,

690
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,600
how long are you going to disguise yourself?

691
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,600
Lord Miao, don't talk nonsense.

692
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,600
Lord Zhong Bu always pays attention to the law and the law.

693
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,600
He never does anything illegal.

694
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,600
All the court officials know it.

695
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,600
But today,

696
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,600
he led us on the ship without any evidence.

697
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,600
He even set up a trap to kill us.

698
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,600
He set up a trap to kill us.

699
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,600
He set up a trap to kill us.

700
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,600
He set up a trap to kill us.

701
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,600
I also set up a trap to kill us.

702
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,600
Is this the way Zhong Bu always follows?

703
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,600
Is this the way Zhong Bu always follows?

704
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,600
It's obvious that he's a traitor.

705
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,600
It's obvious that he's a traitor.

706
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,600
You...

707
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,600
Kill us first

708
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,600
and then put the charges of Ye Sha

709
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,600
on anyone on the ship.

710
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,600
Others can say that

711
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,600
fighting with Ye Sha is an unlucky death,

712
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,600
thus escaping smoothly.

713
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,600
Little God,

714
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,600
why does your master insist not to let you board the ship?

715
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,040
Because you're not in his plan at all.

716
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,840
Am I right?

717
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,040
Lord Zhong Bu,

718
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,440
Zhong Yun Chi,

719
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,040
or should I call you

720
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,640
Ye Sha?

721
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,440
Nonsense.

722
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,080
My master asked all the lords to come here

723
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,440
to investigate Ye Sha's real identity.

724
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,680
He never wanted to frame me.

725
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,960
He never harmed Yu Ren.

726
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,960
I'm sorry.

727
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,960
Then,

728
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,960
I'll tell you another story.

729
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,200
Lord Miao,

730
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,880
don't make things

731
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,400
so hard that you can't even clean it up.

732
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,600
Since it's been passed down,

733
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,600
there's no turning back.

734
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,600
What story?

735
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,200
What do you want to say?

736
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,800
Lord Zhong Bu,

737
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,480
you should know

738
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,960
this story better than I do.

739
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,280
But it's been passed down for so long.

740
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,320
I'm sure the Ministry of War doesn't know

741
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,560
that you actually know

742
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,480
the real meaning of Ye Sha's son.

743
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,040
If you don't tell him,

744
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,240
are you worried that

745
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,280
he'll know what you did back then?

746
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,400
Ye Sha,

747
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,640
you still don't admit your guilt?

748
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,480
You still want me to continue?

749
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,760
If I really DS.

750
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,040
I'll give up my own crap by doing so.

751
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:05,840
This's not good.

752
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,880
Something's wrong.

753
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,200
You've tried your best

754
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:47,800
Come on

755
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,600
Come on

756
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,440
Come on

757
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,020
Hurry up

758
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:58,500
Come on

759
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,880
Come out

760
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,960
Kill you.

761
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,500
Kill him!

762
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,960
Who's sword? Who's sword?

763
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,960
Who's hurting behind?

764
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,960
Someone's crazy, someone's proud

765
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:38,900
Someone's

766
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:22,400
I'm sad

767
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:22,960
I'm alcohol

768
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,400
I'm broken

769
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,400
Who tied up the sword

770
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,420
Who has a sword

771
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,660
Who's hurting behind

772
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,660
Someone's crazy, someone's proud

773
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,540
An unspoken friend

774
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,320
Don't buzz

775
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,000
This road is called the red answer

776
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,380
He cries but concrete

777
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,580
Condemn is slower than a flood

778
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,000
Make his face a bit clearer

779
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,900
I'm salt

780
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,760
