1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Step on the needle, protest!

2
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:23,200
Being in love without any morals.

3
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,720
But narrowly following her mother.

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

5
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What kind of self will you encounter this summer?

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
A bite of the cold-hearted Snow.

7
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
A self with a sense of shame.

8
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Find your original self.

9
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
A self with quietness.

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Cold-hearted, heart flutters.

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Give your cool, Snow.

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Welcome you to watch the wind wave.

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The Long Ballad

14
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Junior sister.

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Thank you.

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Senior brother.

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You said Huo Zong Yao

18
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
was going to fight with my father.

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Is my father a tyrant?

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Three years ago,

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
in the Wind Waves Lake,

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
what Miao Jie wanted to say

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
was about the tyrant's revenge.

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
If that's true,

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
my father is a tyrant,

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
then he is also

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
the target of Ye Shao's revenge.

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
He can't be Ye Sha.

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I never believed

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
that Master was Ye Sha.

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I never believed that Master

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
would harm the people of the Ocean

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
who have no iron.

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
There are many doubts

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
about the Wind Waves Lake.

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Zhu Yi Tie said

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
he had never seen Ye Sha's true form.

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But he heard a voice

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
on the boat

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
that was very similar to Ye Sha.

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Now Qing Ying said that Ye Sha is not dead.

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The two of them have a lot in common.

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
There are many contradictions.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You suspect that

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm wrong

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
to conclude that

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Ye Sha was on the Wind Waves Lake.

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I also hope that I'm wrong.

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So that Master

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
won't have any suspicion.

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The more I investigate this case,

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
the more it seems to be

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
a dark matter.

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm not sure

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
whether it's a black hole or a cave.

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
There is a way ahead.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But the more I walk, the more I feel dangerous.

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm not sure.

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
No matter how long the night is,

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
the sun

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
will always rise.

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
According to Qing Ying's confession,

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Ye Sha ordered him

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
to poison and kill the Poisoned Herb by Feng Yi Niang

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and Chu Guang Sha.

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Why would Ye Sha

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
do that to these two people?

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Qing Ying also did it by order.

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
She didn't know the purpose of Ye Sha.

70
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That's all?

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That's all.

72
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Before I could ask her anything,

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Qing Ying committed suicide.

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
How did you find out about Chu Guang Sha?

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Why did you appear

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
at Chu Guang Sha's place of death?

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It was because of the account book of the Huo family.

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Huo Dai Rong found out

79
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
that the account book of the Huo family had a problem

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
and involved Guang Sha Villa.

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So I took someone there.

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I didn't expect

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
to see Chu Guang Sha die of an accident.

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I didn't expect

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Chu Guang Sha's death

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
had anything to do with Ye Sha.

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So I didn't inform the secret police in time.

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What's wrong with that account book?

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Chu Guang Sha was once bribed by Huo Zong Yao.

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
All these years,

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
he has been secretly

92
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
going to the Huo family for bribes.

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
These are all evidence.

94
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
If you need them,

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I can present the evidence.

96
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I care about Ye Sha the most.

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Besides,

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
have you found any clues

99
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
about Ye Sha?

100
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
What are you going to do

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
when you go to the secret police?

102
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I want to tell the secret police

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
about this.

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I want them to help me.

105
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
No.

106
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I want them to know

107
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
what I can tell them.

108
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I can't tell them

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
what I shouldn't tell them.

110
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Why?

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The history of the Cang Feng family's Haiya

112
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
has been leaked

113
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
in all the records on the surface.

114
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
In this world,

115
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
there is only one person

116
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
who can do this.

117
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You mean...

118
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Killing a city's people

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
is such a bad thing.

120
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
If you can't cover it up,

121
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
the foundation of the big picture will be shaken.

122
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
We can't predict

123
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
what he thinks.

124
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But if all the father and son know this,

125
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm afraid they will die.

126
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
That's all.

127
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I've told you everything I know.

128
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Brother,

129
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
it's time to eat.

130
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Brother.

131
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Brother, it's time to eat.

132
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Brother.

133
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Brother.

134
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Brother.

135
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
My magic trick

137
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
is useless to him now.

138
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I have to find the fire dust.

139
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Otherwise, Brother Zhao can't hold it.

140
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
How long can he hold it?

141
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Maybe five days.

142
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Maybe

143
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
tomorrow.

144
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Where are you going?

145
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Find someone.

146
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Feng,

147
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
do we have anything

148
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
to do for Brother now?

149
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The whole city is in a crisis.

150
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Even the chief of defense

151
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
has to get the Ministry of Justice.

152
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I can't do it.

153
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
He is very important to me.

154
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I have to find him as soon as possible.

155
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yes, I...

156
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I can help you in private,

157
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
right?

158
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
My brothers can help, too.

159
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
But this thing

160
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
doesn't comply with the rules.

161
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
If the Ministry of Justice doesn't know,

162
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Shen Buying will be in big trouble.

163
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Brother Jiang,

164
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm begging you this time.

165
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I...

166
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I...

167
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Who do you think he is?

168
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I don't know.

169
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I don't know what crime he committed.

170
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Junior sister,

171
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I can't help you.

172
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Senior brother,

173
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm sorry.

174
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I told you to be quick.

175
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I knocked down

176
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
that thief so quickly.

177
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Who knew that there was a sneak attack behind?

178
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That's why I got hurt.

179
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Be quiet.

180
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Where did you get this medicine?

181
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
The doll is here.

182
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
How did you know I was coming?

183
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I brought you here on purpose.

184
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Otherwise,

185
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I would be stupid to sell the medicine

186
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
to Shen Buying.

187
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Since you know I'm looking for you,

188
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
you even brought me here.

189
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You're not afraid that I'll catch you back?

190
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Put down what you have.

191
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
If I were afraid,

192
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I wouldn't have done that.

193
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm afraid that

194
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
you'll be in trouble.

195
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm afraid that

196
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
you'll be in trouble.

197
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm afraid that

198
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
you'll be in trouble.

199
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
What do you want?

200
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I want to make a deal with you.

201
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
A deal?

202
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What deal?

203
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
He's dying, right?

204
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What's dying?

205
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You can hide it from others,

206
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
but you can't hide it from me.

207
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Do you know who I'm talking about?

208
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
No one can compare to you

209
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
when it comes to killing people.

210
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I only saw him

211
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
in the ghost city that day.

212
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I knew he was dying.

213
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
If I'm not wrong,

214
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
he must have been poisoned by a cold poison.

215
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's already a miracle

216
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
that he's still alive.

217
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
What else do you know?

218
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You came to the ghost city that day to find me

219
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
to detoxify the fire silk in my hand.

220
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
To detoxify?

221
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I guess I'm not wrong.

222
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Since you said you wanted to make a deal,

223
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
then make a deal.

224
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I remember I told you

225
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
my rules.

226
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Since you want my eyes,

227
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
take them.

228
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You're such a cool girl.

229
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You're quite a bad girl.

230
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
But you're so pretty

231
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
that you're missing your eyes.

232
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I really can't bear to part with you.

233
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
What do you want?

234
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I want Little White Dragon.

235
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Who is Little White Dragon?

236
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It seems that guy didn't tell you

237
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
his real identity.

238
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Officer Zhong.

239
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
What's wrong with my senior?

240
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Brother Xiao is still in a coma.

241
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Officer Zhong,

242
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I know you're still worried about Brother Xiao.

243
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You've tried your best.

244
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
If it weren't for my mistake,

245
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Brother Xiao wouldn't be in this state.

246
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
We've been through so much together.

247
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
How can we still be separated?

248
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It doesn't matter who's right or wrong.

249
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I know.

250
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Officer Zhong,

251
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
no matter what the price is,

252
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'll cure Brother Xiao.

253
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Trust me.

254
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Officer Feng,

255
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I've been wanting to ask you something.

256
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Go ahead.

257
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
The old man we met in the ghost city that day,

258
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
do you really not know him?

259
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I don't know him.

260
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Why are you asking me this?

261
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's nothing.

262
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's just that I've never heard you mention

263
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
your childhood.

264
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm just a child of a farmer.

265
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I met a street-rover when I was a kid.

266
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
He taught me some skills.

267
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
There's nothing to say about that.

268
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
The Poisonous Valley is the world's number one bloodline.

269
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
The Golden Bell of the Poisonous City.

270
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
There's nothing to say about that.

271
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
The so-called Feng Wuzuo

272
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
is the little white dragon of the Poisonous Valley.

273
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
The Poisonous Valley?

274
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Little white dragon?

275
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm afraid he's the only one who knows

276
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
how many people he's got.

277
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Impossible.

278
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
The Poisonous Valley is not for people like him.

279
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
What?

280
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Do you think

281
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
the master of the Poisonous Valley

282
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
is a person who doesn't even dare to kill a chicken

283
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
or a Bodhisattva?

284
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's all a lie.

285
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm just lying to you.

286
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
This man is a wolf, he's ambitious, he's always reading.

287
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
He took away the Yin Yang Book, the treasure of the Poisonous Valley.

288
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm looking for him to avenge my brother.

289
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You take him as a friend.

290
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
But who knows what he wants to exchange your lives for?

291
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It seems that you still don't believe me.

292
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's okay.

293
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You catch him and give him to me.

294
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'll confront him face to face.

295
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's a matter of course.

296
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You think about it.

297
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Is it important to save the person?

298
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Or a lie

299
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
that may hurt you at any time?

300
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Zhong Mu Kui.

301
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Zhong Mu Kui.

302
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You look weird today.

303
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's okay.

304
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
My brother is seriously ill.

305
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm in a bad mood.

306
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I just want to talk to someone.

307
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Don't worry.

308
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'll save him even if I have to risk my life.

309
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Feng Wu Suo.

310
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Miss Huo.

311
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Miss Huo, why are you here?

312
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Qingying is dead.

313
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm the only one left in this big Huo Mansion.

314
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm really a little bit unwell.

315
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I was going to talk to Brother Xiao and Sister Xue Man.

316
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
But I didn't find it.

317
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm sorry.

318
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I was going to talk to Brother Xiao and Sister Xue Man.

319
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
But I don't know where to find them.

320
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
They are asleep.

321
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You drank.

322
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Something on your mind?

323
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
No.

324
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'll walk with you.

325
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I read in the medical book that

326
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
only by following the heart's desire can you relax.

327
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Feng Wu Suo.

328
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
If you believe me,

329
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
tell me what's on your mind.

330
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Miss Huo.

331
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
What is friendship?

332
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Why do you ask?

333
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
If you lie to your friends,

334
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
will they still be your friends?

335
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Will they blame you?

336
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Why?

337
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
When you are with someone,

338
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
you should focus on the character.

339
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You should focus on the word.

340
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
If you are deliberately lying,

341
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
it won't work.

342
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
At least,

343
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I won't be a fool to lie.

344
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
But there is an accident.

345
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
What accident?

346
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
If you don't have a heart to hurt,

347
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
and you don't have the right to do it,

348
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
why can't you lie?

349
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
In this life,

350
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
who hasn't lied a few times?

351
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Just like me and Brother Xiao,

352
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
and Zhong Bu Kuan.

353
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
They suspected me before.

354
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
They caused me a lot of trouble.

355
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I also deceived them.

356
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I caused them a lot of trouble.

357
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Now the matter is over.

358
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
My parents' case is now clear.

359
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I really want to be their friend.

360
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
A gentleman should focus on his character.

361
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
If you want to see someone,

362
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
you should focus on his words and actions.

363
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
If you are a real friend,

364
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
you won't care about what you did in the past.

365
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You will only look forward.

366
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Really?

367
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Of course.

368
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Isn't that what you did?

369
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Me?

370
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You are willing to stay by Brother Xiao's side.

371
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's not because he is the first wanted criminal in Da Qi

372
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
that you are afraid of him and want to stay away from him.

373
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I am afraid of him.

374
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Stay away from him.

375
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Isn't it because you believe in him

376
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
and believe that he is not a night fool

377
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
because you are so kind to him?

378
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
So you ran away for his innocence,

379
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
and worry about his safety.

380
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Why are you still suspicious

381
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
about what you have done?

382
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Seeing Feng Wu's face,

383
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I am a little confused.

384
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Thank you, Miss Hua.

385
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I will do my best.

386
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Those you want to save are more important.

387
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Or an empty lie

388
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
that might hurt you at any time

389
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
is more important?

390
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You should think about it.

391
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You have made up your mind?

392
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
As long as I can save his life,

393
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,600
I can do anything.

394
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,120
I can give you the man.

395
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,520
Where's the train?

396
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,320
One hand to hand over the man,

397
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,280
the other hand to hand over the train.

398
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,480
Where is the man?

399
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,600
It's not safe here.

400
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,600
I locked him up in a place in the suburbs.

401
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,040
I can take you there.

402
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,520
But we agreed in advance

403
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,800
that if you dare to make any mistake,

404
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,640
I will kill you in the wild.

405
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,760
I'll lead the way.

406
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
The man is here.

407
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,400
Where's the train?

408
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,120
I took the man away.

409
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,760
Let's meet again.

410
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,380
5 minutes before

411
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,800
I'll set off to talk to the Diviner.

412
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,120
Stranger.

413
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,960
The Diviner?

414
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,840
I'm sorry.

415
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,480
I'm sorry.

416
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,880
I've been lying to you all along.

417
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,840
Actually, I have another identity.

418
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,680
I'm Xiao Bailong.

419
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,440
I'm sorry.

420
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,680
I'm sorry.

421
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,320
I've been lying to you all along.

422
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,440
Actually, I know it all.

423
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,960
Old stinky bug.

424
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,520
Old stinky bug told me.

425
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,960
You met the old stinky bug?

426
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,440
What did he say?

427
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,080
He said

428
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,600
you killed your master

429
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,240
and took the Yin Yang Book.

430
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:22,840
No.

431
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,680
Impossible.

432
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,600
I can't kill my master.

433
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,040
I didn't take the Yin Yang Book.

434
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,480
I know.

435
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,560
I didn't take the Yin Yang Book.

436
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,320
I believe Feng Wuzuo is not that kind of person.

437
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,720
I've been looking for a chance

438
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,680
to say this today.

439
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,240
You're willing to believe me?

440
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,800
I don't know.

441
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,240
I don't think it's true.

442
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,640
It sounds more like a lie.

443
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,200
Yes.

444
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,520
Old stinky bug wants to provoke Li Jian.

445
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,960
But he doesn't know

446
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,400
what we've been through together.

447
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,080
If you're a bad person,

448
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,800
I've died countless times with my senior.

449
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,400
But I...

450
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,120
I won't say a word because of him.

451
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:58,760
I'll...

452
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,120
But I'm from Tu Jue Valley.

453
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,720
Is it important?

454
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,600
Thank you.

455
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,640
Thank you.

456
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,640
Old stinky bug wants to provoke Li Jian.

457
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,520
No.

458
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,560
He wants me to use Feng Wuzuo to exchange the fire silk.

459
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,560
I don't want to use Feng Wuzuo.

460
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,560
I don't want to use Feng Wuzuo.

461
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,760
I don't want to use Feng Wuzuo.

462
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,760
I don't want to use Feng Wuzuo.

463
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,760
I don't want to use Feng Wuzuo.

464
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,680
Qing то

465
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,420
You've chosen me.

466
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,720
Don't worry.

467
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,120
I won't do that.

468
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,120
I'll figure out the fire silk.

469
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,040
Imperial Doctor Zhong,

470
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,200
take my life for exchange.

471
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:56,960
Feng Wuzuo.

472
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,600
It's impossible.

473
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,600
Listen to me.

474
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,560
Listen to me,

475
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,400
I'm sorry.

476
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,840
You've been hiding here.

477
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,360
That's the place where Feng Bo Lake

478
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,840
changed Brother Xiao's fate three years ago.

479
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,840
Not only him,

480
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,080
but also me,

481
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,520
and many others,

482
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,960
including you.

483
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,280
No one would have thought of this place.

484
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,640
Brother Xiao is safe here.

485
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,840
You brought me here.

486
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,280
Do you believe me now?

487
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,360
Actually, there's another reason

488
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,480
why I brought you here.

489
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,720
He's unconscious now and can't talk.

490
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,040
So I'm here to talk for him.

491
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,360
What are you talking about?

492
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,240
We misunderstood you before.

493
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,280
We apologize to you.

494
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,360
You're so cunning.

495
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,000
You're so careless.

496
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,720
How could you be so heartless

497
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,120
and do something evil behind my back?

498
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,760
Senior,

499
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,560
I'm the one who did something evil behind your back.

500
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,200
Don't misunderstand Sister Zhong.

501
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,400
She taught you how to deal with people and goods.

502
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,680
She taught you how to deal with people and goods.

503
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,720
You didn't take me away.

504
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,440
It's your fault.

505
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,360
It's none of her business.

506
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,680
You're so stubborn.

507
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,320
You're so shameless.

508
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,600
You're so cold-hearted.

509
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,040
You're so cold-hearted.

510
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,040
You're so cold-hearted.

511
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,880
You're so cold-hearted.

512
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,040
Enough.

513
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,160
Just leave the ink

514
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,480
in your own stomach.

515
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,840
You've got the goods.

516
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,720
What else do you want?

517
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,840
It's all the same.

518
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,280
Our business is not over yet.

519
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,160
You want to avenge your master's old man?

520
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,640
Is that what you're capable of?

521
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,240
How dare you mention it again?

522
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,960
You dare not kill your enemy in front of us.

523
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,240
You're such a loser.

524
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,040
I wish I could kill you now.

525
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,800
But I'm no longer the White Dragon of the Poisonous Valley.

526
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,640
I'm the Chief of the Divine Camp.

527
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,480
We'll find out everything about you.

528
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,600
We'll take you back to the Divine Camp

529
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,600
and make you be punished.

530
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,840
It's too late.

531
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,040
We have to take the fire silk back

532
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,120
and serve it to Senior.

533
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,560
What are you laughing at?

534
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,320
I'm laughing at your master's old man.

535
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,960
He's so bad at taking in his disciple's eyes.

536
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,240
You're such a loser.

537
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,040
You're not saving him.

538
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,040
You're sending him to see the King of Hell.

539
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,720
What do you mean?

540
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,400
The fire silk can cure the poison of the cold.

541
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,720
But the premise of the poison is

542
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,200
that it can't be fought with two poisons.

543
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,920
The poison of the fire silk is so strong.

544
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,480
If it's taken directly,

545
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,280
the cold and heat in its body will be sealed.

546
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,440
Not to mention the poison.

547
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,560
It will be killed in a second.

548
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,760
You're such a loser.

549
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,000
What should we do with the fire silk?

550
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Unless we use special herbs to make fire silk,

551
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,880
it can be released slowly.

552
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,920
The poison of the cold-curing poison

553
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,800
will gradually remove the cold poison.

554
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,000
This is the correct way to detoxify the poison.

555
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,840
Can you make fire silk?

556
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,200
Master Feng Wu,

557
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,600
do you know how to make it?

558
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:08,360
Only I can make fire silk.

559
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,600
How can he know?

560
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,000
Is he telling the truth?

561
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,800
Yes.

562
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,480
Elder,

563
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,600
as long as you're willing to save my senior,

564
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,640
I'm willing to risk my life.

565
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,240
But I can't give you Feng Qingzhuo.

566
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,640
You can take my life as you like.

567
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,880
I'll do as you say.

568
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,160
Xun Man.

569
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:33,960
No.

570
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,240
What?

571
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,480
Why do I want your life?

572
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,080
It's useless.

573
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,480
Actually, I don't need the life of this little white dragon.

574
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,240
From the beginning to the end,

575
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,680
I just want that book.

576
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,600
Yin Yang Book.

577
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,520
Yin Yang Book?

578
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,160
Give me the book.

579
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,600
I can help you make fire silk.

580
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,440
I can't give you the book.

581
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,280
Then he'll wait to die.

582
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,600
If you don't teach us how to make fire silk,

583
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,000
you'll die soon.

584
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,160
Girl,

585
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,360
if you kill me,

586
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,520
no one will save her life.

587
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,520
Old bastard wants to provoke a fight.

588
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,280
But he doesn't know what we've been through together.

589
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,080
If you're a bad guy,

590
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,400
I've died countless times with my senior.

591
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,280
How can I doubt my trusted friend

592
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,880
just because of his words?

593
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,440
But I'm from the Poisonous Valley.

594
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,600
Is it important?

595
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,200
Before we canHuhua,

596
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,120
we must present the case as a clean judgment.

597
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,200
This technique

598
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,680
needs attention and consideration.

599
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,600
About your identity,

600
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,280
Did you tell them?

601
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,040
There's no good person

602
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,040
who came out of the valley.

603
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,760
Aren't you a good person?

604
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,040
I'll give it to you.

605
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,680
This is your master's relic.

606
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,040
The book is a dead thing.

607
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,160
If I let my friend's life

608
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,560
be in danger because of a book,

609
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,880
I, Feng Xingzhuo,

610
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,640
don't deserve to be a doctor

611
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,200
to exchange my friend's life for a book.

612
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,160
I'm sorry.

613
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,760
I'm sorry.

614
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,240
I'm sorry.

615
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,240
I'm sorry.

616
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,080
I'm sorry.

617
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,520
Give me the book.

618
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,800
I can make firewood for you right now.

619
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,800
I can do it.

620
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:24,800
Give it to me.

621
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,720
Give it to me.

622
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,000
Come here.

623
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,200
Give it to me.

624
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,280
What are you doing?

625
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,560
Are you crazy?

626
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,160
Fire.

627
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,640
Fire.

628
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,080
I know you best.

629
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,120
I'll give you half of it.

630
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,360
After you read it,

631
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,240
I'll give you the other half.

632
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,000
Give it to me.

633
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Give it to me.

634
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Give it to me.

635
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Give it to me.

636
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Right.

637
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,040
It should be fine.

638
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,120
Although Old Chou has done many evil deeds,

639
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,800
he has the ability to make medicine.

640
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,200
I've been watching him all the way.

641
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,400
He didn't do anything.

642
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,840
Except for this antidote,

643
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,440
you have no other ways.

644
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,160
Why don't you give it a try?

645
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,440
Master, are you at my house?

646
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,840
Am I a sea tiger?

647
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,360
What happened to the sea?

648
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,440
Who is Ye Sha?

649
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,440
Master.

650
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,640
I don't have much time.

651
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,840
Say something, master.

652
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,840
Master.

653
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,840
Master.

654
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,240
All the villagers in the sea are Ye Sha.

655
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,440
As long as there is one survivor,

656
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,240
there is one breath.

657
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,240
Ye Sha will appear without a leader.

658
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,240
Including you.

659
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,240
The bear is a god.

660
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,640
It's the belief and light of all the sea people who are still alive.

661
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,040
He will never die.

662
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,040
I'm sorry.

663
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,040
I'm sorry.

664
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,040
I'm sorry.

665
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,040
I'm sorry.

666
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,040
I'm sorry.

667
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,240
If he doesn't die,

668
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,240
he will take us to live.

669
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,840
Until he can't pay the price of medicine.

670
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,240
Until all the sea people are avenged.

671
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,240
Brother Xiao.

672
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,640
Brother.

673
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,640
Brother.

674
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,640
Brother Xiao.

675
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,240
Be careful.

676
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,240
Brother.

677
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,240
Be careful, Brother Xiao.

678
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,240
I don't feel so cold.

679
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,440
Crazy.

680
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,440
You are so smart.

681
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,440
Great.

682
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,840
You are going to cure the medicine?

683
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,640
Not me.

684
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,240
It's him.

685
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,640
We have some fate.

686
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,440
Senior.

687
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,440
You must be tired.

688
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,440
But you are now concerned about a very important case.

689
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,040
Before the case is investigated,

690
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,440
you can only suffer.

691
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,240
We agreed to let me go after you were cured.

692
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,840
Now you are not lucky.

693
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,240
You people.

694
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,640
You don't trust me at all.

695
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,240
Forget it.

696
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,640
I don't care about you.

697
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,040
Tell me.

698
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,640
What case?

699
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,840
Ye Sha's case.

700
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,040
Ye Sha.

701
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,840
You are Ye Sha.

702
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,840
No one knows.

703
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,040
You are Ye Sha.

704
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,440
You even ask me.

705
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,840
What a joke.

706
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,840
Senior.

707
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,840
If you talk like this,

708
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,440
I'm afraid it's hard to leave.

709
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,440
My brother has found a lot of evidence

710
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,240
about you and Ye Sha.

711
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,840
You should tell me the truth.

712
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,240
So you won't suffer.

713
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,240
Even if I have evidence,

714
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,440
what can you do to me?

715
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,840
Hand me over to the government?

716
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,440
Then I will continue to point out Xiao Beiming.

717
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,240
Or you have the courage to kill me now.

718
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,040
We won't kill you.

719
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,840
We have our own way.

720
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,440
What do you want?

721
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,640
The reputation of the old smelly bug

722
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,840
is known in the world.

723
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,240
You hurt many people and many enemies.

724
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,840
You don't know it yourself, do you?

725
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,240
As long as we spread your news,

726
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,040
you will die in less than two days.

727
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,840
And you will die a terrible death.

728
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,840
You are shameless.

729
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,840
Master said

730
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,640
we should treat people in any way.

731
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,640
Your master can't think of such a stupid way.

732
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,440
You are learning from them.

733
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,640
Stop talking nonsense.

734
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,840
You are not Yin Yang Ce.

735
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,440
As long as you tell us the news of Ye Sha,

736
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,840
I can not only guarantee your safety,

737
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,640
but also give you the half of Yin Yang Ce.

738
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,840
Brother, I tell you,

739
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,240
I only tell you one thing.

740
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,240
Okay.

741
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,240
Feng,

742
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,640
it's too dangerous for you to be with him alone.

743
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,240
Don't worry. He can't do anything to me.

744
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,040
You don't know martial arts?

745
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,440
He is trapped.

746
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,240
He is poisoned.

747
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,040
Don't worry.

748
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,040
Tong Shao,

749
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,840
leave Feng Jun Zhuo alone.

750
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,240
Brother,

751
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,640
come.

752
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,640
We have prepared a lot of food.

753
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,440
These days, for Brother Xiao's illness,

754
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,840
we didn't have a good meal.

755
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,240
Sit down and eat something.

756
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,640
Thank you, Miss Hu.

757
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,240
Actually, I wanted to see you again.

758
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,040
But he suddenly fell ill.

759
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,440
You want to say that?

760
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,240
Zhong Bu Kui has told me.

761
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,440
It's all over. Don't worry.

762
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,640
Where is Feng Wu?

763
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,440
Lao Zhou Rong wants to talk to him alone.

764
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,240
Don't worry.

765
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,640
Nothing will happen.

766
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,240
I'll go up and see them.

767
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,240
Don't worry.

768
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,240
It's okay.

769
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,040
What you want to know the most

770
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,840
is how your master died.

771
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,240
You killed him.

772
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,240
You lost to my master in the contest of the Valley Master Competition.

773
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,640
You were poisoned.

774
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,840
My master not only killed you,

775
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,240
but also saved your life.

776
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,040
He was so cruel

777
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,440
that he killed my master

778
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,040
for the Yin Yang Book.

779
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,240
You think I killed him because of the Yin Yang Book?

780
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,440
Isn't it?

781
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,640
In the Valley of Poison,

782
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,640
the same sect poisoned each other.

783
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,640
It's the rule in the Valley.

784
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,240
Whoever is poisoned by the other party,

785
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,640
will be uneducated.

786
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,040
Only you pretend to be the sage

787
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,240
and pretend to be a hypocrite,

788
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,840
only learn how to detoxify.

789
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,840
Since your master became the Valley Master,

790
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,840
the same sect has been banned from detoxifying.

791
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,440
Since then,

792
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,640
the Valley of Poison has become

793
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,840
a weak person like you and your master.

794
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,840
How can the Valley of Poison still protect this world?

795
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,040
My master's kindness

796
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,840
became the reason for your killing him.

797
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,840
You're a fool.

798
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,840
You really don't know what you're doing.

799
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,840
Cut the crap.

800
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,840
Tell me.

801
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,840
How did you poison him?

802
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,840
Ice Star Grass.

803
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,840
Ice Star Grass?

804
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,040
I can detoxify the poison of Ice Star Grass.

805
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,040
How could my master be poisoned to death?

806
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,040
It's funny.

807
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,640
You're a coroner now.

808
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,040
But at that time,

809
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:43,040
you couldn't bear to poison your master.

810
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,440
You've been following your master since you were a priest.

811
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,240
I've poisoned him countless times since I was a child.

812
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,040
Have I ever hurt him?

813
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,640
I gave him Ice Star Grass.

814
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,440
He's not different from the one who usually fights with him.

815
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,640
But I didn't expect him to die.

816
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,440
Liar.

817
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,640
You never think about it.

818
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,640
If I had the poison that could kill him,

819
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,640
how could I have lost to him in the position of Valley Master?

820
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:05,640
I heard the sound of the flute in the boat.

821
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:12,640
Why should I laugh and cry?

822
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,640
I'm trapped in my heart for a long time.

823
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:20,640
I'm as lonely as the sky.

824
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,640
I can't get over the feeling of being with you.

825
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,640
Who can understand?

826
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:33,640
I'm afraid that I'm the only one who can see the bright future.

827
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:44,640
I'm the only one who can see the bright future.
