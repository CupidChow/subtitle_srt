3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,000
Whether the wind will defend the spring

4
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:25,420
I am gonna give up

Episode 13

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,200
Are you eating now or not?

9
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,520
I'm the scrusher of this bombshell...

10
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,640
You made it for me.

11
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,920
In the bombshell area,

12
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:16,700
the

13
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,240
Pokemon

Redmon

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,280
Then don't dream.

19
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,120
I can give you the Yin Yang Book.

20
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,040
But before the investigation of the Ye's case,

21
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,680
we can't let you go.

22
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,240
Then kill me.

23
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,800
Once I die, you'll be avenged.

24
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,000
But I'm afraid you'll never

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,120
find out what you want to know.

26
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,160
Come and eat.

27
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,880
Brother, I let the old snake bug go.

28
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,160
Let it go?

29
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,400
Why?

30
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,800
Are you crazy?

31
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,640
It's related to the Night Fiend.

32
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,160
What if you let it go?

33
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,960
It's related to the Night Fiend.

34
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,000
That's why I let it go.

35
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,440
The clue of the old snake bug's Night Fiend is threatening you.

36
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,080
I can tell you one thing.

37
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,160
I've seen the Night Fiend.

38
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,880
How about it?

39
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,160
Dare you make this deal?

40
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,800
It's hard to catch it back

41
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,080
after you let it go.

42
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,800
What about your master's revenge?

43
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,000
Let the old snake bug come back.

44
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,920
It's really what I wanted to do the most.

45
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,840
But now,

46
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,160
compared to my master's revenge,

47
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,160
some people and things

48
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,680
are more dangerous.

49
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,880
I'm afraid you'll never find out what you want to do.

50
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,360
It's very important.

51
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,160
What's your relationship with the Night Fiend?

52
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,160
Actually, I have nothing to do with it.

53
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,280
If I have,

54
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,560
it's just a master-villager relationship.

55
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,080
Why are you here?

56
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,880
I have a new mission.

57
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,960
It's me who it's me who found

58
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,960
and I'll make a poison for it.

59
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,400
You know,

60
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,560
I'm most interested in this kind of thing.

61
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,840
You know it?

62
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,360
I don't know it.

63
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,760
You've seen it before.

64
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,960
It's just a mask.

65
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,560
I can't see the real face.

66
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,760
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,120
But the old snake bug

68
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,080
still provided some clues about the Night Fiend.

69
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,560
Although it's a cover-up,

70
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,360
it looks like it's a young man.

71
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,360
And there's a black mole on its right eye.

72
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,960
Will it help you?

73
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,160
It says it's a young man.

74
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,760
Zhu Yitian said it's an old man.

75
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,760
Qingying said the Night Fiend was always with him.

76
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,160
Now the old snake bug says it's a young man.

77
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,560
How many Night Fiends are there?

78
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,360
The only clue we can find now is

79
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,760
there's a mole on the eye of the Night Fiend.

80
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,760
But Daqi is so big.

81
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,760
If we want to find a mole,

82
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,560
we have to find the Monkey King.

83
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,360
What else did the old snake bug say?

84
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,360
The black mole.

85
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,160
It found me

86
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,960
and I'll make a poison for it.

87
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,560
It said it wanted a poison

88
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,760
that won't be easily detected.

89
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,160
It's long-lasting.

90
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,960
It will cause hallucinations,

91
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,160
until death do you part.

92
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,960
I've been thinking about it.

93
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,360
I think only the black mole is the best.

94
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,760
The Yin-Yang Book does record the black mole.

95
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,960
But it never records how to make it.

96
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,160
How did you do it?

97
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,560
I and your master know

98
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,360
how to make the black mole.

99
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,960
But the Yin-Yang Book doesn't record it.

100
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,160
Your master, Wei Shan,

101
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,760
secretly drew it.

102
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,560
Your master thought

103
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,160
the black mole was too cruel.

104
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,560
He didn't want this method to be spread.

105
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,760
Luckily, I remember it.

106
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,160
Otherwise,

107
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,960
such a good thing as the black mole

108
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,760
would be lost.

109
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,960
What is the black mole?

110
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,160
The black mole

111
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,760
is made from a rare mineral

112
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,160
called red-medicine.

113
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,760
It's made from a special method.

114
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,560
It's not hard to find the red-medicine.

115
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,960
The hard part is

116
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,560
finding the cause of the medicine.

117
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,360
What cause?

118
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,160
Even a little bit of black mole

119
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,560
needs a lot of oil and living blood

120
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,560
to make it.

121
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,160
Oil and living blood?

122
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,160
Yes.

123
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,760
I've figured out

124
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,360
all the methods of making the material.

125
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,960
I didn't expect

126
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,160
he could make the black mole.

127
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,760
He's really a black mole.

128
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,560
So many black moles.

129
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,560
I don't know how many people he killed.

130
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,760
Such a cruel way of making the poison.

131
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,560
No matter how many black moles there are,

132
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,160
old or young,

133
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,160
we must catch him as soon as possible.

134
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,160
Otherwise, more innocent people will die.

135
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,160
Old Chou just mentioned another clue.

136
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,160
What?

137
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,360
The red-medicine.

138
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,960
Since it's rare,

139
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,160
it must be rare.

140
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,560
We can start from here.

141
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,960
It shouldn't be difficult.

142
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,960
I'll go find it now.

143
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,960
Be careful.

144
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,760
Let's eat first.

145
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,160
Xiao Bailong.

146
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,560
You haven't finished yet.

147
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,360
You're going to tell my artist, right?

148
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,960
There's something.

149
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,760
I didn't tell Zhong Mokui and others.

150
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,160
My illness.

151
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,360
How did you know?

152
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,560
Actually, the fire silk

153
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,160
can't cure Ning Xuehan's poison.

154
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,960
Right?

155
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,760
Xiao Bei Ming's poison

156
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,160
didn't cure at all.

157
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,360
Didn't cure?

158
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,760
Impossible.

159
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,160
You lied to me.

160
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,760
You're a fool.

161
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,960
You think you can cure him

162
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,160
by using the poison?

163
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,160
That's just a little bit of

164
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,160
his vitality.

165
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,560
If you don't believe it,

166
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,960
you can see his arm.

167
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,760
There must be a blue blood stain.

168
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,960
Because the poison

169
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,560
has entered his veins.

170
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,960
The blue blood stain

171
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,560
will gradually change and expand.

172
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,160
Once it turns black,

173
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,960
it will fill the whole arm.

174
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,960
His death will come.

175
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,960
He will live for at most one month.

176
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,160
Why?

177
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,160
You lied to me.

178
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,760
I didn't lie to you.

179
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,760
Think about it.

180
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,960
Your master spent his life on detoxification.

181
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,560
He developed

182
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,560
a poison called Ning Xuehan.

183
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,160
A poison that even I don't know.

184
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,160
Do you think

185
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,960
the small fire silk can cure it?

186
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,960
You underestimate your master.

187
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,960
Actually, he won't die.

188
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,160
Give me the medicine.

189
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,760
Then let me go.

190
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,160
Let me go back and study it.

191
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,560
Maybe I can find a way to detoxify

192
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,360
before he dies.

193
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,760
But I've already read the Yin Yang Book countless times.

194
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,160
If it works, I would have used it long ago.

195
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,360
That's because you're stupid.

196
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,360
With your talent,

197
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,360
even if you copy the Yin Yang Book,

198
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,960
you can only close three doors.

199
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,760
That book is a piece of cake to you.

200
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,360
But I'm different from you.

201
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,760
Even if you can find a cure,

202
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,560
I won't let you go so easily.

203
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,960
Who knows if you'll

204
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,760
expose Brother Xiao's whereabouts?

205
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:24,960
I promise

206
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,560
I won't tell anyone about his whereabouts.

207
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,760
Although I've done countless crimes,

208
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,760
I'm a man of character.

209
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,560
I'm a man of character.

210
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,760
How about it?

211
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,360
Do you dare to read it?

212
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,160
You put the old bug

213
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,360
for the clue of the night killing.

214
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,960
But it's actually for me.

215
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,760
Even if I can't find the clue of the night killing,

216
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,360
you and Zhong Bu Kui can also investigate it.

217
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,760
How could I

218
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,160
let him go without your consent?

219
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,160
This blood is much more

220
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,960
serious than I thought.

221
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,960
It's been a month.

222
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,360
Brother Xiao.

223
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,360
I'm sorry.

224
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,360
I'm sorry.

225
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,360
I shouldn't have found the match.

226
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,360
I wasted so much time on you.

227
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,360
I'm sorry.

228
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,560
Don't say that.

229
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,760
If you hadn't found the match,

230
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,760
I'm afraid I wouldn't have been able to

231
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,760
live for another few days.

232
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,760
But I still can't cure you.

233
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,760
All right,

234
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,160
Little White Dragon.

235
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,760
Little White Dragon.

236
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,960
I should thank you

237
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,160
for finding the antidote for me

238
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,360
and keeping it a secret from me.

239
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,960
You didn't tell me about this

240
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,360
to your sister and your classmate.

241
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,360
If they found out about it,

242
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,560
they would have been

243
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,560
involved in some case

244
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,960
and I would have been involved in it.

245
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,960
It's been a month.

246
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,360
You still want to investigate?

247
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,960
I remember you once told me

248
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,560
that you are a warrior.

249
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,760
Even if you have a knife on your neck,

250
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,160
you won't let go

251
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,760
of the knife in your hand.

252
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,560
Do you remember the first time we met?

253
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,960
The whole world thinks

254
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,960
you are the only Little White Dragon

255
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,160
who kills people for a reason.

256
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,960
But only you know

257
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,960
that you are just a

258
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,760
unbearable doctor who can't be saved.

259
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:23,960
Everyone in the world

260
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,160
thinks I'm Ye Shao.

261
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,960
But only I know that

262
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,560
I'm just a

263
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,160
scapegoat who wants to find out the truth.

264
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,560
Even if I die,

265
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,360
I will die on the way to investigate.

266
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,360
This is the life of Xiao Beiming.

267
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,160
All right.

268
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,160
Senior, sit down.

269
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,160
What's wrong?

270
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,760
We found the clue to the drug-eating stone.

271
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,960
Let's go.

272
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,360
It's Africa again.

273
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,160
That's right.

274
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,360
The drug-eating stone is only in Africa.

275
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,160
There is a mine

276
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,160
of drug-eating stone there.

277
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,960
But the production is extremely rare.

278
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,760
If the stone

279
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,160
is really made from the drug-eating stone,

280
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,960
then we can find the clue to Ye Shao

281
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,960
in Africa.

282
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,360
There is also a large sum of money

283
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,760
in the previous book of Chou Guang Sha.

284
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,160
It's all in Africa.

285
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,360
It's all in Africa.

286
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,560
There is also a large sum of money

287
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,760
in the previous book of Chou Guang Sha.

288
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,360
It's time to go to Africa.

289
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,760
Let's pack up and go.

290
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,360
Tong Shuang,

291
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:20,960
what's wrong with him?

292
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,760
I'll take you to Africa.

293
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,160
I'm from Africa.

294
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,960
You're from Africa?

295
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,760
I've never heard you

296
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,160
mention your hometown.

297
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,960
That's right.

298
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,360
You must have not been home for a long time.

299
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,360
You can go home this time

300
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,160
to see your family.

301
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,960
I don't know where I want to go.

302
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,360
That sounds optimistic.

303
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,560
Why isn't she home yet?

304
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,160
The meeting is late.

305
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,000
Could we just wait a little longer

306
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,360
before someone livens up further?

307
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,160
What is going to happen in the next few hours?

308
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,560
Blood.

309
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,560
Lie.

310
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,560
What will happen next?

311
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,560
Black- excel.

312
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,160
I didn't mean to remind you of what happened before.

313
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,160
It's fine. It's been so long.

314
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,560
Then how did you know my senior?

315
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,960
I knew that if the enemy found out that I was still alive,

316
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,760
I would die.

317
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,760
So I escaped from Weizhou and wandered the world.

318
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,960
I was then manipulated by a black-hearted mute

319
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,560
and was sold to the border.

320
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,960
I was tortured.

321
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,960
Fortunately, I met my brother later.

322
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,560
So I followed him since then.

323
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,560
He became my only family.

324
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,760
The three years I escaped,

325
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,560
the government and the people who wanted to reward me were looking for me.

326
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,560
If it weren't for Tong Shuang,

327
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,960
I wouldn't be able to stand in front of you now.

328
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,760
In order to cover up for me,

329
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,560
he has been injured a lot.

330
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,760
It's all in the past.

331
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,360
Look at us.

332
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,360
We're both fine, right?

333
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,160
You haven't been back since you left Weizhou, right?

334
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,360
You should go back this time to say goodbye to your family.

335
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,360
Yes, let's go.

336
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,160
It takes several days to get to Weizhou.

337
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,360
Let's pack up now.

338
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,160
No, this trip is important.

339
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,560
You have to be fully prepared. You don't have to be so anxious.

340
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,960
I...

341
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,160
I'm just afraid of having a long night.

342
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,360
That's true, but we have to pack up first.

343
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,960
Let's set off early tomorrow morning.

344
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,560
Junior, you and Feng Jinzhuo and Tong Shuang

345
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,160
are both the political subordinates of Shen Buying.

346
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,560
If you want to leave the capital and go to another place,

347
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,160
you have to find a good reason.

348
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,960
Otherwise, you will be punished for being unable to do your duty.

349
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,560
I have an idea to go to Weizhou.

350
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,760
Shen Buying bought ten horses from the outside.

351
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,360
The horse was transported to Weizhou and got sick.

352
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,960
Ten horses were trapped in Weizhou and needed Shen Buying

353
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,760
to send someone to transport the horse back.

354
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,960
You mean...

355
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,560
He's self-made and crazy.

356
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,360
Is there any problem with saying he can transport the horse?

357
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,360
Me?

358
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,560
Yes, of course there is no problem.

359
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,760
But this is a very dirty and difficult task.

360
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,560
Shen Buying and everyone else are in a hurry.

361
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,760
You guys take the initiative to win.

362
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,760
Fang Tianzhen will suspect you instead.

363
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,160
I...

364
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,760
have an idea.

365
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,960
Look at me.

366
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,560
I'm a general with a big face.

367
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,360
I look like a fat man again.

368
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,960
I look so good.

369
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,360
Come on, call him General with a big face.

370
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,560
Okay.

371
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,760
General with a big face is really good.

372
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,760
Okay?

373
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,560
Are you stupid?

374
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,360
Song Xue Man?

375
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,760
I'm here, but I don't want to talk.

376
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,160
Song Xue Man, what are you doing?

377
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,760
The one who made trouble near Shen Buying

378
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,560
was your creditor, right?

379
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,160
Who are you?

380
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,360
I remember someone reminded you before.

381
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,360
If you keep gambling, you'll break your legs.

382
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,360
It seems you're really not afraid of the water.

383
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,560
You're happy to throw our Shen Buying's face in, right?

384
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
Yes.

385
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,160
Someone reminded me before.

386
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,360
But that person has thrown our Shen Buying's face in.

387
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,160
General with a big face,

388
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,560
since you're so capable,

389
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,160
why do you want to be my friend?

390
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,360
Why don't you go catch him?

391
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,360
He's your husband.

392
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,360
What are you doing?

393
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,760
Why did you scare me?

394
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,960
Calm down.

395
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,360
Song Xue Man, are you still scared of me?

396
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,360
You're so arrogant, right?

397
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,360
You hit me. Don't come out.

398
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,560
Stop it.

399
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,760
Uncle.

400
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,960
Uncle, he hit me.

401
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,560
He hit me again.

402
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,960
Shut up.

403
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,760
Come with me.

404
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,360
Song Xue Man, can you let me calm down for a few days?

405
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,160
Is it that hard for you to calm down?

406
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,960
If it wasn't for your father,

407
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,960
I can endure you until now.

408
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,360
You knelt down and begged me to investigate Feng Shi.

409
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,760
How did it go?

410
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,760
The murderer disappeared without any evidence.

411
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,960
He made a false claim to An Zhen Ying for nothing.

412
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,560
I even put in a pig's blood.

413
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,560
It's okay that there's no news so far.

414
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,160
I'll let it go.

415
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,160
And then,

416
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,760
you secretly communicated with An Zhen Ying behind my back.

417
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:01,160
I also tolerated the emergency cooperation with that Zhuge Kongyun.

418
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,360
Now, the Huo Fu case is exposed.

419
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,160
You don't tell me anything.

420
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,760
Zhong Pugui, you don't take Shen Buying seriously.

421
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,960
You don't take me seriously.

422
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,360
The Huo Fu case involves Ye Sha.

423
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,960
It's an An Zhen Ying case.

424
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,360
According to the law, I can't reveal it to you.

425
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,360
If you want to know the case, you can go to An Zhen Ying and ask.

426
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,560
Okay.

427
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,160
Good answer.

428
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,560
It seems that I, Shen Buying,

429
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,160
can't tolerate Zhong Pugui, the great Buddha.

430
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,560
Then you can go.

431
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,560
I'm just investigating the case.

432
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,960
And even if I go,

433
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,560
I shouldn't go.

434
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,760
It's my turn.

435
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,560
You go.

436
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,160
I dare not.

437
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,960
Since you don't want to go,

438
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,160
I can stop working with An Zhen Ying.

439
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,360
What do you want me to do?

440
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,760
Go to the street?

441
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,160
Go to see the corpse?

442
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,560
Or go to gamble and bet money?

443
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,760
Okay, I understand.

444
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,160
You think you have no intention to show your body.

445
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,560
I'll send you a soldier.

446
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,160
I'll send you a soldier.

447
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,160
There's a sick case in Weizhou.

448
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,160
You go there.

449
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,760
Find out the past.

450
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,160
Don't come back.

451
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,960
Do you think you're useless again?

452
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,560
It's better to be born and die with An Zhen Ying.

453
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,760
So dignified.

454
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,960
It's okay.

455
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,560
You take off that waistband.

456
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,960
You take off your uniform.

457
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,960
An Zhen Ying is a spy.

458
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,760
I can go to Weizhou.

459
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,160
But the road is long.

460
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,560
I need help.

461
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,160
Tong Bukuan.

462
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,360
He's from Weizhou.

463
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,960
He can help.

464
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,760
A woman can help.

465
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,160
I want them two to accompany me.

466
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,960
You're good at picking people.

467
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,360
I'm tired of picking these two.

468
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,760
Take them to Weizhou.

469
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,360
Before you find out,

470
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,360
don't let me see you three in Beijing.

471
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,160
Yes.

472
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,760
I'm sorry.

473
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,160
I'm sorry.

474
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,560
I'm sorry.

475
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,160
I'm sorry.

476
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,960
I'm sorry.

477
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,560
I'm sorry.

478
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,160
I'm sorry.

479
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,960
I'm sorry.

480
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,560
I'm sorry.

481
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,360
I'm sorry.

482
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,160
I'm sorry.

483
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,760
I'm sorry.

484
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,760
I'm sorry.

485
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,560
I'm sorry.

486
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,560
I'm sorry.

487
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,360
I'm sorry.

488
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,160
I'm sorry.

489
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,960
I'm sorry.

490
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,560
I... I just passed by.

491
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,960
I remember you said

492
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,560
you had dismissed all your servants.

493
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,760
I guess you haven't had dinner yet.

494
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,960
It's hot.

495
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,760
I'm leaving.

496
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,360
Tong Bukuan.

497
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,760
Tong Bukuan.

498
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,360
Tong Bukuan.

499
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,760
Tong Bukuan.

500
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,160
Tong Bukuan.

501
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,560
Tong Bukuan.

502
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,360
Tong Bukuan.

503
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,960
Tong Bukuan.

504
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,760
Tong Bukuan.

505
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,360
Tong Bukuan.

506
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,760
Mr. Feng.

507
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,160
Can you walk with me?

508
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:39,160
The breeze is gentle and the moon is bright.

509
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:46,560
It's the most profound vow.

510
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,960
The star and the starlight are not as beautiful as you.

511
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,160
Miss Huo.

512
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,960
The years are in a mess.

513
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,360
What's wrong?

514
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,360
The colors are changing.

515
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,160
Memories are written in the book.

516
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,560
They are passed on to us.

517
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,360
The small scenes

518
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,560
become a love story.

519
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,160
It's okay.

520
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:22,360
If time can stay forever,

521
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:29,760
I'll stay by your side for a few years.

522
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:36,560
How can I hide my longing?

523
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,360
If the heart is not free,

524
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:43,160
I'll be a man forever.

525
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:50,360
Love never changes.

526
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:55,360
Love never changes.

527
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:02,160
The wind is gentle and the moon is bright.

528
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:09,160
It's the most profound vow.

529
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:15,560
The stars are in a mess.

530
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:20,160
The moon is bright.

531
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,360
The moon is bright.

532
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,360
I...

533
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,160
Junior.

534
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,160
Sit.

535
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,760
What's this?

536
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,360
I saw you were weak and coughed after the poison was cured.

537
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,760
So I asked Feng Wu.

538
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,360
He said you were sick and needed some tonic.

539
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,360
So I made some soup.

540
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,560
Drink it while it's hot.

541
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,560
Thank you, Junior.

542
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,360
Fang Lian Zheng ate a lot today.

543
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,960
He didn't sleep at night.

544
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,160
Even if he fell asleep,

545
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,760
you're the only one in his dream.

546
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,760
What can I do?

547
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,560
I have to make him feel wronged.

548
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,960
I'll apologize to him later.

549
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,560
Are you happy?

550
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,360
I'm happy.

551
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,360
I'm happy.

552
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,360
I'm happy.

553
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,560
I'm happy.

554
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,560
I'm happy.

555
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,560
I'm happy.

556
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,560
I'm happy.

557
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,560
I'm happy.

558
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,560
I'm happy.

559
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,760
Your poison

560
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,960
has cleared a big worry of mine.

561
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,360
No matter the trip to Weizhou goes well or not,

562
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,560
as long as we have enough time,

563
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,760
we can help you with the proposal.

564
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,960
Of course I'm happy.

565
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,360
Senior.

566
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,160
Are you worried about something?

567
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,360
No.

568
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,560
I'm just worried about this trip to Weizhou.

569
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,760
Why are you worried about this?

570
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,960
Maybe we can catch Ye Sha this time.

571
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,160
But the more we investigate,

572
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,960
the more we find that Ye Sha is scary.

573
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,160
We don't know how many lives

574
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,760
are in Ming Lian's case.

575
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,160
And we don't know how many people

576
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,560
will lose their lives

577
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,560
because of him in the future.

578
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,760
So we must catch him as soon as possible.

579
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,360
Let's hope so.

580
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,360
Not hope.

581
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,360
It's a must.

582
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,160
I'm the third son of the Weizhou Plain Escort.

583
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,560
I know that escort.

584
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,560
They were...

585
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,160
Yes, they were killed.

586
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,160
Ten years ago,

587
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,760
at the Mid-Autumn Festival,

588
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,160
the enemy poisoned us.

589
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,360
It was a big fire overnight.

590
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,160
74 people died in the escort.

591
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,960
I didn't go home after the party.

592
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,360
I was in danger.

593
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,360
I was so scared.

594
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,560
I was so scared.

595
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,960
I was so scared.

596
00:27:50,400 --> 00:28:02,840
Did you find a ammunition bow

597
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,320
all this time?

598
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,360
You will call yourself

599
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,720
Please don't.

600
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,200
I'm sorry.

601
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,000
Miss Huo said she was leaving the capital.

602
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,600
She said it herself.

603
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,160
Huo Huo had such a big change.

604
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,120
She probably wants to leave the Sad Land, too.

605
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,520
Did she say where she went?

606
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,600
I'm just worried about her.

607
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,640
She's a girl.

608
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,600
What if...

609
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,960
She has General Huo's huge property in Bangshan.

610
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,800
And she's smart enough.

611
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,480
You don't have to worry about her.

612
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:44,200
But it would do to impress and場

613
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:48,840
Miss Huo.

614
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,320
Wait for us?

615
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,040
Are you here to say goodbye?

616
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,080
I want to go to Weizhou with you.

617
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,440
Why do you go to Weizhou?

618
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,480
I really want to know

619
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,480
what's going on in the sea.

620
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,760
I want to find out my identity.

621
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,400
I also want to know

622
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,280
who my biological parents are.

623
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,760
This is a big issue.

624
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,160
You should be more cautious.

625
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:13,880
How about this?

626
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,960
You go home and wait.

627
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,080
We'll go find out the truth.

628
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,080
I'll tell you.

629
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,080
I'll go with you.

630
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,240
I don't have a home.

631
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,320
My father died.

632
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,960
My mother died.

633
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,680
My sister-in-law died.

634
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,400
Everyone is gone.

635
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,680
I finally met your mother.

636
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,920
Now you're leaving.

637
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,800
I was an orphan when I came here.

638
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,800
I'm still alone now.

639
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,080
I'm happy.

640
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,760
I can go there myself.

641
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,760
I don't care about the danger.

642
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,760
For me now,

643
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,520
there's nothing I can lose.

644
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,960
Thank you for your help

645
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,000
during this time.

646
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,000
I'm very grateful.

647
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,040
Don't mention it.

648
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,160
I'm worried about you going alone.

649
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,560
You should go to Weizhou with us.

650
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,160
I'll go with you.

651
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:29,840
Really?

652
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,080
It's not the first time I bring you to investigate.

653
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,120
Why are you still standing there?

654
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,240
Put his luggage

655
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,520
on our carriage.

656
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,160
I'll go help him.

657
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,160
Let him come with us?

658
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,440
We can let our sister-in-law have a way.

659
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,440
What about her?

660
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,160
What does she have to do with the lunatic?

661
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,440
Don't ask if you shouldn't.

662
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,080
Let's go.

663
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,040
You brought so many boxes.

664
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,160
What's inside?

665
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,280
Clothes,

666
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,480
rouge and powder.

667
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,240
Why do you bring these

668
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,360
instead of guns?

669
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,040
For beauty.

670
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,960
We're going to investigate.

671
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,640
It's as beautiful as the investigation.

672
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,920
I regret wearing it.

673
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,160
Let's have some food.

674
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,360
Miss Huo,

675
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,560
I'll get it.

676
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,040
Brother Lei.

677
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,960
What do you eat

678
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,320
if you don't eat food?

679
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,880
You came out with my brother.

680
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,720
You don't need to eat that junk food.

681
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,600
Wait a minute.

682
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,640
There's a limit to the conditions here.

683
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,960
I'll give you a little leak.

684
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,600
I remember you were in the interrogation camp before.

685
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,960
You never wanted to go into the kitchen.

686
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,240
Now you're...

687
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,680
If I had escaped for three years

688
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,560
and still didn't take Yang Chun Shui,

689
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,880
I would have starved to death.

690
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,920
Brother, look.

691
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,600
I've got a lot of things today.

692
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,760
I'm so full.

693
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,760
I'm full.

694
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,760
I'm full.

695
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,760
I'm full.

696
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,760
I'm full.

697
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,760
I'm full.

698
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,760
I'm full.

699
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,760
I'm full.

700
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,760
I'm full.

701
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,760
I'm full.

702
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,840
Look.

703
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,040
My brother used gauze to wipe his ass.

704
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,120
He leaked it to you.

705
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,040
Tong Shuai,

706
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,920
go and deal with him.

707
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,840
I'll do it.

708
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,600
I have a knife.

709
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,320
It's convenient.

710
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,400
Forget about your knife.

711
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,320
I'm a living legend.

712
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,520
I won't touch this thing with a dead man's knife.

713
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,720
Trust me, brother.

714
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,960
I'll go get some wild vegetables.

715
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:37,960
I'll go with you.

716
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,640
Okay.

717
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,400
Are you and the girl from the Huo family

718
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,000
having something going on?

719
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,800
Don't talk nonsense.

720
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,040
Stop pretending.

721
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,040
I can see it.

722
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,240
What do you see?

723
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,520
Look at his eyes.

724
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,760
They're exactly the same as your body.

725
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,760
They have light in their eyes.

726
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,760
Do you want to see it?

727
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,520
I think you have some light too.

728
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,640
Why are you pointing at me?

729
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,440
What's going on?

730
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,440
Go up there.

731
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,280
You're starting to act.

732
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,640
Thank you.

733
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,520
For what?

734
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,760
Thank you for allowing me to go to Weizhou with you.

735
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,880
And for letting me know that I'm not alone.

736
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,880
I have friends.

737
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,040
Come on.

738
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,880
Let's drink to celebrate.

739
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,840
We have to get going tomorrow.

740
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,760
You're so heartless.

741
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,760
When are you going to be happy?

742
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,680
Of course.

743
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,840
My brother is going to be a read-out.

744
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,080
Of course we have to celebrate.

745
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,080
Right, brother?

746
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,080
Come on.

747
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,080
Come on.

748
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,680
I'll drink.

749
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,680
You guys can drink as you like.

750
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,680
Cheers.

751
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,080
Have you ever thought about

752
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,080
what your plans are after you find Ye Sha?

753
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,080
Especially Brother Xiao.

754
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,080
When you clear your suspicion,

755
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,080
restore your position,

756
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,080
and stay in Shen Buying?

757
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,080
I...

758
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,080
I haven't thought about it yet.

759
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,080
Maybe I will.

760
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,080
What about Xue Ma?

761
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,080
I haven't thought about it yet either.

762
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,080
What are you thinking about?

763
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,080
I'm thinking about it.

764
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,080
What are you thinking about?

765
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,080
You don't even have a reason.

766
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,080
You don't even have a mouth.

767
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,080
Finish cleaning first.

768
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,080
What about you guys?

769
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,080
What do you want to do, Mr. Feng?

770
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,080
I still want to catch the old bug.

771
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,080
I'm going to avenge my master.

772
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,080
I want to open a clinic

773
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,080
and live a simple life.

774
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,080
Miss He, what about you?

775
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,080
What do you want to do?

776
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,080
I want to walk around

777
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,080
and see the great river of Qi.

778
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,080
Alone?

779
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,080
Go with her.

780
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,080
Me?

781
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,080
Tong Shuang.

782
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,080
Tong Shuang.

783
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,080
I'm sorry.

784
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,080
I'm sorry.

785
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,080
I'm sorry.

786
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,080
I'm sorry.

787
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,080
I'm sorry.

788
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,080
I'm sorry.

789
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,080
I'm sorry.

790
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,080

00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,080
I'm sorry.

796
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,080
I'm sorry.

797
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,080
I'm sorry.

798
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,080
I'm sorry.

799
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,080
I'm sorry.

800
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,080
I'm sorry.

801
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,080
I'm sorry.

802
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,080
I'm sorry.

803
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,080
I'm sorry.

804
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,080
I'm sorry.

805
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,080

00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,080
I'm sorry.

811
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,080
I'm sorry.

812
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,080
I'm sorry.

813
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,080
I'm sorry.

814
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,080
I'm sorry.

815
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,080
I'm sorry.

816
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,080
I'm sorry.

817
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,080
I'm sorry.

818
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,080
I'm sorry.

819
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,080
I'm sorry.

820
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,080
I'm sorry.

821
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,080
I'm sorry.

822
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,080
I'm sorry.

823
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,080
I'm sorry.

824
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,080
I'm sorry.

825
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,080
I'm sorry.

826
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,080
I'm sorry.

827
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,080
I'm sorry.

828
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,080
I'm sorry.

829
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,080

832
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,080
I'm sorry.

833
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,080
I'm sorry.

834
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,080
I'm sorry.

835
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,080
I'm sorry.

836
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,080
I'm sorry.

837
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,080
I'm sorry.

838
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,080
I'm sorry.

839
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,080
I'm sorry.

840
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,080
I'm sorry.

841
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,580
I'm sorry.

842
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,580
I'm sorry.

843
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,580
I'm sorry.

844
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,580
I'm sorry.

845
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,580
I'm sorry.

846
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,580
I'm sorry.

847
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,580
I'm sorry.

848
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,580
This is

849
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,580
the old cop office,

850
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,580
where I was once.

851
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,080
After the fire broke out,

852
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,080
no one at home.

853
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,080
But I guess it's clean enough

854
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,080
to live there.

855
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,080
Let's go in and have a look.

856
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,040
The

857
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,040
The

Wherever

Wherever

Wherever

873

Where

Wherever

Where

878
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,040
Where

879
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,040
lightweight

before
