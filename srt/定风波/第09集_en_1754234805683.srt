00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,880
Tears...

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,640
She'll visit you in the morning,

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,360
she'll be home already.

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,840
Tears...

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,980
Blackně

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,400
Tears..

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,200
She'll still be at BOYS D 한국

8
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,800
Tears..

9
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,580
They all time

10
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:19,760
my converting from superhero boy

11
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,040
I'll never remember

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,580
our quarrel

13
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,420
It's always like this

14
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:26,520
I will return

15
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,180
all these on arrival

16
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:03,380
I'm going to the

I'm going to the

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,420
I'm going to the

00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,420
I'm going to the

20
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,420
I'm going to the

21
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,420
I'm going to the

22
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,420
I'm going to the

23
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,420
I'm going to the

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,420
I'm going to the

00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,420
I'm going to the

00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,420
I'm going to the

27
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,420
I'm going to the

28
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,420
I'm going to the

29
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,420
I'm going to the

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,420
I'm going to the

00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,420
I'm going to the

00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,420
I'm going to the

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,420
I'm going to the

34
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,420
I'm going to the

35
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,420
I'm going to draw

36
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,420
I'm sorry

37
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,420
I'm sorry

38
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,420
I'm sorry

39
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,460
Meeting of profit thirty-four thousand

40
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,240
Italy

41
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:13,380
Monitor

42
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,160
The amount

43
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,040
One hundred thousand

44
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:15,800
Taiwan

45
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,580
WoW

46
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,220
No

47
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:18,920
Not

48
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,500
Please

49
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,400
Choose

50
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:21,780

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,060
Choose

52
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,380
He is the one who stole Master's body.

53
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,620
Master Yan, have you found out?

54
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,380
Report to Chief Fang.

55
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,420
The body is not sick.

56
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,980
There is another reason for the death.

57
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,740
Nonsense.

58
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,500
My master died of illness.

59
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,980
Since there is a question,

60
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,100
let's hear what our Feng Wu said.

61
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,300
What do you think?

62
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,380
I am the daughter of Huo Zong Yao, Huo Dai Rong.

63
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,220
According to what Chief Fang said,

64
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,020
I heard the name of Ye Lin first.

65
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,340
I will do what I said.

66
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,420
Let's hear the result of the autopsy first.

67
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,460
If my father is really the murderer,

68
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,380
please make the decision

69
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,820
and find out the truth.

70
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:32,900
Okay.

71
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,140
Please come in.

72
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,540
Let me come in one by one.

73
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,260
You just said that two people stole the body.

74
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,140
That's right.

75
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,660
It's these two people.

76
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,300
Chief.

77
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,300
Chief.

78
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,180
Mo Chong.

79
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,860
You are also playing with Zhong Xue Man here.

80
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,300
I...

81
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,300
I heard that Junior Sister...

82
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,140
Junior Sister, it's good that you are fine.

83
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,100
Feng Wu, tell everyone

84
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,380
the result of the autopsy.

85
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,780
Yes, Chief.

86
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,660
There are scratches on General Huo's neck.

87
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:42,020
It's all your hair loss.

88
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,340
There weren't any body wounds.

89
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,260
Someone wants to disguise General Huo's real death.

90
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,460
But this kind of trick

91
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,060
can't fool our coroner.

92
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,100
General Huo's tongue is black.

93
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,300
Blood at the end of the eye.

94
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,340
These phenomena

95
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,140
show that he died of suffocation.

96
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,500
Plus the scars on General Huo's neck.

97
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,820
He was strangled to death by someone.

98
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,620
Master.

99
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,260
Master.

100
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,340
Master.

101
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,700
Who is the one who wants to harm him?

102
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,180
Now there is evidence that

103
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,580
General Huo died of suffocation.

104
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,580
Do you have any other opinions?

105
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,340
Who is the one who wants to harm him?

106
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,100
Who is the one who wants to harm him?

107
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,900
Madam Huo,

108
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,860
since this is a murder case,

109
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,500
we will investigate it thoroughly

110
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,260
according to the truth.

111
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,940
To get justice for the Huo family.

112
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,340
Thank you, Mr. Zhuge.

113
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,260
Wait.

114
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,980
Don't think that we are just making fun of you.

115
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,740
Investigating a case

116
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,460
is your duty.

117
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,020
But you can't just

118
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,100
let Zhong Xuan Man's crime go.

119
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,020
What do you mean?

120
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,540
You are just making fun of us, aren't you?

121
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,100
This is a two-way thing.

122
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:01,860
What?

123
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,020
You are not going to

124
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,260
publicize the case, are you?

125
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,660
Since this is my case,

126
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,220
then let me and the Central Department

127
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,500
investigate the case.

128
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,260
We will investigate the truth

129
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,700
and make up for it.

130
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,820
If this case

131
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,900
doesn't have a result for three or five years,

132
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,300
what should we do?

133
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,300
Then let's use the head of General Huo's wife as a threat.

134
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,860
If the case hasn't been solved,

135
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,260
we will take the punishment.

136
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,060
Or tomorrow,

137
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,740
you will report to the Ministry of Justice

138
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,460
and make a final judgment.

139
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,620
No need to do that tomorrow.

140
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,220
We will report it today.

141
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,180
A daughter of the King of Zhong Bu,

142
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,420
a son of Zhuge,

143
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,300
the Ministry of Justice will definitely pay attention to it.

144
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,260
Report it.

145
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,260
The case is settled.

146
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,740
Let's do as Mr. Zhuge said.

147
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,340
again.

148
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,540
I need to take a step back.

149
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,420
Thank you, Minesweeper.

150
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,780
When my father's case is investigated,

151
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,420
I will seriously consider it.

152
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:29,340
You are welcome to do so.

153
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,780
I just held a stand

154
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,460
within the unit.

155
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,660
You're a god of Wen.

156
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,260
And how did you get a piece of

157
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,940
Brother Zhu and Kongyun?

158
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,900
I agreed to cooperate with them.

159
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,980
What do the brothers of Shen Buying think?

160
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,780
This is my personal idea.

161
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,100
It has nothing to do with Shen Buying.

162
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,380
I just want to capture Ye Sha earlier.

163
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,580
Your temper is smelly and hard.

164
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,740
If I don't come today,

165
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,860
how will you break this game?

166
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,500
I'm reckless.

167
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,380
I'm reckless.

168
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,140
Thanks to Chief Fang.

169
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,700
It's okay.

170
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,220
We can cooperate.

171
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,780
But there's one thing.

172
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,580
You and the secret camp

173
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,660
need to tell me

174
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,140
any clues you've found out.

175
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,420
I want you to

176
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,420
catch Xiao Beiming yourself.

177
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,500
I understand.

178
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,540
Mo Chong.

179
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,660
Chief, you're here.

180
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,460
Miss Huo is really not easy.

181
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:43,740
She's too cruel.

182
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,740
Where's my senior?

183
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,460
He?

184
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,340
He should be home by now.

185
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,740
You're not following the rules.

186
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,300
I even put myself in

187
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,220
to help you.

188
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,260
Thanks.

189
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,060
It's just this time.

190
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,100
I'll do it next time.

191
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,740
If there's another chance,

192
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,380
don't say I won't help you.

193
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,740
We'll just do it

194
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,820
if we cooperate.

195
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,340
You're really petty.

196
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,740
It depends on who I'm against.

197
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,940
I'm generous enough to you.

198
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,660
What did you say?

199
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,700
Master was killed by someone.

200
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,660
How could this happen?

201
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,180
Shen Buying has done his autopsy.

202
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,220
He was killed by someone.

203
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,940
Don't worry, Madam.

204
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,620
You're not in good health.

205
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,660
It's not worth it.

206
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,740
He's your father after all.

207
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,300
Now,

208
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,260
he's gone.

209
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:00,780
Rong'er.

210
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,540
Don't hate him anymore,

211
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,500
okay?

212
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,300
Okay.

213
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,820
I can't do it.

214
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,220
I can't forget

215
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,380
where I got this injury.

216
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,140
Let's not talk about it.

217
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,380
You're tired.

218
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,660
Go back and rest.

219
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,620
I'll go back first.

220
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,500
You should rest, too.

221
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,220
Okay.

222
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,860
What's wrong, Rong'er?

223
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,420
He's gone.

224
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,940
You don't have to

225
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,820
make tea for him anymore.

226
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,580
The tea bag is useless.

227
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,020
I'll throw it away.

228
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,540
Okay.

229
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:00,660
Qingyan.

230
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,380
My Lady.

231
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,580
Let her rest

232
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,700
after I finish the porridge.

233
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:04,580
Yes.

234
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,380
Have some porridge.

235
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,740
Qingyan.

236
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,580
It's too dangerous.

237
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,620
It's good that you're back.

238
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,900
Luckily, Brother Xiao is in good health.

239
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,700
Otherwise,

240
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,780
we wouldn't have been able to shoot him.

241
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,660
Thanks to you and Mo Chong.

242
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,100
I'm back.

243
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,700
Can we wake him up?

244
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,100
Can we?

245
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,580
He'll wake up in a few days.

246
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,380
Are you okay?

247
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,180
How did I fall asleep

248
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:57,980
as soon as I opened the door?

249
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:58,620
Come on.

250
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,420
Get up.

251
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,020
You must be too tired.

252
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,660
Why did you come to me?

253
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,420
It doesn't matter.

254
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,580
Your junior sister

255
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,420
is a big girl.

256
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:08,900
Come on.

257
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,740
Put on your clothes first.

258
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,660
I have a way.

259
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:15,820
Listen to me.

260
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,140
Please come in.

261
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,420
Let me come in one by one.

262
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:22,940
That's it.

263
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,460
I'll take the back window to take a walk.

264
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,140
This time it's really dangerous.

265
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,700
I'm not worried about anyone.

266
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,380
I'm just afraid that Brother Zhu will find out something.

267
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,580
And

268
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,980
as soon as he entered the library,

269
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,380
he looked around.

270
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,980
He even looked over the next room.

271
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,420
He has always been suspicious of us.

272
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:43,860
The disease comes to the party, the water comes to the

273
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,260
family.

274
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,140
That's right.

275
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,780
The disciples of the Huo family

276
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,460
looked strange after seeing the test results.

277
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,620
It's more like they were hiding something.

278
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,460
If General Huo was really strangled to death,

279
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,980
his family and disciples

280
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,140
are very suspicious.

281
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,060
You mean

282
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,220
General Huo is very likely to be killed by someone in the Huo family.

283
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,300
That's not sure.

284
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,340
But I did find a lot of strange things

285
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,460
in the Huo family tonight.

286
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,980
That night I went to the disciples' courtyard of the Huo family.

287
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,380
It's where the disciples of the Huo family live.

288
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,820
The interior is set up in the same way as the army's cabinet.

289
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,380
The clothes and equipment

290
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,780
are also arranged in the order of the army.

291
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,460
General Huo was born in the Air Force.

292
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,900
He brought the army's strict system back home.

293
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,460
There is a training ground behind the bedroom.

294
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,060
There is a big tear gas station in the middle of the training ground.

295
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,140
There is some blood on the tear gas station.

296
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,380
That's the trace of the low blood pressure of Jingning Lei Yue.

297
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:42,980
As you can see,

298
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,540
the cut on the stage is not point-to-point.

299
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,980
It means that when Huo Zong Yao usually teaches his disciples martial arts,

300
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,660
they will fight with their lives.

301
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:54,820
And I also found a new one in the training ground.

302
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,100
So these disciples

303
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,100
were beaten by the imperial guards.

304
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,420
In the end, they were merciless and killed.

305
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,340
Except for General Huo's disciples,

306
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,020
there is something wrong with Mrs. Huo.

307
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,300
Mrs. Huo's back is injured.

308
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,420
It's obvious that she was abused.

309
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,980
And the person who killed her husband

310
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,900
should be dressed more roughly.

311
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,180
But her belly is extremely sharp.

312
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,900
It's easy to see her with her hair in the mirror.

313
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,140
It seems that her husband's death is a happy event.

314
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,500
This is obviously not right.

315
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,540
If Mrs. Huo's bruises

316
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,300
are all from Huo Zong Yao,

317
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,660
then Mrs. Huo also has a motive to kill people.

318
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,020
Not only Mrs. Huo,

319
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,780
there is also Xue Qianshan who wants to set fire.

320
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,900
Burn them with fire!

321
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,100
Push them out!

322
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,780
Xue Qianshan clearly knew that General Huo's body

323
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,620
was still on fire in the training room.

324
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,140
It means that he doesn't take the body as a corpse at all.

325
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,860
It's more like he wants to put out the fire.

326
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,420
There is another one.

327
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,500
I can't see it clearly.

328
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,700
You mean General Huo's daughter,

329
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:56,980
Huo Dai Rong?

330
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,100
That lady looks weak.

331
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,540
She doesn't look like a bad person.

332
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,460
She knew my identity at a glance.

333
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,380
She's definitely not a virtuous woman.

334
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,220
Although you're wearing a tuxedo,

335
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,860
the boots on your feet are made of blood.

336
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,500
You're a middle-class blood.

337
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,060
She's so powerful.

338
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,820
That day, she tricked me to go to the bedroom of Huo's mansion.

339
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,500
She made me bump into Mrs. Huo.

340
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,820
She exposed my identity.

341
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,380
She then tried to please me.

342
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,380
I don't know what the reason is.

343
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,660
This Miss Huo is really not simple.

344
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,020
There's not enough clues.

345
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,460
We have to go to the Huo's mansion again.

346
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,340
We have to go.

347
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,420
Junior.

348
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:47,820
Senior.

349
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:48,980
What's the matter?

350
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,820
It seems that Huo Zong Yao's case

351
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,620
has nothing to do with the night killing.

352
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,100
It seems so at present.

353
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,580
Even if General Huo is a murderer,

354
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,180
but the current criminal law,

355
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,420
Mrs. Huo or Li Zi,

356
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,940
even that Huo Dai Rong,

357
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,340
the motive for the murder is limited to the house of the housekeeper.

358
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,060
It's not related to the beach.

359
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,900
It's not related to the night killing.

360
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,500
That's why I'm worried.

361
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,540
You're worried about the white-haired president.

362
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,220
Even if we break this case,

363
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,860
it's not good for my innocence.

364
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,500
The case is complicated.

365
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,380
But your body...

366
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,340
I understand your concern.

367
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,020
Sit.

368
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,940
But you are the first to be the subordinate of Shen Bu Ying.

369
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,460
Even if General Huo's death is just a coincidence,

370
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,660
even if this case is really just a family fight,

371
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,660
it has nothing to do with the night killing.

372
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,660
But he is a life after all.

373
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,620
As the subordinate of Shen Bu Ying,

374
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,820
we shouldn't separate the gods and the gods.

375
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,540
We shouldn't be separated by the gods.

376
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,140
We shouldn't be separated by the gods.

377
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,420
The gods are different.

378
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,140
We can't let our personal feelings be more than public interest.

379
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,900
I always remember

380
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,300
the scolding from Master three years ago.

381
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,100
He said that I didn't respect life and death.

382
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,500
I don't deserve to be a man.

383
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,060
Wen Ming, you're too proud.

384
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,180
You even know that you're a father.

385
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:13,180
The night killing is scarier than all the opponents and families you've met before.

386
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,780
It's good for the people.

387
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,420
And your proud and painful heart

388
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,260
is your biggest weakness.

389
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,900
Once it's used and held back,

390
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,420
the consequences will be unimaginable.

391
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,620
When I understand it,

392
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,100
I won't have a chance to be a father again.

393
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,260
Junior sister,

394
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,340
do you remember what Master used to say

395
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,980
in the past?

396
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,300
Be polite and bow to the wind.

397
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,820
Be polite and bow to the wind.

398
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,540
Be selfless and selfless.

399
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,860
If this is hard to get,

400
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:56,060
let's say it without question.

401
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:00,180
Let's spend the night working hard

402
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,340
and don't worry about tomorrow.

403
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,020
It's a vow and a

404
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:11,020
Our hands together

405
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,100
There, there

406
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,940
There, there

407
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,940
appreciation

408
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,080
He broke the world

409
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,040
and brought caring

410
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,060
Sir, are you awake

411
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,700
You are releasing yourズ

412
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,320
I always feel

413
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,720
that I missed something

414
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,580
In my dream I just happy

415
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,080
This wanna break my chain

416
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,380
It's my fault

417
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,120
Why don't you sleep a little longer

418
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,100
See if you can keep on

419
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,220
Just watch out.

420
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,260
Wait,

421
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,860
Zhi Cai,

422
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,260
won't you be a traitor

423
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,660
by taking against your law in the medical university?

424
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,060
But I...

425
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,380
I did not do anything to you.

426
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,620
You even let wolltehh

427
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,380
take the evidence from the doctor,

428
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,100
don't you know why it wasn't darüber?

429
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,740
Is that clear?

430
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,800
How could you stop me?

431
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,700
People are cat-calm even with

432
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,540
I'm sorry.

433
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,380
You saw the body last night, right?

434
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,260
Did you find anything?

435
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,500
You mean...

436
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,940
I'm ashamed.

437
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,300
My family was killed.

438
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,380
As a disciple,

439
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,100
I didn't notice it at once.

440
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,860
Now it's time to cooperate with the investigation.

441
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,340
Please.

442
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,420
Don't bother.

443
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:39,020
I'm here to ask you a few questions.

444
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:40,980
You can ask me anything.

445
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,500
I know nothing.

446
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,300
Leave.

447
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,780
Please.

448
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,140
I'll ask you a few questions.

449
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,580
Do you know the truth about General Huo's death?

450
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:01,260
You said there was something wrong with the autopsy result last night?

451
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,540
I've thought about it.

452
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,460
I found the marks are very strange.

453
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,380
What's so strange about the marks?

454
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,100
You'll know when you see the body of the caretaker.

455
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,300
General Huo's marks on the neck

456
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,020
are covered by the powder.

457
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,780
But now the weather is hot.

458
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,260
The powder will come off in a few hours.

459
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,420
If you don't fix it in time,

460
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,300
it will be easily discovered by others.

461
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,540
General Huo has been guarding the body of General Huo

462
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,860
from the death to autopsy.

463
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,740
But no one found the marks.

464
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,340
It's not normal.

465
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,380
And there's only one possibility

466
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,660
of fixing the body on the coffin.

467
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,580
You put the powder on it yourself.

468
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,500
How's it?

469
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,500
You're right.

470
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,820
I was wrong.

471
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,620
According to the law of Qi,

472
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,700
the murderer will be punished

473
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,500
for not reporting the murder.

474
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,740
Then General Huo

475
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,340
will be in big trouble.

476
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,620
Mr. Li,

477
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,740
if you tell the truth now,

478
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,180
it's not too late for you to tell General Huo.

479
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,940
Brother Luke.

480
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,100
If you find out,

481
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:22,460
I won't need to keep it a secret.

482
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,540
You were right.

483
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,260
What was stabbed to death was

484
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,060
our own desire.

485
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,100
Not only that.

486
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,860
Even when the murderer was their friend,

487
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,900
me,

488
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,300
Brother Xue,

489
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,700
Mrs. Huo, and Miss Huo

490
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,340
were allrible when they saw it.

491
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,740
I saw it with my own eyes.

492
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,100
General Huo always said

493
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:50,660
his

494
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,140
is exactly the same as

495
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,700
killing General Huo.

496
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,420
It's General Huo himself.

497
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,580
That night,

498
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,860
I went to talk to Master with Senior Xue.

499
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,620
Get out of here!

500
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,060
You...

501
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,580
You're here to seek revenge, right?

502
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,060
I'm not afraid of you.

503
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,420
I'm not afraid of you.

504
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,500
Come on!

505
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,460
Revenge!

506
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:13,980
Master!

507
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,380
Revenge!

508
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,140
Master, why are you here?

509
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:16,740
Master!

510
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,380
Get up!

511
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,300
Revenge!

512
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:19,860
Master!

513
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,940
Revenge!

514
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:21,900
Master!

515
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:23,980
Master!

516
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,100
Master!

517
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:37,780
Come on!

518
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,780
I'll give it back to you!

519
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,580
That moment

520
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,460
happened in front of us.

521
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,100
You killed yourself.

522
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,580
I'm telling the truth.

523
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,780
I'm telling the truth.

524
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,620
I was there that night.

525
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,300
I, Senior Xue,

526
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,660
Lady Huo,

527
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,580
and two maids

528
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,660
saw it.

529
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:14,940
Qi Yi Zhuang

530
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,740
knew it at once.

531
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,060
But I don't understand

532
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,740
how he killed himself.

533
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,420
When a person is awake,

534
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,380
it's hard to kill yourself.

535
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,420
It's impossible when he's awake.

536
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,940
But if he's not awake...

537
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,820
What do you mean?

538
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,020
Do you know Wushisan?

539
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:35,660
I know.

540
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,820
It's a medicine for the air.

541
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,500
Wushisan is used to treat colds.

542
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,140
But an official in the previous dynasty found that

543
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,980
it would cause body heat

544
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,220
and the body would be cold.

545
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,340
It would cause hallucination.

546
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,020
It has a feeling of floating.

547
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,380
It's widely spread under his guidance.

548
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,700
But later, someone found that

549
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,620
this medicine would cause chronic poisoning.

550
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,620
Many long-term users died.

551
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,940
So it was listed as a medicine for the air.

552
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,500
Illusion?

553
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,020
You mean

554
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,940
General Huo died in hallucination?

555
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,380
It's possible.

556
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,300
General Huo is a good fighter.

557
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,380
If he's too strong,

558
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,740
even if he's a bit more intelligent,

559
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,180
he can't turn the tables.

560
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,900
From the surface,

561
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,180
I can't verify your guess.

562
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,860
I need to verify it.

563
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:16,940
It's okay.

564
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,860
Zhuge Kongyun should be asking around in Huo's Mansion.

565
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,020
We still have time.

566
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,020
Senior.

567
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,460
The police are investigating the case.

568
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,940
Who are they investigating?

569
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,140
General Huo.

570
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,740
It's General Huo again.

571
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:28,860
Senior,

572
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:29,860
Feng Guzuo just came here.

573
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,700
He hasn't left yet.

574
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,860
Why is he here again?

575
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,060
I don't know.

576
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,620
I'm here.

577
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,780
I'm here.

578
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,940
I'm here.

579
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,060
I'm here.

580
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,180
I'm here.

581
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,300
I'm here.

582
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,420
I'm here.

583
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,540
I'm here.

584
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,660
I'm here.

585
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,780
I'm here.

586
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,900
I'm here.

587
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,020
I'm here.

588
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,140
I'm here.

589
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,260
I'm here.

590
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,380
I'm here.

591
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,500
I'm here.

592
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,620
I'm here.

593
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,740
I'm here.

594
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,860
I'm here.

595
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,980
I'm here.

596
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,100
I'm here.

597
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,220
I'm here.

598
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,340
I'm here.

599
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,460
I'm here.

600
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,580
I'm here.

601
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,700
I'm here.

602
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,820
I'm here.

603
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,940
I'm here.

604
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,060
I'm here.

605
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,180
I'm here.

606
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,300
I'm here.

607
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,420
I'm here.

608
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,540
I'm here.

609
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,660
I'm here.

610
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,780
I'm here.

611
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,900
I'm here.

612
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,020
I'm here.

613
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,020
Why are you here?

614
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,820
What do you mean?

615
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,500
I should be asking you.

616
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:37,860
Why are you here?

617
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:38,980
Me?

618
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,100
Last night,

619
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,420
I found that this corpse

620
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,940
might have some strange parts.

621
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,060
So I came here

622
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,580
to re-examine it.

623
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,580
What strange parts?

624
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,700
General Huo

625
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,820
might have strangled himself to death.

626
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,340
Tang.

627
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,740
What?

628
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,860
You can't run away now.

629
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:01,980
You scared me.

630
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,100
What's wrong?

631
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,020
If General Huo really strangled himself to death,

632
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,340
Mrs. Huo must know.

633
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,540
Otherwise, she wouldn't have hidden

634
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,660
the scars on her neck.

635
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,140
The Confucian Confucianism of the State of Chu is so sharp

636
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,260
that they can't hide it.

637
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,780
But she is very sharp.

638
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,780
They can't hide it.

639
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,260
She will definitely come here

640
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,380
to verify it.

641
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,260
Confucian Confucianism of the State of Chu?

642
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,500
She's so sharp.

643
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,780
She should be on her way here now.

644
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,220
What should we do?

645
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,580
Do as I said.

646
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,740
The drug for superstition?

647
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,860
Yes.

648
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,380
But I need to dig up the corpse

649
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,780
to verify this guess.

650
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,060
Then dig it up.

651
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,580
What do you mean?

652
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,980
The process of digging up the corpse

653
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,180
might be difficult to see.

654
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,540
Why don't you two avoid it?

655
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,940
It's all about the

656
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,060
concubine and the body.

657
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,660
You can't stand it?

658
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,780
Yes.

659
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,900
Mr. Zhuge must be bold and brave.

660
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,660
But when I was digging up the corpse last time,

661
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,060
the loyal concubine suffered for several days.

662
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,260
The loyal concubine is afraid of this?

663
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,780
I'm a woman after all.

664
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,780
What's wrong with me not seeing the body?

665
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,380
I almost forgot that you are a woman.

666
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,460
Since you can't see it,

667
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,380
don't look at it.

668
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,380
Cut the crap.

669
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,380
Since you didn't lie,

670
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,380
I'll go back to the House of Huo to continue interrogating.

671
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,980
I'll tell you the result when I come out.

672
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,100
Come on.

673
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,380
Come on.

674
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,380
Brother, is it really safe?

675
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,380
Zhuge was held back by Feng Yingzhuo.

676
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,500
I still have time.

677
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,580
How about I go with you?

678
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,700
If this happens,

679
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,380
we can escape from the capital together.

680
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,980
You are thoughtful.

681
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:25,900
Of course.

682
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,180
I'm now old enough to have white hair on my arm.

683
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,300
I can take you there.

684
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,420
Let me ask you.

685
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,300
I've used your identity now.

686
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,420
Whose identity do you use?

687
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,500
Jiang Yi.

688
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,620
No, Jiang Yi is a bit old.

689
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,500
I'm a little bit old when I go to Feng Ying.

690
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,620
I'm not a woman.

691
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,740
I'm a woman.

692
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,740
I'm a little old.

693
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,460
I'm a little ugly when I go to Feng Ying.

694
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,420
You can go home before you think it through.

695
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,500
Can I have my ID card?

696
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,100
I think it's okay.

697
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,500
Mr. Zhuge.

698
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,020
You'd better go outside and take a breath.

699
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,540
Leave it to me.

700
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,900
No.

701
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,900
Mr. Zhuge is so diligent.

702
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,220
It's really touching.

703
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,740
How about this?

704
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,660
I have a bottle of medicine in my box.

705
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,660
You can relieve it.

706
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,260
Well...

707
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,100
This...

708
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,220
No, it's the long-term medicine.

709
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,220
This?

710
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,540
Yes, that's the bottle.

711
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,140
What's this?

712
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:38,800
This is called the

713
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,960
This is the only pill I've made.

714
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,080
I don't want to take it out.

715
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,880
Recently, I've made a new pill

716
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,480
that can make you feel better.

717
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,880
Sir.

718
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,680
Is this the same as the blood-sucking pill?

719
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,360
It was an accident last time. It was a misunderstanding.

720
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,720
Now we're on the same boat.

721
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,120
How can I lie to you?

722
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,800
How is it?

723
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,720
I didn't lie to you, did I?

724
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,320
Wait a moment.

725
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,840
Li Xiao said General Huo was honored.

726
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,720
But he died so strangely.

727
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,440
The people of Huo's Mansion were not happy with his death.

728
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,160
They were criticized and disrespected.

729
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,960
So they covered the traces with powder.

730
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,880
They said he died of illness.

731
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,920
If Feng Xi died,

732
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,040
the people of Huo's Mansion would be very upset.

733
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,840
He died of illness.

734
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,880
If Feng Xin Zhuo can diagnose

735
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,640
the mysterious drug in General Huo's body,

736
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,640
the Huo's Mansion will be involved.

737
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,560
Who is it?

738
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,160
It's a bad sword. It can kill.

739
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,480
What if Zhuge Kong Yun comes back?

740
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,640
Feng Xin Zhuo is here.

741
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,120
He can wait a while.

742
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,200
Mrs. Zhou, who is this?

743
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,120
This is Tong Shuang, the constable of the Divine Buying Company.

744
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,240
Time is tight recently.

745
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,320
Please let me and Mr. Zhuge have a check-up.

746
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,160
Greetings, Constable Tong.

747
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,800
Constable Zhong,

748
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,280
the autopsy result is not as I said.

749
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,800
The family member is dying.

750
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,280
Mr. Zhuge is still in the autopsy.

751
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,400
There are still many doubts on the body that have not been found.

752
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,600
But before that,

753
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,480
I want to see the person who died on the night of General Huo's death.

754
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,480
What?

755
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,600
Is it inconvenient?

756
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,960
Nothing.

757
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,280
Come with me.

758
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,960
Senior Brother Xue is not in the mansion today.

759
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,040
He went out early in the morning.

760
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,560
Please tell Senior Brother Xue

761
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,480
that the people of the Divine Buying Company came to visit.

762
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,760
Please.

763
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,160
Master,

764
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,480
the Divine Buying Company is asking for you.

765
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,680
Master.

766
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,680
Master died suddenly.

767
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,280
Madam is too sad.

768
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,640
She is not feeling well today.

769
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,760
It's not convenient for her to see guests.

770
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,880
Please go back.

771
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,960
How about you two come again some other day?

772
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:38,880
Mr. Li,

773
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,080
can you take us to the residence?

774
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:45,880
Please.

775
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,200
This is my residence.

776
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,840
You can check it out.

777
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,400
When did you enter General Huo's house?

778
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,200
Have you ever fought with General Huo?

779
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,800
I'm ashamed.

780
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,920
I was defeated in Fuzhou three years ago.

781
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,840
I was defeated ten times.

782
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,160
I have never been to the battlefield.

783
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,520
I'm inferior to Senior Brother Xue.

784
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,360
He was born in the army.

785
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,880
He fought with Master.

786
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,800
I admire Master's ability.

787
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,560
He used his knowledge

788
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,960
to help Master manage his family business.

789
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,360
Manage family business?

790
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,920
Mr. Li, you don't like me?

791
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,280
I know some martial arts.

792
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,000
But I'm inferior to other brothers.

793
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,400
I heard that General Huo was very interested in martial arts.

794
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,360
I didn't expect to admire Mr. Li.

795
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,080
Mr. Li, you are very good at martial arts.

796
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,120
I'm flattered.

797
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,040
No.

798
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,520
What's wrong, Mr. Li?

799
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,240
This knife is sharp.

800
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,640
You can't hurt yourself.

801
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,520
It's okay.

802
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,520
This knife is exquisite and unique.

803
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,440
It's really beautiful.

804
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,840
But Mr. Li,

805
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,440
you are not good at it.

806
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,800
You are not good at it.

807
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,040
You are not good at it.

808
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,520
But Mr. Li,

809
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,280
why do you hang the knife on the bedside?

810
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,160
It's not sharp enough to cut the top of the head.

811
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,960
This knife is given by my family.

812
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,320
I hang it on the bedside

813
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,240
to miss my family day and night.

814
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,560
I see.

815
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,520
Sorry, I'm sorry.

816
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,240
I'm sorry

817
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,440
for disturbing you.

818
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,000
I heard that General Huo's subordinate

819
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,280
is very strict.

820
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,760
He even abused his subordinate.

821
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,920
Is that true?

822
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,280
My family was born

823
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,160
in the military.

824
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,480
It's common for a martial artist to be fierce.

825
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,680
Besides, I'm a general.

826
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,880
I'm not good at military.

827
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,280
But it's a abuse.

828
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,960
It's a fact.

829
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,160
General Huo, do you have any special things

830
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,680
that you do on a daily basis?

831
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,680
I did a lot of things on a daily basis.

832
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,160
I do things in a good way.

833
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,240
I eat three meals a day and eat with my disciples.

834
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,840
I have nothing special.

835
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,320
Is Miss Huo in the mansion?

836
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,840
Can you take us to see her?

837
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,400
Okay, I'll take you there.

838
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,520
Thank you.

839
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,080
What did you find?

840
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,320
General Huo's internal organs

841
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,760
are as white as a grass.

842
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,920
This is a feature of a drug

843
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,960
that has been used for a long time.

844
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,560
Used for a long time?

845
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,600
Shut up.

846
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,280
Although I can't see what kind of drug it is,

847
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,160
I'm worried that

848
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,280
it's a drug that

849
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,360
has been used for months

850
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,200
or even half a year.

851
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,360
This is the case

852
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:40,240
in the

853
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,200
house.

854
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,680
But General Huo didn't find the poison

855
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,240
after being used for so long?

856
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,360
Either he killed the murderer

857
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,120
and the murderer poisoned him every day.

858
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,160
But the amount is small.

859
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,760
General Huo naturally didn't notice it.

860
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,240
In the end, the minority

861
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,680
led to General Huo being suspicious in the confusion.

862
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,720
Or it's like the previous dynasty.

863
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,320
General Huo had a drug

864
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,800
that couldn't be controlled every day.

865
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,920
He died in the end.

866
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,280
No matter what the theory is,

867
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,960
we have to go to the mansion to check it.

868
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,720
Come with me.

869
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,560
Me?

870
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,360
I don't know any secret medicine.

871
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,240
That's where Feng Yi Niang lives in the front.

872
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,800
Steward Li.

873
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,640
Lord Shu Ge is here.

874
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,680
Lord Shu Ge is here.

875
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,440
I'm here to check the house.

876
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,440
Are you going to see Lord Shu Ge

877
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,120
or to ask about the Eastern Courtyard?

878
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:33,840
Mr. Li,

879
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,280
go and see Lord Shu Ge first.

880
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,400
We'll see.

881
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,880
I'm sorry.

882
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,200
I'll leave you to it.

883
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,200
They're going to the house.

884
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,120
It seems that there is indeed a secret medicine in the body.

885
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,080
The order has arrived.

886
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,680
If we continue to investigate,

887
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,120
what will you do in a while?

888
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,240
I'll go to the Eastern Courtyard.

889
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,240
I'll go to the Eastern Courtyard.

890
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,880
How can you go out for a while?

891
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,320
He must have brought Feng Xin Zhu

892
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,040
to help us delay for a while.

893
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,840
The Eastern Courtyard is the residence of Miss Huo and Feng Yi Niang.

894
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,840
Miss Huo's words

895
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,440
are even different from mine.

896
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,040
They're here.

897
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,560
We have to go and see.

898
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,200
But...

899
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,120
Don't worry.

900
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,800
It won't take too long.

901
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,720
Mr. Li has informed the bodyguard

902
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,960
that Zhong Bu Kuan is coming.

903
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,520
Yi Niang is not well.

904
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,880
She's resting inside.

905
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,360
I'll wait here.

906
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,720
Qi Ying, you can leave first.

907
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,440
I'll do it.

908
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,240
Yes.

909
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,600
If you have any questions,

910
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,480
just ask.

911
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,000
I'll do my best to answer them.

912
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,000
I'll do my best to answer them.

913
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,360
Thank you, Miss Huo.

914
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,320
This is...

915
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,280
I'm Tong Shuang, the bodyguard.

916
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,280
Please have some tea.

917
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,320
Why do you keep staring at him?

918
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,680
It's fate.

919
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,480
Tong Bu Kuan's appearance

920
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,680
is like a friend of my daughter.

921
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,680
What a coincidence.

922
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,680
I wonder where Miss Huo's

923
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,560
friend is now.

924
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,880
She went out for a long time

925
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,200
and hasn't returned yet.

926
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,480
I'm sorry.

927
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,600
I'm sorry.

928
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,720
I'm sorry.

929
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,840
I'm sorry.

930
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,960
I'm sorry.

931
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,680
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

932
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,080
I heard from Mr. Li

933
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,680
that General Huo died that night.

934
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,160
You were there, Miss Huo.

935
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,120
And the scars on General Huo's body

936
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,040
were covered by the powder of the powder.

937
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,520
Is that true?

938
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,200
Yes.

939
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,320
Since you know the cause of General's death,

940
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,640
why did you lie to me that night?

941
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,400
Since you two have found out

942
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,200
that my father killed himself,

943
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,080
why did you come to question me again?

944
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,120
Is there any doubt about the case?

945
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,640
Of course there is.

946
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,560
My father is usually calm and calm.

947
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,480
He doesn't have any worries.

948
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,680
Why do you suddenly want to ask for advice?

949
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,120
Although I saw it with my own eyes,

950
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,120
it may not be the truth.

951
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,120
So I have doubts about my father's death.

952
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,280
What I said to Zhong Bu Kuan that day

953
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,960
is all true and true.

954
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,360
Why didn't you say it directly when you were testing the body?

955
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,640
You two are wise.

956
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,160
Although I am the daughter of Huo's family,

957
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,680
I know that Huo's family is really a small family.

958
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,080
I didn't want to save myself that day.

959
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:41,320
Fortunately, I didn't tell you the truth.

960
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,240
Only the death of my father can be proved.

961
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,160
I am here to ask you

962
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,400
to thank you two.

963
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,120
I am here to thank you.

964
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,880
I am here to thank you.

965
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,760
I am here to thank you.

966
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,760
I am here to thank you.

00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,760
I am here to thank you.

968
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,680

969
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,680
I am here to thank you.

970
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,600
I am here to thank you.

971
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,680
I am here to thank you.

972
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,720
I am here to thank you.

973
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,600
I am here to thank you.

974
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,640
I am here to thank you.

975
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,640
I am here to thank you.

976
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,720
I am here to thank you.

977
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,840
I am here to thank you.

978
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,040
I am here to thank you.

979
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,200
I am here to thank you.

980
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,120
Whose sword is sharp?

981
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,460
Who is stabbing someone in the back?

982
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,680
Someone that will run away, someone that will get a beating,

983
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,480
Is notенить by the sword秀 for retribution

984
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,960
Let people say you are running red

985
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,440
esin and 1500 thousand people

986
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:07,480
have a fear of death

987
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:09,920
Meeting the dark

988
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,200
There is no need to be afraid to be sharp

989
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,840
The point you have not reached

990
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,000
is already out

991
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
