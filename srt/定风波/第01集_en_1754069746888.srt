1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
pupil

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,040
first

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,000
this

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,160
I

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:21,180
One who controls the performed

6
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,860
48 loyal ministers who were bold and brave

7
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,100
ordered to build a high-ranking court

8
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,860
named Langhua Pavilion.

9
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,060
The court was ranked according to the size of the palace.

10
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,740
Among them, the highest ranking

11
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:40,100
was Lu Wenzhong, Qin Ye, Fan Jingzhi,

12
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,140
and Shen Bi, four ministers of the government.

13
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:44,940
However,

14
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,980
on the opening day of Langhua Pavilion,

15
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,140
the Emperor led his ministers to visit the court.

16
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,900
A very strange thing

17
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,100
happened in front of everyone.

18
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,100
Four loyal ministers cried in sorrow.

19
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,620
This is an ominous move.

20
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,180
The Emperor ordered all the people to shut up.

21
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,620
But who knew that in the next few days,

22
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,780
the four ministers would be in trouble.

23
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,500
The bandits will not survive.

24
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,180
We must be quick this time.

25
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,460
Don't worry, my lord.

26
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,140
We'll be there in three days.

27
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:40,940
My lord!

28
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,540
My lord!

29
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,580
My lord!

30
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,140
My lord, it's hard to stay here.

31
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,740
You'd better go to bed early.

32
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:02,940
If you don't want to be in a hurry,

33
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,860
go open the window and take a breath.

34
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:05,860
Yes.

35
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,580
My lord!

36
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:15,900
My lord!

37
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,340
My lord!

38
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,060
Help!

39
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,180
Help!

40
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:26,700
Hurry!

41
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,460
The Lord is looking for us!

42
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,220
Don't worry!

43
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,140
Call the Lord!

44
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,540
No!

45
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,820
The cheeks of three loyal ministers

46
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:17,200
are

47
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
Are above!

48
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,960
Embrace the romantic regulation,

49
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,140
and also take your place a few times!

50
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,980
Wei Bao iy will get rich in love!

51
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,900
Look!

52
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,220
Red...

53
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:30,680
Red...

54
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,720
The comparison studied again!

55
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,480
What the heck?

56
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,700
It's really red!

57
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:31,500
Ni Cur You

58
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,760
it's good

59
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:33,820
take it

60
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,480
come on, slow down

61
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,160
Pereara

62
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,600
everything is fixed

63
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,800
Junior Jiefang, how about it

64
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,800
any clues ?

65
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:44,960
this

66
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,480
what is this

67
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,960
Centers for Extreme Measures of She slippery hills.

68
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,400
Okay for ma'am.

69
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,960
You are Lin Shu's cousin, Lin Kang.

70
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,960
You said Lin Shu was sick and had a miscarriage.

71
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,960
Her temperament changed and she was violent.

72
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,960
She was so desperate and unwilling to live.

73
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,960
So she begged you to help her to end it.

74
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,960
You did it because you protected her with respect to her brother.

75
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,960
Yes, sir.

76
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,960
You lied. If you really couldn't bear it,

77
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,960
you must be very confused.

78
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,960
It's also very chaotic to stab her.

79
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,960
But after five tests,

80
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,960
you found that the wound on the victim was concentrated on the left chest

81
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,960
and fell on the ground.

82
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,960
It shows how calm and calm you were when you stabbed her.

83
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,960
And the reason you chose to do it in the rain of thunder

84
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,960
is to use the thunder to cover the movement of killing yourself.

85
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,960
Sir, I have a deep relationship with Ashu.

86
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,960
After Ashu's miscarriage, I took care of her myself.

87
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,960
I was so careful.

88
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,960
I treated her like this.

89
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,960
How could I have killed her?

90
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,960
You were so careful.

91
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,960
But I only found the remains of the gang in the bed.

92
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,960
You ate the fat head and the big ears,

93
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,960
but you didn't even feed the beggar.

94
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,960
Ziwei, five tests found that

95
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,960
her back and butt were full of holes.

96
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,960
This is what you call careful care.

97
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,960
You said that Lin Shu's temperament changed,

98
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,960
but even if she was greedy in the lower body,

99
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,960
she had to stretch out her arms and use her own mouth to feed the sparrow on the window.

100
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,960
She was so kind.

101
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,960
You said she was violent.

102
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,960
No, this is all your speculation.

103
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,960
After Lin Shu's miscarriage,

104
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,960
you moved into Lin's house and lived with your master.

105
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,960
You dispersed her servants and tortured her.

106
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,960
Seeing her life was so tough,

107
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,960
you started to kill her.

108
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,960
After Lin Shu died,

109
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,960
you couldn't even wait for the first wife,

110
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,960
so you rushed to the government to change the house.

111
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,960
The diary on the house was written clearly.

112
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
How dare you deny it?

113
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,960
Lin Kang, you were so heartbroken that you killed Lin Shu.

114
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,960
You didn't want to end her pain.

115
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,960
You just wanted to take her property.

116
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,960
Have you finished eating?

117
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,960
Hurry up.

118
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,960
She's covered in blood.

119
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,960
Let's go.

120
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
Let's go.

121
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,960
Shen Buying?

122
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,960
You're here so fast.

123
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,960
I'm here to see you.

124
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,960
Shen Buying?

125
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,960
You're here so fast.

126
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,960
Junior.

127
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,960
Senior.

128
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,960
Second, two more bowls of noodles.

129
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,960
Okay, Uncle Xiao.

130
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,960
Uncle Xiao?

131
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,960
Uncle Xiao?

132
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,960
I'm Xiao Bei Ming.

133
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,960
Uncle Xiao.

134
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
Uncle Xiao.

135
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,960
Lin Kang's family went to settle the case.

136
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,960
But Zhang Zhuang's case is being followed closely.

137
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,960
How long have you been in the prison?

138
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,960
One day and one night.

139
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,960
Their families are anxious.

140
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,960
They want to talk to us.

141
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,960
It's almost time.

142
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,960
Tell me.

143
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,960
I'll go change my body.

144
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,960
Go catch them.

145
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,960
Zhang Zhuang indeed died of suffocation.

146
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,960
But it's not lung disease.

147
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,960
It's a poison.

148
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,960
I found a rat's urine at the corner of his body.

149
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
Rat?

150
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,960
Not an ordinary rat.

151
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,960
It's a rare poison.

152
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,960
It's called the closed-eyed rat.

153
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,960
It's a poison that can make people suffocate.

154
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,960
It died of suffocation.

155
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,960
It looks like it's not good for lung disease.

156
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,960
And this poison can't be tested by ordinary methods.

157
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,960
It has to wait for a day and a night.

158
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,960
Senior.

159
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,960
You go back and press the steamed bun on the wound.

160
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,960
If the steamed bun turns black, you can catch people.

161
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,960
Catch who?

162
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,960
The closed-eyed rat loves to eat purple snake's urine.

163
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,960
The whole family only has its wife's nail in purple.

164
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,960
That rat should be in the soil in its room.

165
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,960
You guys be careful.

166
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,960
Don't get bitten.

167
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,960
I'm going.

168
00:10:53,960 --> 00:11:04,000
The flower

169
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,960
is dead.

170
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,960
Why?

171
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,960
Because there is no such person.

172
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,960
The wound on the flower's neck.

173
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,960
The skin is not turned over.

174
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,960
But the skin on the top of the head is turned over.

175
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,960
It means he died of a head impact.

176
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,960
He was disguised as a throat.

177
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
There is a knife at the crime scene.

178
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,960
But there is no blood on the impact.

179
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,960
If you say so, he's not dead.

180
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,960
Who is the murderer?

181
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,960
Since this crime scene is fake.

182
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,960
Then the one who saw the robber enter the room to kill people.

183
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,960
The one who saw the robber face to face.

184
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,960
It's also fake.

185
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,960
You're the second.

186
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,960
You put this on.

187
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,960
He will think we believe what he said after he sees it.

188
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,960
So he relaxed his vigilance to pick up the dirty things he stole and hid.

189
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,960
I'm going to order a man to collect the dirty goods.

190
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,960
Senior brother.

191
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,960
Awesome.

192
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,960
Second.

193
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,960
Pay the bill.

194
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,960
Uncle Xiao.

195
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,960
Uncle Xiao.

196
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,960
You only have ten of these.

197
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,960
Keep it.

198
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,960
This money is for you.

199
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,960
For me?

200
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,960
Your eyes are full of blood.

201
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,960
Obviously lack of rest.

202
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,080
Your sleeve and chest are full of

203
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,080
medicine.

204
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,080
It should be medicine.

205
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,080
Your mother usually helps you pick vegetables here.

206
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,080
I haven't seen her since these days.

207
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,080
If I guess right.

208
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,080
She should be sick.

209
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,080
Uncle Xiao.

210
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,080
You guessed right.

211
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,080
My mother is seriously ill these days.

212
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,080
I just want to sell a few more bowls of noodles.

213
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,080
Save money to catch her medicine.

214
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,080
But I can't take your money.

215
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,080
Keep it.

216
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,080
It's important to save lives.

217
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,080
Don't delay the illness.

218
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,080
Thank you, Uncle Xiao.

219
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,080
Senior brother.

220
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,080
Someone from the palace said

221
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,080
you and master will pass by soon.

222
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,080
This is the donation.

223
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,080
Uncle Xiao.

224
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,080
Look at your blood.

225
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,080
Who do you think escaped from prison?

226
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,080
Brother Zhuge.

227
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,080
So many cases of death in the capital.

228
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,080
His Majesty has sent a staff of our department.

229
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,080
I'm so tired.

230
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,080
I want to be like you.

231
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,080
I hide behind the tavern every day.

232
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,080
Eat, drink, play and have fun.

233
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,080
I'm so tired.

234
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,080
I'm so tired.

235
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,080
I want to be like you.

236
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
You are so surprised.

237
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,200
The emperor hasn't decided who will be responsible for this case.

238
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,200
Otherwise, you wouldn't see me here.

239
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
Of course.

240
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
But this time,

241
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,200
you are afraid that you will waste your time like before.

242
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,200
You don't think you will always be in the top position, do you?

243
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,200
It's not a big deal.

244
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
Uncle.

245
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,200
Your Majesty.

246
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,200
The thief Ye Sha killed our officials in Qi.

247
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,200
It caused the people's resentment to be so fierce.

248
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
His heart was killed.

249
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,200
Our An Zhenying is willing to capture Ye Sha

250
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,200
and share your worries.

251
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,200
Your Majesty.

252
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,200
Shen Buyin is in charge of the capital's affairs.

253
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,200
This case should be handled by Shen Buyin.

254
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,200
The court's case is always taken care of by An Zhenying.

255
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,200
This case should be handed over to An Zhenying.

256
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,320
Alright.

257
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,320
Don't argue.

258
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,320
The most important thing is to solve this case quickly.

259
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,320
I have a suggestion.

260
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,320
How about you and Shen Buyin

261
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,320
work together to solve this case?

262
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,320
Your Majesty.

263
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,320
I don't think it's appropriate.

264
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,320
It's easy to stir up a stir in a joint case.

265
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,320
I'm willing to take this case alone.

266
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,320
It only takes a month to solve this case.

267
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,320
Ye Sha's murder.

268
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,320
I don't know how many officials I have left after a month.

269
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,320
Yes.

270
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,440
Your Majesty.

271
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,440
I only need ten.

272
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,440
OK.

273
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,440
Then...

274
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,440
Three days.

275
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,440
Your Majesty.

276
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,440
I only need three days to solve this case.

277
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,440
Xiao Bei Ming.

278
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,440
This is the court.

279
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,440
How dare you lie to the king?

280
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,440
Xiao Bei Ming.

281
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,440
I heard that you've been solving the chess case recently.

282
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,440
You're a talent that our country can't have.

283
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,440
But is it too easy to solve this case

284
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,560
if you don't have a good mind?

285
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,560
I'm not a good mind.

286
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,560
But I have a wedding in three days.

287
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,560
I can't delay it too long.

288
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,560
So I found out that this case only needs three days.

289
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,560
Bei Ming.

290
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,560
OK.

291
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,560
Three days.

292
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,560
If this case doesn't make any progress in three days,

293
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,560
I won't let you go.

294
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,560
Yes, Your Majesty.

295
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,680
Sit down and have some tea.

296
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,680
Thank you, Your Majesty.

297
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,680
Your Majesty is a little arrogant.

298
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,680
This case is not as simple as it looks.

299
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,680
Three days is too short.

300
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,680
I dare to speculate.

301
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,680
I'm afraid this case is different from the old one.

302
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,680
Let go.

303
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,680
I'm afraid this case is different from the old one.

304
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,680
Let go.

305
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,800
How dare you!

306
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,800
Your Majesty, please don't be angry.

307
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,800
Zhong Yun Chi.

308
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,800
Don't forget why I left you.

309
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,800
Why?

310
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,800
I dare not.

311
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,800
I know I'm guilty.

312
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,800
I want to hear the truth about that year

313
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,800
for another half a word.

314
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,800
Yes.

315
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,800
I, Shen Buying, will do my best

316
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,920
to catch the thief Ye Sha as soon as possible.

317
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,920
I won't let the case of that year go to the public.

318
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,920
My country is in a difficult time.

319
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,920
I can't let these thieves

320
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,920
get close to the rich and destroy my peace.

321
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,920
Please rest assured, Your Majesty.

322
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,920
I swear by my life

323
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,920
I won't break this case.

324
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,920
I'll die to atone for my crime.

325
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,920
If you catch him, you will be killed.

326
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

327
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,040
Please come in.

328
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,040
Three-star Zhao, four-star talent.

329
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,040
Please.

330
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,040
Please sit down.

331
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,040
Please continue.

332
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,040
Three-star Zhao, four-star talent.

333
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,040
Please sit down.

334
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,040
Xiao Weiming is making a fool of himself.

335
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,040
He's been acting like this for three days.

336
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,160
I'd like to see how they play with me.

337
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,160
I know Xiao Weiming very well.

338
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,160
He is arrogant and arrogant.

339
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,160
He won't do anything stupid.

340
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,160
He's so mature.

341
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,160
I'm afraid he's got a partner.

342
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,160
Yun, keep an eye on Shen Buying.

343
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,160
If anything happens, let me know.

344
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

345
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,160
Master, I...

346
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,160
Do you know that

347
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,160
now the people are saying that

348
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,160
Ye Sha is a ghost.

349
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,160
If the officials who left their names

350
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,160
in Langhua Pavilion are all afraid of him,

351
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,160
Ye Sha is so high-profile

352
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,160
and good at making a fool of the public.

353
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,160
He's not an ordinary person.

354
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,160
How dare you say that in front of His Majesty

355
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,160
and take three days off?

356
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,160
If you can't find the clues

357
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,160
for three days,

358
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,160
you're guilty of deceiving the emperor.

359
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,160
Master, don't be stupid.

360
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,160
I dare to take three days off

361
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,160
because I'm worried about my son.

362
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,280
I'm worried that

363
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,280
your son has already had a plan.

364
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,280
What plan?

365
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,280
Has anyone entered the tomb after the sad tears?

366
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,280
On the day of the incident,

367
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,280
His Majesty ordered to clear the blood in the tomb.

368
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,280
No one came in except me.

369
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,280
Thank you.

370
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,280
The Emperor's Residence

371
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,280
When did you recognize me?

372
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,280
I recognized you at the first sight.

373
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,280
Then you still fight with me.

374
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,280
I saw you were in a good mood just now.

375
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,280
I want to practice with you.

376
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,280
So you lost to me on purpose just now.

377
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,280
When we usually get along,

378
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,280
which time did I beat you?

379
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,280
Aren't you afraid that you'll fall down and die?

380
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,280
I know you'll hold me.

381
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,280
Yes, yes, yes.

382
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,280
You know everything.

383
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,280
There's nothing you don't know.

384
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,280
Junior,

385
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,280
are you hiding the master from investigating?

386
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,280
Why do I have to let you investigate?

387
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,280
I'm not allowed to.

388
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,280
I'm investigating by order.

389
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,280
I'm also Shen Buying's subordinate.

390
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,280
Then...

391
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,280
Are you going to fight here

392
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,400
or go back to be the master?

393
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,400
I don't want you to investigate.

394
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,400
I'm worried about your safety.

395
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,400
I'll send you back.

396
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,400
Don't take my father as a burden.

397
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,400
You promised me.

398
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,400
You allowed me to investigate with you after the wedding.

399
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,400
What? You want to take me as a burden?

400
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,400
I...

401
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,400
Junior.

402
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,400
Stop it. Come down.

403
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,400
Come on, go home.

404
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,400
Even you think I'm fooling around.

405
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,400
I...

406
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,400
You know how many years I've suffered

407
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,520
to be a subordinate.

408
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,520
I finally passed the test.

409
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,520
I thought I could take the lead to solve the case and save people.

410
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,520
Just because I'm a girl.

411
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,520
You all coax me not to let me investigate.

412
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,520
Someone said my father was the subordinate in private.

413
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,520
That's why I became a subordinate.

414
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,520
Junior,

415
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,520
the seniors don't let you investigate.

416
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,520
They're worried about your safety.

417
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,520
As for those rumors...

418
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,520
Rumors?

419
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,520
I can ignore the rumors.

420
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,520
But I have to do something.

421
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,520
If you think I'm fooling around

422
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,520
and don't let me investigate,

423
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,520
I...

424
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,640
I'll figure it out myself.

425
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,640
I want to let the world know

426
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,640
that even a girl can be an excellent subordinate.

427
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,640
You can definitely be the best subordinate.

428
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,640
I never doubt that.

429
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,640
But this case is too special.

430
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,640
It's too dangerous to let it out.

431
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,640
You saw it too.

432
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,640
No.

433
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,640
Junior.

434
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,760
I'm sorry.

435
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,760
Okay, okay, okay.

436
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,760
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

437
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,760
I'll help you investigate.

438
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,760
I'll help you clean up.

439
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,760
Which one won't cry when solving the case?

440
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,760
You're in trouble.

441
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,760
You promised me.

442
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,760
It's a promise.

443
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,760
Don't break it.

444
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,760
Zhong Xue Man.

445
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,760
You...

446
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,760
Where's Xue Lei?

447
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,760
He was swept away.

448
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,880
How can you investigate after being swept away?

449
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,880
There must be a motive for the case.

450
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,880
There must be something wrong with this case.

451
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,880
Do you believe in the ghost god?

452
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,880
My father said

453
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,880
that the ghost god can't be trusted.

454
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,880
The world is full of ghosts.

455
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,880
It's up to people.

456
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,880
That's right.

457
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,880
There must be a motive for the case.

458
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,880
Do you know what the meaning of the night kill is?

459
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,880
There's a legend in the folk.

460
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,880
If there is a grudge after a person dies,

461
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,880
it's hard to break the soul and it's hard to break the cycle.

462
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,880
It turns into a ghost.

463
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
The ghost god is called Night Kill.

464
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
It's said that Night Kill's life is killing and impure.

465
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Brother.

466
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Although your ability in solving the case is better than mine,

467
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
the folk's fiction is much more than mine.

468
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Moreover,

469
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
after Night Kill killed a few adults,

470
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
he didn't take the money.

471
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
So he didn't kill them for money,

472
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
but revenge.

473
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Am I right?

474
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Not at all.

475
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I think all Night Kill has done

476
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
is to spread rumors.

477
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
If you don't believe me,

478
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
please be my friend.

479
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
If you don't believe me,

480
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
please be my friend.

481
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
If you don't believe me,

482
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,120
you can't do anything about it.

483
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,120
If it's just for revenge,

484
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,120
there's no need to do anything about it.

485
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,120
He wants everyone to believe that

486
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,120
Night Kill is coming.

487
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,120
The rumor of the Great Qi is coming.

488
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,120
He has a big plan.

489
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,120
I'm afraid it's not just a few lives.

490
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,120
It's so simple.

491
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,120
But he's so generous.

492
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,120
He's not afraid of the fact that the plan has not been accomplished.

493
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,120
He's like a pharaoh.

494
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,120
Night Kill is smart.

495
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,120
He thinks he's done everything.

496
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,120
But he only calculated one thing.

497
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,120
What is it?

498
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,120
Me?

499
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,240
Me?

500
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,240
Are you the one who's selfish

501
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,240
or Night Kill is the one who's selfish?

502
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,240
Don't worry.

503
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,240
I'm sure I can get him.

504
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,240
Let's go.

505
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,240
Where?

506
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,240
It's so dark.

507
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,240
Of course we should go home.

508
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,240
But we didn't find anything.

509
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,240
We need to rest even if we didn't find anything.

510
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,240
We can go to Yuan Yang House tomorrow morning.

511
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,240
Why go to Yuan Yang House?

512
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,240
There's a case at Yuan Yang House.

513
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,240
Of course it's to buy someone

514
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,240
his favorite first-class peach blossom cake.

515
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,240
Go.

516
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,240
Junior, you too.

517
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,240
Catch it.

518
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,240
Master Shen,

519
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,240
you're not a good person.

520
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,240
But you should keep your peace.

521
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,240
You should report to the people

522
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,240
and don't leave the capital for now.

523
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,240
Ridiculous!

524
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,240
If Night Kill really wants to kill me,

525
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,240
how long can you hold me back?

526
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,240
Ten years?

527
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,240
I'm going to wait.

528
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,240
I'm going to wait.

529
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,240
I'm going to wait.

530
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,240
I'm going to wait.

531
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,240
I'm going to wait.

532
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,240
I'm going to wait.

533
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,240
I'm going to wait.

534
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,240
I'm going to wait.

535
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,240
I'm going to wait.

536
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,240
I'm going to wait.

537
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,240
I'm going to wait.

538
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,360
Ten years?

539
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,360
Do I have to live under your supervision?

540
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,360
What's the difference

541
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,360
between me and your prisoner?

542
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,360
All right.

543
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,360
I'm willing to devote my life to the society.

544
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,360
Tomorrow morning, I must leave the capital.

545
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,360
Master Shen.

546
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,360
Master,

547
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,360
Master Shen is right.

548
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,360
It's useless to keep him here.

549
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,360
I agree.

550
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,360
Master,

551
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,360
I have a trick

552
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,360
to keep Master Shen safe.

553
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,480
Xiao Bei Ming has been to so many places

554
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,480
in a day.

555
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,480
He's been walking around and talking.

556
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,480
What useful clues can he find?

557
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,480
Although His Majesty gave this case to Shen Buying,

558
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,480
our An Zhenying will never give up.

559
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,480
All these years,

560
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,480
Shen Buying has been holding our An Zhenying's head.

561
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,480
If we break this case again,

562
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,600
we will have a hard time

563
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,600
in the future.

564
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,600
Father, you're right.

565
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,600
This case is very important.

566
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,600
If we can break this case

567
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,600
before Xiao Bei Ming,

568
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,600
His Majesty will not only not blame us,

569
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,600
but will also reward us.

570
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,600
We can't afford to lose.

571
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,600
We can't afford to lose.

572
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,600
But this case

573
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,600
has been handed over to Shen Buying.

574
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,600
We can't just go and investigate it.

575
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,720
How can we get the clues?

576
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,720
Why do you support Master Shen leaving the capital?

577
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,720
Once he leaves,

578
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,720
we can't protect him.

579
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,720
Tomorrow is the third day.

580
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,720
If something happens,

581
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,720
it will be troublesome.

582
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,720
Of course I know.

583
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,720
So you...

584
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,720
So you have to find Master as soon as possible.

585
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,720
Stay with Master and his men in the Shen Mansion

586
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,720
to protect Master Shen.

587
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,720
Do you have any plans to hide from me?

588
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,720
How is that possible?

589
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,720
By the way,

590
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,720
do you have any money?

591
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,720
You don't tell me anything.

592
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,720
I have no money.

593
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,720
I didn't mean to.

594
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,840
I didn't mean to.

595
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,840
It's just an opportunity.

596
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,840
I have something important to do later.

597
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,840
I'll tell you when I'm done.

598
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,840
Okay?

599
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,840
Brother.

600
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,840
Something happened to Fang Ying in the casino.

601
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,840
Sister, I have something important to do.

602
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,840
I'll tell you when I'm back.

603
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,840
No.

604
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,840
Yanzi.

605
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,840
Don't move.

606
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,840
I will pay back

607
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,840
in the name of Shen Buying.

608
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,840
Please let me go.

609
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,820
Yanzi.

610
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,840
Help.

611
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,840
Help.

612
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,840
Someone is here.

613
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,840
Brother,

614
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,840
brother, help me.

615
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,840
The owner wants to see my hand.

616
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,840
You lost, right?

617
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,840
Which one is missing again?

618
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,840
Your good brother bet money from me

619
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,840
and lost 500 taels.

620
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,840
Now you say you don't have money to give me.

621
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,840
According to the rules of the gambling house,

622
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,840
I want to cut five fingers of his hand

623
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,840
to pay off the gambling debt.

624
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,840
How much?

625
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,120
Don't listen to him.

626
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,240
He's trying to trick me.

627
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,040
Don't move.

628
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,720
500 taels?

629
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,040
You can't even pay off

630
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,280
Shen Bo Yin's interest?

631
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,600
500 taels for five fingers.

632
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,840
You don't want to?

633
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,080
Go ahead.

634
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,040
Xiao Bei Ming.

635
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,600
Are you talking about me?

636
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,720
I'm the vice chief of Shen Bo Yin.

637
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,200
If you don't die soon,

638
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,560
he won't spare you.

639
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,280
What are you talking about?

640
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,320
You're the one who broke the trap.

641
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,680
Your uncle can't blame me for it.

642
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,760
Besides,

643
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,640
500 taels for five fingers.

644
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,320
You don't want to?

645
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,640
If I kill a young man,

646
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,080
I'll cut your fingers.

647
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,160
Junior Xiao,

648
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,400
we're talking about this again.

649
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,840
You can save him.

650
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,120
Senior,

651
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,480
this bastard

652
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,840
is using his uncle as a scapegoat.

653
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,400
He always causes trouble for us.

654
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,360
He's dead.

655
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,800
He can't be a agent anymore.

656
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,360
We've got a few cases to investigate.

657
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,640
We need a scapegoat.

658
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,760
Isn't that great?

659
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,720
Xiao Bei Ming,

660
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,200
you...

661
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,440
You're not a man!

662
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,760
Hit him on the mouth.

663
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,440
Move.

664
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,520
No.

665
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,040
No.

666
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,560
He...

667
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,480
I'll kill him!

668
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:40,960
Stop!

669
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,720
Coward.

670
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,400
Mr. Zhuo,

671
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,920
what are you doing?

672
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,080
You're being too kind.

673
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,040
You want to use my hand to cut off one finger.

674
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,640
I won't spare him.

675
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,120
You're saying

676
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,280
he owes you.

677
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,720
You want to cut off his finger.

678
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,280
What does that have to do with me?

679
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,320
Alright.

680
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,440
Stop pretending.

681
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,280
You know

682
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,960
I'm here to lure you out.

683
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,200
You're here for me.

684
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,680
It's not a secret.

685
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,640
Let's make it clear this time.

686
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,760
Don't try to hit my senior brother again.

687
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,400
You're willing to cooperate?

688
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,000
It's a deal.

689
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,480
No.

690
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:31,760
Hey.

691
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,480
If you dare to step into the gambling house again,

692
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,040
I'll break your legs.

693
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:37,920
I...

694
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,760
I know, Senior.

695
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,720
I won't do it again.

696
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,480
Send him back.

697
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,800
Yes.

698
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,360
You...

699
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,920
Alright.

700
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,480
Now it's just the two of us.

701
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,440
Let's bet.

702
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,360
What?

703
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,280
It's simple.

704
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,520
The size of the pen.

705
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,080
If you lose,

706
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,320
give me all the clues about the Ye's case.

707
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,200
So straightforward?

708
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,440
It's too dangerous to deal with a person like you.

709
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,960
It's better to just go straight.

710
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,480
But what if you lose?

711
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,200
Is that enough?

712
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,640
What do you think?

713
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,400
Just a little bit of luck.

714
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,720
I dare to invite you into my gambling house.

715
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,320
I also dare to take your bet.

716
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,720
I'm afraid you can't afford it.

717
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,400
You've known me for so many years.

718
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,120
When will you accept me?

719
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,560
What's your bet?

720
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,080
You know,

721
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,920
I'm getting married in a few days.

722
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,360
If you lose,

723
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,920
I want you to sign on the day of my wedding.

724
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,120
Okay.

725
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,160
Thank you.

726
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:12,800
Junior.

727
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,400
You lost.

728
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,400
What's this?

729
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,400
Open it!

730
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,400
Open it!

731
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,400
Open it!

732
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,400
Open it!

733
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,400
Open it!

734
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,400
Open it!

735
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,400
Open it!

736
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,400
Open it!

737
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,400
Open it!

738
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,400
Open it!

739
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,400
Okay.

740
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,400
Find a place to hide.

741
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,400
Tell me all the clues

742
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,400
you know.

743
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,400
Zhu Ge, Gu Yue.

744
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,400
Do you know why you haven't won against me

745
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,400
all these years?

746
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,400
Because you're too impatient.

747
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,400
What's this?

748
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,400
What's this?

749
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,400
What's this?

750
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,400
What's this?

751
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,400
You cheated.

752
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,400
It's not about the rules.

753
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,400
How can you cheat?

754
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,400
You're right.

755
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,400
I'm willing to admit defeat.

756
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,400
Because you're too relaxed.

757
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,400
How about this?

758
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,400
I'm in a good mood today.

759
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,400
I'll give you a clue.

760
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,400
We'll be together.

761
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,400
What?

762
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,400
Lord Shen is leaving Beijing tomorrow.

763
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,400
Thank you, Mr. Zhu Ge.

764
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,400
Remember to feed the horses early

765
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,400
on the day of the meeting.

766
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,400
My horse is stupid.

767
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,400
It's common for horses to lose their front legs.

768
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,400
Congratulations!

769
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,400
Congratulations!

770
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,400
All of them.

771
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,400
Thank you.

772
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,400
One for each.

773
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,400
Be careful.

774
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,400
Thank you, Mr. Zhu Ge.

775
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,400
Thank you.

776
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,400
Here.

777
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,400
You're so kind.

778
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,400
All of them.

779
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,400
Here.

780
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,400
Thank you, Mr. Zhu Ge.

781
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,400
Thank you, Mr. Feng.

782
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,400
Thank you, Mr. Feng.

783
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,400
Thank you, Mr. Feng.

784
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,400
Are you so proud?

785
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,400
Why are you here?

786
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,400
Everyone is watching the house.

787
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,400
They dare not blink.

788
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,400
They're afraid of trouble.

789
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,400
How dare you come here?

790
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,400
Don't worry.

791
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,400
I didn't come here.

792
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,400
He was the one who dragged me here.

793
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,400
Zhu Ge, Kong Que.

794
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,400
What do you want?

795
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,400
You know that

796
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,400
the Shen Buying has an important matter.

797
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,400
You dragged my senior

798
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,400
to play here.

799
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,400
Even if you don't care about the big picture,

800
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,400
you're so selfish

801
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,400
and want to use some tricks.

802
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,400
Please take your time

803
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,400
to think about it.

804
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,400
Do you believe that I'll teach you a lesson for your father?

805
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,400
Yes.

806
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,400
It's not the time.

807
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,400
Why do you still want to drag me to gamble?

808
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,400
Fu Zi is right.

809
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,400
Only women and men can be together.

810
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,400
Okay.

811
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,400
I won't waste my time on you.

812
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,400
Goodbye.

813
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,400
Junior, don't be angry.

814
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,400
Next time I see him,

815
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,400
I'll scold him for you.

816
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,400
What do you think?

817
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,400
Why are you still here?

818
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,400
I'm on the wrong way.

819
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,400
Xiao Bei Ming,

820
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,400
you should know that

821
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,400
on the way to the capital,

822
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,400
it's the best time for Ye Sha

823
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,400
to take action against Shen Da Ren.

824
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,400
I'm afraid that

825
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,400
there's no victory

826
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,400
if only one Shen Buying wins.

827
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,400
This is a gamble.

828
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,400
But it's Shen Da Ren's life

829
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,400
that's being bet on.

830
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,400
It could also be

831
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,400
your master's life.

832
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,400
No.

833
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,400
It's Ye Sha's.

834
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,400
Xiao Bei Ming,

835
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,400
no one can keep winning.

836
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,400
If you lose this time,

837
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,400
you'll be doomed.

838
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,400
I'm looking forward to it.

839
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,400
Let's see

840
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,400
if it'll be easier than winning you.

841
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,400
See you.

842
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,400
Since I was a kid,

843
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,400
there's not a word

844
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,400
that's funny to Brother Zhu.

845
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,400
Okay, let's not talk about him.

846
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,400
Junior,

847
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,400
why are you looking for me?

848
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,400
Didn't you ask me to borrow money?

849
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,400
Brother Zhu has already

850
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,400
checked the money bag.

851
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,400
He's so kind?

852
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,400
It's not cheap.

853
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,400
By the way,

854
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,400
go back to the God's Mansion.

855
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,400
I have something to do.

856
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,400
But...

857
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,400
Don't worry.

858
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,400
God's Mansion

859
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,400
What a good morning.

860
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,400
Which one should we follow?

861
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,400
That one.

862
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,400
That one?

863
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,400
Why?

864
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,400
The one on the car is

865
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,400
Zhong Xue Man.

866
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,400
Xiao Bei Ming

867
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,400
will never let Zhong Xue Man

868
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,400
shoot alone.

869
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,400
She must be in that carriage.

870
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,400
It's you again.

871
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,400
You bought the wine.

872
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,400
You're so stupid.

873
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,400
Come on.

874
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,400
You're not going to win.

875
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,400
You're not going to win.

876
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,400
Stop it.

877
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,400
Stop it.

878
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,400
Come on.

879
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,400
Come on.

880
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:41,260
How

881
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,840
could you do this?

882
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,400
You could kill him.

883
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,540
You could crash yourAgencies in blocks.

884
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,820
You don't know.

885
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:52,720
The street ahead is where the first

886
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,720
minister is holding a birthday party.

887
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,720
If you say a few words of goodwill,

888
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,720
you can get a red envelope.

889
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,720
I'm not telling you.

890
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,720
It's too late.

891
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,720
It's really lively.

892
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:05,720
Li Long, go to the camp and call some people.

893
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,720
What's wrong, young master?

894
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,720
Just now, the crowd was not looking for it.

895
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,720
It is very likely that the night kill has already

896
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,720
broken the four horses' clothing.

897
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,720
If you want to do it,

898
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,720
it's the best time to go out of the city.

899
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,720
Why don't we go to the capital?

900
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,920
We are helping ourselves.

901
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,920
Xiao Bei obviously wants to break the trap.

902
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:20,160
Let's give him a yellow

903
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,160
and white.

904
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,160
Young master, you're wise.

905
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,160
Senior brother, the city is about to leave the front.

906
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,160
Be careful.

907
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,160
It is the most dangerous thing to leave the city.

908
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,160
Okay.

909
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,160
Go.

910
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,160
Go.

911
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,160
Go.

912
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,160
Go.

913
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,160
Go.

914
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,160
Go.

915
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,160
Go.

916
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,160
Go.

917
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,160
Go.

918
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,160
Go.

919
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,160
Go.

920
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,160
Go.

921
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,160
Go.

922
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,160
Go.

923
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,160
Go.

924
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,160
Go.

925
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,160
Go.

926
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,160
Go.

927
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,160
Go.

928
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,160
Go.

929
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,160
Go.

930
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,160
Go.

931
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,160
Go.

932
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,160
Go.

933
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,160
Go.

934
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,160
Go.

935
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,160
Go.

936
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,160
Go.

937
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,160
Go.

938
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,160
Go.

939
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,160
What happened?

940
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,960
The night killer was a secret weapon master.

941
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,160
I saw him in a vent

942
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,400
