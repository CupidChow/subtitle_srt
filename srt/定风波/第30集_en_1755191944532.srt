[The Wanted Detective]

00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:37,970
[Episode 30]

3
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,430
How could my father have

4
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,070
the key to this secret chamber?

5
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:43,789
Master was once

6
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:45,390
a member of the Canfeng Army.

7
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,870
He must have had

8
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,400
some connection with Bei Hai

9
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,479
at Haiya back then.

10
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,350
You just said

11
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:53,200
you figured out Bei Hai's identity.

12
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,000
Who is he?

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,950
I believe

14
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:58,110
he's my Junior Master Uncle.

15
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:59,590
Isn't Old Bug

16
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,430
your only Master Uncle?

17
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,640
Junior Master Uncle

18
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,150
left Poison Valley long ago.

19
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,560
I've never even met him.

20
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,200
I only know from my master

21
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,400
that he had a junior

22
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,910
who was a prodigy.

23
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,910
His talent for alchemy and poison-making

24
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,240
surpassed both Old Bug

25
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,910
and my master combined.

26
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,310
He was the most

27
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,040
valued disciple in the valley.

28
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,870
But then something happened

29
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,329
and he left Poison Valley.

30
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,430
Are you saying

31
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,310
Bei Hai was poisoned
with the Separation Powder?

32
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:25,910
Yes.

33
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,090
I've only heard that

34
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,750
he traveled extensively

35
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,410
and once brought back a woman.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,060
He and that woman fell deeply in love.

37
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,180
But unexpectedly,

38
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,840
this woman turned out to be a spy

39
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,170
sent from another sect.

40
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,120
Master.

41
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,430
Lian has already

42
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,520
cut ties with them.

43
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,030
I beg you, for my sake,

44
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,740
please give us your blessing.

45
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,670
[Panacea]

46
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,870
Junior Master Uncle
couldn't bring himself to harm her.

47
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,590
In the end,

48
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,240
the Valley Chief poisoned her himself.

49
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,590
The poison used

50
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,650
was the Separation Powder.

51
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,240
No one expected

52
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,630
that Junior Master Uncle's feelings

53
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,960
for that woman would be so deep.

54
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,190
To save her,

55
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,750
he knelt outside my master's door

56
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,240
for a day and a night.

57
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,030
My master had read the Yin-Yang Book

58
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,520
and knew the antidote.

59
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,800
But my master couldn't

60
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,280
disobey the Valley Chief's orders.

61
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,150
In the end, Junior Master Uncle

62
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,840
actually tested the poison on himself,

63
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,170
gambling with his life,

64
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,430
and successfully neutralized the poison.

65
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,680
But after curing the poison,

66
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,079
Junior Master Uncle took that woman

67
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,150
and fled from the valley,

68
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,880
disappearing without a trace.

69
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,680
Testing poison on himself
and gambling with his life...

70
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,490
He had already made this decision

71
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,750
before he came.

72
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,030
If he had failed,

73
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,670
he might have died together

74
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,650
with that woman.

75
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,079
Such confidence,

76
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,840
such profound love!

77
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,079
The reason I suspect

78
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,560
this person is my junior master uncle

79
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,210
is because he's the only one who could

80
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:03,910
neutralize the Separation Powder.

81
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,910
I can't think of anyone else

82
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,520
who could

83
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,870
use this poison to create such a puzzle.

84
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,590
Bei Hai's underground chamber

85
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,590
was very likely prepared for

86
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,390
the disciples of Poison Valley.

87
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,040
I can't make sense

88
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,640
of all these clues right now.

89
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,450
Let's keep moving forward.

90
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,270
Here's a torch.

91
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:46,920
It works.

92
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,390
Over here.

93
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,800
Tong Shuang.

94
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,800
Let's split up and search.

95
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,510
Okay.

96
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,510
Look here.

97
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,120
A female corpse.

98
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,040
A male corpse.

99
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,880
They should be Bei Hai and his wife.

100
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,310
Looks like they've been dead

101
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,510
for about 20 years.

102
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,120
Lying here behind so many mechanisms,

103
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,260
what secret were they hiding?

104
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,730
There's a piece of cloth here.

105
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,720
The 36th year of Ningtai.

106
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,950
Come look at this.

107
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:59,630
Let's go.

108
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,190
The 36th year of Ningtai,

109
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,630
the Emperor was gravely ill.

110
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,760
Turmoil spread throughout the court.

111
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,950
The five border nations,
with their predatory ambitions,

112
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,240
formed an alliance and attacked
without declaration of war.

113
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,120
Border troops retreated,
civilians were displaced,

114
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,520
predators ruled, and the nation crumbled.

115
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,240
Just as the empire was about to collapse,

116
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,650
a miraculous pill was discovered.

117
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,820
[Swift Wind Pill]

118
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,320
The Swift Wind Pill.

119
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,430
If this pill could be obtained,

120
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,760
it could turn the tides.

121
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,630
However, no one anticipated

122
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,240
this would be
the beginning of a nightmare.

123
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,630
You claim this pill can help

124
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:45,390
the Qi Kingdom turn the tides.

125
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,560
Do you know that deceiving the Emperor

126
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,040
is punishable by death?

127
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,120
This humble subject

128
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,630
would never dare deceive Your Majesty.

129
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,159
Tell me,

130
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,390
what exactly are
the miraculous effects of this pill?

131
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,720
I shall boldly demonstrate it.

132
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,120
Select a brave warrior
of the Qi Kingdom

133
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,430
and have him take this pill.

134
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,890
Then Your Majesty
will witness its effects.

135
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,870
Begin.

136
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,840
Good.

137
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:38,909
Excellent.

138
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,120
I am fine.

139
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,450
I never expected this medicine

140
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,750
could enable one man to fight ten.

141
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,870
We'll definitely be able to
reclaim our lost territories.

142
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,780
Heaven truly blesses the Qi Kingdom.

143
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,260
My loyal minister,

144
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,440
what is

145
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,910
this medicine called?

146
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,320
Swift Wind Pill.

147
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,990
His Majesty believed

148
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,010
I was capable of saving the world.

149
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,390
I spared no effort, working tirelessly

150
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,970
day and night to create it.

151
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,630
It seems Bei Hai has recorded

152
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,840
everything that happened back then.

153
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,550
This is what he went to such lengths

154
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,590
and created so many obstacles

155
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,950
to hide in this place.

156
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,240
The situation was dire.

157
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,760
I dared not be negligent.

158
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,080
The troops guarding Haiya

159
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,750
were called the Canfeng Army,

160
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,510
commanded by Prince Wu Lie.

161
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,480
They numbered one thousand strong.

162
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,750
They took the pill before battle,

163
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,210
vowing to defeat the enemy

164
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,670
to protect our homeland.

165
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,280
Then they secretly crossed the border,

166
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,720
traveling day and night.

167
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,400
[Canfeng Army]

168
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,510
Sandstorms raged without stop,

169
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,600
so the allied forces' defenses were lax.

170
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,690
We launched a surprise attack.

171
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,200
Though we lost 800 men,

172
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,870
we killed the leaders

173
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,510
of all five enemy states.

174
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,630
The imperial army
launched a counterattack.

175
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,440
The civilians

176
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,870
welcomed us with food and drink.

177
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,710
[Canfeng Army]

178
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:54,030
[Canfeng Army]

179
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,790
Just as the soldiers were about to rest,

180
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,230
unexpected troubles arose again.

181
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,480
After the Canfeng Army returned to Haiya,

182
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,280
only 200 remained.

183
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,450
But later,

184
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,360
someone suddenly went berserk

185
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,160
and attacked in all directions.

186
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,080
So this is

187
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,850
the hidden history?

188
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,540
Those three doors earlier

189
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,360
must have been designed

190
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,760
to protect this history.

191
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,270
Sometimes lucid, sometimes deranged...

192
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,780
What's really going on?

193
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,970
I've never seen symptoms
like these before.

194
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,510
Could it be because...

195
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,120
The number of casualties increased daily.

196
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,000
Only then did I realize

197
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,440
that the Swift Wind Pill was the cause.

198
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,580
I've roamed the martial world for decades,

199
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,210
priding myself on unmatched poison skills.

200
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,360
But when the moment came,

201
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,440
I realized the art of medicine

202
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,870
was as deep as the ocean.

203
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,270
Thus, I exhausted all my knowledge

204
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,270
to search for an antidote.

205
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:35,020
Little did I know
disaster was already upon us.

206
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,120
He's finally come to his senses.

207
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,680
Your diagnosis was correct.

208
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,000
It was indeed the Swift Swift Wind Pill

209
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,510
that caused his symptoms.

210
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,840
After taking the Swift Wind Pill,

211
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,240
it causes rapid physical changes.

212
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,230
I thought after stopping the medication,

213
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,290
one would recover.

214
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,630
But the Swift Wind Pill's potency
runs deep,

215
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,630
generating its own toxicity.

216
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,600
Once discontinued,

217
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,200
the meridians cannot adapt.

218
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,550
The stimulated internal energy

219
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,630
rampages chaotically
through the meridians.

220
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,630
The toxins then surge into
the brain tissue,

221
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,270
causing hallucinations.

222
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,720
While hallucinating,

223
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,000
they perceive everything around them

224
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,200
as threats

225
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,150
and attack without mercy.

226
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,390
More and more people are affected.

227
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,000
Many have been bitten by them.

228
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,030
Did you follow

229
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,080
Master Bei Hai's instructions?

230
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,670
Yes,

231
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,270
they were lucid after taking it,

232
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,400
but after a few days,

233
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,790
they went mad again.

234
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,530
So he wasn't cured.

235
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,910
Instead, you gave him

236
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,770
even more Swift Swift Wind Pills.

237
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,080
You must know that

238
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,790
if the toxin isn't neutralized,

239
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,200
continuing to take the pills

240
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,720
may temporarily relieve symptoms,

241
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,670
but it'll worsen the poisoning.

242
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,240
Once the toxin penetrates the bones,

243
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,600
the consequences will be devastating.

244
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,630
I'm well aware of that,

245
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,910
which is why I must quickly find

246
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:37,910
an antidote.

247
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,240
Until then,

248
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,720
we can only continue using
the Swift Wind Pills

249
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,360
to keep him temporarily lucid.

250
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,240
It's our only option.

251
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,240
What about

252
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,650
the other Canfeng Army soldiers?

253
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,750
What should we do?

254
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,910
The number of poisoned soldiers

255
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,840
is increasing.

256
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And we're running out of pills.

257
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,200
Has there been any response
from the capital?

258
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,240
My Lords,

259
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:05,390
the Haiya matter cannot be delayed.

260
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,910
His Majesty is currently unwell.

261
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,510
I'm afraid we must make a decision

262
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,000
on His Majesty's behalf.

263
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,510
This is a serious matter.

264
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,440
I'm just concerned that...

265
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,630
His Majesty has already issued the decree.

266
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,240
The Crown Prince is too young.

267
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,700
For urgent state affairs,

268
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,390
we may deliberate and decide.

269
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,150
That may be so,

270
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,080
but we should...

271
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,750
No need for further discussion.

272
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,960
The situation is urgent.

273
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,720
If we hesitate,

274
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,030
wouldn't we be failing
His Majesty's trust?

275
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,990
Indeed.

276
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,550
Mr. Shen,

277
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,390
if you have any good suggestions,
please speak freely.

278
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,920
The four of us
will share the responsibility.

279
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,390
Yes, indeed.

280
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,960
The most urgent task now

281
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,880
is to contain this information

282
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,790
and absolutely prevent

283
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,720
news of the Canfeng Army's disease

284
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,750
from spreading beyond Haiya.

285
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,120
Contain the information?

286
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,360
The situation has just stabilized

287
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,600
with complete victory at the border.

288
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,670
There's growing public support.

289
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:06,150
The matter of the Swift Wind Pill
is top secret.

290
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,270
If the citizens of Qi Kingdom learn

291
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,840
that our heroic soldiers have

292
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,910
turned into mindless beasts overnight,

293
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:16,070
it will certainly
cause panic among the people

294
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,870
and damage the imperial court's authority.

295
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,230
There are rumors that

296
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,550
Bei Hai is already developing an antidote.

297
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,670
What if

298
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,200
he can't develop an antidote in time?

299
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,540
By that time,

300
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,000
the Qi Kingdom will face

301
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,600
200 men who have lost their minds

302
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,390
and become incredibly violent monsters.

303
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,360
They possess immense strength,

304
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,620
kill without remorse,

305
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,960
and fear no death.

306
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,550
I'm afraid it will lead to

307
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,870
an unwithstandable catastrophe.

308
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,480
Our current plan,

309
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,600
besides containing information

310
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,630
and urging Bei Hai to develop an antidote,

311
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,790
must also include contingencies

312
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,240
if no antidote is found.

313
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,790
My Lords,

314
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,150
His Majesty
just regained consciousness briefly.

315
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,880
Does His Majesty have an order?

316
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:08,530
[Kill]

317
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,390
Strategist,

318
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,870
is there truly no other way?

319
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,320
The imperial command cannot be defied.

320
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,600
But they are all our brothers

321
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:20,120
who have fought alongside us
through thick and thin

322
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,850
and achieved such great merit
for the Qi Kingdom.

323
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:23,630
How can we

324
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,290
bring ourselves to kill them?

325
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,810
Strategist,

326
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,030
could we send a message by carrier pigeon

327
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,890
and plead with His Majesty again?

328
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,720
General,

329
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,200
you understand His Majesty's mind best.

330
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,320
Is this possible?

331
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,390
Since the imperial decree has been issued,

332
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,630
there's no need to discuss this further.

333
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:44,560
Relay my orders.

334
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,360
General,

335
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,910
allow me to see Bei Hai

336
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,150
one last time.

337
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:55,910
Bei Hai,

338
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,490
how is the antidote coming along?

339
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,240
You created the pill,

340
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,600
yet even you can't neutralize it?

341
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,390
The poison has already penetrated

342
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,790
into the bone marrow of these 200 men.

343
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,190
There's nothing I can do.

344
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,400
How many Swift Wind Pills are left?

345
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,210
Only enough for them
to take one last dose.

346
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:14,750
But even if they take more
Swift Wind Pills,

347
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,790
they can now barely maintain clarity

348
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,109
for half a day.

349
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,880
After half a day,

350
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,760
they will completely transform

351
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,349
into beasts.

352
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,140
Any news from the capital?

353
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,160
Report!

354
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,830
General, the city is surrounded.

355
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:47,960
Go ahead.

356
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,680
Attack!

357
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,690
Kill them quickly!

358
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,640
General,

359
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,440
we've lost contact with
the two additional teams

360
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,040
we just sent in.

361
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,710
General, should I

362
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,400
lead another team inside?

363
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,960
How many men do we have left?

364
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,070
Only two battalions left.

365
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,780
They've completely lost their minds

366
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,200
and are now scattered throughout the city.

367
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,640
Once the fighting gets to the alleys,

368
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,070
sending more men in

369
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,610
would just be sending them
to their deaths.

370
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,400
Canfeng Army, attention!

371
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,350
-Yes!
-Yes!

372
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,200
Withdraw all forces outside the city,

373
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,160
lock the gates,

374
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,850
and allow no one to leave.

375
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,720
General,

376
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,510
there are still innocent civilians inside,

377
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,680
thousands of elderly, children, and women

378
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,680
who have no way to defend themselves

379
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,110
against those savage beasts.

380
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,680
They're facing certain death.

381
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,830
I request permission
to lead troops back in.

382
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,110
Even if we die fighting,

383
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,350
we must rescue

384
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,770
these civilians first!

385
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,240
General!

386
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,710
-General!
-General!

387
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,680
Wu Lie's order

388
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,030
caused the people of Haiya

389
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,030
to be like fish awaiting slaughter,

390
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,590
while the men who've gone mad

391
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:38,160
massacred all
until nothing was left to be killed.

392
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,890
Then they turned on each other,

393
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:43,400
turning Haiya into hell on earth.

394
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,510
Turned into hell...

395
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,120
There should still be

396
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,110
survivors who escaped this catastrophe.

397
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:40,750
General,

398
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,680
there's still time to save them.

399
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,480
Go find

400
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,030
all those civilians.

401
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,070
Yes.

402
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,610
Kill without mercy,

403
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,400
General!

404
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,240
Execute the military order.

405
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:50,960
General,

406
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,000
Haiya's chaos has been quelled.

407
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,240
Why must we slaughter the innocent?

408
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,000
Because they

409
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,960
must die.

410
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,610
His Majesty is gravely ill
with little time left.

411
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,200
The Crown Prince is young
with no power base.

412
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,880
Internally, the nobles are restless,

413
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,920
and externally, our enemies
are watching like tigers.

414
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,680
If what happened in Haiya leaked out,

415
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,510
it would certainly be exploited
by those with ulterior motives.

416
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,110
The country would be thrown into chaos,

417
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,920
the entire nation in turmoil.

418
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,320
Who would bear the crime?

419
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,350
But these people of Haiya

420
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,200
are also citizens of the Qi Kingdom.

421
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,030
I know.

422
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,070
Of course I know.

423
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,890
They are citizens of the Qi Kingdom

424
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,030
and all are innocent people.

425
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,680
I know that once this order is given,

426
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,320
there's no turning back.

427
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,480
But for the sake of the entire Qi Kingdom,

428
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,110
for the sake of even more innocent lives,

429
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:46,550
I...

430
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,750
I have no choice.

431
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,960
After this is done,

432
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,440
I will personally ask His Majesty
for punishment.

433
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,680
I will bear

434
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,280
all responsibility alone.

435
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,300
Execute the order.

436
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,480
General!

437
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,400
Those who disobey...

438
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,440
Will be executed!

439
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,160
Put that baby down.

440
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,720
-General said we can’t keep any of them.
-He’s just a baby.

441
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,750
I said put him down!

442
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,640
Yunchi,

443
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,350
put the baby down!

444
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,310
Yunchi,

445
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,510
I know you're upset,

446
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,280
but what the General said

447
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:17,790
isn't wrong.

448
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,070
But we are human beings!

449
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,110
We're not animals.

450
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,160
Yunchi, give me the baby!

451
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,030
[Tong Xin]

452
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:25,790
No!

453
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,110
What for?

454
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,610
For you to kill him?

455
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,720
Can an infant reveal secrets,

456
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,250
or threaten the Qi Kingdom?

457
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:38,640
We're committing such terrible sins.

458
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,550
Heaven will surely punish us.

459
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,000
Zongyao,

460
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,180
your family is waiting for you to return.

461
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,720
Tong,

462
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,160
isn't your wife

463
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,160
newly with child?

464
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,030
Let us

465
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,590
spare some lives in Haiya.

466
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,240
Just treat it as...

467
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,100
As building some good karma
for our families, okay?

468
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,030
If the General truly blames someone,

469
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,450
I'll take all responsibility.

470
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,480
I won't implicate any of you.

471
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,400
I knew it had to be you.

472
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,200
Looking back now,

473
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,830
those years I roamed

474
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,770
the martial world with you,

475
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,270
cracking criminal cases,

476
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,130
were the happiest days of my life.

477
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,440
It's just a pity

478
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,200
that I don't have time

479
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,150
to share one last drink with you.

480
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,310
Can we go somewhere else?

481
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,640
I don't want them

482
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,240
to see me in my final moments.

483
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,550
I discovered this underground cave

484
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,160
by accident.

485
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,550
I spent several years

486
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,850
setting up mechanisms

487
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,960
to turn it into a secret chamber.

488
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,790
You've already seen

489
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,720
the way

490
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,920
to solve these mechanisms just now.

491
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,030
Why did you bring me here?

492
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,750
I caused the Haiya disaster.

493
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,680
Even if I die a thousand times,

494
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,590
it won't atone for my sin.

495
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,400
But before I die,

496
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,170
there are some things I must do.

497
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,510
And only you

498
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,000
can help me.

499
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,200
What can I do for you?

500
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,880
Three things.

501
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,640
First,

502
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,000
I want you to take
this Swift Wind Pill

503
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,070
to Poison Valley

504
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,340
and give it to my senior Wu Shuang.

505
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,680
The Poison Valley Chief?

506
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,350
Even if those

507
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,550
soldiers poisoned by the pill are dead,

508
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:38,830
I cannot guarantee

509
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:41,030
that the Swift Wind Pill
hasn't spread elsewhere.

510
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,890
If someone exploits this poison,

511
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,020
it can throw the world into chaos.

512
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,350
In the arts of medicine and poison,

513
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,810
the only one superior to me

514
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,270
is my senior.

515
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,440
Years ago, due to some past matters,

516
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,680
we became enemies.

517
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,200
But I know he is righteous.

518
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,920
He will certainly find a way

519
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,250
to develop an antidote.

520
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,460
Once there's an antidote,

521
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,010
the source of all calamity
will be cut off.

522
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,640
What's the second thing?

523
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,000
[Swift Wind Pill]

524
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,400
What is this?

525
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,590
These are

526
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,510
the things

527
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:32,370
that happened in Haiya recently.

528
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,480
Why did you

529
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,270
carve all this here?

530
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,270
If I'm not mistaken,

531
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,240
I fear Wu Lie

532
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,680
followed His Majesty's orders

533
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,140
to burn Haiya to the ground

534
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:41,790
and destroy

535
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,550
the mountain path leading there,

536
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,590
making Haiya

537
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,070
vanish from this world completely.

538
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,310
Aren't you worried

539
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:51,880
that I might destroy it?

540
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,790
You won't.

541
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,480
Why not?

542
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,350
Because you understand better than I do

543
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,030
that the poison in people's hearts

544
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,890
is worse than any poisonous pill.

545
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,960
Of all the people I know,

546
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,380
you're the worthiest
of being called a hero.

547
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,240
You know that even if

548
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,960
slaughter can temporarily stabilize
the situation,

549
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,880
covering up

550
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,110
has never been

551
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,480
a way to solve evil.

552
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,400
It only allows hatred to take root,

553
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,270
letting this blood feud

554
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,070
continue for generations,

555
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,510
until one day,

556
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:34,030
it creates an even greater disaster.

557
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,690
By then, even with an antidote,

558
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,400
the poison of hatred won't be cured.

559
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:43,240
Because the most poisonous thing
is the human heart.

560
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,440
Is this

561
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,270
the key to this secret chamber?

562
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,720
If my senior

563
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,590
spends his whole life and is still

564
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,550
unable to develop an antidote like me,

565
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,680
then this thumb ring

566
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,550
will be the hope I leave for Haiya

567
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,310
and the Qi Kingdom.

568
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:10,040
If disaster strikes again,

569
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,200
I hope you

570
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,750
can choose someone like yourself,

571
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,200
someone with a righteous heart,

572
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,130
and bring to this underground tomb

573
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,240
to open the secret chamber

574
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,440
and reveal the truth.

575
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,960
I've left the formula for
the Swift Wind Pill

576
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,960
here as well.

577
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,960
If they can't solve it either,

578
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,260
let them pass it on to future generations

579
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,670
until someone solves it.

580
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,240
When that time comes, I hope all the truth

581
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,550
will be revealed to the world.

582
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,410
This way, whether it's disasters

583
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,040
caused by the pill's poison
or by human hearts,

584
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,070
they might truly come to an end.

585
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,330
What's the third thing?

586
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,480
The third thing...

587
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,530
I beg you to protect my wife and children.

588
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,580
I deserve punishment.
My death matters little.

589
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,920
But they should live.

590
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,230
You must promise me this.

591
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,680
Darling.

592
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,350
You...

593
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,030
If I survive,

594
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,520
I'll only burden the children.

595
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,310
General.

596
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,310
The children...

597
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,070
I'll entrust them to you.

598
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:27,480
In my life, I've failed four people.

599
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,160
The first is my senior brother Wu Shuang,

600
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,240
to whom I owe everything.

601
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,040
His kindness is unforgettable,

602
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,000
but I was stubborn and arrogant,

603
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,570
and broke ties with him.

604
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,790
Second, my beloved wife Xiao,

605
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,510
deeply loving and loyal,

606
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,590
yet I must leave her behind.

607
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,350
And my sons Bei Kun and Bei Ming,

608
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,480
for having failed my duty as their father.

609
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,680
I scarred their shoulders with incense

610
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:53,350
to pray for their safety.

611
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,110
Beiming.

612
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,790
Bei Hai's child Bei Ming...

613
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,310
Could it be...

614
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,190
The King Zhong of Constables

615
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:23,030
didn't give you his surname Zhong

616
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:25,280
because your mother's surname was Xiao.

617
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,590
Mrs. Xiao's remains

618
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,150
are in this secret chamber.

619
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,190
This proves

620
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,420
she didn't choose to leave back then.

621
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,159
Instead, she stayed here

622
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,070
with Bei Hai.

623
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,540
If that's the case,

624
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,360
Beiming, you have

625
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,690
a brother named Bei Kun.

626
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,230
But my father only took you away

627
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,280
at that time.

628
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,080
We don't know where he went.

629
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,400
Only Wu Lie knows.

630
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:02,960
In any case,

631
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,030
he must also

632
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,190
be on that list.

633
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,510
It's just that

634
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,270
we don't know who adopted him

635
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,720
or what name he was given.

636
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,360
He is your only family.

637
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,310
We will definitely find him.

638
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,520
There's another stone wall over there.

639
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,880
So this is

640
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,880
the formula for the Swift Wind Pill.

641
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,360
Old Bug really was something.

642
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,360
He almost perfectly

643
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,000
replicated the Swift Wind Pill.

644
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,840
Bei Hai once had King Zhong of Constables

645
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,900
give the Swift Wind Pill to my master.

646
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:43,920
But Old Bug

647
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,400
killed my master before he could

648
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,800
create the antidote.

649
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,590
If he were still alive,

650
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,110
he would certainly have figured it out.

651
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,000
Don't be sad.

652
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:54,800
You were your master's

653
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,060
most prized disciple.

654
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,320
Our arrival here today

655
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,000
must be fate.

656
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,030
This is the important task

657
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,400
your master left for you,

658
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,510
and his dying wish.

659
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:07,230
But this formula is extremely important.

660
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,230
It must not fall into Yesha's hands.

661
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,280
You must commit it firmly to memory.

662
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,230
I also believe

663
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,670
that someday, you will definitely

664
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:14,930
develop the antidote.

665
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,110
It seems Bei Hai

666
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,480
left us a way back.

667
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,360
Beiming.

668
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,920
Take them with.

669
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:15,960
When you get back,

670
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,420
give them a proper burial.

671
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,000
They erected a blank tombstone
in the courtyard,

672
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,400
They probably wanted to rest here forever.

673
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,230
Let's go.

674
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,570
Look out!

675
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,040
Earthquake!
