Would you like some water?

125

That's all that matters.

I said, Papa Feng.

136

It's all my fault.

137
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,150
It's all my fault for arriving too late

that you bled so much

139

and almost died.

140
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,670
But I made a vow

141
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,270
that as long as you survive this,

142
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,200
I'll call you Papa Feng from now on.

143
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,440
Say it again.

144
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,360
Say it again.

00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,980
Listen carefully.

Madman!

148
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,250
That's enough.

149
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,240
Let him have a good rest.

150
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,840
We'll step outside.

151
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,510
Go to sleep.

152
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,960
So you're Yesha.

153
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,440
What does Yesha

154
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,440
have to do with me?

155
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,080
You know Old Bug, don't you?

156
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,480
He told us

157
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,030
everything about you.

158
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,840
And who is Old Bug?

159
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,630
I don't know him.

160
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,080
Then explain to me

161
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,410
what the red crystal is all about.

162
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,270
If you don't know Old Bug,

163
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,440
how would you know

164

how to refine it?

165
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,720
Red crystal?

166
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,360
And what on earth is red crystal?

167
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,960
I'll ask you one last time,

168
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,600
where is Yesha?

169
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,270
Come closer.

170
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,120
I'll whisper it to you.

171
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,200
Yesha

172
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,510
is Xiao Beiming.

173
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,030
It's all Xiao Beiming's orders.

174
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,940
Everyone under heaven knows that

175
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,910
Yesha is Xiao Beiming.

176
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:36,240
I am indeed Xiao Beiming's subordinate.

177
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,510
All my actions,

178
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,670
as well as
the entire Yellow Heaven's actions,

179
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,750
are all under Xiao Beiming's orders.

180
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,150
You asked me to tell you,

181
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,510
and I told you honestly,

182
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,470
but you wouldn't believe me.

183
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,490
Why is that?

184
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,510
You killed so many people

185
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,270
just to refine red crystal.

186
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,550
What was it all for?

187
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,850
Nothing special.

188
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,150
Just a personal preference.

189
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,650
What do you mean?

190
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,390
I mean

191
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,600
it was for fun.

192
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,360
Do you know

193
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,150
what the most pleasant sound

194
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,150
in this world is?

195
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,150
It's the sound a person makes
right before they die.

196
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,720
It's truly delightful.

197
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,280
From the begging

198
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,850
and pleading at the start,

199
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,080
to the crying

200
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,270
screaming,

201
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,750
and then finally

202
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,270
growing weaker

203
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,480
and weaker,

204
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,080
until there's no sound at all.

205
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,150
It's like hundreds of ants

206
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,840
crawling all over your body.

207
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,270
Truly beautiful.

208
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,630
Whether it's red crystal or not,

209
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,480
it doesn't matter to me.

210
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,670
What matters is

211
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:54,320
I enjoy watching them suffer.

212
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:04,080
Bad news.

213
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,320
Urgent message
from the Ministry of Justice.

214
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,320
We must escort Huang Wuchang
back to the capital for trial immediately.

215
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,960
You're awake.

216
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,090
How are you feeling?

217
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,080
Miss Huo.

218
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,630
Don't worry.

219
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,010
With my prescription,

220
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,750
I could even bring back someone

221
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,480
who's halfway in the grave.

222
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,730
Alright, alright.

223
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,230
You're the greatest.

224
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,120
Don't move around.

225
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,450
I'll get your medicine.

226
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,030
Where's Beiming?

227
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,750
How is he?

228
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,840
Is he alright?

229
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:58,720
He's alright.

230
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,700
I know what you're worried about.

231
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,520
But you've lost too much blood,

232
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,670
and your wounds haven't healed yet.

233
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,450
You need to take care of yourself first

234
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,150
before you can help him, right?

235
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,810
Don't move. Stay still.

236
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:13,910
No big deal.

237
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,790
I've just been lying down

238
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,960
for too long

239
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,800
and wanted to sit up for a bit.

240
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,270
Thanks.

241
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,270
Be careful.

242
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,120
I can manage on my own.

243
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:35,790
Don't move.

244
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,720
Here.

245
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,080
Miss Huo.

246
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:02,840
I...

247
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,480
What I wanted to say is that...

248
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,870
I'm deeply grateful for your kindness

249
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,270
and will never forget it.

250
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,960
Is gratitude all

251
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,080
you have to say to me?

252
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,030
No.

253
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,880
That's not what I meant.

254
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,840
Actually, I wanted to say...

255
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,550
T-Thanks.

256
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,720
You were actually a sweeter talker

257
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,250
when you were unconscious.

258
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,360
Unconscious?

259
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,150
What did I say when I was unconscious?

260
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,030
Nothing much,

261
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,370
just that you're a coward.

262
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,510
A coward?

263
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,060
Take your medicine first.

264
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,819
The Ministry of Justice has sent orders

265
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,220
to the Weizhou Garrison.

266
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,839
Wang Feihu will send people to escort you.

267
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,510
Your condition can't wait any longer.

268
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,589
You must go back quickly

269
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:17,720
and find Old Bug.

270
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,970
I can still tough it out.

271
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,880
Is Huang Wuchang still

272
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,960
not talking?

273
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,640
I've tried everything.

274
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,069
But fortunately,

275
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,960
although he identified

276
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,160
Xiao Beiming as Yesha,

277
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,560
he didn't recognize you.

278
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,510
Now that he's been captured,

279
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,750
once we return to the capital,

280
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,440
we'll find a way

281
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,510
to make him talk.

282
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,640
Whether Huang Wuchang is Yesha

283
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,030
still needs to be verified.

284
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,030
They previously refined
a large amount of red crystal,

285
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,880
and we still don't know
what they used it for.

286
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,480
There are still many

287
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,240
Yellow Heaven remnants at large.

288
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:47,910
I'm afraid this matter

289
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,570
won't be resolved so quickly.

290
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,200
I'll have the Weizhou Garrison
closely monitor

291
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,510
the movements of
the Yellow Heaven remnants

292
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,350
and report immediately
if there's any news.

293
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,720
We're the ones who caught him.

294
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,440
As long as I convince
the Ministry of Justice after we return

295
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,070
to let me interrogate Huang Wuchang,

296
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,330
everything will still be under control.

297
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,550
That's not right.

298
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,480
What's wrong?

299
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,000
Huang Wuchang is of great significance.

300
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,790
Wang Feihu would definitely

301
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,200
report it to the Ministry of Justice.

302
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,440
But the Ministry of Justice's response

303
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,510
came too quickly.

304
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,830
The round trip

305
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,570
would take at least two or three days.

306
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,200
Why did we receive
the Ministry of Justice's orders

307
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,400
right after we started interrogating?

308
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,530
Before we made the arrest,

309
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,960
someone had already guessed the outcome

310
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,480
and reported it
to the Ministry of Justice.

311
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,680
How is that possible?

312
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,310
Looks like trouble has come sooner
than expected.

313
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,160
Don't worry.

314
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,480
We'll deal with whatever comes our way.

315
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,610
We'll set off early tomorrow morning.

316
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,440
We're escorting a key criminal,

317
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,880
so everyone, stay alert!

318
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,750
Constable Zhong.

319
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,400
The distance from Weizhou to the capital

320
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,200
is quite long.

321
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,110
I can only

322
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,290
escort you this far.

323
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,510
Thank you for your help and care

324
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,960
these past few days, Constable Wang.

325
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,070
No need to thank me.

326
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,770
It's just what I should do.

327
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,510
But there's something I wanted to...

328
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,440
Constable Wang.

329
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,070
We've fought side by side,

330
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,360
so just speak freely.

331
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,920
In the case of eliminating Yellow Heaven,

332
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,310
the Elite Constabulary Unit
deserves the main credit,

333
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,870
but my men of the Weizhou Garrison

334
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,870
also contributed their fair share.

335
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,310
Some of my men

336
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:21,750
are still recovering from their wounds
at home.

337
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,550
I wonder

338
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,020
if, when you return to the capital

339
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,070
and meet the officials
at the Ministry of Justice,

340
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,370
you could put in a good word

341
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,970
for my men, Constable Zhong?

342
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,510
Of course I will.

343
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,050
If it weren't for you, Constable Wang,

344
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:35,640
and your men arriving in time,

345
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,160
let alone capturing Huang Wuchang,

346
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,720
we all

347
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,200
would have lost our lives.

348
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,970
Thanks a lot, Constable Zhong.

349
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,270
So,

350
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,160
as for the favor I asked of you,
Constable Wang...

351
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,070
Please rest assured.

352
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,310
Whenever I come across
any remnants of Yellow Heaven,

353
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,000
I'll arrest

354
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,560
every single one of them.

355
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,480
My Lord, someone's blocking our way.

356
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,210
Who would dare to block our way?

357
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,240
Could it be the remnants of Yellow Heaven?

358
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,170
They look like government troops.

359
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,830
Aren't we government troops ourselves?

360
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,830
No, it's not that.

361
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,050
Those people are...

362
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,160
Zhuge Kongyun?

363
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,050
I'm Zhuge Kongyun
from the Secret Investigation Unit.

364
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm here under orders

365
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,530
to escort the key criminal,
Huang Wuchang, back to the capital.

366
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,540
Young Master.

367
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,790
Coroner Feng's signing up as a sworn son?

368
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,050
What's this all about?

369
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,750
Do you want me to disguise myself
and sneak in

370
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,640
to check it out?

371
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:51,960
No need.

372
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,200
Go send a secret message to the unit

373
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,130
and request additional manpower.

374
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,260
Yes, Young Master.

375
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,480
Xiao Beiming.

376
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,510
The game has begun.

377
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,310
Zhuge Kongyun.

378
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,160
The Yellow Heaven cult

379
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,880
was eliminated by
our Elite Constabulary Unit,

380
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,860
and their leader Huang Wuchang

381
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,920
was captured by us.

382
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,350
Weizhou is not the capital,

383
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,440
and this is not a major case,
so there's no need

384
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,750
for the Secret Investigation Unit
to interfere.

385
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,920
I'm not trying to steal

386
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,550
the Elite Constabulary Unit's credit,

387
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,480
nor do I care about
the Yellow Heaven cult.

388
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,140
I'm only here to ask one thing:

389
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,310
is the key criminal, Huang Wuchang,

390
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,310
connected to Yesha or not?

391
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,150
To be honest,

392
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,310
I didn't want to

393
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,680
make this trip to Weizhou

394
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,070
and go through all this trouble.

395
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,670
But I received intelligence

396
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,720
indicating that

397
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,070
the Yellow Heaven cult

398
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,960
is likely connected to Yesha.

399
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Don't forget that

400
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,350
the Yesha case

401
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:51,080
is still under the jurisdiction of
our Secret Investigation Unit.

402
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,470
Constable Zhong,

403
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,440
we've worked on cases together before,

404
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,960
but you've repeatedly been dishonest

405
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,480
and played games with me.

406
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:02,240
To prevent further misunderstandings
between us,

407
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,920
I specifically reported to
the Ministry of Justice

408
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,850
and obtained official documents.

409
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,900
The documents clearly state

410
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,720
that the key criminal,
Huang Wuchang,

411
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,570
is to be handed over to
our Secret Investigation Unit.

412
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,190
[Ministry of Justice Permit]

413
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,030
Zhuge Kongyun.

414
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,540
How do you prove

415
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,310
that the key criminal
is connected to Yesha?

416
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,400
It's simple.

417
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,030
I'll know right after interrogation.

418
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,960
If you refuse to hand over
the key criminal

419
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,490
and defy orders from above,

420
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:30,750
the consequences...

421
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,200
What if your interrogation reveals

422
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,310
the suspect has no connection to Yesha?

423
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,720
False reporting of case details

424
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,320
will surely be dealt with
according to the law.

425
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,770
Constable Zhong, you're a smart person.

426
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,960
Rather than returning to the capital

427
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,270
and risking execution,

428
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,400
you might as well hand
the key criminal over to me

429
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,730
and see if I'll be the one

430
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,670
being executed instead.

431
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,270
Take your criminal

432
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,070
and leave now.

433
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,400
Constable Zhong,
you truly understand what's at stake.

434
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,240
Thanks a lot.

435
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,240
Take him away.

436
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,000
Farewell.

437
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,680
Hold on.

438
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,790
I've handed the criminal over to you.

439
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,000
What else do you want?

440
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,920
I heard that Coroner Feng and Miss Huo

441
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,400
have also come to Weizhou.

442
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,240
They're in the carriage, right?

443
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,750
Since we've all met before,

444
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,680
I'd better go over

445
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,680
and say hello.

446
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,190
That won't be necessary.

447
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,810
Just keep your men in line.

448
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,720
Proper etiquette

449
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,730
should still be observed.

450
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,270
I just remembered something.

451
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,770
I heard that Coroner Feng

452
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,400
nearly lost his life a few days ago
while working on this case in Weizhou.

453
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,480
Since Miss Huo

454
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,310
is in the carriage taking care of him,

455
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:55,350
I won't disturb them further.

456
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:04,790
Mr. Zhuge.

457
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,640
Thank you, Mr. Zhuge.

458
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,480
Sorry for my poor manners.

459
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,680
Get well soon.

460
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,370
What exactly is Zhuge Kongyun

461
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,920
up to?

462
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,360
Whatever he's planning,

463
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,830
fortunately, he didn't lift the curtain,

464
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,240
or we'd be in big trouble.

465
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,480
Thank goodness,

466
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,200
we dodged a bullet.

467
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,580
Fortunately, this Zhuge fellow

468
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,720
knows when to back off.

469
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,310
I already had my blade out.

470
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:04,150
If he dared to lift that curtain,

471
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,960
I would've chopped his hand off.

472
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,510
It's not that simple.

473
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,240
What do you mean?

474
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,910
From his choice of words,

475
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,310
I'm afraid he already knows

476
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,440
about my presence.

477
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,550
Perhaps he's been

478
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,880
in Weizhou for some time,

479
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,640
watching us from the shadows.

480
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,310
Then hasn't your cover been blown?

481
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,830
I can't figure it out either.

482
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,240
Taking away a minor henchman,
Huang Wuchang,

483
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,070
should be nothing compared to

484
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,720
capturing me, Yesha, myself.

485
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,790
If he had already discovered

486
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:29,590
my presence,

487
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,450
why didn't he make a move just now?

488
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,110
Could it be that he hadn't discovered you?

489
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:34,910
That's right.

490
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:35,980
He might not have guessed

491
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,110
that you're with us.

492
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,030
Let's hope so.

493
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,520
Young Master.

494
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,680
There must be something suspicious
about that carriage.

495
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,110
When you passed by the carriage,

496
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,200
Zhong Xueman's expression

497
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,400
was clearly nervous.

498
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,510
I noticed

499
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,610
she was about to draw her Bi'an Sword.

500
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,820
Of course I know something's off.

501
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,160
Then why didn't you

502
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,200
expose them just now, Young Master?

503
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,920
Their performance isn't over yet.

504
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,720
Exposing them now

505
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,720
would spoil the fun.

506
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,750
Might as well

507
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,000
let them continue

508
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,450
with their little show.

509
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,550
I've finally figured out

510
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,110
the key to the Yesha case.

511
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:13,940
Since the Secret Investigation Unit

512
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,340
took over the Yesha case,

513
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,160
we've actually

514
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,750
fallen into a misconception.

515
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,330
That is,

516
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,480
we've been following the case all along.

517
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,810
What's wrong with that?

518
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,110
For dealing with ordinary criminals,

519
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:24,920
that's fine.

520
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:26,590
But when dealing with Xiao Beiming,

521
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,920
it's a grave mistake.

522
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,030
I've been competing with Xiao Beiming
for years.

523
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,670
I believe my deductive abilities

524
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:32,680
are no worse than his,

525
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,790
yet I'm always one step behind,

526
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:34,920
half a beat too slow.

527
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,820
That's because there's one thing

528
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,110
I'm truly not as good at as he is.

529
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:39,750
What is it?

530
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,480
This is a gamble to start with.

531
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,550
Wanna bet?

532
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,070
If you lose this time,

533
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,920
you'll be doomed.

534
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,500
You've known me for years.

535
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,210
Have you ever seen me lose?

536
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,700
Do you know why you've never

537
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,700
been able to beat me all these years?

538
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,510
I'm not as willing to take risks as he is.

539
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,490
We thought

540
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,110
he would hide from us

541
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:02,750
like a mouse from a cat.

542
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,480
But in reality, this gambler

543
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,700
has never considered himself

544
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,550
as the mouse.

545
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:08,310
Instead, he sees himself as the hunter.

546
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,920
We thought we were hunting him,

547
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,830
but in reality,

548
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:11,680
we've been led

549
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,750
by the nose all along.

550
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,070
This is why we've always

551
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,310
failed to catch him.

552
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,920
Are you suggesting

553
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,750
he's been around us all this time?

554
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,270
If he wants to keep leading us on,

555
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,110
then I'll

556
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:26,440
follow the rope right to him
and catch him.

557
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,480
If well played,

558
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,200
it's going to be

559
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,550
a show that will shock the world.

560
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:40,550
Xueman.

561
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,030
I've always been curious about something.

562
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,350
Why do you dislike

563
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,510
Mr. Zhuge so much?

564
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,510
After all,

565
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,720
he's as renowned as Beiming,

566
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,790
both elite investigators of Qi Kingdom.

567
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,680
Is it just because of the rivalry

568
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,030
between the Elite Constabulary Unit
and the Secret Investigation Unit?

569
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:53,790
But you don't seem like

570
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,480
someone who would care about such things.

571
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,550
I just resent him.

572
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,680
I've always found him annoying.

573
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,110
A grown man always dressing up

574
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,920
all flashy and showy.

575
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,830
Beiming.

576
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,400
If you hadn't stopped me from
beating him up,

577
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,240
I would've taught him a lesson long ago.

578
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,030
The three of us have known each other
since childhood.

579
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,440
I remember Xueman used to

580
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,160
beat Zhuge Kongyun up when we were little.

581
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,160
Why was that?

582
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,890
This Zhuge Kongyun

583
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,160
may be a bit eccentric,

584
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,920
but he doesn't seem like a bad guy.

585
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,310
It's all just a facade.

586
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,680
He's been ruthless since childhood,

587
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,240
dabbling in all sorts of shady practices.

588
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,030
He's a wolf in sheep's clothing.

589
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:26,170
I remember a few years ago,

590
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,720
there was a serial murder case,

591
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,510
and to lure out the killer,

592
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,590
he used the victim as bait.

593
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,310
But that victim

594
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:33,790
was just

595
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,160
a teenage girl.

596
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,540
He did catch the killer in the end,

597
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,750
but that kid

598
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,550
developed hysteria from the trauma

599
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,750
and became a recluse.

600
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:44,750
Someone like him

601
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,030
only thinks about himself.

602
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:50,110
His methods of solving cases

603
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,720
have no moral boundaries, either.

604
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,590
You're too arrogant in handling cases.

605
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,420
I'm afraid you'll eventually

606
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,680
pay for your arrogance one day.

607
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,880
In life, one wrong step

608
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,590
often leads to many more.

609
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,160
I don't want you to go astray

610
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,220
and regret it in the future, you know?

611
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:05,000
You're too proud, even arrogant.

612
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,640
You think of Yesha as a rival

613
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,070
to play the game with,

614
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,240
but his real purpose

615
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,510
is not to defeat you.

616
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,510
You seem to get the upper hand now,

617
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,880
but how do you know

618
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,750
he has no backup plan?

619
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,880
And how do you know

620
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,750
whether he's deliberately

621
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,610
letting you gain this advantage?

622
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,820
We are the same kind of person.

623
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,180
You two are nothing alike.

624
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:26,030
I've made the same mistakes.

625
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,310
People like us

626
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,680
unconsciously put ourselves

627
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,960
in positions where we can control

628
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,420
others' lives and deaths.

629
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,170
But only by making mistakes

630
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,780
do we learn where to draw the line.

631
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,790
Zhuge Kongyun isn't inherently bad.

632
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,030
He just cares about things

633
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,400
that are different from what others value.

634
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,160
What he cares about

635
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,360
doesn't matter to me.

636
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,090
But about Huang Wuchang,

637
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:47,750
we can't let his off so easily.

638
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,390
Once we get back to the capital

639
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:52,730
and cure your illness,

640
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,800
I'll settle the score with him.

641
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,240
Tong Shuang.

642
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,440
Go faster.

643
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,400
Got it, Beiming.

644
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,310
Such a large forest,

645
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,880
yet not even a bird's call can be heard.

646
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,680
Indeed.

647
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,800
Watch out.

648
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,680
Keep an eye on Huang Wuchang.

649
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,160
Yes.

650
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,400
Danger! It's an ambush!

651
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,210
This smoke is poisonous...

652
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:08,640
Here.

653
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,510
Xueman.

654
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,790
You can't stay here.

655
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:12,630
The Elite Constabulary Unit
must already know

656
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:13,480
that Huang Wuchang and you

657
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,240
have returned to the capital.

658
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,590
If you don't go to
the Elite Constabulary Unit to report,

659
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:19,250
Fang Tianzheng will definitely
be suspicious.

660
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:21,920
They are all here

661
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,920
taking care of me.

662
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:23,880
Don't worry.

663
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,480
If you keep staying here

664
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,200
and Fang Tianzheng becomes suspicious,

665
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,400
things will get even more complicated.

666
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,080
Tong Shuang.

667
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,270
Go find out

668
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,790
if Old Bug has shown up recently.

669
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,160
This is the most urgent matter right now.

670
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,760
Alright, I'll go right away.

671
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,270
Coroner Feng, your injuries...

672
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,790
Don't worry, I'm okay.

673
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,480
I'll prepare some medicine
as soon as possible

674
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,750
to ease Beiming's pain

675
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,070
and buy as much time as we can.

676
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:53,920
Don't worry.

677
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,830
We'll take good care of Beiming.

678
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,070
Zhong Xueman.

679
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,880
I thought you had finally
made something of yourself,

680
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,760
that you could bring great merit
to the Elite Constabulary Unit,

681
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,440
so we could finally redeem our reputation.

682
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,500
But what happened?

683
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:14,510
The key criminal we went to such lengths
to capture

684
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:16,300
was snatched away by that sly fox
Zhuge Kongyun

685
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,830
right from under our noses.

686
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:18,790
If you had

687
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,640
sent me word earlier,

688
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:21,830
couldn't I have

689
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,050
negotiated with the Ministry of Justice?

690
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:26,310
Getting the proper documents
wouldn't have been difficult.

691
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,200
Chief.

692
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,590
It was my oversight.

693
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,610
A perfect opportunity for redemption

694
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,440
has fallen into

695
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,440
the Secret Investigation Unit's hands
just like that.

696
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,070
Huang Wuchang is connected to Yesha,

697
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,560
and he still has many secrets

698
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,270
that haven't been revealed.

699
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,000
Chief.

700
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,510
Could we request an audience
with His Majesty

701
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,590
to get him back from

702
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,750
the Secret Investigation Unit?

703
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,410
An audience with His Majesty?

704
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,790
On what grounds?

705
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,480
Huang Wuchang

706
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,010
was captured
by our Elite Constabulary Unit.

707
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,200
But wasn't Yesha Xiao Beiming also from

708
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,830
our Elite Constabulary Unit?

709
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:55,480
Xiao...

710
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,720
Regardless of whether Xiao Beiming
is Yesha or not,

711
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,240
as long as we can get Huang Wuchang,

712
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,020
make him talk,

713
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:05,880
and solve the Yesha case,

714
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,739
it would only benefit
our Elite Constabulary Unit.

715
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,280
Chief.

716
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,159
The Yesha case

717
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,590
concerns the reputation of
our Elite Constabulary Unit.

718
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,880
Please don't hesitate anymore.

719
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,190
I've confronted this man before.

720
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,280
He's completely insane,

721
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,630
and interrogating him won't be easy.

722
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,320
If he dies in the hands of
the Secret Investigation Unit,

723
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,630
we'll have no more leads
on the Yesha case.

724
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,190
Uncle!

725
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,110
Why are you calling me uncle?

726
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,230
How many times have I told you

727
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,800
not to call me uncle here?

728
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,920
News just came

729
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,750
that the key criminal from Weizhou

730
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,110
was abducted

731
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,840
while being escorted back to the capital.

732
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,280
You...

733
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,400
I'm incompetent

734
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,360
and failed to keep watch
over the key criminal.

735
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,110
His Majesty will summon us tomorrow.

736
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,920
How should we explain this to him?

737
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,139
If His Majesty flies into a rage,

738
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:59,000
I fear our deaths may soon follow!

739
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,310
It was my negligence.

740
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,920
I'll take full responsibility.

741
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,760
Now is not the time to be heroic.

742
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,160
Come up with a solution
as soon as possible.

743
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,290
[Sanli Teahouse]

744
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,740
Why have you come to see me?

745
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,400
Are you here to mock me

746
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,880
before I die,

747
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,880
or did your conscience suddenly kick in

748
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,410
and you want to say goodbye?

749
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,000
Say goodbye?

750
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,480
Don't pretend that you don't know.

751
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,320
My father and I

752
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,400
made a military pledge before His Majesty

753
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,920
to solve the Yesha case by the deadline.

754
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,310
Now, the case remains unsolved,

755
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:05,000
and Huang Wuchang has been abducted.

756
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,130
Tomorrow, His Majesty will summon us,

757
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,490
which will likely be our death sentence.

758
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,720
What exactly did you come to see me for?

759
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,320
There's only one way

760
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,680
to save you and your father.

761
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,800
What's that?

762
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,860
Recapture Huang Wuchang.

763
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,000
I can help you,

764
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,050
but you need to tell me

765
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:30,800
all the details about

766
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,070
Huang Wuchang's abduction.

767
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:34,530
Otherwise, I can't help you
even if I want to.

768
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,420
Even if I tell you

769
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,550
the inside story
of Huang Wuchang's abduction,

770
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,510
you won't be able

771
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,260
to catch him any time soon.

772
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,510
So telling you makes no difference.

773
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,540
That's not necessarily true.

774
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,610
You know something, don't you?

775
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,360
For Huang Wuchang to be abducted

776
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,230
from under the tight security of
your Secret Investigation Unit,

777
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,760
while everyone from your unit

778
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,440
remained completely unharmed,

779
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,070
there's only one possibility:

780
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,030
poison was used.

781
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,130
Someone did use poison.

782
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,480
What else do you know?

783
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,080
How was Huang Wuchang abducted?

784
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,070
I don't know the specifics,

785
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,550
but the people escorting Huang Wuchang

786
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,010
numbered at least a dozen,

787
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,710
all experts from
the Secret Investigation Unit,

788
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,440
with Zhuge Kongyun in command.

789
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,200
How could that person abduct him

790
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,710
without harming a single person

791
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,070
under those circumstances?

792
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,000
Unless it was...

793
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:22,800
Old Bug.

794
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,920
Xueman, but you need to

795
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,030
verify this information

796
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,150
with Zhuge Kongyun.

797
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,880
But Old Bug has seen you before.

798
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,280
If Zhuge Kongyun

799
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,630
learns this information

800
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,090
and finds him before we do,

801
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,010
your injuries will never heal,

802
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,880
and your whereabouts will be exposed.

803
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,150
Our top priority now

804
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,630
is to find Huang Wuchang.

805
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:41,190
Our strength alone isn't enough.

806
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:44,120
We need
the Secret Investigation Unit's resources.

807
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,230
Using Zhuge Kongyun's resources

808
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,710
to catch Old Bug,

809
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,630
while also trying to take Old Bug away

810
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,890
before he realizes it,

811
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,190
that's too risky.

812
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,750
Given the situation,

813
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,290
we have no other choice.

814
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,230
That person actually managed

815
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,800
to silently poison

816
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,660
your Secret Investigation Unit.

817
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,520
Whoever abducted him

818
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,190
must be a master of poison.

819
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,360
I happen to know

820
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,420
someone like that,

821
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,440
and he works for Yesha.

822
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:12,880
Who is it?

823
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,360
Old Bug, from Poison Valley.

824
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,320
Old Bug?

825
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,710
Someone released poisonous gas

826
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,110
into the air,

827
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,670
and by the time I realized,

828
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,000
it was already too late.

829
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,000
But how did Old Bug know?

830
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,590
The escort route was supposed to be
top secret.

831
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,390
That's right.

832
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,000
I suspect there's

833
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:45,880
a spy within
the Secret Investigation Unit.

834
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,480
I'm investigating,

835
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,070
but right now,
I don't have the slightest clue.

836
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,800
There must be a flaw somewhere.

837
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,150
I'll keep investigating.

838
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:51,980
Since I was able to

839
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,960
catch Huang Wuchang once,

840
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,110
I can certainly catch him a second time.

841
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,360
Waiter, bill please.

842
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:17,990
Zhong Xueman!

843
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,470
What's wrong?

844
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,480
Beiming is gone.
