00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,520
I'm not afraid of anything.

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,520
I'm not afraid of anything.

63
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,520
I'm not afraid of anything.

64
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,520
I'm not afraid of anything.

65
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,520
I'm not afraid of anything.

66
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,520
I'm not afraid of anything.

67
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,520
I'm not afraid of anything.

68
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,520
I'm not afraid of anything.

69
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,520
I'm not afraid of anything.

70
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,520
I'm not afraid of anything.

71
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,520
I'm not afraid of anything.

72
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,520
I'm not afraid of anything.

73
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,520
I'm not afraid of anything.

74
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,520
I'm not afraid of anything.

75
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,520
I'm not afraid of anything.

76
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,520
I'm not afraid of anything.

77
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,520
I'm not afraid of anything.

78
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,520
I met a romantic self who is like a zombie.

79
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,520
I found my original self.

80
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,520
I believed in myself.

81
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,520
My heart is cool and my heart is flying.

82
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,520
I'll take your coolness and blood.

83
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,520
Welcome to watch the show.

84
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,520
Take this prescription to catch the medicine.

85
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,520
In less than half a month,

86
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,520
Yin Yang's body will definitely be better.

87
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,520
I don't know how to repay the kindness of Mr. Feng.

88
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,520
Miss Huo is too kind.

89
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,520
You don't have to be so polite.

90
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,520
Your relationship with Yin Yang is really moving.

91
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,520
It's my honor to be able to catch the medicine for you.

92
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,520
You talk.

93
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,520
I'll go out first.

94
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,520
How about it?

95
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,520
Did they confess?

96
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,520
They confessed to killing Xue Qing Shan.

97
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,520
But they didn't admit General Huo's death.

98
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,520
That woman has a relationship with Li Xiao.

99
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,520
If my father finds out,

100
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,520
there is only one dead end.

101
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,520
And he is also in charge of the folk medicine workshop.

102
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,520
He has the most convenient way to do things.

103
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,520
Miss Huo does know a lot.

104
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,520
But she didn't know everything.

105
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,520
In fact, General Huo knew about their relationship.

106
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,520
She also gave Mrs. Huo a divorce letter.

107
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,520
But before they left, General Huo died.

108
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,520
Divorce letter?

109
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,520
How could my father give a divorce letter?

110
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,520
Mrs. Huo confessed that General Huo didn't have the ability to give birth.

111
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,520
So...

112
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,520
General Huo did have a secret.

113
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,520
That's all after the birth of Rong Er.

114
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,520
Rong Er was indeed born by me and General Huo.

115
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,520
I see.

116
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,520
Mr. Zhong, I'm afraid you misunderstood.

117
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,520
We found out that General Huo's death

118
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,520
may have something to do with a change 23 years ago.

119
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,520
You said you just came to the mansion.

120
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,520
What did General Huo say?

121
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,520
The pharmacy is not the real thing.

122
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,520
Besides, there are many ways to drug.

123
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,520
What do you mean by that?

124
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,520
I heard that Mrs. Feng asked General Huo to do the folk medicine.

125
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,520
I don't know if there's any left in the tea.

126
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,520
You can't make a decision for them.

127
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,520
So you suspect me and my mother.

128
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,520
Miss Huo is a smart person.

129
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,520
She knows my identity.

130
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,520
You should understand that the investigation is to rule out all kinds of possibilities.

131
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,520
Besides, Miss Huo doesn't want to prove her innocence.

132
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,520
I understand.

133
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,520
Wait a minute.

134
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,520
I'll get it right now.

135
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,520
You don't trust me?

136
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,520
General never told me about the outside world.

137
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,520
I know nothing.

138
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,520
Even if I heard something,

139
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,520
it's been so long.

140
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,520
I've forgotten it.

141
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,520
Mrs. Feng, it's a big deal.

142
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,520
Not only General Huo,

143
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,520
but also all the people who are alive.

144
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,520
Especially Miss Huo.

145
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,520
If you remember anything, please let me know.

146
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,520
Okay.

147
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,520
I'm a little tired.

148
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,520
If there's nothing else,

149
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,520
please go back.

150
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,520
Okay. Take care.

151
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,520
The End

152
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,520
These are tea bags and tea bags for health tea.

153
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,520
You can use them for the autopsy.

154
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,520
Thank you.

155
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,520
Is there anything else?

156
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,520
No.

157
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,520
Sorry to bother you.

158
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,520
How's it going over there?

159
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,520
Mrs. Feng's reaction is not normal.

160
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,520
Our guess is probably right.

161
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,520
But she's been hiding it.

162
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,520
We didn't find anything.

163
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,520
There are things that can't be hidden.

164
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,520
Mrs. Feng, please take this back and check it.

165
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,520
I'll stay and keep an eye on Huo's mansion.

166
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,520
Okay.

167
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,520
The phoenix coronet said that

168
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,520
as long as you persist in taking it,

169
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,520
you'll be fine soon.

170
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,520
They didn't make it hard for you, right?

171
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,520
They're just asking about the travel policy.

172
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,520
Don't worry.

173
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,520
I'll take care of it.

174
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,520
Mother.

175
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,520
What's wrong?

176
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,520
Did Zhongwu make it hard for you?

177
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,520
No.

178
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,520
Rong'er.

179
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,520
Let's go for a walk.

180
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,520
Okay.

181
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,520
I'll take you to the yard.

182
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,520
No.

183
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,520
I want to take you away from this mansion

184
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,520
and leave the capital.

185
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,520
Mother, why are you thinking like that?

186
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,520
So many things have happened to Huo's mansion.

187
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,520
Everyone is watching us.

188
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,520
In this mansion,

189
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,520
there are children and children's play everywhere.

190
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,520
Although you're distracted,

191
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,520
you can't handle

192
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,520
those bad people.

193
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,520
I'm afraid you'll get hurt.

194
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,520
Why don't we go out and hide?

195
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,520
When the phoenix coronet is over,

196
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,520
we'll come back, okay?

197
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,520
Mother.

198
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,520
I know you're worried about me.

199
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,520
Don't worry.

200
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,520
I have a way.

201
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,520
We'll be fine.

202
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,520
I've checked it.

203
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,520
The ingredients in the tea bag

204
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,520
are exactly the same as the ones in the tea house.

205
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,520
It's good for the body to take it for a long time.

206
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,520
Most importantly,

207
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,520
there are no traces of poison.

208
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,520
The phoenix coronet is definitely innocent.

209
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,520
Rong Zhi is smart.

210
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,520
He won't give us the tea bag with problems.

211
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,520
Then you want me to check it?

212
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,520
Isn't it useless?

213
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,520
No.

214
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,520
Let you check the tea bag

215
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,520
so that you can have a reference.

216
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,520
What reference?

217
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,520
Brother.

218
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,520
I found what you asked me to find.

219
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,520
This is...

220
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,520
When I checked General Huo's study,

221
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,520
I found that the location of the flowers

222
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,520
in the tea house

223
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,520
is not the same as other plants.

224
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,520
More importantly,

225
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,520
the flowers have withered this season.

226
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,520
Only he has such a good eye.

227
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,520
So I asked Tong Shuang to help me.

228
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,520
So-called check the tea bag

229
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,520
is to stall Huo Dalong

230
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,520
to give Tong Shuang time?

231
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,520
That's right.

232
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,520
Huo Dalong thought that

233
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,520
Mrs. Huo and Li Xiao were arrested.

234
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,520
The case is over.

235
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,520
He temporarily relaxed the police.

236
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,520
So when I told him about the health check,

237
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,520
he was not surprised.

238
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,520
Apparently, he was prepared.

239
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,520
Prepared?

240
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,520
Huo Dalong not only

241
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,520
checked the tea bag earlier,

242
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,520
but also

243
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,520
took me to General Huo's study.

244
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,520
I found that General Huo's tea

245
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,520
was replaced with new ones.

246
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,520
So he did not show any flaws

247
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,520
on the health check.

248
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,520
But there is always a mistake.

249
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,520
Look here.

250
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,520
There are tea leaves in it.

251
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,520
The tea leaves and the fallen leaves

252
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,520
are mixed in the mud.

253
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,520
It's hard to be found.

254
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,520
I guess General Huo

255
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,520
put the last tea

256
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,520
into the flower pot.

257
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,520
The tea plant was poisoned

258
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,520
by the tea leaves.

259
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,520
The flower was damaged.

260
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,520
The water was watered.

261
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,520
There was a problem.

262
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,520
I see.

263
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,520
Miss Huo

264
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,520
did not know that

265
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,520
General Huo had this habit.

266
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,520
Instead, she put all her thoughts

267
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,520
on the tea table.

268
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,520
She neglected the flower pot.

269
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,520
Smart.

270
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,520
How about it?

271
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,520
Is there a way?

272
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,520
Let me think about it.

273
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,320
My information is duplicate for now.

274
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,320
Ok.

275
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,320
Do you need it?

276
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,520
Ok.

277
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,520
Thank you.

278
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,720
Thank you.

279
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,120
I will take a leave now.

280
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,320
Hello?

281
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:09,820
Sir.

282
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:20,560
Vice Chief You've bought blood for my military

283
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,160
I need to talk to you for a moment

284
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,280
It's afraid

285
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,320
you don't see me for a long time.

286
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,760
I'll confront her when the ceremony is over.

287
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,680
This flower is not poisonous.

288
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,360
I can't think of a way to verify it.

289
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,160
You told me every day that you are poisonous.

290
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:38,800
What?

291
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,120
You can't even handle a pot of flowers?

292
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,680
Poisonous.

293
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,320
The Poisonous Flower

294
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,320
Miss Huo,

295
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,080
are you looking for her?

296
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,120
You are indeed Xiao Beiming.

297
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,720
You can't be too humble.

298
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,120
We found the poison in the same pot as in General Huo's body.

299
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,640
Wait, I haven't finished it.

300
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,120
What are you doing?

301
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,120
You are crazy.

302
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,360
Go and buy some sheep for me.

303
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:38,800
Sheep?

304
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,520
You want to eat sheep?

305
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,760
I want to live.

306
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,720
I've found the food in the cave.

307
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,320
Stop talking nonsense.

308
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:43,880
Go and buy it for me.

309
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,520
Do you hear me?

310
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,120
The Poisonous Flower

311
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,680
Although the blood crystal is new,

312
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,680
as long as you control the amount,

313
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,560
the taste and smell of the health tea

314
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,080
can be completely covered.

315
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,000
Feng Wu did a good job.

316
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,600
You killed General Huo.

317
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,600
That's right.

318
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,720
It's me.

319
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,880
But he is your father.

320
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,600
My father?

321
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,600
No father would treat his daughter like this.

322
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,280
Since I was a child,

323
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,600
I've always been like a thing that makes her angry.

324
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,600
Later, she married that woman

325
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,800
and let that woman bully us

326
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,200
and target us.

327
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,120
But she

328
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,680
pretended to be deaf and dumb

329
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,000
and listened to us.

330
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,760
Shouldn't I hate her?

331
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,320
Shouldn't I kill her?

332
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,680
Just because of hatred,

333
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,760
you poisoned General Huo's tea pot?

334
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,520
That's right.

335
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,240
That's right.

336
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,080
I know that poison is a hallucinating drug.

337
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,520
So I secretly added it to her health tea.

338
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,760
I thought

339
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,560
she would die slowly.

340
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,640
But I didn't expect

341
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,840
she would kill herself in the hallucination.

342
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,200
It's really a retribution.

343
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
For the drug,

344
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
you even used your own mother.

345
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,760
You killed her

346
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,160
and then you lied to that woman.

347
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,480
I'm the only lady in the Huo family.

348
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,800
By then,

349
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,040
my mother will have the best life.

350
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,600
It's worth it.

351
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,080
I can only do this.

352
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,280
Miss Huo,

353
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,000
it's best to tell the truth

354
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,240
now.

355
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,720
I killed her.

356
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,640
What I said just now is all true.

357
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,720
Nonsense.

358
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,880
Mother, you're not well.

359
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,880
You can't get out of bed.

360
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,720
Qingying, take her back.

361
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,120
Kneel down.

362
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,560
I...

363
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,120
Kneel down.

364
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,880
Mother, Rong'er was wrong.

365
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,400
I killed father.

366
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,560
Now they've found me.

367
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,480
The evidence is clear.

368
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,640
Rong'er can't escape.

369
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,600
Mother, I'm unfilial.

370
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,400
I can't let you live a long life.

371
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,440
You child.

372
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,840
You think you can hide

373
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,360
your little tricks from the adults?

374
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,440
Can you bear the punishment for me?

375
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,600
Mother, what are you talking about?

376
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,840
Father killed Rong'er.

377
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,040
It's none of your business.

378
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,360
Qingying, take her back.

379
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,640
Okay, let me ask you.

380
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,640
The medicine you can get is all forbidden.

381
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,920
Which pharmacy can sell it to you?

382
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,200
Where did you get these drugs?

383
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,080
Get up.

384
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,520
The one who deserves it will come sooner or later.

385
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,680
Mother, sit down.

386
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,240
My lords,

387
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,600
I came here to make things clear.

388
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,160
I killed General.

389
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,440
What's going on?

390
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,520
It's just an accident.

391
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,040
Half a year ago, General met Fan Xin.

392
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,640
She often asked me to go to the study with him.

393
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,800
Then I met a crippled doctor by accident.

394
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,360
He gave me a bottle of pill.

395
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,760
As long as the pill is ground into powder and put in the tea,

396
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,880
General will forget his worries

397
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,080
and will be kind to me.

398
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,560
I didn't believe it at first.

399
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,280
I just wanted to try it.

400
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,240
I didn't expect General to be so energetic

401
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,920
after drinking the tea.

402
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,160
Since then, General has asked me to

403
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,440
make tea for him every day.

404
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,720
It's getting better and better for me.

405
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,160
But then I gradually found

406
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,640
something wrong.

407
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:12,960
The drug?

408
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,120
Yes.

409
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,240
General's spirit was getting more and more excited.

410
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,400
But his temper

411
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,720
was getting more and more rough.

412
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,040
I tried to make tea for him.

413
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,560
General, that's all for today's tea.

414
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,840
But at that time, General

415
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,320
was like a crazy beast.

416
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,320
He was even more violent to me.

417
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,040
What about car accident?

418
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,080
General,

419
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,440
let's go have some tea.

420
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:40,600
Yes.

421
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,320
I had no choice.

422
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,680
I had to keep making him tea.

423
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,440
I thought

424
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,440
it's enough for me.

425
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,600
But I never thought

426
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,180
one day General would drink tea.

427
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,720
General, I'll help you to rest.

428
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,720
Li Kui, Li Kui.

429
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,720
I'm going to kill him.

430
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,720
General.

431
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,720
I'm going to kill him.

432
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,720
General.

433
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,720
I'm going to kill him.

434
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,720
General.

435
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,720
General.

436
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,720
Don't.

437
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,720
Save me.

438
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,720
Don't let him run away.

439
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,720
Don't let him run away.

440
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,720
He's here to avenge me.

441
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,720
General.

442
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,720
General, look at Rong'er's eyes.

443
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,720
I'll never forget.

444
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,720
I will never allow him to hurt my Rong'er.

445
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,720
So I decided to kill him.

446
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,720
But he didn't notice the difference.

447
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,720
Then I added more medicine.

448
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,720
General looked more and more crazy.

449
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,720
He looked at him with his eyes.

450
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,720
He killed himself.

451
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,720
Mother.

452
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,720
That's the way it is.

453
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,720
I'm the murderer.

454
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,720
I killed General.

455
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,720
Mother.

456
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,720
Even if you did it,

457
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,720
I can help you to live.

458
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,720
No need, Rong'er.

459
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,720
The Disappointment Department.

460
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,720
It's worth it to change one life for another.

461
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,720
You found out my identity that day.

462
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,720
You're willing to help me hide it.

463
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,720
Just to wait.

464
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,720
If I break this case one day,

465
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,720
you can use your aunt's life to change my life.

466
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,720
That's right.

467
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,720
You're the murderer of Daqi's wanted criminal.

468
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,720
As long as I hand you over to the secret police,

469
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,720
even if you're not a night killer,

470
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,720
your life won't be in your hands.

471
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,720
I'm willing to help you.

472
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,720
I'll help you.

473
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,720
I'll help you.

474
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,720
There are only two mothers left.

475
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,720
Ying Tai, 36 years.

476
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,720
Huo Dai Rong.

477
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,720
Young Master.

478
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,720
Let's go to Huo Mansion.

479
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,720
Before I came,

480
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,720
I already guessed your intentions.

481
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,720
I've thought about it.

482
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,720
I've also thought about it.

483
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,720
I think they're more concerned than me.

484
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,720
My life is very important.

485
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,720
But there are some things more important than my life.

486
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,720
If I make this deal with you today,

487
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,720
everything I've lived until now

488
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,720
will collapse.

489
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,720
Miss Huo, you once said

490
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,720
you know very well

491
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,720
what I did in the interrogation camp.

492
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,720
Then you should know

493
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,720
that I won't accept anyone's coercion.

494
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,720
I never did.

495
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,720
I still won't.

496
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,720
I'll do whatever you want.

497
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,720
Mother.

498
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,720
Don't make it difficult for us.

499
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,720
Mother.

500
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,720
Mother.

501
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,720
Mother, what's wrong?

502
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,720
I was going to

503
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,720
find you a good family

504
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,720
and watch you get married.

505
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,720
But now

506
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,720
I'm afraid

507
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,720
I can't.

508
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,720
Mother.

509
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,720
What do you mean by that?

510
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,720
I've been through a lot.

511
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,720
I've been through

512
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,720
a lot.

513
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,720
I've been a murderer.

514
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,720
I've been a good person.

515
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,720
Rong'er.

516
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,720
I can't bear to leave you.

517
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,720
Mother.

518
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,720
Mother.

519
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,720
Mother.

520
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,720
Little Saintess.

521
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,720
I know

522
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,720
you have doubts

523
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,720
about Rong'er's background.

524
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,720
Now I can tell you

525
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,720
that she

526
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,720
is not my biological daughter.

527
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,720
Twenty-three years ago,

528
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,720
the general took a baby back

529
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,720
from the border.

530
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,720
That was Rong'er.

531
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,720
I never told anyone about this.

532
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,720
Rong'er didn't know about it.

533
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,720
So

534
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,720
the things that Rong'er and you

535
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,720
are investigating

536
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,720
have nothing to do with it.

537
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,720
They have nothing to do with it.

538
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,720
Rong'er.

539
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,720
Your father

540
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,720
has been forcing you

541
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,720
and forcing you

542
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,720
because of your background.

543
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,720
Don't blame him.

544
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,720
I don't know

545
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,720
what happened in the past.

546
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,720
But now

547
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,720
everything is over.

548
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,720
I hope you

549
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,720
forget about it

550
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,720
and be a normal person.

551
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,720
I hope

552
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,720
I can be like you

553
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,720
and walk the road

554
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,720
without any regrets.

555
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,720
Mother.

556
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,720
Mother.

557
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,720
Mother.

558
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,720
Mother.

559
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,720
Yuanyuan.

560
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,720
I'm here.

561
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,720
Miss.

562
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,720
I beg you.

563
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,720
Take good care of me.

564
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,720
Take good care of me.

565
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,720
Yes.

566
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,720
I...

567
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,720
I...

568
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,720
Mother.

569
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,720
Madam.

570
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,720
Mother.

571
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,720
Mother.

572
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,720
Mother.

573
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,720
Madam.

574
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,720
Mother.

575
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,720
Mother.

576
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,720
Mother.

577
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,720
Mother.

578
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,720
Mother.

579
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,720
Mother.

580
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,720
Mother.

581
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,720
I'll go in and take a look.

582
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,720
Wait.

583
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,600
We only run two countries around the city

584
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,320
We can't let nobody pass

585
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:37,000
Your

586
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,000
What's going on

587
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,800
You are late

588
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,000
What to do next

589
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,320
I think it's not a big deal.

590
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,680
I just think that

591
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,840
although the case has been solved,

592
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,320
there seems to be no progress

593
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,480
between the case of Ye Shan and Haiya.

594
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,760
The more I investigate, the more I get confused.

595
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,560
What exactly happened to Haiya back then?

596
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,400
I always feel that there is something wrong with this case.

597
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,200
Something wrong?

598
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,200
You mean Aunt Feng?

599
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,520
The one in the testimony of Aunt Feng

600
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,480
is a bit strange.

601
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,800
Whether it's the timing of her appearance

602
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,200
or the motive she gave Aunt Feng to be shocked,

603
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,280
it's not normal.

604
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,960
But Aunt Feng is so determined to confess her crime and get poisoned.

605
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,760
It's because she's too determined,

606
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,880
so there's a problem.

607
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,880
I always feel that Aunt Feng is using her confidence

608
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,040
to cover up something.

609
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,720
You mean

610
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,800
the case hasn't ended yet?

611
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,680
But then,

612
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,800
who is the person

613
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,480
that she's worth using her life to cover up?

614
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,840
Huo Dai Rong.

615
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,520
It's not necessarily that every Haiya person is bad.

616
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,680
Then Huo Dai Rong is also bad.

617
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,160
Huo Dai Rong doesn't know her background.

618
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,400
She was also told by Aunt Feng before she died.

619
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,200
If Zhu Yitie doesn't confess,

620
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,160
we don't know that she's Haiya's orphan.

621
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,000
Anyway, I think

622
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,680
she's not a bad person.

623
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,920
Your Majesty, if they keep investigating,

624
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,000
they will be in big trouble.

625
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,720
Everything is in my plan.

626
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:12,920
But...

627
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,720
Do what you should do.

628
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,560
Yes.

629
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,720
She's definitely not the person behind it.

630
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,360
My Lady, the mid-term is coming.

631
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,240
Miss Huo, please accept my condolences.

632
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,280
I know you're not here to see me.

633
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,280
I'm here to see you.

634
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,120
I know you're not here to comfort me.

635
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,240
I just want to cry for Mother today.

636
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,120
But I realized that

637
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,520
the more I want to cry,

638
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,960
the more I can't.

639
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,320
I'm the only one who knows the pain in my heart.

640
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,120
I can understand how you feel.

641
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,440
But I…

642
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,080
But I…

643
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,520
That's all right.

644
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,880
We're just friends.

645
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,960
Very good, Miss Huo.

646
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,640
You can check again.

647
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,400
You have it now.

648
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,400
Miss Huo,

649
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,720
a lot of people has died already.

650
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,200
I will keep a secret for the Zanthoxyan Kingdom.

651
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,200
You have something to say, say it.

652
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,880
You can't hide anything in your heart.

653
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,280
But don't worry.

654
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,400
That thin-footed doctor,

655
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,360
I want to know who he is.

656
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,800
Who is he?

657
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,080
Brother Xiao!

658
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,360
Brother Xiao!

659
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,240
Brother Xiao!

660
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,520
Brother Xiao!

661
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,720
Brother Xiao, wake up!

662
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,400
Senior!

663
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,400
Brother Xiao!

664
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,240
Senior!

665
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,320
How is it?

666
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,840
The cold has returned.

667
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,200
I didn't expect it to come so soon.

668
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,600
I've given him the needle.

669
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,240
I guess he'll wake up later.

670
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,040
But this time, it's worse than last time.

671
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,600
I don't know when it comes again...

672
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,600
Get out of the way!

673
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,400
Tong Shuang!

674
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,240
Although the murderer of the Huo Fu case has committed suicide,

675
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,040
I still think this case is not that simple.

676
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,800
You still want to say that this case is related to Xiao Bei Ming?

677
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,280
Even if it's related,

678
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,880
there's only one clue in the thin-footed doctor.

679
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,920
With this clue,

680
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,040
where can we catch Xiao Bei Ming?

681
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,600
But I always feel that

682
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,800
Xiao Bei Ming is in the capital,

683
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,720
and even by our side.

684
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,280
Father, give me a few more days.

685
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,280
I will definitely catch him.

686
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,160
It's not that I don't give you time.

687
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,400
It's that we really don't have time.

688
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,520
With your intuition,

689
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,600
can you keep your head in the last few days?

690
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,600
All right.

691
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,160
I'll let Li Long investigate the matter of the thin-footed doctor.

692
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,320
You give us another way out.

693
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,720
Even if we die,

694
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,640
we can't die on a tree.

695
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,540
The

696
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,040
The

697
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:53,040
The

698
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,040
The

699
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,040
The

700
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,040
The

701
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,040
The

702
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,040
The

703
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,040
So,

704
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,280
the thin-footed doctor used the forbidden medicine

705
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,480
when he was unaware.

706
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,000
That's why this tragedy happened.

707
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,320
The

708
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,840
There must be something wrong with this doctor.

709
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,240
Besides the thin-footed doctor,

710
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,320
is there any other feature?

711
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,600
I heard from the thin-footed doctor that

712
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,360
he's a doctor who uses the forbidden medicine

713
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,640
to make a living.

714
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,920
Except for the thin-footed doctor,

715
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,920
no one has seen him.

716
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,920
The

717
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,920
The

718
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,920
The

719
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,920
The

720
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,920
The

721
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,920
The

722
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,920
How is it going?

723
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,920
Did you find a way to save Brother?

724
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,920
I've turned over all the medical books.

725
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,920
I didn't find a way.

726
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,920
But I have a new idea.

727
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,920
The method.

728
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,920
What time is it?

729
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,920
Can you stop talking?

730
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,920
It's too dangerous.

731
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,920
Let's discuss it again.

732
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,920
What do you mean?

733
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,920
I've seen the most poisonous cold poison.

734
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,920
It's not something that can be fought

735
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,920
by the common herbal medicine.

736
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,920
I want to poison it with poison.

737
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,920
Poison with poison?

738
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,920
According to the Yin-Yang Xiang Ke method,

739
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,920
the one that can control the coldness of the blood

740
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,920
must be the poison that can cure the coldness of the body,

741
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,920
and the poison that can cure the heat.

742
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,920
I can only think of one.

743
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,920
What is this fire silk?

744
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,920
I've never heard of it.

745
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,920
Fire silk is rare.

746
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,920
It's a herb that only grows in the mouth of the volcano.

747
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,920
The shape of its hair is like silk.

748
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,920
So it's called fire silk.

749
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,920
If it's a fire silk,

750
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,920
it may be effective in controlling the coldness of the blood.

751
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,920
Then try it.

752
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,920
I said that

753
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,920
the fire silk is rare.

754
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,920
It's not a common herb in the world.

755
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,920
Even if I can find it,

756
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,920
I can't guarantee that it will be effective.

757
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,920
If it doesn't work,

758
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,920
I'm afraid that Brother Xiao will die because of it.

759
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,920
It's more dangerous than this.

760
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,920
Whether it's dangerous or not,

761
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,920
finding the fire silk first

762
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,920
is better than doing nothing.

763
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,920
Where is the fire silk?

764
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,920
I'll find it right away.

765
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,920
My master's medical records

766
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,920
only show the fire silk.

767
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,920
I've only read about it in medical books.

768
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,920
Why do things here

769
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,920
all look so strange?

770
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,920
The ones that were stolen,

771
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,920
stolen,

772
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,920
killed,

773
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,920
and also dug

774
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,920
from the ancestors.

775
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,920
Of course it's strange.

776
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,920
The ghost city is indeed

777
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,920
a place of light.

778
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,920
It's a place of darkness.

779
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,920
I can't even imagine

780
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,920
what it's like.

781
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,920
It's so dark.

782
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,920
It's a place of light.

783
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,920
It's a place of darkness.

784
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,920
It's a place of darkness.

785
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,920
It's a place of darkness.

786
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,920
It's a place of darkness.

787
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,920
It's a place of darkness.

788
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,920
It's a place of darkness.

789
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,920
Hey.

790
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,920
Why do you think they're all looking at us?

791
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,920
They didn't get discovered, did they?

792
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,920
Maybe they can smell the smell of the living.

793
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,920
Ghosts are the rule.

794
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,920
Heroes don't ask about the origin.

795
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,920
Precious don't ask about the origin.

796
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,920
We have to be careful.

797
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,920
Don't get into trouble.

798
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,920
I understand.

799
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,920
The volcano is here.

800
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,920
That's the volcano.

801
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,920
Don't move.

802
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,920
How much is this thing?

803
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,920
How much can you pay?

804
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,920
I don't know.

805
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,920
I don't know.

806
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,920
I don't know.

807
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,920
I don't know.

808
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,920
I don't know.

809
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,920
I don't know.

810
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,920
I don't know.

811
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,920
I don't know.

812
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,920
I don't know.

813
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,920
How much can you pay?

814
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,920
50 taels.

815
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,920
Is that enough?

816
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,920
100 taels.

817
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,920
Isn't that enough?

818
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,920
The rule of my business is to exchange things for things.

819
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,920
What do you think is precious to you

820
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,920
that you can use to exchange things?

821
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,920
This is the heart of the money.

822
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:54,640
It can exchange money and the

823
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,920
This is the most precious thing on me.

824
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,920
Can I exchange it for your medicine?

825
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,920
Of course not.

826
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,920
What do you want?

827
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,920
Your eyes are very beautiful.

828
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,920
I don't know if I can use this thing to exchange your eyes.

829
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,920
Exchange it for you.

830
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,920
What's going on?

831
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,920
What's going on?

832
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,920
Find the thing.

833
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,920
Don't think about it.

834
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,920
You can't run away.

835
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,920
You are a good girl.

836
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,920
You are a good girl.

837
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,920
You are a good girl.

838
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,920
You are a good girl.

839
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,920
Hurry up.

840
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,920
Be careful.

841
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,920
Who are you?

842
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,920
Are you okay?

843
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,920
Don't chase after me.

844
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,920
Are you okay?

845
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,920
Don't chase after me.

846
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,920
I can't catch up.

847
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,920
What's wrong?

848
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,920
What's wrong with your eyes?

849
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,920
I can't see.

850
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,920
You can't see?

851
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,920
I can't see.

852
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,920
