1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
The King of Shamят

2
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,260
The King of Sham gratuitously

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,380
Roommates

4
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,440
Come on.

5
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,480
Come down here.

6
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,100
Shut up.

7
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,120
Just listen to me.

8
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,660
Bring them here.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Hurry up.

10
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Go.

11
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Hurry up.

12
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Go inside.

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You, follow her.

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Hurry up.

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Go inside.

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Hurry up.

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Hurry up.

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Go.

19
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You bitch.

20
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Go.

21
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Go.

22
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Someone is following us.

23
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Don't go back.

24
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Go.

25
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Okay.

26
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
We're going to the other side.

27
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Hurry up.

28
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Where is he?

29
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
He went to that side.

30
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Qi Guang.

31
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Qi Guang.

32
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What are you doing?

33
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
What's the point of being a man?

34
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I just picked it up.

35
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What's wrong?

36
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
They must be in the crowd.

37
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Sir.

38
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Should we block this place?

39
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
This is the place of the South.

40
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
How to block it?

41
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's okay.

42
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I have my own way.

43
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
This medicine is harmless to the body.

45
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It only takes two hours.

46
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You can wake up.

47
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Ren Ren.

48
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Come.

49
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Zhu Guai Kong Yun found you.

50
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
He should be not sure of my existence.

51
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
He was afraid of waking up the snake.

52
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So he has been secretly following and monitoring.

53
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Fortunately, I lost Dou Li in advance.

54
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'll find him after this case is over.

55
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Check the case first.

56
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Thank you.

57
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The case is over.

58
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Let's go.

59
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Let's go.

60
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Let's go.

61
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Let's go.

62
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Let's go.

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Let's go.

64
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Let's go.

65
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Let's go.

66
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Let's go.

67
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Let's go.

68
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Let's go.

69
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Let's go.

70
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Let's go.

71
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Let's go.

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Let's go.

73
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Let's go.

74
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Let's go.

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Let's go.

76
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Let's go.

77
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Let's go.

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Let's go.

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Let's go.

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Let's go.

81
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Let's go.

82
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Let's go.

83
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Let's go.

84
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Let's go.

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Let's go.

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That scoundrel in the middle is San Lang.

87
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Orange point door.

88
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
state-run Marquis Jing, the disaster- bridging marquis.

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Barrier marquis?

90
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
After Nanupbeat was killed,

91
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,240
once a royal relative

92
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,000
with his family got a big THB.

93
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
He was 비 priced to someone to follow.

94
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
In order to protect people,

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,520
was chased by the army and pushed to the cliff.

96
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,880
He's still alive?

97
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,080
He survived,

98
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,640
but his legs were badly injured.

99
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,840
He was disabled.

100
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,920
His Majesty was kind.

101
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,040
After hearing this,

102
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,160
he not only took them in,

103
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,400
but also granted him a mansion and a title.

104
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,640
He also followed his advice

105
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,480
and gave him a piece of land.

106
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,360
He took in the South Vietnamese,

107
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,280
which was the South Vietnamese.

108
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,240
So His Lordship is a kind and righteous person.

109
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,440
Why do you believe in these?

110
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,960
The

111
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,960
The

112
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,960
The

113
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,960
The

114
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,240
The Goddess has appeared.

115
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,040
Follow me.

116
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,040
The

117
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,040
The

118
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,040
The

119
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,040
The

120
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,040
The

121
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,040
The

122
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,040
The

123
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,040
The

124
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,720
Shall we go save them?

125
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,200
Now Dong Shui will clean up the army.

126
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,880
Wait a bit.

127
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,240
Maybe we can find clues

128
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,840
about Feng Shi's case from them.

129
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,520
We'll see what happens.

130
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,080
The

131
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,680
Who

132
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,680
Who

133
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,680
Who

134
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,680
Who

135
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,680
Who

136
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,020
The

137
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,340
The

138
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,340
The

139
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,980
The

140
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,020
We won!

141
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,140
Mr. Xin!

142
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,640
We won!

143
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,780
Mr. Xin!

144
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:54,640
Wait here.

145
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,320
Send people away

146
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,440
Go

147
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,640
I don't know who you are.

148
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,400
We just met.

149
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,760
The Sada in full bloom.

150
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,400
Since you know it,

151
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,000
you still dare to be rude to me.

152
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,120
Be careful, I'll have Sheng Qingtian take you away.

153
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,400
Take us away?

154
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,760
Take a try?

155
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,600
Who are you?

156
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,200
What are you going to do?

157
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,560
The investigation of the Divine Gap Camp.

158
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,200
Where did you hide the Saintess in the altar?

159
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,400
Tell me the truth.

160
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,040
The Saintess was helped by Shang Qingtian.

161
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,960
She was taken to be a traitor.

162
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,680
No one is going to disappear.

163
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,960
It's obviously a trick you did.

164
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,040
Say it.

165
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,120
If you don't say it,

166
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,800
I'll send you to heaven right now.

167
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,720
This is the Miguang Stone Powder, right?

168
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,320
You used fireworks to attract people's attention.

169
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,240
Then you used the Miguang Stone Powder

170
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,080
to sprinkle the flames on the altar.

171
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,480
When the Miguang Stone Powder meets the flames,

172
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,800
it will emit a very bright light.

173
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,040
People will close their eyes under the light.

174
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,800
You used it to make those Saintess disappear.

175
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,920
It's easy to say.

176
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,920
Even if I can make everyone close their eyes,

177
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,840
how can I make five people disappear

178
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,240
in an instant?

179
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,160
It's simple.

180
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,600
The altar is empty.

181
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,160
It's empty.

182
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,240
As long as the light appears,

183
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,200
everyone will close their eyes.

184
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,120
You used the mechanism to open the altar

185
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,680
to make the Saintess fall into the altar.

186
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,800
In this way,

187
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,920
it also caused the Saintess to disappear

188
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,160
under the eyes of everyone.

189
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,880
You used this kind of

190
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,200
simple trick to make money.

191
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,320
Wu Ji Chi Tan,

192
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,600
who are you?

193
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,920
Don't try to frame me.

194
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,200
What's the interesting

195
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,840
thing behind

196
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,360
trying to frame you in?

197
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,520
We're from the Coneler's Camp

198
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,760
to come and save you guys.

199
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,520
Say it,

200
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,600
these ladies are your friends.

201
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,800
Where did you get the jade?

202
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,880
We're all from the South.

203
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,800
Some of them were sold by our families.

204
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,520
Some of them were robbed by Hua Man Tian.

205
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,000
You sent them here

206
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,240
to sell them to Hu Shisan?

207
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,240
Every time the ritual was completed,

208
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,960
I took them here

209
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,560
and gave them money and fire.

210
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,280
Where is Hu Shisan now?

211
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,600
I don't know.

212
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,800
Every time I sent them here,

213
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,880
he waited for me here.

214
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,480
It was strange this time.

215
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,840
He wasn't here.

216
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,520
It was you.

217
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,000
Do you have a record

218
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,840
of the names of the women you sold?

219
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,360
Yes, we do.

220
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,600
Hu Shisan has a record.

221
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,520
He's...

222
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,400
Be careful.

223
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:49,880
Hold on.

224
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,120
Be careful.

225
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,880
You're injured.

226
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,640
They're injured.

227
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,520
You can't catch up.

228
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,920
Let him go.

229
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,600
I'll go.

230
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,240
I'll go.

231
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,040
I'll go.

232
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,760
I'll go.

233
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,480
I'll go.

234
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,320
I'll go.

235
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,120
I'll go.

236
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,600
Why did you run away?

237
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,520
Hu Shisan admitted it just now.

238
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,000
He should be hiding in this room.

239
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,360
Zhong Muhui,

240
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,760
take the girls back to the camp

241
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,040
and tell them the secret.

242
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,040
Feng Wu Suo and I will look for clues here.

243
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,920
We'll meet in the cave later.

244
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,560
I think I should take them back first.

245
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,440
You can't go with me.

246
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,640
It'll be a trouble if they're robbed.

247
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,040
I'll go.

248
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,600
Watch him for me.

249
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,800
How could this happen

250
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,240
under the heaven's feet?

251
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,760
They're all witnesses.

252
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,000
It's a big deal.

253
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,240
I think we should

254
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,000
report this to Chief Fang.

255
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,440
Brother,

256
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,840
I have one more request.

257
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:08,920
Junior,

258
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,720
what else do we have to ask?

259
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,080
Just tell me.

260
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,640
They're refugees from the South.

261
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,680
They suffered a lot

262
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,160
after being caught.

263
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,960
After the confession,

264
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,880
please arrange it.

265
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,520
If there are any family members left,

266
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,040
please send them back.

267
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,000
If there's nowhere to go,

268
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,280
please find a way out for them.

269
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,640
Don't worry, Junior.

270
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,520
They're...

271
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,760
If I'm not wrong,

272
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,400
this is the etiquette of the South.

273
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,240
To thank you,

274
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,520
I'm praying for you.

275
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,840
I've searched everywhere.

276
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,280
I didn't find anything.

277
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,280
Is Sada lying to us?

278
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,080
Thank you.

279
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,280
For what?

280
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,760
If you didn't block that attack for me,

281
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,320
I'm afraid I'd die under that sword.

282
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,160
Of course, you saved me.

283
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,000
We're on the same boat now.

284
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,240
If you die,

285
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,280
it'll affect the investigation.

286
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,280
No, you...

287
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,520
Forget it.

288
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,720
I'll pay you back.

289
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,720
How do you want to pay me back?

290
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,640
I haven't decided yet.

291
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,040
I'll pay you back sooner or later.

292
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,720
I don't want to owe you anything.

293
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,280
Thank you, Little White Dragon.

294
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,280
No, I told you

295
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,200
not to call me by my name.

296
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,960
That's weird.

297
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,000
I found out that

298
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,000
you're getting more and more like a good person.

299
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,160
You're not really framed, are you?

300
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,600
You guess?

301
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,720
You're not really framed, are you?

302
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,120
You're not really framed, are you?

303
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,960
Huh?

304
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,960
You're a coroner,

305
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,840
but you're also a high-level constable.

306
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,800
You should learn from the high-level constable

307
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,960
and keep your suspicions to yourself.

308
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,360
Don't trust anyone.

309
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,920
What if everything I've done

310
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,320
is using you?

311
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,720
Using me?

312
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,720
I'm not as tired as you are.

313
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,160
I only know that you saved my life.

314
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,240
Even if you use me, it's worth it.

315
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Besides,

316
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,000
I don't think Zhong Bukui doesn't trust you that much.

317
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,160
What do you mean?

318
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,760
Look.

319
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,240
Just like what you said.

320
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,920
He suspects everything.

321
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,680
He's afraid that you'll run away

322
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,000
if you leave his sight and use the chain to lock you up.

323
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,920
But when he finds out

324
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,600
that you took the wrong medicine and fainted,

325
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,240
he'll be anxious.

326
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,680
He's not like someone who would kill his enemy.

327
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,080
Maybe he's just afraid that I'll die

328
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,520
and the case won't be investigated.

329
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,520
But it's like the body won't lie.

330
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,080
The soul of the living can't lie to itself.

331
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,600
If he really doesn't trust you,

332
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,520
he should do his best to find evidence

333
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,880
and lock you up in the prison.

334
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,000
Instead of being like now

335
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,360
and being accused of hiding a criminal,

336
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,680
like Hu Shisan or Sadar,

337
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,560
who wants to catch the life-saving straw,

338
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,920
and try his best to prove something.

339
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,000
What does he want to prove?

340
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,640
You know better than I do.

341
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,000
I have another question about Sadar.

342
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,720
I need you to help me develop a medicine.

343
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,960
OK.

344
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:57,440
Every location starts with a digo...

345
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,520
What are you doing here?

346
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,200
Well.

347
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,360
I've been waiting for you.

348
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,320
What do you want?

349
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,680
I'm here to find someone.

350
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,200
Who will he be?

351
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,720
Even now,

352
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,680
You're not the Dark Battalion.

353
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,520
You can't be so reckless.

354
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,640
Do you know what the crime is?

355
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,960
I never thought

356
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,960
you would hide it by your side.

357
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,720
What are you talking about?

358
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,200
Come out.

359
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,200
Do you want to see me die here?

360
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,720
No.

361
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,320
Long time no see.

362
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,120
It's been three years.

363
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,760
I won again.

364
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,940
The

365
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,560
You...

366
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,720
Who are you?

367
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,840
I want to ask you who you are.

368
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,120
You stole my hat.

369
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,040
You don't have one at home, do you?

370
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,040
You...

371
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,320
This is the new subordinate of the Divine Trial.

372
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,080
This is the son of the Chief of the Dark Battalion,

373
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,680
the first Divine Trial in the Qi State.

374
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,680
I just didn't expect you to be so interested in his hat.

375
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,280
You're talking to me, aren't you?

376
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,880
What's going on with the blood on the ground?

377
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,080
Could it be that there's a death here?

378
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,080
You'd better explain it to me.

379
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,680
Mr. Zhuge has good eyes.

380
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,080
This is deep blood.

381
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,080
Recently, I've developed a new drug

382
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,680
that can help you keep your voice down.

383
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,080
But it needs a lot of deep blood

384
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,080
to make it so stinky.

385
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,480
Only the subordinate allows me to practice.

386
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,880
You think I'll be able to do it?

387
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,480
It's obviously a human blood.

388
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,280
What are you doing?

389
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,680
Sir.

390
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,280
Are you okay, sir?

391
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,280
Mr. Zhuge has good eyes.

392
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,280
It's human blood.

393
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,080
But it's the blood of a subordinate.

394
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,680
The subordinate was not feeling well a few days ago.

395
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,680
So I gave him this drug to get rid of some lung blood.

396
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,480
It seems that your body is not doing well.

397
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,880
You're not doing well.

398
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,080
It seems that your body is not doing well.

399
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,480
Feng, you should give him more.

400
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,280
This time, I'm just teaching you a lesson.

401
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,080
If you break into my house again,

402
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,480
it's not just a simple blood spout.

403
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,480
Slowly.

404
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,880
Be careful.

405
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,480
This person is so naughty.

406
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,480
He wears a red dress in the middle of the night and acts like a ghost.

407
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,880
He's really a bad guy.

408
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,280
He's just acting like a ghost.

409
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,280
Where's Xiao Bei Ming?

410
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,280
Come in.

411
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:46,980
Speaking of ghosts.

412
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,760
Don't ask about tomorrow

413
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,240
One is hurt, one is wrong

414
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,760
Don't look back, don't kneel

415
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:09,800
Break through the sky, why fear the ten thousand sword

416
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,760
No regrets, no grudges

417
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,840
Love and hate are only thoughts

418
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:22,960
If weSet a limit, a sacrifice

419
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:32,960
Both for immortal, but also for permanent

420
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,800
For what I seek

421
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,160
Even enchant to reach the end

422
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,040
Even risk my life

423
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:15,260
Mo 이건 su al

424
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,420
What brings you here?

425
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,280
After that incident,

426
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,200
it became a hamlet.

427
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,300
No longer open.

428
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,820
Then the boss played the陷阱

429
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,400
The attic was sold out.

430
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,000
I asked Tong Shuang to buy it.

431
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,160
I sealed the door

432
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,600
and made a secret passage to get in and out.

433
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,080
I'm afraid there's no place

434
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,240
safer than here in the whole capital.

435
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,840
Look at this first.

436
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,520
This is the picture book

437
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,520
found in Hu Shisan's house.

438
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:18,140
southwest area,

439
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,080
where the saints were buried,

440
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,000
on the list of When Moore were buried,

441
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,280
which mill or beverage shop were buried choose from?

442
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,840
Bastard,

443
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,960
This bloody black heart money

444
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,000
was exchanged with many women's blood and tears.

445
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,400
Look at that last page.

446
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,000
Only this little talisman doesn't show where it is.

447
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,520
Five people in total.

448
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,920
Four women were sold by Hu Shisan.

449
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,840
Then they were counted back.

450
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,240
Then all four women were sealed.

451
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,080
Only the little talisman was not sold.

452
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:44,920
This little talisman

453
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,400
is likely to be the key clue

454
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,240
to our breaking the seal.

455
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,560
That little talisman is just a picture.

456
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,120
There is no picture.

457
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,800
Where can we find it?

458
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,920
There is a place.

459
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,160
Hey.

460
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,600
Sirs.

461
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,720
Are you taking me to...

462
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,520
Madam Gu, why are you here?

463
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,680
I've been locked up here.

464
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,760
Why don't you let me go?

465
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,800
Madam Gu, I was wrong.

466
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,840
Please forgive me this time.

467
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,480
Do you know a woman named Xiao Fu?

468
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,840
No.

469
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:18,720
I've never heard of her.

470
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,480
Two months ago,

471
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,080
she was taken to your boss Hu Shisan.

472
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,560
Five women in total.

473
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,160
But only four were sold.

474
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,440
The rest is called Xiao Fu.

475
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,760
Do you remember her now?

476
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,560
Boss said

477
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,920
he would catch her back.

478
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,040
Otherwise,

479
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,440
we can't protect anyone

480
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,640
on the wall.

481
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,640
I remember it now.

482
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,000
One of them ran away.

483
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,320
I took someone to chase her.

484
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,760
Where did she go after she was caught?

485
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,960
She left it to our boss.

486
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,800
As for how our boss handled it,

487
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,120
I don't know.

488
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:45,920
Are you sure

489
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,640
there is no Xiao Fu among those women?

490
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,240
No.

491
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,520
We all took them to the brothel

492
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,680
to make them ourselves.

493
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,400
There is no Xiao Fu.

494
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,920
Every time the priest

495
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,360
will be five women.

496
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,000
If the previous Feng Shi'an

497
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,160
died a few women,

498
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,560
and the rest were the victims

499
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,560
of the crime two months ago,

500
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,120
then the rest

501
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,920
could be the next target of the tyrant.

502
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,120
The tyrant used the Four Deadly Faction

503
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,320
and the Red Cloth Group to kill the dead.

504
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,760
If he wants to kill five people,

505
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,280
the Four Deadly Faction can't make it.

506
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,280
Whether it's the case or not,

507
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,080
we need to figure out the identity of that woman.

508
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,080
Maybe there is a clue to Hu Shisan.

509
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,840
Tell me the address

510
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,560
of the men who chased you to Xiao Fu.

511
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,120
The criminal said

512
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,280
it's this place.

513
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,600
The house is so clean.

514
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,040
Someone must have lived here.

515
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,840
There is a backyard.

516
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,440
She is dead.

517
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,200
He is...

518
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,200
Luckily, there's a real tree of Feng Wu.

519
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,160
It feels much better.

520
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,240
I think he's cold.

521
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,480
He doesn't dare to hurt me.

522
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,400
You found Xiao Fu?

523
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,400
He's dead.

524
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,920
This should be a new grave.

525
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:28,880
That's weird.

526
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,160
Who would build a grave in the backyard of his house?

527
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,280
I don't know.

528
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,800
Hu Shisan was killed too?

529
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,480
Yes.

530
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,800
The body was sent to Shen Buying.

531
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,800
The suspect confirmed that it was Hu Shisan.

532
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,440
But not four people were killed.

533
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,480
Five people.

534
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,800
Where's Xiao Fu?

535
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,480
How did you know he was dead?

536
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,520
That grave.

537
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,280
Furonghua was buried in the grave.

538
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,520
There's no Furong in Nan Yue.

539
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,160
But he's called Xiao Fu.

540
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,280
Furonghua must have a special meaning for him.

541
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,400
So I guess

542
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,880
Furonghua is Xiao Fu's tomb.

543
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,760
Did you open the grave?

544
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,000
There's a female corpse in the grave.

545
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,400
She died at least two months ago.

546
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,840
The corpse hasn't fully recovered.

547
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,080
The suspect confirmed that

548
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,600
the female corpse is Xiao Fu.

549
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,520
There's a mark of being beaten on the corpse.

550
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,080
The skull was broken.

551
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,520
She died of a sudden shock.

552
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,320
The coroner found

553
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,120
the deceased was pregnant.

554
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,080
This is the clothes he didn't finish.

555
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,600
What did the coroner say?

556
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,640
Two months ago,

557
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,560
five saint girls were sent to Hu Shisan's family after the ceremony.

558
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,400
Xiao Fu once escaped.

559
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,760
How did he escape?

560
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,680
How did you catch him back?

561
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,280
He sneaked away.

562
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,600
We didn't know where to go at first.

563
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,960
But the other four people

564
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,280
told us where to go.

565
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,520
But the four saint girls

566
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,840
betrayed his whereabouts.

567
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,520
The suspect rushed to the door of the house

568
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,720
and caught him back.

569
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,520
No one knew what happened next.

570
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,280
I thought later

571
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,160
Hu Shisan was under the holy cross.

572
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,480
He beat Xiao Fu to death.

573
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,440
It's over.

574
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,720
The clue is broken again.

575
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,960
The person who killed Xiao Fu

576
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,920
was not only the four brothers and Hu Shisan,

577
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,160
but also the other people.

578
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,120
Sa Da.

579
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:11,960
Sa Da?

580
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,280
When we found him,

581
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,600
we should have caught him.

582
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,960
I know where he is.

583
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,840
Do you remember

584
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,200
what weapons the two men who took away Sa Da

585
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,400
used?

586
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:23,880
One is used for scissors.

587
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,880
One is used for arrows.

588
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:25,880
The moves are very strong.

589
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,880
The skills are profound.

590
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,040
It's not like the unknown.

591
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,800
The bridge still dieses too.

592
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,540
The two guards in the Mansion of primero Pai

593
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,600
is from the South.

594
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,400
Jin Shan Hou is also from the South.

595
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,160
The statute of idols is also on the bridge.

596
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,600
But he sent his two stars guards

597
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,800
to save Sa Da.

598
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,960
So the relationship

599
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,000
is not normal.

600
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,240
One of them was injured

601
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,280
in Uncle Jian Ling.

602
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,120
As long as you leather test them.

603
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,680
Eunuch Jin will find also

604
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,680
Sa Da,

605
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,800
as his identity ip.

606
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,560
A duke who is a king.

607
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:04,860
Where did he get the money to open such a

608
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,660
This Jingshan Monkey must have something to do with the flowers.

609
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,160
Did you ask about the condition in the house?

610
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,260
I heard about it.

611
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,160
There is a single son called A Jia in Jingshan Monkey.

612
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,860
Twenty heads but very mysterious

613
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,360
It is said that he never leaves the house

614
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,960
So few people see him

615
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,360
Single son, twenty heads

616
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,060
A personal guard to save

617
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,560
This A Jia is very cool

618
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,660
Is it a visit?

619
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,060
Make the thing bigger

620
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,360
What junior sister can find is just this

621
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,860
Come come

622
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,660
I'm starving

623
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:37,360
Isn't Zhong Qingman investigating Feng Shi'an?

624
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,360
Why is it full of flowers and the moon again?

625
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,160
What do you mean?

626
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,660
Chief, the brothers who just went to the street reported

627
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:46,560
Said to see the junior sister went to the direction of the Jingshan Monkey Mansion

628
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,760
Hurry up, prepare to have a big thing

629
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,760
Go go go

630
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,260
Go go go

631
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,460
The police station is handling the case

632
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,660
I want to see your marquis

633
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,960
Our prince is not at home

634
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,060
Please go back

635
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,260
Life is in the sky

636
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,660
Please inform

637
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,860
The prince is not at home

638
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,760
Find someone to inform

639
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,560
go

640
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,460
let's clearing

641
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,460
Bring me the mixture

642
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,060
IDs

643
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,560
Let's go

644
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,740
Stop

645
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,560
Follow me

646
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,060
How dare you trespass into the mansion of the Marquis of Jing Shan?

647
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,660
How dare you!

648
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,660
Don't you know what place this is?

649
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,180
You two are really despicable.

650
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,780
We just fought last night.

651
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,540
I don't know what you're talking about.

652
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,580
trespassing into the mansion of the Marquis is a capital crime.

653
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,180
You either give up on saving Qin,

654
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,500
or you'll die.

655
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,500
If you're capable,

656
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,220
you can come and get it.

657
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,740
Stop!

658
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,940
Zhu Xuan Man,

659
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,740
what are you doing?

660
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,340
Do you know where this is?

661
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,140
Of course I do.

662
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,060
You do?

663
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,700
You dare to come here when you know?

664
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,780
I'm just handling a case.

665
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,780
You're investigating the case of Hua Man Tian.

666
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:40,260
Even if Hua Man Tian is related to the South Vietnamese,

667
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,580
you have to know

668
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:44,580
that this place is a mansion of the Marquis.

669
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,500
Hua Man Tian is known for his temple.

670
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,580
When he was selling the South Vietnamese refugees,

671
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,020
the four victims of the Fengshan case

672
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,900
were all the holy women chosen by Hua Man Tian.

673
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,980
Among all the South Vietnamese,

674
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,340
only Jing Shan Hou is capable of this.

675
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,460
So I suspect that Hua Man Tian's head, Sa Da,

676
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,180
is hidden in the mansion of Jing Shan Hou.

677
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,740
You said that Hua Man Tian's head

678
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,980
is hidden in the mansion of Jing Shan Hou.

679
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,100
Do you have any evidence?

680
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,860
I caught Sa Da last night,

681
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,780
but he was saved by two men in black.

682
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,300
It's the two of them right now.

683
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,860
Is that true?

684
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,340
We are the personal guards of Jing Shan Hou.

685
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,820
We never leave the Marquis.

686
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,340
How could we save Sa Da?

687
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,580
Nonsense!

688
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,500
When you fought with me last night,

689
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,300
one of you was injured by my arm

690
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,420
in the arm.

691
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,020
We can check it out.

692
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,420
If there is no wound,

693
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,780
I will admit my crime.

694
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,820
If there is a wound,

695
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,740
it means that I'm not lying.

696
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:50,740
Please tell me where Sa Da is.

697
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,740
It's reasonable.

698
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,100
If there is no wound,

699
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,540
why don't you push for the evidence?

700
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,460
Do we need to

701
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,740
take action?

702
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,980
Wait!

703
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,740
Marquis.

704
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,540
Greetings, Marquis Jing Shan.

705
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:33,540
I'm very interested in what you said just now.

706
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,540
Like Hua Man Tian or Feng Shi An.

707
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,140
Although I don't understand,

708
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,740
since the Shen Buying

709
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,340
suspects that the people in our mansion

710
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,940
are related to the thieves,

711
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:48,140
I can't be outside the city.

712
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,740
Please don't blame me, Marquis.

713
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,340
It's all my fault.

714
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,940
It's all our fault.

715
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,340
It's okay.

716
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,940
Marquis Jing Shan

717
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,740
needs to be famous and honorable.

718
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:07,740
Since this woman wants to see the evidence,

719
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:10,740
you two can take the items

720
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,340
and let her see.

721
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,940
Yes.

722
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,940
You two are doing this

723
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,540
to cover up the evidence.

724
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,540
You're doing this on purpose.

725
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:29,540
We always play martial arts

726
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,540
to earn money.

727
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,540
It's inevitable that we get hurt in the game.

728
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,540
We can't get over the wounds

729
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,540
if we get hurt.

730
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,940
What do you think of

731
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,340
the way you play?

732
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,940
Marquis,

733
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,140
I think it's better to

734
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,540
let the people in our mansion

735
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,540
know about the truth.

736
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,940
I think it's better to

737
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,340
let the people in our mansion

738
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,540
know about the truth.

739
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,940
I think it's better to

740
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,340
let the people in our mansion

741
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,940
know about the truth.

742
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:54,940
Marquis,

743
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,940
the wounds on their bodies

744
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,940
are not evidence.

745
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,940
Wait.

746
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:06,940
What else

747
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,340
do you think of?

748
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,340
I want to search the mansion.

749
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,940
I don't want to cause you

750
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,140
any trouble because of a misunderstanding.

751
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,140
After all, people are important.

752
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,140
You care so much about your reputation.

753
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,740
If you're honest

754
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,940
and innocent,

755
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,540
why don't you let us search the mansion?

756
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,540
If there's any gossip,

757
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,940
we can prove your innocence

758
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,740
in the police station.

759
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,740
How dare you!

760
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,940
You can search the mansion

761
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:33,340
as you want.

762
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,940
Not to mention the police station.

763
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,740
If there's no imperial edict,

764
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,340
the Ministry of Justice and the Court of Judicial Review

765
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,740
will not be punished.

766
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,140
Zhong Xue Man,

767
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,140
get down.

768
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,740
Marquis,

769
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:47,540
since it's so,

770
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,940
I'll make it clear.

771
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,540
If it's just because of the flowers,

772
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,740
we won't dare to break into the mansion.

773
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,540
But it's a long story.

774
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,940
It might be related to the Night Fiend case three years ago.

775
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,340
The Night Fiend case is not a small matter to His Majesty.

776
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,140
If Marquis deliberately stopped

777
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,740
the criminals,

778
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,940
not to mention that Marquis is not a man of Qi,

779
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,940
even if he's a royal family member,

780
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:09,540
I'm afraid he can't stop His Majesty from getting angry.

781
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,940
Please think twice.

782
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,740
Report!

783
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,540
Marquis,

784
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,740
bad news!

785
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,740
Young Master, he...

786
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,540
What's the hurry?

787
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,540
I wonder if the police station

788
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,540
can help Marquis.

789
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,140
Did something happen to A-Jia?

790
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,140
Young Master is missing.

791
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,540
There's blood in the yard.

792
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,940
What?

793
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,140
What's going on?

794
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,140
What's going on?

795
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,140
What?

796
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,340
Yi Tian,

797
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,940
take someone to the backyard to investigate.

798
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,940
Yes, sir.

799
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,940
Hurry!

800
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,740
Who saw Young Master last?

801
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:11,940
It was me.

802
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,940
I saw him last last last night.

803
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,740
Young Master and a few maids

804
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,340
were having fun in the cold field.

805
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,540
They didn't let us in.

806
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,740
I asked a few maids to have breakfast this morning.

807
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,740
When we entered,

808
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,140
we saw blood all over the place.

809
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,140
Young Master is missing too.

810
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:24,940
You...

811
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:25,940
You're a piece of crap!

812
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,540
Didn't I tell you to keep an eye on him?

813
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,540
Go find him!

814
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,940
Yes, sir.

815
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,540
Marquis,

816
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,940
the criminals must have taken Young Master

817
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,540
after he was injured.

818
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,940
Now the Shen Buying is going to block

819
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,340
the whole Jingshan Marquis' mansion.

820
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,340
Let's see if we can find

821
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,540
any clues about Young Master's disappearance.

822
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,540
Okay.

823
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,740
I'll listen to you.

824
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:48,340
No matter what you do,

825
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,740
I hope you can save my son.

826
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,740
Don't worry, Marquis.

827
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,140
Block the Jingshan Marquis' mansion!

828
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,540
Yes, sir!

829
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,540
Search carefully.

830
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,340
Don't miss any corner.

831
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,740
Report to me if you find anything.

832
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,740
Yes, sir.

833
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,740
I've asked around.

834
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,940
Young Master likes to spend time here.

835
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,540
He also likes to play with the maids

836
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,140
and hide-and-seek.

837
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,740
Where's the woman in the wine room?

838
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,740
She's unconscious.

839
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,940
There's no other findings.

840
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:22,940
According to the blood,

841
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,540
A Jiah was taken away from here.

842
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:26,940
Not much blood.

843
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:27,940
She's not supposed to die.

844
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,340
I found something!

845
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,540
What?

846
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,940
I found this rough piece of cloth

847
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,540
on the Jingshan Jingshan's bed.

848
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,340
My initial guess

849
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,540
should be that the murderer

850
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,940
was caught by the sharp Jingshan Jingshan

851
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,940
when he was hunting Young Master A Jiah.

852
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,540
There's a smell of iron.

853
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,940
And a smell of salt.

854
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,940
So I guess

855
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,540
the place where the murderer often goes

856
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,740
should have a lot of salt and iron.

857
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,540
But ordinary people have salt and iron at home.

858
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,140
The Jingshan Jingshan is so low-class.

859
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:01,940
The rough piece of cloth

860
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:04,140
should have been hung from the murderer's pants.

861
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,140
Who would throw salt cans and iron

862
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,540
on the ground?

863
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,140
It's more like a warehouse with salt and iron.

864
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,340
The salt and iron in the Great Qi are all official.

865
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,340
To have a warehouse

866
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,740
with so much salt and iron

867
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,540
is the only place in the capital

868
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,140
that has salt and iron.

869
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,140
All of you, gather!

870
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,340
Salt and iron factory!

871
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:24,340
Let our men follow them.

872
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,340
Yes.

873
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,540
Go! Hurry!

874
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,540
Mr. Feng.

875
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:48,040
Cara Qun

876
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,340
I'm here to protect you

877
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,340
I'm here to protect you

878
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,340
I'm here to protect you

879
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,340
I'm here to protect you

880
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,340
I'm here to protect you

881
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,340
I'm here to protect you

882
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,340
I'm here to protect you

883
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,340
I'm here to protect you

884
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,340
I'm here to protect you

885
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,340
I'm here to protect you

886
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,340
I'm here to protect you

887
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:37,340
I'm here to protect you

888
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,340
I'm here to protect you

889
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:41,340
I'm here to protect you
