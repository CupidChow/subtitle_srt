00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,150
where Yellow Heaven conducts
their Heaven's Roar ritual

84
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,510

But how do we investigate this?

88
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,270
The Heaven's Roar ritual requires
blood from living humans.

Something this inhumane

90
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,460
will certainly be conducted
in secret by Yellow Heaven.

91
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,270
This might be even harder to investigate

92
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,670
than their corpse refinement operations.

That's right.

103

You can't hide the truth forever.

104
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,390
If Yellow Heaven
is harvesting human blood,

105
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,580

Yellow Heaven's blood harvesting

112
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,510

You should start from that angle.

00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,830
Miss Huo is quite clever.

115
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,900
The two of you working together

116
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,340

I know Weizhou better than anyone.

122

00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:58,830
Exactly.

125
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,660
It's precisely because
you know Weizhou so well

126
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,070
that we can't let you go.

127
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,660
You're a constable.

128
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,070
You should understand that investigating

129
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,270
requires secrecy.

130
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,710

00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,840
our task will become even more difficult.

135
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,610

more difficult for you?

During the interrogation,

158
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,390
you lost your temper and attacked them.

Still thinking about Tong Shuang?

200
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,390
Tong Shuang is from Weizhou.

201
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,350
And now we're staying
at the Pingyuan Escort Agency,

202
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,950
where everything around him

203
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,300
reminds him of the past.

204
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,870
Dozens of people

205
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,110
died in a single night.

206
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,560
No one can remain unmoved by that,

207
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,990
or feel nothing at all.

208
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,780
Fire! Fire!

209
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,700
Help!

210
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,020
Quick! We need water!

211
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:17,990
Fire!

212
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,270
More water!

213
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,290
Help!

214
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,820
So it's normal that he lost control

215
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,390
and made some mistakes.

216
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,520
The way you spoke to him this morning

217
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,450
probably made him feel even worse.

218
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,350
I understand him.

219
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,660
But for what we're doing now,

220
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,540
we can't tolerate
even the slightest mistake.

221
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,270
Yes, we need to avoid mistakes,

222
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,870
but is keeping him out of the plan

223
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,330
really the best solution?

224
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,710
Telling him to calm down

225
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,390
doesn't mean he can.

226
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,160
I especially understand

227
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,960
how Tong Shuang feels right now.

228
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,300
Because

229
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,300
I've been through it too.

230
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:04,820
Xueman.

231
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,640
After the Fengbo Lake tragedy,

232
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,060
I tried countless times

233
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,660
to bury my hatred for you

234
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,420
and be a normal person.

235
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:16,700
But the truth is that

236
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,890
anger doesn't just disappear.

237
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,990
It only makes the pain worse.

238
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,510
Sometimes, letting out

239
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,780
those bottled-up emotions

240
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,900
might be better.

241
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,240
Go check on him.

242
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,110
Leave the investigation to me.

243
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,070
I don't quite understand

244
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,670
the bond between you men.

245
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,400
But I know he needs you

246
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,110
more than I do right now.

247
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,570
Third Young Master, you must be hungry.

248
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:01,740
I'll go to the kitchen
and get you something to eat.

249
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:06,790
Young Master Tong!

250
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,580
Why are they here again?

251
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,770
-Young Master Tong!
-Young Master Tong!

252
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:11,820
Young Master!

253
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,100
What are you doing?

254
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,650
Slow down!

255
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,910
-Young Master Tong!
-Young Master Tong!

256
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:16,950
Go away!

257
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:18,370
Young Master, I...

258
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,540
I told you all to go away!

259
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,300
Quickly leave.

260
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,380
Young Master,

261
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:24,540
they...

262
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,870
Mr. Hai, close the door.

263
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,340
Stop right there!

264
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,300
What is this?

265
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,160
Young Master Tong,

266
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,420
I don't have anything valuable at home.

267
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,020
I just have some millet left.

268
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,650
We've come to apologize.

269
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,890
The officials told us

270
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,410
about the grave robbers.

271
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,490
We've come to

272
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:48,690
offer our apologies.

273
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,820
Yes, Young Master Tong.

274
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,850
Before the tragedy of
Pingyuan Escort Agency,

275
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:53,850
the poor people of Weizhou,

276
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,460
those with family hardships,

277
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,660
all received help from the Tong family.

278
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,460
Back when we couldn't afford to eat,

279
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,310
it was Old Master Tong

280
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,580
who gave our family a bag of rice,

281
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,980
saving my entire family.

282
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,050
We were cowards

283
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,220
and ungrateful.

284
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,130
Young Master Tong,

285
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,340
please accept these gifts

286
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,700
to ease our conscience.

287
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,010
Yes, Young Master Tong.

288
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:11,870
These items

289
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,470
may not be worth much,

290
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,180
but they represent

291
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,170
our sincere gratitude.

292
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,220
Please don't refuse them.

293
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:17,700
Yes.

294
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,630
Please accept them, Young Master.

295
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:20,700
Yes, Young Master Tong.

296
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,850
Please accept them.

297
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:23,540
Take them, Young Master Tong.

298
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,740
Please accept them, Young Master Tong.

299
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,320
-Accept it.
-Third Young Master.

300
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,850
Please accept these gifts.

301
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,580
If Master sees this from heaven,

302
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,010
he'll be comforted.

303
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:00,940
Thank you.

304
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:06,820
You may go now.

305
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,100
Go on, leave.

306
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:20,870
[Pingyuan Escort Agency]

307
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,180
Sir,

308
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,610
we'd like to buy some medicinal herbs.

309
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,470
Yes, of course.

310
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,550
Please have a seat.

311
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,370
What kind of medicine do you need?

312
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,440
We'd like to buy some

313
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,570
medicine to nourish blood and energy.

314
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,630
Nourishing medicine?

315
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,300
Anything like ginseng
and codonopsis would do.

316
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,180
We've just been

317
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,340
to several pharmacies,

318
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,940
but they're all out of stock.

319
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,580
I don't have any either.

320
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,010
I'm afraid there's none left
in all of Weizhou City.

321
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,010
How can that be?

322
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,520
Surely not everyone

323
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,850
in the city needs to nourish their blood?

324
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:03,970
Just know they aren't available.

325
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,420
Don't ask about anything else.

326
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,010
I won't tell you even if you ask.

327
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,010
Suit yourselves.

328
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,060
Darling!

329
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:32,970
What's wrong?

330
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,220
Darling,

331
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,300
are you alright?

332
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,460
Darling.

333
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,890
Why is there so much blood?

334
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,590
Sir,

335
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,740
my husband is severely injured.

336
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,180
He's lost a lot of blood.

337
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,070
If I can't find

338
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,220
medicine to replenish his blood,

339
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,540
he won't survive.

340
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:50,940
I'm begging you,

341
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:53,300
please show some compassion as a healer.

342
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,370
Darling.

343
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,540
-Darling, don't scare me.
-Okay, okay.

344
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,250
I can tell you

345
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,700
where to get blood-nourishing medicine.

346
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,730
Take him away quickly.

347
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:01,770
if he dies here,

348
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,280
it'll ruin my reputation.

349
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,390
Thank you, sir.

350
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,650
No rush. Eat slowly.

351
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,540
You've reached the Qi Kingdom territory

352
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,610
and you're safe now.

353
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,540
I have urgent matters

354
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,060
and can't escort you any further.

355
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:48,650
Just ahead,

356
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,820
there are Qi Kingdom soldiers patrolling.

357
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,650
Later, hurry back

358
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,370
to find your family.

359
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,490
Thank you.

360
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,480
Aren't you going to find your family?

361
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,829
Are we heading the same way?

362
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,260
No.

363
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,000
Then why are you following me?

364
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,020
I want to repay your kindness.

365
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,060
I don't need your gratitude.

366
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,020
Hurry into town

367
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,260
and find someone to treat your leg.

368
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,500
Otherwise, you'll have a limp.

369
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,650
I want to follow you.

370
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,100
Waiter!

371
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,650
Bring him water and a bowl of noodles.

372
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:11,370
Right away!

373
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,030
What about your noodles?

374
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,480
Why is it you again?

375
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,480
I want to follow you.

376
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:57,950
Young man,

377
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,480
I can see
you have some martial arts skills

378
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,680
and determination.

379
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:02,930
Why not do something

380
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,330

00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:54,890
to the poison in Xiao Beiming at all.

570
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,210
Go look at his arm.

571
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,540
There must be

572
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,850
a bruised blood mark.

573
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,340
Because that's the sign

574
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,450
the poison has already entered

575
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:02,980
his meridians.

576
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:03,980
I'm just a constable

577
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,580
seeking the truth.

578
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,020
Even if I die,

579
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,300
I'll die on the path of justice.

580
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:10,980
Say something.

581
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,020
Beiming.

582
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:19,670
Don't give Feng Qingzhuo a hard time.

583
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,450
This was my own choice.

584
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:25,980
Beiming,

585
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,370
what's going on?

586
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,450
Why did you hide

587
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:54,820
something so serious from us?

588
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,690
[Escort]

589
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:57,850
Speak!

590
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,450
Beiming told me

591
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:00,740
not to tell you all.

592
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:02,020
Why?

593
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,540
He was afraid that if you knew,

594
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,470
you wouldn't focus on the investigation

595
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,200
and would only worry about him.

596
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,170
Not only would that not save his life,

597
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,610
but would also delay the investigation.

598
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:13,020
What we're doing now

599
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,580
is far more important
than the remaining days

600
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,500
of my life.

601
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,940
Even at a time like this,

602
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,620
he's still thinking about
the investigation.

603
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:22,800
He said before

604
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:26,250
that to die on the path of justice

605
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,410
is his destiny.

606
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:38,990
[Escort]

607
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:35,410
Tong Shuang!

608
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:36,580
Tong Shuang, where are you going?

609
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,340
To find Old Bug.

610
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:37,930
What for?

611
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,370
He knows how to cure the poison.

612
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:40,130
Stop being ridiculous.

613
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,300
You stop it!

614
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,210
Beiming is already in this state.

615
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:45,610
He's running out of time.

616
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,020
I know you're worried.

617
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:48,900
I'm even more worried than you.

618
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:50,650
But can you find Old Bug now?

619
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:51,820
Will you make it in time?

620
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,610
Then tell me what to do!

621
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,060
Should we just stand by

622
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,410
and watch Beiming die?

623
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,610
Tong Shuang.

624
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,210
At a time like this,

625
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:03,820
don't make Beiming

626
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,220
worry about you anymore.

627
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,450
He treats you like his own brother.

628
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:08,380
Right now,

629
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,410
you should stay by his side.

630
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:16,950
How many days left?

631
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,450
The one-month deadline

632
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,690
is already half over.

633
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,980
-Xueman, I...
-I know.

634
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,070
I understand everything.

635
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,300
You are my senior,

636
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:39,210
but you're also a constable
of the Elite Constabulary Unit.

637
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:39,910
I know you have

638
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:41,510
things you must do.

639
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,680
Let's discuss the case first.

640
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:52,850
Everyone,

641
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,580
report what clues you've found.

642
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:57,820
Beiming, you're in this condition...

643
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,580
Coroner Feng and I

644
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,500
visited all the pharmacies

645
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,350
and clinics in Weizhou today.

646
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,260
Nothing seemed unusual,

647
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:17,130
except that all blood-nourishing tonics

648
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,340
are completely sold out.

649
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,520
I don't have any either.

650
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,930
I'm afraid there's none left
in all of Weizhou City.

651
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,020
It seems a mysterious wealthy merchant

652
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:23,950
bought them all.

653
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,250
Xueman,

654
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,170
what did you find out?

655
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:28,580
I spent the day
talking with

656
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,610
idlers at teahouses and customers

657
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:30,650
at Yangchun House.

658
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:31,650
From what I heard,

659
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:33,650
there's indeed something
strange recently.

660
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:35,580
Adopting sons to care for elderly parents.

661
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,610
A group of wealthy merchants

662
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:37,650
recently arrived in Weizhou.

663
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,850
They have no children,

664
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,610
but they want to adopt strong young men

665
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:41,260
who are filial

666
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,170
and whose parents have passed away.

667
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:44,690
These adopted sons
will serve their adoptive parents,

668
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:46,020
and when the adoptive parents pass away,

669
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,820
they will inherit their wealth.

670
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,580
I also found out they've recently

671
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,170
rented the Salt Business Guild

672
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:52,740
to recruit these adopted sons.

673
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,820
The selection criteria
are reportedly very strict.

674
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,820
Those with family

675
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:57,170
or living parents

676
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:58,540
are rejected outright.

677
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,260
So those coming to offer filial piety

678
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,260
are mostly ruffians and beggars.

679
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,100
Oh,

680
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,690
that merchant who bought all the tonics

681
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:08,090
is also staying at
the Salt Business Guild.

682
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,300
Yellow Heaven needs to collect
large amounts of fresh human blood,

683
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,450
and now all blood-nourishing tonics

684
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,820
have been bought up.

685
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:17,650
Everything points to
the Salt Business Guild too.

686
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,580
It's very likely

687
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,780
that Yellow Heaven is
keeping people captive

688
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,780
and improving their blood quality first.

689
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,130
When the time is right,

690
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,830
they'll extract their blood
for the ritual.

691
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,170
So those people are...

692
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,460
This adoption scheme

693
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,500
is very likely

694
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,760
Yellow Heaven's trap.

695
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:34,700
Luring people with promises of wealth...

696
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,850
Tricking them into going there,

697
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:40,580
and then killing them for their blood.

698
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,540
Most who go there

699
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,060
are parentless ruffians and beggars.

700
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,650
Even if they disappear or die,

701
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,300
no one will report it.

702
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:49,850
What should we do next?

703
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,850
The best approach now

704
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,850
is for someone to pose as an adopted son

705
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:56,850
and infiltrate the Salt Business Guild
to investigate.

706
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:57,540
I'll go.

707
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,500
No,

708
00:30:58,890 --> 00:30:59,980
you're from Weizhou.

709
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,740
You'll definitely be recognized.

710
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,540
I'll go then.

711
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,020
I can disguise myself as a man.

712
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,480
The situation inside is unclear.

713
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,610
A woman disguised as a man
can be easily discovered.

714
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:08,410
I'll go.

715
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,370
No way.

716
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,060
Your martial skills are too poor.

717
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,060
If you're discovered,

718
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,370
you'll barely be able to protect yourself.

719
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,370
You're too timid.

720
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:20,980
If you're exposed,
it'll be even more troublesome.

721
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,740
My martial arts skills aren't great,

722
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,610
but I'm just going to
pretend to be an adopted son,

723
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:26,540
not to commit aggravated robbery.

724
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,820
Compared to you,

725
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,170
I might be a bit less brave

726
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:30,980
and not bold enough
for fighting and killing,

727
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,210
but it's definitely enough

728
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:33,410
for sneaking around.

729
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,270
Don't worry.

730
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,690
Besides, for this mission to succeed,

731
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:38,350
it requires meticulousness.

732
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:39,340
I'm a coroner.

733
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,400
No one is more meticulous than me.

734
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,420
No one is more suitable than me.

735
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:46,780
Beiming.

736
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:49,740
I'll go.

737
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:06,780
Then let's do

738
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,240
as Coroner Feng suggests.

739
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,030
Dairong,

740
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:09,980
please help Coroner Feng

741
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,110
cover up his wounds.

742
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:11,910
Tong Shuang,

743
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,540
go scout the Salt Business Guild.

744
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,410
See if there are any

745
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:15,670
suitable places around it for an ambush.

746
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:17,170
In case something really happens,

747
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,020
we need to be able

748
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,020
to rush in and save him immediately.

749
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,840
You all go ahead without worry.

750
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,850
What you're doing now

751
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,260
is more effective for me

752
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:37,610
than any cure in this world.

753
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,100
I'll wait here for your return.

754
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,020
Beiming.

755
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:42,340
Tong Shuang.

756
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,100
