[The Wanted Detective]

2
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,890
[Episode 11]

3
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,789
No.

4
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,320
It wasn't me. It wasn't me.

5
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,509
Feng Qingzhuo. Feng Qingzhuo.

6
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:49,039
It's okay now.

7
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:49,590
It wasn't me.

8
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,320
Feng Qingzhuo! Feng Qingzhuo!

9
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,120
It's okay now.

10
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,700
How did I end up here?

11
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,729
Tell me first,

12
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,160
what happened back then?

13
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,360
Back then,

14
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,510
on my way back to Dingfeng Pavilion,

15
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,310
I noticed a medicine bottle was missing,

16
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:10,039
so I hurried back to
the Huo Mansion to look for it.

17
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,460
Suddenly I saw Mrs. Huo

18
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,210
hurrying toward the backyard.

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,470
Mrs. Huo was alone,

20
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,560
looking anxious.

21
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,120
And the backyard is

22
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,560
where the Huo family disciples live.

23
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,160
I thought it was suspicious,

24
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,750
so I followed her.

25
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,310
When I woke up,

26
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,660
Xue Qianshan's body

27
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,140
was lying right next to me.

28
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,360
I... I don't know

29
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,360
what happened.

30
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,590
It's Mrs. Huo again.

31
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,970
I really didn't kill him.

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,030
I swear I didn't kill him.

33
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,870
I'm not a murderer.

34
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,910
Beiming, what should I do?

35
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,750
Don't panic.

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,770
This case

37
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,840
isn't that complicated.

38
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,680
Zhuge Kongyun said the same thing.

39
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,680
Did he discover something

40
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,750
that I missed?

41
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,000
Xueman,

42
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,250
when you arrived at

43
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,190
Feng Qingzhuo's place,

44
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,010
when did the people

45
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,030
from the Huo family arrive?

46
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,750
Stop him.

47
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,710
It was only a short while

48
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,530
before Mrs. Huo arrived
with a group of disciples

49
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,660
from the Huo family.

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,600
That's exactly the problem.

51
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:19,920
What do you mean?

52
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,320
I... I don't understand.

53
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,600
Look.

54
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,120
This is where the disciples live.

55
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,470
This is where Xue Qianshan lives.

56
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,630
Both are in the backyard.

57
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,840
It is not surprising

58
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,310
that the disciples rushed to the scene

59
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,870
as soon as they heard the shouting.

60
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,079
But Mrs. Huo lives in the south courtyard.

61
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,190
From the south courtyard to the backyard,

62
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,850
even if the servants went to report

63
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:45,690
immediately,

64
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,570
it would take some time

65
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,060
to go back and forth.

66
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,170
Mrs. Huo immediately arrived
with a group of disciples

67
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,400
from the Huo family,

68
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,000
which is the inconsistency.

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,520
And Coroner Feng also mentioned

70
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,360
that he saw

71
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,360
Mrs. Huo entering the backyard at dusk.

72
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,470
This means

73
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,840
Mrs. Huo was in the backyard

74
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,400
from dusk until late night.

75
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,310
So... what?

76
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,820
What does that prove?

77
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,400
Mrs. Huo

78
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,280
secretly

79
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,240
sneaked into

80
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,420
the backyard alone

81
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,030
and stayed until late night.

82
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,830
What do you think that suggests?

83
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,430
Are you suggesting

84
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,680
she was having an affair
with one of the disciples?

85
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,950
If this is true,

86
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,300
then the man she was having an affair with

87
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,160
is Li Xiao.

88
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,160
Why would it be Li Xiao?

89
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,860
I think Huo Dairong must have

90
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,120
discovered this affair.

91
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,680
That night
when we sneaked into the Huo Mansion,

92
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,110
she deliberately led me to the bedroom,

93
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,490
probably wanting me to catch

94
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,950
Mrs. Huo and Li Xiao in the act.

95
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,070
Unfortunately, I arrived too late.

96
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,870
[Noble Character, Pure Integrity]

97
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,270
Li Xiao had already left,

98
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,870
leaving only Mrs. Huo behind.

99
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:39,940
Not only that,

100
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,480
Huo Dairong once told me

101
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,240
Mrs. Huo wasn't happy after her marriage,

102
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,390
until Li Xiao
joined the household 3 years ago,

103
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,310
and only then did her mood improve.

104
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,740
When did you

105
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:48,920
join General Huo's service?

106
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,600
Have you ever
gone to battle with General Huo?

107
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,510
I joined the household 3 years ago,

108
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:55,040
too late to have seen
any battlefield action.

109
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,159
That could just be a coincidence.

110
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:59,420
There's something even more important.

111
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,880
I think I've seen

112
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,030
this mark somewhere before.

113
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,050
This is the unique mark

114
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,000
of the Kunwu Knife Factory.

115
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,560
Kunwu Knife Factory?

116
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,950
Do you still remember what I told you

117
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,700
about Mrs. Huo's father,

118
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,160
who runs a weapon workshop?

119
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,810
Xueman and I saw a small knife

120
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,920
at Li Xiao's bedside,

121
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,510
-and there's this mark on the knife.
-It’s a gift from my family.

122
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,510
I keep it by my bedside

123
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,440
to think of my family day and night.

124
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,190
Family?

125
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,510
Or lover?

126
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,200
So I guess this knife

127
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,730
was a gift from Mrs. Huo.

128
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,600
Moreover,

129
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,480
they must have been lovers before.

130
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,500
Could it be that General Huo

131
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,890
was killed by them?

132
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,310
A murder for love?

133
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,720
Without catching them in the act,

134
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,110
even with this kind of evidence,

135
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,190
we can't prove anything.

136
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,070
Then what does this have to do

137
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,600
with Xue Qianshan's death?

138
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,870
Xueman,

139
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,810
do you remember the conversation

140
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:02,630
between Xue Qianshan and Li Xiao

141
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,190
at the entrance of the gambling den?

142
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,570
The property of the entire Huo family

143
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,690
is in your hands,

144
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,320
far more than just 500 taels.

145
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,420
Those despicable things you've done

146
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,510
will not only ruin your reputation,

147
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,300
but you can forget about taking

148
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,000
even a single tael from the Huo family.

149
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,040
Perhaps even Master

150
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,360
was killed by you two.

151
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:21,560
-Master’s death has nothing to do with us.
-Xue was referring to the two of them,

152
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,430
not just one.

153
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,660
He also mentioned
the despicable things they've done.

154
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,360
So I suspect Xue Qianshan had

155
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,920
evidence of the affair between Li Xiao

156
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,160
and Mrs. Huo.

157
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,720
Huo Dairong also mentioned

158
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,000
Xue Qianshan told her

159
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,140
he had something valuable

160
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,720
that could bring him continuous income.

161
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,800
That matches up.

162
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,120
I understand now.

163
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,090
So,

164
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,720
Mrs. Huo and Li Xiao
were having an affair,

165
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,430
and then

166
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,480
Xue Qianshan got hold of evidence,

167
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,200
and he used this evidence

168
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,390
to blackmail Li Xiao.

169
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,280
Li Xiao and Mrs. Huo
couldn't take it anymore,

170
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,450
so they killed Xue Qianshan

171
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,580
and framed me for it.

172
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,800
Everything makes sense now.

173
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,170
Then the evidence Xue Qianshan had

174
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,120
is what we need!

175
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,720
The evidence
must still be at the Huo Mansion.

176
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,360
I'll go there right now.

177
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,190
It's too late.

178
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,460
If it was

179
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,430
really that important,

180
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,240
once Xue Qianshan died,

181
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,220
Li Xiao and Mrs. Huo

182
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,020
would definitely have taken it.

183
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,120
But without the evidence,

184
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,040
without proof,

185
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,260
Coroner Feng cannot

186
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,240
prove his innocence.

187
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,970
Don't worry.

188
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,410
I've asked Tong Shuang
to watch the Huo Mansion.

189
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,140
If anything happens,

190
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,800
he'll notify us immediately.

191
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,810
Zhuge Kongyun

192
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,070
also seemed to know everything.

193
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,680
Could he have reached
the same conclusion as you?

194
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,800
With his intelligence,

195
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,190
it's not surprising that he could

196
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,320
figure all this out.

197
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,360
Beiming,

198
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,630
Constable Zhong,

199
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,510
this time

200
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,880
I owe you both so much.

201
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,930
Otherwise, I...

202
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,800
Go get changed.

203
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,720
Don't catch a cold.

204
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,360
Alright.

205
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,770
Next time if I pass out again,

206
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,530
just use a needle on my Baihui acupoint

207
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,990
and that will do the trick.

208
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,800
No need to splash me with water again.

209
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,600
Go now.

210
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,310
-Don’t... splash water.
-Go now.

211
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,070
Will everything be alright?

212
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,760
Don't worry. I've arranged everything.

213
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,740
I never thought

214
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,140
it would come to this.

215
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,690
The property of the whole family

216
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:15,310
has really fallen into

217
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,120
the hands of Huo Dairong and her mother.

218
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,980
Those constables

219
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,480
will investigate us sooner or later.

220
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,970
Before they figure it out,

221
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,630
we should leave as soon as possible.

222
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,190
The property is just material possession.

223
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,210
As long as we're safe and together,

224
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,610
that's all that matters.

225
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,960
Zhuge Kongyun suspects you?

226
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,360
It's my fault
for not being careful enough,

227
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,750
making him suspicious.

228
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,510
I managed to cover it up last night,

229
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,309
but with his suspicious nature,

230
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,750
he'll definitely
keep a close eye on me from now on.

231
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,250
I'm afraid if I can't hide it well enough,

232
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,550
something might go wrong.

233
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,530
You're not really someone

234
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,360
who knows how to lie and cover things up.

235
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,420
With his keen eyes,

236
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,580
no matter how well you try to hide it,

237
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,180
you won't escape his notice.

238
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,640
What should I do then?

239
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,720
Then don't hide anything.

240
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,550
Be yourself.

241
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:59,850
Didn't he say

242
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,340
you're like your old self?

243
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,000
Then just

244
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,090
be your old self.

245
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,390
As long as you're confident,

246
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,840
do whatever you want.

247
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,550
He can't do anything to you.

248
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,270
My old self?

249
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,440
So you're saying

250
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,910
if he suspects me again,

251
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,400
I should just beat him up?

252
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,560
That's not a bad idea.

253
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,030
I've been wanting to beat him up.

254
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,480
I'm actually looking forward to it now.

255
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,320
Hit him hard.

256
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,690
I've been
putting up with him for too long.

257
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,960
Beiming.

258
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,510
What is it?

259
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,760
Something's happening at the Huo Mansion.

260
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,160
[Huo Mansion]

261
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,970
Mrs. Huo left early this morning

262
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,000
for Biyun Temple,

263
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,240
saying she wanted to pray for blessings.

264
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,630
I guess she'll be back tonight.

265
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,550
She'll be back tonight?

266
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,120
Yes.

267
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:27,360
Okay.

268
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,190
Young Master,

269
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,010
perhaps we should wait for her to return.

270
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,240
Going to Biyun Temple

271
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,480
is just a day trip,

272
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,630
no need to bring much luggage.

273
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,790
The wheel tracks
would be relatively shallow.

274
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,480
Look at these two wheel tracks.

275
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,370
They're deep.

276
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,920
Clearly the carriage

277
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,120
was loaded with valuables and luggage.

278
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,370
It doesn't look like

279
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,870
she's coming back.

280
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,480
Then...

281
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,740
She... she's escaped?

282
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,030
Take more men
and go after her immediately.

283
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,670
Yes.

284
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,670
Sir,

285
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,400
help me with the luggage.

286
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,600
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

287
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,750
We need to get going.

288
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,480
You two seem in quite a hurry.

289
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,840
Where are you going?

290
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,260
Be sensible.

291
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,170
Don't make us use force.

292
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,730
We won't go with you.

293
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,750
We'll fight if we have to.

294
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,440
Xiao!

295
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,480
Don't!

296
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,440
Beiming, what should we do next?

297
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,790
Take them to
the Secret Investigation Unit.

298
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,200
The Secret Investigation Unit?

299
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,060
What about you?

300
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,200
I need to go back to the Huo Mansion.

301
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,030
Alright.

302
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:08,390
[Huo Mansion]

303
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,440
No wonder you're the top constable
in the Qi Kingdom.

304
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,360
You've caught the murderers so quickly.

305
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,390
Miss Huo, I have a favor to ask.

306
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,000
What can I do for you, Mr. Xiao?

307
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,200
I'm at your service.

308
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,270
Could you take me to

309
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,000
General Huo's study for a look?

310
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,080
My father's study?

311
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,980
What do you want to see?

312
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,000
There are still some clues
I haven't figured out.

313
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,860
I'd like to investigate further.

314
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,270
We're still searching,

315
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,050
yet you've brought them back.

316
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,320
This means before I discovered

317
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,850
their escape this morning,

318
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,460
you already had your suspicions.

319
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,520
Why didn't you say anything about it?

320
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,610
Or perhaps someone behind you

321
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:48,140
has been giving you answers,

322
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,130
and you were lying in wait for them?

323
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,200
Constable Zhong,

324
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,000
don't you want to

325
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,360
explain yourself to me?

326
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,000
What are you doing?

327
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,670
Do I need to explain myself to you?

328
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,960
What exactly do I need to explain?

329
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,790
You've repeatedly

330
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,000
questioned me in roundabout ways.

331
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,440
Am I a prisoner of your
Secret Investigation Unit?

332
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,960
If it weren't for our cooperation,

333
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,820
and my consideration
for the bigger picture,

334
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,870
I wouldn't have tolerated this
again and again.

335
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,120
You take my patience for granted

336
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,390
and keep picking fights with me.

337
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,570
You already discovered the truth

338
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,960
about Coroner Feng's case.

339
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,550
Did you ever explain that to me?

340
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,800
If I hadn't figured it out myself

341
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,910
and gone to stake out the Huo Mansion,

342
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,600
I wouldn't have noticed them

343
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,790
sneaking out

344
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,680
and followed them all the way.

345
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,480
I went through all that trouble
to catch them for you,

346
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,510
and now you're taking

347
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,000
the tone of an interrogator with me.

348
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,120
Who do you think you are?

349
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,720
I...

350
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,480
Calm down.

351
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:32,910
Calm down.

352
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,870
If you don't want to cooperate,

353
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:37,930
I'll take them back

354
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,280
to the Elite Constabulary Unit right now.

355
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,720
But if you dare provoke me again,

356
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,160
I swear I'll beat you up just like before

357
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,240
so badly that you won't be able
to get out of bed.

358
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,080
It's my fault.

359
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,120
I apologize to you.

360
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,960
Let's talk things through properly
from now on.

361
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,290
Don't get angry.
It's bad for your health.

362
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,720
She has such a short fuse.

363
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,340
She hasn't changed a bit.

364
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,230
Have you found anything?

365
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,790
Miss Huo, what is this?

366
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:10,910
I've never

367
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,360
entered this study before,

368
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,570
so I don't really know

369
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,000
what my father was doing.

370
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,480
As you can see,

371
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,450
the Secret Investigation Unit

372
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,390
has many ways to deal with suspects.

373
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,060
If you don't want to suffer,

374
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,750
just answer whatever is asked.

375
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,520
Don't worry, both of you.

376
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,200
We won't force a confession.

377
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,870
As long as you tell the truth,

378
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,070
we won't make things difficult for you.

379
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,860
What do you want to ask?

380
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,030
You killed

381
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,790
Xue Qianshan, right?

382
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,760
Xue Qianshan discovered

383
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,630
your affair,

384
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,030
and blackmailed you for money,

385
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,750
so you decided to kill him.

386
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,540
Coincidentally, Coroner Feng

387
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,550
showed up unexpectedly last night,

388
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,600
and you took the opportunity

389
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,730
to kill Xue Qianshan

390
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,390
and frame Coroner Feng.

391
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,130
Am I right?

392
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,550
I confess.

393
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,320
I did kill Xue Qianshan.

394
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,030
Xiao!

395
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,720
He blackmailed me and Ying.

396
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,780
He deserved to die.

397
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,240
I know what you're trying to do,

398
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,970
but the crime

399
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,840
isn't something
you can just take the blame for.

400
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,510
Because you didn't kill him,

401
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,200
Mrs. Huo did.

402
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,970
You're talking nonsense!

403
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,270
Last night when I examined

404
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,599
the wound, I discovered

405
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:07,240
that the fatal stab wound

406
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,400
on Xue Qianshan's body

407
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,829
was delivered from below upward.

408
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,630
Judging from the angle of entry,

409
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,200
the killer's height must be

410
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,730
at least 10 inches
shorter than Xue Qianshan,

411
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,680
and Mrs. Huo's height

412
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,819
is exactly 10 inches
shorter than Xue Qianshan.

413
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,550
Although your martial skills

414
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,200
aren't as good as Xue Qianshan's,

415
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,349
he would have been on guard against you,

416
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:27,630
making it nearly impossible for you

417
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,200
to kill him face-to-face.

418
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,990
But someone who appears

419
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,310
as fragile as Mrs. Huo

420
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,640
could lower his guard,

421
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,550
and killed him with one strike.

422
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,310
I told you.

423
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,160
I killed him.

424
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,880
Xiao!

425
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,030
Yes,

426
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,920
I killed him.

427
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,660
If Xue Qianshan disappeared,

428
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:55,960
no one would know about

429
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,690
the secret between Xiao and me.

430
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,200
The Huo family's property

431
00:17:59,200 --> 00:17:59,880
would naturally

432
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,200
fall into my hands.

433
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,240
I thought

434
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,420
that if I did it myself, it wouldn't

435
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,750
raise suspicion easily,

436
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,080
but I never expected...

437
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,200
Ying.

438
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,920
General Huo's death

439
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,200
is also connected to you, isn't it?

440
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,440
No, I didn't kill General Huo.

441
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,250
General Huo's death

442
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,680
has nothing to do with us.

443
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,720
Xue Qianshan was merely asking for money

444
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,780
when he was killed.

445
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:29,880
If General Huo

446
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,350
had discovered your affair,

447
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,350
you probably
wouldn't have survived, right?

448
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,310
How could General Huo's death

449
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,750
have nothing to do with you?

450
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,580
General Huo's death

451
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,720
truly has nothing to do with us.

452
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,550
Hallucinogenic drugs were found

453
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,810
in General Huo's body.

454
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,000
The pharmacy has always been

455
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,400
under Mrs. Huo's supervision,

456
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,640
and if poison is found

457
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,720
in those tonics,

458
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,650
it would be irrefutable evidence.

459
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,810
I have evidence

460
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,540
that can prove our innocence.

461
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,640
This is strange.

462
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,590
What's this

463
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,790
on the pill?

464
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,680
Well,

465
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,400
what have you found?

466
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,670
It seems to be some kind of medicine

467
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,920
that was ground up

468
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,050
and mixed into General Huo's

469
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,480
daily tonics.

470
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,060
But this pill...

471
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,440
There's something wrong with it?

472
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,720
The powder on it

473
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,440
contains mainly red crystal.

474
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,070
The red crystal is extremely rare.

475
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,350
I've only seen it mentioned

476
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,830
in my master's ancient books.

477
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,000
A trace of it can cause hallucinations.

478
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,160
So this confirms

479
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,940
that General Huo died from

480
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,680
consuming hallucinogenic drugs.

481
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,400
But the red crystal is incredibly rare.

482
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,160
It must be extracted from

483
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,960
rare minerals.

484
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,770
The extraction process is very complex.

485
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:14,960
Those who can extract the red crystal

486
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,560
must be experts in pharmacy.

487
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:19,120
There's no one like that
in the Huo family.

488
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,730
What kind of evidence is this?

489
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,480
My hands

490
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,310
were crippled by General Huo.

491
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,600
In other words,

492
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,880
he had long known about

493
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,480
my relationship with Ying.

494
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,410
What did you say?

495
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,510
Back then,

496
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:41,690
my father and brother

497
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,270
forced me to marry General Huo

498
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,960
to save the knife factory.

499
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,270
But before marrying him,

500
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,880
Xiao and I had already

501
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,740
pledged ourselves to each other.

502
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,750
After marrying General Huo,

503
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,490
I lived in constant fear.

504
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,130
Until 3 years ago,

505
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,500
Xiao was willing to sell himself

506
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,120
to become
General Huo's disciple just for me.

507
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,680
But General Huo was shrewd and ruthless.

508
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,280
We couldn't hide it from him.

509
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,030
Six months ago,

510
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,270
General Huo

511
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,290
discovered our relationship.

512
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,510
In a fit of rage,

513
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,790
[Senior and virtuous]

514
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,350
he beat me up badly.

515
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,700
My wounds haven't healed to this day.

516
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,550
And Xiao,

517
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,980
in order to appease General Huo's anger,

518
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,110
went so far as to sacrifice his hands,

519
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,960
plunging them into a pot of boiling oil

520
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,070
as penance.

521
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,800
If General Huo found out about

522
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,930
your relationship,

523
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,200
would he still keep you
at the Huo Mansion?

524
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,070
To be honest,

525
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,050
I've never understood

526
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,030
this matter either.

527
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:52,870
Later on,

528
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,420
he just stayed in his study,

529
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,720
ignoring both me and Xiao,

530
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,440
acting as if

531
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,750
nothing had happened.

532
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,210
The more he acted this way,

533
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:02,740
the more anxious we became.

534
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,070
With his influence,

535
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,880
we didn't dare run anywhere.

536
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,510
We suffered like this

537
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,480
until the day before he died.

538
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,440
He did something

539
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,480
that Xiao and I

540
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,110
still can't understand.

541
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,200
Master.

542
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,890
[Divorce Agreement]

543
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,130
Divorce agreement?

544
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,750
The evidence Xue Qianshan obtained

545
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,880
was precisely this divorce agreement.

546
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,750
Recently,

547
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,590
I discovered I was pregnant.

548
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,030
General Huo had got
some unmentionable disease,

549
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:55,880
so he certainly knew

550
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,110
the child wasn't his.

551
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,840
Unmentionable disease?

552
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,790
General Huo was infertile.

553
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,070
He was seriously wounded

554
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,920
on the battlefield in his early years.

555
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,590
He had been taking medicine all along

556
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,030
but he never got better.

557
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,110
Once Ying's pregnancy became visible,

558
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,510
we would certainly die.

559
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,960
Death seemed inevitable either way,

560
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,400
so I confessed to General Huo

561
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,730
about the whole affair.

562
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,980
But to my surprise,

563
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,940
he gave me this divorce agreement.

564
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,110
It stated that

565
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:25,280
[Divorce Agreement]

566
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,120
although he despised me,

567
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:25,550
for the sake of the child

568
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,560
[Draftsman of the Divorce Agreement:
Husband Huo Zongyao]

569
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,830
in my womb,

570
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,400
he would spare Xiao and me

571
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,480
and let us live.

572
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,510
General Huo treated us so well.

573
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,170
We couldn't be more grateful.

574
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:35,000
How could we possibly kill him?

575
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,750
You claim this divorce agreement

576
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,500
was given to you

577
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,270
the day before General Huo died,

578
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,750
but you didn't leave.

579
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,400
Was it because his death

580
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,400
gave you some wicked ideas?

581
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,590
Yes.

582
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,930
General Huo died suddenly.

583
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,310
We discovered that no one knew

584
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,970
about the divorce agreement.

585
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:58,110
If Ying continued as Mrs. Huo,

586
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,510
we could rightfully

587
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,000
inherit all the property.

588
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,500
But unexpectedly,

589
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,270
Xue Qianshan stole the divorce agreement

590
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,590
to blackmail us.

591
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,820
But we never intended to kill him.

592
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,490
We just wanted to talk to him

593
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,960
and see if we could use some money

594
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,890
to buy back the divorce agreement.

595
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:15,720
But

596
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,880
we never expected...

597
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,370
I have something valuable.

598
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:22,350
Making money with it
is the most reliable way.

599
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,590
What could be so valuable?

600
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,070
It isn't valuable itself,

601
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:28,960
but it can bring me

602
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,160
a lot of money.

603
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,170
Really?

604
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,370
You don't believe me?

605
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,510
Fine.

606
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,070
I'll bring it

607
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,270
to show you right now.

608
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,200
Wait for me, Dairong.

609
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,640
If Huo Dairong saw

610
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,110
this divorce agreement

611
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,400
and knew

612
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,370
that she was the only heir

613
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,480
to the Huo family,

614
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,640
then we would be done for.

615
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,790
So

616
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,510
we had no choice but to kill him

617
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,400
and used that unconscious coroner

618
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,340
as a scapegoat.

619
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,240
Ying,

620
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,240
how could you be so careless?

621
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,440
What should we do now?

622
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,270
The top priority now
is the matter at hand.

623
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,600
Carry him inside first.

624
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:16,160
General Huo
had been poisoned for a long time.

625
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,680
As someone close to him,

626
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,550
and as the person

627
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,030
in charge of General Huo's pharmacy,

628
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:20,880
have you noticed

629
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,940
anything unusual?

630
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,350
Speaking of unusual things,

631
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:26,720
there were some.

632
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,880
But I only noticed them

633
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,020
after his death.

634
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,100
Feng Qingzhuo.

635
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,250
Why does this pill

636
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,400
have such a fishy stench?

637
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,030
Of course.

638
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,260
The red crystal naturally

639
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,680
has this distinctive fishy odor.

640
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,030
If it's not properly processed,

641
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,630
it's quite easy to identify.

642
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,200
That's not right.

643
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,750
What is it?

644
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,160
If that's the case,

645
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,300
then Mrs. Huo and Li Xiao

646
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,830
might not be the murderers.

647
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,160
What?

648
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,330
Didn't you say that

649
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,600
General Huo had been taking this medicine

650
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,550
for at least half a year?

651
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,550
This medicine is so foul-smelling.

652
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:07,540
How could General Huo not have noticed

653
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,030
after taking it for so long?

654
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:09,980
What do you mean?

655
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,570
Are you suggesting

656
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,120
someone used these pills

657
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,890
deliberately to misdirect us?

658
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,660
Exactly.

659
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,880
But this person was too obvious

660
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,310
and ended up revealing flaws in his plan.

661
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,140
If Mrs. Huo and Li Xiao

662
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,280
were not the murderers,

663
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,410
then who would it be?

664
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,050
Feng Qingzhuo.

665
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:31,080
Please find Tong Shuang for me.

666
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,470
I have something for him to do.

667
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,160
Okay.

668
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,790
General Huo came from
a military background.

669
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,480
He used to have a bad temper

670
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,110
and was rather harsh
with the household staff,

671
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,070
resorting to physical violence sometimes,

672
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,780
but he was also fair and impartial,

673
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,240
keeping strictly the rules
for reward and punishment.

674
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,240
But over the past six months,

675
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:58,900
his temper

676
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,480
had become increasingly erratic,

677
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,880
and he frequently
resorted to physical violence.

678
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,000
His disciples

679
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,230
suffered terribly.

680
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,750
A few days ago, I passed by his study

681
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,240
and heard strange noises.

682
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,640
And I actually saw...

683
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,310
Master.

684
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:29,640
Master.

685
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,640
Eating raw meat

686
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,400
like a wild beast?

687
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,000
That should be a symptom

688
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,640
of the hallucinogenic drugs
that General Huo took.

689
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,440
The next day when I saw him again,

690
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,400
he had absolutely no memory

691
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,330
of what happened the night before.

692
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,930
I didn't dare to make a fuss,

693
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,590
so I kept it

694
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,750
to myself.

695
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,110
Soon after,

696
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,920
he handed me the divorce agreement.

697
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,180
I've told you everything.

698
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,590
It was our greed

699
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,920
that caused this terrible mistake.

700
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,640
I'm willing to confess
and accept punishment

701
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,440
but I have one request

702
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:22,720
that I hope you both can grant.

703
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,750
Speak.

704
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,350
A life for a life.

705
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,830
I killed Xue Qianshan

706
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,590
and I'll pay with my life.

707
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,110
But before that,

708
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,310
would you allow me

709
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,840
to give birth to this child?

710
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,810
This child is innocent.

711
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:41,550
Ying.

712
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:52,440
It's granted.

713
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,110
According to the laws of the Qi Kingdom,

714
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,750
pregnant women who commit capital crimes

715
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:57,550
must wait until the child is born

716
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:59,350
before execution.

717
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,090
I'll ensure your child is born safely

718
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,270
before the case is solved.

719
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,390
Thank you, Constable Zhong.

720
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,730
Thank you, Lord Zhuge.

721
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,680
Thank you.

722
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:13,960
Thank you.

723
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:23,590
Li Long.

724
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,880
Prepare two clean cells.

725
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:26,750
Also,

726
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,640
do not torture Mrs. Huo.

727
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,200
Without my permission,

728
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,960
no one is allowed to interrogate her.

729
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,590
Yes.

730
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,350
That's how it is.

731
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:41,960
Mrs. Huo and Li Xiao

732
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,880
are not the murderers of General Huo.

733
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,900
If they're not the murderers,

734
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,030
who could it be?

735
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,110
Tong Shuang.

736
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,630
I found out

737
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,550
that for the past six months, General Huo

738
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,200
had been sleeping alone
in his study at night.

739
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,240
This matches the interrogation findings.

740
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,590
General Huo moved to the study

741
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:59,440
because he discovered

742
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,240
the affair between his wife and Li Xiao.

743
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,480
For six months, General Huo

744
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,280
had Madam Feng keep him company.

745
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,440
When his newly wedded wife had an affair,

746
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,310
he came to appreciate
the virtues of his concubine,

747
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,770
which is understandable.

748
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,270
Madam Feng said herself

749
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,650
that she and General Huo
were deeply attached to each other.

750
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:14,790
Yes, deeply attached to each other indeed.

751
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:15,960
The butler also mentioned

752
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,210
that General Huo loved tea.

753
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:18,390
For General Huo's sake, Madam Feng

754
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,510
specifically visited a famous doctor

755
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,880
to learn how to make medicinal tea,

756
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,030
which she brewed for him every day.

757
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,480
General Huo loved it so much.

758
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,750
The butler also said

759
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,510
that General Huo's face

760
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,720
never showed any smile before.

761
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,720
But whenever he drank the tea,

762
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,250
he would grin with delight.

763
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,400
Madam Feng?

764
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,930
Madam Feng had no motive

765
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:36,240
for the murder.

766
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:40,070
The crux of the matter
does not lie with Madam Feng

767
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,270
but with Huo Dairong.

768
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,030
Miss Huo?

769
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,640
What's wrong with her?

770
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,370
The reason we suspect

771
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:46,500
Mrs. Huo and Li Xiao

772
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:47,680
is not unfounded.

773
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,310
Since our night visit to the Huo Mansion,

774
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,550
Huo Dairong has been deliberately

775
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,720
steering our investigation

776
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,920
toward those two.

777
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,590
If it weren't for that divorce agreement,

778
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,240
based solely on the toxic powder
on the medicine

779
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,590
and their affair,

780
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,390
without any other

781
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,320
solid evidence,

782
00:30:59,350 --> 00:30:59,830
it would have been possible to determine

783
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,490
that they were the murderers.

784
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,640
What's wrong, Xueman?

785
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,510
Huo Dairong discovered your identity

786
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,770
but didn't expose you.

787
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,240
Could she be using you

788
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,720
to help her expose the affair

789
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,320
between Mrs. Huo and Li Xiao?

790
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,240
No.

791
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,160
No.

792
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,880
Aren't you overthinking this?

793
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,470
From Miss Huo's perspective,

794
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,550
everything makes perfect sense.

795
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,290
She discovered the affair

796
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:21,590
between Mrs. Huo and Li Xiao.

797
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,840
Her father was killed

798
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,250
and she wanted to bring them to justice.

799
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,350
Is there a problem?

800
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,530
Besides, she had no motive

801
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:27,550
for the murder.

802
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:30,000
Regardless of whether she had motive,

803
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,720
now that Mrs. Huo has been sentenced,

804
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,880
the ones who benefit the most

805
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,550
are Huo Dairong and her mother.

806
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,480
That's a fact.

807
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,360
Speaking of motives,

808
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:41,810
I have a new discovery.

809
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,710
[It's too late to regret
the chaos at Haiya.]

810
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,000
[It's too late to regret
the chaos at Haiya.]

811
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:00,310
It's too late to regret
the chaos at Haiya.

812
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,050
Where did you find this?

813
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:02,920
In General Huo's study.

814
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,880
Well, in that case,

815
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,880
General Huo was indeed

816
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,200
involved in the Haiya case.

817
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,500
Didn't Mrs. Huo mention

818
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,920
that General Huo was infertile?

819
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,720
That's right.

820
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,240
She said he had been seriously wounded

821
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,350
on the battlefield in his early years.

822
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,310
Madam Feng said

823
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,420
General Huo took her as his concubine

824
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,110
after returning from the battlefield,

825
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,440
which was 23 years ago.

826
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,480
What if General Huo was already infertile

827
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,030
before he went to the battlefield?

828
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,020
Are you saying

829
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,550
Huo Dairong might not be

830
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,590
General Huo's biological daughter?

831
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,510
Miss Huo isn't his biological daughter?

832
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,720
How is that possible?

833
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:28,590
How could she possibly

834
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,960
keep that from General Huo?

835
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,270
With General Huo's temperament,

836
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:31,790
how could he possibly

837
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:32,750
allow them to live

838
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,200
in his mansion for so long?

839
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:34,740
What if he had

840
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,000
a reason he couldn't send them away?

841
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,880
What reason?

842
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,710
What year was it 23 years ago?

843
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,400
The 36th year of Ningtai.

844
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,920
Their argument specifically
mentioned this year,

845
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,530
which indicated something suspicious.

846
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:44,180
[The Dossier of the Imperial Secretariat
Zhong Yunchi's Dossier]

847
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:44,930
[The Dossier of the Imperial Secretariat
Zhong Yunchi]

848
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,270
King Zhong of Constables,
in the 36th year of Ningtai...

849
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,510
The 36th year of Ningtai...

850
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,640
[The Dossier of the Imperial Secretariat
Miao Jie]

851
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,680
The 36th year of Ningtai.

852
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,380
[The Dossier of the Imperial Secretariat
Huo Zongyao]

853
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,320
The 36th year of Ningtai...

854
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,510
Haiya...

855
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,640
If Huo Dairong

856
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,240
really had something to do with Haiya,

857
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,830
then General Huo might indeed

858
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,430
have concealed this matter.

859
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,400
Wait.

860
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,550
So this means Huo Dairong could be...

861
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:01,680
An orphan from Haiya.

862
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,400
Every single survivor

863
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,480
of Haiya is Yesha.

864
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,030
As long as there's one survivor

865
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,400
still breathing,

866
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,000
Yesha

867
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,550
will keep coming back.

868
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,860
Then the motive for the murder

869
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,920
makes perfect sense now.

870
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,110
So this case is not

871
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,040
completely unrelated to Yesha.

872
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:19,510
But we don't have any

873
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,550
substantial evidence.

874
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,480
What if General Huo

875
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,750
had Huo Dairong first

876
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:24,400
before going to the battlefield

877
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,310
and getting seriously wounded?

878
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,350
Then all our previous deductions

879
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,270
would be wrong.

880
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:27,960
Yes.

881
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,590
So everything we have now

882
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,720
is just speculation.

883
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,030
But whether we're investigating Haiya

884
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,440
or General Huo's death,

885
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,270
we can't avoid

886
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,440
Huo Dairong and her mother.

887
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,630
Miss Huo doesn't seem like

888
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:37,920
a bad person at all.

889
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,750
You can't judge a book by its cover.

890
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:40,920
You're so naive

891
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,310
that you're easily fooled by women.

892
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,110
We need to go to the Huo Mansion now.

893
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,310
Everyone, get ready.

894
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,240
What's the reason

895
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,270
for us to go this time?

896
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,400
Medical treatment.

897
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,230
Madam Feng
has a deficiency in vital energy,

898
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:15,000
which fails to nourish
her tendons and vessels,

899
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,530
resulting in blood stasis.

900
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,170
If she doesn't rest properly,

901
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,460
I'm afraid...

902
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,389
I know my own physical condition

903
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,320
very well.

904
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,880
Coroner Feng,

905
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,630
just put it plainly.

906
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,560
I'm afraid you might become paralyzed.

907
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,300
Mr. Feng, please save my mother.

908
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,960
As long as you can save my mother,

909
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,320
I'm willing to do anything.

910
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:47,760
Dairong.

911
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,590
Miss Huo, please get up.

912
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:52,230
Miss Huo, as a doctor,

913
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,000
I will do my best.

914
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,590
Thank you, Mr. Feng.

915
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,150
Miss Huo.

916
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,000
I need a quiet place

917
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:05,110
to prepare medicine for Madam Feng.

918
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:05,710
Okay.

919
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,600
Mr. Feng, please follow me.

920
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,710
Goodbye.

921
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,320
Thank you.

922
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,400
You're welcome, Madam.

923
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,230
I'm your junior

924
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,090
and I'm also Miss Huo's friend.

925
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,150
Dairong is truly

926
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,590
fortunate to have

927
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,800
friends like you.

928
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,260
Constable Zhong,

929
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,230
do you have something

930
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,190
to ask me?

931
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,180
I came today

932
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,070
because I do have

933
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,690
some questions for you.

934
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,000
Go ahead.

935
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,280
Then I'll be straightforward.

936
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,620
Miss Huo is not

937
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:01,590
your biological daughter

938
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,760
with General Huo, is she?
