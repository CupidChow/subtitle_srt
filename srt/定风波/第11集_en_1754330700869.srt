00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,680
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,280
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:48,880
Feng Yun Zhuang.

9
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,600
Feng Yun Zhuang.

10
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,280
It's okay.

11
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:50,800
It's not me.

12
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,560
Feng Yun Zhuang.

13
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,360
Feng Yun Zhuang.

14
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,240
It's okay.

15
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,760
Why am I here?

16
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,880
Tell me what happened.

17
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,480
At that time...

18
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,560
On my way back to the Dianfeng Pavilion,

19
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,280
I found out that the medicine was running out.

20
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,920
I hurried back to the mansion to look for it.

21
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,800
Feng Yun Zhuang.

22
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,800
Feng Yun Zhuang.

23
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,800
Feng Yun Zhuang.

24
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,040
I suddenly saw Mrs. Huo and her hurried back to the back garden.

25
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,840
Mrs. Huo was alone and in a hurry.

26
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,480
And the back garden is where the Huo disciples live.

27
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,320
I thought it was abnormal.

28
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,640
So I followed her.

29
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,440
When I woke up,

30
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,080
Xue Qian Shan's body was lying beside me.

31
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,600
I didn't know what happened.

32
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,840
It's Mrs. Huo again.

33
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,080
I didn't kill her.

34
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,160
I didn't kill her.

35
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,040
I didn't kill her.

36
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,880
Brother Xiao.

37
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,960
What should I do?

38
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,960
Don't be nervous.

39
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,840
This case is not that complicated.

40
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,640
That's what Brother Zhu said.

41
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,000
Did he find out something I ignored?

42
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,480
Junior sister.

43
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,280
When you arrived at Fengjing Pavilion,

44
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,480
when did the people from the Huo family arrive?

45
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,960
Stop her.

46
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,800
It was just a moment.

47
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,960
Mrs. Huo came with a group of disciples from the Huo family.

48
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,400
That's the problem.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What do you mean?

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,120
I didn't understand.

51
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,600
Look.

52
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,080
This is where the disciples live.

53
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,440
This is the residence of Xue Qian Shan.

54
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,600
They are all in the back garden.

55
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,720
It's not strange that the disciples heard the shout and rushed to the scene.

56
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,000
But Mrs. Huo lives in the south garden.

57
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,160
The south garden is in the back garden.

58
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,680
Even if the killer rushes to report it at once,

59
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,960
it will take at least half an hour.

60
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,400
Mrs. Huo immediately came with a group of disciples from the Huo family.

61
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,000
That's unreasonable.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,560
And Feng Wu Ze also said

63
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,320
he saw Mrs. Huo enter the back garden at night.

64
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,920
That is to say,

65
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,080
Mrs. Huo has been in the back garden from night to night.

66
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,280
And then?

67
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,720
What does this mean?

68
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,720
Mrs. Huo sneaked into the back garden alone

69
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,280
and stayed there until late at night.

70
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,080
What do you think this means?

71
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,920
You mean

72
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,960
she had a secret relationship with a disciple?

73
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,360
If this is true,

74
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,320
the person she had a secret relationship with was

75
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,720
Li Xiao.

76
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,640
Why is it Li Xiao?

77
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,440
I think Huo Dai Rong also found out about this.

78
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,960
We went to the Huo family at night.

79
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,440
He deliberately led me to the bedroom.

80
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,920
He probably wanted me to bump into

81
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,280
Mrs. Huo and Li Xiao.

82
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,280
It's a pity that I went late.

83
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,440
Li Xiao has left.

84
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,000
Only Mrs. Huo is left.

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Not only that,

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,640
Huo Dai Rong told me before

87
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,440
that Mrs. Huo was not happy when she got married.

88
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,640
Until three years ago,

89
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,400
Li Xiao entered the house and she was in the back garden.

90
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,000
When did Mr. Li enter the home of General Huo?

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,720
Have you ever fought with General Huo?

92
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,560
I entered the house three years ago.

93
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,760
I never went to the battlefield.

94
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,200
It could be a coincidence.

95
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,680
There is one more important point.

96
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,520
I think I've seen this mark somewhere.

97
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,400
This is a mark that is unique to the Kunwu Knife Factory.

98
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,200
Kunwu Knife Factory?

99
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,360
Do you still remember that I told you that Mrs. Huo

100
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,720
and her father run an ice-breaking workshop?

101
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,560
I and my junior sister saw a small knife

102
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,680
at the bedside of the room.

103
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,680
The knife is this mark.

104
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,480
This knife...

105
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,560
This is the mark.

106
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,480
This is the mark.

107
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,360
This is the mark.

108
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,560
This is the mark.

109
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,680
I think it was the mark of the knife.

110
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,280
I think it was the mark.

111
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,280
This is the mark.

112
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,760
This is the mark.

113
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,880
This is the mark.

114
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,880
This is the mark.

115
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,480
This is the mark on the knife.

116
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,480
It's hanging on the bedside

117
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,280
to miss her family day and night.

118
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,480
Family?

119
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,880
Family?

120
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,080
So I guess this knife

121
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,800
was given by Mrs. Huo.

122
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,280
And they must have been together before.

123
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,360
Then General Huo

124
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,160
must have been killed by them.

125
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,280
He was killed by love.

126
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,680
We didn't catch the criminal.

127
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,000
Even if we have such evidence,

128
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,080
we can't prove anything.

129
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,480
What does this have to do with Mr. Xue's death?

130
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:05,960
Junior sister,

131
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,560
do you remember that we were at the door of the gambling house?

132
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,160
Xue Qian Shan and Li Xiao's conversation?

133
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,760
The whole Huo family's property is in your hands.

134
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,360
Not only one 500 taels,

135
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,560
the things you did

136
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,640
will not only be a great loss,

137
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,960
but also not want to take a single silver from the Huo family.

138
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,360
Maybe you killed Master.

139
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,560
Master's death has nothing to do with us.

140
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,560
Xue Qian Shan is talking about you,

141
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,560
not you.

142
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
In addition,

143
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,640
she also mentioned the things that were wrong.

144
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,360
So I guess Xue Qian Shan

145
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,360
should have evidence of the relationship between Li Xiao and Mrs. Huo.

146
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,640
Huo Dairong also said

147
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,040
Xue Qian Shan told her

148
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,120
that she had a treasure in her hand

149
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,720
that she could exchange money all the time.

150
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
This is a match.

151
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,120
I understand.

152
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,720
So it was Mrs. Huo and Li Xiao who had a private conversation.

153
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,320
Then the pen fell into Xue Qian Shan's hand.

154
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,120
Xue Qian Shan took the pen

155
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,120
and tried to please Li Xiao.

156
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,240
Li Xiao and Mrs. Huo couldn't bear it

157
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,320
and killed Xue Qian Shan

158
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,320
and framed me.

159
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,720
Everything is clear.

160
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,320
Then Xue Qian Shan's pen is the evidence.

161
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,640
The pen must still be in the Huo family.

162
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,320
I'll go now.

163
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,320
It's too late.

164
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,320
If this thing is really that important,

165
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,320
if Xue Qian Shan dies,

166
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,320
Li Xiao and Mrs. Huo will definitely take it away.

167
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,320
But there is no evidence.

168
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,320
The seal can't prove it's innocent.

169
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,320
Don't worry.

170
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,520
I'll have Tong Shuang keep an eye on Mrs. Huo.

171
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,320
Once there's something,

172
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,320
she'll inform us immediately.

173
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,320
The assistant Kongyun also looks fierce.

174
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,720
Could it be the same as you?

175
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,920
With his talent,

176
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,120
it's not surprising that he can deduce these things.

177
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,520
Brother Xiao,

178
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,600
I'm happy.

179
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,600
Thanks to you two.

180
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Otherwise, I...

181
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,600
Go back and change your clothes.

182
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,600
Don't catch a cold.

183
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,600
Okay.

184
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,600
If I get lost again,

185
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,600
you can come to my school.

186
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,800
Don't need to get water to splash me.

187
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
Go back.

188
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Or...

189
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Go.

190
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,600
What's wrong?

191
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,600
Don't worry. I've arranged everything.

192
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,600
I didn't expect it to come to this.

193
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,600
This big family business is really cheap.

194
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,600
Those scoundrels will find out about us sooner or later.

195
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,600
Before they react,

196
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,600
we should leave the upper line as soon as possible.

197
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,000
The family business is just an external business.

198
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's good as long as we are safe and sound.

199
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm leaving.

200
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm leaving.

201
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm leaving.

202
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm leaving.

203
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm leaving.

204
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Zhuge Kong Yu is suspicious of you?

205
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yes.

206
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
He blamed me for being not careful enough.

207
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
He was suspicious.

208
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Although I covered him up last night,

209
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
he was suspicious.

210
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
He must keep an eye on me in the future.

211
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm afraid that if I don't cover him up well,

212
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
something will happen.

213
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You are not a person who can lie to cover up.

214
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
In his eyes,

215
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
no matter how well you cover him up,

216
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
you can't escape his eyes.

217
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What should I do?

218
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Then don't cover your eyes.

219
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Be yourself.

220
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
He said you looked like you before.

221
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Then you should be the same as you were before.

222
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You just need to be confident.

223
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Whatever you do,

224
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
you will be what you are.

225
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
He has no way to stop you.

226
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
The same as before?

227
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Then you mean,

228
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
if he suspects me again,

229
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'll beat him up.

230
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Why not?

231
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I really want to beat him up.

232
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm looking forward to it now.

233
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's a little scary.

234
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I've been holding him for a long time.

235
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm sorry.

236
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm sorry.

237
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm sorry.

238
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm sorry.

239
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm sorry.

240
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm sorry.

241
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm sorry.

242
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm sorry.

243
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm sorry.

244
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm sorry.

245
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm sorry.

246
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm sorry.

247
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm sorry.

248
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm sorry.

249
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm sorry.

250
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm sorry.

251
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm sorry.

252
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm sorry.

253
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm sorry.

254
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm sorry.

255
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm sorry.

256
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm sorry.

257
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm sorry.

258
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm sorry.

259
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm sorry.

260
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm sorry.

261
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm sorry.

262
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm sorry.

263
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm sorry.

264
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm sorry.

265
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm sorry.

266
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm sorry.

267
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm sorry.

268
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm sorry.

269
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm sorry.

270
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm sorry.

271
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm sorry.

272
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm sorry.

273
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm sorry.

274
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm sorry.

275
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm sorry.

276
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Brother!

277
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
What's up?

278
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Something went wrong with the rear of the mansion!

279
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Madam went to the tavern in the morning.

280
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
She said it was a guest room.

281
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I guess she'll be back tonight.

282
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
She will be back tonight.

283
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,840
Okay.

284
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,400
Young Master,

285
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,360
let's wait for someone to come back.

286
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,720
We can come back in a day from Biyun Temple.

287
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,920
No need to bring any luggage.

288
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,440
The car will be relatively shallow.

289
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,440
Look at these two car tracks.

290
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,640
They're very deep.

291
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,600
Obviously, the car has a lot of material and luggage.

292
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,680
It doesn't look like

293
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,120
it's going to come back.

294
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,720
Then, he... he's escaped.

295
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,920
Bring more brothers to chase him immediately.

296
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,640
Yes.

297
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,480
Boatman,

298
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,080
help us move our luggage.

299
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,560
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

300
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,640
We have to hurry up.

301
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,160
You two are in such a hurry.

302
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,720
Where are you going?

303
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,120
You two better be practical.

304
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,080
Don't force us to do it.

305
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,440
We won't leave with you.

306
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,560
At worst, we'll fight with you.

307
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,440
Brother Xiao, no.

308
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,700
The

309
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,360
Elder Brother, what do we do next?

310
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,600
Take them to the dark shadow.

311
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,560
The dark shadow?

312
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,960
What about you?

313
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,400
I have to wait for the cargo.

314
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,000
Okay.

315
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,440
I'll be waiting for you.

316
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,320
I'll go and get it.

317
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:11,960
Yes.

318
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,640
You're really the first minister of the Qi.

319
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,480
You caught the murderer so quickly.

320
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,840
Miss Huo, I have a favor to ask.

321
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,560
What can I do for you, Mr. Xiao?

322
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,720
I'm glad to ask.

323
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,880
Can you take me to General Huo's study?

324
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,520
My father's study?

325
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,000
What do you want to see?

326
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,480
I haven't found out any clues yet.

327
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,520
I want to go and find out.

328
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:37,880
Okay.

329
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,440
You brought them back.

330
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,760
This means that

331
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,920
before I found out they escaped this morning,

332
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,280
you had doubts.

333
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,720
Why didn't you say anything?

334
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,040
Or did you say that someone behind you

335
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,400
helped you solve the problem

336
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,280
and you took the lead in advance?

337
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,320
I don't care.

338
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,400
Don't you want to explain it to me?

339
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,200
What are you doing?

340
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,280
Do I need to explain it to you?

341
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,160
What do I need to explain to you?

342
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,240
You've been asking me for many times.

343
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,600
Am I a prisoner of your An Zhenying?

344
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,120
If it weren't for our cooperation,

345
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,840
I would have been the only one in the whole situation.

346
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,280
You're shameless.

347
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,560
You keep asking me for clues.

348
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,000
You've already found out the truth about Feng Wu's case.

349
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,280
Have you explained it to me?

350
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,080
If I didn't want to go to General Huo's study

351
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,960
and found out that two people were sneaking out,

352
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,880
I would have followed them all the way

353
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,600
and worked hard to get them back to you.

354
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,040
Now you're talking to me

355
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,200
as if you're a criminal.

356
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Who do you think you are?

357
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:34,840
I...

358
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,680
Calm down.

359
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,400
Calm down.

360
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,840
Calm down.

361
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,840
If you don't want to cooperate,

362
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,680
I'll take them back to the camp now.

363
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,480
But if you dare to provoke me again,

364
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,720
do you believe that I'll beat you to death

365
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,560
like I used to?

366
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,160
I'm sorry.

367
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,040
I apologize to you.

368
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,960
Let's talk it over in the future.

369
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,840
Don't be angry.

370
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,760
Be angry and hurt yourself.

371
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:06,560
Half an hour later

372
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,280
He didn't change at all,

373
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,160
jointeening with me.

374
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,980
We've known him all our lives.

375
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,480
Keep the secret of our male parlor ours for us.

376
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,280
Put it in here.

377
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,300
We'll have a talk with them tomorrow.

378
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,560
Yes.

379
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,280
Anything interesting?

380
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,780
Miss Hu, what is this?

381
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,440
I've never been into this study before.

382
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,620
So I'm not sure what my father is doing.

383
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,240
The

384
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,320
two of you saw it.

385
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,280
There are too many ways to deal with the suspect in the dark camp.

386
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,120
If you don't want to suffer,

387
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,680
you'd better ask and say something.

388
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,480
Don't be nervous.

389
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,280
We won't go to the city.

390
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,080
As long as you tell the truth,

391
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,480
we won't make it hard for you.

392
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,880
What do you want to ask?

393
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,240
Xue Qianshan,

394
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,080
you killed him, right?

395
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,920
Xue Qianshan found out about your treachery

396
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,080
and threatened you with your money.

397
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,880
So you started to kill him.

398
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,080
Don't worry.

399
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,680
It just so happened that the Wind Wuzuo appeared last night.

400
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,120
You killed Xue Qianshan

401
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,680
and gave the wind Wuzuo the price.

402
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,480
Am I right?

403
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,880
I admit my guilt.

404
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,680
I killed Xue Qianshan.

405
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,480
Brother.

406
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,920
She threatened me and Yingmei.

407
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,120
She is innocent.

408
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,320
I know what you want to do.

409
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,280
But you can't bear the punishment

410
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,520
because you didn't kill her.

411
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,320
It was Mrs. Huo.

412
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,520
Nonsense.

413
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,560
When I checked the wound last night,

414
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,280
I found that the fatal knife hole on Xue Qianshan's body

415
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,720
was cut from the bottom.

416
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,560
Judging from the angle of the knife,

417
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,160
the height of the knife

418
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,520
is at least 10 centimeters shorter than Xue Qianshan's.

419
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,800
Mrs. Huo's height

420
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,920
is exactly 10 centimeters shorter than Xue Qianshan's.

421
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,560
Although Li Xiao's martial arts are not as high as Xue Qianshan's,

422
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,920
she is well-prepared for you.

423
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,040
You almost can't kill her face to face.

424
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,160
Instead, you look like a weak Mrs. Huo.

425
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,480
You can thank her for her defense.

426
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,240
A knife is more powerful than a sword.

427
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,040
I said I killed her.

428
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,760
Brother.

429
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,520
Yes.

430
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,320
I killed her.

431
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,040
As long as Xue Qianshan disappears,

432
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,640
no one will know the secret of me and Brother Xiao.

433
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,520
The Huo family's property

434
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,640
will naturally be in my hands.

435
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,000
I thought it wouldn't be easy for people to suspect me.

436
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,240
But I didn't expect...

437
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,840
Yingmei.

438
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,400
General Huo's death

439
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,000
is also related to you, right?

440
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:24,840
No.

441
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,760
General Huo, it's not my fault.

442
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
General's death has nothing to do with us.

443
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,040
Xue Qianshan was just begging for money,

444
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,040
and he was killed.

445
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,720
If General Huo knew about your evil intentions,

446
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,440
you might have lost your lives.

447
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,760
How could General Huo's death

448
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,040
have nothing to do with you?

449
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,040
General Huo's death

450
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,040
really has nothing to do with us.

451
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,880
General Huo's body

452
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,240
found a drug.

453
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,400
And the drugstore has always been under Mrs. Huo's supervision.

454
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,040
If poison was found in those tonics,

455
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,280
the poison would be the evidence.

456
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,000
I have evidence

457
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,480
that can prove our innocence.

458
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,840
That's weird.

459
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,120
What's on the drug?

460
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,360
The evidence that Liugusi...

461
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,360
I'm not buying Mixer version is just special

462
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,360
What does your biggestising plan

463
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,600
Previous marketing in the past

464
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,920
You think

465
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,080
enterprises are the majority

466
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,120
I want to return prices

467
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,320
People where are found

468
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,040
more smooth

469
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,020
Surround the small dollar

470
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,600
The small dollarliche

471
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,960
is typically the product that

472
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,960
Haramets brand

473
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,320
换到

474
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,520
In person

475
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,240
So to死

476
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,480
You

477
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,320
Skin care

478
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,840
It should be a kind of pill that's been ground into powder

479
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,760
and mixed into the tonic that General Huo takes every day.

480
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,000
But this pill...

481
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,320
There's something wrong with this pill.

482
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,320
The powder on the pill is mainly made of thymus.

483
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,960
Thymus is extremely rare.

484
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,640
I only saw it in my master's ancient book.

485
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,760
It can cause people to suffer from hallucinations.

486
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,920
That's not exactly a proof.

487
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,520
General Huo takes the drug to kill people.

488
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,240
But thymus is a rare drug in the world.

489
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,800
It must be made from rare minerals.

490
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,520
The process is very complicated.

491
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,800
The one who can practice thymus

492
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,600
must be a master of medicine.

493
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,360
There's no one like Huo Fu.

494
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,240
What kind of proof is this?

495
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,160
This hand was used by General Huo.

496
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,480
In other words,

497
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,320
he already knew about me and Ying Mei.

498
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,520
What did you say?

499
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,080
Back then, my father forced me to go to the battlefield

500
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,560
and marry General Huo.

501
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,640
But before I entered Huo's Mansion,

502
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,400
Xiao Ge and I had already been engaged.

503
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,680
After I entered Huo's Mansion,

504
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,760
I was in a state of panic.

505
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,720
Until three years ago,

506
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,440
Xiao Ge risked his life for me

507
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,440
and became General's master.

508
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,520
But General is old.

509
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,600
I still couldn't hide it from him.

510
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,120
Until half a year ago,

511
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,200
General Huo found out about my relationship with him.

512
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,720
When General was angry,

513
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,360
he hit me with a blow.

514
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,560
I haven't recovered yet.

515
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,640
But Xiao Ge,

516
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,160
in order to appease General's anger,

517
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,960
he used his own hands

518
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,800
to put them into the oil pan

519
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,240
and to atone for his crimes.

520
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,040
General Huo knew about your relationship

521
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,040
and he even kept you in Huo's Mansion.

522
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,760
To be honest,

523
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,960
I didn't understand this matter.

524
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,360
Since then, he has been in the study

525
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,960
and didn't ask me or Xiao Ge about it.

526
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,960
He even pretended that this never happened.

527
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,040
The more he did this,

528
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,680
the more we were panic.

529
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,400
With General's power,

530
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,800
we didn't dare to run away.

531
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,440
We just kept on suffering

532
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,720
until the day before he died.

533
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,200
He even did something

534
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,400
that Xiao Ge and I couldn't figure out.

535
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,320
Master.

536
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,240
The study?

537
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,480
The evidence that Xie Qian Shan got

538
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,400
is exactly this study.

539
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,960
Not long ago,

540
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,720
I found out that I was pregnant.

541
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,080
General Huo had a secret disease.

542
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,400
He must have known that it wasn't his child.

543
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,640
Secret disease?

544
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,960
General Huo doesn't have the ability to have a child.

545
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,920
He was injured on the battlefield in the early years.

546
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,640
He has been taking medicine for years,

547
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,200
but he hasn't recovered.

548
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,600
After Ying Mei's pregnancy,

549
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,440
we both died.

550
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,400
We both died.

551
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,600
So I told General about it.

552
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,520
But General gave me this study.

553
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,000
It said that

554
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,960
although he hates me,

555
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,720
for the sake of my child,

556
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,200
he's willing to let me and Xiao Ge go.

557
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,040
General treats us like this.

558
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,080
We can't even be grateful.

559
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,400
Why would we kill him?

560
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,600
You said that this study

561
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,160
was given to you before General died.

562
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,640
But you didn't leave.

563
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,480
Because of General's death,

564
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,400
you were moved by the thought of it.

565
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,880
Yes.

566
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,680
General died suddenly.

567
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,120
We found out that

568
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,120
no one knew about the study.

569
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,200
If Ying Mei continued to be Mrs. Huo,

570
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,280
we could have collected all the assets

571
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,680
in a fair and proper manner.

572
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,600
But we didn't expect

573
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,000
that Xie Qian Shan stole the study

574
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,440
and threatened us.

575
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,640
But we didn't want to kill him.

576
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,360
We just wanted to talk to him

577
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,800
to see if we could use some money

578
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,240
to buy the study back.

579
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,440
But we didn't expect...

580
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,280
I have a treasure.

581
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,600
I can't rely on it anymore

582
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,240
because it's worth my money.

583
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,480
What treasure is so valuable?

584
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,960
This treasure is not valuable itself,

585
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,160
but it can bring me a lot of money.

586
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,160
Really?

587
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,200
You don't believe me?

588
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,560
Okay.

589
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,200
I'll take the treasure to you right now.

590
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,040
Wait for me, Ruo Mei.

591
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,160
If Huo Dai Rong sees this study

592
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,360
and finds out that

593
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,480
he is the only heir of the Huo family,

594
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,640
we'll be done for.

595
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,920
So,

596
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,320
we have to kill him

597
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,560
and use the fainted coroner to make the final decision.

598
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,200
Ying Mei, why are you so careless?

599
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,400
What should we do now?

600
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,920
Let's just forget about what happened.

601
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,400
Let's take him in first.

602
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,800
General Huo has been poisoned for a long time.

603
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,600
As his sidekick,

604
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,680
you're also in charge of General Huo's pharmacy.

605
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,840
Did you find anything strange?

606
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,080
Something strange?

607
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,680
Yes, I did.

608
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,880
But I only found out after he died.

609
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,400
Feng Jin Chu,

610
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,560
why does the pill have a new smell?

611
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,400
Of course.

612
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,720
There is a special smell in the body.

613
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,240
If you don't treat it,

614
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,560
it's still easy to treat.

615
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,240
No.

616
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,000
What's wrong?

617
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,440
If that's the case,

618
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,680
that murderer is probably not

619
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,800
Mrs. Huo and Li Xiao.

620
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,400
What are you talking about?

621
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,400
Didn't you say

622
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,200
General Huo has to take the medicine for at least half a year

623
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,000
to get rid of the poison?

624
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,960
If you're so worried,

625
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,120
how could you not find out

626
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,280
General Huo has been doing this for so long?

627
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,520
What do you mean?

628
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,000
You mean

629
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,520
someone took the pill

630
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,320
and changed the world on purpose?

631
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,120
That's right.

632
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,320
But this person was too deliberate

633
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,720
and revealed his flaws.

634
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,720
If the murderer is not Mrs. Huo and Li Xiao,

635
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,800
who could it be?

636
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,440
Feng Jin Chu,

637
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,440
help me find a partner.

638
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,440
I have something to do.

639
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,280
I'll go and help him.

640
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,440
Okay.

641
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,800
General Huo was born in the military.

642
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,720
Although he used to be very angry,

643
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,360
he was quite strict with the people in the mansion.

644
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,800
He would sometimes hit people.

645
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,000
But he was always strict with the people.

646
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,480
But in the past half a year,

647
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,520
his temper has become more irregular

648
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,920
and he would often hit people.

649
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,160
His disciples couldn't bear to see it.

650
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,640
A few days ago,

651
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,800
I heard a strange noise

652
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,240
in his study.

653
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,560
I didn't expect to see it.

654
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,320
Master.

655
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,720
Master.

656
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,560
Master.

657
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,520
The stone is as thin as the beast.

658
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,760
That must be the symptom of General Huo's drug.

659
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,360
The next day, I saw General again.

660
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,520
He didn't remember what happened last night.

661
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,920
I didn't dare to say it out.

662
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,760
So I buried it in my heart.

663
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,040
Not long after,

664
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,720
he gave me the embroidery book.

665
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,000
I said everything I should.

666
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,600
It's us.

667
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,600
I'm willing to admit my crime

668
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,480
for the crime of making the wrong embroidery.

669
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,320
But I have one more request.

670
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,480
I hope you two can help me.

671
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,680
Go ahead.

672
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,200
I killed Xue Qianshan

673
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,720
with my own life.

674
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,440
Xue Qianshan is my life.

675
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,920
But before that,

676
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,560
can you let me give birth to this child?

677
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,520
He is innocent.

678
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,520
Yingmei.

679
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,360
I promise you.

680
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,680
According to the law,

681
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,160
a pregnant woman must be sentenced to death

682
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,160
after the child is born.

683
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,240
Before the case is solved,

684
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,040
I'll keep your child safe.

685
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,880
Thank you, Mr. Zhong.

686
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,520
Thank you, Mr. Zhuge.

687
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,560
Thank you.

688
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:18,800
Thank you.

689
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,440
Li Long.

690
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,600
Prepare two clean old rooms.

691
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,480
And don't do anything to Mrs. Huo.

692
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,280
No one is allowed to interrogate without my permission.

693
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,440
Yes.

694
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,120
That's the case.

695
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,800
Mrs. Huo and Li Xiao

696
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,600
are not the killers of General Huo.

697
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,960
Who else could be the killers?

698
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:52,920
Tong Shuang.

699
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,440
I found out that

700
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,440
General Huo has been living alone

701
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,000
in the study for half a year.

702
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,680
It's the same as the result of the interrogation.

703
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,880
General Huo has been living in the study

704
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,920
because he found out the relationship between Mrs. Huo and Li Xiao.

705
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,760
General Huo has been asking Mrs. Feng to accompany him for half a year.

706
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,240
He thought of the good of the concubine

707
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,840
because his newly married wife was a thief.

708
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,360
It's also in the love.

709
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,120
Mrs. Feng said

710
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,480
she had a good relationship with General Huo.

711
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,480
Yes, she did.

712
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,640
The butler also said

713
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,000
General Huo loved tea.

714
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,120
For General Huo,

715
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,320
Mrs. Feng specially visited the folk doctor

716
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,520
and learned a health tea.

717
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,840
She made tea for him every day.

718
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,120
General Huo liked it very much.

719
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,560
The butler also said

720
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,360
General Huo didn't smile before.

721
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,600
But as soon as he drank tea, he had a crack in his mouth.

722
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,240
Mrs. Feng.

723
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,040
Mrs. Feng didn't kill anyone.

724
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,440
The key to the problem is not Mrs. Feng,

725
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,080
but Huo Dairong.

726
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,920
Miss Huo?

727
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,440
What's wrong with her?

728
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,280
The reason why we suspect Mrs. Huo and Li Xiao

729
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,480
is not empty-blooded.

730
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,120
Since we interviewed the Huo family,

731
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,400
Huo Dairong has deliberately

732
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,520
pointed out our investigation direction

733
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,640
to them.

734
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,360
If it wasn't for that divorce letter,

735
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,960
he would have used the poison powder on the tonic

736
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,440
to make up for their love.

737
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,120
Without any other evidence,

738
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,960
he could have admitted that they were the killers.

739
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,160
What's wrong, sister?

740
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,160
Huo Dairong found out about your identity

741
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,400
and didn't expose you.

742
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,000
Is he also using you

743
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,080
to get your hand

744
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,000
to get rid of Mrs. Huo and Li Xiao's love?

745
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,120
No.

746
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,280
No, are you thinking too much?

747
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,160
Miss Huo is from her perspective.

748
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,280
Everything is reasonable.

749
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,280
She found out about Mrs. Huo and Li Xiao's private life.

750
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,520
Her father died of an accident.

751
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,880
What's wrong with her trying to

752
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,040
make them a couple?

753
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,320
Besides, she didn't have any motive to kill.

754
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,480
Whether she had any motive,

755
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,240
Mrs. Huo has already taken the law.

756
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,520
The most powerful person in the whole Huo family

757
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,000
is Huo Dairong's mother.

758
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,280
This is the truth.

759
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,960
Speaking of motive,

760
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,320
I have a new discovery.

761
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,640
The Sea's Trouble?

762
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,800
The Sea's Trouble?

763
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,240
Where did you find this?

764
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,240
General Huo's study.

765
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,840
It seems that General Huo

766
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,520
is indeed involved in the Sea's Trouble.

767
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,760
Did Mrs. Huo say

768
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,200
that General Huo has no ability to survive?

769
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:05,880
That's right.

770
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,320
It's said that it's a mark left by him

771
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,640
when he was young on the battlefield.

772
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,720
Madam Feng said that

773
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,560
General Huo was arrested on his return from the battlefield.

774
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,920
It was 23 years ago.

775
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,520
If General Huo had not been able to survive

776
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,040
before he went to the battlefield,

777
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,360
then he would have been killed.

778
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,240
It's said that

779
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,400
General Huo was killed

780
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,480
when he was young.

781
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,480
It's said that

782
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,480
General Huo was killed

783
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,560
when he was young.

784
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,040
So, he couldn't survive.

785
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,000
You mean

786
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,360
Huo Dai Rong

787
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,000
may not be General Huo's biological daughter?

788
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,520
Miss Huo is not biological.

789
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,760
How is that possible?

790
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,920
How could she hide it from General Huo?

791
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,200
With General Huo's temper,

792
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,720
how could she let them

793
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,200
live in the mansion for so long?

794
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,960
What if she has a reason to keep it?

795
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,120
What reason?

796
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,720
What year was it 23 years ago?

797
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,400
The year of the 36th year of the Ming Dynasty.

798
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,880
There must be a reason

799
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,480
for them to argue about it.

800
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,240
The 36th year of the Ming Dynasty.

801
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,560
The 36th year of the Ming Dynasty.

802
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,760
The 36th year of the Ming Dynasty.

803
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,320
The 36th year of the Ming Dynasty.

804
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,560
The Ocean.

805
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,760
If Huo Dai Rong

806
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,040
is really related to the Ocean,

807
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,080
then General Huo

808
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,040
may also hide it.

809
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,480
Wait.

810
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,600
So, Huo Dai Rong may be...

811
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,600
The orphan of the Ocean.

812
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,400
In fact, every survivor of the Ocean

813
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,480
is a child.

814
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,920
As long as there is one survivor

815
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,200
and one breath,

816
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,440
Yasha will appear without any hesitation.

817
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:17,800
The motive of the murderer

818
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,880
is clear.

819
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,040
So, this case

820
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,920
has nothing to do with Yasha.

821
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,440
We didn't have any solid evidence just now.

822
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,200
What if it's the emergency

823
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,640
that General Huo left

824
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,240
after he gave birth to Huo Dai Rong?

825
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,240
Then all the speculations just now

826
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,360
are wrong.

827
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,080
Yes.

828
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,400
So, all we are doing now

829
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,520
is speculating.

830
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,880
But whether we are investigating the Ocean

831
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,440
or the death of General Huo,

832
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,280
we can't get away from Huo Dai Rong's mother.

833
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,080
Miss Huo doesn't look like a bad person.

834
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,640
She knows people, faces and doesn't know her heart.

835
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,840
You are a stupid person.

836
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,200
You are easily fooled by women.

837
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,720
We have to go to the Huo Mansion now.

838
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,080
Everyone, get ready.

839
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,200
Why are we going there this time?

840
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,160
Let's go to see a doctor.

841
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,640
The blood vessel of the mother can't tolerate meridians.

842
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,520
It causes the blood pressure.

843
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,960
If you don't take good care of yourself,

844
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,480
I'm afraid that...

845
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:33,360
I know my body well.

846
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,680
I'll just say it.

847
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,800
I'm afraid that you'll be paralyzed.

848
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,280
Mr. Feng, please save my mother.

849
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,600
As long as you can save my mother,

850
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,120
I'm willing to do anything.

851
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:52,720
Rong'er.

852
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,480
Miss Huo, please get up.

853
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:55,920
Miss Huo,

854
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,840
I'll do my best to save the lives of the people.

855
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,480
Thank you, Mr. Feng.

856
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,120
Miss Huo,

857
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,920
I need a quiet place

858
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,240
to prescribe medicine for the mother.

859
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:10,680
Okay.

860
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,320
Please come with me, Mr. Feng.

861
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,680
Goodbye.

862
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,120
Goodbye.

863
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,080
Thank you.

864
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,920
Don't mention it.

865
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,840
I'm younger than you.

866
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,560
I'm a friend of Miss Huo.

867
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,160
It's a great fortune for Rong'er

868
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,480
to have a friend like you.

869
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,320
I'm sorry.

870
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,640
Mr. Zhong,

871
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,720
do you have something to ask me?

872
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,760
I'm here today

873
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,200
to ask you something.

874
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,640
Go ahead.

875
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,280
I'll be straightforward.

876
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,600
Miss Huo

877
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,360
is not the child of you and General Huo, right?

878
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,320
I'm sorry.

879
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,200
I'm sorry.

880
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,120
I'm sorry.

881
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,120
I'm sorry.

882
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,120
I'm sorry.

883
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,120
I'm sorry.

884
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,120
I'm sorry.

885
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,120
I'm sorry.

886
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,120
I'm sorry.

887
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,120
I'm sorry.

888
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,120
I'm sorry.

889
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,120
I'm sorry.

890
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,120
I'm sorry.

891
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,120
I'm sorry.

892
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,120
I'm sorry.

893
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,120
I'm sorry.

894
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,120
I'm sorry.

895
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,120
I'm sorry.

896
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,120
I'm sorry.

897
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,120
I'm sorry.

898
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,120
I'm sorry.

899
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,120
I'm sorry.

900
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,120
I'm sorry.

901
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,120
I'm sorry.

902
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,120
I'm sorry.

903
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,120
I'm sorry.

904
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,120
I'm sorry.

905
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,120
I'm sorry.

906
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,120
I'm sorry.

907
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,120
I'm sorry.

908
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,280
I'm so sorry.

909
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,280
I'm sorry.

910
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,280
I'm sorry.

911
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,280
I'm sorry.

912
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,280
I'm so sorry.

913
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,280
I'm sorry.

914
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,280
I'm so sorry.

915
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,280
I'm sorry.

916
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,280
I'm sorry.

917
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,280
I'm sorry.

918
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,280
I'm sorry.

919
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,280
I'm so sorry.

920
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,280
I'm so sorry.

921
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,280
I'm so sorry.

922
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:01,400
I can only

923
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,400
forgive myself.

924
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,360
Marry her again.

925
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,860
Marry her.

926
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,740
Let her not us to hate each other .

927
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:13,620
She looks like a red therapist.
