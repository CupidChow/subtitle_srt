Because there is no such person.

didn't have any outward-tearing flesh.

Yet the flesh atop the head

239

was torn and turned outward.

but someone disguised it as a throat slit.

There was a knife at the scene,

but there were no blood stains
at the point of impact.

Stop arguing.

346
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,280
What matters most now

347
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,140
is to solve this case quickly.

348
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,670
I actually have a suggestion.

349
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,630
Let the Secret Investigation Unit
and the Elite Constabulary Unit

350
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,790
jointly investigate the case.

351
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,200
What do you think?

352
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,080
Your Majesty,
I don't think it's advisable.

353
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,630
With too many people involved,

354
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,150
we might alert the culprit.

355
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,150
The Secret Investigation Unit
is willing to take the case alone.

356
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,480
Just give us one month,

357
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,000
and we will surely solve it.

358
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,480
With a killer like Yesha,

359
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,390
one month from now, who knows how many of

360
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,030
my trusted ministers will still be alive?

361

Ten days.

Three days.

I've heard of your deeds.

00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,270
Lately,

375

you've unraveled
case after case of great mystery.

377
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,610
of great value to the Qi Kingdom.

378
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,720
However,

379
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,270
is a three-day time limit

380
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,630
not rather

381
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,110
too rash a decision?

382
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,910
I'm not being rash, Your Majesty.

383
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,270
It's just that in three days,

384
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,390
I have a wedding.

385
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,790
I cannot afford any delays.

386
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,390
Thus,

387
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,630
I shall need no more than three days

388
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,830
to uncover the truth.

389

This case is definitely
more complicated than it appears.

402

Three days

403

in Sea Cliff all those years ago...

I dare not.

We, the Elite Constabulary Unit,

420
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,550

00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:17,440
in front of Master?

516
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,530
You weren't allowed to investigate

517
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:19,830
because we're worried about your safety.

518
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:20,920
I'm sending you back.

519
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,650
Don't use my dad to pressure me.

520
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,930
You promised me.

521
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,780
After we're married,

522
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,310
you'd let me investigate cases with you.

523
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:26,970
So what now?

524
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,400
Going back on your word?

525
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:28,880
I...

526
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,310
Xueman.

527
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:36,550
Stop messing around.

528
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,950
Come down. Let's go home.

529
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,040
Even you think I'm messing around.

530
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:42,790
I...

531
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,880
You know full well

532
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,680
how hard I've worked these past years

533
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,940
to become a constable.

534
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,270
Passing the assessment

535
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,510
wasn't easy for me.

536
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,110
I thought I could finally
put my skills to use,

537
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,710
solve cases and help people.

538
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,280
But just because I'm a girl,

539
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,310
all of you are coddling me

540
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,240
and won't let me investigate the cases.

541
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,380
Some even gossip behind my back,

542
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,190
saying I only became a constable

543
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,680
because my father
is the King of Constables.

544
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,440
Xueman,

545
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,680
we stop you from investigating

546
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,880
because we're afraid you'll get hurt.

547
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,300
As for what outsiders say—

548
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:04,960
Outsiders?

549
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,790
I don't care about their opinions.

550
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,110
This is something I need to do.

551
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:10,770
If even you think

552
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:11,900
I'm messing around,

553
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,070
and you won't take me along—

554
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:13,440
I...

555
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,790
I'll figure it out myself.

556
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,160
I want the world to know

557
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,200
that even a woman

558
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,930
can become

559
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,110
an outstanding constable.

560
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,210
You definitely

561
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,120
can.

562
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,540
I've never doubted that.

563
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,510
It's just that this case is too unusual.

564
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,780
Yesha is extremely dangerous.

565
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,910
You saw it yourself.

566
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,070
Come on.

567
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,830
Xueman.

568
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,510
Alright.

569
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,260
I was wrong.

570
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,310
I'll take you with me
to investigate, alright?

571
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,400
Now wipe those tears.

572
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,460
What kind of constable cries

573
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,240
on the job?

574
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,350
Gotcha!

575
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,350
You promised me.

576
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,050
It's a deal.

577
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:53,930
No backing out.

578
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,750
Zhong Xueman.

579
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,510
You...

580
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,340
Where are the blood tears?

581
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,950
Someone wiped them away.

582
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,160
Now how are we supposed to investigate?

583
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,430
Every crime has a motive.

584
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,480
There's definitely more to this
than it seems.

585
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,800
Do you believe in ghosts?

586
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,920
My dad said,

587
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,480
tales of spirits and monsters
can't be trusted.

588
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,750
All the strange things in the world
come from what's in people's hearts.

589
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,440
Exactly.

590
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,470
Every crime has a motive.

591
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,240
Do you know what "Yesha"

592
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:29,960
means?

593
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,350
There's a folk tale that goes:

594
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,070
When someone dies
harboring deep resentment,

595
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,960
their soul cannot find rest
or reincarnate.

596
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,680
Instead, they become a vengeful spirit,
trapped among the living.

597
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,600
When that hatred
runs as deep as the ocean,

598
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,590
and their wrath fills the very heavens,

599
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,440
they are called Yesha.

600
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,030
It's said that Yesha claims lives

601
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,430
without leaving a trace.

602
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,030
Beiming,

603
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,340
you're better at solving cases

604
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,270
than I am,

605
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,720
but when it comes to popular stories
and legends,

606
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,110
I've read way more than you.

607
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:50,830
Besides,

608
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,810
Yesha killed several officials

609
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,200
but didn't take any valuables.

610
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,460
So it wasn't for money,

611
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,640
but for revenge.

612
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,000
Am I right?

613
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,070
Partially.

614
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,480
I think everything Yesha

615
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,440
has done so far

616
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,960
was to spread rumors.

617
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,000
If it were just for revenge,

618
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,500
there was no need

619
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,920
to tamper with the statue.

620
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,550
He wants everyone to believe

621
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,590
that Yesha has come,

622
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,200
and the fall of the Qi Kingdom is near.

623
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,600
This person's ambitions

624
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,190
go far beyond

625
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:14,920
a few lives.

626
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,400
But he caused such a big mess.

627
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:19,410
Isn't he afraid that if he fails,

628
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,900
he'll fall into our hands?

629
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,130
Yesha prides himself on his cleverness,

630
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:25,030
thinking he's planned every move.

631
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,040
But there's one thing

632
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,300
he didn't account for.

633
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,160
What's that?

634
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,550
Me.

635
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,960
So is it him that's arrogant,

636
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,340
or you?

637
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,310
Don't worry.

638
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,590
I'll outwit him.

639
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:44,680
Let's go.

640
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,460
Go where?

641
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,480
It's already dark.

642
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,480
Home, of course.

643
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,920
But we haven't found anything yet.

644
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,600
Even so, we need some rest.

645
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,740
Tomorrow morning,

646
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,000
we'll head to Mandarin Duck Restaurant.

647
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,200
For what?

648
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:58,830
Is there a case
at Mandarin Duck Restaurant too?

649
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,000
We're going there

650
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,480
to get someone her favorite treat,

651
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:04,140
the very first batch of
peach blossom pastries.

652
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,110
Xueman.

653
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:45,960
Forceps.

654
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,640
Catch it.

655
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,670
[Yesha]

656
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,600
Mr. Shen,

657
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,680
even though you've been reassigned,

658
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:20,540
[Shen Mansion]

659
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,960
your safety must come first.

660
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,200
Please report to His Majesty

661
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,070
and stay in the capital for now.

662
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,480
Ridiculous!

663
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,590
If Yesha really wants to kill me,

664
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,400
how long can you guard me for?

665
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,200
One year?

666
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,200
Or ten years?

667
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,480
Am I to live

668
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,710
my entire life

669
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,240
under your watch,

670
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,440
like one of

671
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,160
your prisoners?

672
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,110
Enough.

673
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,400
I am willing to devote my remaining years

674
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,800
to the good of the nation.

675
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,160
Tomorrow morning,

676
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,770
I must leave for my new post.

677
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:46,750
Mr. Shen.

678
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,750
Master.

679
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,680
Mr. Shen is right.

680
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:50,870
Keeping him here

681
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,200
won't change anything.

682
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:52,890
Beiming.

683
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:53,590
Master,

684
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,720
I have a plan

685
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,810
that can ensure Mr. Shen's safety.

686
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,310
Xiao Beiming ran

687
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,670
all over the city today,

688
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,310
but it was all just a blur.

689
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,640
What useful leads could he possibly find?

690
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,880
Even though His Majesty

691
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,160
assigned this case
to the Elite Constabulary Unit,

692
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,550
we of the Secret Investigation Unit

693
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,270
must not stand idly by.

694
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,220
For years,

695
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,270
the Elite Constabulary Unit

696
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,920
has been outshining us.

697
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,800
If they crack this case,

698
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:25,030
our future

699
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,720
will be even bleaker.

700
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,000
You're right, Father.

701
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:32,210
This case is of great importance.

702
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,270
If we can solve it

703
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:35,240
before Xiao Beiming does,

704
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,640
His Majesty will surely reward us,

705
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,790
not punish us.

706
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,640
It's a golden opportunity.

707
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,650
We must seize it.

708
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,520
But since the case

709
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,730
has already been handed over
to the Elite Constabulary Unit,

710
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:47,800
we can't

711
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,630
conduct an open investigation.

712
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,540
So how are we supposed to gather clues?

713
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,440
Why did you support

714
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:06,100
[Shen Mansion]

715
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,440
Mr. Shen's departure from the capital?

716
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,230
Once he's gone,

717
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,400
we won't be able to protect him.

718
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,650
Tomorrow is the third day.

719
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:03,520
If something happens,

720
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,650
we'll be in trouble.

721
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,920
Of course I know that.

722
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,880
Then you…
So you need to find Master as soon as possible

723
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,640
and stay at the Shen Mansion with them

724
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,160
to ensure Mr. Shen's safety.

725
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,310
Are you hiding something

726
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:12,790
from me?

727
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:13,730
Of course not.

728
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,830
By the way, Xueman,

729
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,360
do you have any money on you?

730
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,910
Since you're not telling me anything,

731
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:18,550
I won't give you any money.

732
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,060
It's not that I'm hiding it.

733
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,070
The time just isn't right yet.

734
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,390
I have something important to do,

735
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:24,370
and I'll explain everything
once I'm back, okay?

736
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:24,920
Beiming.

737
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:28,520
[Shen Mansion]

738
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,550
Fang Yin's in trouble at the gambling den.

739
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,810
Xueman, I really have to go.

740
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,070
I'll talk to you later.

741
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:32,620
Wait...

742
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,550
[Shen Mansion]

743
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,270
Money!

744
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,510
Don't move.

745
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,350
I will pay you back!

746
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,740
I swear in the name of

747
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:47,030
the Elite Constabulary Unit.

748
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,310
Let me go.

749
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,000
Your savior's here.

750
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,030
Beiming!

751
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,550
Beiming, help me!

752
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,510
Zhuge is going to chop off my finger!

753
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,430
Spill it.

754
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,850
What scheme are you playing this time?

755
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,250
Your junior bet against me

756
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,310
and lost 500 taels.

757
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,960
Now he says he doesn't have the money.

758
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,760
By the rules of the gambling den,

759
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,530
he's got to chop off five fingers

760
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:15,530
to pay his debt.

761
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,920
Beiming.

762
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,350
Don't believe him!

763
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,440
He set me up!

764
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,670
I told you not to move!

765
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,000
Five hundred taels?

766
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,720
Even if I sold
all of the Elite Constabulary Unit's land,

767
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,400
I still couldn't pay that back.

768
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,790
Five fingers for 500 taels?

769
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,360
That's a fair trade.

770
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,440
Chop them off.

771
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,340
Xiao Beiming.

772
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,950
How could you say that?

773
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,270
My uncle is the deputy chief
of the Elite Constabulary Unit.

774
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,480
If you stand by and do nothing,

775
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,970
he won't let you off!

776
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,680
What kind of nonsense is that?

777
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,300
You walked right into

778
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,690
a trap yourself.

779
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,540
How could your uncle

780
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,920
blame me for that?

781
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:46,000
Besides,

782
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,480
that's 500 taels.

783
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,920
Five fingers?

784
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,650
That's a bargain.

785
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,920
If I were Mr. Zhuge,

786
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,540
I'd take all ten.

787
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,590
Beiming,

788
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,800
he is our colleague.

789
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,240
Please help him out.

790
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,510
Senior.

791
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,790
This bastard

792
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:04,270
always uses his uncle's position

793
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,090
to cause us

794
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:05,830
trouble.

795
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,720
If he loses his hand,

796
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,270
he can't be a constable anymore.

797
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,750
That would save us a lot of headaches

798
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,000
when solving cases.

799
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,270
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

800
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,290
Xiao Beiming,

801
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,920
you're heartless!

802
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,740
Gag him and chop his fingers off.

803
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,680
Don't...

804
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,350
Don't...

805
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,720
I didn't do anything!

806
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,920
Coward.

807
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:32,740
Mr. Zhuge,

808
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,160
what does that mean?

809
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,730
Is this a great act of mercy?

810
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,200
You're just using me
to eliminate your rival.

811
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,770
I won't fall for that.

812
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,350
Come on,

813
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,400
your grudge

814
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,720
is with him.

815
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,550
What does that have to do with me?

816
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:51,470
Alright, let's drop the act.

817
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,400
You knew I was using him

818
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,930
to lure you out.

819
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:55,480
Since I'm clearly the target,

820
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,830
let's not beat around the bush.

821
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:57,470
Let's settle this today

822
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,670
once and for all.

823
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,000
And don't you dare

824
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,860
touch my fellow disciples again.

825
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,510
As long as you cooperate.

826
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Deal.

827
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:15,350
If you ever step into
the gambling den again,

828
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,830
I'll break your legs.

829
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,590
G-Got it.

830
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,590
I won't do it again.

831
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,420
Send him back.

832
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,640
Let's go.

833
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,200
You...

834
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:28,770
[Gambling]

835
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,550
Alright,

836
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,480
now it's just the two of us.

837
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,350
Let's make a bet.

838
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,200
How?

839
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,200
It's simple.

840
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,370
Highest roll wins.

841
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,880
If you lose,

842
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,270
you give me all the clues you have

843
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,270
on the Yesha case.

844
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,030
So straightforward?

845
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,160
Schemes are boring

846
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,160
against someone like you.

847
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,880
Let's keep it direct.

848
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,270
But what if you lose?

849
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,030
Are these enough?

850
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,590
What do you think?

851
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,200
Just a little wager.

852
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,590
If I dared to invite you into my game,

853
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,110
then I'm ready to accept your stakes too.

854
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:06,440
I'm just worried you can't handle losing.

855
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,270
You've known me for years.

856
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,100
Have you ever seen me lose?

857
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,680
Then what's your stake?

858
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,110

00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:15,660
Beiming,

1031
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,320
we're about to leave the city.

1032
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,280
Be careful.

1033
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,740
The real danger starts once we're outside.

1034
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,400
Got it.

1035
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,530
Mr. Shen.

1036
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:29,400
Mr. Shen!

1037
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,920
Mr. Shen!

1038
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,400
Mr. Shen!

1039
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,770
What happened?

1040
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:40,920
Just now, amid the confusion,

1041
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,170
someone shot a steel needle

1042
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,530
through the window,

1043
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:45,450
piercing Mr. Shen's vital point.

1044
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,780
He died instantly, without a sound.

1045
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,020
Yesha is a true master of hidden weapons.

1046
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,320
Xiao Beiming,

1047
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,400
you lost the bet this time.
