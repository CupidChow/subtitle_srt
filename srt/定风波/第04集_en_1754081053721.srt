00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,320
I'm not afraid of anything.

109
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,320
Come.

110
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,640
I thought I would disappear,

111
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,800
哈哈

112
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,120
If you have to say this I think

113
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,080
You don't need to think it

114
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,960
I don't know what you are doing.

115
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,440
Do you know what you are doing?

116
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,600
Why do you look at me?

117
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,240
Are you the coroner of Shen Buying?

118
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,600
My last name is Feng.

119
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,480
I'm Feng Qingzhuo.

120
00:03:59,240 --> 00:03:59,960
I didn't see you

121
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,680
when I was in Shen Buying.

122
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,200
I just got in the company for more than a year.

123
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,080
But I heard you...

124
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,040
You are the enemy.

125
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,480
Shen Buying was killed

126
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,240
because of you.

127
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,120
The person who caused the fire.

128
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,280
Plus the case in the western suburb tonight,

129
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,840
it's the fourth murder case

130
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,200
in recent times.

131
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,560
You not only hide it from us,

132
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,720
but also deliberately burn the body

133
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,680
and cover up the evidence.

134
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,040
Why is that?

135
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,800
How do you know

136
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,880
that Feng's case was involved?

137
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,200
Of course I found it out.

138
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,680
If you don't explain the case to me,

139
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,400
I will report the case to the Ministry of Justice.

140
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,440
Recently, all the big cases in Beijing

141
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,800
are handled by the investigation team.

142
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,120
If the investigation team accepts it,

143
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,520
what will happen then?

144
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,800
Chief, I don't know either.

145
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,480
The poison on me

146
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,920
was given by you to my sister.

147
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,760
Yes, I gave it to her.

148
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,680
So what?

149
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,320
You are the wanted criminal of Tianzi.

150
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,520
Even if I gave the wrong medicine,

151
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,800
even if I poisoned you to death,

152
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,080
they won't blame me.

153
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,720
I just want to know

154
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,400
what poison I was poisoned with.

155
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,000
The poison you were poisoned with is called Ningxue Han.

156
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Ningxue Han?

157
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,160
My master developed it.

158
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,880
After this poison enters the body,

159
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,920
it will clean up your organs and meridians,

160
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,960
and your internal force will be completely gone.

161
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,320
Finally, the meridians will die of coldness.

162
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,680
I really can't feel my internal force.

163
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,280
Little White Dragon.

164
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
What Little White Dragon?

165
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,600
Are you talking to me?

166
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,160
Little White Dragon of the Poisonous Valley.

167
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,760
Your name?

168
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,040
What?

169
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,760
Okay.

170
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,800
Let me tell you a story.

171
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,320
There is a evil sect in the world

172
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,520
called Poisonous Valley.

173
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,240
There are 90% of the poisonous things in the world

174
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,240
come from this valley.

175
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,560
The two male soldiers in the valley

176
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,680
are your master,

177
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,760
Wushuang Lao Ren,

178
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,320
and Lao Chou Chong.

179
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
But a few years ago,

180
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,320
Wushuang Lao Ren died.

181
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,040
Lao Chou Chong disappeared.

182
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,000
Poisonous Valley is divided into five groups.

183
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,600
The disciples are wandering in the world.

184
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,360
And there are countless people who have been killed in the past.

185
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,560
The evil temple is full.

186
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,560
Everyone in the world is killed.

187
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,440
Do you understand?

188
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,360
Why are you telling me this?

189
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,440
Can you show me the needle you are suspecting?

190
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,000
Why should I show it to you?

191
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,200
You are a fool.

192
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,240
I was ordered by Lieutenant Zhong

193
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,600
to suppress you here.

194
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,360
When you gave me the needle,

195
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,480
I woke up several times.

196
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,080
Your needlework is very special.

197
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,560
I saw it on the disciples of Poisonous Valley.

198
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,280
You are not using ordinary needles.

199
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,960
Instead, you are using the Golden Needle of the Phoenix.

200
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The Golden Needle of the Phoenix.

201
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,280
And the one who uses the Golden Needle of the Phoenix

202
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,600
in Poisonous Valley is the owner,

203
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,760
Wushuang Lao Ren.

204
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,880
I heard that Wushuang Lao Ren has a disciple

205
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,200
named Xiao Bailong.

206
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,120
If I guess it right,

207
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,520
you are using

208
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,800
your master's needle.

209
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,360
You secretly hid your name

210
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,880
and got into the God's Camp

211
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,200
just to avoid the pursuit of the underworld.

212
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,920
And

213
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,880
you don't want others

214
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,760
to know your identity, do you?

215
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,720
Yes.

216
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,640
What?

217
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,600
Are you threatening me?

218
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,160
I just want to make a deal with you.

219
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,480
Since you found out my identity,

220
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,080
your martial arts are all lost.

221
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,440
I will kill you in reverse.

222
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,720
Forget it.

223
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,120
You've learned so much about the case.

224
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,400
You must also know that

225
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,760
these four people were killed

226
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,440
by Ye Sha and Xiao Beiming, right?

227
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,960
No matter who the murderer is,

228
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,560
it shouldn't be the case that everyone is to blame.

229
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,520
Let me ask you.

230
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,520
If I don't blame them,

231
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,840
how should this case be handled?

232
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,240
Ye Sha re-entered the martial arts world.

233
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,000
The court is both internal and external.

234
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,240
People are in a panic.

235
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,840
Feng Bo Hu has been in the case for three years.

236
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,280
The police have been investigating for three years.

237
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,240
They have nothing to do with it.

238
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,240
What kind of person is Xiao Beiming?

239
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,520
What kind of ability does he have?

240
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,200
You're more knowledgeable than anyone, right?

241
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,280
Zhu Getong and his father couldn't be caught for three years.

242
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,480
We can catch them.

243
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,040
I destroyed the body-destructing machine

244
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,320
for another reason.

245
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,040
It's because of you.

246
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,800
Me?

247
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,760
Xiao Beiming used to be your husband

248
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,240
and your enemy.

249
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,720
Now he's the most dangerous person in the world.

250
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,680
I know you've been investigating for three years.

251
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,080
It's useless to persuade anyone.

252
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,000
Fortunately, the ghosts in the martial arts world

253
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,120
let you know that you can still be safe today.

254
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,400
If you really know now that he's here,

255
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,320
I won't say anything about your reckless character.

256
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,800
When you really face him,

257
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,200
can you guarantee that you will be safe?

258
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,560
Your father was kind to me back then.

259
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,400
I will keep you safe no matter what.

260
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,480
Chief, I'm a bailiff.

261
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,960
Even if I die on the way to the crime scene,

262
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,880
I have to pay back for the uniform on me

263
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,320
and my father.

264
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,040
His reputation.

265
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,880
I'm really curious about you.

266
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,160
You know I'm a drug dealer.

267
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,600
You saw me being poisoned,

268
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,360
but you still tried to save me.

269
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,400
The pills you gave me are all valuable.

270
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,760
Because I gave you the wrong medicine.

271
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,400
I will definitely save you.

272
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,520
That's all.

273
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,560
Although you're a drug dealer,

274
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,280
you haven't been sentenced to death.

275
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm a doctor.

276
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,120
You fell down before you died.

277
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,240
I will definitely save you.

278
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,400
I will save you with all my heart.

279
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,440
I'm a doctor.

280
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,560
A doctor?

281
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,400
It's not the same as your reputation in the martial arts world.

282
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,400
That's the old bug spreading rumors and slandering me.

283
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,320
It's not good for my master and me.

284
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,520
It can't see me well.

285
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,440
All these years,

286
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,400
I didn't kill anyone.

287
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,040
I was wronged to death.

288
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,800
What kind of person are you?

289
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,480
You saw it.

290
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,880
I dare not kill a chicken.

291
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,320
Not to mention killing people.

292
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,880
What about the poison on you?

293
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,040
My master told me

294
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,800
there are two types of poison.

295
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,280
It can harm people

296
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,680
and save people.

297
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,520
So you chose the latter.

298
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,680
What kind of deal do you want to make with me?

299
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,360
Chief.

300
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,440
I've said everything here.

301
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,800
Why can't you understand?

302
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,960
Even if I let you investigate this case,

303
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,320
can you solve the case?

304
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,840
You can't solve the case.

305
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,240
If you know everything,

306
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,440
what about Shen Bing?

307
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,400
This time it's different.

308
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,440
The clues are clear.

309
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,480
I'm confident I can solve the case.

310
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,360
What clues?

311
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,240
What are you doing?

312
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,720
Although the usual case is different,

313
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,640
the court officials are the ones who are targeted.

314
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,160
This time,

315
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,680
it's the woman from the brothel.

316
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,200
How do you know

317
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,480
the victim is the woman from the brothel?

318
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,920
According to the law,

319
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,960
the criminal is stabbed,

320
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,080
the soldier is stabbed,

321
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,840
and the woman from the brothel is stabbed.

322
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,280
The fourth body

323
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,720
has the word of the woman from the brothel.

324
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,720
Zhu Bukai just said a knife.

325
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,240
That means the four bodies

326
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,600
are all women from the brothel.

327
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,080
Senior Jiang.

328
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,480
Before the three bodies were burned,

329
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,800
were there the words of the woman from the brothel?

330
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,760
Yes.

331
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,920
The four women were all cut-off.

332
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,280
But before they died,

333
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,960
they were all wearing the bride's wedding dress.

334
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,960
That means they were all familiar.

335
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,600
But why would Ye Sha

336
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,360
kill such a low-class woman?

337
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,640
That's why we need to investigate.

338
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,880
We need to start from the identity of the victim.

339
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,720
As long as we find out the murderer's motive,

340
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,400
what's the connection with these women?

341
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,000
We can find him

342
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,440
by the way.

343
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,640
As long as we find him,

344
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,960
the truth will come out.

345
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,400
We found him.

346
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,960
What are you doing, guys?

347
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,560
I just want to find out the truth

348
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,680
and catch the murderer.

349
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,520
I want to be the first to do it.

350
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,640
take care of ourselves,

351
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,900
and go.

352
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,820
You, too.

353
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,000
This matter

354
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,480
is a matter of life and death.

355
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,080
We are more important for the sake of our country.

356
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,360
We have a shot-at-that.

357
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,240
That's my personal opinion

358
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,820
and this matter is of no concern.

359
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,800
What My Lord is saying.

360
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,160
There are still a lot of things

361
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,580
that needs to be addressed.

362
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,420
Do you know the art ofappropriy,

363
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:16,620
If you follow down this Japanese then you will settle down.

364
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,600
Good.

365
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,620
You're a woman after all.

366
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,100
Let's investigate this place.

367
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,100
To be honest,

368
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,500
it's been so sad these three years.

369
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,900
Mo Chong was transferred to the medical school.

370
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,780
And Liu Feng and I

371
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,100
don't have any cases.

372
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,820
I really want to do something for you.

373
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,580
Don't worry.

374
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,540
As long as I find out the clues,

375
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,820
I'll tell you right away.

376
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,860
Okay.

377
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,060
Thank you, Senior Jiang.

378
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,340
This is...

379
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,260
Have you seen this person?

380
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,100
Have you seen him?

381
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:06,740
No.

382
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,700
No.

383
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,780
Who are you looking for?

384
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,700
I haven't seen him.

385
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,260
Have you seen him?

386
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,220
No.

387
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,380
I don't remember.

388
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,100
I don't know him.

389
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,500
I don't remember.

390
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,300
I haven't seen him.

391
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,380
I don't remember.

392
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,700
What is this?

393
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,700
Why is it so dark?

394
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,860
I can help you keep

395
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,540
the secret of your old and young White Dragon.

396
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,060
But I hope

397
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,940
you can help me keep

398
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,620
the secret of me by Zhong Bu Huai.

399
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:35,900
Okay.

400
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,780
And

401
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,220
I hope you can stay

402
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,540
and help me and Zhong Bu Huai.

403
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,540
You saw it just now.

404
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,860
Zhong Bu Huai doesn't believe me.

405
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,460
My identity is so special.

406
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,060
You are good at medicine,

407
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:46,740
poison,

408
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,220
and the guidance of the autopsy.

409
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,740
With you by our side,

410
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,140
you can do many things.

411
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,140
I don't understand.

412
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,620
Aren't you Zhong Bu Huai's

413
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,780
killer enemy?

414
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,140
You're a night killer.

415
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,820
Why do you care so much about him?

416
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,940
Everyone thinks

417
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,860
you're the only White Dragon

418
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,140
who uses poison to kill people.

419
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,420
But only you know

420
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,260
you're just a doctor

421
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,100
who can't bear to see death.

422
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,620
Everyone in the world thinks I'm a night killer.

423
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,900
But only I know

424
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:17,900
I'm just a

425
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,620
spy who wants to find out the truth.

426
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,260
I don't need you to say it.

427
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,060
I'll help Zhong Bu Huai.

428
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:25,900
Why?

429
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,660
Because he saved my life.

430
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,940
Zhong Bu Huai saved my life.

431
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,740
So you don't need to say it.

432
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,740
I'll help him.

433
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,300
Then the identity of the only White Dragon

434
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,820
you don't plan to tell him?

435
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,780
Absolutely not.

436
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,140
You think he's already dead?

437
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,780
I'm a doctor.

438
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,940
I'll help him.

439
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,740
I'll help you.

440
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,820
I'll help you.

441
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,060
I'll help you.

442
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,300
I'll help you.

443
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,820
I'll help you.

444
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,020
I'll help you.

445
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,060
I'll help you.

446
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,620
I'll help you.

447
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,700
I'll help you.

448
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,900
I'm the coroner of the Shenmu Camp, Feng Qingzhu.

449
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,220
Then we're done.

450
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,100
Done?

451
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,100
Officer Zhong, you're finally back.

452
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,420
Don't worry.

453
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,820
He's dead.

454
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,820
Cai Feng has a plan again.

455
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,140
You're not hurt, are you?

456
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,860
You saw it too.

457
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,740
I was locked here.

458
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,180
The coroner kept watching me.

459
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,180
Now you should believe

460
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,180
I'm not the murderer of this murder.

461
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,580
You said it yourself.

462
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,060
Ye Sha might not be alone.

463
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,340
Maybe you have a helper.

464
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,340
Before the crime is exposed,

465
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,380
you still can't get rid of the suspect.

466
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,900
As long as we keep investigating,

467
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,460
the truth will come to light.

468
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,660
I'll keep investigating.

469
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:06,860
Officer Zhong,

470
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,500
do I have to continue to investigate?

471
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,340
The girl who died was Ruolan.

472
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,780
She used to stay in Xingchun Restaurant.

473
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,420
A man named Hu Shisan

474
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,420
sold her in there.

475
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,580
Hu Shisan?

476
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,180
Yes.

477
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,500
She's a famous maid in the capital.

478
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,820
Not only in Xingchun Restaurant,

479
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,580
but also many women in the capital

480
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,780
were taken out by the police.

481
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,620
There must be something wrong with her.

482
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,300
Why do you think she's the problem?

483
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:29,900
Look.

484
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,980
The maid only sells.

485
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,700
Ruolan was bought back

486
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,780
by Hu Shisan

487
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,980
half a month ago.

488
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,820
Bought back?

489
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,860
Isn't it strange?

490
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,620
Oh, and I heard

491
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,220
that she gave more money

492
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,260
than she sold

493
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,940
to the acquaintance.

494
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,340
It's strange.

495
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,100
Where is Hu Shisan now?

496
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,580
East Street, 3rd Street.

497
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:49,740
The third yard.

498
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,380
Stop hitting me.

499
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,860
Your boss is Hu Shisan, right?

500
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,260
Yes.

501
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,300
Where is he now?

502
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,260
Our boss is missing.

503
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,460
I don't know where he is.

504
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,740
We're looking for him, too.

505
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,660
Missing?

506
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,060
When?

507
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,100
It's been more than ten days.

508
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,820
We've searched the whole city

509
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,060
but we didn't find him.

510
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,180
Do you know this woman?

511
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:34,940
Yes.

512
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,100
She was bought back

513
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,380
by our boss in Xingchun Restaurant.

514
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,860
And then she was bought back?

515
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,780
Impossible.

516
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:40,940
How can she sell

517
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,180
and buy back?

518
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,460
Think again.

519
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,340
Stop hitting me.

520
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,940
Mrs. Gu.

521
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,820
I'm telling the truth.

522
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,700
Where did those

523
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,260
women who were sold by you come from?

524
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,140
I really don't know.

525
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,740
Someone

526
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,940
always brought them back by carriage.

527
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:02,980
We didn't dare to ask

528
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,260
if the boss didn't tell us.

529
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,100
It was the boss

530
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,380
who greeted Ji Yuan.

531
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,340
We were

532
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,060
responsible for sending them back.

533
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,380
Mrs. Gu.

534
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,020
Please let us go.

535
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,980
We're just a bunch of little kids.

536
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,500
We don't know much.

537
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,780
Tie them up.

538
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,900
Take me to your boss's place.

539
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,260
Okay.

540
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,140
This is our boss's room.

541
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,540
We don't dare to enter it.

542
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,780
Please.

543
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,500
You're reading?

544
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,780
I'm not going to lie to you.

545
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,340
These books are all set up.

546
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,180
I've never seen our boss read them.

547
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,980
So no one has been here since?

548
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,300
No.

549
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,420
Hu Shisan disappeared last night?

550
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,340
It should be last night.

551
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,540
The next morning,

552
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,340
we found our boss missing.

553
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,300
What was the meaning of last night?

554
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,300
I remember something strange.

555
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,660
The night before our boss disappeared,

556
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,660
I happened to pass by his room.

557
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,060
I found...

558
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,460
Crying?

559
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,020
I've never seen my boss cry before.

560
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,380
So I remember it.

561
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,820
Take those two people with you.

562
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,140
Come with me to the police station.

563
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,180
Young Master.

564
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,780
What are we doing here?

565
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,060
The evidence is suspicious.

566
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,380
Let's check it out.

567
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,300
Wait for me outside.

568
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,300
Yes.

569
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,620
What's wrong? You scared me.

570
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,460
Go.

571
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,140
There's a thief.

572
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,460
That stupid thief won't come back.

573
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,460
What's wrong?

574
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,460
I'm scared.

575
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,460
I'm scared.

576
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,460
What's wrong?

577
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,460
I'm scared.

578
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,460
I'm scared.

579
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,460
I'm scared.

580
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,460
I'm scared.

581
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,460
I'm scared.

582
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,460
I'm scared.

583
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,500
Come here.

584
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,380
Come here.

585
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,780
Help me.

586
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,780
Okay.

587
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:39,860
Your Highness.

588
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:47,020
Your Highness.

589
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:56,380
Your Highness, Your Highness.

590
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,460
Your Highness, Your Highness.

591
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,300
Chen Tong Yuan.

592
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,180
What are you doing here?

593
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,820
I'm here to pack up.

594
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,180
You're home so late.

595
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,540
Your jacket looks nice.

596
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,340
I remember I came here once.

597
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,580
I didn't realize

598
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,380
it looked so nice.

599
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,420
You're the son of the chief of the secret police.

600
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,740
When did you become a thief?

601
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,780
You're mistaken.

602
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,060
I've already passed.

603
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,060
I heard you were investigating

604
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,060
a case of the grave.

605
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,100
I wanted to come and talk to you about the case.

606
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,260
I didn't expect you to be home.

607
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,580
So I came in without thinking.

608
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,620
Excuse me.

609
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,740
Your secret police always

610
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,140
do big cases and big cases.

611
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,540
When did you become interested in such small cases?

612
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,020
I'm not interested in cases.

613
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,780
I'm interested in you.

614
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,780
What did you think about

615
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,100
the cooperation I mentioned last time?

616
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,980
What's there to think about?

617
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,260
You really don't want to cooperate with me?

618
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:53,900
All right.

619
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:54,860
I won't bother you.

620
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,020
Goodbye.

621
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,100
Go.

622
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,740
Master, have you found anything?

623
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,660
Find more people to keep an eye on them.

624
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,380
Yes.

625
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,100
Yes.

626
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:37,340
It's so dangerous.

627
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,700
Zhong Buhui, he didn't find us.

628
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,060
I went to check on him.

629
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,060
I'm afraid it won't last long.

630
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,340
Zhong Buhui, what did you find?

631
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,660
I'm in a bad mood now.

632
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,820
Why don't we talk about the case?

633
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,300
Maybe I can help.

634
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,900
Yes, he's like this.

635
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:01,740
Anyways,

636
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,300
I've been looking for you.

637
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,420
But you didn't come here.

638
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,420
I knew he won't come.

639
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,260
Even though you were trying to trick me,

640
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:13,480
he didn't know I was here.

641
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:16,780
Master,

642
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,060
the way this teacher comes at me

643
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:24,900
looks like someone makes me feel smoothly.

644
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,660
That's not true.

645
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,060
Hu Shisan's subordinate said

646
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,140
only Hu Shisan knew

647
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:29,980
where the girl who was caught

648
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,980
got the key.

649
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,540
Then the clue was broken.

650
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,700
So you can't find it.

651
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,260
There are many.

652
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:37,940
The body of the victim.

653
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,300
All the bodies are in Baishui River.

654
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,700
There are four bodies.

655
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,780
Three have been burnt.

656
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,020
Now there are no coroners there.

657
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:45,780
I'm not worried

658
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,780
if Master Yan knows.

659
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,620
I'm worried.

660
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,820
Although I haven't checked

661
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,740
any major cases,

662
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,140
Master Yan is very capable

663
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,500
to take care of the family.

664
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,900
You're a five-star, Zhong Bukui.

665
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,500
Zhong Bukui, I know

666
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,460
you must be worried about my safety.

667
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,780
But don't worry.

668
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,860
I won't cause you trouble.

669
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,060
Are you worried that

670
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,180
I'll run away after you all leave?

671
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,620
Don't worry about that.

672
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,060
He's out of internal force now.

673
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,580
He's wearing such a heavy chain

674
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,580
to get away.

675
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:19,980
Zhong Bukui,

676
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,180
if you're really worried,

677
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,180
you can take me away.

678
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,380
I'm by your side.

679
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,540
Don't worry.

680
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:29,940
Who's that?

681
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:30,940
Coming.

682
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,820
Sister.

683
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,500
Why are you here?

684
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,180
You're the one who's going to be the night guard.

685
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,300
Since I was assigned here,

686
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,580
I can only take this place as my home.

687
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,700
It's dark and dark.

688
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,380
I'll bring someone to check the bodies.

689
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,300
Where are the bodies sent this afternoon?

690
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,140
In the golden room.

691
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:49,780
I'll take you there.

692
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,380
No need.

693
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,580
I'll go by myself.

694
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,460
You know who that is?

695
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,540
Didn't she just move in?

696
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,020
It's forreten you, right?

697
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:29,620
Don't you know?

698
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,140
Move.

699
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,500
What's this?

700
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,500
Let me see.

701
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,500
It's a golden silk.

702
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,500
How can there be a golden silk?

703
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,500
Let's see the other three bodies.

704
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,500
Okay.

705
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,500
The other three bodies are burnt.

706
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,500
But they all have golden silk on their faces.

707
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,500
Go!

708
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,500
Go!

709
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,500
Go!

710
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,500
Is anyone there?

711
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,500
Help!

712
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,500
Help!

713
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,500
Is anyone there?

714
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,500
Is anyone there?

715
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,500
Go!

716
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,500
Go!

717
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,500
Go!

718
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,500
Hurry up!

719
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,500
Please hold on!

720
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,500
Hurry up!

721
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,500
Hurry up!

722
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,500
Hurry up!

723
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,500
Hurry up!

724
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,500
Hurry up!

725
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,500
Go!

726
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,500
Wait!

727
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,500
There are more people!

728
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,500
Why are you here?

729
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,500
This is...

730
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,500
I want to ask you.

731
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,500
Why are you here?

732
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,500
The chief brought us to patrol nearby.

733
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,500
He came here when he saw the fire.

734
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,500
I brought people to check the body.

735
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,500
I almost got burned to death inside.

736
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,500
Since you were on duty tonight,

737
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,500
you can't escape from this

738
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,500
endless fire.

739
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,500
Who opened the door today?

740
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,500
What happened to the ball?

741
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,500
There's blood on the street.

742
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,500
We need to treat it quickly.

743
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,500
Go!

744
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,500
Go!

745
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,500
Zhu Xue Man?

746
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,500
Why are you here?

747
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,500
We can't leave now.

748
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,500
Wan Zhu.

749
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,500
I have a new idea about Feng Shao.

750
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,500
I'll ask Feng Wu to check the room.

751
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,500
Have you found anything?

752
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,500
It was on fire not long after we entered.

753
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,500
You're hurt?

754
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,500
Go and treat it quickly.

755
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,500
Thank you, chief.

756
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,500
Wait.

757
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,500
Who is this?

758
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,500
Chief.

759
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,500
This is...

760
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,500
Raise your head.

761
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,500
Speak.

762
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,500
Chief, I'm here to help.

763
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,500
What are you talking about?

764
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,500
Chief.

765
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,500
I invited him here.

766
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,500
He was just checking four bodies.

767
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,500
He was too busy to come.

768
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,500
So I asked someone to help.

769
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,500
I didn't expect that he got on fire

770
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,500
and burned his hand.

771
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,500
So I want to treat him now.

772
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,500
Look.

773
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,500
He's hurt like this.

774
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,500
His shoulder is also injured.

775
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,500
Go.

776
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,500
Go to the doctor.

777
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,500
Go.

778
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,500
Thank you, chief.

779
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,500
Be patient.

780
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,500
We'll go to apply the medicine.

781
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,500
Wait.

782
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,500
Since Feng Wu invited you,

783
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,500
you should have a background.

784
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,500
Which office are you in?

785
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,500
Which clothing store are you working in?

786
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,500
Why haven't I and the chief seen you before?

787
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,500
Turn around.

788
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,500
This may be...

789
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,500
I mean him.

790
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,500
Since you're out,

791
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,500
why are you wearing a mask?

792
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,500
I told you not to report it.

793
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,500
Don't report it.

794
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,500
Morris is a fan of Feng Wu.

795
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,500
Look at you.

796
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,500
You made this thing look so bad.

797
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,500
Did you accidentally

798
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,500
burn the house?

799
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,500
What are you talking about?

800
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,500
This is my fellow.

801
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,500
What I just said is our hometown dialect.

802
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,500
He just came to the capital and didn't understand anything.

803
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,500
I asked him to help Feng Wu.

804
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,500
I didn't expect this to happen.

805
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,500
I'll ask Feng Wu to help you in the future.

806
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,500
I'll ask Feng Wu to help you in the future.

807
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,500
I'll ask Feng Wu to help you in the future.

808
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,500
Be careful in the future.

809
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,500
Chief Feng,

810
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,500
the fire is so big.

811
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,500
What if the police ask?

812
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,500
Hurry up and save the fire.

813
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,500
Okay.

814
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,500
Yiting,

815
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,500
prepare the horse.

816
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,500
We have to go to the police station.

817
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,500
Yes.

818
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,500
Be careful.

819
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,500
Brother.

820
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,500
Zhou Xi.

821
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,500
Brother.

822
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,500
What's the relationship between you two?

823
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,500
Why should I tell you?

824
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,500
If you don't say it,

825
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,500
don't think about leaving here.

826
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,500
Come on.

827
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,500
Officer Zhong,

828
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,500
he's my man on the program.

829
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,500
Did you find out everything about the bomb?

830
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,500
This plan is too risky.

831
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,500
I don't agree.

832
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,500
You will die.

833
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,500
I have no choice.

834
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,500
Okay.

835
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,500
Go do what you should do.

836
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,500
Your people?

837
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:25,500
I still don't know.

838
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,500
If my brother didn't let me

839
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,500
use you as a weapon,

840
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,500
I would have hit you long ago.

841
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,500
You put him in the police station?

842
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,500
Yes.

843
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,500
Feng Sha's clue

844
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,500
was revealed to me by him.

845
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,500
How many things are you hiding from me?

846
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,500
Only this one.

847
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,500
You already know it.

848
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,500
What do you want me to do?

849
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,500
What do you want to do?

850
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,500
You still want to do it?

851
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,500
You want to do it?

852
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,500
You want to do it?

853
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,500
Just say it.

854
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,500
Don't do it.

855
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,500
Don't do it.

856
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,500
Tong Sheng,

857
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,500
you go out first.

858
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,500
I go out?

859
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,500
Brother, what about you?

860
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,500
I'm fine.

861
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,500
You're hurt.

862
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,500
I can't die.

863
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,500
But these people...

864
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,500
If you keep making trouble,

865
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,500
I will be more uncomfortable than dying.

866
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,500
Be good.

867
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,500
You go out first.

868
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,500
Okay.

869
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,500
I warn you.

870
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,500
If my brother has a three-way power,

871
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,500
I will kill you

872
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,500
even if I have to die.

873
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,500
Zhong Bu Hui,

874
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,500
I found him in the police station.

875
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,500
But to investigate Feng Shi,

876
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,500
I found the interviewer and caught him.

877
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,500
There is no other way.

878
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,500
The most important thing now is to investigate the case.

879
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,500
The case is investigated.

880
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,500
Everything is clear.

881
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,500
Yes, yes, yes.

882
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,500
Investigate. Investigate.

883
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,500
It's weird to say that.

884
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,500
When we just arrived at the Golden Room,

885
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,500
there was a fire.

886
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,500
And the door of the Golden Room

887
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,500
was locked from the outside.

888
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,500
You said that this fire

889
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,500
was coming for us, right?

890
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,500
Yes.

891
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,500
Only the tailor

892
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,500
doesn't want us to investigate the case.

893
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,500
At that time,

894
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,500
the silk I found under the dead's skin

895
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,500
was pure, high, gentle and smooth.

896
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,500
And it will not break the skin

897
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,500
with the skin activity.

898
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,500
I don't know what it does.

899
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,500
In the Nine Zhou Yizhi,

900
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,500
there is a secret technique

901
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,500
called the gold silk eyes.

902
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,500
Put the silk of the delicate hair

903
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,500
under the woman's skin.

904
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,500
It can make the woman

905
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,500
weak and clear,

906
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,500
youthful and permanent.

907
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,500
The silk we found

908
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,500
should be used by the gold silk eyes.

909
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,500
Gold silk eyes.

910
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,500
Too cruel.

911
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,500
Does Daqi have such a secret technique?

912
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,500
Nan Yue.

913
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,500
In the Nine Zhou Yizhi,

914
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,500
it is said that

915
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,500
it is a secret technique of the people of Nan Yue.

916
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,500
It seems that these four dead people

917
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,500
are related to the people of Nan Yue.

918
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,500
Isn't Nan Yue destroyed?

919
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,500
Yes.

920
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,500
Then where should we go?

921
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,500
The Man's statue.

922
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,500
The Man's statue.

923
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,500
Since the clues point to Nan Yue,

924
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,500
the Man's statue

925
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,500
will be discovered.

926
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,500
Oh, no.

927
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,500
All our evidence

928
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,500
is in the chain room.

929
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,500
It's probably burned to ashes.

930
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,500
Without evidence,

931
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,500
the Shen Gu Yin

932
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,500
will not support you to investigate.

933
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,500
I don't need them to support me.

934
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,500
I'll investigate it myself.

935
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,500
This...

936
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,500
I'll go with you.

937
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,500
Men are not clear about the situation.

938
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,500
It's not a bad thing to have one more person.

939
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,500
You come with us.

940
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,500
I'm worried that you'll stay here alone.

941
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,500
What kind of worry?

942
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,500
I'll go with you.

943
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,500
It's all new.

944
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,500
It's been a long time.

945
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,500
How many people can afford the gold?

946
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,500
Nothing to investigate.

947
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,500
Let's go to the gold shop.

948
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,500
Maybe there will be some clues.

949
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,500
Hello, sirs.

950
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,500
What can I do for you?

951
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,500
My butler said that

952
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,500
your gold shop is famous.

953
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,500
So I brought my wife to have a look.

954
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,500
You two look like

955
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,500
a couple of geniuses.

956
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,500
Come to my shop and buy gold.

957
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,500
The craftsmanship of the people in Nan Yue

958
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,500
is not comparable to that of others.

959
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,500
Come on, you two.

960
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,500
Take a look.

961
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,500
Sirs, how about this one?

962
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,500
These are too ordinary.

963
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,500
You two look so good.

964
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,500
Wait a minute.

965
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,500
I have a few more gifts in my shop.

966
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,500
I'll go and get them for you.

967
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,500
Please wait a minute.

968
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,500
Let this bake for 30 minutes.

969
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,500
And it's done.

970
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,500
Came.

971
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,500
Wait a minute.

972
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,500
That one is better.

973
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,500
Coming.

974
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,100
We've found what we want.

975
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:39,700
I heard that the South Vietnamese

976
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,300
are good at the art of gold silk.

977
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,100
My wife is beautiful and beautiful.

978
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,100
I want to know

979
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,300
if you know anyone who knows this art?

980
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,300
What gold silk?

981
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,700
I've never heard of it.

982
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,140
There should be no gold

983
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,300
in my shop.

984
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,300
The shop's gold is rough and rough.

985
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,300
You guys should go to other places.

986
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,700
Really?

987
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,100
It's said that the South Vietnamese

988
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,700
use gold paper and a cutting hammer

989
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,700
to make gold silk.

990
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,300
Wrap the gold with a towel paper

991
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,900
and hammer 36,000 times with a 7-centimeter hammer

992
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,100
to get the gold silk that can be used for salt.

993
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,100
This is what you use to make gold silk, right?

994
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,900
I didn't understand a word you said.

995
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,300
The shop is still doing business.

996
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,900
Please come this way.

997
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,100
Please come this way.

998
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,100
Please come this way.

999
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,700
Boss.

1000
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,300
I think you don't understand.

1001
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,100
You're just afraid of getting in trouble.

1002
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:31,700
No.

1003
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,700
You're forcing me to drive you away, right?

1004
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,700
Go. Go. Go.

1005
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,700
Look.

1006
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,100
It hurts.

1007
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,500
Mr. Feng, close the door.

1008
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,700
Mr. Wu, who are you?

1009
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,700
The case of Shen Buying.

1010
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,500
Who did you sell the gold silk to?

1011
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,300
I...

1012
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,900
I really don't know anything.

1013
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,300
If you tell the truth,

1014
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,500
you'll be punished less.

1015
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,500
I'm just a businessman.

1016
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,900
I didn't break any law.

1017
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,700
Why did you arrest me?

1018
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:04,500
There have been several serial murder cases in Beijing recently.

1019
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,700
We suspect the murderer is related to the gold silk.

1020
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,700
What gold silk?

1021
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,300
I really don't know anything.

1022
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,100
Boss.

1023
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,700
It seems that we can only take Shen Buying out for murder.

1024
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,500
What is murder?

1025
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,700
Shen Buying used to deal with

1026
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,500
some small ways to get rid of the criminals.

1027
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,300
Tie the clothes to the iron bed.

1028
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,300
Pour boiling water on the body.

1029
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,300
Use iron comb to brush it.

1030
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,700
Some people are hard-mouthed.

1031
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,900
Brush the skin close.

1032
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,700
Don't even say that you're showing your white bones.

1033
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:32,700
Burn more water.

1034
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,100
I think the boss is very hard-mouthed.

1035
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,100
So I have to brush it for a long time.

1036
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,100
Burn the temperature higher.

1037
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,100
I say, I say.

1038
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,900
It's... It's Hua Man Tian.

1039
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:42,700
What?

1040
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,500
I gave the gold silk to Hua Man Tian.

1041
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,100
What is Hua Man Tian?

1042
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,900
Hua Man Tian is the holy and honorable

1043
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,100
of our Southlanders.

1044
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,900
He is specially protecting our Southlanders.

1045
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:54,300
Hua Man Tian's leader, Sada, is the ambassador of Shang Qingtian.

1046
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,100
I just gave these gold silk to Sada.

1047
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:59,300
I think it's the holy and honorable of our Sada.

1048
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,700
Do you know this woman?

1049
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,700
How do you know our holy woman's portrait?

1050
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,100
What do you know?

1051
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,700
This is the holy woman two months ago.

1052
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:08,900
She has been taken by Shang Qingtian

1053
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,300
to protect our Southlanders.

1054
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,300
Shang Qingtian took away

1055
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,500
a few holy women two months ago.

1056
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,100
I...

1057
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:14,700
You put all the effort into it.

1058
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:15,500
Yes, yes, yes.

1059
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,100
I did it myself.

1060
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,500
I... I'm telling the truth.

1061
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,100
Shang Qingtian took away five holy women two months ago.

1062
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,500
Four of them were killed by the typhoon.

1063
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,900
It's so obvious.

1064
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,100
When the holy light came from the sky,

1065
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,700
the holy woman was taken away

1066
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,500
by Shang Qingtian as soon as the holy light came.

1067
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,300
It's so amazing.

1068
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,700
Is there really something?

1069
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,300
I don't believe there's anything dangerous.

1070
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:43,500
Someone must have done it.

1071
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,700
Otherwise, the holy woman who was kidnapped

1072
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,500
would have died in the hands of Yasha.

1073
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:49,700
The owner of the shop said

1074
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,300
every Thursday of the 15th,

1075
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,500
Hua Man Tian will hold a fireworks ceremony.

1076
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,500
The holy woman will be selected from the shop

1077
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,500
and given to Shang Qingtian.

1078
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,500
It's June now,

1079
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,100
and it's the 15th.

1080
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,300
Isn't it tonight?

1081
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,500
I'll know when I go and see.

1082
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:16,300
Young Master.

1083
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,300
Zhong Qun Man took someone to the manor.

1084
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,100
Are our people following us?

1085
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:23,300
Yes.

1086
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,500
The night is deep and the night is bright.

1087
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,700
The mountain and the moon are in the clouds.

1088
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,700
The shadow is so bright.

1089
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:05,900
The night is so silent but I still want to be with you.

1090
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,500
The blood is so cold.

1091
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,700
The heart is so agitated.

1092
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:09,700
The flower is so beautiful.

1093
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,500
The wind is so strong.

1094
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:14,700
The stone is so big.

1095
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:15,500
The body is so deep.

1096
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,500
The soul is so long.

1097
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:20,300
Where can I go?

1098
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:53,500
The night is deep and the night is bright.

1099
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,500
The mountain and the moon are in the clouds.

1100
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,500
The blood is so cold.

1101
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,500
The heart is so strong.

1102
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,500
The flower is so bright.

1103
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,500
The wind is so strong.

1104
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,500
The heart is so strong.

1105
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,500
The flower is so beautiful.

1106
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,500
The flower is so bright.

1107
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,500
The heart is so strong.

1108
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,500
The flower is so beautiful.

1109
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,500
The flower is so beautiful.

1110
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,500
The flower is so beautiful.

1111
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,700
The flower is so beautiful.

1112
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,700
The flower is so beautiful.

1113
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:24,700
The flower is so beautiful.

1114
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,700
The flower is so beautiful.

1115
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:28,700
The flower is so beautiful.

1116
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,700
The flower is so beautiful.

1117
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:32,700
The flower is so beautiful.

1118
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:34,700
The flower is so beautiful.

1119
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:36,700
The flower is so beautiful.

1120
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,700
The flower is so beautiful.

1121
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,700
The flower is so beautiful.

1122
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,700
The flower is so beautiful.

1123
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,700
The flower is so beautiful.

1124
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,700
The flower is so beautiful.

1125
