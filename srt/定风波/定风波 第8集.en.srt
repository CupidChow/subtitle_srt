[Episode 8]

17
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,960
You want me to go find him

18
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,190
and investigate the case with him?

19
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,630
Do you remember which year I told you

20
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,840
about the incident in Haiya?

21
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,280
The 36th year of Ningtai.

22
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,520
Miao Jie once said

23
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,400
that Master was terrified of people

24
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,800
finding out about what happened back then.

25
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,560
If that incident refers to

26
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,020
the destruction of Haiya,

27
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,260
then that year should be

28
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,660
the 36th year of Ningtai.

29
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,590
Since Miao Jie mentioned this matter,

30
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,360
it means he's also privy to it.

31
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,079
So we need to check

32
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,870
Master's and Miao Jie's resume documents

33
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,870
to see where they were

34
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,910
and what they did

35
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,910
in that year,

36
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,430
which might give us some leads.

37
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,280
But all officials' resume documents

38
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,400
are kept in the Imperial Secretariat,

39
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,280
and the Elite Constabulary Unit

40
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,470
doesn't have major case authority now.

41
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,710
According to the laws of the Qi Kingdom,

42
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,960
we can't enter the Imperial Secretariat

43
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,560
and access those documents.

44
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,250
So that's why you want me

45
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,650
to go find Zhuge Kongyun?

46
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,590
But he's naturally suspicious.

47
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,720
Why would he help me?

48
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,470
When fishing, you need bait, of course.

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,800
Young Master,

50
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,800
did you stay up all night?

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,470
I've gone through

52
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,680
these four officials' documents

53
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,840
several times already,

54
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,970
but I really can't see anything wrong.

55
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,040
All I can tell is that they have

56
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,240
served the country and the people

57
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,310
with utmost dedication.

58
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,190
I really don't understand

59
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,360
why Xiao Beiming would target

60
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,650
these four officials.

61
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,550
Young Master,

62
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,510
are we on the wrong track?

63
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,190
No,

64
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,120
we're on the right track.

65
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,200
Have you found something

66
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,070
in these documents?

67
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,159
The Council Chamber?

68
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,120
The problem lies in the Council Chamber.

69
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,560
In the 36th year of Ningtai,

70
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,659
the late emperor passed away

71
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:57,920
and His Majesty ascended the throne.

72
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,480
The late emperor was gravely ill then,

73
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,630
too weak to attend court,

74
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,120
so several officials

75
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,430
from various ministries
were temporarily assigned

76
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,120
to help him handle state affairs.

77
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,180
The side hall

78
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,240
where these officials were stationed

79
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,510
was called the Council Chamber.

80
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,040
The 36th year of Ningtai...

81
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,950
This year is the 22nd year of Xingwen.

82
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,000
Even if the four officials

83
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,600
worked together in the Council Chamber,

84
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,060
that was over 20 years ago.

85
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,560
Could Xiao Beiming really kill them

86
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,800
just because of that?

87
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,310
Xiao Beiming was too young

88
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,720
to remember anything back then.

89
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,160
Besides the tombstone statue,

90
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,540
this is the only connection

91
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,360
we've found between these four officials.

92
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,190
The Council Chamber

93
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,920
isn't a motive for the killing.

94
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,110
So I'm wondering

95
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,760
if these four officials

96
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,430
did anything together at that time

97
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,870
and caused any trouble.

98
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,510
But there's nothing recorded

99
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,860
in these documents.

100
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,270
Precisely.

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,930
And that makes it more suspicious.

102
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,270
In the 36th year of Ningtai,

103
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,190
what exactly happened?

104
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,750
Young Master,

105
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,750
someone is asking to see you.

106
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,510
Who is it?

107
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,000
It's Zhong Xueman
from the Elite Constabulary Unit.

108
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,070
Since childhood,

109
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,820
you've never approached me

110
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,150
on your own initiative.

111
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,530
Is there something important

112
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,580
for you to come here this time?

113
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,050
Haven't you always wanted

114
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,000
to work with me?

115
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,970
You've changed your mind?

116
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,170
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

117
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,720
Is Mr. Shen dead?

118
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,890
You're well-informed.

119
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,390
I'm not surprised.

120
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,940
Seven officials were killed 3 years ago,

121
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,230
and one of them was my father.

122
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,570
Recently in the corpse-sewing case,

123
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,340
seven more people died.

124
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,470
Including Mr. Shen,

125
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,680
a total of 15 people

126
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,360
were brutally killed by Yesha.

127
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,800
Compared to these lives,

128
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,480
the feud between our two units

129
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,680
means nothing.

130
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,920
If we can catch Yesha sooner,

131
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,800
everyone

132
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,820
will be relieved much sooner.

133
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,270
I do hate Yesha,

134
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,570
but I can still tell right from wrong.

135
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,890
It's admirable

136
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,920
that you can think that way.

137
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,870
So you agree?

138
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,070
Mr. Shen died tragically.

139
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,400
His Majesty was furious

140
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,090
and ordered the Secret Investigation Unit

141
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,090
to solve this case

142
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,870
and arrest Yesha within a month.

143
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,270
Having your help at this time

144
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,750
is exactly what I need.

145
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,480
But now

146
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,160
all the clues have been cut off,

147
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,560
and I'm completely lost.

148
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,360
I actually have a clue.

149
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,920
I'm all ears.

150
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,159
I can tell you,

151
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,790
but you need to promise me

152
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,070
that I can investigate the case with you.

153
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,270
That depends on whether this clue

154
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,200
is useful or not.

155
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,800
If it's useless...

156
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
Zhuge Kongyun,

157
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,680
if it weren't for wanting

158
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,840
to catch Yesha quickly,

159
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,120
I would never have come to see you.

160
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,040
I've already broken

161
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,270
the Elite Constabulary Unit's rules,

162
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,070
yet you're still playing games with me.

163
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,430
Since you don't trust me,

164
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,630
let's part ways here.

165
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,950
Wait!

166
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,890
You're so quick-tempered.

167
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,750
What is needed for investigating a case?

168
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,040
Calmness.

169
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,040
Look at you!

170
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,930
Can you just...

171
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,360
Fine.

172
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,310
I promise you.

173
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,460
But I also have one condition.

174
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,430
Speak.

175
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,390
If I capture Yesha, Xiao Beiming,

176
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,840
you can't take justice
into your own hands.

177
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,909
He must be handed over to my unit,

178
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:39,360
agreed?

179
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,000
Agreed.

180
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,480
If your mind isn't calm,

181
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,750
you won't win.

182
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,390
Is it because of

183
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,910
Mr. Shen Bi?

184
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,610
Mr. Shen died because of me,

185
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,550
yet I have no clues.

186
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So you made a risky move

187
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,720
by sending Xueman to find Zhuge Kongyun.

188
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,480
Attack can be a form of defense,

189
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,200
and defense can be a strategy for attack.

190
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,360
This is a risky move,

191
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,240
but also a vital one.

192
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,600
But Zhuge Kongyun

193
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,870
won't be content just to be a mere pawn.

194
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,390
If there's even the slightest oversight,

195
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,080
he'll jump off the chessboard.

196
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,140
When that happens,

197
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,060
you won't be able to control the situation.

198
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,410
Make your move.

199
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,150
Master.

200
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,130
Do those orphans from Haiya

201
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,390
have anything to do with you?

202
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,380
You said Xiao Beiming had a big fight

203
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,720
with King Zhong of Constables

204
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,320
before the Fengbo Lake case?

205
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:14,590
That's right.

206
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,100
They argued fiercely.

207
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,500
But I didn't hear

208
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,150
the specific details of their argument.

209
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,960
I only vaguely heard a few words.

210
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,440
What words?

211
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,120
The 36th year of Ningtai.

212
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,370
What does that mean?

213
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,320
In the 36th year of Ningtai,

214
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:32,960
I wasn't even born then.

215
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,420
I don't know what it means,

216
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,600
but the fact that they mentioned

217
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,650
this year during their argument

218
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:37,850
must be significant.

219
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:38,960
I'm wondering

220
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,550
what exactly happened that year.

221
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,130
Could it be related to Yesha

222
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,250
killing my father?

223
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,200
In the 36th year of Ningtai,

224
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,750
where did King Zhong of Constables work?

225
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,030
My father once mentioned he was a soldier

226
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,150
before joining
the Elite Constabulary Unit.

227
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:55,790
But I don't know

228
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,080
which army he served in

229
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,000
specifically.

230
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,650
That's why I came to you,

231
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,950
hoping to check my father's documents.

00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,630
is there anything

I can help you with?

243

How could these documents

be tampered with?

245
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,120
Well...

246
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,000
My Lords,
please be careful with your words.

247
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,330
Don't make accusations like that easily.

248
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,840
See for yourself.

249
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,150
The documents of King Zhong of Constables

from the 36th year of Ningtai and earlier

251
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,920
have all been torn up.

00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,630
This...

253
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,950
I really don't know

254
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:05,930
what happened.

255
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,700
For officials of his rank,

256
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,840
their documents

257
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,150
must be personally reviewed

258
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,630
by His Majesty and the cabinet

259
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,550
every year

260
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,360
before they can be filed and sealed.

261
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,870
Not to mention tearing them up,

262
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,440
even to review them,

263
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,790
you need to have a review order.

264
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,320
So what's going on here?

265
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,720
Unless

266
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,140
they had been torn up before being filed.

267
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,140
How dare you!

268
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,370
I wouldn't dare.

269
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,610
Forgive me, My Lord.

270
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,510
Leave.

271
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,150
Yes.

272
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,450
Is he suggesting...

273
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,700
Could it be that His Majesty...

274
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,690
So what should we do now?

275
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,120
Although his documents

276
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,080
were torn up,

277
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,150
after the 36th year of Ningtai,

278
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,320
he was indeed transferred
from the Ministry of War

279
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,790
to the Ministry of Justice.

280
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,440
We can check

281
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,910
the documents of the Ministry of War.

282
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,840
Since the King of Constables
once served in the military,

283
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,840
there must be comrades we can trace.

284

Let's see

285
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,360

yet Constable Zhong hasn't come back.

Could something have happened to her?

294

That woman

295
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,770
could handle ten sly foxes

You think Zhuge Kongyun

298
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,320
is just like you,

299
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,250
only knowing how to fight and kill?

300
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,490

I'm not hungry. Give it to Feng Qingzhuo.

305

No.

compared to Xiao Beiming back then?

310
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,630
Let's get to the point.

311
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,030

their documents
from the 36th year of Ningtai

have also been torn up.

It seems

someone

321
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,120
doesn't want us to discover

what happened back then.

323

Mr. Miao was killed
at Fengbo Lake 3 years ago

Let's go find him.

329
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,990
Constable Zhong, I remember 3 years ago

330
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,670
when you married Xiao Beiming,

331
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,330
General Huo was also present.

332
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,600
What was his relationship

333
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,860
with your father like?

334
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,400
I've met General Huo a few times,

335
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,370
just normal interactions.

336
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,720
Our families had no personal connection,

337
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,120
no gatherings or visits.

338
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,600
I don't know anyone
from the Huo family at all.

339
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,670
That's strange.

340
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,030
General Huo and King Zhong of Constables

341
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,150
were once comrades in the army.

342
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,010
Logically speaking,

343
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,720
they should have had a good relationship,

344
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,960
not as distant as

345
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,790
you remember.

346
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,500
I'm certain I'm not mistaken.

347
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,750
We're almost there.

348
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,750
Let's go find out.

349
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,870
Someone has died.

350
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,150
Could it be General Huo?

351
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,790
Who are you? Who are you looking for?

352
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,270
Zhuge Kongyun
from the Secret Investigation Unit.

353
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,910
I'm here on urgent business
to see General Huo Zongyao.

354
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,200
You've come at a bad time.

355
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,320
My master...

356
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,650
passed away last night.

357
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,270
General Huo is dead?

358
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,120
That's right.

359
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,120
Another one died?

360
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,150
What's the cause of death?

361
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,120
The Huo family said

362
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,030
that he died suddenly of an old illness.

363
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,360
General Huo
held a high position with great authority.

364
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,450
At a time like this, even Zhuge Kongyun

365
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:35,870
can't enter the residence
to ask questions.

366
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,840
We can only wait until after the funeral.

367
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,120
When we investigated Mr. Shen,

368
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,240
he died.

369
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,480
When we investigated General Huo,

370
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,720
he also died.

371
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,390
This is definitely not a coincidence.

372
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,090
You suspect

373
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,630
Yesha's people did this too?

374
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,510
We need to investigate to find out.

375
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,720
I need to go to the Huo Mansion.

376
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,440
Boss, no!

377
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,960
You're a wanted criminal now!

378
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,480
Yes, it's too dangerous.

379
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,030
The Secret Investigation Unit
knows you're still alive.

380
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,120
Timing is crucial in investigations.

381
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,840
Many key pieces of evidence
vanish in an instant.

382
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,970
If I had been present

383
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,870
when Mr. Shen died,

384
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,970
I could have immediately

385
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:01,870
determined his cause of death.

386
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:02,750
Then the poisoner

387
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,000
would not have escaped.

388
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,400
General Huo died
in the early hours of last night.

389
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,440
There's still time.

390
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,790
But if we really wait
until after the funeral,

391
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,349
it will be too late.

392
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,790
Xueman.

393
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,210
What happened with Mr. Shen

394
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:15,880
cannot happen again.

395
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,640
I understand.

396
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,880
I'll see to it.

397
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,680
What kind of strange clothes are these?

398
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,480
There are bats and the moon.

399
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,720
Are you afraid that others won't see us?

400
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,000
You fool.

401
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,960
General Huo's body is lying in state.

402
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,680
Many people will come to

403
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,000
pay their respects to the deceased.

404
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,960
In the Huo Mansion,

405
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,880
they need to light the ever-burning lamps

406
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,920
and someone
must watch over the flames all night.

407
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,640
Look.

408
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,630
Those people lighting the lamps

409
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,890
are all wearing these.

410
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,880
This is the attire of night watchman.

411
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,640
Then what do these bats

412
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,640
and the moon mean?

413
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,240
Bat sounds like "fu",
meaning fortune in Chinese.

414
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,530
Four bats surrounding the moon

415
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,510
resembles a copper coin,
symbolizing prosperity.

416
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,510
Since life is gone,

417
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,310
it is important
to hold onto fortune and prosperity.

418
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,750
Those who keep vigil for the deceased,

419
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,790
apart from family members,

420
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,270
are often honored guests.

421
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,590
So the servants won't ask many questions.

422
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,830
Well,

423
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,090
you may not be tall,

424
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,450
but you know quite a lot.

425
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,160
Let's first examine

426
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,310
General Huo's body.

427
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,030
Be careful.

428
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,590
If we're discovered, I'll cover the rear

429
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,550
while you all escape.

430
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,680
I'm a grown man standing right here...

431
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,400
And you want to be the hero?

432
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,200
Enough.

433
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,110
We came together,
and we should leave together.

434
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,270
Stay alert

435
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,240
and act according to circumstances.

436
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,640
Especially you, Tong Shuang,

437
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,640
don't be reckless.

438
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,590
Don't worry, Boss.

439
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,590
I will be careful.

440
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,550
Let's go.

441
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,070
Did you hear that?

442
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,030
Stay calm.

443
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,640
Be careful.

444
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,880
Mind and behave yourself!

445
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:38,050
[Memorial Tablet of General Huo Zongyao]

446
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,070
[General Huo's eldest disciple
Xue Qianshan]

447
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,600
[General Huo's second disciple
Li Xiao]

448
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,620
I've long heard that General Huo

449
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,110
took in many disciples
and kept them in his mansion.

450
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,000
Today I see it's indeed true.

451
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,110
Those people in the front hall

452
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,290
are clearly skilled fighters.

453
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:31,950
We must avoid provoking them.

454
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,070
The Huo Mansion is vast.

455
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,400
The study, bedrooms,

456
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,200
and places where General Huo

457
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,390
used to go

458
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,960
might all contain important clues.

459
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,400
Now the mansion is busy with people,

460
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,230
making it the perfect time to blend in.

461
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,320
Let's split up.

462
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:42,960
Tong Shuang,

463
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,310
you and I will go to
General Huo's quarters.

464
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:44,920
Xueman,

465
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,150
take Feng Qingzhuo to the backyard.

466
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:46,770
In an hour,

467
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,990
we'll meet back here.

468
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,310
Be careful.

469
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,510
You search over there.

470
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,240
What about you?

471
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,110
I'll go to the disciples' quarters.

472
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,230
I think we should

473
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,540
stay together.

474
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:18,890
Are you scared?

475
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,240
Who's scared?

476
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,660
[Excellent in medical skills
and noble in medical ethics]

477
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,550
Please,

478
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,830
don't kill me.

479
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,170
You're not here to keep vigil.

480
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,270
Who are you?

481
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,680
Tell me,

482
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,840
what are you doing in my home?

483
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,110
Since you're a girl,

484
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,440
I don't want to hurt you.

485
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,590
Be sensible

486
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,030
and don't scream.

487
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,960
You're a girl too.

488
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,780
As a girl yourself,

489
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,110
why do you have to
make things difficult for another girl?

490
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,710
Judging by your appearance,

491
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,760
I guess you're not here to steal.

492
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,870
This is the training ground,

493
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,640
full of weapons and armor,

494
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,920
with nothing of value.

495
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,110
Even the stupidest thief

496
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,710
wouldn't come here to steal.

497
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,000
I found you,

498
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,030
but you didn't kill me or run away,

499
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,020
which means you haven't finished

500
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,420
what you wanted to do yet.

501
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:36,790

You suspect Huo Zongyao's death

512
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,050
is connected to Yesha, Xiao Beiming?

513

Any basis for your theory?

515
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,400
Intuition.

516
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,670
If we relied on intuition to solve cases,

517
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,430
what would be the point of laws?

518
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,550
Don't say things like that

519
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,680
in front of me again.

520
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,350
Father.

521
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,950
Enough. If there really is
something suspicious

522
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:19,960
about Huo Zongyao's death,

523
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,480
the Huo family will report it.

524
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,640
You are too obsessed with Xiao Beiming,

525
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,640
trapped in it without realizing it.

526
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,330
But time is running out.

527
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,400
Any suspicious point

528
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,110
could be

529
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,510
the key to finding Yesha.

530
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,470
If we suspect Yesha every time

531
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,270
there's a murder in the capital,

532
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,680
our Secret Investigation Unit

533
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,080
wouldn't be able to keep up

534
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,590
even with superhuman powers.

535
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,160
Being so impatient for results

536
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,070
will only let Xiao Beiming

537
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,590
lead you by the nose.

538
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,350
Calm down and think it through.

539
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,640
As General Huo's daughter,

540
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,960
you're not keeping vigil
at the mourning hall.

541
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,960
Instead, you're here
at the training ground.

542
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,880
No lamps,

543
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,270
but armed with weapons.

544
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,480
No matter how I look at it, Miss Huo,

545
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,400
you seem to be doing

546
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,660
something dangerous.

547
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,920
It seems you're not
an ordinary woman either.

548
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,720
That's right.

549
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,240
My father died suddenly,

550
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,160
with many suspicious circumstances.

551
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,620
I came here to investigate

552
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,310
the cause of my father's death as well.

553
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,310
Don't be afraid.

554
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,150
As long as you stay quiet,

555
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,310
I won't hurt you.

556
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,200
You're Zhong Xueman.

557
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,240
Although you're wearing this robe,

558
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,690
the boots on your feet

559
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:04,820
are official boots.

560
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,030
In the entire Qi Kingdom,

561
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,440
women who can wear official boots

562
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,840
are already rare enough,

563
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,750
and those with such martial skills

564
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,920
are even rarer.

565
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,880
If I'm not mistaken,

566
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,080
that weapon in your hand

567
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,920
is the legendary Bi'an Sword, isn't it?

568
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,950
-You…
-Don’t think too much.

569
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:23,920
I've always been

570
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,250
interested in criminal investigations.

571
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,160
I just know

572
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,110
a bit more than others, that's all.

573
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,200
I've heard plenty of stories

574
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,640
about the Elite Constabulary Unit.

575
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,240
Judging by your reaction,

576
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,680
I must be right.

577
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,450
Since we have the same goal,

578
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,210
why don't we work together?

579
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,310
You don't even know my intentions,

580
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,340
yet you're willing to trust
an outsider like me?

581
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,510
Compared to you,

582
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,480
in this entire house,

583
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,210
I have no one else to trust.

584
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,240
Besides,

585
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,400
I want to see

586
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,180
if the famous Zhong Xueman

587
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,800
is really as good as they say.

588
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,360
If my father had secrets,

589
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,070
they must be hidden in his bedroom.

590
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,270
If Constable Zhong wants to investigate,

591
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:08,000
[Noble Character, Pure Integrity]

592
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,680
I can show you the way.

593
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,880
Have you heard?

594
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,160
General Huo will be buried tomorrow.

595
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:21,880
Tomorrow?

596
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,920
That's too fast.

597
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,750
Shouldn't the body
lie in state for seven days?

598
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,400
Yes,

599
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,080
but I heard

600
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:26,920
it was decided by Madam

601
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,180
and senior disciples.

602
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,270
I see.

603
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,160
Tomorrow?

604
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,720
That's not right.

605
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,880
Boss, you're right.

606
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,960
There must be something suspicious

607
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,490
about Huo Zongyao's death.

608
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,440
Where's Xueman?

609
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,840
Hasn't she returned yet?

610
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,880
Why did you two split up?

611
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:43,880
I...

612
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,610
I'll go find her.

613
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,270
Help!

614
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,000
Go!

615
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:51,400
Go!

616
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:55,510
Go!

617
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,240
Madam, are you hurt?

618
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:10,920
I was just

619
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:15,770
[General Huo's wife, Mrs. Huo]

620
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,880
sorting through Master's belongings

621
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,810
when this person suddenly broke in

622
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,250
and tried to assault me.

623
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,270
You brazen thief!

624
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,880
How dare you break into
the Huo Mansion at night?

625
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,080
Sorting belongings?

626
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,510
Then why were you lying on the bed

627
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,240
with your clothes disheveled?

628
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:23,750
You...

629
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,510
You're a woman!

630
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,920
Boss, I'll go help her.

631
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,570
Don't be reckless.

632
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,000
Boss.

633
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,070
We can't just

634
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,730
leave Constable Zhong there.

635
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,690
Tong Shuang.

636
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,030
You go.

637
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,510
Who are you?

638
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,160
What do you want at the Huo Mansion?

639
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,790
I'm Zhong Xueman
from the Elite Constabulary Unit.

640
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,190
I'm here to investigate.

641
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,110
Clever.

642
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,270
Let's go.

643
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,790
Let's go.

644
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,830
You claim to be from
the Elite Constabulary Unit.

645
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,090
What proof do you have?

646
00:27:59,110 --> 00:27:59,880
I have proof.

647
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,310
Just as I thought, an impostor.

648
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,030
Guards!

649
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,110
Stop!

650
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,790
There is indeed a female constable
in the Elite Constabulary Unit.

651
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,070
She is the daughter
of King Zhong of Constables,

652
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,000
Zhong Xueman.

653
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,200
Zhong Xueman.

654
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,350

have also been torn up.

658
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,370
Someone definitely doesn't want us

659
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:36,110
to discover what happened back then.

660
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,160
Mr. Miao was killed
at Fengbo Lake 3 years ago

Now only General Huo is still alive.

[The Dossier of the Imperial Secretariat]
[Huo Zongyao's Dossier]

00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,880
What exactly happened

665
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,960
in the 36th year of Ningtai?

Young Master.

Prepare the horses.

669
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,270
It's late. Where are you going?

670
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,720
Bad news!

671
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:56,880

Speak.

Master's dead body.

675
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,790
Where are the guards in the mourning hall?

676

They all came here.

677
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:04,790
This is bad.

678
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,280
It's a diversion tactic.

679
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:08,000

Wait.

687
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,720
Is this what you call a good plan?

688
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,000
With Xueman's position
in the Elite Constabulary Unit

689

the Huo family

691

won't harm her.

As long as we have

Huo Zongyao's body in our possession,

694

we can exchange it for her.

695
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,480
But why do we have to
use the body for the exchange?

696
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,160
Because this body

697
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,690
definitely holds secrets.

Yes, in my box.

Take the lighter

Why is this different from before?

The poison has run out.

754

That's just mosquito repellent,

No injuries anywhere on his body,

How is that possible?

842

Impossible.

843

I suspect General Huo's death

844
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,490
is connected to the Yesha case.

845

What nonsense are you talking about?

General Huo's body here

is to uncover the truth.

849
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,840
According to the laws of the Qi Kingdom,

850
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,760
whenever a military or political official

851
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,190
of the fifth rank or above

852
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,400

853
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,820

00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,190
the Ministry of Justice has the authority
to conduct a thorough investigation.

856
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,440
Since General Huo's death

857
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,630
involves clues to the Yesha case,

858
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,140
then today,

859
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,630
Constable Zhong's actions are simply

00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,190
following the law.

861
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,640
That was in the past.

862
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,590
Chief Fang.

863
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,630
Nowadays, all major cases in the capital

864
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,190
fall under the jurisdiction
of the Secret Investigation Unit.

865
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,320
Even if an investigation is needed,

866
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,190
it should be conducted by
the Secret Investigation Unit.

867
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,710
What authority
does your Elite Constabulary Unit have?

868
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,590
What did you say?

869
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,190
What did you say?

870
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,360
How dare you say that?

871
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,150
Try saying that again.

872
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,400
If I'm not mistaken,

873
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,760
I request that the Elite Constabulary Unit

874
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,480
hand over my master's body

875
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,030
and charge Zhong Xueman.

876
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,140
Yes, that's right.

877
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,630
Who called for
the Secret Investigation Unit?

878
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:10,830
Since only the Secret Investigation Unit
can investigate,

879
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:12,830
we might as well comply.

880
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,920
No wonder you are Constable Zhong.

881
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,730
You discovered the suspicious points

882
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,590
in General Huo's case so quickly.

883
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,550
It really surprised and delighted me.

884
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,110
Zhuge Kongyun is here.

885
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,400
If he discovers you,

886
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:29,840
it

887
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,710
will cause serious trouble.

888
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,850
What do you mean?

889
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,190
Indeed.

890
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,150
I discovered that General Huo's death

891
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,000
might be suspicious.

892
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:45,840
But due to the mourning period
at the Huo Mansion,

893
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,280
I asked Constable Zhong

894
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,340
to secretly investigate

895
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,610
General Huo's body.

896
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,160
Causing such a commotion

897
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,890
was due to my poor planning.

898
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:53,960
I

899
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:56,990
apologize to everyone from the Huo family.

900
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,440
The Secret Investigation Unit

901
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,500
would actually work with
the Elite Constabulary Unit?

902
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,070
Do I need you to teach me

903
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,290
how we should be doing things
at our Secret Investigation Unit?

904
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,190
That's right!

905
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,590
The Secret Investigation Unit

906
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:25,400
and the Elite Constabulary Unit
both belong to the Ministry of Justice.

907
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,670
We work closely together on a daily basis.

908
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,480
And now when facing a suspicious case,

909
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,010
we should be
even more united in our response.

910
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:35,710
Untie her now!

911
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,440
I think

912
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:47,280
the autopsy is almost done.

913
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,510
Constable Zhong.

914
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,000
Ask the people inside

915
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,400
to open the door.

916
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,400
I'm helping you out of this situation,

917
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,960
so at least make it easier for me.

918
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,440
If we continue this standoff,

919
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,100
neither of us
will be able to explain ourselves.

920
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,920
Constable Zhong,

921
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:11,960
please.
