We're all colleagues
at the Ministry of Justice.

175
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,020
Constable Zhong said

176
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,980
that someone would come to question me,

177
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,840
and that would be you, Chief Fang?

178
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:56,700
Where is she?

179
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,450
Where is she?

180
00:08:58,930 --> 00:08:59,600
I'm here.

181
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,330
Chief.

182
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,110
Director Blue Cat.

183
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,850
Xiao Beiming.

184
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,550
Chief...

185
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,530
Well, this is a first.

186
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,110
A Ministry of Justice official is going to

187
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,900
be interrogated by a prisoner.

188
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,300
Director Blue Cat,

189
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,800
you misunderstand.

190
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,260
He is only here to observe.

191
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,910
We need his confirmation

192
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,290
regarding some details of the case
and the evidence.

193
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,380
Today, Constable Zhong and I

194
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,470
have invited you here

195
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,900
solely to seek your guidance

196
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,470
on the case.

197
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,890
Then what exactly do you want to ask me?

198
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,010
Director Blue Cat, you're straightforward.

199
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,210
Then, I'll be direct.

200
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,140
There  is a key criminal

201
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,140
named Huang Wuchang

202
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,650
who was rescued during transport.

203
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,850
We'd like to inquire about this matter.

204
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,590
And what does that

205
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,550
have to do with me?

206
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,230
The carrier pigeons used
by the Secret Investigation Unit

207
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,630
come from your dovecote.

208
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:11,840
So, you're saying

209
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,390
that information was leaked

210
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,410
from my dovecote?

211
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,230
Of course,

212
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,860
we're not suspecting you,
Director Blue Cat.

213
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,850
We both know

214
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:21,750
that the dovecote is actually

215
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:24,070
[Nest of Returning Wings]

216
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,040
our country's intelligence agency.

217
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,020
And you are

218
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,320
the director of the agency.

219
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,890
Stealing secrets from the dovecote

220
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,490
would be nearly impossible.

221
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,480
But...

222
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,060
is there a chance that the pigeons

223
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,490
could be intercepted during delivery?

224
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,730
Chief Zhuge and his son

225
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,120
are no ordinary people.

226
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,230
They have their own

227
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,800
unique methods of sealing messages.

228
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,990
If the messages were opened midway,

229
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,190
do you think they would not notice?

230
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,430
Our pigeons

231
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,090
are specially trained.

232
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,180
It would be very difficult

233
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,330
to tamper with them.

234
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,890
You're overthinking this.

235
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:57,950
I suggest that you

236
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,960
try a different approach
in your investigation.

237
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,540
This topic ends here.

238
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,690
I should go now.

239
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,520
Director Blue Cat,

240
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,050
since you're already here,

241
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,240
why not dine here

242
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,750
before heading back?

243
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,960
I've told you everything I can.

244
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,380
The dovecote has strict rules.

245
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,380
My coming to the Elite Constabulary Unit

246
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,640
has already broken them,

247
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,120
and I've shown enough courtesy.

248
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,360
Chief Fang, please understand.

249
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,220
I understand. I understand.

250
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,530
Director Blue Cat,

251
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,070
Huang Wuchang has committed
numerous crimes

252
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,370
and must be captured as soon as possible.

253
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,860
Please help us, Director Blue Cat.

254
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,600
This matter doesn't concern me.

255
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,380
I'm only responsible for
gathering intelligence

256
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,040
and taking care of my pigeons.

257
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,190
Please wait.

258
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,390
Director Blue Cat,

259
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,790
I've heard some fascinating folk tales.

260
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,850
They say that in the eastern seas
of the Qi Kingdom,

261
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,470
there's a small island
with an ancient tribe

262
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,470
that has lived for generations

263
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,070
raising and training birds.

264
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,330
The thumbs of their people

265
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,350
are different from ordinary people'sâ€”

266
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,210
exceptionally long and slender.

267
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,870
Just now, I noticed that your thumb

268
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,270
exhibits the same trait.

269
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,710
Could the rumors be true?

270
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,330
That's not just a rumor.

271
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,690
I'm indeed a member of
the Bird Tamer Tribe.

272
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,820
So the Bird Tamer Tribe really exists.

273
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,380
What about the Eastern Sea Kingdom?

274
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,930
They wanted our tribe

275
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,190
to become their spies,

276
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,940
working exclusively for them.

277
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,530
When we refused,

278
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:18,490
they slaughtered

279
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,140
our entire tribe.

280
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,110
I escaped by sheer luck

281
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,640
and fled to the Qi Kingdom,

282
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,570
where I've been living ever since.

283
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,700
I see.

284
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,840
Director Blue Cat,

285
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:35,780
may I ask how life is for you here

286
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,180
in the Qi Kingdom?

287
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,340
Very well.

288
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,000
The imperial court has taken good care
of me,

289
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,840
and I have family and friends now.

290
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,190
Why do you ask?

291
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,460
Director Blue Cat,

292
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,660
Huang Wuchang is

293
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,810
a complete madman.

294
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:55,810
We've discovered
that he's been orchestrating

295
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:56,870
a massive conspiracy.

296
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,470
If his conspiracy succeeds,

297
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,090
countless people in the Qi Kingdom

298
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,280
will lose their homes and families.

299
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,650
The common people are innocent.

300
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,700
You've experienced loss,

301
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,670
so you must understand

302
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,070
that feeling of despair.

303
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,290
Director Blue Cat,

304
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:11,660
please, for the sake of

305
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,460
all the people of the Qi Kingdom,

306
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,780
help us.

307
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:25,330
Fine.

308
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:26,550
I admit

309
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:29,060
that I did keep something from you.

310
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,670
Actually,

311
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:32,690
the dovecote keeps a copy

312
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,820
of everything written on the messages

313
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,330
delivered by the pigeons.

314
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,510
In other words,

315
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,940
if I wish to,

316
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,680
I can know everything.

317
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,370
But didn't you say
that many pigeon messages

318
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,040
are sealed in special ways?

319
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,600
We have techniques passed down
through generations

320
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,930
that allow us to view
the contents of messages

321
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,460
without leaving any trace.

322
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:51,950
Don't misunderstand.

323
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,070
That's the Intelligence Agency's duty.

324
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,740
The monitoring is to

325
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,680
prevent greater disasters.

326
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,160
The imperial court permits this

327
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,940
because Director Blue Cat's loyalty

328
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,470
has been proven beyond doubt.

329
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,870
What I'm trying to say is,

330
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:05,890
although I've seen

331
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,120
the correspondence
between Chief Zhuge and his son,

332
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,680
I don't know the specific contents.

333
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,360
[Secret Letter]

334
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,480
Because they wrote in code,

335
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,770
which requires a codebook

336
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,180
to decipher.

337
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,230
You mean

338
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,950
the people who rescued Huang Wuchang

339
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,810
cracked the Zhuge family's code?

340
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,080
How is that possible?

341
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,440
Of course, it's possible.

342
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,150
Pigeon message intelligence holds value,

343
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,630
so naturally, there are people out there

344
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,810
who specialize in
collecting and decoding it.

345
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:28,630
It has even become

346
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,730
a business.

347
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,770
There's such a business?

348
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:32,770
Indeed, there is.

349
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,190
In the martial world, there are people
who collect

350
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,490
intelligence from pigeon messagesâ€”

351
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,890
they're called Book Merchants.

352
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:38,790
Then there are others

353
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,300
who decode the obtained intelligence

354
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,130
and transcribe it,

355
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,060
called Scribes.

356
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:44,980
Those who trade in intelligence are called
Book Collectors.

357
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,340
Chief Fang is right.

358
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,030
The people who rescued Huang Wuchang

359
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,870
must be connected to this group.

360
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,280
I've investigated them before.

361
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,590
They frequently appear around
Sibao Street.

362
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,350
Perhaps you could go there

363
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,380
and try your luck.

364
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,740
There is a copy of the correspondence

365
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,340
between Chief Zhuge and his son
in the dovecote.

00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,360
I'll have someone deliver it to you later.

367
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,630
I hope it'll be helpful

368
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,060
for your investigation.

For the sake of the people here,

375
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,700
I implore you

to ensure that Huang Wuchang is

377
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,640

378
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,240
We will.

Also,

380

I don't believe that someone

who could say what you just said

382
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,730
could possibly be the cold-blooded killer

The young master isn't used to

the food from the prison kitchen,

390
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,470
so he asked me to
buy something from outside.

391
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,050
He's locked up

392

and still has so many demands.

393
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:26,880
Chief,

394
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,600
keeping him locked up like this
isn't a solution.

395

After all, we've arrested Xiao Beiming.

396

How about

397
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,080
we go plead with His Majesty

398

to have the Young Master released sooner?

If we can't solve the Yesha case,

401
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,450
you might need to prepare

402

I can't even make sense of it.

408
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,390
That's exactly the idea.

409
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,690
Once we translate it using the codebook,

410
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:01,690
it'll make sense.

411
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,680
So we still have to find the codebook.

412

I've rested enough.

Let me tell you,

518
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,130
this isn't like your daily street patrols

Alright, alright.

524

I'll tell you what,

525
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:32,480
I was just testing you

526
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,510
to see if those three years at the morgue

527
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,570
had made you rusty.

528
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:35,790
Looks like you've built up
quite a bit of energy.

529

That puts my mind at ease.

I'll take the top of the street!

533
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,730
I said I'll take the top of the street,

534

Why go to all this trouble?

567
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,740
Is it because you're old friends

wrap your head around this?

If Beiming were really Yesha,

573

would we need to ask for your help?

Our chief said

577
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,120
that Xiao Beiming is
cunning and deceitful,

578
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,070
and everything he does

579
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,230
is just to throw people off the scent.

Exactly.

If you ask me,

597
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,470
we should do what we did last time:

knock him out,

599

have Miss Huo disguise me,

and then infiltrate
the Secret Investigation Unit.

Even with disguises, we can't get in.

608

they're certainly not to be
underestimated.

So, spare us the nonsense

746
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,060
and tell us how you usually

747
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,260
obtain information and intelligence.

748
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:18,180
Sometimes I buy information,

749
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,630
but most of the time

750
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,680
we intercept carrier pigeons.

751
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,220
But the pigeons from the dovecote

752
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,700
are all specially trained.

753
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,700
How do you manage to intercept them?

754
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,800
They let the pigeons out

755
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,350
for exercise every day.

756
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,550
Someone would scatter feed

757
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,600
near the dovecote

758
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:34,890
to lure the pigeons.

759
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,270
But those pigeons are quite smart.

760
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,320
They don't easily eat food from outside.

761
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,440
However, the bait we make

762
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,640
is very similar to

763
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,010
what they're fed at the dovecote.

764
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:44,870
Eventually, we managed to

765
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:46,110
lure them to eat it.

766
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,150
Over time,

767
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,830
those message-carrying pigeons

768
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,760
would fly off course to us instead.

00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,270
That's how the contents

770

not worth much at all.

00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,020
from the Secret Investigation Unit,

In our line of work,

785
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,650
we can't just sell out others.

786
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:17,850

787
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:20,130
I'd be dead the moment I stepped outside!

I won't talk.

793
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,400
I'm dead either way.

794
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,790
Dead if I leave, dead if I stay.

795
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,320
I-I choose to die here then.

-Come on.

Come on.

798
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:41,190
-Come on.
-Hurry up, hurry up!

799
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,250

800
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:42,780

801
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,790
This is the lightest one.

802
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:48,880

803
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,610

I have something to say!

811

No need, no need.

814
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:15,040
I'll say it on my knees.

Stand up.

816
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,540
Alright.

817
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:18,620
Well...

818
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,740
not long ago, I heard

819
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,640
that a Book Merchant

820
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,390
intercepted the intelligence
from the Secret Investigation Unit.

821
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:24,920
He's a veteran in our trade,

822
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,270
but I've only heard about him.

823
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,580
I've never met the man!

824
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,350
Where did he send the intelligence?

825
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,550
And who is the Scribe?

826
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,270
They say

827
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,870
he usually works as a Book Merchant

828
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,330
and also works as a Scribe.

829
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,680
He even knows how to interpret codes.

830
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,520
I figure

831
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,340
this person must be

832
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,240
personally in contact with

833
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,970
those Book Collectors higher up the chain.

834
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:43,090
He rarely buys information from others

835
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:44,230
and mostly does the scribing.

836
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,580
And the information he releases
is always related to

837
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,380
murder cases handled by the government.

838
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,550
So there's been

839
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,050
a rumor circulating outside

840
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,010
that this person

841
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,420
works in the Ministry of Justice.

842
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,490
Don't look at me like that, officers.

843
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,730
I... I really

844
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,520
don't know anything else.

845
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,320
I've told you everything I know.

What are Zhong Xueman
and the others doing?

849
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,150

852
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,590
was it worth handing Xiao Beiming

853
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:48,330
over to the Elite Constabulary Unit

854
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,290
and putting yourself

855
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:50,500
in such a...

856
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:52,990
dire situation?

857
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,190
Of course it was.

858
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,690
But the Elite Constabulary Unit
and our Secret Investigation Unit

859
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:02,860
are sworn enemies after all.

860
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,450
Didn't you just

861
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,380
help the Elite Constabulary Unit?

862
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:07,100
Those pointless conflicts

863
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,350
are far less important

864
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,110
than human lives and the truth.

865
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,220
But Xiao Beiming is Yesha after all.

866
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,140
That hasn't been confirmed yet.

867
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,260
Haven't you been asking me

868
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,010
why, even though I discovered him

869
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:20,810
by Zhong Xueman's side long ago,

870
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,010
I delayed arresting him?

871
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:24,980
That's right.

872
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:27,220
His Majesty issued an edict long ago:

873
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,420
if we can't catch him,

874
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:31,010
both you and the Chief will be beheaded.

875
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,930
Why did you not only not arrest him

876
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:35,900
but also deliberately let him escape
several times?

877
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,810
Because in this world,

878
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,700
apart from Zhong Xueman,

879
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,670
the person who least wants him to be Yesha

880
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:49,100
might be me.

881
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:49,860
But...

882
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:51,820
but haven't you always

883
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,590
disliked Xiao Beiming, Young Master?

884
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:54,110
Yes.

885
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,110
I detest him.

886
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:58,310
I detest that he's smarter than me,

887
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,570
more decisive than me,

888
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:01,170
â™ª An elegant gentleman â™ª

889
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,800
and better at solving cases than me.

890
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,120
â™ª Beauty, yet prejudice â™ª

891
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:03,240
If there's anyone in this world

892
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,760
who wants him dead the most,

893
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,130
â™ª With courage â™ª

894
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,530
it's probably me too.

895
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:06,770
â™ª The gentleman understands â™ª

896
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,100
I don't understand.

897
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,090
â™ª Traveling freely in this world â™ª

898
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:12,030
That's the contradiction of human nature.

899
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:16,450
â™ª Only wielding his sword â™ª

900
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,930
The person you detest the most

901
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,040
could also be

902
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,530
the one you admire the most.

903
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,750
â™ª I cry alone â™ª

904
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:20,710
The one you most wish

905
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,850
â™ª Grieving over past grievances â™ª

906
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:22,120
to see disgraced...

907
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,070
â™ª Thinking about you again and again â™ª

908
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,820
could also be

909
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:26,850
the one whose name

910
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,430
â™ª It's just one glance â™ª

911
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,480
you most want to see cleared.

912
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,160
The one you most want dead

913
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:34,130
â™ª And I can't sleep at night â™ª

914
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:32,740
could also be...

915
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,630
the one you most want

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,340
â™ª Crossing mountains and seas
isn't impossible â™ª

917
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,060
to keep alive.

918
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,070
If he really is Yesha,

â™ª The wind sweeps

920
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:41,810
then wouldn't I,

921
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:43,310
who have been chasing after him
all this time,

â™ª Fear no storm, be free â™ª

923
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,350
be the biggest fool

924
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:46,430

â™ª Bloodshed â™ª

926
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,410
But there's also no evidence to prove

927
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:49,550
that he isn't Yesha.

928
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,060
â™ª Crossing mountains and seas
isn't impossible â™ª

929
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,590
That's right.

930
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,880
There is indeed no evidence to prove

931
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:57,450
â™ª The wind sweeps
past the young man with a sword â™ª

932
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,040
that he isn't Yesha.

933
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,910
The Chief always tells me

934
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,080
that solving cases requires evidence

935
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:01,090
â™ª Fear no storm, be free â™ª

936
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:01,370
and catching criminals requires evidence.

â™ª Bloodshed â™ª

938
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,760
But sometimes,

939
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:04,660
so-called evidence

940
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,010
is just a lie that blinds us.

941
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:07,990
â™ª In this cold world â™ª

942
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,550
The moment he appeared
at the execution ground,

943
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:10,000
â™ª So pitiful, have you ever â™ª

944
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,130
â™ª Believed in forever? â™ª

945
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,810
I looked into his eyes,

946
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:15,370
and I knew I was right.

947

If

951
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:22,280
he were truly

952
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,810

â™ª I cry alone â™ª

954
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,560
how could he risk his life

955
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,670
for personal feelings?

956
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:29,449
â™ª Grieving over past grievances â™ª

957
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:29,719
And how could he have

958
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:30,889
a group of friends willing

959
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:32,710
â™ª Thinking about you again and again â™ª

960
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:31,480
to stand up for him,

961
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,280
regardless of their own safety?

962
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,210
â™ª It's just one glance â™ª

963
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,670
So, he definitely isn't Yesha.

964
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,699

00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:53,810

I can truly call a friend.

I don't understand,

990

I never said any of this today.

00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,060
What do you want?

1024
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,490
Don't get physical.

1025
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:01,880
You know that book?

1026
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,860
Who doesn't know it?

1027
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,870
It's about a general
from the previous dynasty

1028
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:07,270
hunting down pirates.

1029
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:08,820
How do you know about it?

1030
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:14,910
There's a storyteller

1031
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:16,480
at the Bao Yi Xing Teahouse.

1032
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,650
He often tells stories

1033
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:19,090
from the book.

1034
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:19,890
I've heard

1035
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:21,270
that the book has been
out of print for years,

1036
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,500
so in the entire capital,

1037
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,720
he's the only one
who knows the stories in it.

1038
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,550
Many of our men have gone to listen.

1039
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:27,390
If someone is really using the book

1040
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:29,120
as some kind of code reference,

1041
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:31,130
they'd definitely have to go to him.

1042
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,380
Earlier today,
that Book Merchant confessed

1043
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,030
that there's a very suspicious Scribeâ€”

1044
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,910
possibly someone
from the Ministry of Justice.

1045
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:37,790
So,

1046
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,290
there really is a traitor among us?

1047
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:43,370
Then, Constable Fang,

1048
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,280
please help us and go check it out.

1049
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:47,550
What?

1050
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,620
Are you ordering me around now?

1051
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,620
Is that a problem?

1052
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,050
Fine.

1053
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,300
Same as usual.

1054
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,340
Eat while it's hot.

1055
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:02,940
I'm on it.

1056
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,570
Mr. Wang!

1057
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:11,920
Constable Fang,

1058
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,710
what brings you here?

1059
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,230
I have something
I'd like to ask you about.

1060
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:16,840
Go ahead.

1061
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,050
Have you recently

1062
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,890
let anyone else copy your rare edition of

1063
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:21,150
Chronicle of
Pacifying Pirates in the Eastern Sea?

1064
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:23,360
Especially someone like me, a constable?

1065
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,630
Let me think.

1066
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,500
Hardly anyone even knows to come to me

1067
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,730
for the book.

1068
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,510
I remember now.

1069
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,950
There really was such a person

1070
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:35,010
who came to copy it.

1071
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,670
You should be quite familiar with him.

1072
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,120
It was Constable Jiang

1073
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,570
from your Elite Constabulary Unit.

1074
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:41,530
No one else besides him.

1075
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,410
Yi?
