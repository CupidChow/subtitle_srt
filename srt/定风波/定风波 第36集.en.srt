[The Wanted Detective]

2
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,700
[Episode 36]

3
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,509
Hurry up.

4
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,120
This is the place.

5
00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:52,370
We've been here before.

6
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,229
This is where the goods shop

7
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:54,640
delivered the Bosuo Flowers.

8
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,640
There's nothing left inside.

9
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,020
This is just the entrance.

10
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:57,690
The entrance?

11
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,060
There's a hidden chamber inside,

12
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,260
and a secret passage.

13
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,870
In this house,

14
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,890
there's a hole behind the closet.

15
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,560
That hole

16
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,080
is dug deep and wide.

17
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,520
The entrance is right here,

18
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,400
and the exit

19
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,410
is over there,

20
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,810
in that courtyard by Fengbo Lake

21
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,120
where there are

22
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,030
three willow trees.

23
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,950
Three trees?

24
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,610
You mean the courtyard

25
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,070
next to Dingfeng Pavilion?

26
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,710
So it's near Dingfeng Pavilion,

27
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,079
hidden right under our noses?

28
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:22,000
At that time,
we were wanted throughout the city.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,870
While searching for Miao Yun,

30
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,120
we hid in Dingfeng Pavilion.

31
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,280
At that time, Chief Zhuge

32
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,280
protected us

33
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:26,940
by avoiding this area

34
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,900
during his patrols.

35
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,030
So up to now,

36
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,090
this place has never been inspected.

37
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,470
For wanted criminals,

38
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,520
this is the safest place

39
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,079
in the entire capital.

40
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,000
Darn it.

41
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,760
I can't believe we've been helping him.

42
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,680
Li Long.

43
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,630
Take some men and surround

44
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,800
from the courtyard outside Fengbo Lake.

45
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,030
We'll go in from the inside,

46
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,020
and we'll attack from both sides.

47
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,960
We must catch him.

48
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,430
Yes.

49
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,370
Let's go. Hurry up.

50
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,400
Come on.

51
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:49,960
Let's go.

52
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,310
Master.

53
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,680
I have failed you.

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,970
In the end, I wasn't able to kill

55
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,030
that Taoist Yunji.

56
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:58,540
This place

57
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,680
is about to be exposed.

58
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,480
We should retreat immediately.

59
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,710
It's too late.

60
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,910
They should be

61
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,470
standing right

62
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,890
above us now.

63
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,520
The exit by Fengbo Lake

64
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,190
must have also been surrounded.

65
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,870
Master.

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,680
You leave first,

67
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,710
and I'll hold them off.

68
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,190
You take them and leave first.

69
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,120
Absolutely not!

70
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,150
If you stay here

71
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,240
and something happens,

72
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:18,560
that'll...

73
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,630
Don't worry.

74
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,910
Everything is going as I planned.

75
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,840
Thank you, Taoist Yunji.

76
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,750
It's dangerous here.

77
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,910
You should leave first.

78
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,800
Thank you all for saving my life.

79
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,120
If you successfully capture Yesha,

80
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,430
I won't charge a penny

81
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,520
and will perform for three days straight

82
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,120
to celebrate your success.

83
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:46,710
Deal.

84
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,690
Thanks a lot.

85
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,519
Everyone, be careful.

86
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,270
You're here.

87
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,120
Stay alert.

88
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,840
You said we would meet again,

89
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,210
and I wouldn't dare miss our appointment.

90
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,400
It seems I've underestimated you.

91
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,290
You have nowhere to escape now.

92
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,909
Hand over the Swift Wind Pill

93
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,040
and come back with us.

94
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,870
Go back?

95
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,159
Where to?

96
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,070
The Elite Constabulary Unit
or the Heavenly Prison?

97
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,510
Too bad I've been to both.

98
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,560
There was nothing you could do to me.

99
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,980
You just had to watch me

100
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,250
walk away, didn't you?

101
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,510
We've seen through your tricks.

102
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,720
Do you think

103
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,520
we'd fall for them again?

104
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,310
Then guess,

105
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,950
why would I let Taoist Yunji

106
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,920
see this place,

107
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,630
and why would I be here

108
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,680
waiting for you?

109
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,600
Right.

110
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,360
I did say I underestimated you,

111
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,560
but I never said

112
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,950
you could win.

113
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:35,870
Do it!

114
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,120
You guys

115
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,750
are such a nuisance.

116
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,600
I'll let you out

117
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,730
once I'm done with what I need to do.

118
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:02,800
When the time comes,

119
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,720
I'll let you see with your own eyes

120
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,500
that everything you try to protect

121
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,180
will cease to exist,

122
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,710
and the entire Qi Kingdom

123
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,690
will be completely transformed.

124
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,870
Bastard!

125
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,480
I remember when we first came in,

126
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,150
I felt many currents of air

127
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,159
blowing from different directions.

128
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,159
This underground secret passage

129
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,560
must be interconnected,

130
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,010
with more than one exit.

131
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,800
That is to say

132
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,750
our men above

133
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:44,290
have no chance of capturing him at all.

134
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,070
All our men from
the Elite Constabulary Unit

135
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,830
and the Secret Investigation Unit

136
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,070
are focused on this place,

137
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,040
which in turn gave them

138
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,800
the opportunity to commit their crime.

139
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,659
We've all fallen into their trap!

140
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,040
Check out these bricks.

141
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,200
These are bricks
fired in an official kiln.

142
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,270
This place was probably not

143
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,390
dug out by them,

144
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,750
but was originally part

145
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,830
of the Qi Kingdom.

146
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,950
This is an abandoned underground waterway.

147
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,070
The underground waterways
of the Qi Kingdom

148
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:24,870
were built very spacious

149
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,950
for flood discharge,

150
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,240
even navigable by boat.

151
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,570
With Gong Fu by his side,

152
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,750
he can now easily control
the entire underground waterway system

153
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,190
of the Qi Kingdom.

154
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,430
He just said

155
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,430
he'd destroy everything

156
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,159
we try to protect.

157
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,360
His final plan

158
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,630
is probably to use
the underground waterways

159
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,870
to infect the entire population
of the Qi Kingdom

160
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,070
with the pill poison.

161
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,810
That's impossible.

162
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,680
He can't possibly

163
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,800
execute such a plan.

164
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,430
Although the capital

165
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,750
is filled with underground waterways,

166
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,510
the drinking water channels
are separate from each other,

167
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,070
and the wells

168
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,480
between different streets

169
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,950
are also not connected.

170
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,190
I understand now.

171
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,430
It is exactly to prevent

172
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,000
someone from poisoning the water

173
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,460
and contaminating the entire water supply.

174
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,630
If he wants to poison

175
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,000
the entire population,

176
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,240
he would need to connect

177
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,870
all the drinking water channels
of every street.

178
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,600
That would require
enormous manpower and resources.

179
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,460
He can't possibly accomplish it.

180
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,000
Do you still remember

181
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,870
the customs of
the Heaven Worship Ceremony?

182
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,870
What's with that?

183
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,040
The palace never uses well water
for drinking.

184
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,390
The water His Majesty drinks

185
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,240
is all sourced from

186
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,170
the Imperial Spring in the palace.

187
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,430
That water is sweet,

188
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,810
and after each Heaven Worship Ceremony,

189
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:30,730
His Majesty

190
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,250
would bestow this sweet dew to the people,

191
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,710
which is giving the water
from the Imperial Spring

192
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,840
to the common folks.

193
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,480
I remember it now.

194
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,200
There's a shallow well

195
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,840
on every main street in the capital

196
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,200
called the Blessing Well.

197
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,080
But those wells are normally dry.

198
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,000
Only after each
annual Heaven Worship Ceremony

199
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,080
does sweet spring water appear in them.

200
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,630
At that time, all the citizens

201
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,750
bring their bowls

202
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,600
to drink a bowl of
this so-called sweet dew.

203
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,150
These wells

204
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,240
are specially built water channels

205
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,080
that all lead back to the Imperial Spring.

206
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,440
If Yesha poisons the Imperial Spring

207
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,790
through the underground waterways,

208
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,480
then...

209
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,900
The entire Qi Kingdom will be doomed.

210
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,480
They're traveling by water,

211
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,600
so they probably haven't gone far.

212
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,060
Let's find a way out first.

213
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,240
The mechanism's connection points
are the weakest.

214
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,720
Perhaps we can try here!

215
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,200
Are you alright?

216
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,790
This won't do.

217
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,000
Before you break through the gate,

218
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,600
you'll exhaust yourselves.

219
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,100
Everyone, step aside.

220
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,840
It's working.

221
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,670
You took the Swift Wind Pill?

222
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,960
Zhong Xueman!

223
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,840
Are you insane?

224
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,270
There's no antidote
for the Swift Wind Pill.

225
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,200
Xueman...

226
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,650
I know
the Swift Wind Pill is highly toxic,

227
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,840
but before the poison takes effect,

228
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,270
it gives ordinary people

229
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,080
several times

230
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,650
their normal strength.

231
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,200
I took three.

232
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,910
With my internal energy,

233
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,970
I'll definitely be able to
break this place open.

234
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,270
Zhong Xueman, you...

235
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,480
Beiming.

236
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,130
You once said that as a constable,

237
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,440
one should be prepared

238
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,030
to sacrifice at any time,

239
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,510
because there are people

240
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,000
we must protect.

241
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,550
This is the principle you taught me
since I was little,

242
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,480
isn't it?

243
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,150
Constable Zhong.

244
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,320
-Xueman!
-Constable Zhong!

245
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,720
-Xueman!
-Zhong Xueman.

246
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,670
Xueman.

247
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,080
Are you okay?

248
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,410
You go find them first.

249
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,480
I'll stay here with her.

250
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,030
But...

251
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,270
But...

252
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,650
Don't let her sacrifice be in vain.

253
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,200
Go save them.

254
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,750
He's right.

255
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,550
Let's go.

256
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,870
Beiming.

257
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,080
You need to go stop Yesha.

258
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,750
Don't stay here.

259
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,320
I'm not going.

260
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,860
You should trust them.

261
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,820
I'm staying here with you.

262
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:35,840
I'm afraid.

263
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,870
I'm afraid that
after the poison takes effect,

264
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,390
I won't remember you,

265
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,750
and I might hurt you.

266
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:46,600
It won't happen.

267
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,630
You'll be okay.

268
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,480

I still have plenty of time.

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,930
did you get to partake of the water?

349
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,550
Of course I did.

350
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,960
The water from the Blessing Well

351
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,790
was so sweet.

352
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,680
Everyone in the capital,

353
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,610
young and old, had to have a taste.

354
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,000
So how are you feeling?

355
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,170
Any discomfort?

356
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,680
What kind of question is that?

357
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,750
Drinking the sweet dew brings longevity.

358
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,830
I'm perfectly fine,

359
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,920
no discomfort whatsoever.

360
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,680
Go away.

361
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,160
Don't disturb my fishing.

362
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,690
What kind of person is this?

363
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:51,830
You lost.

364
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,970
What exactly happened?

365
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,920
The poison has been neutralized.

366
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,000
No one in the capital has been poisoned.

367
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,350
Your plan has failed.

368
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,720
That's impossible.

369
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,200
The Swift Wind Pill poison

370
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,510
couldn't be cured even by
the Unstoppable Old Man.

371
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,310
How did you manage

372
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,240
to neutralize it in just a few days?

373
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,270
Beiming...

374
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,070
The Blood-freezing Frost?

375
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:51,790
Back then, Old Bug

376
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,240
modified my meridians with gold needles

377
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,270
and forced the frost toxin in my body

378
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,720
into a dormant meridian.

379
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,510
Actually, the antidote
to the Swift Wind Pill

380
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,370
has been inside my body all along.

381
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,440
That's why

382
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,270
Old Bug, fully aware

383
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,510
that taking the Swift Wind Pill
meant certain death,

384
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,310
still chose

385
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,480
to use it to escape his predicament.

386
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,080
Because he already knew that

387
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,510
the Blood-freezing Frost

388
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,680
was the antidote to the Swift Wind Pill.

389
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,920
This is also why

390
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,270
the Unstoppable Old Man, who could have

391
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,200
easily neutralized

392
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,000
the poison Old Bug placed on him,

393
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,070
still died from the poison.

394
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,440
Because at that time,
the Unstoppable Old Man

395
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,270
made the most righteous choice.

396
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,020
[Food as Medicine]

397
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,590
The Unstoppable Old Man,
in his quest to develop

398
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,790
the antidote for the Swift Wind Pill,

399
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,830
tested poisons on himself multiple times

400
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,680
and was then ambushed and poisoned
by Old Bug,

401
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,200
missing the optimal time
for detoxification.

402
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,750
In his final moments,

403
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,300
he fulfilled the mission
entrusted by our fathers.

404
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,750
Master!

405
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,510
But he didn't have time

406
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,400
to tell others how to use it.

407
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,030
That's why the Blood-freezing Frost

408
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:14,090
has always been considered a poison.

409
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,270
I didn't lose.

410
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,030
I didn't lose to you.

411
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,310
I clearly won.

412
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,460
You did indeed beat me,

413
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,400
but you also truly lost.

414
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,720
Justice prevails,

415
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,680
and righteousness endures.

416
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,200
You lost to the righteous spirit

417
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,510
of countless people
over these past 20 years.

418
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,240
No.

419
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,550
I understand now.

420
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,640
It's fate.

421
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,200
It's heaven.

422
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:41,000
It's the heavenly way
that won't let me win!

423
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,920
Even now,

424
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,510
it still favors you!

425
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,160
You once asked me

426
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,200
if you joined the Elite Constabulary Unit

427
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,440
and I joined the Pingyuan Escort Agency,

428
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,750
what would become of you

429
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,280
and what would become of me.

430
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,040
I didn't answer you then,

431
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,400
but I can give you

432
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,240
my answer now.

433
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,680
If that were the case,

434
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:09,720
you might have become

435
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,550
a better Beiming,

436
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,200
but I

437
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,880
would never have become

438
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,000
a more wicked Bei Kun.

439
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,440
What makes you so sure?

440
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,200
Because in this world,

441
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,400
there will always be suffering,

442
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,030
and there will always be

443
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,720
people who are not favored by fate.

444
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,110
But suffering and hatred cannot be

445
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,440
reasons to harm the innocent.

446
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,240
Even if such suffering

447
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,400
had befallen me,

448
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,980
I still firmly believe

449
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,830
that if

450
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,890
Miao Jie had appeared before me then,

451
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,750
I would never have done

452
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,830
what you did.

453
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,000
That's because you don't know

454
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,400
where your roots lie!

455
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,200
But I do.

456
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,880
As someone from Haiya,

457
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,960
I did nothing wrong

458
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,310
seeking revenge for Haiya!

459
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,310
But what about those Haiya orphans?

460
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:42,680
Zhu Yitie,

461
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,720
Qing Ying,

462
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,370
and Huang Wuchang.

463
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,440
They weren't all living in hardship.

464
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,680
Some could even have lived peaceful lives,

465
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,750
yet because of you,

466
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,250
they all died tragically.

467
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:53,790
Luo Shu, Luo Sen,

468
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,680
Xing, Xiaoyue,

469
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,160
and all your fellow Haiya people—

470
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,030
which one of them

471
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,310
has lived a better life because of you?

472
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,240
You keep saying

473
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,000
you were doing it for Haiya,

474
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,510
but when have you

475
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,640
truly cared about Haiya in your heart?

476
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:08,400
You feel pain from your past misfortunes,

477
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,800
and because of that pain,

478
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,030
you demand that others

479
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,360
suffer just as you have.

480
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,030
Because of your selfish desires,

481
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:16,090
you've caused countless tragedies.

482
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,270
How is the evil you've inflicted
on the Qi Kingdom

483
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,110
any different from

484
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,160
what the Qi Kingdom

485
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,420
did to Haiya back then?

486
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,080
Today you seek revenge against
the Qi Kingdom,

487
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,680
but who'll bear the Qi Kingdom's hatred

488
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,000
in the future?

489
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,030
Actually, you've had many chances

490
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,030
to turn back.

491
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:43,790
The moment I left with Miao Jie,

492
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:44,510
I knew

493
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,550
there would be

494
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:47,880
no chance for me

495
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,510
to ever turn back in this life.

496
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,110
Back in the underground waterway,

497
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,270
when Xueman and I were trying to escape,

498
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,470
we found explosives all over the walls.

499
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:56,790
You could have easily

500
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:57,990
blown us all to death,

501
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,850
but instead, you merely

502
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:02,710
trapped us inside the mechanism.

503
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,640
I just wanted you all

504
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,790
to witness the fall of the Qi Kingdom
with your own eyes.

505
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,000
But I lost.

506
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,240
That cenotaph

507
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,970
built for Tong Shuang in Haiya,

508
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,550
you saw it,

509
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,110
didn't you?

510
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,680
Some things

511
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,000
are just beyond my reach

512
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,240
in this lifetime.

513
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,960
But you once had them in your grasp.

514
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:17,920
My brother.

515
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,880
If there's a next life,

516
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,220
it's best that you and I never meet again.

517
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:53,490
♪ I drift in the wind like grass ♪

518
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,960
